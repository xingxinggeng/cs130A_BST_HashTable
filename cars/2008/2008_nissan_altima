<TEXT>We've owned our Altima since March of 2008 and haven't had one mechanical problem. It rides smoothly and quietly, especially with the CVT transmission. The exterior is sporty looking but the paint chips easily. The Key has been nothing but problems. One of the buttons is already missing while the paint chipped on another one. Not to mention it always sets off the car alarm unintentionally. The interior is nice looking and the dash is well laid-out. It also looks nice lit up at night. There are plenty of cup holders, but the plastics are cheap especially on the doors, where they are all scratched and damaged after only a year. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cool styling, Lots of cupholders, dash buttons are easy to read, roomy, reliable</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having purchased a dealership test drive car with 3,000 KM (1,600 miles) I benefited from my White Altima coupe 3.5 SE Premium being 'broken in' without being abused. Almost two years with the car now and I'm still taken by the beauty of the interior and exterior design! I'm in snowy Calgary Canada and appreciate the foul weather control of front wheel drive. I consider the Altima coupe to be a great balance of performance, comfort, style and practicality. A well designed car that sacrifices little and offers a lot. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good fuel economy for a V-6, smooth and powerful engine, bose audio, comfortable seats good for long drives, quiet interior, feels solid and stable on highway.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have a 2008 Altima SE V6 and this is by far the most uncomfortable seats I have ever had. I downsized from a 2007 Infiniti M35 those seats were OK. Before I bought the Altima I had read several posts in Edmunds about uncomfortable seats on long drives and I should have listened better. It only takes 5 minutes and my back starts hurting. I do have back problems but this pain is different. It feels like there is no support in some areas especially left side. I have bought padded lumbar cushions but it did not help much. I would invest in custom seats if it would help but if not I am going take loss and get another car but what car in this class has superior comfort?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V6 CVT Handling Styling far better than Honda Accord or Camry. Keyless entry and proximity sensor. Leg room and passenger space. Large trunk</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am really not happy with the ride of this vehicle, my driving is mostly in the city and the vehicle does not take the pot holes & various bumps that you find in most Cities. On the freeway the ride is very good. I had complained to Nissan Northern Regional in Canada and they referred me my dealership locally and they inspected the suspension system and said nothing was wrong with it that is how it was manufactured, well I sort of expected tho, to no avail! But on the more positive side the car is really a nice car, nice styling and the engine is a little noisy but runs good it is too bad that it's suspension is not adequate to give a more comfortable ride overall.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Yes, of course; the styling is stunning and alot of people eye ball my flaming red car as I drive by, my ego trip. Very fond of the CVT transmission and the 4 cylinder engine is really peppy get at least 30mpg on freeway but only 16mpg in the city (kind of disappointed with that). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Before I saw the 2008 Altima, my mind was set on a Camry, but after seeing and reading about the Altima, my mind changed. I had to have an Altima. I look forward to driving it each day. I love the keyless entry, keyless start and the CVT transmission. No digging in my purse for the key!! I have so much fun driving it.The gas mileage is awesome. Bottom line, I love my Altima!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought car 3/08 and now have over 16k. So far no trips back to the dealer. Getting 24mpg in suburban driving and averaging 30-31 highway at 70-75mph. Very happy with gas mileage with all this power. Continental tires have provided smooth quiet ride to go with extremely quiet engine, which compliments a great sound system. Have found seats very comfortable for long drives. Gauges and buttons easy to use/follow. Trunk plenty spacious and nice having fold down split rear seats. Worth having the leather seats (heated - works great) and the other additional options like heated mirrors. Worth it. Debated between the 4 & 6. Worth it to pay for the 6 for the quiet and powerful engine</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good gas mileage with all that power. You need to pass someone quickly - no problem. Quiet engine. Superb Bose sound system. Problem free. Key Fob nice BUT I'm blowing through batteries in both units every month. I'd buy this car again and recommend it based on my experience.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>dont_buy_the_6-speed</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have owned this car for 10 months and it drove superb when I first purchased it, but the Edmunds.com editor was correct when he says that the 6-speed manual transmission should be avoided. In the winter, the gears began to grind, crunch, pop. I tried a dealer recommended synthetic oil and it helps slightly but even in the summer there is considerable gear grinding. Master clutch cylinder had silent recall; clutch pedal made reverberating "socket-wrench" sound until this was replaced. Nissan consumer affairs lacks technical knowledge and unhelpful and would not offer any suggestions to correct gear-grinding, it seems to be a common problem so please avoid 6-spd and go with the CVT</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage close to 28 MPG (lots of stop & go city driving), great style and peppy performance, quiet and smooth ride, very nice sound system with deep bass, smart key feature with key-less ignition and entry is my favorite part of the car and something that I will greatly miss when i trade it in</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've always driven Nissans. My last car was a Maxima, but I fell in love with the look of this Altima. The keyless entry is awesome especially when dealing with small children so you can have an extra hand rather than fumbling around looking for a key. I never thought I'd go from a V6 to a 4 cyl but the ride is real smooth and it still gets pretty good pick up. Haven't had any problems and never did with any Nissan I had. I put some chrome rims and grills on it and get compliments all the time on it. I'm definitely happy inside and out!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had about 10 weeks and 3,623 miles in my fully loaded 3.5SE. Overall, let me just say that I love my Altima. After A LOT of research (spreadsheets comparing mpg, leg room, head room, insurance costs, etc), I know I made the right decision. The 3.5 receives outstanding marks by Ward?s Best Engines. Performance is exceptional, and the CVT took getting used to, but now I have trouble going back to a normal auto. The Altima is comfortable, and has great front leg room, and rear leg room exceeds my ?03 Accord, the BMW 5-series, and MB E-Class. I have averaged 21.8mpg city, and 29.4mpg hwy on a 1,152 mile trip (I don't drive slow). This means more room, mpg, and power than the E350 or 528i.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The CVT is awesome. The nav system is intuitive, and NavTraffic has saved me twice. Interior materials are of high quality, and dials/buttons feel great. Intelligent key is great, and no less secure than the "old way". Oddly large glove compartment (6.5"Hx11.5"Wx16.5"D = my 17.1" Dell laptop fits)!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well I have had the car for about 2 months now. There are a lot of things I like and some I don't. I traded in a fullsize truck for this car, so getting used to the smallness off the interior, and the low ground clearance has been tough. Also the lack of comfort and the road noise. I live in Alaska so some of the roads aren't smooth. I do however like the gas mileage. I am getting a little more than 550 mi. On a tank. That's mixed. The interior fabric is cheap ultra suede. Cannot be cleaned! I don't like the cheap plastic interior. For the price it should be much nicer. Am not totally happy with the car and find myself wishing for something else.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The window sticker says 23-33 mpg, the mpg gauge on the dash says 32 mpg highway and 23 mpg city, but in actuality it only gets 21 mpg city and 26 mpg highway. These tests were done under very controlled fill up and driving conditions (I was an engineering technician with GM Research Labs). Our 4cyl Camry did much better than this. We bought the Altima because it was a little smaller than the Camry and thought it would get better mileage. Consumer reports gives the 4cyl Altima 18 mpg city. Feel like we were scammed. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>BEWARE OF HEATER</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>When you put the heater on the foot only position the heat comes out mainly from the windshield defrost and not the feet. If you put the heat on the foot/defrost position it performs the exact same function. My problem is I'm 4"10 and the defrost blows right in my face which is gagging me. My husband is 6" 1 and it dries out his contacts. I have contacted 3 dealers and the manufacturer who say that is the way the car is made. My point is why have two buttons if they both perform the exact same function. No one can give me an answer to that so I'm stuck with this horrible heater blowing in my face. Also the face vents tilt but do not close so you have air hitting you from there too!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>2.5 SL CVT, with the connection package. I have never written a review for anything before but after all the helpful advise I read here before I purchased, I had to return the favor. I cannot be happier with this car. Have owned 1 yr, right at 17K miles, still just as excited about it as when I drove it off the lot. Looked at Camry and Accord, never even thought about this and then decided to check it out and something just stuck with me. Excellent performance for a 4 cylinder. Never been starved for power. Avg 27-29 mpg per tank with mixed hgwy and city, and I don't hold back on the peddle. Smoothest transmission I ever felt. Love all the extras too. Great car for the money. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Never been much of a stereo person but the Bose system rocks. Don't know how I ever lived without Bluetooth and keyless feature before, I will never be able to go back to living without. Good gas mileage, If only highway you can average 32-35, I just sit in a lot of traffic. CVT is a wonderful thing</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my SUV for a small car after gas started to rapidly rise...wasn't convinced I'd love the new car, but did it anyway to save money. Best thing I have done in a long time! My Altima is much more spacious than it looks and gets awesome gas mileage. I average 34 MPG on my daily commute. I have recommended to many of my friends and family who are complaining of the gas prices.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Altima coupe has the best-looking backend of any car out there at any price. Look at it from the rear and a little to the side and its a joy to behold. The 4 cylinders get you up to speed without even trying. Back seat has more headroom (slightly) than the Scion tC and Civic coupe -- but a 6-footer's head might touch the rear window. Not sure about mileage. I'm still on the first tank, but it seems fairly decent. Front seats are very comfortable, with good driver's lumbar support. Driver's leg compartment is more comfortable than Civic coupe, where the parking hand brake bothered my knee, and more spacious than the Mazda 3 sedan that crowded my lower leg. A lot of quality for the money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is awesome! It is my first automatic, my first 4 door sedan and my first Nissan. I got it loaded - 3.5 SE V6 + Prem package and nav/XM. IS 250 had too small of a backseat, the 328i was out of my price range and I'm just not a Mercedes girl. I love to drive around with the windows down, the sunroof open and the Bose speakers blaring. Perfect for those sunny San Diego days. The CVT engine is great but takes a little time to get used to if you are a manual transmission girl at heart like me. Overall a great ride! Previously owned a Ford and 2 Mitsus. What a difference! My friend has a 2008 G35 and this is basically the same car. All the same features and $10k less. Sold!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 3.5 SE comes with sport tuned suspension and 17" wheels, add on Prem and Tech and you've got everything! Push button start, keyless entry, leather, back-up camera, sunroof, iPod aux, dark slate color, nav, XM, smooth ride, powerful V6 (ready on a dime), decent gas mileage for a hefty engine!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned the new 2008 Altima 2.5 S for just over 2-month with 2500 miles on it. It is a truly amazing car with outstanding gas mileage and fun to drive. I got 31 mpg on mixed city/hwy driving. It is fun to drive with plenty of ponies to spare on the hwy. The CVT is very smooth and the rev rarely over 2000 rpm even at 70 mph. Five-star crash test rating gives me a peace of mind. Having owned three Toyota Camry and one Honda Accord, I must say the Nissan Altima is way better and with the money saved enough for a nice Bahama vacation package. I just hope Nissan would make a diesel version of the Altima in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my Altima today and love it. My wife preferred a Camry but she doesn't appreciate the better handling of the Altima like I do. It has a slight vibration at low speeds but the dealership assures me it is the tires having flat spots from sitting in the lot so long. It did seem to get better today as I drove 85 miles. I simply LOVE the car. I am 60 and it is the best all around car I have ever owned - quiet at all speeds, comfortable, very economical (if I can believe the instantaneous mileage readout) and gorgeous. Nissan hit a home run with this one. I got the Jade Green color with Blond interior and love it. The AC is superb and I absolutely LOVE the handling and CVT.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Okay, so I have the 2.5S CVT 4 Door with Convenience Package. Great car, smooth ride, good gas mileage considering my lead foot. The 4cyl blew the doors off my friend 4cyl accord, and picks up and hauls! The tires are GREAT in the rain, but the large sidewall makes the performance during turns and quick maneuvers quite sloppy. The spoiler definitely makes it look classy. I had to have my door repainted fresh off the lot due to poor clearcoat application and discoloration of paint. I was quite upset. Now my window doesnt have auto up. Just down. I have had 2 Nissan prior to this and one Infiniti. I am disappointed that this car has had this many "issues" in less than 2500 miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a courier and drive this car about 180 miles/day. I had an 07 Camry and averaged about 23 mpg, I've been getting about 26.5 average in the Altima only change I notice is the low rpm at high speed. Very smooth ride and acceleration. No hesitation when you hit the gas to pass another car. Should have XM radio standard. Much more fun to drive than my Camry, tires are MUCH cheaper to replace. Performance+ pkg is a great deal for what you get. The push button start is GREAT! The CVT (continuous variable transmission) is VERY nice and I wasn't expecting to notice such a difference.You'll notice it within a minute of your test drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased my Altima 2 weeks ago, but, so far, I?m thrilled. Nissan wasn?t on my radar initially, but after a good bit of research (mostly on Edmunds), I decided to give it a look. I was really impressed by the overall package, the styling, the ride, the performance are all great considering the overall price. And the gas mileage ratings were as good or better than anything else I was considering, while the 2.5L engine has sufficient pep. It had the most bang for the buck of the vehicles I test drove, by a comfortable margin. Two weeks in, I have no complaints, still quite pleased with the purchase. I?m getting right about 29 mpg, with a mix of commuting and in- town driving. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The SL package ? I?m quickly getting used to niceties such as leather seats, moonroof, and the keyless start. And the dual climate control is my wife?s favorite feature. With the gas mileage and an 18-gallon tank, the range is approaching 500 miles. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With gas prices soaring and my Jeep Wrangler eeking out a pathetic 14 mpg average, I had to do something about it. At 6'4", I needed a vehicle that would accommodate my size and be useful for an upcoming baby. I just didn't fit without my head bumping the roof in the new Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, and Hyundai Sonata. But, much to my surprise, the Nissan Altima was a winner in terms of "fit." I'm very impressed with the power of the 4- cylinder, which felt much like what I had in my old V6 Accord. It rides very smooth, quiet and is refined. I'm very glad I bought this vehicle and have absolutely no buyer's remorse. It has a great aggressive style to it and wonderful for touring.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Keyless functions. Quiet and smooth ride. Feels solid. Excellent A/C. Excellent controls. Great room (front seats). Superb styling. Safety features are top-notch. Tires are exceptional.

<TEXT>This car is excellent and is a very comfortable family sedan overall. It handles extremely well in rain storms and any inclement weather. Heavy water on the roadway does not affect its traction nor does it pull on the steering wheel, as it did on my 2005 Altima. The 6 cylinder is definitely not necessary as the 4 cyl acceleration is smooth and powerful. Though it is not as sporty to drive as the 2005, the turning circle radius is much better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really can't say anything negative about this vehicle. It is truly a sport coupe. Don't buy this car if you are not interested in a sport car but just like the looks. It has a very sporty ride (sport tuned suspension) and rides like it's on rails, superb handling. Acceleration is excellent and the CVT (continuously variable transmission) shifts seamlessly when in drive mode. You can manually shift it as well. My wife and I call it a baby Z. It is a really fun car to drive and I would highly recommend it as an affordable sport car that can hold its own.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove the new Accord, Camry, and Altima. Bottom line, the Altima drove the best and had the best mileage. I now have 9000 on my 6 speed manual, 2.5S with convenience pkg plus and it has be a blast. Steering is awesome, its comfortable, roomy, I get 35-38 mpg, no lie!!! With all this, it was much cheaper than either the Accord or Camry. The 6 spd manual is hard to find, but worth the search for sure. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a 2008 Nissan Altima, trusting into Nissan. Instead I got something unbelievable. It had nothing but problems. The tires wore out after 5,000 miles and I asked the dealer and he said the Altima comes stock with cheap tires and are expected to wear out soon. Also the paint chips off as if it were cheaply done, and the interior seats rip. I would recommend the Camry over this car any time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is amazing. It drives beautifully. I love everything about it. The Bose stereo sounds great. It's so fuel efficient, such a nice change from a 98 Chevy Blazer. The look of the car is hot and I love that you don't see a ton of them on the road. I have the premium package and its so worth every penny. The bluetooth sounds so clear. I love the push start button. The features of the car are great and I'm so glad I own this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car back in December of 07 and I have nothing but good things to say about it. I have always been a fan of Nissans, but this car is "the truth". Due to gas prices I opted for the 2.5s but it still packs plenty of power. The power steering is extremely smooth and the ride is quiet. My friends with Accords and Camrys immediately fall in love after driving the Altima. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Push button start is amazing. CVT is also amazing and the gas mileage is actually a little better than advertised. I don't do much city driving, but I've been averaging 34-35 mpg on the highway (with AC on). Stock stereo is pretty decent as well. Glove box is huge.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have wanted Nissan to come out with an Altima coupe for years now! They finally made one, and it is a beauty! I love my 2.5S coupe, and it fits me like a glove. When I first bought the car, the tires really needed breaking in. Once they had a few miles on them, the car became a lot more steady at high speeds (70-80 mph). My gas mileage continues to improve too! At first, I was only getting 22 mpg city. Now, even with the air conditioning, I'm getting 30 mpg in the city!! The longer I have it, the more it's breaking in. This car is only getting better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks - gorgeous inside and out, CVT - smooth transmission, gas mileage (30 mpg in city, 34 mpg highway), power - can pass on the highway with ease, comfort - fits like a glove</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really like this car. I would rather have had the 3.5L V6, but given the fact that it takes premium fuel, gas prices, blah blah blah you get the picture. Very good A to B car in style, and somewhat fun to drive. Creature comforts with the convenience package are very nice. Car is very sophisticated looking for the price. It's my first new car, and I will keep it for at least 5 years provided that no idiot(s) run into it and break it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It has been 3 months and 3 thousand miles since my purchase. The car rides smooth and quiet. I test drove a 4 and it had enough power but I was willing to sacrifice some mpg for a very quiet 6. I'm noise sensitive. Getting 24 mpg suburban driving, highway 28-29 with a ton of get up and go! Bose sound system is fabulous with the quiet engine. Interior feels very spacious. Dash not cluttered. Controls nicely positioned. Nice leg space. Trunk offers plenty of suitcase and stuff space. Good sight lines through rear window when backing up. The transmission is very smooth, quiet, and easy to get used to. No need for a stick shift. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Like a lot of people I am downsizing. My previous vehicle was a Chevy Avalanche which I loved. I felt like it was going to be a shock moving down to a small car but it really hasn't been that bad. Has a great solid ride and I love the CVT. One thing I've noticed is the performance when you have it on cruise control. Every vehicle I've had before you would have a lag and then rapid acceleration when you went up a hill. Not with this car. It just plugs on along no matter the terrain and this has to be because of the transmission. Interior is roomy with a lot of storage which is important to me because I carry around a lot of stuff for my work. Glove box is huge. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned my fully loaded Altima coupe for 6 months and so far: it has been a great experience. The interior styling is classy and the dash layout makes using all its features easy to use. As far as the exterior goes: this car is a head turner. Beautiful to look at. I've gone on several trips of over 2 hours and find the seats to be perfectly comfortable - for two people. Also, the gas tank holds about 18 gallons so there are fewer refueling stops than you'd expect. Especially considering it has power to take off and still has less fuel consumption than any V6. I test drove the Accord, Camry, and Mustang and in my opinion: you get the most out of your hard earned money with the Altima.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the interior and exterior styling to the new Altima coupe. I own the 2.5S and I find it has both good fuel economy and great performance. Also, the fact that I can have the keys in my pocket and simply press a button to start it makes jumping in and taking off that much easier!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car was recommended by my mechanic, he told me if I were to buy a Japan car, I should consider the Altima bcause it has a chain drive belt. It will outlast the others. I bought the Altima 2.5s for my wife, But I enjoy the ride as much as she does! The 175 ponies under the hood feels like a V6. The handling is like a small Caddy. And the steering is real tight and responsive. I only have 285 miles on it but at 10 MPH I shift into manual on the CVT to 5th or 6th gear and the revs go way down. I can get 37+ MPG by doing this. I'm sure after break-in it will only get better. What a lot of car for the money. Great gas mileage, great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the new '08 Altima, I shopped around between an accord, camry, malibu, and even a 3 series and still loved the altima more! This car won't let you down. When you need the power to pass in a short passing zone, all it takes is a little bit more pressure on the gas pedal and your gone. The CVT is way more favorable than I expected, although the engine is a bit more noticeable. Comfy cloth seats with microfiber trim, but everything does stick to the microfiber.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've always been a person that always bought American vehicles, so this is my first Nissan. My family needed another vehicle because we have a child and needed better gas milage than my 06 Dodge Ram. This car is great!!! Handles great, ample space throughout, SL & Technology Package gave us everything we needed. This car gets about 19 mpg in the city and about 28 on the highway so we are saving soo much money on gas. I think Nissan has a winner with the Altima, I'd definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for more bang for the buck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a 2.5S Coupe (Precision Grey) and had 2 problems already. After having it for 5 days, the car would only start after pushing the start button 15+ times (which the service technician claims it's a defective battery - we'll see) and the a/c compressor has to be replaced (was making a rattling noise). I've had an altima since it debuted in '92 and had no problems with its previous versions. I'm hoping that the new coupe doesn't prove me that Nissan is now marketing more on design and failing on overall reliablility.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The coupe design is a plus. CVT, responsive brakes, stiff suspension, relatively low blindspots for a coupe, and room rear seats for a coupe. The keyless entry and start up are quite a novelty item. Only time will tell if it's durable and reliable.</FAVORITE>

The thing runs like a good v-6 would but its only a 4 banger! The one thing I don't like is that it feels like your falling out of the seat forward. I have to recline the back of the seat further than I would like so that it feels like I'm not falling forward. I also find the tire pressure warning light annoying.

In the end we decided to test drive an Altima just for the heck of it, not really having considered it in the beginning. We immediately fell in love with the smooth quiet ride, power off the line, smoothness of the CVT, and push-button start!

<TEXT>At first, the CVT is weird. But after a while, I got used to it and start to have fun. Semi-auto is responsive. I used to have a Prelude. The only different btw these 2 is one has V6, the other 4 cylinder V-tech, take your pick. Rear-view camara is very useful (at least for my wife). Plenty of power. 3 inches more head room than Accord & Camry given that I have a "longer" torso and it's more comfy in this than in those 2 cars.

The bad: owners manual and dvd are vague on some operations, trip computer cumbersome to operate. Uses time to mileage rating that is grossly inaccurate unles reset each time you start moving! Psgr seat does not reset to preset back position when tipped forward, resets to an uncomfortable 90 degree position requiring manual reset. Initiate XM radio directions are non existent, user left on own to figure out. The ugly: power steering is over sensative, subject to wondering and oversteering at highway speeds but handles great otherwise. Smart key=big $</TEXT>

For the bread, this is by far, the best deal. I feel good in this car, and enjoy many of the stares it gets. I have the slate color, with the convenience pkg. The seats are firm, but comfortable, even at 6'3, 230 pounds. My son is 6'5, he loves my car, and hijacks it from me every time he comes home, lol. I would highly recommend this car to anyone. Makes me feel young again. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling, keyless entry, CVT, and its quickness. Nice to have several cup holders in both front and back. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you're in the market for a midsize sedan, this is THE car to buy! I did a lot of reading and test driving of different sedans, and in the end, the Altima beat the Camry and Accord handily. Not only was the price far below the Camry and Accord, but the features list was higher than either of those choices as well! I got a 2.5 SL w/ Connection Package and the Bluetooth phone system rocks! The ikey and push-button start are so cool! The leather seats are very comfortable, and the controls are very intuitive and easy to use. The car is a blast to drive on curvy roads. It's also very peppy for a 4cyl. If you're looking for a new midsize sedan, check this out!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Intelligent key, push-button start, Bluetooth, XM radio, heated leather seats, CVT w/ manual shift, Homelink, trip computer, sunroof, huge trunk, powerful 4-cyl, everything! Steering feel is great for spirited driving. It's amazing!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my 350z convertible for the Altima SL in november 07 because i needed more space.Never regretted the trade. I love the altima. Getting the L package was worth the money. None of my friends can believe the price. From the gas milage, 28 in the city to 35 on the freeway, to the comfort and space, this car is a bargain. The style is sporty,yet elegant. the trunk is spacious and so is the backseat. My son is 6'2" and has no problem in the backseat. Power is more than sufficient and the CVT works great. i took it on a 1500 mile roundtrip to San Antonio and never was uncomfortable. And i am 6'3". All things considered, my next car will be an Altima again when the time comes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Request key feature and push button start.Controls are easy to reach. No more fumbling for keys. The body styling is really great and has a faint resemblance to the 350z. MP3 connection and 2 power outlets come in handy. Amatures are easy to read and the their lighting during the day works great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Altima is a lot of fun. It's the first new car I've ever owned, and it's neat to chart how it feels for the first thousand miles, and the next. I use the cruise control for long straight freeway trips, and get 32 MPG. In town, more like 24. I'm 6'3" and it fits me well. I think it really comes down to the rocket under the hood. I've never been happier to get behind the wheel and GO somewhere. It's really a great ride and I wholly recommend it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>First let me say I love this car. I have had 4 weeks now and it is fun to drive. My only problem with it is that the Nav and phone have most of their features disabled when the car is moving. It's a car, these features should work while you are in it. I am now forced to fumble with my phone if I want to make a call, that is precisely the reason I bought a car with bluetooth, so I could be safe and not have to do this while the car was moving. In order to access your phone book the car must be stopped. In order to pick a new destination you have to stop the car, please make it so the passenger can operate the toys</TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving Toyotas for the last 20 years I was a bit apprehensive about buying a car that didn't say Toyota on it. But after driving my new 2008 Nissan Altima Coupe 2.5S I am totally impressed. It handles great, has tons of power, looks beautiful and gets an avg of over 28 mpg. Not bad considering I have been driving rather heavy footed. The seats take a little getting use to and the plastic on the inside of the car has an inexpensive feel to it. Not cheap but not too good either. The CVT is amazing. I think it and the engine are a great match. Nice job Nissan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned 5 Honda Accords over the last 15 years. I was about ready to buy another when I test drove the Altima. Immediately I could feel the difference. The Hondas are very smooth, reliaable and actually boring. I found the Altima fun to drive. I like the car more every day even though I've only had it for a month. The leather seats seem more comfortable than the Accord and I like the home link. Hats off to Nissan for finally making a car that I feel is comparable and even better than my reliable, plain Hondas. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Altima is the best car in its class. Totally awesome good looks, sporty and extremely economical. I do a 50/50 split hwy and city. During normal driving mid 30s fuel economy. If I baby it, I've gotton close to 40 mpg. Gauges are easy to read day or night. Standard halogen lamps, push start, all standard. I love the fact that I never have to pull the keys out of my pocket. The 4cyl Altima easily beats 4 cyl Accord and Camry of the line and passes better as well. All for a car that is in the low 20s.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My second review since buying in June of 07. The fuel economy is not good at all. Lucky to get 20 mpg in local driving. I live in the country where the roads are hilly and expect the mpg to be down a bit but can't see how I would ever get 25-27. The CVT is so intrusive at times, everytime the car goes downhill or around a corner with a downgrade it downshifts. At times this seems great but not all the time. Leaves you wondering. However I think if you live in less hilly areas performance would be better.</TEXT>

Does not handle like a BMW or Saab Aero, but will walk away from most with its 270 hp. Car has a solid feel and fresh design. Big enough to actually carry normal sized people! CVT is so smooth and has a nice manual mode - first automatic trans I've owned in 22 years - its that good.

I folded the back seats down to use for storage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Everything is great but I am disappointed with MPG. I average 26 and do mostly highway driving. Thought I would get 30 mpg. Also, the nav system is bad compared to garmin or others. It is stupid how to save a point, forcing you to go out and around and back it to name it. Also can not access your saved points while the car is moving. I feel stopping on a highway is FAR more dangerous than accessing your saved points as you get near your destination. Stay away from remote start, 3 tries and they still can not get it right with the push button start. My suggestion is NOT to go for the technology package. Voice command does not work either. Other than that I recommend the car.</TEXT>

After about 1000 miles, I can say the car is great, and I have no regrets. I would buy the same car again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I was looking for a new car, nothing stood out more than the Nissan Altima Coupe. The look of the car and its uniqueness on the road alone sold me. It is very fun to drive and responsive for me. The seats are perfect and the basic package brought what I needed and not the extras I honestly see as unnecessary. The 4 liters saves gas and since I am a penny pincher with little money, this helps a lot and trust me, it can keep up on the highway. While you may find some gripe with the car, such as small trunk space and no existent back seat, honestly, this car is perfect for me as a teenage driver. Honestly, with 4 liters, I get the power I need and my parents do not have to worry like a V6.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The size of the car on the exterior is perfect for safety. Mileage is awesome compared to my mom! The sportiness is perfect and the car is powerful for a 4 liter. The look of the car is what truly draws in the crowd. Also the uniqueness on the road helps a lot too.</FAVORITE>

Really appreciate the standard iPod jack (some other manufacturers charge extra) though I hate its location - the cable runs down the console to the IiPod. The 2.5 S base model is a bargain for the money when bought right. The CVT is far superior to conventional automatic transmission. Keyless entry is great! Code Red is gorgeous and my black cloth interior is nice enough I didn't need the leather. I bought an unobtrusive aftermarket Stillen spoiler which really makes the car turn heads! </TEXT>

We were looking to purchase a 2008 Pontiac G6, but decided first test-drive the Altima before purchasing the G6. We both loved the Altima so much after our test drive that we purchased the vehicle that same day. We also own a 2007 GMC Envoy, but the Nissan is a much better ride. I was fairly sure that the next car I was going to purchase was going to be a General Motors vehicle, but Nissan makes too superior of a vehicle. I encourage anyone that is shopping for a safe and comfortable car to test drive the Altima. You will not be disappointed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really do like my 2.5S, but when accelerating from a stop, between 25-45 mph there is a noticeable missing and loss of power. The dealership's service dept. could find nothing wrong with it, and suggested that I had gotten some "bad gas." I upped the octane from 87-89 before they even suggested this. One of the reasons I bought the car was for it's good gas mileage. If I end up having to buy super premium gas for it to run well, I have defeated my purpose. Also, there is little lumbar support in the driver's seat which makes long drives uncomfortable. Otherwise, I really like the car...</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the car the summer of 2007 everything was fine until 3000 miles. I noticed a faint knock coming from the engine bay so I took it to the dealer for a check. The service adviser told me that I was using the wrong oil filter, not! Second visit they told me it was a heat shield, not! Finally, I got them to admit the knock is from inside the engine and got some inside info as well. They told me that engine parts are from different vendors so quality varies from part to part? The engine knock was from a piston slap in the block and that most 2.5l suffer from it, right around the first oil change and on. Nissan is aware of the issue but claims that there is no excessive damage so SOL..?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my 3.5 SE coupe for 6 months now and really love it! My favorite feature is the CVT in the shift mode - lots of fun to drive out here in the country. Haven't had any mechanical problems but only has 5,000 miles on it. Drove it all winter and had no problems with the snow (live in Toledo Ohio so we've had our share). Everyone in work loves the way it looks - precision gray with black leather. Car is a little nosier on the highway than my Monte Carlo SS was but this is my first foreign car so I guess I need to get used to it. Salesman didn't tell me the car needs to run on high test gas - gets about 21 mpg city/hw </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 3.5SE cvt 1 year ago and almost immediately noticed slight movement in the power driver seat. I figured something needed tightening or adjusted but 1 year later and 4 visits to the dealer and the answer I'm getting is that I'm not the only one with this issue and Nissan is aware but does not have a solution yet. I can't believe I have a 32K car that I HATE now because of movement. Google Nissan Altima Seat squirm and you will find others with the same complaints. I doubt they have corrected the problem with the 09's but BEWARE. I've also had quite a few rattles that are frustrating me. I've had an Xterra and an 05 Titan that were well made but this will be my last Nissan.</TEXT>

I can't even move once I seat, otherwise I'll hear squeaky noise. I have contacted customer service and they keep telling me, they will fix the problem. No resolution. Also, I had problem with engine rattling. I had to take it in 3 times before tech can hear the problem. they fix this problem, but the problem is coming back now. NEVER BUY NISSAN CARS EVER. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car since October. This is the best car that I have ever owned. It drives great. I love the CVT except when going down hills. The transmission makes a humming noise. The dealer said this was normal and there was nothing to worry about. I like the keyless remote except I have to keep my windows and trunk locked, because they were opening. The dealer said that if the button hit something, that they could open your window and trunk. The only thing I didn't like was how Nissan packages their options. I really did not want a sun roof, but to get the leather seats, I had to get the sun roof. Also, I wished the outside mirrors would fold down.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well I just bought it a week ago and so far I love everything about the car! It has a wonderful drive and even with a 4 cyl the put up is amazing! Coming from a V6 I was a little worried but the pickup really surprised me. The only thing I can think of that I would change would be the leg room for the driver. Being a very long legged person, after a long drive the leg room falls a little short. Other than that, so far this is by far the best sedan I've ever owned!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I actually put up an '07 for an '08 with more options, and both vehicles have been absolutely wonderful, and a BLAST to drive. GREAT fuel economy as I'm averaging 22-23 in cold temperatures, higher in the summer. Lots of options, and a GREAT value for the amount that you get. Wonderful performance, and the push-button start/Intelligent Key system is extremely convenient. I actually traded a Lexus for the '07, and I don't miss it a bit. The CVT is a great transmission as well, although it does take some adjusting to. It makes great use of the power band all throughout the RPM range, plus it has a surprisingly accurate manual mode.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2.5 SL CVT. 250 miles. Very classy styling and interior. Dealer installed moonroof baffle and fog lights. Linking fogs with Tech package is just dumb, but dealer installed fogs with small rocker switch on lower left instrument panel which was made for it. Should be included in SL! Displayed mileage is 35 at 45 mph. Drops to 31.5 at 70 mph. My 6 cyl. 97 Avalon delivers 32-34 mpg at 70 mph, so not impressive, but per Nissan specs. Suburban/light-city mileage about 28 which is 6 better than Avalon, though. Acceleration with 4cyl/CVT is more than enough. Ride is more sports coupe like-you feel the bumps. Will ask dealer to look at air whistle in closed moon roof - otherwise nothing wrong.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, keyless ignition!, leather, acceleration, Bose/XM, mpg display (real informative), roomy interior, rear view mirror auto dimming, heated seats (it is Wisconsin!), dual temp zone control, handling (not ride). CVT is nice, but not noticeably smoother than my conventional automatic Avalon. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I previously leased an 05 Altima 2.5S and absolutely loved that car. I was a little nervous about leasing the 08, hoping that they knocked all the kinks of the new model out. This car truly is awesome!! They bumped up the safety features by making side curtain air bags and ABS brakes standard. I now have 8 speakers instead of 6, don't let the stock fool you. Plug in your iPod and the car is amazingly loud, don't need any kickers here!!!! CVT is really nice, no kick backs or sudden jolts, just nice and smooth. I've only had the car for a few weeks so the MPG aren't too great but hopefully in the future it will be better.</TEXT>

We traded in an 02 Passat which had lots of interior space, but the Altima actually has more. We have two small children and everyone fits in the car very comfortably. Extremely comfortable leather seats. Controls are easily accessible and lots of compartments for your stuff. The dash layout is very nice as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car was my first at 17 years old. It's a silver 2008 Nissan Altima coupe 2.5S with 2.5S convenience package. For those, who are looking for a decent car for decent money, buy this car. It looks epic on the outside and spectacular on the inside. I bought it because it comes with some things that the Toyota Solara doesn't. Drives well, very powerful for a 4-banger, 175 horsepower is definitely enough for a starter car. Has 6 standard airbags and great crash test ratings. Intelligent Key is outta this world. Radio puts out a good crisp and clear sound. CVT manual mode is a definitely blast for those looking a little something extra. Gas mileage is okay at 25-28 mpg. Great car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Outside aerodynamics, 6 speaker audio system works well with iPod, Bose is overkill and basically sounds the same, save the 3 grand. Rear seat legroom is okay depending on the front seat passenger. Intelligent Key. 2.5L engine. Very clear bright gauge cluster. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT> It looks like a mundane family hauler, but handles and drives like a sports car if you get on the gas. The 3.5 engine is so powerful, and the CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) is very smart and seems to read your mind. If you just cruise around town, the CVT keeps the engine revs low to save gas, but if you give it more throttle, it quickly lets the engine spin up (no shift lag) and it MOVES. When shifted "manually" the CVT shifts very quickly through the preset 6 speeds. Can feel bumps with the SE vs SL (luxury) version, but it's a reasonable trade-off for larger wheels, better shocks and stiffer anti-roll (sway) bars. Steering a bit numb, but sticks well in curves. I love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty handling. Engine torque. Well programmed CVT. Bose radio is strong, bluetooth is nice. Large interior and trunk space. Contrary to many other reviews, you can fold the rear seats into the trunk from the inside. There's a hidden button above the right rear seat for fold-down.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car drives wonderfully with great pickup. Around town driving got 20 mpg on the first two tanks and 21.8 on the third. Lots of well-designed storage space. The basic radio/cd player sounds great and picks up far-away stations. I love the fold-down back seats. Here's the however: My car's taillights leaked when I got the car. The sensor on the passenger side airbag turns the bag off sporadically when a 160-190 lb adult sits on that side. The dealer can't find the problem. There is no manual override to force the airbag to function, so my passengers are sometimes in danger. The "you've left your key in the car" alarm sounds when my key is in my pocket outside the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had the car for a month and look forward to driving it every time. 4 cylinder is surprisingly quick and quite zippy. Just tapping the accelerator makes the car want to dash right off the starting line. CVT is wonderful as well. Had an old automatic Mazda Protege and I could feel each and every gear change. Now, I just drive, smoothly too. Interior is roomy. I can fill each seat and all the passengers are comfy with enough leg room. A lot of compartments to store stuff. Glove box is cavernous. Doors give a nice solid thunk when closing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Intellikey system is great. Not having to fumble for keys is the best thing since sliced bread. Gas mileage is better than expected. Takes me about 2 1/2 weeks for the fuel to run to empty (about 125mi per week). The Alty's (2.5S) fuel tank takes about 510mi to go from F to E.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the 2.5SL Altima for three main reasons. Fuel economy, style and price. Those are the good things. I noticed a vibration in the front end, on the drive home, between 63 and 70 mph (approx 20 miles). Took it to a tire shop to check the balancing, that helped, but didn't solve it. I'm on my third trip to the Nissan shop. If this doesn't fix the problem, I will have to consider another vehicle. The vibration and what I would consider a hard ride, has soured me. I still like the style and fuel economy and would love to have the vibration issue fixed. I will check the tires for overinflation from the factory. That may improve the hard ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a Honda CRV in July 2007 and was very disappointed in the gas mileage (17 mpg). So in December 2007 I decided to try the Nissan Altima (2008). I was very surprised at the pickup that this car had for a 4 cyl. (the Honda had a 4 cyl. too but was not as peppy). So after spending a couple hours at the dealership working out the details, I drove out being the proud owner of a 2008 Nissan Altima 2.5 S. Right off the bat my mileage around town is 25 mpg. There aren't any sedans in this class that really come close to 25 mpg. I really love this car. It handles like a dream and is very sporty. I had owned 3 Maximas before buying the Honda and from now on, I'll only buy a Nissan.</TEXT>

First tank of gas the mileage was not that good, mainly because of my desire to get the know the power of those 270 horses. 2nd tank of gas resulted in average of 26mpg -- which was 75% highway and 25% city. I know I am sacrificing 4-5mpg for v6 instead of v4, but I can live with it. </TEXT>

Stepping down from a Trans Am WS6 5.7 liter engine to a 2.5, I didn't expect the Altima to have much power at all. Man, was I wrong this car is a joy to drive. It's very spirited with the CVT, but also can get great gas mileage. I've been averaging 30mpg, 40 on long trips. Handling is superb also, I live down a long back road with many curves and It's exhilarating navigating the turns. I love the exterior of the car, It's just gorgeous and stands out from the crowd.

<TEXT>I purchased the 2.5SL Sedan and was so excited. I previously owned a 1996 Maxima and loved it. The Altima had too many problems to list. The main issues were the CVT transmission, ride stability and the drivers seat. I had to practically floor the car to get it going from a stop or slow speed. I really thought there was something wrong with the CVT, but the dealership told me it was fine 3 times. The driver's seat shifted around when turning (very annoying) and the dealer said there was nothing wrong. On the highway, if there was a slight breeze, the car was dangerously all over the road, again...the dealer said there was nothing wrong. I traded it in on an Acura and I am very happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have now owned this vehicle for approximately 1 year and my experience has been fully satisfactory. I cannot think of a better sedan that offers this much power, style, great handling - all at a reasonable price! ENGINE: This vehicle handles like a V6 sedan, but uses gas like a 4CYL. It still surprises me that this 4CYL CVT engine can produce 175HP with powerful torque, and gets about 27MPG combined city highway driving - translates to about 530 miles to 20GAL tank (600MI all highway). HANDLING: When taking tight curves on the road, I have no fear to take them even faster, as the steering is responsive and accurate. >>> Extremely happy with my first purchase of any car! Highly recommended.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>ENGINE: Liquid smooth acceleration. Most powerful 4CYL in its class - supportive torque. HANDLING: The car goes where I want it to go and takes curves easily. INTERIOR: Plenty of space for 5 adults - Spacious trunk. AUDIO: Basic speakers have strong bass and clear sound. STYLE: Best I've seen!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I would love to say that everything about my car is rosy and great. However, Nissan for some inexplicable reason decided to install Continental tires on these cars (at least the ones sold here in Indianapolis), and the dang thing will chatter the teeth out of your head at 75mph plus. Other than that it's a superb car and I cannot wait until I have the cash to replace those tires with Michelins. In all honesty I love this car. It has great power for a 4banger and is very smooth (if you don't have a lead foot like me). The only other issue I've had is that it tends to sound a bit like a diesel when you start it cold. I'm told that this is perfectly normal...if not a bit annoying at times.</TEXT>

I *did* have the whistling mirror issue, which the dealership quickly resolved. Also, my passenger seat shakes at high speed if nobody is sitting in it, and that can be somewhat distracting.

I compared it to the accord which was Nice but it was pricy and only had a 5spd, and to the Camry which had the crapyest cluch feel of amy car ive ever driven, was difficult to hold to floor. I love the keyless everything, very convenient for me bc im a delivery driver and am in and out of my car hundreds of times a day, gas mileage varies widely, when lead- footing it around town I have gotten as low as 20 mpg (burn out at every stoplight driving) to an extreme 40 mpg highway (55-65 mph), my best is 700 miles to one tank of gas. Which holds 20 gal. The best in it's class</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Keyless entry/truck/ignition, steering wheel controls, sunroof is awesome, Powerful, accelerates just as fast or better than my 00 silverado x-cab 4x4 5.3L v8 (although truck has 4spd auto), breaks will give u whiplash if u throw them on and push down the clutch!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> I have a knocking / rattle when I step on the gas when the car is cold. I have had my car in and out of Nissan service about 10 times at this point. I finally got them to admit that the noise exists. They have changed the heat shield but the noise still occurs. Nissan is telling me that this is normal and there is no piston skirts on 2.5 engines</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a WRX because wanted a better highway cruiser. Nice car inside and out, but had a couple of issues. Windows roll down by themselves, once overnight during freezing rain. Nissan mechanics could not fix that problem. The other issue was the CVT. On wet pavement with a fast takeoff the transmission would stay at around 4000 RPM unless you backed off completely from the gas and waited a few seconds. Really liked the looks, couldn't live with the two problems. Traded Altima in on a VW. </TEXT>

<TEXT>A little over a year ago I bought yet another Altima. Going through college I had a '96 Altima. Wow, how they've changed. The new Altimas are really sporty, fun to drive and reliable. I have black leather seats and they weren't the most comfortable when I first purchased the car but after a year they are great. The four cylinder has plenty of power and this is coming from a person who drove a 4 Runner with a V8 engine for 3 years. All in all a great buy for the price!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 04 Spec V on this car. One of the most difficult, yet one of the best things I've ever done. The Spec V was a wonderful bang for the buck, and I have graduated to the next level of bang for the buck with my new Altima Coupe SE with Premium Package. Hands down, this is the best daily driver sport coupe on the market. Plenty of performance without sacrificing comfort. The Bose stereo is fantastic. Homelink and Bluetooth systems are absolutely wonderful. Plenty of punch with the VQ35DE motor paired with the Xtronic CVT. Takes a bit of getting used to coming from a 6 speed manual. The speed can sneak up on you very easily as the car accelerates effortlessly at any RPM.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Intellikey setup is INCREDIBLY convenient. Leave keys in the pocket and operate everything in the car. Bluetooth system has had the kinks worked out from earlier variations in the 06 Infiniti G models. Push button start is just sexy. So are the leather seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I find the interior to be rather cheap for a car of that price range. The dash looks cheap and the ride is not particularly smooth. I had a 15 year old Saab prior to this Nissan and it had less road noise and drove smoother than my new Nissan. Also every time I try to shift into second gear the manual transmission gives me trouble. Almost have to force it into second gear. Very disappointed in my purchase. Dealership not very helpful in fixing the problem. First and only Nissan I will ever own.</TEXT>

<TEXT>While I am very impressed w/ the quality of construction, I remain disappointed w/ the performance of the vehicle. The best mpg I have achieved is 30 mpg when I first bought the car, but this has decreased to around 25 mpg, even on highway driving. The most disturbing aspect of driving my Altima though is the jerky performance of the engine/variable speed transmission. In suburban driving the engine stumbles along until the speed of 40 mph is reached. I can only describe its performance as rough, depending on the rpm modulated by the transmission. When descending hills the transmissions gears down, rather than coast for increased fuel efficiency. My last purchase of a cvt.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I think the Altima is a good quality product and you get a lot of car for the money; however, I have some issues with it. Most importantly, the exterior of the car crinkles very easily (per auto body mechanic). I had a plastic empty shopping car 3 inches away from the car. It rolled into my car and made a ding. I hope I never get into an accident! I also had a problem with my TPMS light malfunctioning. Also, there is a terrible blind spot when you back up from parking spaces. My sister-in-law has the same problem with her Altima. It's either the back of the car is too high or it's the fact there isn't a good visual field from inside the car. not enough window. Very dangerous.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 8th Nissan. I have had Sentras, Maximas, 350z and my last car, Nissan Murano which I traded with this car and I regret it. I have had this car for over a year and most disappointing is the interior. Very poor quality and cheap materials. Have you seen the interior of Hyundais? Much better quality. I had the car in at the dealership several times to fix squeaking sound caused by moonroof. The dashboard squeaks on rough roads, the back part of headliner is coming apart and passenger seat belt rattles occasionally, tires are lousy on snow and so is the fat wiper blades. The exterior and performance and all the gadgets are great. I have the fully loaded version. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Since I bought this car in April and the sun was shining in upstate NY that day, how it would handle in the snow and ice was the last thing on my mind. Well, I found out. Not good going up or down hills and since I live in a valley, the only way to get to work is UP. I've had some scary times with it already. I'm in search of a really good gripping tires for the front. I fell in love with the car style (love the rear), the leather, the moon roof, etc. The keyless thing was supposed to be a selling point, but I wouldn't buy another one, I've walked away forgetting to shut the car off!

<TEXT>This is the worst car I have ever driven in the snow. I live in Vermont and I would trade for my Stratus any day. It is not front heavy and is bad in snow. The rear window defogger is insufficient in cold weather, the car creeks when it has ice on it. The rear lights get foggy, I already had one replaced. The car is fun to drive, as long as there is no snow. The CVT is amazing on the highway. Excellent for driving in the city. The dual exhaust looks great. Great brakes, four wheel disc. And the intelligence key is fantastic...except I never know where my keys are to unlock the house because I never need to take them out for my car! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I made the mistake of purchasing another Altima. I bought the 2.5 with SL Package Feb 08, and although the leather interior is one of the most comfortable I've ever owned, the other problems have made me regret my decision. I've had it serviced at the dealership for creaking and rattling noises in the driver's door at least 3 times. The 1st time, the service manager said that a squeak/rattle kit would fix the problem. It fixed 75% of the noises, but in 2 weeks, they had all returned. The next few times, the technician couldn't reproduce the problem therefore couldn't fix the problem. The driver's seat moves side to side even after the dealership "fixed" it too. I can't recommend this car! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in an Audi A6 2.7t for this car. After spending seven months and 9600 miles spinning the tires on dry pavement with traction control on, I figured it was going to snow soon. I traded it in for a 09 Impreza wrx. So far I think I made a good choice. The Nissan had a loose driver seat, the shifter was very notchy, the airbag light kept coming on, the cupholder door was broken, the brake pedal was starting to pulse. Sometimes the windows would roll down by themselves while the car was parked and unoccupied. It was a hassle not being able to open the trunk when the car was unlocked without the fob,which would always set off the panic horn while in my pocket. I will miss the HIDs and nav.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Good car, quick yet fuel efficient. So far not too fond with the workmanship, little things like the driver side mirror missing interior insulation/causing a whistling noise when driving at 50+mph. Driver side seat (power) loose. Spoke to service department and was told that it's a Nissan issue they have yet to figure out. Volume control on steering wheel activates the vehicles horn, must be very careful when using that feature. Unaligned hood fairly noticeable. Rear bench seat needs proper fastening (middle section is loose). Several issues with the braking system. Most recent that needs attention, squeak from rear brakes, in process of having fuel regulator replaced.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Test drove the Altima 3.5 SE on a whim one afternoon; two weeks later we own one! Fabulous handling and acceleration. Nimble, quick and agile - combines rack & pinion steering with 270 horses summoned by the incredibly responsive CVT! We put 300 miles on it in the first 24 hours we owned it just for pure fun. Drives like it's on rails, even in the rain. Too easy to look down, realize you're north of 80! We drive V6 cars (and a V8 truck) ranging from 185 to 235 hp but nothing has the jack-rabbit acceleration of 3.5 SE 270 horses.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Whooshing away at the light change. Feels like your driving a Porsche at $70K less! Braking has been good, too, on ours. Steering is tight and responsive. Driving this car is addicting. Looks like a sedate sedan / performs like a sports car. Makes commuting FUN!</FAVORITE>

The ride is smooth as silk, And the 3.5 V6 has plenty of pep. There was no drop down there from the Maxima. The CVT is terrific. It blows away others in its category for both looks and performance. We considered a Ford Fusion. But when we drove the Altima, we knew this was the car for us. Knowing that it is a Nissan and will last forever is extremely comforting. Heck, our Maxima had 160K miles on it and was still going strong. Do consider this car, or the 2009, if you are in the market.</TEXT>

I am not an aggressive driver, I accelerate slowly, computer shows that I'm getting 30-40 mpg but it's wrong all the time. It rides like there is no suspension at all, very stiff ride, noisy engine.

<TEXT>I will have to say this car is extremely smooth to drive. I have driven a few cars before but the acceleration on this vehicle just blows everything else out of the water (and I only got the 2.5S!). In fact, if I don't pay close attention, the majority of my drives are at 20 over the speed limit. If you want a beautiful, sporty car with the price tag of a mainstream car, this is most likely it. I got to say though, the back seats are really not comfortable. I've seen some reviews say the rear space being mediocre in comfort; I think that's an understatement. My roommate's children (both under 10) can barely fit but I guess the target demographic of this car was never for "family" passengers.</TEXT>

I put twenty thousand miles in the first year and my Altima still looks and performs as good as the first day I had it.

<TEXT>I researched the mid-size sedan market for months. The Accord, Camry, Fusion, Mazda 6, and Sonata. The Altima is a cut above the rest. The exterior design is beautiful, and the interior is sharp and crisp. I have 2 little boys both in car seats and they fit perfectly in the back seat without feeling cramped. Fuel economy is as advertised if not a tad better. I'm averaging 31MPG, mostly HWY but some city. I LOVE the CVT. Nissan did an incredible job with it. It's smooth and the manual option is a fun bonus when I feel like it. The ride is smooth and surprisingly quiet. Trunk is HUGE, only complaint there being the hinges. Plenty of cupholders including an adjustable one. 5 Stars!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car after doing tons of research for 3 months. I found a great deal and I have not been disappointed. This car is so fun to drive. The 6 spd manual is quick and sharp, and the power is endless. Mash the gas at 60 mph and watch the world turn blurry. Interior is spacious and comfortable, and the exterior styling turns heads, especially mine. I'm very happy with my purchase, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants the size of a sedan, the speed and handling of a sports car, and the technology of a BMW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. I think that the best way to describe just how great this car is to tell you what my dad said. He just bought the new Lexus sports car and he says that if he could do it all over again he would have gotten the 08 Altima Coupe because it drives almost as well and looks sharper on the outside, is more comfortable, and when you factor in that it is half the price it's a no brainer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased this car after considering Acura TL among the usual suspects in the same price range. I wish I had sprung for the extra 5000 dollars, as it seems like a bargain after five months of ownership. Nissan's interior quality is shameful to be generous.This car has more rattles than Mazda I traded in. Panel gaps and sagging interior pieces are too numerous to mention. It is very fast and reasonable handling/ride and provides good 24.5 miles per gallon. Nissan has now gone on my never will buy again list.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my 3.5SE for a little more than a year (nearly 20K miles) and I have to say that I love this car!! I tested the Camry SE and the Accord EX and this car blew both away. It's wonderfully powerful and quiet, gives a comfortable, tuned and composed ride for a sport trim vehicle. Handling is fantastic, very well balanced and easy to control. Mileage with a Yakima rack is OK at 23 mpg in mixed driving. Definitely recommend the use of at least mid grade gas, as regular sucks about 3-4mpg from the mileage. Legroom for a 6'3" guy like me is good, much better than Camry and Accord. Braking is OK, could be a little bit better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in an '02 Honda for this car and am so glad I did. I can't believe all the features that this car offers for just over $20k. I dislike the way Nissan lumps their options but the S model has everything I wanted without going overboard. I'm sure I will get a speeding ticket and this car has some power to only have 4cly. I have to keep the cruise set otherwise I find myself going 80 and don't even realize it. I researched the new Camry, Accord, and Malibu and this won hands down in my book. From safety to features, to the ride. It a family sedan with a sleek look that is so sexy! And you have to admit the push button start is so much fun.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, the new 2008 Altima is much larger, more stylish and much "different" car. The Altima's CVT is something to get very used to; not hearing the shifts or feeling when the car is shifting makes the car feel like it's constantly whining. However having that constant thrust of flowing power is also a positive. Personally, Nissan never lived up to the expectation of Toyota or Honda, but this Nissan (especially the coupe) may have Honda buyers look at Nissan. However, take one ride in a new 2008 Honda Accord, and you won't ever look back at Nissan. </TEXT>

<TEXT>3 months and 8,000 miles. I really love the car. Great sporty fun on the back roads; very long-legged and comfortable on the freeway. Originally looked at the manual, but read up on the CVT, tested it, and I love it: the powerful and smooth acceleration is hard to describe. Manual-mode is great fun too. A real head-turner. You don't see many coupes on the road, and I've had LOTS of compliments on it (mine's black). For the money, I don't know how you can beat the power, handling, and styling. For me this car is a good mix: a sporty "driver's car", but still comfortable and practical for the daily commute (especially the front-wheel drive for winter).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1) Overall power/performance. 2) Exterior styling. 3) Driver's seating comfort - the seat and steering wheel tilt/telescope give you unlimited options. 4) BlueTooth. 5) Keyless/pushbutton system. 6) Bose system/XM.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the 2.5S Altima in June. Two months and two thousand miles later I can report fuel mileage at 27 in mixed driving. The car says 29, but fill and calculate gives 2 mpg less every time. At least it is consistent. We have not had any major problems yet, but the trunk hinge spring now rattles and we can see that some of the paint job is not as good as we might have hoped. We are satisfied with the purchase and the car does come with features that should be standard everywhere like the keyless ignition.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Altima coupe in black with premium package is very sexy and pleasing to the eyes. High quality sport interior in black leather has a lot of class. The seats give plenty of support and are comfortable when in them for hours. Bose system sounds so crystal clear. Bluetooth works fantastic and sounds excellent. Moonroof is nice too. Great gas mileage and plenty of power with the CVT. Fun to drive. Great car for the money. Premium package worth every penny. I've owned over 30 cars and this is one of the nicest. I compare it to my 2003 BMW 330 convertible with sport package and I feel the Altima coupe is just as nice. Great car with all the features without being pretentious!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I shopped around for the past 8 months, trying to decide between the Camry SE V6, Accord EX V6, or the Altima 3.5 SE Sedan. I ran the numbers, test drove all three and made it a point to get opinions from owners of each of them. From all of my research, I finally purchased the Altima the other day and can say that I have made the right choice! This car is amazing, CVT is smooth as silk, engine has loads of power, interior quality is top notch and so far I am getting excellent gas mileage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Researched everything in its class. Liked the sports car handling of the Accords, luxurious and quiet ride of Camry, but the Altima was a combination of both. Biggest trunk for my work stuff, most comfortable driving position (armrests, steering wheel position awesome). Driver's legroom amazing. SL/Connection package great! CVT very odd but it works well. Pushbutton start is really cool. Only things need to be addressed are better rim/tire sizes. "T" rated 60 series tire gives great ride but mushy handling. Should come with "H" rating. Steering feedback is way to light, car wonders a little a speed. Trunk hinges are for cheap domestic cars not imports. I'm very picky and very happy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Pushbutton start, CVT good, overall driver comfort, gas mileage is what expected from sticker. Quiet, smooth ride. Overall looks inside and out. Would recommend to anybody so far.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2008 Nissan Altima in April 2008. It has been a great car thus far, fun to drive and handles well. I love the push button start the most, you can't be the opts for a 2.5 S. Previously, I owned a 2006 Altima but it was totaled in an accident. The new Altima improvements are noticeable and you would think they would be in a more expensive car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The ride is excellent. It's fun to drive, a much better vehicle against its competitors, however I'm doing 19 mpg in town, instead of 24. I've not been driving fast so I can get the best gas mileage. But overall is a great car. I have been enjoying it very much!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our Altima is the best accommodation of sportiness with practicality. The 3.5SE hugs the corners, and is fun to drive but you do feel every crack in the pavement. The CVT is cool. 270bhp is great and probably more than the car needs. The mileage is very good as long as you do not use the engine. Disciplined cruising at 65 with no silly sprints, this car delivers 30 mph (if you believe the on board computer), but at 75 it is closer to 26. On a recent trip from NJ to MA, we did 515 miles on 20 gallons. The trip computer said we got 27.1mpg, but a calculator says 25.75. The premium package offers bluetooth which we like a lot. The Bose stereo is excellent. The seats are OK. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Here in Canada the model is an SL. This car has outstanding fuel economy, I recently achieved 42mpg (imp. gal.)to and from work. This weekend we traveled through the Laurentian mountains and got 38mpg. This car is way better than a Camry and it's lousy shifting transmission, fit and finish the Altima beats it hands down. Anyone shopping for a midsize should put this car on the list, you'll be pleasantly surprised. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my altima for a few months now. It's comfortable and powerful. Averaging 28 mpg (30% city/70% highway) which is what I expected. The transmission is excellent though it takes a bit getting used to. The seats are comfortable and I can fit my 3 kids in the back (3 car seats). I compared it to other similar models and found it was more fun to drive than your camry, accord, fusion, sonata, etc. Between that, the looks, fuel economy and price, I found it was the perfect combination for my tastes. </TEXT>
