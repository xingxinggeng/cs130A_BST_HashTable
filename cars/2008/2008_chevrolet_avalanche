<TEXT>Bought the Avalanche to replace my Silverado. Couldn't be happier except I can't get my wife out of the Avalanche! Got the White Diamond package with 22" wheels. Took it to the car wash last week and when finished the young man asked for the owner and another customer said he wished it was his. Two of the young men wiping it down mentioned what a "sweet ride" I had. Drove from Utah to Texas and back fully loaded and averaged over 20 mpg at over 70 mph. Extremely comfortable ride on the open road! The folding steps are great! I'm over 6' tall and my wife is 5'; the adjustable pedals and memory seats make the truck a joy for both. Almost a year and a half and no visits to the shop.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav system, entertainment system, (grandkids love to ride with us), folding running boards, adjustable pedals and memory seats. Storage bins in the rear are very convenient. Tows like a dream. The backup camera and sensors are a must!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the ideal truck for business that includes taking clients to the field. It travels superbly, and gets better than 18 mpg if driven 65-70 mph. MPG drops quickly if over 70. The only complaint is its ground clearance, which has resulted in some scrapes to the wheel well corners; not noticeable, but it would be nice if it rode about 2" higher. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who can afford it, although its value to me has far exceeded the pick-ups I have had in the past. I will drive an Avalanche LTZ as long as GM can afford to make 'em.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2003 Dodge Ram QuadCab- Laramie edition, that I purchased new for a Chevy Avalanche LTZ, with Rocky Ridge customization package. I had visited several dealers in Hampton Roads, VA, and none had anything that met my needs. I found exactly what I wanted on eBay. My son and I drove over 400 miles Friday April 16, 2009 and traded in our old Dodge and bought the new Chevy Avalanche LTZ. The truck in white diamond (pearl white) with customization package makes it look just like the Escalade. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the Rocky Ridge customization package w/ 22" Incubus wheels! XM Satellite radio (Hair Nation, Boneyard, etc!), White Diamond paint with lt Cashmere int, safety features (side airbags, etc.), 87 octane, smooth ride (like a nice yacht), covered rear bed, side storage, turning radius is excellent</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am a lady that bought this as a surprise for my husband. I love it so much that I'm probably going to buy one for me next year. I love the rear assist camera, heated seats, and power retractable steps. I was a previous Camry owner and I've never owned an American car before. If this truck lasts for 10 years like my Toyotas, I'll never buy another foreign car again. I am super impressed with the Chevy Avalanche.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was t-boned on driver's side/other guy going about 50! Walked away from my 2007 Avalanche. Side bags saved my life, as did the vehicle. Avalanche was totaled, as was F250 diesel that hit me. Cops said Avalanche saved my life without question. Bought a new 2008 LTZ. Can't say enough about how great both have been. Not a problem on either one. Had a 2004 Deville and these trucks ride and perform as well as the Caddy. If class, quality, ride, safety, and good looks are important then this is your vehicle. I can't stress how great I feel with all the safety features built into this truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the smoothest, most comfortable, versatile truck in the world. I bought a new LT last year and dad and I made a trip up to WI., from Florida. He couldn't believe it was a pick up truck. It truly has a better ride than my wife's Cadillac. The storage is awesome and abundant and the cabin is as comfortable as sitting in a lazyboy in your living room. The only thing I don't like is that my wife likes it better than her new Caddy, so it looks like we will probably have 2 of them in the near future. You can really dress these trucks up too if you're in to that. Chevrolet never seems to advertise these trucks. If they knew what they were doing, they would put everyone else out of business.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the remote start on the cold mornings. The heat is on when you're ready to go and I can't say enough about the cabin comfort and the remarkable seating.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I chose the LS model for two reasons, first it was a few thousand dollars cheaper, and second, it had the 40/20/40 split bench, which I like better than the bucket seats that are the only option in the pricier LT and LTZ models. I really like this truck. It is a no-compromise crew cab (essentially, a Tahoe from the rear seats forward) that is easy to get into (I seldom even bother with the running boards, but then, I'm 6'3", my wife who is 5'2" uses the running boards and has no problems getting inside). The performance is excellent. Using the midgate, I can haul an object as big as a full sized couch with the rear seats down. I got 21.8 MPG on a recent road trip, hard to beat that!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine is strong and gets decent mileage, the ride is quiet and smooth, the seats are comfy on long rides, and the tailgate locks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've been eyeing an Avalanche for years now and finally bought one with the employee pricing in Sept '08. Interior is very impressive and the ride is suprisingly smooth for a truck. The climate control knobs could be easier to use when driving and a coin holder would be nice. Backing up is tough but the park assist helps a lot. Everyone who rides in the truck comments about how nice the ride is (even other truck owners). Gas mileage is almost exactly the same as the 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee 6cylinder we sold to buy this. We avg 15.5 mpg and could do better if we tried to use 4cyl mode more often. 4WD engagement is seamless.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For those who don't need a truck all the time, but need one occasionally the Avalanche is a perfect fit. It is built on a Suburban frame so it rides much more smoothly than a truck. The bed can be made into an 8 footer and makes a great bed for camping trips with the seats folded down. Very good build quality. GM makes good trucks and SUVs, my previous vehicle was a Tahoe.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a 2002 and traded it for an 07 Tundra. Big mistake! The ride quality and interior comfort can't compare! My 08 LTZ is awesome! Extremely comfortable! The remote start gets the truck just right before you climb in. I love that it has everything! Back-up camera is too cool! Averaging 17MPG overall which is 2 MPG better than my 02. I have averaged over 20 on highway trips! Bedmat keeps cargo where you put it, but makes some things hard to load/unload. Tows like a dream! 5.3 has plenty of what you need in a truck...power!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Can honestly say this is most comfortable truck I have ever driven. I have only ever owned Dodge and cross shopped this with the new crew-cab Ram. The Avalanche drives as well as the Ram even with its new coil rear suspension. The Avalanche interior is very sophisticated - more SUV than truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Best seats I have ever sat in. Auto 4wd is excellent in winter weather we have had. Very impressed with highway mileage - pushing 20-21 if I drive 60- 65mph. Weathertight bed has been great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wow. Can't say enough about this truck. Was considering the Tundra 4dr/4wd. But that would have cost about $5,000 more plus a cover. If you take my price and compare it to what I would have gotten if I'd gone Toyota, you'd be amazed. The Avalanche has a better interior and a better ride (not as stiff). The utility is also better as the seats can be folded or the cover stored. It may not be as fast as the Tundra, but if you are doing hwy miles, you should get this. I traded in a 1998 Toyota. I'm impressed. No problems yet. I also like the oil filter/drain set- up. Much better than the competitors if you do it yourself.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>08 LTZ</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>What is the Avalanche, a pick up truck, an SUV, a motorcycle hauler, a comfortable long range cruiser, a technical wonder? The answer is, all of the above. The Avalanche does so many tasks with ease. I load with people some times, or haul one of my motorcycles in the back or both. The LTZ with the auto leveling suspension handles that with grace. This is my second Avalanche as I had a 2002 when I was living in NH. Both have / were totally dependable with no issues what so ever. (to be expected from an American car, I know). The 08 with this advance handling and suspension is a dream to drive in very slippery conditions. Buy one you won't regret it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated windshield wiper fluid. Great sound Bose stereo with sub woofer. Heated seats come on in cold weather when you used the remote start. Two ways to navigate, OnStar and DVD, Midgate. Manners while towing. Very smooth cruise control. Rear side storage lockers. Everything! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well, it has been about a year since I bought this vehicle. I have even nicer things to say than when I had just acquired it. This is a very dependable, comfortable, powerful, luxurious SUV that also is a truck. And, you can write the whole thing off on your taxes because it is over 6,000 pounds and it is technically a truck! Buy American and feel good about it! Less costly than Toyota or others out there. Chevy will deal! I got the extended warranty but don't think I'll need to use it much; this is a very reliable vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Big, comfortable ride! This is a Cadillac with a Chevy badge. Excellent 4x4 will get you out of anything. Reliability. Beautiful appearance. Spacious for you and guests. Memory automatic features. Gigantic trunk! Rear cover keeps your stuff out of the rain and dust.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned several GMC crew and extended cabs and a Yukon but this Avalanche really does have it all. I have the Z71 package which I think gives it a little better look. The side locked storage is great as well as the looked tailgate with a water tight cargo area. Smooth as a nice car yet tough as a truck. Truly has it all. The more I learned about it after I bought it, the more I liked it. This Avalanche is like home to me, so comfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this truck--and yes, I'm a girl! I just bought my Avalanche after months of looking around and comparing other SUVs and trucks. Overall, I really liked the Avalanche's versatility as an SUV/truck combo. I must say, though, that Chevrolet's use of the White Diamond exterior paint is what put me over the top. This truck is absolutely gorgeous--the cashmere leather interior and the 20" chrome wheels & chrome accents really make this truck a showgirl! If you are looking to purchase an Avalanche, I suggest you spring for the LTZ package. You won't be sorry you did. All the extra features are really nice and make the whole driving experience enjoyable. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear-view camera & back-up assist feature, navigation system, Bose sound system, heated mirrors & wiper fluid, remote start. I love everything! I really love the fact that the bed is covered--and that it locks! That is so convenient. I also love the OnStar system and the hands-free phone feature</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Avalanche. Have had an 02 and 04. Bought an 07 Silverado and didn't like that at all. Only had around 9000 miles when I got rid of it. The Silverado got the worse gas mileage I have ever gotten with one, and have had them for years. So, was able to go back to the truck I love. It is so versitle. Can fit sheets of plywood and drywall in without issues at all. The storage areas are great as well. There is so much room that everyone can travel in comfort. Drove straight through to FL one year and put a futon mattress in the back/folded the seat down and the kids had all the room they needed along with all the luggage. Has to be the best product GM has come out with!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always been a Ford fan, and still have nothing bad to say, but this is the best vehicle I have ever owned. I love this truck. I looked at the F-150, Tundra and even the MB GL, but I was drawn back to this truck every time. It's functional, practical, has a very roomy and comfortable back seat, the plactic bed cover is more durable than the steel ones I have seen. I own a BMW and this truck's interior fit and finish is just as luxurious as my BMW's is. I have never been happier with a purchase, I'm averaging 15 MPG, not great, but not bad for a pickup. I had a lot of people point me towards the Tundra, I would not do an even swap if you paid me $10k more. I'm a bowtie guy now!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Locking side storage bins on the bed, locking tailgate, ease of converting to a full bed, back up camera, rear entertaiment system allows you to watch movies in the front when truck is in park, remote start keeps temp at 72 in winter and summer, side airbags, mesh grille, auto sunroof, takes E85 fuel</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2001 GMC Sierra 1500HD 4WD for this vehicle and I am very impressed. Chevy really did there homework. I got the 6.0L 4WD LTZ w/chrome pkg. (ie. loaded). It drives like a sedan with no problem getting into regular parking spaces. There was no way I could take my old truck where parking was a concern. It is quiet but with plenty of power. Extremely comfortable with a silky smooth ride. Midgate and side coolers are very functional. I did not have to buy an additional bedliner and fiberglass cap. No problem putting tall things in the back. This ride is smoother than my Corvette and much more refined than any other truck out there! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 07 Trailblazer SS for this vehicle. It rides far better and while it does not have the blazing fast speed of the SS, it does very well for a big truck and gets a lot better fuel economy than the SS did with it's LS2 Corvette motor. Still Adjusting the the size of it vs. the TrailBlazer, but overall am very happy with it. Got a great deal--almost 10,000 of the sticker and 0% financing to boot. I believe that I will be very happy with this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I thought long and hard before buying this vehicle. I compared it to the Cadillac EXT, Toyota Tundra Ltd, Ford F-150 King Ranch, Dodge TD, GMC 2500 Duramax TD w/ Allison6spd. In the end, all those other vehicles were just trucks. If what you really want is a truck, then buy the GMC or the Tundra, in my opinion. If what you want is really a very nice SUV with lots of bells & whistles that also doubles as a pickup truck, then the Avalanche is for you as it was for me. I have every toy you can get on this LTZ and I suggest you either get the LTZ or the LT3 w/Z71. No LTZ ride leveling on the LT3 though. No 4x4 in the Caddy available.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Midgate: no one else has this in a full-size pickup except the Cadillac EXT, which is the Avalanche LTZ w/ a slightly different body, no 4x4 & $10k more.

<TEXT>I traded a 2003 Chevrolet Avalanche for this 2008. I put 52,000 miles on my 2003 and only had to change the tires and one light bulb. The vehicle is great and I couldn't be more satisified with the new one. I was concerned about the low height of the front valance, but so far it has not been a problem. Also, I went from cloth seats to leather and was concerned about the change. However, I can't be happier especially when I turn on the heated seats in cold weather.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Turned in our Suburban on a lease return and bought an Avalance. Black with two tone platinum interior LTZ loaded. Love this truck. The LTZ has everything you could want. Incredible interior with leather and lots of room. The exterior has a great design and love the custom grill and 20" wheels. The unique design as far as the way the back bed folds down and the back window come out is really an engineering marvel. get lots of looks in this truck, the black with the chrome accents really sets this truck apart. Can not wait to add some custom features I have already found. I was able to negotiate a great deal as well and GM is offering some really great incentives. 50 mile 5 year warranty wow</TEXT>
