<TEXT>I drove my CRV up the Troodos Mountians in Cyprus with 4 adults with no problems. The engine was quiet and the brakes reassuring. It was comfortable and we were relaxed. Petrol consumption was good (this is the 2l engine). This Honda is about being relaxed and comfortable and I cannot fault it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this vehicle about 1.5 years ago. At first we liked it. It has a very comfortable car-like ride and is fun to drive. Only mechanical problem to date has been a failed battery, which Honda has a problem with. However, when winter came our opinion changed drastically. If you have to drive in winter conditions this vehicle can be downright dangerous. The tires have no grip at all and we felt like we were taking our lives in our hands driving it back and forth to work. My wife refused to drive it and took my Corolla! We are going to have to spend $1000.00 on new tires before somebody gets killed in this thing. The Honda dealer will do nothing about it. Also it sucks gas like a Hummer </TEXT>

<TEXT>The crv is a top car when you have all the boys toys installed, but the downside I have recently experienced on my less than 22months vehicle is that both my front Yokohama 245/45/19 inch tires had to be changed due to the service dept inspecting the tread and recording the tread at the limit of 1.6 mm. I find this disappointing given that I have done only 13,000 miles from new and no erratic driving. This is too costly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the glacier blue ex awd for 23,200 out the door (base price of a little over 22,000). The ride so far has be ok... Pretty smooth transmission. Getting around 23.3 mpg in mixed highway/city driving. I owned a 2004 accord 4 cyl before, which basically is the same engine. Yes, the engine is kind of small and I feel and hear it. When car is sitting idle the engine noise is louder than I'd expect for it to be, and when the AC is on, it's really loud.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Beware of Tires</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>First time Honda buyer. After 10,000 miles, tires need to be replaced. They were rotated as required. Rough riding vehicle. Hope new tires will correct. Tried working with Dealer and with Honda rep. Dealer will replace tires with Michelin tires (that's what should be on vehicle to start with). Cost to me approx $400. Hadn't planned on spending money on new vehicle the first year--at least not for tires. After reading lots of reviews, tires are a problem. Vehicle is good car for older women--too small for men to enjoy. Will let you know how new tires change the ride. Right now, I could not recommend this vehicle. I will probably trade after correcting Honda's tire problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We love Honda's and the CR-V is the best 4 cylinder 5 speed SUV. Almost everything about this vehicle is great. Overall MPG is 25 for mostly city driving. The ride is "car like" and I know it will last for years with proven reliability. You really do get what you pay for with Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned this car for almost a year and are very pleased with it. We shopped for the Rav4, Equinox, etc but the CRV came out ahead. On a long trip recently, which included a mountain pass, we got 33 mpg! It's cute, handles well and is great in the snow and on ice. On the down side, the tires that come with it are garbage and several people have had to replace them after only one year, including us. The folding rear seats are a VERY poor design. They wad up behind the front seats and give you almost no extra room. Honda designers should take some tips from Rav4 rear seats and have them fold once, and completely flat. Also, the hatchback, when opened, can drip muddy snow and rain.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very disappointed with the upholstery on my CR-V. This car is 16 months old and the seats look worse than my 2002 Odyssey. This material does not clean up and shows wear at an unacceptable level. I bought Honda because I expect 10 years before I trade, and in this case I may soon be trading- maybe not Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased my CR-V as a low mileage executive driven vehicle after much research. The vehicle is exhibiting an annoying vibration at speeds between 85 and 110 k/hr. Dealer in conj. with Honda unable to correct. Honda says that no defect exists although they have a name for the condition - harmonic tingle. Apparently many other CR-Vs have same problem. I tried a brand new 90 and it had the same problem. Honda says I have to live with the situation as there is no way to eliminate problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a research based consumer, and a pretty practical person. I had my 96 Civic for 12 years before selling to get this new car. I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase. I compared it to a Rav4, Subaru, and others like Volvo's and Audi's. I wanted a practical car, but also wanted something luxurious! I went for the EX- L w/ Nav, and love all the bells and whistles. Feels solid, luxurious, love being up high, 4wd, and all the extras. Zips around the city and easy to park, and comfortable with great gas mileage on longer drives. Love the storage and space of this vehicle, doesn't feel like a compact suv. It's the best choice in it's class, for SURE!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the black exterior and tan interior, very classy! Love all the extras. It's a smart car. I can tell it to turn on the a/c, and it will! :) Love the backup camera now that I'm getting used to it, and the Nav is much better than my TomTom. Can't say enough good things about my new car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got real tired of visiting gas stations with my Jeep Grand Cherokee and decided to try the 2008 Honda CR-V. Great handling and very fun to drive. I don't miss my Jeep one bit. Its a tiny SUV with lots of heart. Gas mileage has been as high as 28 mpg, but average has been 25 mpg, not great but acceptable. If you want better fuel economy buy a Hybrid something or a Civic. Interior is good quality, spacious, and comfortable. The rear storage compartment behind the rear passengers is divided in two sections by a removable upper shelf. This design leaves a lot to be desired and can be very annoying when trying to load a large object. Overall we have enjoyed this mini SUV and highly recommend it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive, great turning radius, has all the conveniences anyone would want. The designers thought of everything and made the SUV very user friendly. Interior is upscale with comfortable seating. Gas mileage for an SUV is good considering its has AWD. Smart exterior styling and a pleasure to own!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2000 95k+ Honda Civic, and decided to get something that was a bit more roomy. So far, the CR-V has lived up to its billing. Firstly, the acceleration is much better than expected. I've had a few brief moments of lagging response, but for a 4 cyl 166 hp engine, it's extremely peppy and responsive. Interior display & materials on the ex are beautiful (the reason why I chose the CR-V over the rav4). Unfortunately, after only 1,500 miles of driving, my alternator, battery, and fuse panel needed to be replaced. Not good, but I'm hopeful this is an isolated incident, and not indicative of future reliability. My mpg is respectable, averaging 23 with 50/50 city/highway. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first import purchase, and have only had this vehicle for two weeks. In this time of astronomical gas prices, we took a gamble in purchasing an SUV-type vehicle. We were hoping for better gas mileage like many other reviewers, but barely 20 mpg is all we get so far with this 4-cylinder rather under-powered cross-over. Handles well, but ride is rough. Hoping the Honda reputation stands true for our new CR-V as we keep our vehicles for the long haul.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the car in mid June. 2,185 miles so far. Driven in town gets 20-21 mpg, during a long highway trip 31-32 mpg, doing 65 mph w/cruise on. Car is well-built inside, except for the door handles which feel a bit cheap. Leather seats are comfortable. Very spacious and great visibility all around. There is just a bit of wind noise at 65 mph, which i was looking for after reading the reviews, but its really not that much. Inside ergonomics are great. Handles great, not stiff. A bit under powered if you're a more aggressive driver, but its plenty quick for highway passing. Very convenient with storage space and inside compartments. Outside looks great. That's just a personal opinion.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Took a hit and traded in our 2004 Pilot, unfortunate timing to trade a larger SUV. Love the CR-V so far. Just did a 1000 mile trip (avg 27 mpg), XM radio got lots of use. Smooth ride, plenty of room for the kids and all our stuff. Slower pickup taking a little getting used too, but still a very peppy ride. Very happy with our choice, had to look long and hard for our favorite Taffeta White. Wish the front seats extended farther out for more support under the legs. Floor mats could be better quality, already matting and shedding a bit. Wish the back windows went all the way down, we didn't realize this until after purchase. Overall great vehicle, plan to drive for a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After researching a small SUV for three months, I finally decided on the Honda CR-V-EX-L. I finalized the purchase today and am extremely pleased with it so far. I also test drove a Toyota RAV-4, which was my first choice. I've owned two camrys in the past and have always been pleased with Toyota's quality. However, I prefer the sleek, clean design of the CR-V's exterior. This is my first experience with a Honda and I am very pleased with my selection.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife's choice. I was looking for an Accord. She fell in love with this royal blue pearl model. Fantastic fit and finish, no defects on delivery. Not a head snapper, but adequate acceleration and surprising comfort, Typical solid Honda feel. Loaded with safety features and very nicely appointed. Great handling and stopping. Mileage is a little better than advertised, with 28 mpg on trips and 26 in town driving, We both love to drive it and it is a head turner. People asking all about it. Couldn't be more pleased! Well, maybe a little. The funky console/tray is kinda useless and would prefer a real console with storage, but this is really nit-picking!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first CR-V and we are very happy. The first fill up was an actual 27.3mpg, very impressive. I just filled up yesterday and got a actual 29.5mpg, this is not the computer mpg, this is actual per gallon to fill up. This is a solid suv and the only real items that I don't like are the wind and road noise, I believe it is a little excessive. Buy this suv before the Equinox or any other small suv. Subaru is the only other choice in this field and I did enough research to prove that.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have driven this vehicle about 15k in almost a year. Very functional for driving around town doing errands and the 20 mile commute to work. Drive slow and hwy gas mileage tops 34 mpg. City with easy accelerating tops about 29 mpg. Better than sticker says. Seats not very comfortable. Good visibility and very roomy. Seats fold down for ample space. Get a dark colored interior so you see less dirt. Seat fabric is difficult to remove dog hair - it sticks! Very reliable and quiet. Smooth driving. Would definitely buy another but maybe a fancier model. Never owned anything but a Honda! </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased this great car to mimic the utility of our huge Mercedes R350 without the high purchase price and to have a more maneuverable car for our around town. The CR-V is really, really fun to drive and has a very high quality feel to it. It is comfortable and quiet at all speeds. It's every bit as solid as the Mercedes vehicles we have been driving for last 15 years. The only negative is the gas mileage. Our overall mileage, which includes 550 miles of straight highway travel, is only 20.5 mpg. Our Mercedes RE350 (a much larger, much heavier and more powerful vehicle)has averaged exactly 20 mpg over the past 10,000 miles. It's hard to understand. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my EX-L after a thorough review of the competition. In fact, I was set on the new Forester 2009 until I saw this CR-V parked in the dealer's lot. I have had it for a week. I am extremely pleased with it. I had an Audi A4 beforehand. Now, with two small kids, I need something more practical. It is a great car: very refined on the inside, pretty on the outside. The ride is great, even if the engine can indeed appear to be a little weak when on the highway going uphill. But everything is relative: it is a fine ride even then, just not as powerful as it could be. The car is intelligently designed, lots of space in front and back and cargo, and all in all an excellent buy. </TEXT>

Just got back from a 2000 mile round trip from Oklahoma to Michigan, and the CR-V handled like a dream. Gas mileage was around 27 mpg overall. It was plenty roomy for my two dogs (in the back seat) and I and all our cargo for a week fit nicely in the storage area behind the back seat.

When the third generation was announced I was counting down the days until I could buy mine. It has yet to disappoint me. The little quirks were worked out from my first gen and I am so happy I sprung for the EX instead of the base model. I love the feel of driving it and everything.

This car is great for carpooling to school and the room in the back seat for the three kids is excellent. I haven't heard a single complaint about space. I have learned to drive differently to save on gas and I am careful with the acceleration because I am used to a V8. We gave up leather and saved $2000 which we rolled over into tuition! I don't regret that now and hopefully won't in a few years. Thoughtful design, kid friendly, easy to drive and our first Honda. All in all a good deal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ipod capability is fun and so is the volume controls on the steering wheel. Gas mileage is better than I thought. We love the cover in the hatch to keep valuables hidden. Going up to the EX model from the LX model gave us a lot of additional features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased our CR-V almost 2 weeks ago, and LOVE IT! We had a 1999 Expedition with almost 200,000 miles and it fit our needs really well, but with our oldest daughter getting her license and hardly ever being with us anymore we decided to downsize. We almost purchased the Accord we knew it fit our needs and was a solid car, but wasn't too thrilled about getting a car. Our salesperson asked if we looked at the CR-V and we thought it was too small but decided to look anyway. We were very surprised on how much space was inside our 3 long legged daughters fit nicely in the back (they are 5'8", 5'6" and 5'4"). We don't know how a long car trip will be, but know day trips will be just fine!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage, we are averaging between 27 and 29, about double what I was getting in my Expedition. Very comfortable, 3 of us went on a 4 hour road trip and we never got tired.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this little SUV! I was a little worried about getting an SUV. I drove a 99 Honda Prelude for over 9 years. It was so small and low to the ground, but I have had no problems adjusting to the CR-V! I love Hondas and I fell in love with the CR-V the moment I saw it. When my husband and I test drove it, that was it! It is so much fun to drive and it handles great! I wish the gas mileage was a little better, but hopefully it will improve, as I only have 175 miles on it! It is nice to use regular gas. My Prelude required premium! It's also nice having so much room! I can actually take people in my backseat!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had the car since mid April and already have over 3,000 miles on it. I took a Memorial Day trip from the New York Metro Area to Ocean City, MD. I was astonished that my car averaged over 30 mpg and I only used a little more than half a tank on the 260 mile drive down to Maryland. The entire trip used a tank and a half. I'm not your typical CR-V owner, if there is one. I am a 24 yr old male. I owned a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee before this car and couldn't keep up with the 14 mpg. Although I am early in my ownership I couldn't be happier with my choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned an EX-L CR-V for a few weeks and am very pleased with the car's performance. On my first tank of gas we averaged 28.6 mpg and on the second tank, 29.3, all mountain highway driving with the vehicle fully loaded with me, my wife, and plenty of luggage. The ride is smooth, and the acceleration and passing speed is more than adequate for passing and overall safety. We bought the "Borrego Beige" EX-L because we wanted the light camel colored interior. In addition, we also purchased the cloth floor mats, the all-weather rubber floor mats, and the rear cargo mat. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Continuous MPG feedback, cruise control, leather upholstery, XM radio and the dash mounted shift knob. Also like the sunroof that can tilt for fresh air and low wind noise. With 8 cup holders (4front, 4 rear) there is plenty of storage room for the coffee/soft drink folks. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This CR-V replaces a 2006 Scion, bought with fuel economy in mind. The Scion replaced a 95 Accord wagon which was wrecked and has been sorely missed ever since. The CR-V has everything the Scion didn't. Very nice ride, good seating comfort, low road and engine noise level at highway speeds, good cargo space even with the rear seats upright. I expected the CR-V's gas mileage to be a lot less than the Scion's 32 - 33 mpg on the highway at 65 mph, but the CR-V is delivering within 1 - 2 mpg of the Scion's best mileage. This is my 6th Honda built car in 24 years. Acura Legends and Accords. All were superb. I have only about 300 miles on it, but I expect this CR-V be the best of them all. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very good fuel economy, great handling, smooth automatic transition from FWD to AWD in snow and on the steep, gravel driveways around our ranch. Space for a half dozen feed sacks, some 8' boards, and a week's supply of groceries. We don't need the 15 mpg pickup for weekly 65 mile trips to town. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my 08 CR-V in 11/07, and have put 15,000 miles on it driving all over the country for work in the past six months. I've driven in the mountains, on the prairies, in ice, snow, floods - just about every weather condition. It handles beautifully everywhere. The only area I feel some pressure on the engine is on hilly highways. The ride is great, not too soft and not too stiff, and I am just thrilled with the MPG. I average 29-33 highway and 24-28 city in all kinds of weather. The build quality is very good, love the power features, love the exterior looks. I would like to have fog lights and a longer armrest, but that's about it! Great vehicle for a fantastic price. Get it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>With gas prices being so high, I thought my next car would have to be a hybrid until I drove the CR-V. Wonderful vehicle, we even splurged & bought the rear spoiler, fog lights & auto dimming mirror. I'm not normally a big freeway driver (I avoid it at all costs) but the CR-V handles so nicely it's just a shame to keep it on the side streets only. It's very roomy & has all the features that will spoil you. (I can't wait for winter so I can try the seat heaters!) My husband is 6' 1" and has plenty of room to ride in the front or the back seat. Very peppy & cute, it's a very nice ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I?m not the typical CR-V demographic. I am a bachelor who has owned some nice sport sedans and trucks. I bought the CR-V EX as an alternative to the expense of owning both a sedan and truck. I really like it. It?s like a mini-SUV with all the space I need and the utility for my outdoor excursions. It obviously lacks the acceleration of my old A4, but I love the trade-off of the well-engineered and trusty V-TEC engine. I get 30mpg hiway and 25+ mixed (nearly double my last truck). I have NO problem passing at highway speeds. Only thing I would do differently is get the EX-L, which has more upgrades than just leather ? like air vents for rear passengers, nicer console, better stereo...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car because my older VW was getting to be a pain to fix all the time. I figured I needed a 4x4 for the winter, and I needed the extra room as our civic is a little tight on long trips. This is my first CR-V and I love it. The drive is smoother, the interior is nice, and the fuel economy is up there. I read others who were complaining about things missing that I have on my EX-L. I have only driven the car 500 miles so far, but they've been flawless so far. I will be taking my annual trip to NC this summer which is around 2000 miles round trip. I look forward to it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my CR-V. I own a 2000 Chevrolet Tahoe but was looking for a smaller SUV with better gas mileage. After much research I narrowed my choices down to a Honda CR-V and a Saturn Vue. I really wanted to Hybrid Saturn Vue, but after discovering that they were few and far between and that Saturn was having problems with the hybrid battery, I chose the Honda CR-V. Needless to say, I am VERY happy I chose my Honda CR-V EX-L. My wife has had both a Honda Civic and two Accords, and I purchased a 2000 Honda CR-V for my daughter as a college graduation present, but this is my first Honda. I love the styling, ride, comfort and all of the extras that make the CR-V EX-L a "poor man's luxury SUV"</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 06 civic for the 08 CR-V. I am not thrilled with the city gas mileage. Highway is averaging around 28. I thought I would get around 30 overall! It does not have any get up and go like my civic had. The arm rests are too short and uncomfortable. There is not enough storage space that is useful, no place to put CD,s. The seats are kinda hard and not comfortable on the back. My daughter had rhinestones on her jeans and it left some snags in the seat material. That made me very upset. I have to admit I like the room in it, the overall style and it does ride well. It is fun to drive, just not the most comfortable. I wish they would have offered the Navi system in LX</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just love my CR-V. This is number two. Had 2000 and gave to daughter . (she wanted to "buy it" because it was my 8- yr old car. She knew it never missed an oil change and was not in Katrina). This one has more "suave style". Other was what I called a "kicky little thing". Fun to drive. This one does not handle quite as easily (me?). Is a bit bigger and still feels different. I did have the other one 8nyears. Does do ok though. 28+ gas mileage. Bought in mid Jan '08 have 3500 miles now with a 750 mile trip in there. I do combo suburban - city drive to work. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When the CR-V got redesigned in 2007, I wanted it. I finally got rid of my 12 yr. old gas guzzling V-8 Jeep and got my beautiful Glacier Blue 2008 CR-V EXL. I thought about a RAV4 but loved the fact that the EXL had everything I wanted standard (leather heated seats, moon roof) and the tire was not on the back. The back gate lifts up with one finger and there is plenty of room to haul things. I can't rave about the gas mileage in town because I drive in stop and go traffic to work, but on the highway I have gotten over 20+ miles per gallon. The stereo is amazing with the subwoofer and 6 CD changer--you can really blast your favorite music! The windshield wipers are so big and powerful.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has a fun to drive factor, especially around town and doing errands. After looking at costs/benefits, we went with a two wheel drive base vehicle given the standard traction control, and it performed very well in winter (replaced an AWD VW 4 motion vehicle, and the CR-V drives as well in snow). We replaced the ugly wheels for lighter alloys at tire store for $600). Gas mileage (spring) is currently around 33 mpg highway (63 - 65 mph) and a bit better on secondary roads with few stops (34 mpg) - in Michigan driving environment and conservative acceleration. We were getting a little worse mpg in winter, 30 +- mpg hwy range once engine warmed up on longer trips. Overall 27 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Honda, my Civic was almost perfect after 11 yrs.and I only got rid of it because it was getting hard to get in & out because it's low and I have a bad knee. CR-V has now joined our 2006 Saturn Vue in the garage. Tested the Tucson (zippy ride, ugly interior), Rav-4 (didn't like the wheel on the back & a few other things) wanted another Vue but the gas mileage is terrible on the new model,and then once I got in the CR-V, I was sold. For anyone with a purse,the gear shifter on the dash allows for a perfect spot on the floor in front. It rides like a car, is fun to drive,feels solid,has a beautiful paint job (the white is gorgeous) and is very comfortable. Hope to have it for years.</TEXT>

But then I hesitated and decided to enjoy the shopping process since I was going to be buying a new car. I looked at the Nissan briefly and then on to the Honda store. There I took a brief drive in the demo. That did it. That night I decided to give up my Subaru loyalty (they're great cars) and buy a Honda. I got the EX-L because I wanted the heated seats and leather upholstery. I had the store add the rain deflectors. This past weekend I took a 500-mile round trip to Maine and back. I got 29.4 mpg. I had a good experience in the trading process.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been driving a standard compact Ford Focus for seven years, so the CR-V is quite the improvement. I opted for a little upgrade with the moonroof, privacy glass, and AWD. Immediately after purchasing it I drove 250 miles through rural Utah. Had no problem accelerating, even going 75 on a steep incline, or passing. Also had no problem with the road noise that others mentioned, although I'm used to way more road noise. The mpg has been around 20 in the city and 25 on the highway, I expect it to increase as i break it in a bit more. Even with the underbite of a front bumper, I couldn't be happier with this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I generally enjoy this car. Comfortable and well put together. Pretty quiet with some wind noise @ 70. Engine generally quiet unless you need to push it, and down shift a couple of gears. Wish the transmission had paddle shifters like my wife's FIT. FIT is more fun to drive. Too frequently it shifts to 5th gear for mileage, when 4th would be a better selection. You cannot manually select 4th. Can hit the button on the shifter and go to 3rd, but that's it. For this engine/trans combo 4th would be really useful. Overall mileage is about 22.5 with 40/60 city highway.(actually liked the CVT arrangement on the ROGUE better) If I slow to 65 mph on the highway mileage gets much better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Airy, comfortable interior. Decent radio. Good storage space. Nice ride and pretty quiet overall. Backseat roomy and nicely adjustable. Seats non-tiring. Overall size is just right.

Still have the 93 and 02, Combined 270K with no major repairs. Loved this CR-V with first drive. Excellent visibility for short spouse.

<TEXT>I bought a 2008 CR-V to replace an aging (and thirsty) 2001 Ford Escape with a V6. My wife is the anti-Christ when it comes to car buying and shopping, and with this vehicle and a great dealer, she left after buying by saying "WOW!". While others have complained about the seats, we find them comfortable and the ride much nicer than that of any other SUV we tried. Many other SUVs were too "truck" like, and here in Seattle with small streets and cramped parking lots, the CR-V is a brilliant performer due to the size and visibility. I am loving this rig, and I have no complaints!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had this car for two weeks and have 750 miles on it so far. I love this car and am so happy with purchase. Test drove/considered Highlander (-gas mileage, price; + 3rd row); Rav4 (-ugly; +3rd row); Mazda5 (- bumpy sort of weird looking; +3rd row). Very pleased with decision, was cheaper than all three other options, very comfortable, fun to drive, roomy enough for me and three kids (despite no third row - even on recent 3 hour drive no complaints), so far avg 24 mpg with about 50/50 city/hwy driving, FEELS safe, easy to park and turn in tight spots. I bought base model no extras 20K out the door. I probably could have gone lower but my color was selling out everywhere.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1. MPG meter (although would prefer actual numbers to bar) including average per trip. 2. Miles to go on gas remaining - great feature 3. Aux port for iPod - and great stereo sound 4. Interior - not cheap, sophisticated look. 5. Comfort - smooth ride, comfortable seat. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have owned for three months and current mileage is 7000 mi. Have had 4 Accords and one Integra so am familiar with Honda quality/reliability. Recent 5800 mi trip averaged 30 mpg. One 180 mi freeway trip at 70 mph was 34 mpg.Gas mileage better than expected.I think it likes warm weather. Very comfortable & quiet ride.Lots of storage room.I wish the rear seats would fold flat though. Engine could use another 40 hp to provide more oomph above 90 km/hr. V6 option would be nice. This is the first SUV I have owned and am impressed with seating height,handling and ride.At 7000 mi, oil life shows only 50% used.I am used to 4000 mi intervals. Seems like a long way to me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Like the steering wheel mounted radio and Cruise controls, 6 disc cd player, hidden spare tire, rear door configuration, 17" wheels. The gas mileage has been good for this type of vehicle.

This is a wonderful well built SUV. Our 1st honda ever, and love it. The ride is firm but supple, the leather seats are beautiful and extremely comfortable, worth the upgrade.

<TEXT>I was looking for a fun AWD SUV that drives like a car. A used BMW X3 with navi and heated seats was my first choice, but I couldn't find one at a reasonable price. Plus I estimated insurance and gas to be expensive with this car. I considered the RDX but the fuel economy was horrible. So the CR-V was the best alternative. It drives like a car, has all the features I wanted, better fuel economy (but not great) and the new redesign was a huge improvement. I never would have considered this car if not for the redesign. The navi and leather package makes the car feel more luxurious. Everyone thought I was nuts for buying this car until I gave them a ride. This car will surprise people.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation, heated seats, back-up camera (after I got used to it), MP3 player, xm stereo, trunk shelf, quiet cabin, reclining back seats, fold up back seats, heated mirrors.

<TEXT>WOW..I am still blown away at what a wonderful vehicle we have purchased. My husband and I switched to the CR-V from a 98 Honda Accord 6 cylinder. Loved my old Honda but as most people who owned 6 cylinder from that year up until about 2002 , Honda dropped the ball on transmissions.When we started looking for a new car we wanted reliability but we also wanted a good looking car. I don't think I can say enough good about this ride. Love the inside , outside ,the handling and the comfort. Love the fact that the range indicator tells you how many more miles you can squeeze out before a fill up.I usually have buyers remorse after a car purchase but when I think of my new CR-V all I can do is smile. </TEXT>

<TEXT>As of now we have about 3500 miles on our CR-V and we are totally smitten with our purchase. We compared the Rav4, the small Jeeps and some others and figured we got the best value for the money with the EX model. Mileage is in the mid 20s hiway so far and we assume it will improve as the drivetrain loosens up a bit. It is mostly comfortable for drivers and passengers of all sizes, with plenty of leg- and headroom, and nice seats.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Did not like previous CRV models so thought about a Rav4. After a few trips with a friend, chose the CRV; inside feels more upscale and spacious and the area is bigger. My only addition is something only Ford seems to use now; keyless number pad on the door. Only complaint is gas mileage. I avg 22 mpg at best when I combine 50% short trips (2 to 5) and a 50% hwy trips (20 each way). Even when I drove 120 miles each way on a trip, I barely got 25mpg (is it my luggage rack or me?) My last car, a Toyota Avalon V6, averaged 22 and 27. As for complaints about accelerating on to hwys and or passing; even w/5 adults the car was quick. Maybe other reviewers had > 850 lbs in car (weight max).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system & satellite radio. Fun to driveI don't have to step up but higher then a car for good view. Good console, plenty of storage, like the cargo shelf, & heated leather seats.

<TEXT>I test drove a 2008 Xterra, a 2008 WRX, and a 2008 Wrangler. None of them compared to the comfort I felt inside of the CRV. Though not as powerful as the others, the interior design and over quality feel of the car made up for it. I have owned the CRV now for two weeks. Gas mileage is decent, but I thought it would be better. I am averaging 22.5 MPG with mixed city and highway miles. A lack of power if not an issue at all. 166HP is more than enough for highway passing. I am very impressed with the interior space and the quality of materials used. I havent driven it in the snow yet, but I did drive it in mild rain and it handled well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased the CRV last week after 3 months of research. It was a tough decision going from a large Pathfinder to a small SUV but we could not afford the gas anymore. Very happy with the whole dealership process, internet buying was easy and in 5 days they had my CRV. Love the quiet ride, the Nav w/touch screen is great, the voice activated controls are good, as long as you say things slowly. Still reading the book on all the extra features. Rear seats have more room than expected, and love having so much visibility of the other lanes around me when I drive. The Pathfinder was boxy and limited. Can't comment on the fuel economy yet, and still trying to find the FWD button!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Back-up camera is great, space is pretty accurate when shown on screen. The Nav has been easy to use so far, and the ride is quite and comfortable. So far no real pick up issues on the highway. The CD changer in the center console and the shift being on the front panel takes getting used to.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased this great car about a week ago. I do love it in all ways excpet one: fuel efficiency in the city is awful. I am saddened and shocked as I really expected a little better. I live in a hilly city with lots of stop and go. Mileage thus far has been a constant 14.4. Weather has been perfectly clear and have not had to utilize the 4wd yet. This mileage is worse that my 6cyl RX300Lexus (year 2000). In fact, I traded in a 1999 Mercedes E320 so I could get some fuel efficiency and the CR-V is worse than that car, too. Well, it is a great car to drive in the city and I am enjoying it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my CR-V in a snowstorm, picked it up in another snowstorm and have driven it through 4 snowstorms since. I am 150% pleased with purchase. I looked at the RAV-4, as well, but didnt like the handling and tire on the back of the Rav4. MPG is about 22.5 right now with mixed bumper to bumper city driving and highway driving in Chicago. Given that the AWD has been used frequently and the engine still isnt broken in, I expect this figure to go up. All total I have about 4-500 mi on it. Performance has been great for a 4cy, though it would be nice for more hp or a 6cy option. I had a 05 Accord 6cy prior to this, and I do miss the power, but I still love my CR-V.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Car-like handling, the AWD is excellent in snow, back is spacious with the seats folded up, the blue lighting on the console. The refined Honda quality and attention to detail honestly can't be beat. I will never go back to Ford or GM.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I decided to buy this car based on Edmunds editor and consumer reviews, track record, price, and purported high gas mileage. I was selecting between the Mazda CX-9 and the Nissan Murano, and the CR-V. Since I was replacing a Toyota Camry, I thought that the size of the CR-V would be fine. The price was lower than the other two and the gas mileage, I thought would be great in comparison to the other two vehicles. Even though I receive about 24 to 25.5 mpg on my commutes according to the car, I can still only seem to average about 300 miles or 20 mpg per tank. I drive mostly highway miles and the mileage range advertised is not for the AWD models</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife bought an LX AWD, and I ended up liking it so much, I traded in my Expedition (kids got older; didn't need all the space anymore) and got an LX AWD too. It is sturdy, reliable, solid, safe and quiet. It also has all the safety features of the highest end Honda (we like that about Hondas). I mostly drive in the city, jumping on and off the interstate on occasion, and I average about 22-23 mpg. On highway trips, I get 26-28 mpg. The best words to describe our Hondas are basic (in the best sense of the word) and solid. They have everything you need (including the AWD and ABS for snow/ice) without all the extra bells and whistles and related cost. Also, no worries and no problems. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned an 03 CRV EX, I bought the 08 model. Other than the turning radius which the CRV, and more stability with strong winds and rain, there's not much comparison. I loved my old CRV way better. First, the new CRV struggles with acceleration worse than the old one. The 6 cd changer is placed on the cup holders between the front seats and the cd holders look like old sandwich boxes. And this structure is permanently attached that if you drop something on its sides, makes for difficult cleaning. There is less head/leg room. Side mirror adjustments were moved. Trunk space is less. No picnic table. The tires gave at 30K miles. So loud too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm surprised in other comments that most people get much better gas mileage than I do. I get around 17 in town and 24 on the highway, and I don't drive that aggressively. At first I thought it was winter driving conditions, but it gets about the same in the summer as it does in the winter, regardless of the ethanol in the gas or the snow on the ground. I'm getting rid of it now that I'm moving to a southern state and will be doing a lot of in-town driving. It's an okay car and I do like it, but totally not worth the gas- guzzling aspect of it. One good thing I have to say is that I'm getting a better trade-in value than I had expected. At least other people think it's a great vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hard to judge built quality this early since my CRV is so new but so far not a single problem. The engine could use a little bit more power but no regrets. The fuel economy is decent for the type of vehicle and the big tank with an 87 octance is a relief. The interior is very comfortable and nicely put together. Before taking delivery I've noticed a scratch in the shift level indicator. The dealership will replace under warranty. Hard to judge exterior design. Is no Alfa Romeo but not bad.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the safety features. I was looking into more premium cars like Saab and Volvos for safety but after learning that the CRV share all these features at a lower price decided to save some money. The CRV feels like a premium car anyways. Nice stereo, AC, seats, NVH.</FAVORITE>

Seriously - we got this car knowing that I would miss automatic on/off headlights, knowing that it would be a little nosier than my previous car. There is just no one else who can deliver better designed and more attractive small SUV!

<TEXT> I chose CRV over its competition (including but not limited to RAV4) due to: 1. Exceptional handling - highly stable at high speeds, little/no body roll on curves and turnings. As a result, feels exceptionally great and fun to drive. 2. comfortable and stylish interior - Good dash features (digital fuel and mpg indicators), drop-down center console, elevated and adjustable rear seating with good legroom making long drives very comfortable. 3. Stylish exterior - looks great from all views. Spare tyre hidden underneath cargo. 4. Good resale value due to its high demand. My positive opinions have'nt changed after driving 3500 miles (under wide range of conditions). I get 21-22 mpg in city.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my CR-V EX about a month ago. I choose the EX because I wanted the sunroof, which was standard on the EX model. The car is fun to drive and I've been very pleased with my purchase. This SUV is very classy looking as well, just as sophisticated as the pricier SUVs. The interior is so roomy, you actually feel like you are in a much bigger vehicle. Nice sized cargo area & the rear seats easily fold up for extra storage. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Good value</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Searched and test drove many small SUVs, Acura RDX, Toyota RAV, Subaru Outback and Ford Edge. Honda as always provides the best overall value for the money. Yes, it is not a powerhouse but it does have enough power for most situations. The benefit is good gas mileage and the power issue is only evident in some situations. The fact is that if you know the car you can easily manipulate the power to suit your needs in those situations with the gas pedal. Hill climbing is impressive and the grade- logic design does eliminate gear hunting so I think the Edmund reviewer was a little harsh with the comment in their review. Car is put together well and quality material is used everywhere. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Look and overall size, more room than you think. Leather option in the EX-L wraps the gear shift and steering wheel in high quality leather offering a great feel. Driving dynamics are great for a SUV - car feels sure footed and is easy to handle in all situations. Sound system is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Coming from a larger SUV like the Expedition, I wasn't sure how I would like the smaller SUV. It has room, comfortable ride, not noisey,very smooth on the road and highway, does great on gas, average 24-26mpg, the Expedition used to average 12mpg, so I'm very happy with the price of gas buying the CRV. I test drove the Escape, Rav4, Edge, Outlook, and a few other crossovers, and I liked the CRV the most. Other vehicles compared to the CRV were $3000.00-4000.00 more, and the Honda CRV had more to offer for the money. My wife owns a 05 Acord, and never had any problems. The 05 Expedition was always giving me problems, I'm done with Ford, and a happy Honda custmour for life!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The decision was between a Highlander or a CRV. The CRV won. Very pleased with this car. Wife loves the entire package - her "favorite" car. Overall mpg from dashboard indicator is 22.3. But, if you divide the miles by gallons put in the tank, it's about 1 mpg less. Still not bad for a small SUV. Dual climate control is not very dual - there is only one temperature sensor. I had to add an aftermarket Homelink rearview mirror with compass and autodimming - should be included in EX- L.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We are of a small family living in Houston and only have a BMW 325 sedan, which has limited carrying capacity (and not ideal for shopping at The Home Depot). We thus need something that can carry a lot of cargo, is easy to drive in an urban environment with reasonable gas mileage. We have tested drove both the RAV4 and the CR-V. We found that the design of the CR-V is very thoughtful for small families and for woman drivers. Thus far, we believe that we have made the right decision. Many people go with the RAV4 b/c of the V6 power but review from this web site has shown that the V6 produces too much power for such a small car to be stable at high speed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The CR-V is a great vehicle! I've driven about 1000 miles (good mix of highway and city) and the gas mileage is the best part thus far (low/mid 20s for city; upper 20s to low 30s highway). A good portion of my driving has been in snow/ice and the car handles great-I literally had to force the vehicle to lose control. I've seen many complaints about power, but there isn't lack of power (reminder: it's not a dragster!). The CR-V is extremely quiet as both engine and road noise are low. Even a 30+ mph wind didn't add much noise in the cabin. The rear cargo area wasn't as big as I thought, but it works for my needs. Lots of small storage places to put stuff, but some are a bit too small.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It is a decent little SUV, flexible enough to haul some medium packages and still fun to drive. Acceleration onto Interstates is a little noisy but adequate. Cruising is a breeze and MPG was OK at 27 for a 2000 mile trip right off the lot. Coming out of a Lexus, the ride was a little "stiff" but vehicle tracked well and cruises along at 80 or so with no problem. I would expect more from Honda - compared to the larger Hyundai Sante Fe Limited, it didn't come close to the standard features, but definitely did in price. The sticker is pretty much what they want/get. Why did I get it, because my wife liked it - enough said. Given the competition would I do it again - probably not.</TEXT>

<TEXT>While this is a pretty neat auto the road noise will take away many points. We traded a 2004 Ford Explorer on this car mainly because of the horrible road noise we got with the Ford. We have a neat new auto with almost the same tee same level of noise. We did not notice on the 2 test drives as both days were extremely windy. The dealer now tells me that there is no insulation on this vehicle as it is considered in the Civic family. We were told that the top end Accord and Oddessy would have insulation and be much quieter. Great! The fuel economy is not that great for a 4 cylinder either.</TEXT>

My mpg hasn't been the best so far (avg of 18-19), but I've literally only driven in stop and go city traffic, so I have patience. Also, the center "shelf" leaves some room for improvement.

<TEXT>Purchased top of the line CRV EX-L. My wife loves this car! Fairly comfortable and easy to navigate around town. The dual-zone climate control is very poor. If the outside temperature is 3 - 10 degrees cooler than required setting the system constantly flips between cold or hot air. Can't quite seem to find a balance. Rear seat passengers complain about the temperature when set to automatic. Not easy to control manually either. Had to move up to the EX-L to get comfortable seats. The leather seats are comfortable and make a big difference. Dash is tasteful and controls well placed. Price is high for the features on the car.

<TEXT>2008 Cr-v is a great car. For the money I paid for it, I got much more than I have expected. People say the engine in the Cr-v is not powerful enough - thats simply not true. I find this car to have more than enough power for whatever my needs might be. Besides, it is fast, quiet, has virtually no blind spots, and handles really nice. Plus, it is hard to find an SUV in this price range that looks so good both inside and outside.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I previously drove a 2004 Honda EX CR-V on a lease, which I turned in about four months ago. I purchased the 2008 EX CR-V about four weeks ago and absolutely love it. It is so much better than my previous SUV in comfort, ergonomics, technology, and overall style. I am averaging approximately 24 MPG, in mixed city/highway driving. My 04 CR-V was a pleasure to drive, but this total redesign really blows it away. The safety features are terrific with full side curtain and seat side airbags. With included traction control and vehicle stability assist, I feel so much safer driving this completely redesigned version. The CR-V handles nimbly, rides smoothly, and is much quieter than my 2004 CR-V.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I debated between the CRV and Rav4. I decided in the end that the CRV cost less to buy fully loaded. I bought the AWD leather version and added fog lights, running boards and side molding. I like the interior of the CRV but should have test driven it on the highway a little more before buying. The wind noise above 50 mph is pretty annoying and it's not the smoothest ride in the world! Also, after 700 miles, still averaging only 23 MPG with 80% of that highway miles. Not acceptable. I feel like I could have bought a more powerful V6 and gotten the same type of mileage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have recently purchased the CRV EX. I have an Accord and an Odyssey. I was very surprised at the interior room. It looks smaller from the outside than the inside. I've driven it on dry and wet roads and it handles great on both. I had read some reviews about the 4 cylinder not having enough power but found it to have more than ample power to leave most people sitting at stop lights. The interior design is good, especially the center table that folds down. It is annoying to get in a car and have nowhere to put my purse and stuff. I would have liked to have gotten the EX-L instead of the EX for the leather but would have lost this feature for a console. Basically, I love this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was searching for a 2007 Honda or Toyota as replacement to my Volvo 850 since June in anticipation of expensive repairs. After a few twists and turns settled on a 2008 CR-V. I have driven less than 600 miles, my impressions are: Rear styling is similar to my Volvo 850 and its side profile is growing on me. The glacier blue looks good in many different lightings. Curve handling is surprisingly good, the bright headlights make me feel safe with night time driving. Seat is reasonably supportive for hours of driving. Everything feels solid and no rattling. Road and wind noises are minimal especially with audio on. Easy ingress and ingress. A viable alternative to a luxury wagon.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Allows internal access to rear without exiting. Fuel/ trip monitor to maximize MPG efficiency. Spacious and low clearance to lift heavy items into the car. Cruise control on steering wheel, wider tires to improve handling. Top rated safety features as standard equipments. Reliable and less costly.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>MPG depends. Oregon uses 10% ethanol. Hwy=26-28. In non ethanol states Hwy=29-31 (moderate hills and 70 mph). My combined average after 3,000 is 25mpg with 70/30 mix. No race car but smooth and responsive. Visibility is actually good (I wondered). I'm a single man who is very active. It works great: surfboards on top, bikes fit inside, etc. There is really a lot of room for the MPG. For those who think it is too female, get over yourselves - it is a car that does what you want. I was looking for wagon but US has few / SUV's are too big and inefficient (and many have no inside room). The Subaru is better AWD but smaller with same MPG and this was over $1000 less. Works for me. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling is sporty. Very comfortable including seats (firm but support is good over a longer trip). Was a good value compared to competition. Quiet if road isn't rough. Versatile for active lifestyle. Flat floors. Visibility is good. Sunroof works well (no buffeting). Many small thoughtful touches.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This has got to be the best Honda that we've ever owned. The mileage is fantastic for an SUV-type vehicle and the space is great. The mileage compares to our old Honda Accord. Our new CRV is fun to drive and we love taking it out on the highway where it gives us about 32 mpg. We average about 25 mpg in town. Can't say enough about the great gas mileage and the fun it is to drive. Best economical car we've ever owned. Like it almost as much as our Mercedes 560SL ... almost. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have 90 mile daily commute, good mpg required, thus had to pass on any V6 SUV's. CR-V won't thrill with acceleration, but I routinely have 4 adults, a baby, and a load of Costco purchases aboard, and it handles hills and merges just fine. Nimble handling, good sight lines, excellent brakes. 2008 had several crazy snowstorms in Pacific NW. CR-V AWD handled quite well, although the stock Bridgestone tires not the greatest and at 32k are almost spent. Nary a squeak or rattle, except for a whistling sound from the A/C every so often. Rogue was a close second, having Bluetooth, Xenon, Bose, but also fixed rear seat and headrests, and a little less solid feeling. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my CR-V for about 6 months now. In general, it's a very nice car to drive, has decent handling, good mpg for a small SUV, and is very nicely designed. The power is rather lacking, but it's only a 4 cylinder, and I find myself continuously frustrated that it is only sold as an automatic. However, the general reliability, safety, performance, and resale value of CR-Vs made this my first choice because of the arrival of our new baby. If no baby, I would never have purchased this vehicle simply due to personal taste... I'm a truck person. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Sold a '99 CRV when the 2008 came with power driver's seat. It comes with so much more: Heated seats, tilt & telescope steering, dual a/c, TPMS, service calculation for oil change, etc. Wish it had auto headlights and auto rear view mirror. Nevertheless, this is one terrific vehicle, especially at the price of $25,000 for the EX-L. We tested all the best and the CRV was just a clear winner. My wife has subsequently bought the runner up for herself- the Nissan Rogue SL because it now comes with leather on the FWD, which was not avail. in 2008.</TEXT>

This CUV is built vault-like solid, from solid door closures to 1st class switchgear w/ great tactile feel. CRV has the nicest interior between the Forester & Rav 4 (by far). Dual temp controls work great & is fantastic when my husband is riding along. Gas mileage is lower than expected avg 22mpg. Only complaint is you feel all road imperfections. </TEXT>

It is somewhat bumpy at times on rough pavement, but it is dependable and I love the style of the exterior and interior. Also, the safety ratings are great. I live in Ohio and the weather is not great and it has handled very well in the rain and snow. I would definitely recommend this car to anyone looking for a compact SUV or a new car period.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned this vehicle for a short period of time. I was impressed for what it is, but finally came to terms with what it isn't. It IS a thoughtful design that is very practical and reliable. It was NOT a bachelor car. And I'm a bachelor. Almost every other CR-V driver I saw was a middle-aged or elderly lady. I got odd comments and reactions when picking up a date - none of the ego stroking I have gotten from even moderately priced sport sedans. Found myself constantly sinking money into accessories to make it into something it wasn't. After 7 months I traded it for a Bimmer. With mild redesign, CR-V could appeal to a broader demographic, but apparently Honda is not concerned about it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the CR-V because I wanted a safe, reliable, comfortable, small station wagon with good ground clearance, and a road insulating suspension. We have in Ottawa Canada the worst weather and truck beaten paved roads of any sizable city in North America. I go to the country and national parks and lakes in our beautiful part of the world. In the summer and in the winter ice and snow. The CR-V is a fabulous car, but the ride is horrible over the abundant and ever enduring uneven pavement. My Toyota Camry, and even my crappy Mustang were way better at cruising the rough roads. I'm not sure what Honda was trying to accomplish with this vehicle, but they failed to provide a pleasant ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first SUV (well, mini-SUV). I was contemplating buying between either the RAV4 or Honda CRV. Glad I bought the latter. The interior of this car is much nicer than RAV4. The spare tire is mounted internally under the trunk and not behind the trunk door (which looks ugly). Love the dash computer which tells you the mpg in real-time. I have driven the car about 400 miles. So far, I am averaging 27-28 mpg in the city. The only thing I do not like so far is there is a shudder/vibration upon applying the brakes. It was particularly bad the first day... it has gotten much better now. Maybe, it was just new brakes. The CD/AM-FM player is easy to reach and very good audio quality. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning a 2002 CRV for over 5 problem-free years (and reselling it for 55% of its original value), we decided to go for a new CRV. One year later we're very glad we did so. This car shines due to its dependability (absolutely no problems experienced) and the sheer thoughtfulness that went into its design and construction. Whatever aspect you look at, steering, seating, handling, this car performs diligently whether in-city, or on mountain tracks. There are faster, flashier and more powerful SUVs out there, but I don't know of any other that gives you the great peace of mind that comes with CRV combined with the pleasure of driving such a well-designed and thought-through vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This has been the best vehicle I've had. It's balanced in every sense - not too much of anything. The comfort, performance, styling and utility are just right for a small family. Even with a base LX we have just what is needed to be safe and still keep up with the times. The vehicle exudes solidity, and after a year, nothing rattles. Cruising at 70 mph all day is effortless due to the efficient gearing. Puttering around town is no chore at all. Cargo capacity is commodious, and most importantly, ALL the seats are comfortable. Materials are top notch inside and outside and EVERYTHING, inside outside and underneath is seemingly durable and well engineered. Very good braking and handling too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The rear seat backs are high enough for good support unlike some small SUVs. Rear flat floor is great for the middle rear passenger.

Very comfortable even after a 15.5 hour, straight through drive from McAllen, TX, to Albuquerque, NM. Averages between 21 and 23 mpg in town and as much as 31.5 mpg on the road.

The fit and finish of the vehicle are superior to the RAV 4. The riding comfort is much better than the RAV4 and ride is very smooth. I am extremely pleased with the rear hatch opening on the top rather than on the side and front seats seem to have more room front and back as well as side to side.

Although rougher than a sedan, the ride is decent and the gas mileage has been good (23 mpg in town). The navigation leaves a lot to be desired. It comes up with the worst routings! The voice recognition is more pain than gain. However, the built in back up camera is helpful. Interior is comfortable a good quality. This is the fully loaded model, so I expected a few more bells and whistles (lighted vanity mirrors, automatic headlights, automatic day/night mirrors) but most of what is has works well and is well thought out.</TEXT>

Everybody I spoke with told me that they love their Hondas and that's all they will ever buy again. I know what they mean now. I have only owned it for a month now but the ride is so smooth. When your at a stop sign you think the car turned off because it is so quiet. I just started to use the wipers and that took me a few tries to figure them out. Backing up is a little difficult though. I have to lift my head a bit higher and move more towards the center of the car to see the back window.

<TEXT>I was pleasantly surprised with the CR-V. I have been dying for the Nissan Murano, but at $11,000 more for almost identical features, I had to reconsider. I also considered the Honda Civic and Accord, and the Civic actually had a more high tech interior. Overall, though for the money, I got most everything I wanted, without a lot of hassle in different packages. They had the one I wanted at the dealer and I drove it home. I couldn't say the same for the Murano - as they wanted to add AFTER market stuff.

Don't be fooled by competitor's 6 cyl models, this 4 cyl has plenty of power. Handled road trips on hilly interstate highway without annoying tranny downshifts. Gas mileage is 30 mpg on freeway if you stay around 70 mph. In town it's around 22-23 mpg. Back up camera is GREAT! Really miss it when I drive my wife's car or a rental. Audio system excellent.

<TEXT>I traded an '08 Kia Sorento for my CR- V and couldn't be happier. The build quality is in a class of it' own and this vehicle has a very well thought design. I've owned a Honda in the past and my main complaint with my '04 Accord was road noise, and they've made great improvements with that. On my first tank the CR-V averaged 24.9 mpg (combined city/hwy). There's plenty of room for people and cargo and I like how the back sits flip forward. The back lift gate is easy to close, which was a problem with the Sorento, which had a very heavy/cumbersome litigate. Love how wide the doors open!

<TEXT>We compared the CRV LX AWD to the Toyota Rav4 Base 4 cylinder 4x4. We got a much better deal on the Cr-v, and it was the better choice. The interior of the CR-V is designed much better than the Rav4, and the ride of the CR-V is quieter, and much smoother. On the Highway we have been averaging 32.5 MPG. We haven't used the AWD yet but looking forward to the CR-V pulling us through the snow. The dash board controls are user friendly. The CR-V lets you know how many miles you have left before filling up which the Rav4 Base did not have. For a four cylinder engine you can not go wrong with this vehicle. If you can do without the sunroof, and other options the LX model has the same engine and body.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I can not just name one thing great about our CR-V, great mileage, the look, it's very roomy, great pick up for a 4 cylinder. I would pick the CR-V over the Rav4 Base 4x4.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I came from a (bought used CPO in 2004) 2002 V6 Eddie Bauer Edition Ford Explorer. Loved that car, but it broke down 3 times in 3 months and with gas @ $3.99, so I decided to try something smaller. I got the fully loaded CR-V, including Nav 5/26/2008. Car rides great, but idles kinda rough. Honda MPG: 22/26. I have no problems getting 28-29 with cruise control on the hwy. Front and side visibility is excellent, but rear quarters are poor, especially with rear passengers. HVAC heat and cool perfectly, and rear passengers can feel it. Nav works great, but the voice controls have like a 25% hit rate, despite having all windows closed, HVAC off and saying the exact command name.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased 2008 CR-V in the month of May. We are very disappointed with the quality. It vibrates a lot and we can feel it in the steering wheel and seats. As soon the drive stick is put in drive position the whole cabin starts to vibrate. Also, while driving it drifts towards one side. Dealer had taken the vehicle four times for repair but there is no improvement. Filed case with Honda too but they never responded. Honda is known for quality but at least we can't say that after this purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>15,000 miles and hasn't needed any warranty work whatsoever! Terrific drive and very comfortable; decent visibility helped by height off ground. Enough oomph to not be frustrating. Up to 34 MPG at 55 - 60 MPH. In town I can average as low as 22 MPG when it involves very short trips (1 - 2 miles at a time) and you would think 25 MPG would be more the norm. However, when my in-town driving goes over 3 - 5 miles at a time, my average does go up to between. Too bad Honda does offer this wonderful car with a manual transmission. I test drove the Toyota RAV4, Subaru Forester and Mitsubishi Outlander. Honda is more comfortable and maintenance-free car.</TEXT>

It's got a peppy engine, great handling, cool styling, and all the bells and whistles we could ask for. The only extra we needed was a roof rack, because this baby comes fully loaded, standard. It climbs well in the foothills (haven't taken it for a spin further up yet) and accelerates smoothly on the highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased our EX-L with Nav in Whistler Silver. Got it for $500 over invoice with 1.9% financing. The dealer had several on the lot and didn't even balk at my offer. Even had them throw in a couple of chrome CR-V license plates to boot. I've owned several Hondas over the years, and there is NO better car for the money. Fantastic interior, great exterior styling, and Honda reliability. The CR-V is hands down the best value for the money. Looked at a RAV4, and it wasn't even close. The interior wasn't near as nice, and I hate the spare tire on the back.</TEXT>

When we went to buy a Honda, we had our heart set on a Pilot until we walked into the show room and looked at a CR-V on the floor. We were amazingly surprised at what we saw. Great comfort, styling and looks. After the test drive we were sold. Absolutely love it and cannot find one thing that we don't like. It is our first Honda in a long time and we were very pleasantly surprised. IF you are thinking of it [CR-V vs anything else] you cannot go wrong with the CR-V. Fantastic car for the money.

<TEXT>I drove all the small SUVs before buying the CR-V. RAV4 handled like an old school bus. Rogue is nice but has the cargo capacity of a sub-compact. Subaru is nice but had dated technology. Mileage on the CR-V is very good for AWD, 22/27 after break-in and I have gotten nearly 30 mpg on flat highway. There is sufficient power for typical maneuvers and auto is smoothest I have experienced. Very solid build quality though I've had a few rattles come and go.

<TEXT>I have had my new CR-V for about a month. Overall, I am fairly satisfied with it. However, in the first week of ownership, I developed a "tire shimmy" which could not be corrected by rebalancing the tires. Therefore, the dealer had to switch out the tires from Bridgestones to Continentals. And, it solved the problem. The service manager also found 4 more CR-Vs on his lot with the same problem. New buyers should be aware of this potential problem. I also pulled out those marginal floor mats and replaced them with indoor/outdoor carpet runners with rubber backing from Home Depot. I cut the strip into 4 pieces to full size thus protecting all of the base carpet Cheap, but very effective.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an all around great car. There are a few things missing that really surprised me coming from Honda. First the fuel economy around town is between 15 and 16 MPG rated 22 mpg. The car is driven mainly by my wife albeit on short trips but nothing exceptionally dramatic. The highway mileage is right on the rating, 25 mpg to 30 mpg. The lack of a center console and just a shelf is annoying. The arm rest on the front seats, useless, way to small. The telescoping and adjustable steering wheel no help for a long legged person trying to enter when the wife leaves the seat forward. The sun visors are to short turned to the side windows. I would recommend the car all in all a great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2008 2WD EX-L This is a very nice vehicle - my first SUV. We were looking at the RAV4 and the Nissan Rogue as well, but went with this. Got it for $2200 below sticker price. No regrets so far. I have driven it for a week now (330 miles) - 1st tank of gas averaged 26.2 mpg. About 2/3 of it was in the city and 1/3 on the highway. Pretty good considering the car isn't even broken in yet. The acceleration is a little lacking on an uphill ramp & a bit noisy but does not bother me too much. The 270 watt stereo is awesome! Moonroof and leather are great, the seats are quite comfortable contrary to what some others have mentioned, but I agree the lumbar support is not very hard.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the best all around small SUV on the market. Toyota gets close but has that ridiculous door on the back. All the others just don't match up in refinement and/or gas mileage. We drive 50 miles to work (one way) a day plus around town a bit, and even with all the Missouri hills we average 26 mpg (have seen it average 30 mpg on pure highway travel). The Toyota can probably match that but I know that the Nissan Rogue with its CVT would have issues when it comes to hills. We've owned two Nissan's with CVTs-while very good on gas on flat surfaces, they are extremely bad in hilly areas. Otherwise, the CR-V is a great, quiet, and comfortable ride with lots of space. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride is very good - not much tire or wind noise; the craftsmanship; the cubbies; the vast open space in front and back; the stereo is not bad either. Very good A/C ( better than competitors) but could use rear vents on super hot days.</FAVORITE>

I am getting 28 mpg on the highway and 25mpg overall, I am sure this will improve once the car is driven more. Honda is so focused on small details of the car, both interior and exterior features, and the ride is very quiet and comfortable. The styling of my suv, and it is the base model, is extremely sharp looking and rivals the appearance of much more expensive vehicles. The dealer experience has been great so far, I hope to have this Honda for many years. I would recommend the Honda Cr-v,</TEXT>

Looked at RAV-4's (didn't like tire attached to tail gate), Murano (too expensive), Escape (already have one, but didn't like the MPG and really no significant design change since early 2003). I was adamant about getting a V- 6 until I drove the CR-V and was astonished at the 4 cyl power! With the functional interior and no non- sense design I am extremely happy so far.

<TEXT>We bought our CR-V in January, after driving a van for eight years. I really like the size of the vehicle. I needed something that was big enough to haul things like 50 lb bags of animal feed and a bale of hay once in awhile, and it can. We also needed a vehicle that got good gas mileage. This vehicle has met all our needs for hauling and I gets between 25-31 mpg. per tank. If I set the cruise control and then decel a bit, I get the best mileage. The only thing that I miss about the van is the cushy ride. The CR-V has a stiff ride, no luxury . Air conditioner works well on 100 degree days. The hitch can haul a small trailer, also the rack is good for camping and kayak . Overall very happy.</TEXT>

After a lot of research and test drives we settled on the CR-V and have been very happy with our choice. We just took the CRV on a 2200 mile round trip to visit some family members and it performed better than we had hoped. We averaged 29 MPG on the trip. The CRV was comfortable and fun to drive.

Immediately we knew that we made a huge error. After 3600 miles, we traded for a New CR-V EXL. We are hooked. I actually attained 36 MPG on a freeway trip driving at 59 MPH with the cruise control set. Unfortunately, the trade was expensive because I was at the dealer's mercy. Am I sorry? Heck no.

<TEXT>Previously, I owned a Honda civic and held on to it for 8 years. I put a lot of mileage on a car and my civic was the first car I had ever owned that had lasted so long (8 years) with no major malfunctions, so I was already a Honda fan. I've had my CR-V a week now, but I do really enjoy it. It's fun and easy to drive, and comfortable, with great gas mileage for its class. I've had no problems at all with it so far, and love many of the features of the EX-L style. I would highly recommend this vehicle to others - it's a fun, convenient car, with plenty of space, good driving, and Honda's impressive reliability. </TEXT>
