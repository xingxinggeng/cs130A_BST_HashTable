<TEXT>I am mostly happy with the Hybrid. However the paint is beginning to blister in small areas the size of a pencil eraser. I have found that this type of paint problem has been found before with Toyota vehicles. I have had the SUV for about five months now and the dealer told me to contact Toyota USA to resolve the problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was in love with this vehicle from the moment I test drove it OVER A YEAR ago. So it took me a year to buy this vehicle. I am so glad i did (although my payments are wayyyy more than what I was wanting). It drives like a dream, has plenty of space for my mid-large size dog, and my workmates who I carpool with once a week. I am consistently getting 30.5 - 32 MPG off of my first 4 tanks so far. My buddies have all said the back seat is "cavernous" compared to my 2008 rav4 (I traded it in for this car). They also said the seats were "very comfortable". Get this car if you plan on keeping for 10+ years, the fuel savings won't catch up until then because of the price premium. I LOVE it!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design is excellent, seats are comfy (leather), drive is smooth as can be, my MPG is better than the EPA estimates, feels like a luxury car, perfect city driver with the added room for my dog and carpool buddies</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am using for the past one year and definitely worthy in buying this still it costs more. Good for long drives and slow driving will save more gas. Seating comfort is excellent with lots of room for the legs. Altogether a good one and also good for carrying more goods in the back than the old models.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned 1 month. So far this car is perfect for our needs. Has plenty of power, big nav/back up screen, good stereo sound, quiet ride. Waited 3 yrs for the 2010 RX 350 and finally saw it at the SF Auto show. It looked essentially the same as the old version, which we didn't care for, only slightly bigger. While at the show checked out all the Xs (MDX, RDX, FX, EX) but for the money there was no comparison, at least from a tech side and sitting in the showroom, plus this runs on regular gas. The next weekend we test drove them all except the 2010 RX which is available in Feb and found the all wheel version of this car to be as good as any of the others. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Large Nav/ backup screen. Comfortable seating position, and third row seat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Highway mileage is great, 28 mpg at 70+ mph. We live at the top of a hill, + 650' over the valley where we shop and work; so my town driving isn't great, around 21 mpg, but 10+ mpg over the Yukon I had before at the same run. My major issue at the moment is the big tires on the Ltd edition, Toyo 245- 55-19, are a problem as I can't find chains to fit. With freezing rain over snow, chains are required on all roadways. The Toyo tires are just OK on the ice & snow, but I can't get any of the excellent Michelin X-type tires to fit the wheels. Comfort is pretty good, but I miss the roomyness and soft leather of my old Yukon Denali, woos, I'll make due. Overall, quite satisfied with the HH.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The hybrid system works well and the highway and flatland mileage is good. The third seat is clever and has come in handy while staying out of the way, much better than the Denali. Not an off-road rig, but then neither was the Yukon. Good turning radius and reasonable handling under geeser demands.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this car for 6 months now. I'm averaging 27 mpg in mixed driving. I really love the way this car drives and looks. The 2nd row seats are very roomy and great design. The 3rd row that I thought I would never use, has saved the day on several occasions. I love every single thing about this car except for one. The XM radio receiver I had installed at my dealership came with a little surprise. Toyota engineers didn't think to make the radio display scroll information. It only displays 13 characters. So while I'm enjoying the wide range of music, I get to play a guessing game if the name of the band or song are more than 13 letters. Huge disappointment! </TEXT>

<TEXT>There's nothing bad to say. I'm getting great gas mileage for an SUV, 24-32 mpg. You have to pay attention to your driving style to get it though, no fast accelerating, etc. It handles really well for you non-sports car drivers. It's easy to drive, fun and very comfortable. Tons of room, head and legs, unless you are 6-2 and try to fit in the third row, although that still was better than any small car backseat I've been stuffed in. The standard features with the base model are good enough although mine came with the popular plus package which came with more features than I would have asked for. This vehicle was simply better than anything else I researched and/or test drove. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Being an engineer I way underestimated this vehicle. The better half primarily drives it but I look forward to the rare opportunity to "steal" it. Our location uses ethanol in the fuels. We are now at around 10,000 miles and getting around 29 MPG (note using Mobil1 synthetic oil). I think it was a little lower when it was new. The hybrid system is seamless and a pleasure to drive. The seats and controls are well positioned thus comfortable to operate. Handles great and is comforting to know every time you hit the brakes a great deal of energy goes back into the batteries.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Towing package is standard. There is a small funnel mounted to the block under the oil filter, no mess oil change. Rear tires are electrically driven only, less mechanical drag on the system. During towing the CVT and hybrid system are incredibly smooth and peppy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought this car 1 week a go with only 7 miles on the odometer. I put 900 miles on it in one week (went on a road trip). I have averaged 26 mpg both in city and highway. I drove over a nail and a warning light showed me that I was losing psi in one of the tires. Without this feature I could have been stuck late at night on the road with 2 young kids. I stopped at the nearest gas station, filled up with air, and made it to my destination safely. I have a fully loaded limited hybrid and love it! The kids watched movies on the dual tv headrests while I listened to my iPod and called family via the voice activated blue tooth feature. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought this vehicle because of a desire to do my part against OPEC and I needed a new one. The car started out with a mileage of 11.5 miles per gallon on the dash board computer. After approx 120 miles it is up to 22.5. So far I am disappointed because I am expecting to get the sticker mileage of 27 MPG. I was shocked and disappointed by the lack of luggage room when the fold away seats were unfolded. Folded there is plenty of room for stuff. I missed having my headlights turn on automatically when needed. I love the key less operation but because of the quietness I have gotten out of the car with the car still "running." roof needs protective strips to protect carrying baggage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Picked this up last month. Got it at invoice since the car market is slow and 2009 models are coming. VERY impressed with the car. Drove every hybrid out there and thought the RX400h would be the one but there is really no comparison between the two. The RX is an older, noisier, less luxurious ride than the Highlander and, interestingly, very few people realize that. That may change in 2010 with the new RXh. This Highlander really excels in many areas. Mileage around town has been 26.5 mpg-better than we read here. It is very quiet and the intelligence of the interior layout is impressive. This is my wife's car and she's coming from a Lexus LS430 Ultra and she is more than satisfied.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smart Key is very impressive. Locking and unlocking are easy and quick as is the start up of the car. The key hasn't left my or my wife's pocket yet. The visual displays are informative and easy to understand. Sound quality on the JBL is better than expected. The quietness of the cabin is very good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm an extremely experience & picky SUV driver, I've spent over 2 months test driving several SUVs in the market which includes BMW X5, BMW X6, Land Rover LR3, Mercedes M-Class, and Porsche Cayenne. Yes, they are nice and fast, but nothing blow me away like Highlander Hybrid, it amazed me by its unconventional and futuristic technology with Synergy drive, VDIM, and CVT. European/American SUVs in the market attract the buyer by putting a bigger engine, bigger disk brakes to achieve better speed and cornering, but none of them put as much work as Toyota on engineering such clean and environmentally friendly vehicle. I am getting 29 MPG with my Highlander Hybrid in mix city/highway.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Highlander Hybrid's interior is about 1/3 less noise than BMW X5 and Porsche Cayenne. The second generation Synergy drive is really a technological marvel, it's so refined. VDIM definitely beats BMW's DSC; I've seen several videos on the web, it outperforms BMW X5 when racing on wet/ice surface.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We were moving back to the US from Japan and wanted a Hybrid SUV. We are planning on a larger family than we have right now and needed the space. Also, since the gas prices had been going sky-high, we felt we needed the hybrid. We also did some simple math computation and realized that getting the hybrid for about $4K more that the non-hybrid, we could save about $3K in gas per year. (It pays for itself in 2 years!) Haven't had ANY trouble, it is perfect.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Driven several BMW, Mercedes, and Land Rover SUVs Highlander Hybrid is far superior in terms of comfort, fuel economy and reliability. I have been driving my new HiHy for about a month and still wondering how it is putting together especially the transition from EV to ICE is seamless. Because of my office's location I have to drive approx 3 hours a day, and driving this vehicle is really effortless and smooth without worrying wasting gas in traffic jams. This car is innovative, it has leading edge technology, and the most important it is extremely reliable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this vehicle for about 680 miles and two tanks at 23.5 and 25.5 mpg. Not bad coming from a V8 Grand Cherokee @ 13 mpg. Ride is comfortable but a bit soft according to my preferences. Body roll and motions are controlled but nevertheless a bit too active for my taste. Steering is light which is good in parking lots but overly sensitive on the highway. Hybrid system works well but requires much attention to use effectively and optimally. Overall, the vehicle is quiet and suits my family needs well albeit in an unexciting and uninspiring way. If not for the hybrid system and the need for a SUV, I would have looked elsewhere.</TEXT>

<TEXT>~200 miles so far. Comfortable but chassis is geared for grandma. I prefer more responsive steering and suspension feedback but hey, this is a Toyota. I bought this for the MPG only and the need for a SUV. Otherwise not too exciting. Ride is quiet but steering is a bit loose at highway speeds. Too much assist and its not the speed sensitive type. Center console lacks imagination. No coin slot for individual coins amongst others. I can fit a rear facing carseat behind the passenger seat and someone can still ride in the front. Too bad you can't put the child seat in the center and have two 2nd row passengers (seat belt interferes) So far about 24mpg... lots of breaking in left</TEXT>

<TEXT>Since purchasing our Toyota Highlander Hybrid in December of 2007, we've driven nearly 9,000 miles. The car sees cold and snow when we visit Colorado in the winter and extreme heat when we visit Arizona in the summer. It is comfortable in both extremes. Very good in snow and ice, and quite at home on Mexico beaches. We've averaged 26-27 MPG with little effort, but we do drive somewhat slower with gas at $4.00. The interior features are a little more than we desired, but we wanted leather seating. The backup camera is hard to see when it's sunny and we have a small hard to detect rattle in the dash. We're sure Toyota will find the rattle and we'll keep the car until it has a plug-in accessory</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned the H/H for 4 months and love the vehicle. It drives and rides like a dream. We took 4 people, 4 medium suitcases, and 4 sets of golf clubs on a 1300 mile golf and wine buying trip. The back was full to the ceiling but we still had room for two cases of wine to bring home.Overall gas mileage is averaging 25mpg. So far we get better highway mpg 26-27 than city 24-25. Gas mileage was about 2.5 mpg higher before Oregon stuck it to the public with ethanol. Acceleration and passing ability is good, but if you lead foot the car a lot while driving it will cost you in mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned an Audi A6 prior to this and all I can say is I love this car! Sure, the Audi looked a little sportier, but it was constantly having mechanical problems or one little plastic piece or another break off inside. This car is much more rugged and reliable. It can take abuse by bumpy roads and kids without a hiccup. I love the keyless remote - so handy when my keys are at the bottom of my purse. The huge backup camera screen, extra wide mirror, and super adjustable seat mean that I can be comfortable and have great visibility. My sister has a comparably sized Acura and is gets a measly 10mpg, far below its advertised mpg -- and the dealer has not been able to fix it. Love my car! </TEXT>

It has meet our needs well and so far we have averaged about 27 mpg using the econ mode and focusing on how we drive the vehicle. Toyota builds a great car, just not a very exciting car. Don't get me wrong, it does everyting it is supposed to do and does it well, just very conservatively and below the radar.

<TEXT>I have had this car since Dec 2007 and love it. I've been averaging 25.5 mpg (through winter, spring, and summer driving). It's been great for my family of four with plenty of space. I bought the base model but added leather (through a 3rd party), nav, bluetooth, iPod connectivity, DVD interoperability, a rear DVD player and heated seats.

<TEXT>We have purchased the hybrid and so far we are far from satisfied. The black box that displays engine performance has died. Lojack and handsfree telephone (dealer installed) took 2 weeks to get installed and the handsfree doesn't work and there was no manuals for either. We were told by the salesman and his manager we could get a luggage rack without having to get the sunroof (between skin cancer on my bald head and the fact I'm 6'4" the sunroof takes up headroom) only to be told after buying the car we couldn't get a rack without the sunroof package.

<TEXT>My feelings on this vehicle are very mixed. We bought this to replace our gas guzzling pathfinder. It is touted as getting between 25 & 27 miles to the gallon, which we were getting until about a month ago when it fell and has not gone above 22 MPG. We took it in to get inspected and went through all the obvious factors, tire pressure, driving habits,and so on. They informed us that it takes 5,000 to 10,000 miles to "break in" the vehicle and see the actual MPG.We were informed that 26 MPG was not actually realistic and those tests are done under conditions which are impossible to drive under. I am not saying its a bad vehicle, but don't believe your salesperson that u are going to get 26 MPG</TEXT>

Continue with Toyota's attention to comfort and ergonomics. Top it all off with 270 hp and 460 ft lbs of torque (almost as much as my turbo diesel!!) and it's hard to believe that it holds 7 people and gets 27 mpg!!

<TEXT>Driving a hybrid in order to maximize fuel economy is definitely a skill. And that is why I had to give a lower "fun" score. Simply getting in the car and driving away as you would any other car will not yield optimal fuel economy. Read about "hypermiling" for more info. The power steering and shocks could be a little stiffer to give a sportier, controlled driving experience. The car leans more into turns than my 4Runner. The interior is definitely designed for luxury and comfort. The Synergy system and variable transmission work seamlessly to provide power when needed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car for my wife (but of course I had to get it with all of the toys for me). We looked at the GMC Acadia, Mazda CX-9, and the Toyota Highlander. None of the above really compared to the highlander in terms of style, options, and reliability. Initially we were not considering a hybrid, but one came to the lot in our area. With gas now approach $3.50 a gallon, I am beginning to think we made a good decision. With our 3rd tank of gas, we are averaging about 26.2 mpg. This should improve as we break in the engine. The navigation takes a bit of practice to master, but after taking one evening to sit down and learn it, it is quite simple.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the gas mileage we are getting with a high powered V6 (and still has get up and go). The navigation/Bluetooth, auto-lift gate, hybrid monitor, rear back up camera are all great features. I also enjoy the ease of lowering the middle row seats from the rear of the car</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Many complaints about this vehicle saying it is "sluggish" on a test drive. My guess is that the dealer had the "ECON" button engaged when they pushed the accelerator down. The 270 horse is more than enough to get out of a jam. Comfort is definitely not an issue. It came down to the Ford Escape Hy or this vehicle, and while the ford gets better gas mileage and is a little more "off-road" ready, this car is built much better, and the average commuter will feel less bumps in the road. FYI, you have to be VERY active in your driving style to get the 27 mpg city in this car. It will take a while for you to learn the techniques to maximize fuel economy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Before buying our Highlander, we researched and drove both the Ford Escape and Lexus RX 400h and found that for the money, the Toyota was a far better buy. The console is easy to read and operate i.e., big print. Plenty of head and leg room with added storage within arms reach, 4 drink holders, etc. too many extras to mention. After keeping mileage records for 3 months, we average 26.7 mpg. My husband, a truck guy, was hesitant about buying a hybrid, however he now hides the keys from me. The pick-up and go is comparable to any other 6cyl, however this vehicle is not for towing anything over 3500pds which we do with ease. All around a nice buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking between the Highlander, Lexus 400h, and Saturn Vue Hybrid. The Saturn and Lexus were both much smaller than the Highlander and the gas mileage was the same of less than what the Highlander was rated, so I went with the Highlander, plus it was the most comfortable. Navigation system took some time to get used to, but I like it now, the bluetooth capability should come with every car made, it's amazing. The only thing the highlander was missing was an iPod jack, but it does come with an auxiliary jack, which you can connect to the iPod, just not as convenient. Currently getting about 25.5 in the city and 26.7 highway, which is reverse according to the sticker. Overall love it!</TEXT>

<FAVORITE>EV only mode, AUX audio input/MP3 cd player, towing ability, very roomy interior (i'm 6'3"), multi-function display. Limited Edition is about 95% as nice as the Lexus 400h, at about 90% the price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I actually bought this for my wife, but have been hogging it. The fit and finish is top notch and the car delivers a tight, smooth ride. Gas mileage in the mid-20s, which isn't great, but good enough to still feel superior that I'm driving a hybrid :)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE> I really like the bluetooth and nav.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The thing that makes the 2008 Highlander Hybrid is the gas electric meter so you can monitor your gas/electric use. Very fun and a great way to max out the MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought a 2008 HH AWD (iced amethyst mica) fully loaded except for navi. We are very happy with it! Fun to drive, good performance and comfort. We love this car.Our average mpg is about 24-27 mpg, I think it will improve this summer. Our worst mpg was 22 mpg, best was 28 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've wanted a hybrid for a couple of years. Giving up my Montero was tough - it had great style and fit my large family well, but the Earth's needs came first so I bought the HiHy. We are more cramped than we used to be but we are very comfortable. The ride is much more like a luxury car. I find that I drive with a more relaxed style now since I can see on the display how I'm using the engine (EV, EV-assist or gas). The roofrack is adjustable so our topper for our camping gear and my kayak will fit nicely. My absolute only complaint, and it's minor: it's got no style. But I'll take 'not much to look at' for the super low emissions and the comfort. I'm very pleased with it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The display is really nice. I can tell exactly what's going on with the tire pressure, the engine(s), the back-up camera is there, the trip odometer, system functions, it's very cool :) </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We traded our 2005 Highlander Limited with 65,000 miles for an '08 Highlander Hybrid and went from average 21 mpg to average 26 mpg, more performance, more room and comfort. It wasn't cheap and we expect to keep it past 100,000 miles. We were not impressed that the new Limited didn't include roof rack crossbars ($200) or door side moldings($180). The rear-seat-floor battery vents must not be blocked and that removes some room when we pack the car for long trips.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hybrid technology, comfort for long drives - especially seating, seating flexibility, respectable performance for 65+ year olds and hopefully Toyota trade-in value. The CVT gives the impression of better performance than the tests indicate. Very smooth.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just got it about two weeks ago. I have previously owned a 2005 Camry and I traded in my 2007 Rav4 for this one. Oh boy this was the best decision I made, this SUV is a combination of a sedan and the styling of a Crossover. Definitely eye-catching and stunning on the road, and the ride is astounding. Toyota made a hit! Mileage is reasonable considering the size and the options. This SUV is incomparable to anything in its class.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smart Key System. Multi-information display/ back-up camera. EV and Econ Mode. Blizzard pearl color. The exterior body. I love this SUV!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle is just about perfect. Ride is great, driving dynamics are good for a bigger SUV, and the mileage for a vehicle this size is outstanding. We test drove the Escape Hybrid and it falls way short of the Highlander in comfort, and overall driving feel. This car is the perfect compliment to our Prius. Not only do you we get over 26 MPG, the car can seat 7 and tow 3500 pounds. I don't know of any other vehicle that can do that. We typically trade in our cars every few years, but this one is going to stay for quite a while, or at least until Toyota comes out with a plug in model. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smart Key, power rear door, back up camera without having to pay for the nav system. JBL stereo is great. Econ mode for the tranny is also a help. Very comfortable car, and the attention to detail is obvious.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned my 08 Highlander Hybrid for just 5 days but I am very happy. I am a discerning consumer and I researched and thought about thiw vehicle for 5 months before purchasing. I have owned Toyotas for 23 years and this is the best out of the gate. It is actually smoother and quieter than I expected and rivals my Avalon - BUT the pick-up power is till great!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Every imaginable gadget, great looks, great ride, it did not disappoint. Got just under 32 MPG driving to work today (25 miles in stop and go traffic). The car is great, if you could just actually order one with what you want in it, that would be big.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav/Bluetooth is awesome, also audio/video/110V outlet that comes with the rear-screen entertainment center, we can use our Tivo in the Highlander or bring along the WII.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Very happy overall. Very quiet, very good MPG 1st tank 26, 2nd 28, 3rd 28 and fourth 31 MPG! True, lots of LA traffic involved to get those numbers. We also own a Prius so we have practice at driving hybrids. I'm 6'3" and have lots of leg room. Front seats could have a bit more thigh support, but still very comfortable. Would have prefered black leather interior...not offered. I've owned lots of Toyotas this one is by far the best.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first hybrid. I have noticed that if you want to milk every bit of mpg from this vehicle, you need to drive in ECON mode. Using ECON mode I get 25 mpg in mixed driving. Without ECON mode I get around 20 mpg - sometimes less. EV mode is, IMHO, a marketing gimmick as it will not work unless the temperature is right, the batteries are fully charged, etc, etc, etc. When idling in park or in traffic, you sometimes feel a bump and small surge forward. When driving, you do not feel gas/electric switching at all. In ECON mode, acceleration is damped to conserve fuel. In normal mode this vehicle is quite powerful and easily gets to freeway speeds.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Voice command system allows control over all aspects of the electronics. JBL sounds system provides great sound to all types of music. Automatic headlight system ensures lights are on/off at appropriate times. Nav display screen is HUGE and bright. Many system display options all useful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After a year of research and test driving various SUVs and crossovers we settled on the HH and decided to order exactly what we wanted. We had test driven several HH and other hybrids and all were quiet, but none impressed us like the HH. When our HH came in we were excited. It was beautiful and had everything we wanted, except for the NOISE! When we brake to slow down it sounds like a jet engine winding down. It also has a click. We were expecting the quiet we had experienced with the other HHs we drove, but were greatly disappointed. The dealership has told us that some hybrids have that noise more than others - it is normal. I won't order again. I buy what I test drive on the lot.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the comfort of the vehicle and the solid feel of the car. This is perfect for just my husband and me during the week, but has enough room for when our grandsons are with us on vacation. Gas mileage after 2 tanks is about 26 MPG. Power liftgate, stow and go seat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife has always wanted the Lexus GX SUV due to reliability, luxury and performance, so for christmas I started shopping vehicles. I had never heard of a Highlander and I am very familiar with cars. When the dealer suggested we consider this new hybrid I had very little interest until sitting in the vehicle and driving it. Wow. It was clearly a better overall vehicle than any of the other SUVs I had been testing. The interior is a family room on wheels. Lots of room, all the features of high end SUVs, and the engine flat out gets after it. We get 24 mpg while driving very aggressive and fast. The all wheel drive has been excellent in the snow. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very realistic and comfortable third row seating. Blue tooth, navigation, dual climate control, dvd, jbl stereo, incredible acceleration out of a fuel efficient, all wheel drive, seven passenger SUV. System diagnostic check. Too many great features to list.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought 11/2007. Traded a 07 highlander limited because wanted better mpg. Thought a 2008 highlander hybrid would be a good choice. So far not the case. We are paying much much more and getting the same mpg as the 07 highlander. A hybrid should get better than 18 mpg. Tried different octanes and so far nothing has worked. Very, very disappointed and stuck with it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the 2008 Highlander Hybrid for only a short time so there are some items I cannot yet address. The car is very comfortable and quiet. Handling is good, but I have not yet had an opportunity to test it in harder driving (twisting roads, etc.). It is much larger, inside and out, than the 2007 model. The biggest shortcoming is rear visibility. The rear window is so darkly tinted that nothing can be seen when backing in the dark. (Obviously, the rear camera helps a lot in this case.) The second is the ugly color choices. I was able to purchase it for a few hunderd dollars under list.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the back up camera. Driver seating position is just about perfect with the power seat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Highlander Hybrid is almost everything we hoped for, typical Toyota near perfect fit and finish. Mileage is averaging 25 after 1st 1200 miles. High tank on Oregon Coast trip of 29 MPG, low tank MPG 23. My experience with hilly areas with any hybrid CVT produce lower mileage figures and holds true with the Highlander. I have owned Escape, Prius and Civic hybrids with this being smoothest drive train transition of any hybrid. Decision between RX 400 and waiting for Highlander has been good one. More room and seating configurations, better mileage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was fortunate in finding a 2008 Highlander Hybrid Limited in one of the colors that I wanted, Iced Amethyst Mica, and equipped the way I wanted it, everything but Nav and RES, that wasn't either special ordered for someone or already claimed! I picked it up last night, so it's a little early to make any firm commitments about anything, but so far we're off to a great start. I've not noticed any build or fit and finish issues and I am pretty meticulous about these things. Driving it is a pleasure and makes me intensely curious about what, exactly, is going on 'under the hood.' This will be a vehicle that's fun to drive and will also keep me intrigued for a long time to come.</TEXT>
