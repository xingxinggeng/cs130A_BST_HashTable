<TEXT>Due to the growing size of our family a car that seated 6 or more was in order. We did not want a minivan, already had an SUV, wanted a wagon or something that drove more like a car for our long road trips to the beach. This Crossover gives everyone their own room and plenty of it with a nice smooth ride. Bought used and it was well worth the price (new was out of our league), plus it has the Warranty so Mercedes service fixes almost everything. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The kids love the Panoramic Sunroof. I enjoy the roominess as I'm 6 foot 3. My wife loves the automatic liftgate, opens up with a button and the kids just climb in the back. 7-Seat option is a must. I-Pod connector is cool.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We traded in our Porsche Cayenne for an R350 due to passenger limitation in the Porsche. The Mercedes offered a spacious interior with comfort and luxury as well as easy maneuverability. The engine can be sluggish to start but the ride is smooth once you get going. If you're tall, you may want to think twice as there is little clearance between my head and the interior roof of the car without moving the seat all the way down. The sun visor is also tricky to put down without having to move my head back. Difficult to get used to after having 2 suv's with more height and flexibility. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Panoramic sunroof. Sound system is good and easy to use. 3rd row seats fold down easily. Safety and comfort. More rugged than expected in the snow.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am coming from a 2007 Escalade ESV and have to say I had a lot of reservations about "downsizing"! We have 4 kids 2 of which in car seats and wow is all I can say about this car. I love that the 2nd row seats can move back and forth allowing for very easy access to the 3rd row which seats my 6ft plus 15 year old very nicely! The pick up is great and it is tons of fun to drive. Not too mention very pleasing to the eye to look at. I would say so far my only con is that it seems to have a lot of little things go wrong. Less then a month of owning it the steering column broke in my kids school parking lot and I could not turn the wheels which was scary to say the least. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the interior features very simple yet very nice. It seems very durable thus far. I like the sound system and the nav features are very easy to use. I like the address book that allows for phone numbers to be entered. I love the looks of this car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our 2nd R-class and our umpteenth Benz. We had a R350 and an E- class in LA and now that we've moved to Jakarta, we decided to get another one this time a 7 seater and CDI to combat Jakarta's traffic. Having first bought a Toyota Alphard here, we now find it too big for self-drives and prefer the R-class. The 7 seating version makes better sense and more practical. We've now passed-on the Alphard to the kids for their activities and keep the R-class between my partner and me. We're no longer getting an S-class since the R- class also carries a lot of panache and grandeur without being too overbearing especially when we self- drive on the weekend and during vacation and not use the drive</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We like the 7 seating arrangement and fuel economy of the R320 CDI. We also like the panoramic moon-roof although we hardly ever open it in smog-congested Jakarta. The quiet Mercedes-Benz diesel engine is also a big plus as it can sometimes be a little bit mortifying to drive a noisy Benz. Well- done</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Pro?s: I had an BMW X3 and drove the X5 along with the MDX the MB had the smoothest ride, best safety features (BMW doesn?t have third row curtin airbags), 3 rows of seating and the greatest comfort in the third row. Pricing was excellent got almost 16K off a brand new 08 and low 66 month 2.9% financing. Everything top of the line quality, metal feels thick strong and confident on the road. MB originally wanted to sell these in 06 for 60-80K. This was built to be a great cruiser like the s class. Feels like the s class and the panoramic roof is incredible. Cons: Navi not easy to use </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Panoramic roof, auto rear hatch, safety, drive is smooth like butter, does not rock the kids like the BMW X series models, third row can really seat adults, can still move 2nd row seats forward to get to the 3rd row with 2 baby seats in place in the 2nd row.

<TEXT>My wife and I were in the market to replace our Yukon XL 4x4. We were looking at the GMC Arcadia and Buick Enclave when at the time I became aquainted with an R350 at our research lab for vehicle design and repairability review. With all of the safety features this car provided along with the amazing interior room, the R class was just right for my family of 5. I am a first time MB buyer so this may be the last one I buy or the first of many. We are so very pleased with the vehicle. It drives like a cloud. We thought we would miss the Yukon, but those memories are gone. This car provides for all of our needs and then some. We just love this car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We have enjoyed having the back-up camera and the park assist feature. The leg room is short of incredible in this car. We opted for the P2 package, and I'm glad we did as it provides the Nav system and other nice features like the disk changer and I- Pod.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My title says it all. The R-Class is the vehicle you grow to after the kids are too big for a van anymore. Teens now drive, they're too cool and big to be climbing in a van and this is just perfect. There's room for the drums and trips to the warehouse stores. It's not too tall so you don't get dirty getting stuff out of the back. It's better than a modern wagon. It's better than a van. It's better than I could ever imagine. Mercedes Benz is right on for the people that this was designed for but missing the marketing boat! They really need to interview some of us late 40's crowd. Have hand issues? Weak wrists? Carpal tunnel? You'll love how you shift gears in this jet. Lightly tap a button!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Automatic liftgate, hands free phone, parktronic laser letting you know if you're too close to an object when parking, power seats, quick touch cruise control and gear shifting, huge back trunk space when back seats are folded down, large spacious ride for 2nd and 3rd rows. My teens love this wagon.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We were looking for passenger room, and better fuel economy than our Suburban, and were very interested in a diesel. This vehicle looks sharp, seats 6-7 very comfortably, and I couldn't be happier driving it! We average 28 mpg with highway driving, and about 23 in town. With the back seat down, there is good storage space, and when using the back seat for passengers, no one complains about the comfort back there, as they did in the Suburban. We are thrilled with this vehicle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>You'll love this vehicle if you have "tweens". Those teens that are not licensed to drive alone, so you still have to haul them and their high school buddies one or two more years. These teens have outgrown the 'soccer mom's van' and they, too, want to look cool if they are still going to have to be chauffeured by Mom or Dad. The driver will love saving your wrists and joints by just having to tap with your finger the steering column wand to change gears. 26 mpg is a deal sealer on this large vehicle. This is such a wonderful vehicle! You need to market to true baby boomers and tween families, such as I described. CALL this vehicle a WAGON... and it ain't yo' mama's wagon of the past</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this car after an exhaustive research process into every car with 3 row. Did not want giant SUV (Suburban, Esalade) and biggest new Lexus did not have comfy back row. R-Class is extremely comfy in all rows. Middle row even shifts forward allowing additional room in the rear, if desired. Car runs very smoothly as one would expect from a MB. Middle row appears to have as much leg room as an S-Class and more head room. We opted for the center seat, which is good for child, but not full width. Cargo space with all seats in place is okay, but not great. Rear seats manually fold flat like a minivans. MB did away with the 5.0 litre engine. 3.5 is sluggish and a disappointment.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the panoramic roof giving the middle and back rows a glass ceiling. Unbelievably comfy and spacious seats in all rows. Auto open/close gate is nice. Backup camera (should be standard) is good as well. Park-assist beeps when close to cars in front/back and very useful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My previous car was an E350 MB. While I loved the handling and styling of the car, I chose the R-class for the room and seating capacity. However I was also surprised with the way the car handles and I really love the styling. I pretty much leave the rear seats down but I like knowing that they are available if needed. I love how long the cargo space is with the 2nd row laid down for extra room If I need to haul longer items. Right now with the great lease and retail programs they have on the R- class, it makes it a great value.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We had a Mecedes wagon with a rear seat but were looking for a vehicle with a larger interior. We also waited for the 2008 that created a 3 person seat in the second row. This vehicle has been everything my wife has wanted and she can handle its size even in tight locations. She loves to drive it. I happen to like to drive it as well. With all the SUVs on the road and having two younger children, we feel much safer in this vehicle, even over the MB wagon. The long wheel base makes for a very smooth drive and ride (even in the 3rd seat that two adults can sit comfortably in). This is definitely a vehicle worth test driving! It will make you strongly consider it as a purchase option.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the panoramic roof with all the glass to see out. It makes sitting in the 2nd or 3rd seat seem much more open. The back-up camera is a great help along with the bumper sensors that let you know if you are coming too closs to an object. The seating is also very comfortable. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I practically stumbled across this car when I decided to check out the MB lot just for the heck of it one day. We had been looking closely at the GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave, but I was blown away by the interior size, comfort and luxury touches of this vehicle. Our R class includes fantastic features such as the backup camera, panorama roof (awesome), 6 CD changer, Sirius radio for 6 months, and the 7 seat option. The car rides very well and the torque makes up for what the HP lacks. Although I should say with three kids, I want exactly looking for massive power -- more for interior space and three rows of seats, which the R class has in spades.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cavernous room in the interior. Even the third row is generous. MB quality, smooth yet sporty feel, panorama roof, backup camera, Nav system, michelin tires, easy access to the back row, parktronic, even the Smart Key is cool.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car a fantastic family verhicle. Not only does it ride like a Mercedes S-Class but it has the same unrivaled leg room - even in the third row. I love th ease of converting from three rows to two and back - the only car I know where this can be done with one hand from the rear of the car while loading! You will love riding this car and long road trips will be a breeze.</TEXT>

<FAVORITE>3rd row can seat adults in comfort. Panoramic roof has to be seen to be believed. My daughter can actually walk between the 2nd and 3rd row, when parked naturally. Solid throughout. I trust this car with my family's safety.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At first, I went to get a 4 door sedan, therefore I was hesitant to get what I thought of as a "minivan in disguise". But the more I drive it, the more I love it! I like the way it handles both on the highway and around the city. It feels like a Mercedes Benz car not a minivan or truck. People love the back seats, and the plentiful leg room available. The diesel model, which I have, is giving me great mileage per gallon of gas. I love that the seats in the back can be arranged in different configurations, very versatile. It is very luxurious inside. The sound system is excellent.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We needed a family vehicle that could seat 6-7 people comfortably and still provide space for baby gear, groceries or luggage. We wanted a cross-over type of vehicle, not a monster SUV, and something that still provided luxury, safety and performance. I have been an Audi driver for the past five years so comfort, performance and safety were key. After looking at a number of vehicles we decided to look at the R Class. (The Audi Q7 didn't cut it with cubic space.) I am very pleased with the key factors I had to consider and extremely happy with the space we were seeking. We chose the P1 package with a couple of extras, the I-pod hook up (I love) and heated seats. </TEXT>

The back-up camera is a great help along with the bumper sensors that let you know if you are coming too closs to an object. The seating is also very comfortable. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I practically stumbled across this car when I decided to check out the MB lot just for the heck of it one day. We had been looking closely at the GMC Acadia and Buick Enclave, but I was blown away by the interior size, comfort and luxury touches of this vehicle. Our R class includes fantastic features such as the backup camera, panorama roof (awesome), 6 CD changer, Sirius radio for 6 months, and the 7 seat option. The car rides very well and the torque makes up for what the HP lacks. Although I should say with three kids, I want exactly looking for massive power -- more for interior space and three rows of seats, which the R class has in spades.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cavernous room in the interior. Even the third row is generous. MB quality, smooth yet sporty feel, panorama roof, backup camera, Nav system, michelin tires, easy access to the back row, parktronic, even the Smart Key is cool.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car a fantastic family verhicle. Not only does it ride like a Mercedes S-Class but it has the same unrivaled leg room - even in the third row. I love th ease of converting from three rows to two and back - the only car I know where this can be done with one hand from the rear of the car while loading! You will love riding this car and long road trips will be a breeze.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Motorized hatch with remote control - third row stow-away mechanism - interior design and rooom like S Class.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We are so happy with this car. We chose it over the LR3. MDX. XC90. Q7. It's smooth, spacious and solid. It's got the space inside that others have wasted. This is a well designed and very unique car. I would buy again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>3rd row can seat adults in comfort. Panoramic roof has to be seen to be believed. My daughter can actually walk between the 2nd and 3rd row, when parked naturally. Solid throughout. I trust this car with my family's safety.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At first, I went to get a 4 door sedan, therefore I was hesitant to get what I thought of as a "minivan in disguise". But the more I drive it, the more I love it! I like the way it handles both on the highway and around the city. It feels like a Mercedes Benz car not a minivan or truck. People love the back seats, and the plentiful leg room available. The diesel model, which I have, is giving me great mileage per gallon of gas. I love that the seats in the back can be arranged in different configurations, very versatile. It is very luxurious inside. The sound system is excellent.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seat arrangeament versatility, and the leg room. I like that the trunk door can be opened and close with the remote control. The radio and I-Pod connectivity are also easy to handle,</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We needed a family vehicle that could seat 6-7 people comfortably and still provide space for baby gear, groceries or luggage. We wanted a cross-over type of vehicle, not a monster SUV, and something that still provided luxury, safety and performance. I have been an Audi driver for the past five years so comfort, performance and safety were key. After looking at a number of vehicles we decided to look at the R Class. (The Audi Q7 didn't cut it with cubic space.) I am very pleased with the key factors I had to consider and extremely happy with the space we were seeking. We chose the P1 package with a couple of extras, the I-pod hook up (I love) and heated seats. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy access, automatic opening and closing of the trunk, i-pod connection, ability to operate many features on the steering wheel and the park-tronic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We came across the R350 when looking at the GL450. We have two car seats but needed a 3rd row periodically when my parents are staying with us. You can only access the third row from the passenger side in the GL (and most SUV's)which is difficult for my parents. We then looked at the R350 and you can access the rear row even with car seats in the 2nd row,from both sides. The 3rd row are real seats and have very good leg room and child seat anchors if needed. The ride & handling of the car are very good. We also got the P2 package which gave us some great options, mem seats, nav, HK stereo, hands free phone(w/bluetooth) etc. After looking at 6 vehicles, we are thrilled with the R350. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy access, backup camera, navigation and the HK stereo which has 11 speakers, bass, Sirius, 6 disc changer and 450 watts. The hands free phone system with bluetooth module is outstanding! You can operate all of this from the steering wheel!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With the 7 seat option now, if you are in the market for a luxury brand to haul a family of 5 + occasional/regular guests, this is the must have. Having done my share of research on 7- Seater SUVs (MDX, Q7, GL etc.), I am not regretting my decision to buy this "Van or SUV" vehicle at all. I waited for 2 months after hearing about the 7 Seat option before picking up my 2008 R320 CDI on August 29th. We get all the 4WD benefits that the SUVs bring and most of the family comforts of a 7 seater Van including, most importantly, a good rear seat which seats adults and not people under 5' alone. Also, the Mercedes brand has its fair share of luxury inputs to this vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A lot of room inside, great seating expecially the 3rd row. My suggestion, pay the additional $ 1,000 for the Diesel and you will not regret the fewer trips to the gas station. Its a little noisier and slower upto the 20 MPH zone, but after that, you cannot differentiate from a gas engine.</FAVORITE>
