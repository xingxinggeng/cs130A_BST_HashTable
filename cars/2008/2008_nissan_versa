<TEXT>I have a 2008 Versa Hatchback and this is an awesome ride. it has been a year now owning it and had 50,000 + miles on it. to this day I have only taken it in for minor sunroof issues and had my car stereo replaced 2 times now. Handles great but when the wind comes blowing by, Man does that car pull to the sides. I really don't think its getting 30+ MPG. i would say it's more like 25- 29 MPG's. the sound system in it needs to be a lot better than what it has now. my mother has a dakota and the sound system is Great! If its a sport package and needs a better sound system. Other than that it is a great car to drive and my car for traveling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was in a car crash in 2007 with another type of vehicle. I was very concerned about replacing my vehicle. I had to have a safe vehicle with airbags and a proven safety record. My Versa met every requirement that I needed and believe me I spent many hours reading reviews and also looking at all types of vehicles. The Versa had everything I needed and was at a great price. The dealership that I bought from was friendly and they were very patient with me, answered all my questions and realized how much safety was important to me. I love my vehicle and have recommended the Versa to others without hesitation.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first car was a 1985 Nissan Maxima and I ran it to death from the years of 2003-2008 when I bought our Versa. Since then we have had the fuel pump replaced THREE TIMES and it keeps failing. We recently had it replaced but notified Nissan of us declaring lemon when the part breaks again, I just hope I get all the money I put into it as we are a few hundred dollars off from paying the entire 16k we paid for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Everything is great on the vehicle, except the starting problems... has difficulty starting, it takes 2 cranks sometimes (not only in winter, but in all seasons). It has been in the dealership 5 times in the first 12 months I bought it. Nissan Corporation refuses to buy back the vehicle, because the dealership I bought it from keeps on replacing different parts (the dealership also don't report this to CARFAX either (bad dealership)). I am now going to take it to a different Nissan dealership and see what their mechanic says. Nissan has made me miss 5 days of work - not good! I have a manual and I am lucky if I get 27 mpg in the city, I don't drive it hard.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The hatchback can hold a lot of stuff, worth the extra $$$! Nice clutch and stick, very easy to find gears and shift. Great car over all.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I expected more from a nissan. It has been in the shop over 5 times in the first year to fix missing interior part, mysterious cluck in the front steering, air conditioning problem and hard to start at first until a part was replaced. All covered by warranty but that runs out soon and I can't wait to find out what breaks next. I would have rated it lower but my wife is too nice. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I did my research, and discounted the Fit, Yaris etc in favour of the Versa bc of horsepower, room and the Nissan reputation. It exceeded all my expectations at first - fun to drive, reliable, good fuel economy, easy to handle. Then winter hit. In cold, wet weather, I would come out to the car and find ice all over the dash, controls and inside of the windows and windshields. The controls wouldn't work and the doors wouldn't shut. Warming it up - no change. Getting it fixed at the dealer proved extremely problematic ie. didn't happen - cost to me to fix was quoted at $5-10K. I just traded it in for a 2009 model - hoping for better this time around. It'll likely be my last Nissan too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We are looking for a good commuter car and big inside. I don't wanted to buy a SUV, a big gas hug. I need a car that good in gas and roomy inside and big trunk. Specially with two kids. We found this Nissan Versa, I told my husband its very comforting and very roomy inside. We test drive after that we bought the car and I love driving it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is junk. In less than four months my brakes failed. I took to the dealership over and over. Was told nothing was wrong. Last time they kept my car 4 days and did nothing to it. Next day the brakes failed. Very noisy with lots of rattles and squeaks. Windows squeak constantly and never have gotten more than 33 mpg on the hwy. Tire pressure light goes on and off for no reason. Poor handling in tight turns and a popping when turning tightly to the left. I will never buy a Nissan again in my life. I even talked to the Corporate office and was told to take my car to a different dealership to have the brakes looked at and was charged. Had to take car to personal mechanic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very satisfied with this car. After 30,000 miles I have had no problems and gas mileage has been averaging 34.3mpg. I drive mostly in the mountains and small towns. The cvt transmission is the best automatic that I have driven in the mountains. The holdback saves on the brakes and there is no shifting as I navigate these winding mountain roads. The antilock braking system works great in ice and snow. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The cvt transmission is great, unless I have a problem with it I will probably get one on my next vehicle. Keyless entry and bluetooth are nice features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We went looking for a small, reliable car with a/c with a strong preference for a hatchback. We focused on the usual suspects - Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris, Scion whatever, Toyota Matrix/Pontiac Vibe. Then we saw the Versa at a Hertz sales lot, liked it, researched it and could buy it for $3,000 under KBB. Negatives are rear visibility and stability in cross winds. A big positive is roominess whether carrying four people or two people and two bicycles - they fit in all the way without having to take off a wheel. When we bought we would have preferred a Matrix if the money was close to the same. That would have been a mistake.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I first saw this car, I loved the way it looked. After purchasing the car, I love the size of it, how I fit in small spaces, and the way it revs up when you put your foot on the accelerator. It looks smaller outside than it is inside. Also I have a brother in law who is at least 6'4", and he had plenty of room in the back seat. I am a woman of 5'9", and I am so comfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have 3 teenage drivers and this car is perfect for them, and me too. I also like the fact that it is a humble car. No flash, no fuss. Those of us who bought them know we would have spent a lot more on the Corolla, Civic, Fit, etc and had a lot less interior room. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Versa is an economy car in first class cladding. The Versa has more than other cars in its class - larger tires (15"), larger interior space (feels bigger than it is) and good gas mileage. Some say the car is breezy, I don't find it breezy at all. I drive 90 miles each way on my once-a- week commute and find the car solid and comfortable on the interstate. The seats are large and solid and nicely upholstered. Interior looks expensive like a Maxima, way better than our Echo's plasto box interior. Exterior has that funky European styling that we just don't get over here in North America. Engine is capable - a bit buzzy but with the CVT it settles down once up to speed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car a week now and have put 1200 miles on it. It's getting between 30 to 32 mpg with a regular auto trans. I think it will get more when I do my first oil change and switch to Mobil 1 synthetic. The car is quite roomy on the inside and more comfortable than a 2007 Corolla, which I had looked at and rented thru a car rental agency. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It has a lot of airbags in it, stereo is nice, seats are comfortable. Nissan's 3.9 percent financing for 5 years was a selling point.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Good around town runabout. Performance is good for this class of car. The 4 speed auto is to be desired. Lots of foot well space for my size 13s to shift a manual (if I had gotten it). The wife cannot drive stick so auto it is! Not much room for groceries but it does the job for a younger couple starting out. Over 4000rpm the engine gets obnoxious but cruises great in top gear at 2450rpm @60mph. Very quiet inside, not much wind noise etc. It's a bit sloppy on the road in high winds, but descent in the snow. Why is there no temperature gauge?? Come on Nissan! Alternator and most major parts are easily replaceable under the hood for those who plan to own for a long time!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I think the seats are best in class, give excellent support on longer drives. Steering is nicely weighted to give some feedback on what the tires are doing. Back seat space is outstanding. I'm 6'3" 245lbs and can fit with room to spare. It's more of a two place rear seat, not a three.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After copious research I narrowed it down to Honda Fit or Versa, better dealer financing swung it in favor of the Versa. After a month, though, I'm a little hesitant to recommend this little hatchback. Gas mileage has been OK, but not great we've got 21s to 29 depending on how much highway driving we do (this is the CVT model). Driving comfort is the big problem, lumbar support is non-existent, seats are short and no support under thighs. Steering wheel is too far away if you're not ridiculously short. Ride is OK but blows around like a leaf in the wind and doesn't feel well connected to the road (easily drifts). That said, it turned out to be excellent in snow, easy to control and stop.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Intelligent Key is way cool. Upholstery quality. Quiet as long as you're not accelerating. Very good sized interior, especially the superb back seat. Dash is attractively simple. Controls are simple. Convenience Package is well worth it. Usable cupholders galore. Big, deep glove-box.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove the Yaris, Fit, Focus, and the Scion xD. The Versa was not the best driving car, too much oversteer on turns, felt top heavy, and uneven braking, but I felt it was the best value. My 2002 Focus SE handles much better, and gets about the same 30-34 MPG. The 1.8L CVT has better acceleration than my 2.2L Focus, but is noisy at higher RPMs. What sold me on the Versa was its upscale stock interior styling and the roomy back seat. I found only 2 manufacturing defects, a squeak coming from the dash, and the chrome plating on the front Nissan emblem peeling (dealer replaced). Not bad compared to the many defects I found in my Ford Focus when purchased new. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy backseat, 6 CD stock changer, largest trunk area with seats down in it's class, good insurance rating, standard side air bags, comfortable driving position.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am replacing a 2002 Nissan Sentra (which I LOVED) and after test driving several competitors I came back to Nissan. I also drove the mid-level Sentra and the Versa has a much better interior layout. LOVE my bluetooth phone and intelligent key. As a small business owner, this feature is a lifesaver and worth every cent! The ABS upgrade has also paid for itself with a $300 per six months savings on my car insurance over the old Sentra. Car is peppy and ROOMY.. almost like the fabled Tardis.. way bigger inside than it looks! I plan to drive this car for 10 years and think it will be a happy love affair. </TEXT>

Handled very well on the snow and ice, very impressed with the quietness, in fact just yesterday a passenger in my car didn't believe the engine was still running 'til I pulled away!! Half a tank of gas will see me over 200 miles (driv to work is 30 miles highway 15 miles city). Fun to drive, responsive and spacious, after driving a V8 truck for years didn't expect to like it that much outstanding value for money!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We love our new Nissan. We're getting 38 miles to the gallon. On our 07 we got 40 mpg and we haven't even broken this one in yet. What a differance color really does make. The 07 was black, didn't have all the amenities that my husband wanted, so we traded it in for an 08. This one is white, just what he wanted with the sunroof, xm radio, and all the additional pkgs. you can get. Life is too short, might as well get what he really wants. For a big-little car, for running around, it the greatest we found it so comfortable, we use it for road trips too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable the seats are and the roominess of my Versa, as well as how well it rides and responds to my foot. The car rides and responds like a much bigger car. They could have placed the side mirror controls in a better location so that you do not have to bend and reach to make adjustments.

<TEXT>Test drove the CVT, my 6 speed is much more responsive and quiet. Fuel economy is great at 32 city-35 hwy. Drove a lot in Denver recently- consistent 32 mpg. Very happy with the options chosen with the S (cruise, power package), and equally happy with the price. Test drove Corolla and Civic. The Versa and the options I wanted would have cost me much more in the other (more well known) models. Insurance is also cheaper! The Versa is much more comfortable and fun to drive. Wish there was an arm rest... small price to pay. A lot of space in such a small sedan. Handles well on ice and snow. Great car! </TEXT>

<TEXT>After 3 months, I continue to be very happy with the Versa. I enjoy the extras (MP3 plug-in, etc.), but the basics of the car are great (ie: automatic tire pressure warning). I get 25-30 mpg depending if I have been using the AC. No problems driving in the recent snow. It's no sportscar, but I definitely notice good pick-up off the lights compared to almost all other sedans on the road. Overall, a great value. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning my fair share of Honda Civics, I decided it was time for a change. I wanted something that was good on gas and comfortable at a price that wouldn't break the bank. I test drove a Mazda3, Ford Focus & Hyundai Elantra before settling on the Versa. I'm 100% satisfied with my decision. While an "economy" car, the Versa SL doesn't lack in quality. The quality of the interior fabric is superb. It's easy to clean & durable. All controls are placed logically & are easily accessible. The CVT is smooth and quiet. Love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Convenience Pkg w/ Bluetooth Technology, so no need to dig through your purse or pockets for your keys or cellphone PLUS audio controls mounted on steering wheel; fold down arm rest w/ cupholders in back seat (unusual for a car in this class) ; 6-disc changer standard on SL; great legroom throughout.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Own this for 2 months. This car has a great "French" ride similar to an old Renault R-10 I used to own... nice! The 6 speed shifts terrific but the gearing and clutch take a little getting used to. Seats are very comfortable. Controls for major functions are nicely laid out and instrument panel is well lit. This car rides very smooth and quiet for its class, and the price can't be beat for the features. Seating room front & back is MUCH larger than most compact cars. The hatch's 'trunk' is deceivingly large. I love the looks of the car except for the nose... looks like a tiny, Quest van. Gas mileage in mostly stop & go, suburban rush hour traffic is about 28 so far. I really like it :-)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Extremely quiet & smooth ride. Large versatile interior space & legroom front & back. Large hatchback 'trunk' area. Decent gas mileage vs size & ride comfort. Dashboard lighting & ease of dash controls. Keyless entry w/alarm, tilt, cruise, AC, PW, PL, PM, decent stock CD, side airbags for under $15k</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having purchased the Versa three weeks ago, I have to say I am impressed. Having to commute 72 mi a day, I am getting 30 miles to the gallon. My vehicle now has 800 miles on it. Having a manual, and owning three prior autos with manual transmission including Toyota Corolla, I have to say that for the price, the Versa is well worth it. The only drawback which I am getting used to is in regards to shifting. There is very little room for error in shifting from second to third as well as from fifth to fourth gear. There is plenty of headroom in the drivers seat as well as plenty of room in the rear. If you're looking for a reduced priced subcompact. I would recommend the Versa over the Corolla. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned my 2008 hatchback for almost 2 months. Drives great and lots of room. I trust Nissan and know they make excellent cars. So far there are 3 undesirable issues. One is that the wheels have very cheap hub caps. One of mine came flying off while I was driving. It's a piece of junk these covers! Also the cup holders are in a horrible location. I had to install a cup tray (from a conversion van) on the dash in the middle. And finally do not buy this car without the power option. A huge mistake. Power locks should be standard but they are not. You will regret it w/o the power package. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Versa S sedan, manual trans, with the Power Package is more than enough car for our family of young drivers. The car shifts smoothly, rides nice for a small car, and has much more interior leg room in the back seat than many mid size cars. The trunk space is surprisingly large too. The dash has a nice look. I believe this vehicle will gain a lot of sales momentum as it priced so competitively and has so much to offer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Except for its somewhat unattractive front end styling, it disappears when you get yourself behind the driver's seat. Yup, it's no pocket rocket, but the CVT gets it up to speed sooner than you can tell "Bluetooth" which number you wish to dial. The ride is smooth with good road feedback. Quieter than other more expensive vehicles. I've had my share of Porsches, Corvettes, and everything in between. Nissan has put some serious thought into the making of this vehicle, and what it has to offer. The Versa proves that an inexpensive car doesn't have to be made cheaply. With ridiculous gas prices these days, I'd buy it again. </TEXT>

I am really pleased with my purchase and feel that compared to other cars in its class/price range, I did really well!! I also test drove Fit and Rabbit.

<TEXT>Overall, a great car. Nice appearance ? both the exterior and interior. The interior has a nice ?futuristic? feel to it (not over the top) and is exceptionally spacious (back seat okay for adults). Mixed fuel economy has returned an impressive 30 ? 33 mpg (albeit mostly highway). The CVT is wonderful ? it offers seamless shifting (I?ll never settle for a conventional automatic again?). Ample acceleration (no sports car however). Great features for an "entry-level". Why buy an SUV, like the Honda CR-V my wife and I traded in, when you can have effectively the same interior space, much better fuel economy, in a less expensive package? </TEXT>

<TEXT>We've had the car a week now and just love it. It's a lot smaller than our minivan, but it gets a whole lot better gas mileage too! Our temps have been in the high 90s and 100s and I run the A/C each time I drive. Barely moves the gas gauge ! We love the style of the car, the inside is comfy, CVT is great, audio system is wonderful, and bluetooth is a great safety feature. I'm glad we have ABS and all the air bags too... that really saved on our car insurance. The ride is very smooth. We think it takes bumps well. All in all, I'd rate this car a 9.5 out of 10.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Right now western Canadians are paying about $1.10 per litre ($4.15 per gallon) for regular unleaded. I was paying about $400.00 per month in fuel alone driving my restored cutlass supreme. I needed something to save money, fast! Apples to apples the Versa is the best quality in its class with a lot of bragging rights in the category! Love it, love it, love it! I thought I was going to hate a compact car because I drive a 300+ hp car and a new crotch rocket, but this car has a lot of pep! The 1.8L engine is matched beautifully to the 6 speed manual. I tried the cvt, liked it, but the 6 speed was way too much for an enthusiast like me to pass up! Nissan, you've made a believer out of me!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy!!! Not as good as advertised, but okay. 6 cd in-dash stereo with MP3!! I packed it full of burnt MP3 cds (all legal of course *lol*) I'll be listening to those cds untill I'm 90, without listening to the same song twice!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a Hyundai Santa Fe on this car back when the gas prices skyrocketed. I was told I would get 35 mpg. Not. I gave up many extras that I had on the Santa Fe (heated seats, leather interior, etc.) Not worth it. I drive 42 miles round trip to work 5 days a week and get about 28 mpg. I make a 5-6 trips from Cincy to Columbus (about 200 miles) and only get 29-30 mpg. This may not seem like a lot but I would have been better off with the Hyundai, it was paid off. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a modestly equipped Versa as an extremely economical choice. It was the most affordable 5-door that wasn't too small, but I was dissatisfied overall. A mediocre suspension, poor 6-speed shifter and unsupportive seats made an unrefined ride. Mine got poorer than average MPG despite a light foot. The brakes squeaked from the first day and were never repaired to my satisfaction. Nissan even distributed a note to dealerships to excuse themselves from this problem. In other words: Versas squeak. Too bad. If you want a low cost Nissan, buy the Cube instead.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got sick of driving my BMW 325 in the snow, and then got sick of fixing my Volvo, so I sucked it up and bought a commuter car. I have always been a fan of Nissan reliability -- have had several over many years. I now drive 25k a year. I have put 34k on this car, and it runs the same as the day I bought it. There was a minor vibration at 3000 RPM that was easily repaired (air conditioning insulation was vibrating). I have done all the scheduled maintenance. I recommend that. I am of the mind set that if this car is maintained correctly, it will last a long time. Is it fun to drive like a Euro car? NO! But it is reasonably quiet, handles okay, and slow as molasses. Overall I am happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Recently bought my Versa SL preowned with 5000 miles on it. Prior to buying the car I drove similar cars from Toyota, Hyundai, Honda, VW, Ford. The thing that sets the Versa apart from these other cars is the super low interior noise level and seamless transmission shifting provided by the CVT. I also noticed a lower level of engine vibration or "buzziness" that's sometimes transmitted through the accelerator pedal or steering wheel of 4 cylinder cars. The car has a much more solid feel to it than the Ford Focus. The doors sound solid when they are closed, you can tell the car is put together well. As back seats go, this car has a very roomy rear seating area for a small car. Nice little car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased this Nissan Versa in April, 2008 as a commuter vehicle. I have a 64 mile round trip daily commute. I have had the Versa back four time to the dealership. Once for highway mileage that is only 27 mpg. The other three times have been for roof or door leaks. All have been part of warranty coverage, with free loaners to use during work. My floors are slopping wet and have been wet more than half of the eight months I have owned the vehicle. The last time I noticed wetness was after a free car wash that my dealership offers with each oil change. Living in Maine, a wet vehicle means frozen interiors to your windows each morning.

<TEXT>I have gotten into 5 different wrecks in the past year and most if not all having to do with my blind spots on the left and right sides of the vehicle. I have noticed that the head rest cushioning has already started to come undone and also the lining to my back right window is coming undone which is letting water seep through. The biggest thing though is that just recently I found myself stranded at 3 in the morning with my car not wanting to crank. After getting it towed, the mechanic informed me that it was my fuel injectors flooding my engine. He said it was a flaw due to the manufacturing and would not be surprised if I would need to do it again in 40,000 miles. That job cost me $325.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted a vehicle comparable to my 2004 Pontiac Vibe which has 110,000 miles and has been perfectly reliable. I also wanted a vehicle that is smoother and quieter than the Vibe, which I still love despite noisy and expensive tires. The Versa fills the bill, is a little more maneuverable and takes less effort to drive. Visibility is a little better too. Fuel economy is comparable, Versa being better in the city and the Vibe slightly better on the highway. For me the Versa is plenty quick (like the Vibe). I like the quiet, the Blue Tooth, the jack in the ratio that lets me use my $30 XM radio. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Mine is an SL with the tech and sport packages (i.e., every option available) So far I am very impressed with my Versa. I cross-shopped this car with the Fit, Rondo, Yaris, VW City Golf (Canada-only model) and even the Mazda 3. in the end it was between this and the Fit. I chose the Versa because it had a better interior and was better value for money. So far (~4000 miles) nothing has gone wrong and there hasn't even been the customary "mysterious new car dash squeak." It feels like I'm driving a high quality product and not an econobox. The CVT takes a bit of getting used to, but it really suits this engine and doesn't feel bogged down like the 4 spd auto in my '04 Sentra. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent quality interior for this class, even better than some more expensive cars. The 280 watt 7-speaker stereo sounds as good as my surround sound at home.

<TEXT>I have had my Versa since July and I love it! I added a few extras (tinted windows/window visors/moonroof) to make it less geeky. I'm very happy with the fuel economy - went from owning a SUV that got 12-15 mpg to my Versa averaging 30 mpg (city driving mostly). The interior is surprisingly big - we have 2 boys and they have plenty of room in the back! The cargo space is adequate as well. It's fun to drive and easy to park in tight spots. I mostly do city/town driving but have taken my Versa on long trips as well and am very happy with the comfort and the 34 mpg I got! For a car that was well under $20,000 for all the great features, it was well worth the $$.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car purchased strictly for economical driving to ranches on good highways. Cruise control very important accessory. Cruise control is the worst I have ever experienced. Resume mode is a joke. Driving on normal highways in flat South Texas is nightmare. Any little bump or slight incline causes cruise control to downshift from 2800 RPMs to 4200 RPMs. Nissan will not fix. Mileage poor because of cruise control (28-30 average).</TEXT>

Not sure if that is the series or extra purchase. Gets about 30 mpg, city/highway combined. Got 35 mpg highway at 85 mph in Colorado, Washington on a trip to see my son. Has had a few hiccups, fuel regulator causes you to turn key three or four times to start while pressure builds, fixed under warranty, tire pressure sensor goes off for right rear tire but so slow a leak dealer cant find it, steering wheel made a scuffing sound when turned lock to lock. Overall very satisfied, 11,000 miles already, fun to drive, good mpg.</TEXT>

Power is good, although engine gets a bit "wound up" on heavy acceleration. Engine calms down when you get to freeway speed. Getting 20-28 MPG combined (I have a heavy foot). Interior space is very good, even for those tall people riding in the back. Sport Package dressed up the car nice. Well built and tight.

I am just hopping the mileage can be better, but there is always a balance comparing mileage and power.

This was my budget and anything extra I considered a luxury I didn't really need.

<TEXT>Considered a Toyota Yaris first, then a Honda Fit, but both were thousands of dollars more than the Versa. A fantastic buy for the price with AC and CD, radio player. Just like Nissan's TV add says, "A lot for a little".</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plenty of room for a family of 5 with 3 car seats in the back. Gas mileage is good. On a road trip, I did go 250 miles on half a tank with AC on, on the freeway. Another time I got 425 miles on one tank, city and freeway driving. Plenty of cargo space for luggage, strollers, and play pen.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My biggest complaint is the gas mileage. After 8000+ miles I'm getting 24 city and 30 highway. Nowhere near what it's rated at and I've checked it repeatedly. Knowing that now I'm not sure I would by this car if I had it to do over again. We have two teenage sons and need a big back seat and this car has it. How is it that Nissan can put in Blue Tooth and a Smart key but can't put in a compass/temp read out. Haven't had any problems with the car so far, if it stays that way I'll forget about the gas mileage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased my new Nissan Versa in June of 2007 and I love it. It is fun to drive, it is very comfortable and gets great gas mileage. This is my first new car and I know I made a great choice. I did a lot of comparison shopping with other manufacturers and I feel like, with the options I got, I got more for my money than I would have if I would have purchased a different make.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My car has the integrated bluetooth which works wonderfully (especially that the cell phone laws have changed) and I love the auxiliary plug in for my mp3 player.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I sold my Prius to take advantage of the ca hov sticker value. Bought the versa as a "bridge" car until the electric hybrid comes along (hopefully). Am not disappointed. Am getting about 30 mpg combined, which is good as I drive a lot of country and hilly roads. Quiet ride. Love that the seats go flat for hauling items. Got it loaded for under 12,000. Did well in the high mountains on a recent road trip - enough power to feel confident on a crowded freeway. BASIC interior inoffensive. Negatives - need more storage spaces in front and cup holders are cramped. Radio is difficult to tune to new stations. That's about it. Wish it got 45 mpg... Ah, well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I never though the day would come that I would contemplate buying a compact car; but with 4-5 dollar gas it's a no brainer. With a negative mindset for compact cars I set out shopping. I wanted fuel economy, but I also wanted comfort and style. As a third car at home I didn't want to pay more than 13-14K for the car. Basic transportation! After looking at Kias. Toyotas, Hyundais and some comparable GM models, I went to see the Nissan Versa. I found all that I was looking for in this little car. At 6'2" tall I found the car easy to get in and out of. You do not feel like you are driving a "compact" with the Versa. Plenty of power and good looks. Great fit and finish.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior space and comfort. Five people can travel comfortably in this car. Great AC system. Great hatch back setup, with the rear seats down we can get our groceries in just like the Explorer we use to drive. 31/33 MPG observed and computed 4 times since purchased.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second review. I have almost 5K miles on my Versa. A couple of things that I've noticed in comparing the Versa to the 2001 Honda Civic that it replaced are that the dash rattles over even the slightest bump and it appears that Nissan does not have the same attention to detail or quality of materials that Honda appears to have. I have gotten as high as 39 miles/gallon; the Civic got 43-45 on the highway in the summer. The Versa rear windows go all the way down, the Civic's don't. The Versa seats are more comfortable and the ride is not as brutal as the Civic. The tire pressure sensor is useless and comes on for no apparent reason. Reliability is still a question. </TEXT>

Now our other SUV stays parked and we only use the Versa. Great car nice and roomy fits all four of us and the dog with no problem. The trunk is roomy but not big enough when grocery shopping.

<TEXT>Nissan Versa 4dr hatchback, CVT + cruise control & Bluetooth technology. Very roomy and comfortable car for long distance trips. Heavier by 500 pounds than YARIS/ECHO. Big+ on highway, on a windy day. Extremely stable car. Interior well finished, sound system good. Points: cable opening hood broke on my 3rd try. Air conditioning made noise, had to be emptied and refilled with proper level of refrigerant. Frustration with bluetooth compatibility.

<TEXT>I had driven a 2002 BMW 5-series for about 2 years prior to purchasing the Nissan Versa. Taking a new job 25 miles away- I couldn't afford premium gas at 20 mpg anymore. I reluctantly started looking at "bubble cars." The Versa had reviewed well, so I gave it a shot. I have had this vehicle for about 6 months now, and I am so happy with every aspect of it. I am constantly amazed with how comfortable, well built, and roomy it is. You'd be surprised what you can fit into that little bugger! I drive about 50 miles a day in commute, and I love everything about the car. Good gas mileage and seemingly engineered for me! Golf clubs fit well in the back- cargo area is big enough to fit everything.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>With the base model starting so cheap, you can get an SL +all options for under $20,000. I love the sunroof/moon-roof and the satellite radio. Every person who rides in the back says how roomy it is. Far and away my favorites are the "keyless" ignition and bluetooth speaker phone, I use it everyday.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove a Scion xD and a Honda Fit before this one, and I fell in love immediately with the Versa. It's amazingly roomy, drives very smoothly at highway speeds (compared to other cars in it's class) and is cute but not too cute like the Fit and Yaris are. I get good gas mileage, about 34 mpg with 60% highway 40% city driving. The model I bought has neat extras like audio and cruise controls on the steering wheel, armrest, etc. My fiancee loves how roomy it is, and I can fit both our bikes in the back easily. I think this is an underrated little car and a GREAT value!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I originally purchased this vehicle as a means to lower my fuel costs ? my main vehicle was an F-350 diesel, and I commute 70 miles each day. In 18 months I would then turn it over to my daughter to drive. Since February, I have put just short of 9000 miles on the car (will put about 20,000 per year I am guessing), including a 16 hour (each way) trip to Reno NV (from Denver) without overnighting. That is a long time in a car, and I was surprised how comfortable it was. Plenty of power, excellent handling, and I averaged over 35 mpg on the trip at 75 mph set on the cruise control. I would not only recommend this car, I may buy another one in 18 months and keep this one for myself! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I generally look at a number of things prior to buying a new car. The Versa was the best combination of price and features that I found. The Versa transmission (6 speed) is smooth and easy to use. The final drive ratio should be about 300 rpm lower at 70 mph. I am not sure what possessed Nissan when they designed this. I agree, the center armrest is needed. I ordered one in and added it myself. I am getting mileage from 31 -38. I am a conserative steady drive. Nice car in general, doesn't attract attention.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car. I drove the Honda Fit, the Toyota Yaris, the Suzuki SX4, and the Nissan Versa won hands down. It's a great car. Has a lot of interior room. The Versa has tons of room and I can straighten my leg all the way out, which is great when you are commuting 2 hours round trip a day. The mileage is great. I'm getting 33 MPG and It's not even broken in yet. Very quiet ride (w/windows closed) and does great at highway speeds of 70 MPH. It feels stable and solid. Has a big car feel to it. The others felt like scary go-carts at high speeds.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature is the cruise control. Wouldn't buy a car without it. Also like the way the cruise is set up on the stearing wheel. Very easy to access. The car also has great pick up. It has quite a surprising amount of power for a small gas efficient car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've driven the Fit, Scions, Focus, Corolla, Yaris and Civic and I have to say that I like the Versa the best. The Corolla, Yaris and Civic all are well made cars, but for me the Versa had the smoothest ride/acceleration (CVT) and best interior. The layout of the controls was top notch. Also you sit up higher in the seat so you have a better view of what's up ahead. The keyless feature seemed like no big deal at first, but when your hands are full, you don't need to fumble in your pockets for the key. It's a pretty neat feature. However, what people like is so personal to them that I think you need to drive all the aforementioned cars to decide what is right for you. Good luck!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Driving the Versa made it easy to economize and transition from an 04' Maxima SL in both cost and comfort. I wanted a more fuel efficient car and spent weeks researching the Honda Civic/Fit, Toyota Corolla, Nissan Senta/Versa, Chevrolet Aveo, and Ford Focus. After test driving the Civic, Focus, Corolla and Sentra, I chose Versa with ABS. It's amazingly peppy with easy steering and great turning radius. It offers the most room of any of cars I drove and is just as comfortable as the Maxima. There is plenty of rear room for grandchildren's car seats without adjusting front seats. The difference in the payments, gas costs and insurance saves me nearly $4,000 over the next 20 months.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far, I love the car. It's onyx blue with beige interior. It had about 16 miles on the odometer. I've put about 300 miles on it driving to and back from work on the freeway. Feels very upscale for an "econo-class" car. I chose the Versa after test driving three different versions (Manual, Auto, and Sports Auto with paddle shifter) of the Honda Fit. I found the Fit nimble but has too much of an "econo-car" feel to it. Plus the CVT and the Inteligent Key on the Versa are a couple of the many awesome "upscale" things that I appreciate every time I drive my Versa. I couldn't ask for more for the price that Nissan is selling it for.</TEXT>

<TEXT>At 6'4" & 240 lbs, I actually fit in the Versa. The seat is a bit short for my long legs & not quite wide enough to accomodate my wide hips. My wife is 6' & the seats fit her fine. You can haul 2 six footers in the back without them feeling cramped. The Versa handles fine but the suspension is a bit choppy on rough roads. The Versa feels underbraked but I've been driving 1 ton & 3/4 ton trucks for 25 years so I am used to strong brakes. My first tank of fuel in all city driving yielded 27 mpg. At 2,000+ miles I am up to 29 mpg in the city. On a recent trip with a 700 lb payload & running 75 mph, I averaged 31.5 mpg. Versa's my first compact car & I would buy another. Lots of room for a compact!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven many, many vehicles. The Versa is a perfectly balanced car. You get a lot of bang for your buck, plus my family of four fits comfortably. The styling is cute, particularly with the rear spoiler (hatchback). Gas mileage is great. I was driving a Jeep Cherokee and that thing was killing my wallet. The Versa also sits so that I don't feel too low to the pavement. There is great visibility. Even though from the outside it looks small, it doesn't feel small on the inside. The body lines are like the Quest minivan, but I'm too cool to drive one of those. :) There are two other people in my family that have Versas and I think that everyone should. You should test drive today!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove the Honda Fit and Nissan Versa numerous times before making up my mind. I chose the Versa and I am extremely happy that I did. It feels substantial, looks good and the CVT, Intelli key and Blue tooth hands free are awesome. The trunk is small but the ride is smooth and quiet. The engine tends to "lug" a bit when cruising around 30 mph but smooths out quickly when gas is applied. The engine sound is "buzzy" during quick accelerations but quiets right down. MPG so far is 26.44 but that is strictly around town driving (hardly ever over 50). Overall so far, I love it. I added a very light weight trailer so the small trunk isn't an issue plus I can now haul larger stuff to the dump</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an added review to the one I wrote on 12/10/07. I mostly use my Versa as a daily commuter in stop & go suburban rush hour traffic and get about 28 mpg. I just took it on its first 200 mile trip up and down the Berkshire Mountains of Ma on a major highway and was more than pleased to see that I got 36 mpg with cruise set @ 72 mph with the 6M. The ride was comfortable and quiet although the narrow, tall stature of this car causes crosswinds to play with it a little bit. Nothing terrible though. I still miss not having a center console. The only annoyance I had was the low pressure tire sensors misbehaving in the extreme cold. No problems though. Still love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A lot for a little, room, smooth/quiet/comfortable for a car of this class, good mileage for a large-little car. Much better than expected highway mileage. Good in snow especially stopping (without abs). Everything else still holds true from my first review. This is a great car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This was the first car I test-drove after getting my license and so far, I do not regret my decision. I wanted a no-frills, simple car, and the Versa was that plus a bit more. I was also looking for something to carry around people comfortably, and the Versa does just the trick; I even find myself wanting to sit in the back seat to indulge in all the room. The interior layout and controls are nice, everything I need while driving is within easy reach. Performance-wise, the Versa meets my needs. I have to keep reminding myself it's not a sports car, but with some consideration on my part, it does what I need it to do. Street and highway driving are a breeze. Fuel economy is decent.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seating: As I mentioned already quite comfortable and plentiful. I also like the abundance of air bags, makes me feel just a bit safer driving around.

The fact that it drives and feels nothing like an economy car is icing on the cake.The interior is amazingly roomy and comfortable for a small car and a lot quieter than I expected, almost a Mausoleum compared to my old Neon. Incredible room in the back seat and more than enough cargo space. The Versa's space efficiency is truly amazing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my versa in on March 12, 08 and had an issue with the brakes rotors needing to be turned due to vibrations. This was repaired next available date I could get it in. I have about 3600 miles on it an started to have hard starts, taking 10-30 sec. to start. Thought it was bad gasoline but ended up being Fuel Pressure Sensor. Just had that repaired and continue to enjoy this car. Getting 30-32mpg consistently. The CVT takes some getting use to but the selling point was no maint. for 150K miles or more. Lots of interior room but black seats show lots of dirt when you have kids. Needs more 12 volt outlets. Comeon Nissan its the 21st century! Overall I am very happy with car.Enjoy</TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at all of the new small cars including the Yaris, Fit, Corolla, etc. For me, the Versa had the best mix of interior space, mileage, and price. The CVT is the best transmission I've ever driven; it is smooth. If you drive the Versa with a light foot, it keeps the engine RPMs down below 2000 and makes for a quiet car and gas mileage of 30+. The back seat of this car is the real highlight. Being 6' 2", I can drive the car and still have 2 happy adults in the back seat. Nissan clearly traded off some luggage room for a larger back seat. The Bluetooth phone feature works perfectly with my Blackberry. It pairs automatically. The Intelligent Key is also a great feature!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Versa is a comfortable ride, it averages at about 30.5 MPG mixed city and highway. I have had it for three months, and just about two weeks ago the engine doesn't start every time I turn the key. This is a bit frustrating since I just bought the car in January. It doesn't handle extremely well and it blows around in the wind a bit. It is extremely roomy, and has a good sound system, and is a nice cruising vehicle. Overall (if this engine starting problem gets straightened out) I love the Versa, it is the first new car I have bought, and the second car I have owned.

It's sporty and classy and just an all around great deal. I am lucky enough to have some nice added features such as the power package, and rear spoiler, and I just tinted the windows yesterday. And it really looks sharp! If you're shopping for an economy car that if veritile, and sporty, this is it! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Miles per gallon, plenty of cup holders for all passengers, very spacious front and rear passengers, and most important, I can still get a road bike or mountain bike inside w/plenty of ease.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have 13,000 miles on this car. The average MPG is 29.71 for all miles driven. The average for level freeway with cruise control and observing the posted limit is 27.22 MPG. The only reason I get 29.71 MPG is because I drive some hills on my normal commute and I coast whenever possible. I also coast to stops in neutral to maximize fuel economy. My other car a 2000 Saturn SW2 which has a 1.9L DOHC engine gets 34 MPG average since it was new 314000 miles ago. The Versa has been to the dealer 3 times; twice for minor issues and today for a CV boot replacement (clamp missing from original boot). The cruise control has an annoying habit of speeding up and slowing down when going down hill.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear seat leg room and headroom. Safety features with lots of airbags and even active headrests to reduce whiplash. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Went to the Nissan dealership and asked for their lowest priced car. What I got was a no-frills 6-speed manual Versa. I had to drive it back from the dealership's other site about 30 miles away. A great test drive and I didn't expect to love it as much as I did. I've only had it for a few days now and have to concur with all the other reviews. It's a great car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mucho space inside, exceptional interior appointments, nice stereo, etc. </FAVORITE>
