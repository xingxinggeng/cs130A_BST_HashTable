<TEXT>I bought my Optima last year when gas was nearing $4/gal. I drive a lot of miles so I sold my 475hp 12mpg Hemi Ram and bought the KIA. I had rented one in the past and was pleasantly surprised so I decided to give it a try. I've had it a year now, and have put over 40,000 miles on it already. There have been NO major problems, in fact I've not been back to the dealership for any reason. I change the oil and rotate the tires religiously but that's it. Would I recommend one to a friend? Hell, yes! Would I buy another one? Absolutely!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable, VERY cold A/C (important in Florida), great mileage, and for some unknown reason Love Bugs do not stick to the paint, they wash right off! Go figure.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased the base Optima, 4 cyl., 5 speed manual. A lot of car for the money, purchased new last month, 6/2009, for $10,995! Sweet deal. Had 10 miles, now have 300, first tank of gas I received on 18 mpg! Mostly in town, getting use to manual transmission again! Previous review complained about passenger doors not operating from driver side. Turn key once to the right to unlock driver door, twice to unlock all doors! Small price to pay for an inexpensive, quality built vehicle! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks! Like the style, love the spacious interior and trunk. Lots of standard features for a base model!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have a new H3, a 6yr old Sunfire, and an 08 Dodge Avenger (son). Needed a new smaller, more economical car for vacations now that both of us are retired. Looked at all of them in the one-year-old under $15000 range. I wanted another Avenger which son loves, but wife not comfortable in the seat. Ended up getting this 2008 Optima as a former Enterprise car. Absolutely LOVE IT. Wanted a four, but settled on a six, but the power is amazing -whiplash acceleration -and the economy on three fill ups has been 34, 34, 38 on combined interstate and city driving. The four could not have done much better. It has all the toys like steering wheel radio controls. Only had it 1 mo. So far VERY PLEASED!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering Wheel radio controls. trip computer. ENORMOUS leg room in the front - I'm 6' and cannot reach the floorboard behind the pedals. Third headrest in rear and rear armrest.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently rented an Optima for a week trip. It was by far the most enjoyable car I have ever driven..I recently dumped my Mercedes AMG last month for numerous ongoing problems. The Optima was responsive, comfortable, quick acceleration and the gas mileage exceeded 30 mpg on the highway. I am planning to buy one in the next 30 days. I understand that one week is not the same as owning, but I was that impressed with the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A general perception with so many appealing ads on TV,people seem to be just convinced with brands like Toyota camry,Honda,Nissan.I have reviewed and test drived all of above but with their brand name,car seems too very expensive.Happened to try a Kia Optima and never had to give it a 2nd thought.With the price,safety features,mileage i rate this very much in par with Toyota honda nissan.Initially when i bought few asked me-Y did u go for a Kia,but whn i took them for a ride they had a different view altogether which made me so proud.classy sharp looks,smooth silent ride,responsive engine. Im glad i own a Gorgeous midnight metallic grey KIA OPTIMA.Mwaaah & a pat well tht goes to my car </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my jeep grand cheokee when gas was killing my budget from a 100 mile daily work trip. The car runs great a it very comfortable I also have gotten about 460 miles to the 16 gallon tank as oposed to 250 in the jeep. I have two kids a dog and a wife and take frequet trips in the car and its comfortable for all of us. The head room is great due to the fact I am 6-3 . The only down side I have is the gas petal is a little jerky and the aceleration is a little weak.Over all it is the best money I have spent on a car.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Replaced &#039;01 w/ &#039;08</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Bought my 2008 EX V6 Optima in June 2008...replaced my 2001 with the same thing because I loved it so much. KIA has the best roadside assistance and warranty. I paid a pretty penny for it ($22K), but left out no features. With my annual mileage averaging 5,000- 6,000, my 10 years will be up before the 100,000 miles on the warranty. And yes, I will keep it that long! People always take a second look at my car when I am driving. It's a sharp- looking vehicle, and it is just as reliable as the Camry and Accord (although NOTHING can beat a Toyota or Honda). I will always by KIA's because both of my Optimas have proven to be reliable. Love our Sedona minivan, too. Foreign is the only way to go.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tiptronic Auto-manual, HEATED SEATS, 1- click open sunroof, 6-disc changer, heated mirrors, dual chrome exhaust. 4- wheel ABS, 10 airbags (including side- curtain above windows), and standard electronic stability control save a TON on insurance. 5-star safety rating. Overall a nice car!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first new car, and I would have to say I made the right choice. This car provides all around safety, convenience, and just the right amount of sport as well. All of this is available at the right price. I believe this car is entirely too underrated. It drives tight, the infinity sound system sounds great, the controls are easy to follow, and it goes. The only problem is that it says Kia. People ask me what I own. All I can say is let me take you for a ride and ill prove that this car is awesome.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Before this car I owned a 2007 Ford Focus. I had it for two years and decided I wanted something bigger. I went to the dealership just to price. Test drove the car and bought it on the spot. At first I thought that I had made a bad decision, after I had it for a few weeks I was glad I had bought it. The interior it awesome. Just don't like that lint sticks to the seats all the time. But besides that it is awesome. Was the best buy that I have ever made.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The fact that I can plug my iPhone and mp3 playing in to the car. The a/c is very cold and the heater is awesome as well. The auto headlights are great for me as well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Took it home and took it right back the next morning. It came off the truck with a bad alignment. Pulled to the right. It took about 6-8 days to fix. I asked where is my car? Oh it's at Nissan. What Nissan? yeah, they have the alignment machine. I'm like why don't the kia dealer have the equipment necessary to support the warranty? The salesmen asked me do I know how much that cost like i cared. The car has been great since i got it back. 1800 mi now. Took the family to Bolxi, MS and it did fine. Gas mileage great compared to my 6.0 L silverado. With $3000 cash back i walked out the door for LX model $14,600</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned the 2008 Kia Optima for a few weeks now. I understand it may take a while to break in a new car and improve gas mileage. So far I am averaging between 26 and 30 mpg. Highway of course is outstanding. I am overall happy with my purchase. Its somewhat of an adjustment coming down from a Toyota Avalon. However, I am very happy with the balance between luxury and economy in the Kia. The interior and exterior appearance are definitely luxury. The ride and price is definitely economy. So keep that in mind. The experience buying the car was excellent. The best way to work is to put a small deposit on your car, and write up the Purchase and sale, then shop 2-3 dealers. Happy days!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I agree with Kia's slogan. I was planning to replace my well worn out 91 Honda Accord with another Accord or Camry. I then saw the commercial for the Optima stating a price $3000 less than a Camry or Accord plus a $3000 rebate. This grabbed my attention so I went to see what Kia was all about. And I was surprised. Kia has done a nice job of building a sound car with features only found on higher end cars. I already have 3500 miles on it in two months. My mileage has steadily increased with each fill from 27 mpg to 29.5 for my driving. The car is quiet and shifts smooth (although a bit too frequently). We'll see what I think after 100,000 miles but so far I am impressed. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auto temp control, audio controls on the steering wheel, low road and engine noise. Not sure if I will like the tire pressure monitoring system. We'll see if there are any problems when I put on a new set of tires.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I sold my Corolla and was looking to find a great replacement. Well, enough said. This is a great car. It can carry four people very comfortably. However, economy is a hard pill to swallow. I am averaging 21 mpg and this is taking some getting used to. My corolla averaged 28 mpg. I thought this was a problem with the vehicle but turns out that after reading other reviews this is normal. Overall I am pleased.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As with many people my bias toward Kia was negative based on second hand knowledge of prior year models BUT Wow, I am so far amazed. I gave the car a 9/10 on Interior only because I feel the plushness of the cloth seat fabric does not fully live up to the quality level of this car. I am impressed with how this car measures up to my test drives in similar Lexus, Toyota, Volvo, and Mazda vehicles. Sweet! The cabin is solid and quite. Rear seat leg room and comfort beyond expectation. Ride, Steering, and Handling ... ahhhh ... so good. Love the Deep Sea Blue paint. Trunk - Deep & Wide. Standard sound system, pretty darn good, and that's VERY important to me. A/C works very well even in Texas.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Though the car has electric locks, the other doors do not automatically unlock when I open the driver or passenger door with the key. It is so quite inside that I can't hear the engine running and sometimes stall the car (M/T). Wish seatbelt shoulder point went higher.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With the exceptions of the following. Hard seats, blind spots, cheesy interior door handles, misleading mpg, it is a great little car. Known'n then what I know now, I would have never traded my overly-dependable 1989 olds 98 that delivered a honest 31 mpg & more comfort & mpg than Kia ever thought possible. Bottom line is like the car but I loved my olds! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned Hondas, Camrys, and other trendy cars in the past, but this is by far the best in terms of safety, price, and smooth riding. I love this car! Too bad people think it's a cheap car b/c of the name brand, but it's very reliable, rides smoothly, very safe 5 star-crash safety testing, 6 airbags, double safety bars on doors, etc. This car is by far better than any Honda, Camry, or Nissan in terms of gas mileage, price, warranty and safety. I highly recommend it to anyone buying a new car. You can't beat the warranty. I got free oil changes for 80K miles:) </TEXT>

<TEXT>I really thought about buying an Accord or a Camry, you know image is important. Well, I could not get over how much better the Optima was compared to the other image cars. The optima rode better, looked sharp, (I have the appearance pkg) and was thousands less. The sound system is really nice. I have over 8,000 miles on it, getting around 31-32 mpg on highway. I must say that I'm very pleased with this car. Kia's image is the only thing bringing this company down, give them a couple more years and your looking at the next Honda or Toyota. Can't wait to see whats next for them.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had been looking around at new cars. Ford A/Z plan eligible. Drove a Fusion and an Optima. Even with A plan pricing Optima beat out Ford with Features, Pricing (rebate + discount), and gas mileage. The 5* crash rating was the clincher. With Rebate + discount, paid $14,500 for a well equipped Optima LX. Would have liked to buy a Toyota but with the discount, warranty, and features feel like I got a steal. Had it for 3 weeks now and rides great. Getting 25 - 27 mpg mixed driving. Love the steering wheel controls for radio. Only regret is buying white which looks great, but it going to be work to keep clean. Recommend Kia to anyone looking at a Honda or Toyota to save some $$.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Optima EX V6 this month and it's VERY nice. Leather seats, Infinity audio system w/6 CD, mp3 plugin. Got the electronic stability package and the premium package. Drives and handles much nicer than my Ford Taurus. Surprisingly smooth ride on freeways and in town. Auto air keeps the interior at a constant 72 degrees (adjustable of course). Night driving, dash lights (soft blue) are admirable and well laid out. Easy to see or disregard when concentrating on driving. Average 33 mpg! 27 mpg when using the 5 speed Sportmatic transmission (FUN FUN FUN). It feels like a "Drive by wire" car. Pearl White turns heads. Air bags galore. Safe 5*.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Price, safety (5 star), GAS mileage, auto climate controls, 5 speed Sportmatic transmission, audio controls on steering wheel, auto head lights, smooth ride, all around solid car. No trouble as of yet. Oh, and free oil changes for the first 2 years from my dealer. :-)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The chrome looks very nice with the black and the tan interior is very nice. Everyone thinks it?s a more expensive car than it really is. I am 6?1?/250 lbs and I am satisfied with this mid size vehicle and all my friends say the same. The trunk is quite large and the only thing I don?t like about the interior is the backseat head rests: they block the view when you?re attempting to switch lanes pretty bad. The gas mileage is a little disappointing. It?s a mid size thus it?s a bit light and drives light and especially in the elements.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving my used 2001 KIA Rio to 120,000 trouble-free miles, it was time to trade it in. The $3000 rebate and some research made the Optima an easy choice. Simply put I really love this car. Performance is excellent, the 5-speed manual is smooth as silk, the engine feels more powerful than the numbers would suggest. Handling is good and the interior is comfortable and quiet (a big change from my old Rio. It was a great little car, but let's face it, it was a go-cart with doors!). You could easily spend a lot more for a car with fewer features. The KIA brand may not have "status" but they do deliver a lot of value for the money. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power of the 2.4L 4-cylinder engine. The smoothness of the 5-speed manual transmission. The base-model sound system is actually quite good. The trunk is also nice and roomy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We looked at other cars (Camry, Accord, Sonata) & Kia offered the most for the $ w/roomy interior, good mileage, lots of trunk space & 5 star front, rear & side impact ratings We opted for a fully loaded EX w/appearance pkg, convenience pkg & Electronic Stability Control. This includes leather & heated seats too! We got a great deal especially with the $3K cash back Kia offered So far the car has performed well. It handles very nice on the road. The interior is very quite at cruising speed, though the engine is heard when accelerating but it is not overbearing. Fit & feel are great, acceleration smooth. The interior to us was nicer style than others. Optima gets better more I drive it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>5 star crash ratings all around that beats Accord (3 stars in rear for them) important when you have kids! Roomy interior, smooth effortless driving. Rear sun shade helps keep car cooler. Manual stick-shift style option on the ATF for better control; Power adjustable pedals are also nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got this car about 1 month ago. After much research, I decided this car would provide the best value for the dollars invested and so far we have few complaints. My wife is not pleased with the "bumpy" ride, but for me I like to "feel" the road a little. I told her for the price we paid that I could get better shocks that would provide for a smoother ride, but so far we haven't made any modifications. For an out-the-door price of less than $15K (with $3000 in rebates) there wasn't anything new in this size of car that even came close. Been getting about 27 MPG with a 50/50 mix of city and highway driving. So far so good. We are very pleased with the purchase of this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my truck because of gas prices. The KIA was ranked high in safety, warranty, and performance. I was given great rebate incentives that brought down the price to around 14,000. The four cylinder has 168 HP, almost as much as the 6 cylinder. They gave me a great price for my trade. The warranty for the first buyer is a great one! The room in the Optima is great since I am 6'5". The car has a load of standard features: heated mirrors, tire pressure monitoring, 5 speed automatic transmission, 5 star crash rating, air bags all over, large trunk, great handling, and good MPG (I am getting over 30 currently) The KIA dealer was excellent too!!!</TEXT>

Would like a softer driver seat with a longer front cushion. The car has a "ping" sound when driving on rough roads. I had the car undercoated thinking it would help but it didn't.

<TEXT>I'm a ASE mechanic. My son drives a Camry and my wife drives an Accord. I am very familiar with these cars. When it was time for me to sell my Honda Element, I test drove the 2008 Accord, Camry, Sonata, Sebring. Then I rented a 08 optima with 7 miles on it for vacation and drove it 1000 miles. I was shocked. Right out of the box, it averaged 30 mpg on an engine that wasn't broken in yet. I was completely taken away with the build quality of this car. Tight panel seams, interior quality outstanding and very quiet. The accord handling and engine is better but this is a close 2nd. I bought this car $7000 less than a Camry and $6500 less than accord. Read Car and Drivers 2007 comparison.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently bought the optima because I needed something more fuel efficient than a Durango. I am very impressed with the car. Not only does it look good for the price but it drives great too. The inside has everything that a person could possibly need. Nothing extra that could just cause problems in the future. I don't care for 4 cylinders but with gas prices the way they are I couldn't pass this car up. If I didn't no that the car was only a 4 cylinder I would have never guessed it. Great car for the price. I would recommend it to anyone looking for something easy on gas and still have good style.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our optima after doing lots of research (consumer reports, edmunds, etc). The reviews caught our attention so we investigated and test drove the vehicle. The quiet ride in a strong cross wind was a positive. We also drove the Camry and Fusion. Both of these cars were nice but the price on the optima sold us. I wish the noise from the suspension were not as sharp when driving on roads with tar strips or ruts. I like the feel of the road and the ease of handling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Last summer I picked up my rental car from Hertz and it was Kia Optima. I was totally impressed with this car! After comparing to Camry, Accord, etc. I decided to buy one for myself. I have not been disappointed! This is one fun car to drive and I am very impressed with the peppy engine, interior room, and good looks. Great visibility gives a real 'feel' for the road. Our car includes the Appearance Pkg which really adds lots of 'goodies' and well worth the money. Also, you don't see lots of Optimas on the road, so that even makes it more fun to have a 'unique' car. Current generous rebates clinched the deal for me and so far it has been a perfect car for our family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my Focus for this car. Not a single disappointment. It's especially complimented on its deep ocean metallic blue. And when people see the interior there impressed, and when they hear the price and warranty (which I got the fully covered out to 100,000 10 years) not just the power train drive train, they really flip out. I can say I'm very pleased and impressed. I know I've only currently have 1600 miles, but its been a very pleasing trip</TEXT>

<TEXT>Several people have mistaken my black Optima for a Lexus and they are surprised to learn it is a $14,000 KIA. The car looks beautiful with its chrome trim and elegant lines. The interior is tasteful and stylish, although the seat fabric looks a little sub par compared to everything else. Lots of little extras make the car appear upscale including extended sun visors, steering wheel controls for cruise/stereo, and blue dash lighting. The car has 3000 miles and has had a few glitches. The center dome light didn't always come on, sometimes the trunk popped open when unlocking the doors and the 4 cyl engine sounds clattery. Hopefully the dealers are capable and cooperative. So far so good. </TEXT>

The car looks expensive, lots of safety features and a perfect 5 star rating, gas mileage is okay-about 25 mpg average, good warranty (as long as the dealership honors it), low price, spirited performance, quiet interior, quality stereo, and a roomy trunk. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just leased this vehicle for the gas mileage. The ride and comfort are awesome. The exterior styling is quite pedestrian. Fit and finish are excellent and the 4 cylinder engine is pretty peppy. You do not feel like you're driving underpowered. If the exterior styling isn't first and foremost in your mind, then for quality ride and transportation, I would highly recommend the Kia Optima. Plenty of interior space.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dash layout Engine is smooth Solid build Wheel to road feel is spot on. Plenty of interior space</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been very please with the kia purchase. I opted for the performance package with 17" wheels and black outkits. Performance feels more than actual specs, especially in town. Overall great built car for the price</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is perfect for my needs. It gets great fuel economy, has surprising zip for having a 4-cyl, and is very roomy. It feels comparable to a Camry/Accord. Not quite as luxurious maybe, but really excellent quality for the value. Comfortable ride for my passengers and lots of included features in just the base model that you'd have to pay for upgrade in other cars. I'd definitely purchase another one of these. Very impressed, did not disappoint at all. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Audio controls on steering, excellent A/C, and smooth ride. I also am surprised at how much I enjoy the "zig- zag" shift style. I thought it was weird at first, but you never make the mistake of trying to drive in neutral (not that I do that...).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car recently and it is really fun to drive. It is comfortable and roomy. It handles very well and I can't think of a better car for the price. I like the controls on the steering wheel and the temperature controls are very easy to use. I am very happy with this car and would recommend it to anyone. The warranty, roominess, and value are well well worth the cost. The body style is very sharp.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the air bags are my favorite feature. These are all standard with this car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After having this car for 6 months, I still am glad I bought it. I truly think with the warranty, quality, comfort etc - for a 4 door midsize sedan it is definitely a smart buy! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort of Seats, Controls, Performance for a 4 cycle is great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased a new '08 Optima in January and it has been in service twice because the "Check Engine" light came on. The day I bought the Optima and drove it on the freeway, the RPM went to 6000. The car hesitates when trying to accelerate and it drives like a four-cylinder. There could be a problem with the transmission in the '08 model. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car looks sharp and is roomy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Optima is a wonderful experience. The car drives real smooth in town and is very quiet on the interstate. It drives very solid and it is a great buy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the controls to the radio on the steering wheel. I like how easy it is use the a/c controls.</FAVORITE>
