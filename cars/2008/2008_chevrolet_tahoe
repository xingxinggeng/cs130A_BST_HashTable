<TEXT>I bought this vehicle and from day one have had problems. I have the LTZ and first the sunroof and entertainment system broke on day one, they replaced it. Then the check engine light came on twice and fixed it something with the omission system covered by warranty. Then the door handle came off for no reason in my hand, not covered by warranty, dealer said this happens to Tahoe's. Then intermediate steering column makes clunk noise not covered by warranty GM is aware of problem but won't recall it because not a safety issue. costs $300. I don't know about you but steering is a safety issue. No trunk space with 3rd row up. Not happy can't wait to trade it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Definitely love this Tahoe. This is my second SUV. Came from a 2006 Hummer H3, which I realized was a mistake shortly after the purchase. Even thought both vehicles are GM products, the Tahoe by far is definitely a better vehicle in every category, i.e., comfort, build quality, interior, exterior, gas mileage, and ride. My girlfriend and I absolutely love to drive the HOE. Avg. city mpg is around 15.5 and hwy when cruising around 70 mph is 21. Not bad for a 5600 lb. vehicle with a V8. Plan on keeping the Tahoe for many years. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought my Tahoe new last October on the 0% interest deal. Truck drives as smooth as can be on the highway. No squeeks, rattles, or loose parts in the interior and I am now at 12,000 miles. It is a bit sluggish for me, but power is good for the vehicle size (nothing a custom tune can't fix). I tend to have a heavy foot, and I am comparing it to the Trailblazer SS I had right before it. This is my first Full Size SUV and I am pleased so far. Feels like I am driving a house on wheels because it is so comfortable to drive. I feel very safe with my wife and baby boy in the car. I can get about 450 miles (mixed driving) to a tank of gas which is excellent in my opinion for a vehicle this size.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First GM in years. Came from a 08 Chevy classic truck. Bought this one sight unseen due to color prefrence. Tahoe was built in Arlington assembally plant. Very poor build job, had to adjust tailgate latch to get it to close, adjusted all doors and folding seats for smoother operation. Very poor rear seating quality, jamming is a problem when folding. Been in shop 4 times for electronic problems, intermittent failures of 4 wheel drive, Stabilitrac/Trac control. Looks like side molding tape will pull loose soon. Dealer claims wiring harness was routed wrong and was the cause of electronic faults. Again poor build quality. My suggestion would be to get your Tahoe from another assembally plant.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I have been wanting a new Tahoe for over a year. With the 0% and all we still couldn't afford much more than a base model LS. But we found a leftover 2008 LT with the LT2 package, plus second row bucket seats & third row vinyl seats. MSRP was over $42K, after Red tag and additional rebates we paid $31K. Even with paying 5% interest we were able to afford way more car than with the 0% sales. Go find a 2008 Tahoe now, you have the power to buy it for next to nothing!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got out of a Toyota Tundra. Loved it, looking for 5+ seating. My new LTZ is all the truck I'll need. Stuck with a truck/SUV because of the family boat. Cannot believe I paid $17,000 less than MSRP - could not find a better deal for same amount of truck anywhere. If you are in the market, you have 100% leverage and can buy a Tahoe for less than ever now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My neighbor and I bought vehicles at the same time. I bought the Tahoe and he bought the Expedition. We constantly rib each other about whose is better! Upon first drives, they both were very good vehicles. The Tahoe softer, and the Ford more nimble. Nearly a year later, I rode with him last week. His is still quiet. Mine squeaks, rattles, has highway wind noise. I never thought I'd say this, but I did not want to get back in my Chevy after riding in his year old Ford. Sorry, GM, it's good on test drives and initial quality, but just doesn't hold together as well as your competitor. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Love my new Tahoe! Just came from an Armada and do miss some of the extra storage but I'm loving the ride, super comfort. Mileage is awesome. If you practice hypermiling you can get 17mph around town. It's amazing how far this will coast. I didn't realize that new vehicles are designed to disengage the tranny when you let your foot off the gas. Great way to improve economy.Just went to Maine and got 20.4 hwy at 75mph and 21 when I cut it back to 62- 65mph.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the new 2008 Tahoe 6/27/08 and already have a major concern. We have a growing family and and our new one (w/3rd seat) stinks! The seating design was obviously not thought out very well. We purchased the 2008 with two full benches, second row has 40/60 split, and the car seat latch (anchors/tethers)system was not put in the correct spot. They are located on the 40 spilt, and the middle seat of the 60 spilt of the second bench, putting these directly behind the passenger seat and in the the middle making it impossible for anyone to accesess the 3rd bench without removing and re-installing a child car seat every time to access 3rd seat! (have 2 c/s's)</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Chevy Tahoe is one of a kind. Chevy has stepped its game up. Coming to fuel economy it get sabout 14 CTY 19 HWY. That is saying a little bit. The cons of the vehicle are the third row of seating has about 2-4 inches of leg room, the truck space is very limited. On some LT models the rims are not designed good. The pros are great towing ability, 1st and 2nd row comfort. The design is very nice and interior is nice. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My husband just bought me this '08 LTZ in the white diamond appearance pkg.w/ 20" wheels. It's a definite head turner. After driving a Toyota for 10years with no real issues I was set on getting another Toyota. However you can't beat the Tahoe in price and all the options. With a family of 4 we can't ask for anything more. And gas mileage is pretty good for such a large SUV. It's pretty comparable to the minivans we looked at. I'm getting about 16mpg in the city and about 21mpg on interstate driving. The Tahoe is the way to go!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new Tahoe! The ride and styling are awesome! Rides better than the car I traded. I have an LT3 with the Z71 package. I considered the LTZ, but felt I was getting a lot of expensive features that don't add much resale value. Save yourself the $2K for 20" wheels on the LTZ and get the Z71's 18 inchers. The Z71 also has all the chrome accents of an LTZ. I agree with another post that the Active Fuel Mgmt is a gimmick, but E85 is awesome. So what if mileage goes down, the fuel is cheaper and Made in the USA! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the LTZ with Sun/Fun and Entertainment package. I must say we love the car. This is my 3rd "current generation" Tahoe...had an '01, '04, and now the '08. A few "fit and finish" issues with seat covering pulling away from cushion...but nothing too tragic. They did fix a service bulletin item on my first service visit...problem with spring over left rear tire being slightly eskew caused a weird klunk when you went over speed bumps. Fixed at no charge...about 1/2 hr work. We've been very happy with the car. Gas mileage is better than a Honda Odyssey with lots of room, comfort, and luxury. Recommend highly...but haggle cause everybody's dumping their SUV's these days.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM integration, rear seat DVD with wireless headphones, power liftgate, remote engine start, auto folding middle seats (got the Captains Chair second row...highly recommend). Rear seat heaters. Navigation is easy to use</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my LTZ now for about 2 months and am pretty happy with it. Had an '03 Sequoia and was about to pull the trigger on an '08 but decided to test drive the Tahoe...thank God I did. Better looking, more features, and a better price than the Toyota. Only thing the Seqouia had which I wish the Tahoe has is fold flat 3rd row seating and a little more rear storage room. I've towed our boat and the automatic rear leveling suspension (which I guess is only available on the LTZ) works great. I wish I would have bought this a few months earlier to try the 4x4 out. By the way the guy who wrote that he's getting 18.3 mpg 70% city is a liar. I'm getting 14-15 mpg in 50/50 city/hwy driving. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall exterior appearance is beautiful! 20" wheels (although they are a rip-off at an option price of $1500), Nav, DVD player, XM, power rear lift gate, comfy seats, overall power but GM needs to ditch the old 4 speed and go with a more modern 5 or 6 speed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 1.5 years of SUV research and actually targeting the Denali, we found the White Diamond LTZ and were totally impressed over the Denali! Purchased this beautiful SUV w/White Diamond Pkg, 20" Wheels, Sun/Dest Ent Pkg, Titanium Interior 2 weeks ago for my wife and we both absolutely love it! I cannot say enough about being so impressed with how far GM has come in their interior design, dead-silent cabin, feature rich appointments, and overall comfort. With 2 kids, bags/laptop cases, a stroller, and almost daily trips to the store, this SUV is the most awesome and fitting vehicle we have owned to date. We intend to use the OnStar, as it will incoporate family shared plans on Verizon.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Customizable settings set by driver for pwr locks, pwr mirrors (curbtilt in reverse), daytime lights, driver seat exit feature - just to name a few. Bucket seats offer excellent comfort and pwr options, int door panels appear to be made of excellent, long- lasting materials (no fade or peel anticipated)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bot this car since we commute 1x week 200 miles back and forth from home to work through the mountains of western Maryland. This truck is a dream to drive on the highway. We bought the car because of 0% finance and GM rebate. The $49,000 sticker was really the same price as a $36K car, so it was a good value. We are pleased, except that the car is so big and heavy it is a little tough in the city. Gas mileage for us is 16.9 combined over the past 5000 miles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Compaired Tahoe and Toyota Sequoia, bought the Tahoe. A lot more equiptment for the money, nicer interior and better gas mileage. New 100K/5yr warranty also helped with decission. I have the LTZ with all the toys and they all work as advertised. Ride is very smooth,the V8 to V4 modes are seamless. Biggest negative is rear seating, especially the 3rd row and the lack of independant rear suspension. The Toyota is the winner in these areas. The 08 Tahoe appears larger than my 03 Tahoe Z71 , but it has the same dimentions. The 08 is less truck like than the 03 with a lower dash. The 03 did have more storage areas than the 08. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got my wife into the 2LT with the Sun & Entertainment package added in. It's basically an LTZ without the chrome and the heated rear seats. We got it black with cashmere (tan) interior. It's super sharp looking. The wife loves it. Our goal was to have our three kids fit across the 2nd row bench seat, leaving plenty of cargo room -- or room for other kids. It's no problem. The kids love the DVD, and the wife is loving the sweet Bose system with sat radio, nav, and the rear view cam. I can't wait to start trying the OnStar, and try towing my boat with it. This makes our old (loaded) Pacifica look pretty lame. If you need the full size SUV for the family, this ride is truly great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My family recentley bout a white diamond edition LTZ Tahoe 2wd. The vehicle is excellent its luxurious but we still can tow our boat with it! The navigation system and power tailgate make for easy loading and directions. The OnStar system is also handy. My mom already got locked out, and they opened our doors right up. The car has some Escalade bling to it as well. The 20" rims accent the metallic white diamond paint well. The chrome grille makes the truck look more powerful. And it gets fairly good mpg for a full size truck as well!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I downsized from my 2005 Suburban, but haven't regretted the loss of cargo area. I purchased this vehicle with all available options including the Z71 off road protection. Have had it loaded with 3 hunters, 25 geese decoys, 3 duck blinds and all our gear, and could've added more, can't wait for turkey season. This vehicle handles exceptionally well and is an absolute pleasure to drive, always comfortable ride and has felt safe to drive in all of our weather conditions- rain, ice and snow.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the new exterior and interior changes with this model. So many features to enjoy from auto-start, auto-rear hatch opener, touch screen navigation/stereo/dvd display. Bought to use for hunting/golf trips, but passes for "Sexy Sport". Can't wait to roll with the windows down and the sunroof back.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Growing up as the son of an executive in the auto industry, I started at a young age having the opportunity to drive many different styles, and types of vehicles. My first personal SUV purchase was a 1991 Chevy Trailblazer. From there, I've owned, leased or at least have driven every GM style SUV, both full size and mid size. In December, my company decided it was time for me to turn in my 2003 Chevy Tahoe as it had 167,000 miles on it. Picking up the new Black 4wd LT was very exciting, however, I didn't realize just how exciting it truely was going to be. It rides better than most cars I've driven. Hands down it's the best SUV I've ever driven.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2008 Tahoe w/ 2LT. Compared to my 05 Yukon SLT, the new Tahoe is a huge improvement. Interior, specifically the dash, is now luxurious as opposed to looking like a cheap truck. Leather is much better quality. 3rd row seats still don't fold flat, have to manually remove. But now the 2nd row doesn't fold flat. They tumble forward to allow access to 3 row. Nice if you need it, but I'd rather have the 2nd row fold flat like the older version that made the cargo area cavernous. Yukon was loud, lots of wind noise. This Tahoe is quiet and has a very smooth ride. Expert reviews complain its too soft and unresponsive. I'll take soft any day. Not doing slaloms in a 5500 lb trk. avg 16 mpg</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great looking SUV. Much nicer interior. XM builtin. improved Leather. Rear parking sensor a plus. Smooth quiet ride. Actually like new front buckets without the armrests better. Flex fuel is useless. Fuel mgt seems to be a gimmick. same mpg as yukon. Doesn't stay in 4 cyl mode long enough. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After due research I decided against the BMW X5 and the Mercedes GL320 in favor of the Tahoe LTZ, based on total satisfaction on my previous 2002 Tahoe. I am very satisfied with the choice and I saved $25,000 over the others. The Tahoe so far exceeds anything I experienced in testing out the BMW or Mercedes. The fuel economy should improve as I break in the engine. Recommend this awesome car! Also recommend the sun and sound options with the LTZ that includes the rear camera, DVD, Navigation system and sunroof. </TEXT>

<TEXT>As a previous Ford owner, we are trying our first Chevy. So far, it has been great. OnStar and navigation systems are a very nice asset. The comfort is comparable to the Ford Expedition, possibly more room in the front seats than the Ford counterpart. Ride is what you would expect from the SUV vehicle market. Interior is roomy with rider's comfort in mind. Third row is tight and Chevy needs to take a lesson from Ford in this area.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After going Japanese for the last 7 years, I finally went back to the General and I was not disappointed. My Tahoe LTZ is very well built, comofortable, beautiful and drives every bit as well as any import.

I only wish that Chevy would finally put in fold flat seats in the vehicle.</TEXT>
