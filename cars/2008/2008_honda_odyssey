<TEXT>The Odyssey bought new in 08 has 27K. I posted previous reviews. Additional comments to previous posts are the brake feel could be improved. Mileage improved to 30 mpg on several trips using 91 octane, non ethanol gas, speed 60 -65 mph. 28MPG has been seen many times. In the suburbs mileage is 21 - 23, Keep acceleration RPM at 2000 vs jack rabbit starts. The van has had no repairs except for a minor issue with the glove compartment door becoming misaligned due to a screw. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior gauge legibility, headlight projection at night, seat comfort, ease of entry/exit, turning circle, outside style, outside visibility, navigation and XM radio, EXL/Nav features, drive-ability, tray/cup-holders between driver/fr passenger.

<TEXT>Vehicle is average with utility in mind. This could be an excellent basic transportation were it not for tire and drivetrain vibration, road noise and Honda's denial and refusal to fix problems. This is not a luxury vehicle even though it is priced as one. Not refined, just good basic transportation. There are better choices.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Since we needed more space, I traded our Acura RDX and it was well worth it. The RDX was fun but it lacked cargo space and ran only on premium gas which was expensive. I chose the Odyssey because it is rated overall the top mini van in its class. Its able to hold a baby seat, infant seat, two strollers, guitar, etc. The seats are very comfortable. Driving feels like you're riding on air. </TEXT>

<TEXT>First let me start of by saying that I am a huge car guy. Overall the odyssey is a nice minivan. It is a nice ride for a longer road trip or hauling people around, probably the best minivan out there right now, not that there is a very large selection available. On the down side it is far from perfect. First of when you get a car that is $40000+ you should expect better interior materials, especially on the dash. It's all hard plastic, kinda like the pre- 2007 GM's. I have owned infinities before in the same price range and the dashes were much more luxurious. Secondly the seats other then the driver side are not exactly comfortable. The backs stick out to much. The outside mirrors stink</TEXT>

<TEXT>We drove it from Augusta, Ga. with 14,000 mi. It was smooth and comfortable but so was my 2000 Dodge Minivan with 154,375 mi. Too many toys on the Touring model. Fun to drive: It's a Minivan, how much fun is it driving a Minivan, it's not a sports car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this brand new and at first I did not want a minivan, but I've found I like the convenience of it. Now I absolutely can't stand it, the passenger side door rattles. At first it sounded like a marble. They took the door apart and wrapped everything, it was gone for a few months, now it's a new rattle and now the other door has started. It's bad when your 4 year old says, "mommy my door is rattling again." You can't even turn up the radio to drown it out. It's only a year old and I want to get rid of it. I wish I never got rid of my 4Runner. Dealer says he's never heard of this problem. After reading the reviews, it sounds very common.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A follow-up review from our first month of ownership. My wife and I bought the van for long trips. Using 91 octane at 60-65 mph we average 27-28 MPG. Mileage in town 21 MPG using a light foot on the accelerator. Combined mileage about 22-23. Very comfortable on long trips. Navi great, seats great, maneuverability great for van, entry/exit seat height great, noise control OK, front suspension OK, mileage better than SUV, exterior looks great, gauge legibility great, headlight projection great, dash design dated (think JDM), interior plastic too cheap. Upgrade the 2010 interior plastic to match the 2009 Pilot. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navi, seats, room, seat height, gauges. EXL with Navi has great features. When you add it up, the overall experience is great, even if not scoring at the top of many categories. Much like the old Volvo 240/940, it is the whole package score that moved the vehicle to the top. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had the vehicle for 15 months with little to no problems. I did hit a deer on Thanksgiving Eve which did $2200 damage to car. Had repairs done through the dealership with no problems. My only real complaint with the car is the rattles! The passenger side slider sounds like it will rattle right off the hinges. Both sliders creek when coming to and pulling away from a stop. Very annoying! While the second row power down windows seem like a great feature, when the windows are open it sounds like I'm driving with flat tires and the thumping in my ears is annoying. I don't have the second row windows down. I'd much prefer the far back windows to vent open. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was really stuck whether to buy a van. But now I am glad I did. After 10 months it has been a good experience. I was also wondering about the cylinder shutdown feature but never notice it; it's so smooth. Mileage on a half city; half hwy was 21MPG when checked. Haven't really found any thing I don't like. Everyone that has driven or rode in it is impressed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall I'd say the fact that it drives like a car. Very quiet and very comfortable. A really nice vehicle on a trip.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got a screaming deal on the Odyssey EX- L 2008 for only $26,388. I have to admit that I was not that excited when my wife wanted to get a van but now I am a convert. Roomy, functional, and surprisingly agile, which is the reason why I picked the Odyssey over the Sienna. Nice fit and finish, power delivery is smooth across the range (no kick down , comfortable ride even in the third row!! My only beef with it is that the gas mileage stinks in city driving. No other issue so far after over 9000 miles. Improve the gas mileage rating and it's a true winner. Very happy with purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just turned my '05 ody in for the '08 EX-L RES. Overall, some nice improvements (back up monitor, tighter fit/finish on dash, minor exterior tweaks). The big let-down is that the 2nd row jump seat no longer stows in the floor compartment. BAD BAD move Honda: that was incredibly useful; now, you have to either leave it in (hard to access the third row), or leave it at home or in the back compartment. Whose bright idea was that at Honda?? Still a great van.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I picked up this bad boy for $22,595 after holding them to their teaser ad. I simply would not let them bait and switch me. The deal got done, and I am very happy. I have only had the van for two weeks but the gas mileage seems rough. 13 miles/gallon. Just like a recent review, the van does not seem to want to coast. It seems like it wants to brake. It may be part of the VSA system... Anyway the rest of the car is the best car ever!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far we've put 2K miles on the van and are very happy with our purchase. The van interior is fantastic with very nice leather and dvd system. It drives more like a sports car/van rather than a floaty minivan. Overall we are very happy except for the fact that it has been getting between 12 and 14 mpg in the city and 17 on the highway. Both my wife and I drive very conservatively and even more so with the gas mileage. Mpg has improved some but we're no way close to the 25 hwy. If it does not improve we will be taking it in for service. Also, transmission does not allow van to coast and slows speed at 40 mph and under. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had the van for close to a month now and it is everything we expected. The navigation system is not the best, but the screen that comes with it makes everything else easier to read/see. The navigation itself is always giving us the "easiest route" not the most economical one. The leather interior is so worth it and the speaker system is just fine. We paid $31,800 total (plus the 6% Indiana sales tax) and used an internet quote to get the price down to where we were happy. The gas mileage was the biggest negative, but we get about 17/21</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had great prior experience w/ Honda Accord so purchased vehicle over Toyota, Nissan. Traded in '98 Caravan driven for over 100K miles. Solid ride, standard options, and Honda reputation drove my decision towards the Odyssey. Cylinder deactivation is a plus. Very disappointed in quality though. This is a grocery getter, and not driven hard. After 9K miles, there has been 4 trips to dealer for alignment service, resulting in premature tire wear, 2 trips for steering knock (which by the way is a known serv bulletin issue that requires special lubricant on the steering column), now a rattle in the sliding door. This is a Honda? I actually had less issues w/ Caravan. Now test driving a Sienna.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Honda contiues to impress me. I have been a Honda fan all of my life. From my first mini-bike as a kid to our most recent Odyssey purchase. I checked out the Toyotas, but the Honda can't be beat in styling or ride quality. The 4 wheel independant suspension makes our Odyssey drive like our Accord. The ride extremly quiet, vitually no engine or road noise. My wife and I love listening to XM radio while the kids watch DVDs with the wireless headphones. I know some folks are stuck on their SUV image, but nothing can beat the value or functionality the Odyssey delivers to perfection. Go Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had back to dealer multiple times for various problems. The rear power hatch stopped working - needed new motor. The transmission clunks into gear - had lever/linkage adjusted but still doing it. Radio reception is terrible and overall it's a noisy ride at highway speeds. Anyone getting 20 mpg must be coasting downhill with engine off....best so far in 5000 miles is about 17mpg!!! Would I buy again - never!</TEXT>

<TEXT>What is not to love. We have 4 kids and our only options at this point are suburbans or Minivans. We looked at Chrysler T&C, Toyota and Honda... Honda was a no brainer! It has plenty of horsepower with our whole family and a incredibly smooth ride. For the family who needs a "touring" vehicle with all the bells and whistles this is the car. The sound system is excellent ( I have 2 teenagers and it is very important). it is also important to have teenagers to show you how to use the nav system.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Dont judge it by my 9s to most people this car is a 10. I just think you can improve on everything. Great van. It runs great, is extremely comfortable. The fuel economy is good but not great. I did find the highway mileage impressive. I got 29 mpg average with luggage and 3 adults and 2 babies. City is around 20 mpg, still pretty good for its size. Try that in a regular suv. It's a van so performance and fun to drive not what you expect in a van but it's a great ride. Everything else interior, exterior, quality, and reliability is summed up in 1 word Honda. I would purchase the extended warranty though only because lots of bells and whistles that can break. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded in our 05 EXL RES with 47,700 miles on a 08 EXL R&N and the difference is amazing. The ride has improved, the sound dampening has improved, and the fit and finish is better. The floor mats aren't as thick, have less thread count, and they aren't engraved with Odyssey on them. The back of the 3rd row seats are now carpet instead of leather. I like the telescoping steering wheel a lot better and now it's more ergonomically comfortable to drive. Even my wife can tell a drastic improvement between the two vehicles. We never thought we'd like driving or even owning a mini-van, but now we can't live without it. Convenience, room, better gas milage than SUV's, and comfort done well</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>2008 Odyssey LX</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Before buying the Honda, I extensively test drove every 2007 and 2008 minivan currently available on the market. I've only put about 1,000 miles on this van so far, but I am extremely impressed with every aspect of this people hauler. The LX came with everything that I wanted and nothing I didn't. We owned an '05 Accord for a few years and I think the Odyssey handles like an oversized Accord with a better view of the road. Around town mpg is right at 20 so far - no trips yet. I think this is the best van on the market for the money (paid $23,500 plus tax and license). I am rating this against recently test driven and previously owned mini vans, not all vehicles in general. Hope this helps.</TEXT>

Dealer service agent promised to take it to body shop to get it inspected at my service visit. Seems to be a loose snap. Mileage so far is not great. In city, only around 15.5 mpg. No long hwy driving so far. Love rearview camera integrated to rear-view mirror. I think it is better than having camera view in dash. You don't have to take your eyes off mirror.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our 4th Honda and our 2nd Odyssey and every generation gets better. The van is fun to drive. I love the car-like handling and responsiveness. It has plenty of power for pickup. There is ample of room for 6 adults. Middle 2nd and 3rd row seats are sized for kids only. I have had my new 2008 Odyssey for 2 months now and it has developed one problem. The right sliding door's opened window safety feature which keeps the door from sliding all the way became engaged even when the window is closed which is keeping the door from opening all the way. I'll be taking it to the dealer for repair. The mileage is close to 13 in the city and 20 on the hwy; less than what the window sticker states.</TEXT>

After driving the CX9, Acadia, and Enclave we looked at an Odyssey. While minivans may not be "cool" there was simply no comparison in the way the Odyssey functioned compared to the others.

It handles, turns, and rides like a much smaller car, and the interior room, technology, design and versatility are wonderful.

The $3,000. discount off of MSRP from the dealer was a big incentive. In terms of quality, comfort, fun to drive, handling, and entertainment features, it's been great for my wife and our kids. For such a complex vehicle with all of its gadgets, there has not been one defect so far; not even a rattle or squeak. The only negative I have seen so far is the mileage is not all that good.

<TEXT>We love our new Odyssey. It has plenty of pickup, and delivers close to 20 MPG in regular driving, meaning some town, some freeway. All freeway we're getting close to 25mpg. I think the people getting 13 or whatever have a lead foot or do a lot of stop and go. So far no defects except for a carpet stain that we found after buying it. The dealer cleaned it up, and I think a mechanic probably did it or something. This engine really pushes hard above 3000 revs, and it sounds wonderful doing it. The Sienna felt like a barge next to this, and the Caravan and Chrysler both seemed too "plastic" or something. The Honda fit us great.</TEXT>

We went with the 08' because of the newer engine technology, options not included on the 07' model. and the new look. Pricing was higher, but we feel it was worth it.

<TEXT>I have only driven this van about 3000 miles and I have to say that I am VERY DISSAPOINTED in HONDA PRODUCTS!. I have been to the dealership a total of twelve times for an array of problems. The sliding door fell of it's track onto my 7 year old's foot. The DVD player keeps skipping. The lights on the dash will go out with no warning. The brakes are starting to squeek when they are hot. It has terrrible gas miledge (13 city/16 hwy). I had traded a Dodge Durango that got better gas mpg than this thing. And it never broke down or sent me to the dealership for any repairs. I have almost three years left on the lease of this scary creature. I don't think I'm going to make it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The van has great interior fit finish and space flexibilty. Little I would do to improve, other than some road noise and very poor MPG. With the variable cylinder management, I has hoping to get near the sticker MPG. There seems to be some extra vibration in the steering column when the engine is under load. It was bad enough I actually thought a tire was out of balance - easy to get at and change the engine oil.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Vehicle purchased new 08/07. Have had many issues that started as early as 500 miles including dead battery, headlamp switch short, relays short, clunking noises to front undercarriage, steering column replacement, slider door safety locks freeze preventing sliders to lock while open, rattles to right door trim panels. The newest of the problems now at 21K to address with dealer is the headliner seam coming apart and the heater controls not functioning properly. We have NEVER been so unhappy with a vehicle. Traded our 02 Toy Sienna, what a mistake. Tried trading this vehicle in, dealers are offering low trade... now I wonder if the reliability factor was utilized in the low trade offers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife had gone on record as saying she would never drive a minivan. Three kids later she's driving the Odyssey and loves it. The interior is extremely versatile and great room for the kids, their friends and all of the accumulated stuff. We've had it on several trips and it's performed great with just over 25 mpg on the highway and around 19-20 around town. The seats are comfortable and it drives more like a car than most vans and handles surprisingly well. It does have a lot of wind noise, primarily from the front passengers seat, but we just turn the radio up. The breaks are softer than what I'd prefer but not to the point of feeling like we're in danger. My wife's glad we bought it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought after totaling 02 Grand Caravan. Has awesome power, looks great. Climate control poor, only can control temp of rear cabin and not fan speed or mode from the front. Interior is extremely uncomfortable and hard. Dome lights will not go off automatically (What?). I drive mostly highway @ 80MPH and get about 18MPG. Caravan was 22MPG. Kinda confusing about maint schedule. There is no set time, you have to rely on the comp to tell you when to take it in. Might be 7500 miles or 3000. Stereo controls are too far away from driver to be comfortable. Hopefully the reliability and longevity will compensate for the shortfalls. Wish I had my Dodge back but playing the cards I'm dealt. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Honda experience. A very reliable well built car. Has many features but always wondered why they couldn't have a back-up sensor (versus a camera) or a windshield wiper fluid sensor, common features on American made vehicles. One of the few minivans still in production. My biggest complaint in the navigation system, which was outdated the minute I drove it off the floor. The system also tells you that you have arrived at your destination when you are still at least a block away. You can't get the back up camera without buying the navigation system. I carry a plug in portable system for navigation.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Lease was up on my 05 Sienna, so I leased an 08 Odyssey, due to the better lease rate and better exterior styling. Wow do I miss my Sienna after 4 months. The Honda feels so cheap in every way. Fit and finish is TERRIBLE. Several paint flaws, poor fit of exterior trim, horrible fit of interior trim and interior surfaces which feel cheap and scratch ridiculously easily. Brakes are downright scary, they are so soft. Stereo is the worst I have heard since the AM in my old 66 VW. Rough ride, excessive wind noise and an amazing number of rattles round out the package. Hopefully this thing at least turns out to be reliable.</TEXT>

Got stuck in a snow bank and of course there are no hooks under the car to attach a chain to pull it out - dig, dig, dig!!! Two months ago the side sliding door jumped off the track and had to be repaired -- two days in the shop!! On real cold days, before driving, the tire pressure alert show low tire pressure.

<TEXT>This is the worst vehicle I have ever owned. Passenger window rattles, brakes are poor, seat is hard and uncomfortable, radio sound quality is dismal. Also the paint is rough to the touch as though it has dirt embedded in it. The steering wheel does not return to the on center position without assistance.

<TEXT>This is our sixth Honda, and third Honda minivan. The 2008 van is impressive in every way but one. The brakes are - (and I am not stretching the truth here) - the brakes are the worst brakes I've ever had on any vehicle be it car, van, truck, or bicycle! Took it back to the dealer and was told this was normal? Now if it were a faulty cup holder or other trivial item, I would have some tolerance, however I am almost afraid to drive this vehicle. It seems the vehicle quality from the Georgia factory is way below par for the Honda that I know (My 2002 van was built there too and had a huge list of problems).</TEXT>

<TEXT>While my husband recently came home bearing gifts. He left with my Suburban and came home with a Odyssey. I was expecting to notice a huge increase in gas mileage. Only about 18 in the city w/air. Not at all pleased with the quality of the interior it barely gets touched by something and scratches horribly! Some pieces are not put together well and they don't match up. The carpet seems to stain really easy and not the best of quality. Seems to change gears at times a bit rough when slowing down quickly. STILL cannot figure out the concept or design with the middle seat belt. TOTALLY useless! The space is so little for a small child but then the seatbelt cuts them across the throat! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like to features on the steering wheel and the mirror to see all passengers. Would be nice to have ALL of the windows tinted. Seats need more lumbar support.

<TEXT>Very comfortable for both commuting and hauling the family. Annoyed by all the door safety interlocks, but getting used to them. Fit and finish is average. The dash looks like it was slapped together with some of the lines and edges not matching up. The passenger air bag trim is slightly lifted causing a gap between it and the dash. So far I am happy with it. Got 24.3 mpg with 95% highway and 21.5 mpg with 75% highway (AC always on). Looks like the mpg is getting better as the engine breaks in and the computer better controls the VCM.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned the van for about a month and have driven 3K miles on a trip. On the positive side the van is nice to drive, looks good and has power. On the negative side the road noise is excessive. When passing a truck you can hardly hear anyone else in the car. The noise from bumps in the road is also very loud. Automatic shifting is rough. The front seats are not very comfortable compared to my 2005 Dodge van. The radio sound is very good but it has the poorest station range of any car I've owned in the last 20 years. The little mirror on the sun glasses holder is useless. It needs a compass. At this point I'm not too thrilled about this purchase.</TEXT>

The older one was an EX-L with Nav and DVD. The addition of movable pedals, Bluetooth, memory seats, and power rear liftgate are nice. The fog lights are a nice addition, too.

<TEXT>I?m an engineer and have been interested in and working on cars for years. I?ve been reading these user reviews and have been amazed at how many people claim low gas mileage. From these reviews it would appear that the Ody is a real gas pig. This however, is not the case. My Ody gets about 17-18 mpg S. Cal city driving (stop lights every 200- 500 yards). If I can get this and your getting 12 then one or more of the following apply: *low tire pressure (<28) *driving habits (ultra-short 1-5 mile trips-engine not reach operating temp) *load / number of passengers (6+ passengers) *can't properly calc mpg (many don?t do it right) bottom line: engine variation is negligible.

<TEXT>Overall, a great van. I had a 2005 Touring, which performed excellently in a roll over - not a scratch or bruise on me. That was reason enough to get a second. This time we opted for the EX-L w/ R&N. There are a few things I miss, like the memory seats (I'm 6'1", my wife 5'2"), auto headlights, rear sensors and the rear power door, some of which should be standard. We compared the new Chrysler van (a relative has comparable one), and they are by far more feature intensive at the same price, but they just didn't have the same level of comfort and the gas mileage isn't as good. Would like to see some of the options at a lesser cost, like Bluetooth. $800 - a joke!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Smooth driving experience with good pick-up when I need it. I had a v-8 Ford Explorer beforehand, and the Honda has as much acceleration at the Explorer. The brakes are fantastic, highly responsive, excellent stopping distance. We settled for the EX model because for the features in the EX-L, we couldn't justify the price. I don't understand the other comments re: road noise--our van is by far one of the quietest vehicles I've ever driven. Gas mileage isn't too bad--we consistently get 24 highway--but city suffers a bit at 17 mpg on average. We added our own DVD player and screen for a fraction of what it would have cost at the dealership---a little hassle, but saved us nearly $1500!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought a 2008 EX-L just over 4 months ago and my wife (and I) couldn't be more pleased. We compared this vs. the Toyota Sienna, and while my wife liked the "softer/smoother" freeway ride of the Sienna, the Odyssey handled better than the Sienna when making any turns over 15 MPH. Around-town fuel economy averages about 19 MPG). The big test came last week when our family of 4 took a trip from So. Cal to the Bay Area. The Odyssey was *extremely* comfortable over the entire trip. The kicker was that I calculated that the van got **27.9 MPG** on the freeway. Avg speed: 75 MPH; cruise control on when possible; A/C on about 80% of the time. The variable-cylinder technology really works well! </TEXT>

<TEXT>OK - I have to agree with another reviewer that said many folks will take back their great ratings after putting some miles on the Ody. This is a follow up to an earlier review. The 2008 Ody drives and handles well, but that's where it all stops. Our problems to date include: steering spline knock, faulty wheel alignment, engine ping/knock, oil leak, rattling front windows, and Air Conditioning that currently works only on the passenger side. None of these issues were of course apparent when the car was purchased, but it did not take very long for them to surface. We are bringing the Ody in for service tomorrow, so we'll see how things go. But for now, it's two big thumbs down!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Unfortunately we have had many issues with our brakes. They seem to need ?time? to build pressure. When we leave our house, stopping at the stop sign takes a lot of work. Now I don?t mean it is impossible to stop, just uncomfortable. I have taken it into the dealership many times and they seem to do something that makes the brakes feel great at the time, but in a few weeks they go back to feeling the same. I?m still dealing with this issue after about 5 months now and I?m in the process of getting a lawyer to get it taken back on lemon law. Don?t get me wrong thought; I?m very comfortable when driving and it looks stylish. In my opinion it gets great gas mileage for a minivan. Check it out! </TEXT>

<TEXT>It has been a month and 1,000 miles since we got our Odyssey. I am very impressed with the van and I am very happy with the buy. The van drives very smooth and plenty of power and good agility. It is also very roomy and comfortable. We have 2 car seats and the interior room is great for our family. The sound system and the DVD player works great. The Navi and DVD are easy to use. I first thought there might be too many features to learn. But it only took me a short time to be very comfortable with all of the controls and features. The gas mileage is good for a vehicle this size, thanks to the cylinder deactivation. I get 18 to 23 combined both freeway and city. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Navi and DVD work great and are very easy to use. The sound system is decent, but sounds very good when you play DVD movies. The tri-zone climate control works good.

<TEXT>Have a case open with Honda on these brakes. This issue has been known for over a year and a half and dealers have no fix, Honda says they are working on it. These brakes are firm when new but after a couple of thousand miles become soft. Note the several accidents involved with the brakes in Edmunds forum.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If in the market for a minivan, it is hard not to pick the Odyssey. While styling is never in the forefront in such a practical vehicle, this vehicle looks great. The engine is silky smooth, and the VCM is seamless. The DVD system allows all passengers in the 2nd and 3rd row to see and hear great, while the drivers can listen to the radio or just talk. The navigation system is among the best I have seen. The fold down third row is convenient. Access to all seating is easy for all from the youngest to oldest. Really no downside here.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We recently purchased the EX-L model. We paid $28,200 including the audible back-up sensors (rear bumper) option. Tax, Tags, Title, processing fee was extra. We are disappointed after bringing the car home and discovering that there are latch anchors for only 1 car seat in the 3rd row. What that means is that we need to put our other two kids in the 2nd row seats. This eliminates your ability to slide one of the 2nd row seats up for easy access to the 3rd row. It also prevents mom from sitting in the 2nd row next to the newborn. The Toyota Sienna has latch anchors for 2 car seats in the 3rd row. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have never owned a Honda but had seen and heard about the Odyssey and decided it was worth a look. We bought and have fallen in love with the van. We only have one child but really like the room, convenience, the ride and overall quality. My wife has been stuck on SUVs and has told me over and over again what a smart buy this van was and how she absolutely loves it. You will not be disappointed and can be comforted with the fact that as a Honda product your going to get the value (resale/residual) and the performance and life expectancy you expect. Oh and the gas mileage after 3,000 miles is pretty good. I can cruise at 75 and be on 3 cylinders. I'm getting about 22.5 - 25 city/hwy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Automatic sliding door. Rear camera (standard now on EX-L), Wheels, VCM, Steering wheel comfort. Leather is top notch. Cup holders everywhere. I paid what I should have: Invoice minus the marketing support money, plus the 0.9% financing. About 26,900</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We resisted a minivan for a while, but after another baby, took the plunge. The Ody test drove better than Sienna and my older son liked the look, so we traded in our Toyota Avalon. So far, we have returned to the dealer twice (a long drive and missing work) due to the TPMS light coming on. Each time they reset it/initialized it and then an hour later as I drove it home, it popped on again. VERY annoying and the stability control won't work when it's on, so also a safety issue. I do like how it drives and the looks of it, but didn't expect to be annoyed by Honda already.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Based on several reviews I bought Odyssey without much thoughts. It is a good van for family. But, now I have 900 miles in the car with an awful 10-11 miles/gallon city + fwy. I saw some others also complains about low mileage of odyssey. while my friends 2008 odyssey gives 21 mpg city + fwy in my driving. I took it to the dealer and they asked to leave the car for 3 days for fuel test with out any compensation for replacement car. In general the odyssey makes lot of noise. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my van. I tried the Toyota and was not impressed. Although you can get more for your money. The quality was not superb as mine. I'd rather get basic model and get the right choice! However Honda's basic does come with a lot. Toyota offers some of my basics as options. The gas mileage is great as well. I am getting 19/20 mpg. We all need that with the gas prices. I'd rather drive a van than any suv too. </TEXT>

<TEXT>1. Additional KARR security system (cost $599, it raise your month payment $10 more) was a big/unwanted surprise on financial sign time. I almost walked out. 2.Front face got ugly. 2007s were much prettier. That ugly look made me hesitate till last moment. Accord is accord, Odyssey is odyssey. Real reason accord sell less than Camry is the look. Honda messed up with CR-V and accord, then odyssey. This is not a family look, it is a group-dummy look.

<TEXT>This is my third Honda vehicle and all of them have been exceptional products. I have just 4,000 miles on the van so far and I'm very impressed. It rides and handles very well! I just came back from a 3,200 cross-country trip and I was impressed with the gas mileage. Droving 78-82 MPH for most of the trip, loaded to the gills with luggage, my wife and 2 kids, running the A/C the entire time, I got a consistent solid 23 MPG. While driving on country back roads around 65-70 MPH, I achieved 27 MPG. In city driving I get 17-18 MPG. Everything is functional and well designed. No problems with anything so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this 2008 Honda Odyssey Touring in February and it's the best van I ever bought. It has a really powerful engine which provides a forceful and strong pull. I have have a little over 20,000 miles and there is no problems. It feels rock solid and expensive when compared to the cheap Toyota Sienna. I averaged 30.6 mpg on a 2000 mile highway road trip. Much better then competition like Toyota or Nissan. Go Honda Products! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just picked up the van Touring W/O PAX today after months of research. Odyssey was the top choice hands down. We also got a great deal ($6000 off MSRP plus 2.9% APR special). Very pleased with the van. It drives smooth like a car and it drives much smaller than it is. The power and agility are remarkable for a vehicle this size (I owned an Infiniti G35 coupe and M35 the Odyssey drives like a nice sedan). The interior is so comfortable. The build quality and material are top notch. The flexibility of the seats is fantastic. It has tons of cargo room or it can seat 8 people in style and comfort. There are so many features on the touring model. Almost too many to learn. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is truly the most disappointing car that I have ever owned. First we got the sage green and the bumpers do not match the rest of the car, they are a totally different shade and color. Honda states that this is normal due to the type of material. I have never seen this before. Called several times on this matter with the same explanation. No other cars in my area seem to have this problem. Several makes and colors. The bumpers also keep falling off been to dealer 4 times. This car is very noisy inside while driving, cannot hold a conversation at normal voice. This is also the same for my friends 05 Ody with different tires. The car also is getting lots of rattles.

<TEXT>We lost our 2007 Caravan Special Edition to another driver who didn't understand the word "stop". While I've always felt Chrysler wins hands-down in the innovation department, I was leery of purchasing a 2008 model due to this being the first year of a major overhaul. The 2008 also lost some aesthetic points that it once had over the Ody (IMHO). The Ody wins hands-down in interior quality. The leather is nicer, the seats are more comfortable, and the fit and finish is better (but still not perfect). The Ody is still breaking in, so too early to tell on mileage. Acceleration is smooth. The vehicle is larger inside and out compared to Chrysler, so watch your parking/garage issues.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>NAV is a nice toy. The screen's tie-in to the radio and DVD player is very nice. Handling is much nicer than Caravan, although ride suffers a bit. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just traded in my 2008 Honda Accord EXl 4cyl . Needed more room and wanted dvd and nav so i went for the big enchilada. Boy am i happy with this van,It's everything i had heard and read and more. The leather is of high grade and the seats are so comfortable.Having DVD made our trip to Asheville NC quiet with two teenagers and a 6 year old in the back. And without nav i would not have attempted as much of the exploring i did in Asheville.I read some of the complaints on here about being given strange routes but it does give options to route by easiest,direct,hwy . I found the nav very user friendly and powerful. The new Odyssey is a technological wonder and why Honda rules minivan market!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After several years of owning Toyotas, )'95 Camry, '01 4Runner, '04 Matrix), we traded in the Matrix after we realized we couldn't get three car seats in the Matrix. We found a certified '02 Odyssey w/ very low miles. (my wife cried, knowing that she was driving a damned van). Other than being drab gray, it's been a good vehicle. Having a bunch of work to do on my 4runner, I traded it in, and we leased a new '08 Odyssey EX. We've had it for 4 months, and have had it in the shop three times for a transmission issue: it CLUNKS, then the "D" light starts blinking, and the van continues to shift rough. To be fair, the dealership has given a rental (this one a Sienna! I might trade)</TEXT>

<TEXT>This van is light years ahead of my 2005 Dodge GC in terms of styling, refinement, driving experience, safety, and comfort. It is also light years ahead in terms of monthly payment, but you get what you pay for. My family of six loves it. This vehicle drives wonderfully. Steering is precise and overall handling and maneuverability is fantastic. Backup rear view camera is great once you learn to trust it - much easier to parallel park. I bought this van for many reasons, but Honda's reputation for build quality sealed the deal. I hope it holds up to its reputation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We had debated a mini van for a long time. We purchased a 2006 Civic Hybrid prior to starting foster care...that didn't last long. Shopped around and looked at mini vans from Honda, Toyota, and Kia as well as numerous SUVs and crossovers. Decided on a Used Honda Pilot that was a great vehicle but had some odd problems leading up to a bad climate control system that would have been a pain to fix so the dealership returned our money and we were on the verge of just going up to an 2008 Pilot when we stumbled back into the Odyssey on the showroom. Needless to say, we took it out again and were sold. Not sure why I waited so long! Great ride, lots of room, and great style...</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased it at a reasonable price ($2400 below invoice found in Yahoo and Edmunds, primarily because of the $2300 incentive Honda provided to dealers). Traded in my 2001 Civic. I have no doubt that this is a fabulous vehicle. Drives like Camry, even my wife who scared of driving any vehicle bigger than her Camry can handle it easily. Most amazing is the gas mileage. Before 1000 miles, it is 19.75 miles/gallon (50% highway + 50% local); After 1000 miles, it is improved to 21.75 and then 22.3. </TEXT>

Seats 8 comfortably (3 kids in the back, 1 in a car seat) and 3 adults in the 2nd row. It was a little tight for the adults, but not uncomfortable.

<TEXT>We thought the car was great when test driving, but after putting 1,500 miles on it, we are already looking to replace this Odyssey. Too many problems have surfaced and leave us wondering where is the Honda quality? Already serviced for steering spline noise issue and wheel alignment (neither issue corrected completely). Engine knock/ping at low rpms (premium gas does not help), front window rattle, mysterious transmission noise when shifting into drive, and one of the most uncomfortable driver's seats for long trips. This replaced a 2000 Dodge Caravan with perfect initial build quality, but unfortunately recently totaled by another car. </TEXT>
