<TEXT>Bought new, oil leak, difficult for dealer to determine source. Eventually block replaced. Paint does not match. Fenders do not meet bumpers as well as one would expect in a top of the line Toyota. I would never buy this car again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well 25,000 miles later, I still like the car. I don't love it, but very close. It's a huge step up from my 2008 Camry (which was a great car, just not comfortable enough on the long trips). I'd like to see the finish get tougher in the newer models. My paint seems very easy to scratch. Stock tires are getting near replacement. Most folks who ride in the car... love it! I will have a trip coming up, where we will have 4 adults and we'll be putting on 3,000 - 4,000 in the 2 weeks vacation, and then folks can tell me what they think of the car. I WILL be looking to trade it at the end of the year, as I will have somewhere between 30,000 - 40,000 miles on it. 2010 Avalon, time will tell.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought it used a few weeks ago after much research, thought, and comparisons. I am 59 years old, and have owned many cars. My favorite up to this point was a 1998 Lincoln Continental. I had 90% decided the Avalon Touring was as close as I would ever get to my old continental, so I finally went to try one out. The minute I hit the highway, I knew this was the one. I couldn't be happier after three weeks and 1500 miles. Perfect car for me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Size and comfort level. I am a big guy. 6-0 245 pounds. Car is fine. The touring model doesn't "float", so the Ride is great. Not sporty, but not "old man" feeling either.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Avalon XLS I bought in 1998 now has 180,000 miles and is going strong. I hoped to repeat this performance with my new 2008 Avalon Limited. The Toyota quality is just no longer there. Problems include road noise, whining and jerking transmission, seats uncomfortable and squeaking, GPS is totally worthless, paint quality is horrible, rear sunshade activates for no reason, console is obtrusive, limited visibility for backing, and much more. I would advise avoiding Toyota until they return to building great cars like those of ten years ago.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love this car, navigation is a pain with the little wheel, should be touch screen. Metal is a little cheap got stuck in snow went to push on trunk by Toyota name and trunk bent in tow spots was $100 to get dents taken out. Got nitrogen in tires and during summer I average about 42.5 mpg on highway. Exterior does scratch at the slightest touch. Trunk was scratched by a box touching the trunk. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We spent many months studying what was available in full-size sedans (I wanted a Cadillac). After 18 months of ownership, we are so pleased about our beautiful Avalon! We get compliments all the time. We live in mountains, but still maintain mid-20 mpg; a road trip easily gets us 35 mpg! I get the comfort of a Cadillac, but for considerably less cost, and definitely better mpg! I'm still not sold on leather upholstery, but that is just me. We would recommend this car to anyone looking for a full size car: beauty, great gas mileage, comfort, luxury feel but for less money; A great car!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned 2 Honda Accord Limited then changed to Camry Limited in 2005. Loved it but decided to upgrade to the Avalon in 2008. I absolutely LOVE the comfort, quiet ride, "giddy-up" when you need to move, but can't agree more with the other reviewers that Toyota needs to REIMBURSE ALL OF US WHO WASTED THE MONEY ON THE GPS! IT IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST SYSTEM!!!! Completely unfriendly. I had the touchscreen version on my Camry and it was much better. Better to buy a NUVI- just bought an 885T and LOVE IT! Significantly cheaper than the MAJOR RIPPOFF OF TOYOTAS SYSTEM!!!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like the quiet ride. Seats are comfortable but with my long legs I would prefer for the seat to go back more. The GPS totally stinks, don't blow your money on it, I have a 200 dollar GPS for my other car that is WAY easier to use. The traction control should have a manual override button. I got stuck on the hill going up my driveway in an ice storm and needed a bit more wheel spin, the traction control did not allow it. I love the headlights for brightness but just found out that the replacement bulbs are $325 EACH and yes I did say $325 EACH. Both went out at once at 50,000 miles and neither the basic warranty or the extended warranty covers it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet ride, gas MPG - 24-25 normal driving, and 28-31 hwy depending on how much I stick my foot in it. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased this 2008 Avalon replacing a 2001 BMW 530i. the Avalon is NOT a BMW. On the other hand, it burns the same amount of "regular" fuel, is very comfortable to drive, has great traction in snow, and has more bells and whistles than the 530. The BMW cost a fortune to service (yes, the BMW folks are as polite and pleasant as all heck as they charge $150 for an oil change) and I am hoping that the Toyota does not. The fit and finish are equal and the Avalon cost about $20,000 less. Am I happy? you bet I am</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been driving my 08 Avalon Limited for just over a year & have 20k on it thus far. Overall I am quite pleased. I've had zero mechanical problems. This car is supremely comfortable to drive & ride in - easily equal to my wife's Lexus. I commute 30 miles each way daily and this car makes the trip very pleasant. Comfort is excellent for 5 adults. Interior is outstanding but with a few cheap materials (plastic doors on console). I'm 6'4" & 250 and have good space. Center console is a bit intrusive. Buy Garmin 700-800 GPS and save $2k. It's stupid not to include a back-up camera as standard equipment on a Limited.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth, quiet & luxurious. Fantastic interior comfort. Drive train is outstanding. Lots of power & amazingly smooth with surprisingly good economy. I drive fast and I have averaged about 24 mpg overall. In town 20-24 mpg, on the highway 22-32 mpg. Outstanding value in a car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>2008 Toyota Avalon Limited. Great car, good looking, very nice ride. However with the traction control there is no way to disengage. In snow/Ice sometimes you need to spin your wheels. Once the traction control engages it shuts down the power and wheel spin. great for some things, terrible in the snow when you need wheel spin. Other than that, no complaints.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought mine in Jun 08. The car has a great ride and impeccable interior design. It is quiet and the seats are super comfy. I like the all-power seat options and the full-size spare tire. The bluetooth needs some re-working - it has too much static. The CD-changer and sound are great! The heated seats have been a lifesaver especially on those frigid winter mornings of NE PA. There's so much leg room in this car- especially for the back seats (cramped back-seating is the reason I shied away from a Volvo. Fuel efficiency is not bad for a 3.5L engine- am averaging 25-28 mpg. BUT- the navigation is the worst! What was Toyota thinking!! It's awkward, difficult and tedious- and it's not touchscreen</TEXT>

<TEXT>Responsive engine and lots of good and convenient features. Gets good mileage for a big car. Not too big for "an around town car." Only beef is the car wanders/tracks the rain grooves on a concrete freeway at freeway speed. Feels like you're hydroplaning. Dealer and Toyota of America say this is a "characteristic" of the car and there is no fix. Long distance driving leaves me up tight and hanging on for dear life. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plenty of power from the V6 for any situation. Reasonably comfortable and all controls in convenient reach. Plenty of trunk room. Nice sound system. Quiet ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My Toyota 2008 Avalon limited is an excellent car with a few exceptions. The front seat is tight for a larger driver and the center console makes it impossible to spread you right leg which is so important on long drives. The navigation system is poor at best. It is difficult to use and not as friendly as $300 add ons. The laser cruise control is wasted money as it is far too conservative for normal highway driving. I normally over ride it. My last concern is the low ground clearance. Already I had to reattach the front underbody protection from being ripped lose several times on parking "stops." I believe the clearance is only 5.3 inches which is really pretty low.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, not the quality I expected from a Toyota. I previously had a Volvo S80 and it was a much better built car than the Toyota is. The interior plastic trim is very cheap. At first it looks like brushed metal, but it is just painted plastic that scratches very easily. The seats are not that comfortable for what is considered to be a large car. The body side molding chips very, very easily.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving my 2007 Camry for 38,000 miles, it was time to get something a bit more comfortable. After having 3 Park Avenues (one of which I put 303,000 on), which are VERY comfortable cars, I was very unhappy with the Camry in the comfort area. I LOVE my Avalon Touring Sedan - so far. Comfortable, quiet, looks nice inside and out. Heck, I'm thinking of up-grading to a Limited with all of the bells and whistles. :) It's very early and my MPG isn't all that great (21-23 +/-), but I'll gladly give up a bit of MPG for the rest of the package. Yes I WOULD tell anyone to purchase one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am in outside sales and drive approx 25k per yr. I purchase a new car every 3.5-4 yrs and usually purchase fords. I am a big guy and never thought to look to Toyota for just that reason. I was looking for a car that I could get 5 yrs or 125k+ out of and have it be worth a few thousand dollars when I'm done (hopefully this is it). I am 6'2" and over 290 lbs and I am more comfortable in this car than I was in my ford f-150 that I traded from as I don't feel "beat up" at the end of a long ride. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for room/comfort. Still to early to speak to reliability but time will tell. So far avg 24.5- 27.5 mpg city/hwy combined.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After seven BMWs and several other German cars we got smart. No more arrogant service department and $1500 bills to fix something. We upgraded to the Avalon. A summer vacation trip with four adults and lots of luggage saw mileage range from 29 to a high 36 MPG on regular. The rear reclining seats are worth the price of admission. The 'Bluetooth' is simple to set up and use. Best of all is the interior room and comfortable ride. We are a very tall family (I'm 6' 2" and the shortest one). After @18000 miles we have had NOTHING that needed fixing or adjusting</TEXT>

<TEXT>Need car after 10 yrs w/Infiniti. Considered many others, 4 & 6 cyl. Avalon smoothest suspension & plenty of amenities; seems as if it's on Lexus LS platform, w/o the price or quite the cache-but also w/o premium gas requirement. Avg > 30 mpg on my first highway drive & overall ave. ~ 24.5 miles per gallon in mixed city and hwy driving. JBL 12 spkr very nice. Highly recommend. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ton of space in rear seating area and trunk. Glides over bumps and cruises nicely. You trade a little performance, but I'm ready for a smoother ride and a softer suspension. It's about as big as the big Lexus, Mercedes S or BMW 7 series, but w/o the expense and and headaches. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was so thrilled to purchase an Avalon Limited in October 2007. It was everything I wanted in a luxury car, except for the battery. In April 2008 when I went out to start it the battery was dead and the car had to be towed. Again in September 2008 the exact same thing happened, except this time rusty water was also dripping out of exhaust, which could not be explained. Even though the work was done under warranty, I am now nervous when I go out of town for fear it will not start. Other than this problem it is a great car. Wish I could feel at ease with it again. </TEXT>

My family has owned Toyotas since 1971 and some members even drive the LS460.

Ride a little firm on long trips I feel a little beat up. Fuel economy is good not great. I had an 03 STS that I drove 116,000 miles and it was a great car fun to drive much more comfortable and less tinny than this.

<TEXT>We are a a family of 5 & needed more room. Traded a 2006 Honda Accord Hybrid in for our loaded Avalon after 2 years of trouble-free Honda ownership. The Avalon isn't nearly as fun to drive, and you're not quite as "connected" to the driving experience, but it's the clear winner for our family. Lots of room to stretch out, excellent stereo, great mileage, huge trunk, tons of value for the price and legendary Toyota quality. I often wonder why anyone would pay the extra money to buy a Lexus GS 350 when this car really seems to have everything you could possibly want in a sedan. I shopped both before making the decision to buy the Avalon. I do prefer the rear styling of the Lexus over this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall this car screams value for the money with unparalleled quality. Excellent features include quiet ride, flat rear floor, powertrain, excellent fuel economy on regular gas, JBL audio, ventilated front seats, auto wipers & HID headlights, large trunk, keyless entry/start & Blizzard white paint.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just recently purchased a 2008 Avalon Limited and I just love it. The car rides very smooth. The interior is very sleek and modern looking with its brushed chrome compartments and stylish dashboard and gauges. The leather seats are also very plush and comfortable. Easily the Toyota Avalon has a huge advantage when comparing everything that comes standard that would have cost thousands more on a Lexus ES. I searched for over a year and there was no other vehicle I found that offered the interior room and standard features for such an affordable price. Thanks Toyota for building my dream car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Up to when I bought the Avalon I had never heard about it but when I first saw it in the showroom I fell in love with it. It has not disappointed me. I've already taken it on a 3100+ mile trip and it drives just the way I want a car to drive: a good solid, comfortable, and predictable feeling. I don't need a lot of gadgets in the car to keep me happy so the Avalon has plenty to keep me occupied. I consider the styling simple, or classic, so it will look good 10 or 20 years from now. Power is excellent and my mpg on the 3100+ 10-day trip was 29.83 over all which included 4 days of city driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Avalon Limited. The car seats five full-size adults in comfort, with heated and cooled front seats, a terrific stereo, bluetooth connectivity, dynamic laser cruise control, and a respectable navigation system. Controls are easy to use (except the nav joystick) and the car is aesthetically pleasing inside and out. The ride is generally smooth, but suffers over rough pavement. The six speed gearbox and engine are smooth as silk. The exterior noise level is phenomenally low, and the gas mileage is exceptional for a car this size. Essentially, a near equivalent to a Lexus GS, with more legroom, better gas mileage, and more storage space, for $20,000 less. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My Avalon is probably the best vehicle I have ever owned. I traded in a 2004 BMW high performance 330I on this car (I loved that car but it was impractical for my family). This car has 33 more horsepower, dual exhaust, tons more room, only weighs 150 more lbs. than the Beemer, hands free phone, comfort is excellent, it's very quiet and feels very safe on the road.

Big problem is the paint on the hood. Tiny chips have been appearing and the car only has 11,000 on it. My 2001 Tahoe has zero chips on hood and 136,000 miles on it.

<TEXT>Had an '03, loved it. From the specs the '08 should be even better. It is in every way except the ride. If you're on smooth blacktop fine, any other surface you will feel via the seat each tar strip, pavement crack, bump, and if you hit a hole... oh my! I drive 55 Ca. freeway miles a day. Hate the ride every mile. Suspension way too stiff for Toyota's luxury flagship, just jar & jolt. 17" wheels don't help either. 16" means more absorbing rubber and a softer ride. They need to quit trying to build cars to satisfy the specification desires of some auto magazines testers whose standards are usually race track handling, the biggest wheels & lots of hpwr. The Avalon isn't a sports car! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The option package for the Limited is the only way to go. A/C through the seats... ahh! Great stereo, comfy seats, auto backseat sunshade, keyless entry, plenty of power, getting about 24 MPG, huge trunk & glove box, bluetooth for telephone, MP3 plays through stereo.

<TEXT>I've previously owned a Camry and recently traded my Solara for the 2008 Avalon. I have no complaints. I am a tall women and there's plenty of leg/head room, 3 avg sized adults fit comfortably in the back seat, tons of trunk space, and good price. Horsepower and handling are great. I can zoom uphill, through traffic and curves with ease. Avalon luxury is, at its best, highly comparable to Lexus without the price tag. It's a smooth, quiet, spacious ride - especially when you have a long commute to work everyday. Best car purchase I've made to date. The exterior design is beautiful. I am constantly being approached with compliments. I would recommend the Avalon to all.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Proof Toyota can badge and sell any clunker. 13.6 mpg in Boston, 25 mpg on hilly I-90. I am not a heavy foot. I use premium & Mobil-1 5W30. The seats jiggle over bumps. The back doors need to be rehung. Accelerating and maneuvering make dangerous torque steer, I like the 3/4 large size and big interior space, but seats not comfortable on a long drive, even for driver, in spite of adj lumbar. I've had a lot of great cars recently, everything from an 06 Evo IX SE to a Camry Hybrid. I like big cushy cars. An old chassis and should be retired. Paint scratches if you frown at it. There are lots of goods cars out there, this is not one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is truly a luxurious car that makes driving an enjoyable experience. It is extremely quiet and smooth shifting with almost no wind noise. I use regular gas on the highway and can get almost 30 miles to the gallon. The seats are heated and very comfortable. It also has an excellent stereo radio and CD system that you can control on the steering wheel. There is no need to spend more, unless you are a status seeker.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you have a shopping requirement for lots of room, fuel efficiency, 5-star NHTSA ratings all around, Toyota-like reliability & resale value you may find the list is quite short as I did. A 3600lb sedan with true seating for 5, 95mph 1/4 mile trap, and real world 32mpg regular in rural driving seems like a contradiction to me but this car is proof otherwise. Comfort and performance are well documented and all of it is true. Fun to drive of 8 because I find myself looking forward to driving it almost as much as old RX-8. Only 2 things wrong with the car so far if picky: the rain sensing wipers don't activate in misty conditions and the wood panel on driver door is misaligned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Keyless entry and start is great if you always find yourself carrying things and fumbling for the keys. A rear sunshade should be standard on all cars. At first wary of the dynamic cruise control, but now I use it all the time in lighter traffic. It works very well. Headlights work very well too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car has a nice ride, but in the 6 months of ownership, the dash has several rattles, and I have noticed several misaligned panels. I wish the dash was not so far forward or large, the front seat area needs to be larger for longer trips. I love the controls, but not the gray paint of the hidden radio panel. The ride is the best feature. I drove a 2008 ford taurus recently, and the ride felt more solid and flat, like a german car, and was just as nice as the toyota. Wish I knew about that car earlier.</TEXT>

On a 300 mile trip, with the last 100 miles through the Tahoe Mountains, I still had 29.3mpg. That's something to brag about in a car that will put you back in the seat when you need it most! Very well done!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you are looking or a true luxury large car with lots of room at a reasonable price, this is it. Not another competitor can come close and you get it with Toyota reliability and quality. Styling could be improved but if Toyota did that then there truly is no reason to buy a Lexus LS. Seems same reasoning went into nav system. Portable GPS has touch screen for less than $200 now. This one doesn't. Lexus GPS does. If Toyota cleaned up a few very low cost details there would be no reason for the Lexus brand. Toyota's challenge is keeping the "goodness" of this product away from their prospective Lexus customers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Fun to drive, ride is smooth and good but I don't care for the jump seat on front passenger side. The cushion you sit on is too short, they should have made the passenger seat like the driver seat, on a long trip it is irritating and uncomfortable. The seats could have used more padding. I like the way the car handles and the mileage is great. The exterior of the car could be sportier.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We replaced our 2001 Avalon XLS with the 2008 and are extremely satisified with it. Ride, handling, comfort, fuel economy and Toyota reliability are superb! We both have back problems and this is one of the few cars that we can sit and drive without pain and discomfort. The 8 way power heated seats with power adjustable lumbar support on both sides are a big plus too. After owning a 2001 Avalon, we did not consider anything else. Why drive a Lexus and pay 10-15,000 more just for the "L" on the exterior. Previous cars include BMW 525, Mercedes E300, Chrysler 300M and we would not go back to driving any of those again for a number of reasons.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Pros: Push Button Start/Stop, Mileage, Power w/6 speed Auto Trans, Roomy Cons: Soft Breaks, External Looks (there's nothing special about the design) I bought an Avalon Limited 2008 in November of 07. I think this car is great. The mileage on regular gasoline is around 26 mpg (I drive mostly highway). Before this car, I had a 2001 BMW 330i. So the avalon seems not very responsive to cornering and "hugging" the road. However, an avalon is more of a cruising car...and not a performance car. I would say the acceleration is more then enough (and actually comparable to my old BMW) however, take the turns slow as slow as the avalon will lean when taking a sharp turn. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Push Button Start/Stop, Mileage, Power w/6 speed Auto Trans, Roomy If you can live without a luxury name (lexus, bmw, etc), this car is great choice. For the money, you will get the most options and feel as though you are driving a $45,000 car for only $35,000. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We previously owned a '96 Avalon, and were very pleased with it. This car, however, is superior in almost every way. We tested against Lexus, Infiniti M, Acura: for features, performance, fuel economy, and price this was the correct decision. This is an outstanding automobile. The styling is a bit stodgy, and the navigation system a bit cumbersome, but these minor drawbacks are more than made up for with comfort, engine response, fuel economy for the HP, and overall integrity/fit and finish. I spent ~3 years researching this choice, and we made the right one. Nice going, Toyota!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove a 1996 Acura 3.2TL before buying the Avalon after comparing new Nissan Maxima, slightly used Acura RL 2006, slightly used Infiniti M35. What sold me was the comfortable and quiet ride and the available feature set. It didn't hurt that Toyota takes regular gas AND gets better mileage than other large cars. I don't understand the other reviewer citing difficulty with entry/exit into the car; seems like that's something one would notice prior to purchase and, if it is that significant of a problem, look elsewhere. The car rocks; great stereo, silky transmission, great power, bluetooth is easy to use, still learning navigation, but seems intuitive enough. Overall, A+</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a '99 Avalon and now '08. New Avalon has smooth and solid ride and gives sense of safety. Turning radius is tight for a big car and this is a plus. I miss the bench seat in the '99. Entry and exit on new Avalon is terrible. I am female-5'6" (sr) and have to practically back in to enter and swing my legs out (they still hit the side of car) to exit. Door is too big and heavy. Toyota might be trying to appeal to younger buyer and may lose seniors if high beltline, heavy doors and entry/exit are not improved. My husband who is 5'11" cannot get into this car without extensive planning and exact maneuvering-not enough leg room for driver. Need more room in front-not back</TEXT>

<TEXT>I tried to talk myself into the LS 460 or the ES350. It came down to the ES, and I decided to save 10000 and still got a superior vehicle: more bells and whistles, better ride, more room (even larger in back seat than the 460) better gas mileage (average for us is almost 29) more power, regular gas. The car is so smooth, the only thing I downgraded was "fun to drive". I have a back problem and traded a cadillac to get something really comfortable. This is it. My last three cars have been Cadillac SRX, Infiniti Q45, and Lexus LS 400. The Limited Avalon is superior to the Caddy, and equivalent of the 400 and 430 and Q45. I cannot believe I got this much car for this price. </TEXT>

The laser cruise control is awesome once you get use to it. I will have the body side molding installed once Toyota finds a new vendor. We also own a 2002 Highlander and Toyota quality and service cannot be matched. This is the best value on the road for a quality full size vehicle. I have driven the lexus and aside from expensive options this car is as good as if not better than the Lexus.

<TEXT>A great car. Fit and finish are superb. When the door shuts, you feel encapsulated in your own world. Our three daughters love the back seat and think the reclining feature is the coolest thing. I'm impressed with fuel economy thus far. After 1000 miles, I am averaging 26 MPG city/highway. The engine has plenty of power, but the transmission seems to search for the proper gear when the gas pedal is mashed. Not an unsafe feeling, but car seems uncertain of how or when to shift. Ride is smooth and quiet. Despite being the Touring model, I wouldn't consider this a sports sedan. However, handling for a car this size is adequate. I do wish it had an integrated compass. Very happy overall. </TEXT>

I have had five previous Toyotas, including a 2000 Avalon. I had forgotten what the overall Toyota experience was like. This Avalon should withstand weather, bad roads and any other element that can be thrown at it. My XL is loaded with about every option available and was a little pricy. However, I feel the vehicle will outlast and outperform any other car in its class. I even checked out the C-class Mercedes and it wasn't even close.
