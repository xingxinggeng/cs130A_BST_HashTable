<TEXT>I've had this car for 15 months and 18k miles. It is a fun car and until recently I would recommend it to anyone. I've had a few things go wrong that should never be an issue, especially for a Japanese car. Some are minor, some are not: * The plastic battery box cover broke the first time I opened it. * The gas cap broke, with part of it stuck on the filler tube. * The clutch is not working right. Something inside the clutch assembly broke causing poor engagement/disengagement of the clutch, which is felt as a notchy, clicking sensation in the pedal. The actually clutch friction plate is fine (this is not an issue due to poor manual driving skills). * Stock tires only lasted 17.5K.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first car and it has met and superseded all my expectations. As all others I love the handling and the acceleration is great. It looks great, a lot better than the new 2010 (smiley face and ugly tail lights). I have driven 27,000 miles in one year and it runs great with no problems. Get a car bra to protect the paint if you drive on highways often, otherwise it will surely get chipped. The tires are a bit skittish in wet conditions although was fine in snow and I live New England.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had my Mazda 3 for 1.5 years now. Great turning radius-so fun to drive on country roads. The car has a lot of pep even though on Highways when you really need the acceleration it can be lacking (it is only a 4 cylinder:)) I love the design of the car, especially the back end. I do not like the way the '10's look at all as they have tinkered with the unique exterior. Overall, the car handles great and is fun to drive around the city but good for longer trips too. I tried to save money and buy the base model which was a huge mistake (but not mazdas fault). No key fob, no power windows, no power locks, no cruise control, no bose etc etc... Next time!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great handing, turning radius, trunk space is not huge but decent for a car this small. Overall just fun to drive. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I"m writing my review after the thrill of new car ownership has faded. I'm happy with the car in general, but there have been a few problems. The brakes are still extremely squeaky even after 7500 miles. The dealer changed the front brake pads but this had no effect. Secondly, there is still a noticeable catalytic converter smell if you go to the back of the vehicle after turning it off in the garage. The dealer claims there is a break in period for this. How long, I wonder?? There is no area for a purse if you choose to use the driver side cup holder. Finally, the car handles badly in snow. The small incline to my garage is impossible to manage with even the smallest amount of snow.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The trunk organizer is excellent for managing groceries. The audio controls on the steering wheel are great, esp when a teen passenger is attempting to control the audio! Really fun to drive and parking is a breeze.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 2008 Mazda3 is a typical 4-door sedan with an atypical drivetrain. From the line, the car gets decent acceleration, easily capable of bypassing the ridiculous Atlanta drivers (regardless of type of car) from a dead stop. Handling is great, with a fantastic turning radius and the great ability to carve corners at speed. Interior design is nice, the sound system is very good, and there isn't enough road noise to be distracting from a conversation, even on the highway. The only real gripe I have is fuel economy, but I knew this before I chose to purchase the car. As a 23-year-old professional, this car suits my needs without being flashy or expensive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Aux jack on base model! Nice design cues, have gotten compliments on my stock (clear) tail lights. Mazda has engine design to a science, which beats the Corolla and Civic hands-down. Nice handling carves corners. Glove box holds most 15" and 17" in laptops and locks. Auto-stick mode!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my 3 series BMW for the 08 S-GT Hatchback . Got it loaded with the Bose Audio, front Spoiler and the base accessories are mind boggling , Xenons, Leather , Roof , Power all around , heated seats . It was an outstanding value and now that they changed the body in 2009 I realize what a masterpiece of beauty this body style is. Designed By the Jaguar designer and he did a top notch job I must say. It launches with ease cruises at 90 not even breathing and has the suspension to match.After I hit 30K had the fuel injectors clean'd and the throttle body and after that the car was like new and started giving me an extra 3 mpg on the fwy with more power. Dealer said stop using 91 it worked!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got interested in the new 2010 Mazda 3, but test-drove the car and didn't like the interior or rear-quarter blind spots at all. Got interested in the old-generation ("leftover") '08 and '09 Mazda 3s still on the lot, drove one, and liked it much better -- especially on the inside. Made a great deal on a loaded '08. I think this is the class of the small-Asian-sedan segment -- more distinctive than the Corolla or Civic and streets ahead of the Sentra in terms of comfort, performance and amenities. It's roomy up front (not so much in back), quick off the line, great in the corners, and styled like a bargain-basement BMW. Worthy competitor to Jetta at less cost, better build quality.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling, responsive 2.3L engine, supportive seats, tight handling. Decisive, solid-feeling manual transmission. It's a high- content car for the price: DSC, Xenons, heated leather seats, Bose stereo, 6-CD in-dash, trip computer, compass in mirror, electronic climate control, much more. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded my 2002 Miata SE for this car. Wanted an all season car without giving up much handling and fun to drive. Shopped Civic Si, WRX, Altima Coupe, Mazdaspeed 3 and GTI; chose a Mica Copper Red Mazda3s Touring 5M for price, fuel mileage (premium fuel not required) and versatility. Figured I was making a compromise for enconomics sake. My 1st drive was over a winding mountain pass here in Montana and I haven't smiled like that since I got the Miata. Of course it doesn't have the kick in the pants acceleration of a WRX or V-6 Nissan, but the handling and transmission is more then up to the task. I'm 6'4" (yes I fit in the Miata) and found the front seats as comfortable as any I tested.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did research for a couple years prior to deciding on a Mazda 3. My mom had owned the 323 and a Protege for as long as they've been around, and this Mazda 3 has the same peppy driving feel. It's small, but feels so roomy inside. The handling is fantastic and feels like a much pricier sports car, especially around the turns. I've only had it for a month, but am absolutely in love with it! It's getting around 30 MPG but that's mostly been in the city, not highway. If you want a cute, sporty car, that's fun to drive and an incredible value, this won't disappoint!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Aurora Blue s touring hatch! I just bought it a couple days ago and feel that it is the best. It is so cute, sporty, luxurious and fun. Road noise is not an issue and it's quieter with less wind noise than my father's 10 year old avalon that cost more money. It's great on the highway too. The engine makes a satisfying sporty growl. When you press the unlock button twice, all doors plus the hatch open. This car beats all of the competition and is the best value for the money</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a more fuel efficient vehicle than my Toyota Sequoia. I've always owned Toyotas and test drove the new '09 Matrix. I wasn't impressed with the responsiveness or the overall looks. I test drove the Mazda 3 and was immediately impressed. The 3 has a very sporty look, it's comfortable, responsive, handles well, holds the road well in curves and has lots of features standard safety and otherwise. This car has more standard features than the Matrix such as stereo & cruise control on the steering wheel, and 17" alloy wheels. I sacrificed a little gas mileage between the Matrix 1.8L 4 speed and the Mazda 2.3L 5 speed but I ended up with a car that's a lot more fun to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were looking for a new vehicle with good gas mileage that uses regular fuel, has a best of class reliability and some personality! I believe the Mazda3 hits the mark. We have only had the car for about seven weeks. The factory radio had a problem with the volume (the bass would cut out at higher levels). Our dealership checked into a possible software glitch and replaced our radio with a brand new corrected unit. My radio works and sounds great now. This is our very first Mazda and we are looking forward to many happy problem free miles. Driving this car makes me smile. I love my little wagon! To all Mazda3 owners you choose a nice car!

<TEXT>I bought the Mazda 3i 4dr 2.0. And it's a great car. Handling is amazing. Ride quality is firm but absorbant. Road noise is also low. Pretty good power. Fuel economy is about 25-28 mpg. good engine. smooth trasmission. Interior is beutiful, exterior styling is unique and attractive, i pod jack built in. Im 6'2 and fit comfortably except my right leg very close to console. I sold hondas and toyotas this car exceeds both civic and corolla in overall value. This car offers more performance better looks and far better handling for less. Can't beat that.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked at several small cars mainly due to the high fuel prices. The Mazdas always were rated excellent. Also we had a Mazda 323 forever with no problems. After test driving several cars I kept coming back to the Mazda3. I'm not sure if it's because it looks so good, or because it's so much fun to drive. We looked at used ones, but they were close to the price of a new one, so we bought new. So far we love it! 1st tank calculated 25.8 MPG with that being about 60% city driving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love Mazda vehicles to begin with. They are one of the few car manufacturers that actually build 99% of their cars in Japan. The quality shows. I was very skeptical about a 4cyl. engine with an automactic. The 2.3L with the 5 speed auto is an absolute blast to drive. The 6 speed Miata was a blast to drive, but try commuting 70+ miles a day in LA's freeway traffic. The fit and finish is s good as any BMW 3 series, and the performance will make you wonder why you need to spend an extra 15K on a Bimmer. I have owned them as well. First thing I did after I had 1500 miles was change the oil to Royal Purple, K&N oil filter and K&N air filter. I know the car doesn't need this.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I took my time and test-drove almost every Asian or European car in the small-sedan class but the 3i Touring stood out. Now that I've had it for 3 months and taken one long trip (2000 miles), I'm more convinced than ever I made the right choice. The competition's cars are either fun or economical, never both. This car is. I've been getting over 30 in the city and over 40 highway, up to 44 mpg! Not a fast car but zippy and very nimble. Wow. Absolutely get the stick. The worst problem is road noise but every car this size has it so I guess it's just part of the deal. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Researched similar vehicles to death, but having owned 2000 and 2002 Proteges with no unscheduled maintenance problems, the 2008 was a no-brainer. It's fast enough, handles as if on rails, driver's seat and position are a great fit. Averaging 34 mpg in mixed Spring driving (I coast a lot downhill). Owner oil and filter changes are not difficult if you have ramps that are not steeply angled. Trade your premium fuel burners. It would be difficult not to like the value in the Mazda3. </TEXT>

The black interior takes a little extra effort to keep clean. The swifter duster is the best thing to clean the dash with.

<TEXT>--A+-- I researched cars for months drove 1/2 dozen others in the class, Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Kia and ended up selling myself on a Mazda3 before I ever drove one. Started out considering larger vehicles, but when gas prices shot up once again and my path was clear, I commute 60 miles a day and had to consider mileage. When I did test drive my Mazda3 it was clear, this was my car, only decision left was color. Problem now is that I like it so much I don't want to put big miles on it so fast (this was a replacing my 1999 nissan P/U which already has over 170,000/miles!). I've started sharing the commute load between all 3 of my cars so the Mazda3 is in my driveway for years</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought an 08.5 Mazda3 Sport Hatchback after a dump truck trashed my 2006 Mazda3 I-Touring Sedan. They call it 08.5 because of a model change mid-year. I went to the dealer to buy another Mazda 3 I-Touring but the Copper Red color of the hatchback caught my attention. It steers and accelerates very nicely and definitely fun to drive. It makes my 100 mile daily commute bearable. As far as MPG, I've gotten, 28, 29 and 30 MPG. I'm not usually interested in a hatchback but the styling is sporty and far better than the Toyota Matrix and Honda Fit. I checked out the Honda Civic coup also and the roominess and interior didn't match the Mazda. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the car for 2 months (sometime in that 2 months they started calling it a wagon, not a hatch?). I bought it in Feb, during some of the worst driving weather possible, and it handled as though it were a dry sunny day. I love the performance, and the stability control in the Touring model really helps grip the road (we have some tricky ones in the mountains). My husband loved it so much he bought the same in an automatic, which also handles beautifully. We wish we got better mileage (I get about 27 mpg) for a small car, but the emissions ratings are good. We recently had 3 teens, 2 adults, and all the teens' college gear in the Mazda, no problem!! Cargo space is great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car handles fabulously! I've owned great handling cars for years (BMW 528, Nissan Zs, Mustang GTs, etc.). This car can hold its own with any of them--that makes it worth it for me. However, it is not perfect. I've had some problems, such as air bag system failure, peculiar engine noises at idle, and paint chipping. It also has lots of road noise as well. Also, gas mileage is good but not great (24 mpg overall). I bought this car for my wife as a supplemental car to her Mustang GT convertible (didn't want to drive it in bad weather). It serves well in that role. Overall, I would recommend this car, but you need to understand what you are getting.</TEXT>

<TEXT>At 53 sold my impractical touring motorcycle so I needed some sport w/practicality. Drove VW Rabbit, but 2.3 Mazda 3 was smoother and have owned both in the past, Mazda more reliable. Most important is Electronic Stability Control, have not been able to get it to skid, it is like glued to the road like a Porsche 911 but more balanced. Precise steering. Acceleration is good, better than I expected and it is fun to pass 3 cars at a time on two lane highway. Needed manual and sun roof to keep sport feeling but is clumsy with cell phone in traffic. Very quiet at hwy speeds, 3,050 rpm at 70 in 5th, redlines at 6,500 rpm (top 149 mph??). S Touring has lots of features, cruise, etc. Doors solid.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Build quality, features for under $20m. Sport handling and good power with manual since power really kicks in above 5m rpm. This is a real sports car. Auto volume of stereo to road. Love the hatch versatility, can put seats down and carry a big TV. Av. 26.81 cty/hwy mpg with good power.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is great, the underpinnings are derived from a Volvo s40. The design of the interior looks good and is functional along with the multiple airbags and H beam overhead for rollover protection. The exterior looks great. The engine has plenty of power for the vehicle and tranny doesn't shuffle around for gears, the manual feature is great too. As far as the suspension and brakes are conserned they exceed my expectations by far. For a fwd you can't beat the handling. Overall this car is definitely worth the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was shopping for a new car, had a 98 Honda Accord for 11 years, needed something sporty and fresh. I really liked the styling of the Mazda 3 and was attracted to the many features and 156 HP. Love at first sight at the dealership, took it for a test drive and was impressed by the tight handling of this car. Have put about 800 miles on it so far, mostly highway miles. I find the mpg is a bit lower than I had hoped for, but it might be that I just can't go slow in this car! So far my best mpg is about 28 when I keep it on cruise control 70mph. So many great features-roomy, stereo is awesome with 6 cd changer, tight cockpit, bright orange instrument panel, safety features-great deal for 17k!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is a blast to drive. The 2.0 has plenty of power, and gets great mpg (over 30). The manumatic is a fun feature, controls for stereo and cruse are located in perfect place on steering wheel. To me and everyone I have talked to it is the nicest looking car in its class, and is on par with much more expensive cars like Jetta and Altima (if not better). It drives like a sports car, the engine sound is clean during acceleration and almost silent when cruising. It has a massive trunk for a small car. The car looks bigger than it is, and I am 6'2'' and I find the front spacious and the back tolerable but tight. Interior lights are red and dash has cool blue shine. Did I mention PZEV engine?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Last week I finally went ahead and purchased this car (5 door Grand Touring). I was a little worried about not having snow tires and being in the midst of winter but it actually is better than my previous ride. The wheels will spin when initially accelerating, but seems to grip the road well after that (I will get snow tires next year since I live in MI). The car is just so much fun to drive. It feels so much like a European car. I am still trying to determine the average MPG. Since I bought the car with 14 miles, the trip computer appears not to have enough data to make an accurate read.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hello to all possible car buyers. If you are looking for a car with style, interior and exterior beauty, performance and even good gas mileage for under 20,000 dollars look no further, this is the car you are going to get. Mazda compares this car to the honda civic and toyota corolla. First of all, bad comparison, the mazda3 surpasses both these cars by far. The mazda3 offers more bang for the buck in every single possible way. You get far more features then both other cars can offer, and these features are included standard, not for extra money. 22/29 is what they say, I've been getting 24.5 miles per gallon,50/50 streets/highway. LOVE the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned Mazda vehicles since 1984 and the 3 series (GLC, 323, Protege, Mazda3) have always been the best when it comes to value, performance, and style in sedans. Bought the "3" to be used by my college-age daughters while Mazda was offering the 0% APR deal (and to avoid the stupid No. VA transportation tax). As with all my Mazda vehicles, the driving position, design, and sporting nature have been retained even in the base model i Sport I purchased. I liked the fact that finding one with ABS and side curtain airbags was not impossible in the base model. My only complaint would be the colors on the instruments. There's just not enough contrast for my 50+ year old eyes.</TEXT>

It has quick acceleration and looks good on inside and out. Love the orange lighting on dash and six disc changer also aux jack is a plus. Glove box is huge and trunk is good size for car. I am getting around 25-28 miles to the gallon, that's with mixed freeway city driving. Engine is a little noisy and first minute of starting up it idles a little rough. I have not noticed much road noise. Takes corners like a champ. Speakers are average, will be replacing with some components soon. If you have extra 5k go with the Grand Touring.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the 2008 Mazda3 Sport for my teenage son based on the excellent safety ratings this car received. I purposely chose the "S" model as side air impact bags were standard. Unfortunately we had the opportunity to test the SRS system in a recent accident which leads me to this review so others are not taken in by the false safety ratings that Mazda publishes. The car suffered significant damage on both passenger side doors and in my case the air bags did not deploy. I suffered serious injuries that could have been prevented if they had. When I called Mazda No. Am. I was told there was no one I could speak with and should persue through a lawyer or my insurance. Beware!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my Mazda 4 Door (with hatch) Grand Touring sedan for two days and am VERY happy to have chosen it over the Toyota Matrix which, although of reputed higher quality, was a total drag to drive. The Mazda is zippy, smooth, and responds quite handily. Of course I won't get quite the mileage, but then I'm coming off a 3500+ lb. mini-van so I'm still way ahead. I have no complaints at all and recommend this vehicle entirely. If you want a fun yet semi-sophisticated car that's just roomy enough for 4 adults in super comfort and is also incredibly cute, this is your vehicle. I got many more features for less money than the Matrix but ended up with a much better and more nimble ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Overall quite satisfied. However, I will say I am not pleased with the silly horn, it sounds like it belongs on a small scooter, maybe a motorized bicycle. The bird chirping horn does not match the quality of the car. And I can't say I am all that pleased with the heater, it takes 15 minutes or better to attain comfort, at which time I am usually at my destination, freezing from the cold. Also, the panic button on the switch fob has a range of about 20 feet. My previous car panic button had a much greater range, helping me find where I parked the car on occasion.

<TEXT>Lots of pluses. Zero issues in 1st 7K mls. List of standard amenities is as long as your arm. Since most the positives are listed in the brochures and Mazda info, I'll focus on the stuff they don't tell you. All cars have negatives. Consider if you can tolerate these: 1. factory speakers are horrible. Replaced all 4 with cheapo $26 speakers, for a major improvement. 2. Even understanding that performance uses gas, mileage is less than expected (26- 29 mpg). 3. Stock tires flat spot after sitting and need to warm up before the tiny thumping goes away. Otherwise stock tire performance and noise is fine so far. No need to slow down and brake for corners. That makes it very fun to drive!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mp3 input gets used a lot. Dash layout and steering wheel controls all work well. Styling is dead on. Hatch space is big enough for a family of 4 to all go to the grocery.

<TEXT>I never thought I'd write an online review, but I simply had to come back and confirm that this car is indeed every bit as good as people say. I needed to get a new car and heavily researched the Mazda3 in addition to the Honda Civic Si, Honda Accord Coupe, Mitsubishi Lancer, Subaru Impreza WRX and BMW 328. As you can tell, price was not so much of a issue for me as getting a car I really liked. I was worried that the Mazda3 was underpowered and too "economy" (i.e. cheap and mundane) for my tastes, but after driving all of the cars mentioned above I was left with little doubts. Without exaggeration, this car drives and handles like a BMW. I could not be happier with the purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior build quality far surpasses all my other choices with the exception of the Accord and BMW. I can't believe I'm driving a sub $20K car.

<TEXT>I have owned this Mazda for four months now and have loved every minute of it. This Mazda hatch has it all compared to other economy cars in its class. Superb interior fit and finish, European inspired exterior, crisp handling, and sporty stance. The Zoom-Zoom of this 3 really differentiates it from all others. The 2.3L loves to be revved and the manual transmission definitely helps squeeze every ounce of power from the four-banger. I was debating whether or not to get the navigation system but decided against it as is not worth the $1500 price tag because it does not even have the touchscreen like the CX-7. At the end of the day, this car is near perfect for the price at around $20K!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The GT trim (seats and door) for a more luxurious feel, Bose sound system, Xenon headlights that definitely light up the whole road, the utility and versatility of the cargo area, heated front seats, and the confidence that it has the same chassis as the Volvo with safety written all over it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had the car about a month now, with a little over 1k in mileage. Once again Mazda has done a very good job on the interior of the car. Overall a nice jump in interior room from the old protege. Only interior gripe I have is that when my legs are the right distance away, my arms feel too far away from the steering wheel. No adjustment left on the telescoping wheel. The old protege just fit. Exterior wise, I just like sport wagons, so this car fits me. Mechanically mileage has been 26-27 mpg mixed driving. I hoped for better, I'm a little disappointed, but I chose sport over economy. The car is fun to drive, handles well, nicely finished for the price, and that's why I'm on my second one</TEXT>

All available speaker systems (bose and stock) stink. Replaced the speakers (but not tweeters), so that's remedied. Aux input works w/ iPod beautifully. 27 mpg thus far which is awesome! No rattles or initial failures the first month. Corners wonderfully. Thus far, no real torque steer under hard acceleration. Great clutch - not on/off or stiff. Awesome brakes, though sometimes I've noticed squeaking. Steering wheel controls work well.</TEXT>

The 3 has much more pep (especially with the manual), is better looking, and has more standard features than the comparable Civic LX. It gets fantastic gas mileage! 1500 miles on our 3, and we're averaging around 30 to 33 mpg with about a 50/50 city/highway driving.

<TEXT>I am writing this review as a mostly happy owner of my new Mazda3. After driving my first 1000 miles of mixed highway/city miles, I am a bit disappointed that all 4 tanks of gas have yielded between 23 and 25 miles per gallon. I realize that the car is rated 22/29. Nonetheless, given the highway split, I am a bit surprised it's coming in at the low end of middle. This is not a large car, and it surprises me somewhat that my 13 year old Corolla with 155,000 miles on it was getting significantly better mileage. For now, I am very happy with the car - it's great fun to drive. But maybe I will end up going for a hybrid in a couple of years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I couldn't be happier with the car so far and I've only done a few hundred miles. The AC works beautifully (I know some people have complained with the '07 model). The back seat area, although small, fits 3 people in the back rather comfortably. When only 2 are in the back, there is a rather wide seat separator with two cup holders. Even the doors have cup holders on the sides! The car is a 4 cyl. car so don't expect crazy acceleration, but it does an amazing job of taking off and accelerating via the manual control from 3 to 4th gears. The car takes turns amazingly. The car is virtually silent while idling. There is also amazing room in the glove comp. I'm very pleased so far!</TEXT>

Every passenger has a handle to hold on to, except the driver of course. Leather steering wheel feels really good. Cargo tray is a must in the back.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Mazda 3, I previously owned an 04 4 door and while the car remains mostly unchanged, it's excitement keeps rising. The included dynamic stability and traction control with this model will be sure to help in the ice and snow, while the moon roof will comfort during the warmer months. The car is absolutely a work of art and I could not think of a better car to get, even for my second go around with it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only about 300 miles on the Mazda. It is fun to drive and handles very well. The steering and suspension is crisp, the brakes are responsive and smooth. My first tank of gas, mostly local suburban driving, was over 28 MPG. The engine runs slightly rough idling while stopped. I was told this is characteristic of a four cylinder engine. It is surprisingly quick off the line. The only other comment I have is that the key fob does not have a button to open the trunk. All doors may be locked and unlocked from the key fob but for some reason they did not include a trunk release which seems like an oversight. The body panels have good fit, finish and integrity. So far I am very pleased.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the moon roof and 6 CD in dash sound system, also the instrumentation and lighting therein. The telescoping tilt wheel is a nice adjustment for varied driving positions. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just got home from the dealership, I really love this car. It's got a sweet interior. I test drove an 07 Civic LX sedan and this had more power, not much by horsepower, but I think the Mazda3 is also lighter, so it has a higher power to weight ratio. Really like the 16" rims and 4 wheel disk brakes. Real fun to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I commute 45 minutes each way to work. Since I bought M3 I find myself getting a earlier start each morning so I can take the back rodes to work. I have 2008 S Touring 5 spd manual and it is a blast to drive. Prior to that I owned a 2004 Mini Cooper w 1.4 liter engine. Mini hugged the curves better but did not have pep that 2,3L engine provides. M3 revs at about 3100rpm at 80 mpg, Mini over 4000. Suspension stiff on both, which I don't mind. M3 looks cool and theirs more room in the back for the kids. M3 doesn't get the gas mileage that Mini did but I can run 87 instead of premium. Trade off is worth it. In my mid forty's but I feels like a kid again when i get in this car.</TEXT>

There is a bit of cabin noise when your on the highway but I usually have the radio up. Overall, I have had no problems with this car and plan to keep it for a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>At the car lot I jumped in the vehicle to take it for a drive. It seems very very sluggish and was not at all impressed. Then I noticed the brake light was on!!!!!! Well, after taking the E-brake off I realized this car had some serious zip. It handled better than any of my two other previously owned vehicles. I was sold. Last summer I took the vehicle from Oregon to Yellowstone in Montana. When I hit the Rocky's I noticed my car did not climb very well. Other vehicles on the road seemed to be responding about the same. I decided to experiment and flipped the stick to Manual and dropped it into third gear. I was easily able to drive uphill at 90mph and still had power left over.</TEXT>

It got stuck twice in my apartment complex and took more than one hour and lots of effort park it. This car is fun to drive, very sporty and handles tight but is meant for dry weathers only. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, excellent choice and I'm very happy. I decided between this and the 2008 Toyota Corolla...my last car was a 1996 Toyota Corolla, which did the job, and got great mileage; was ready to move on though, and the Mazda3 had always caught my eye. Fun to drive, handles great, easy on the eyes; My 3 is blue with a beige interior. If you want a car to get you from point A to B that will never fail, with great mileage, get a corolla. The Mazda3 mileage isn't great (26 comb). I was getting 32 combined in my corolla. But...if you want a more all around package, go with the 3; no problems with it at all, and have gotten a lot of compliments on it; definitely feels a lot more expensive it is.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A month ago my cherished 323Ci had a meltdown. Living in L.A., I loved taking it through the mountain twisties on the weekend. With this economy, I decided to be prudent with replacement car. My ratings are based on expectations of the class, and not comparisons to my previous luxury car. I'm quite pleased with the handling of this compact. Though somewhat under-tired, it can stand up to a road like decker canyon blvd (23). The clutch is light in feel, but gives you a good sense of it's action through your foot, gearbox is excellent. Had the opportunity to test the brakes in a panic stop in my first week of driving, and they're probably in the top 10 of any car under $100k.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Aside from the fun of good grip, a manual transmission, and a free-reving engine, I really enjoy the heated seats: it's like having a back massager. I'm a big fan of the xenon headlights for safety, as well as the stability control. Interior is tasteful, and ergonomically efficient.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove other Mazda 3 competitors models (Rabbit, Civic, Cobalt, Focus). None matched the comfort, performance, style or price value of the 3. The cars looks great, has many added features and its not as common as a Civic or Focus. The Mazda provides the best all around package of reliability, easy to find parts, reasonable price, performance and sense of exclusivity. You still don't see that many around. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The cars has a very distinctive and powerful look to them. Its a design that has aged well. It handles and looks like a pricier car and the interior is very comfortable and stylish.

<TEXT>All in one top car for its class. Power when you need it, MPG's are adequate enough, Stops on a dime, Frontal chassis & great suspension provide a great ride. Interior features only lack cruise control, gps and a driver's seat with height position ajustment but the telescopic steering wheel make up for it. The center arm rest and compartment console position you perfectly and even when the seat quality is less then the top model it extends on it's side to hold you in place. The sound system rocks, I especially like the dash design and everything to go with it, fit and finish is perfect. Passenger space is adequate for a car its size and I vehemently disagree with others the truck is big.</TEXT>

This is by far the worst front wheel drive car I have ever owned or driven in any type of slippery condition. The anti lock brakes are always on and off at every stop and go situation as wheels spin out of control. I love this car in good dry weather, but this is not a car for upstate NY. I spent $900 for snow tires, didn't make any change in performance or handling. This car will not make it to next winter of 09.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I spent forever researching cars to buy and I test drove a few (the VW Rabbit, the Civic and the Toyota Matrix) before I was definite on the 3. The test drives clinched it. My mechanic of 15 years was also enthusiastic about the Mazda and now I know why. I am in love with my car. It is so sporty (looks and performance) and I couldn't be happier. I have the 5 speed and the shifting is so smooth, I would swear it was a pricier model/brand. I love to drive but I was looking for fuel economy too and I definitely picked a winner. The acceleration is excellent, but so is the fuel economy. 25-27 in the city, in heavy traffic, and 32-35 on the highway. Nice! You won't be disappointed at all. I'm thinking of buying another for my husband. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The best aspect is the style. I see my car and I almost can't believe how inexpensive it was. It appears and handles like a much more expensive car.

<TEXT>Outstanding suspension for hard roads,it feels sturdy and well balanced at high speeds. Fast off the blocks, stops on a dime. Combined 25 MPG = pwr & economy. Interior build is a superb finish, includes many options. Passenger glove compartment is easily 18 inches deep. Center arm rest sits above a 2 deck compartment with an MP3 and an extra electric outlet. This same center compartment continues toward the center where a door opens for 2 cup holder's. Telescopic steering wheel aids for precise seating comfort. Sporty European exterior accented with front/rear stylish lights which standout for looks. Mirror like paint job is perfect. Trunk space is big and not overbearing to the cars look. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Feels like a V6 at take off and handles like a sport car. Suspension is exact and it feels great. Fun to drive car. MPG are high for the power it packs and a 14.5 tank gallon means longer periods between fillups. Best Bang for the Buck. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A very fun car to drive. Great handling and one of the peppiest in its class. My only inconvenience with this model is that the headrests block the rear view mirror's view and the side window design makes it challenging to see cars in either lane when changing lanes. Took a little bit of adjustment to turn my head more to the sides before changing lanes to catch the blind spot. Can't say enough good about his car. I've had Honda Civics and Toyota Corollas and the Protege before, and this car is by far the best for handing, acceleration, and just pure fun. The other did however have better fuel economy.</TEXT>

It gets average fuel economy for its class, but the power from the 2.0 liter 4 cylinder engine is much better than you would expect! This car can definitely take off, and the manumatic shifting on the 4 speed automatic transmission is a nice touch. Kudos to the people responsible for this design!

<TEXT>I just traded in my 2000 Eclipse GT V6 (loaded) for a brand new 2008 Mazda 3 Grand Touring (even more fully loaded). The dealership checked every box, including navigation, sunroof, and the Bose multi-changer cd. The fit and finish in this car is hard to beat in the class and price range. Everything about this car is high quality. So far, in my first 500 miles, I haven't found anything to dislike. I was worried about "trading down" from a sports car, but I think I've really come out on the winning end with performance, economy, and an upscale interior with all of the amenities one could want.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>So many! Okay, the heated leather seats are a blessing right now in the cold Missouri mornings. The rain- sensing wipers make me smile.

<TEXT>The car has been a joy to own since new. No problems to date, just basic transportation the Mazda way - fantastic. Proper layout in the interior; Shifter placement is superb, and the tunnel nestles next to your right leg in perfect position as a rest spot on long journeys. Pedals light and user friendly. Exterior design is that of 'form equivalent function', meaning there is enough emotion but all of it is usable. Of course the chassis is up to snuff, ready to drive your any and every mood.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's a 'put it in your back pocket' kind of car that grows not on you but with you. Super sound and reliable, I'm looking forward to actually keeping this car for quite a while.

<TEXT>The Mazda3 is hands down the best car to buy out of all the compacts if you're looking for value and maybe a little respect on the road. I test drove every car in this class trying to find a car that wouldn't bust my bank and was still fun to drive. Nothing compared to the Mazda 3 when it comes to the fun to drive factor and the amount of options for the price. If you like driving a manual transmission make sure you test drive this car. Nothing else compares when it comes to 5 speed manuals at this price. I've been nothing but impressed with my Mazda 3 so far. Mazda has done a great job of reinventing themselves. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance and styling. European styling inside and out make the car look like a lot more than a budget compact. The suspension is amazing and the engine is geared just right.

I inquired about Sirius radio and it's $715 to install and for parts that is insane. If they put the SAT button on my dash it should have already come installed and only needed activation. The paint chips ever so easily thankfully the touch up paint was only 8 bucks. I think it may be the alloys but when you hit a bump or pot whole the tire feels likes it about to fall off. I drove one with reg hubcaps and didnt feel that! I love everything else about the car and still dont regret trading my Cavalier...although sometimes I do miss her!</TEXT>

I paid $17k with a year-end $2000 rebate for the S model with an automatic. I would have preferred a stick but had to compromise with the Mrs and opt for the auto - I've been very pleased with it though and have zero regrets with this choice of transmission. The best word to described this car is "zippy". I always look forward to getting behind the wheel.

<TEXT>After a full year of driving, I am still very happy with my 3. I researched several cars before purchasing, including the Ford Focus and Civic, but I got the most car for the money with the 3. Build quality and creature features are superb. Performance and handling are excellent, fun to throw into turns, and though it does not have the umph at acceleration of the Speed3, it is still fun to drive after a year. I live in snowy New Hampshire and went last winter without snow tires, and was sorry that I did. That being said, I still got through several storms with no problem. As a testament to safety, I was rear- ended at a stop light the first month I owned the car(!!!), and was uninjured.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first new car since 1971 so I did lots of research and drove many cars before deciding on the Mazda 3. I needed the utility of 4 doors & a hatch, but wanted a car that was economical & fun. My driving is evenly mixed interstate & city, 5,000 miles since July. So far I'm very pleased with the car. It's fun to drive, quick, handles like it's on rails & never below 30 MPH. Mine is Copper Red, the interior is Beige & Black, very sharp. I have seen only a couple like mine in Indy. The 5-speed is precise & smooth. The traction control permits a squawk in 3 gears, with it off first gear will smoke the tires. Check out the competition, bang for the $$ Mazda wins;-) I would buy it again!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Tire noise is very loud! This is a 2008 that is eight months old with 24,000 miles on it. This is my work car and is driven quite a few miles a day. I was very happy with mine, until the miles started adding up. Besides the tire noise, there is a loud noise coming from the right front fender area. The Mazda mechanic at the shop said he couldn't here it because of the tire noise. They contacted the Mazda rep, and he came to the dealer in Ottawa IL., but they didn't even show him my car, and I was told Mazda would pay one third of the cost to replace the tires, if they were replaced at the dealer. Dealer wants to put a different brand of tire on it so it will solve the problem. </TEXT>

MPG are an awesome benefit, have averaged 36 mpg for the summer & 28 mpg for the winter. Took a road trip to the smokies this past summer, and the car handled awesomely in the S-turns thru the mountains. I am very happy to be driving/owning my Mazda3!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 15 years of Honda's I have moved on. I gave my husband the 2004 Honda Element which is still a great vehicle for driving around with kids and everything at Lowe's. But mom wanted a sporty fun car for the commute to work and pick the kids up in school. LOVE IT. Great gas mileage. Pulled ahead during the gas shortage in the Atlanta area. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When I bought my Mazda3 it was actually my first new car. It is very fun to drive and the steering is more precise than anything I have ever driven. The leather is very comfortable although the dark leather certainly keeps the car warm. Fortunately the AC is amazing. Fuel economy is good but not amazing, but the car is more fun than anything that that gets better gas mileage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have 2000 mi. so far. All city miles so far. Mileage has steadily climbed starting at 28.5 to 31 mpg. There seems to be a gearing gap from 1st to 2nd gear. Trunk is roomy and back seats work great for my 7 and 11 yr olds. I think there should be more interior colors available. I wish there was a 6th gear for the highway. Not sure why the a/c turns on when you turn the temperature control know back all the way to cool.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far I'm impressed. My 3 may be described as a Japanese VW based on certain similarities. Handling is great, interior quality is great, and engine is smooth with better than expected torque and a great sound. A driver's car at a low price. Beats Civic and Corolla for personality. Thus far got 34 MPG. 5-spd is fun to shift. Body metal feels thinner and structure is less strong than my superb Golf TDI (which I kept); cheaper build, cheaper paint, but the price is lower. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After weeks and weeks of research, I narrowed it down to a Toyota and a Mazda. I purchased my Mazda3 about 4 hours away from home and had so much fun driving it on the highway! It will really get up and go! I don't find the road noise to be a problem. I love the leather interior! And the adjustable headlights are AMAZING! I was amazed at how much I like the auto wipers and lights! This is a great car and I totally recommend it! I'm getting about 25 mpg in town.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having driven mini-vans for 20+ years, I wanted something more economical (MPG) but still had some room to haul things. I also wanted to stay with Japanese. The M3 wasn't on my radar screen until pretty late in the game. I'm embarrassed to say this but the heated seats sealed the deal for me. The price was VERY attractive, too. Now that I've had the car for a few months and have put 6,000 miles on it, I'm quite enamored with it. Great amenities. It's fun too drive -- too fun maybe. I often have a hard time going easy for the better MPG. I miss the space/convenience of a mini-van but life is all about tradeoffs. Bottom line: no regrets, at least so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got the top of the line, hatch back, leather, heated seat, cd, iPod link, manual shift, 2.3 liters, etc. Lots of fun to drive, great looking car, not the most economic small car though. In the city I average 22 mpg. Test drove other similar cars, like Civic etc, M3 is the most fun to drive. I love the hatch back. I have loaded things in the back of this car that I could not have done with any other 4 doors car, Hatch back are considered 5 doors! It should have a roof rack! That is a great let down for me on this car. I learned that it is not available from factory after I bought the car. Now I have a thule, but it is not the same as having a factory one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this Mazda3 based mainly on previous professional reviews for its reliability, agility and fuel mileage. Plus, I really liked the exterior styling. After driving some 6000 miles I've found that the ride is jittery, choppy and generally unrefined. It always feel like there is a wheel out of balance or tire out of round. Both motor mounts where replaced and a 4 wheel road force balance but there is still a lot of engine shake felt through the steering wheel and chassis. I wouldn't buy again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one snappy little car and I'm very pleased with it. I've had it about a week and traded a loaded 2002 Jetta turbo for it (hooray, no more premium gas!). The cars that got great mileage (e.g. the Honda Fit) didn't have the power I need for a local highway where certain onramps force you to merge from a standing stop, so the Mazda was a compromise between mileage and power. It handles and drives beautifully, is well-equipped and well-designed with excellent fit and finish. Cons: there's more road noise than I'm used to and the sporty ride is stiff/bouncy. Also, the automatic transmission shift gates take some getting used to. These are just nits--I highly recommend this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For the money, this car was a great purchase. I added a spoiler and tinted the windows, and I have a nice little sports car for less than 19k. It's attractive, fun, roomy, and very practical. I only wish the gas mileage would be a little higher, but I guess Mazda didn't want to compromise the horsepower. I'm surprised they didn't add a remote trunk opener to the keyless entry, a minor annoyance, but the other positives like 17" alloys, steering wheel radio controls, outside temp, moonroof, and fog lamps more than make up for anything it's lacking. Mazda did a VERY good job designing this car, and it's an unbeatable buy. I'd highly recommend this car to anyone!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted to move down to a smaller car to get better mileage, but I still wanted room, so I started looking at 5 dr wagons. I'm a big guy 6'3" and after checking out all of the competition (focus, matrix, versa, astra, etc) I found the Mazda 3 by far the most comfortable. It looks great, good price, and has been averaging 29 mpg at 75% commute, 25% interstate. While the instruments, controls and displays are well laid out, the back lit orange display leaves something to be desired. The radio display is hard to read in many lighting situations, and is almost impossible to see with sunglasses on. It would have been really nice to see an MPG readout. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Driver comfort for a large guy is great. I can ride 5 hrs straight with no problem. With the seat folded down its got almost as much room in the back as my old Escape. I'm getting great mileage on my daily commute averaging 28-29 mpg. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I replaced my Mazda 626 of 15 years with this new Mazda3. I really want to buy an electric car, so this car is to get me through the next few years. Other than being 20th century technology, it seems like a solid, nice car. I would have preferred to buy a hatchback but did not want to bump up to the wagon with its heavier weight and bigger engine. I've had a difficult time getting accustomed to the clutch -- it seems to engage much higher on the pedal than I'm used to. I've also noticed the air conditioner seems to place a lot of drag on the engine; this can make judging the gas/clutch mixture a little tricky sometimes. Overall, I'd recommend it for the price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car drives excellent on dry pavement. This car isn't a daily commuter if you have snow, the OEM RSA eagles slide all over in 2" of snow. Get snow tires. The car is well worth the money, but a lot of plastic and styrofoam in front end. Insurance is high on this car, but so is the Civic. The 2.0 engine is more frugal on gas than it's 2.3 liter. I rented the 2.3 liter HB but it wasn't worth the extra gas money. This car is a sports sedan with the low pro tires and sits higher than a mini and Civic, that's why I bought it. However next year it's history I'm going with a car that has real carpets, and a more rigid build for safety.There are not enough options on a 2.0 also.</TEXT>

I am 6'4" and have taken the car on several day trips with my wife and three teen age kids. We fit snugly into the cabin, but everyone seems to have enough room to be comfortable. When alone with the seat back there is ample room and the seats are extremely comfortable. The 3 is very fun to drive, the fit and finish is a good as any car out there.

I have always been a Honda and Toyota guy and we still have a Tundra and a CRV as our standard drivers. We needed something for gas mileage and went with this car and so far feel very impressed. First day, one hundred mile mixed driving we got a little over 31 mpg (standard tranny). It drips with quality in the interior. I think the only thing that I don't like the quality of the carpets, but overall I think its fantastic for the price. Hope it holds up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having driven it for over a month now, I must say there is absolutely no buyers remorse. Handles very well even if you do feel the body roll a bit more than say a mini but a lot less than the civic. Acceleration isn't great off the line but acceleration in the 40-70 MPH driving band is very adequate for passing. In short the gearing to HP gives you the acceleration where your likely to need it more often than not. Mileage varies based on how sporty I'm driving it. I've done 27 (70 MPH long freeway drive with a small bit of in town stop and go) but the car does give you the urge to well drive so more often I'm getting in the 22-24 range mixed driving. </TEXT>

This car is fully loaded and I couldn't ask for more. Car handles great, corners great, and has good acceleration (which you can improve with the automanual). The black leather seats are very firm yet very comfortable and the heated feature works very fast, ~30 seconds. This car has the best turning radius of any car I've ever driven. I could say a lot more but just know it is a great car and you really can't go wrong purchasing it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I switched from a very reliable and efficient S-10 after 15 years of daily use. Almost 2000 miles on the Mazda3 so time enough to review: really good interior comfort (I'm 6'2), great acceleration with the 2.3 L engine from a stop (though not quite as eager when merging onto the highway), and stylish, masculine exterior. I like that this is close to the end of the production cycle so the bugs are mostly (hopefully) worked out -- learned this lesson from the '93 S-10. This is really 2004's best car with fewer trouble spots and 2008 technology and safety equipment. Best of all, I have averaged a better than expected 32 mpg with roughly 70% highway driving and heavy A/C use.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>iPod connection, better than expected fuel economy for the 2.3 L, great looks, copper red mica color, and passenger side fuel door (really helps at the one-way-in one-way-out places where cars line up on the right side of the pump and leave the left side open)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Researched new 5-door for past 6 months. The Mazda3 beats every all others, hands down. The build quality is outstanding. The attention to detail and standard features in a "base model" are a lesson to other car builders. The Mazda3 automatic drives like a charm - be careful if you have other drivers in the house - it will quickly become a car of choice. The maintenance schedule is like no other - Sealed automatic transmission - no service required; 1st coolant flush - 100,000 miles; pretty much just oil changes. I recommend the Mazda extended warranty - very reasonably priced and gives you bumper to bumper coverage. </TEXT>

All had low tire pressure 3 months (cold day?) in all tires, but put air in them and no problem.

<TEXT>I don't know where you can get a better car for the money. The body style, fuel economy, and "fun to drive" factor is amazing. I downsized from an SUV and wanted something sporty but under $20K for mostly city use. After 2,500 miles I am getting 24 MPG in town and 30/31 MPG on the highway.

<TEXT>I bought the top-of-the-line sedan. It handles and rides very well. It's quiet inside without too much road noise. The automatic transmission is very smooth and includes a digital indicator of the current gear as it shifts, which is a useful feature. It has good acceleration with the 2.3L engine (but you won't mistake it for a V6 or V8.) The car was delivered in perfect condition, with no problems or blemishes of any kind. Both the interior and exterior have a "look" of quality. The car doesn't appear cheesy, like a lot of inexpensive cars do. On my 2nd tank of gas, the display showed 28.4 mpg average. It has a ton of equipment: Bose, Sirius, stability, xenon, advanced brakes, etc.</TEXT>

This is a great car, so jump on the 2.0 liter before they change it to compete w/Subaru! This engine is lighter than the 2.3 and in my opinion, more fun to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>High quality materials, looks very rich inside compared to more expensive Hondas. Eager engine, projector headlights, enormous standard feature list that you'd pay thousands more for on other cars. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has many refined features and amenities of much more expensive cars. I would much rather drive it than my mom's pristine Lexus. This car is nimble, versatile with the back hatch, fold downs, and comfortable. I get compliments all the time on it. It is Metropolitan Grey Mica; sun/moon roof, heated power seats, Bose stereo independent suspension and a computer for about anything you can thing of, this thing just ROCKS. It is plenty quick and comfy at 85+ on the expressway if that's your bag. I stayed away from the turbo charger because the dealer in my home town wasn't certified to work on them, so I didn't want to chance it. I get 30+ M mixed driving! The AT, with manual mode is fun.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking into getting rid of my chevy s-10 truck and getting a reliable sedan. Mazda is that car and more. I love the car and have owned it for 1 week. It drives like an expensive sports car and the feel on the road is excellent. You cant beat the price and the extras that the car comes with. If you need or are looking into a new car, test drive a Mazda and you will see what I mean. Love my Mazda 3. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I like driving this car, even though I generally dislike automatic transmissions. I bought this mainly for my daughter, but she's away at college 7 months out of the year, so I get to drive it often. It shifts smoothly and quietly. Has plenty of quickness and power, and doesn't feel too small, like the Honda Fit, Nissan Versa and Scion xD. Excellent steering/handling. Plus, the gas mileage is pretty decent. I drive 90% city, and average 26.2 mpg. Road noise is a little high, but not a big distraction. It has every comfort and convenience feature one could ask for, yet the price is ridiculously low. Heck, in a BMW, you could spend the price of this car in accessories alone!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The leather steering wheel and heated leather seats. The iPod aux. jack & power outlet in the center console. The decent stock stereo with steering wheel controls. The xenon auto headlights & auto wipers. The excellent gas mileage. The nice stock wheels & tires. It looks expensive!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in my extremely basic Chevy Cavalier for a Mazda3 and i Dont regret it one bit. The comfort is spectacular. The Cavalier seats were made of nothing and the Mazda has the adjustable seat height I love it. I love how it lights up red at night. I love the Copper Red Mica Color! Its not as fuel efficient as my cavalier but who cares. I have a/c now and for the texas summers thats a major plus. Minimal road noise. Even though it looks tiny it's pretty big on the inside. The glove box is large and the trunk is very deceiving although it's short once you pop the trunk it goes back pretty far. I would highly suggest this car to anybody.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power windows and locks. The controls on the steering wheel and the sportmatic, even though I dont know how to use the manual side. The adjustable seat height.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in my 2003 Mustang GT convertible for this vehicle and I must say I love this car. Even with going from 8 cyl down to 4, I still get plenty of power and pickup from this car, especially from a stop. Ride is great, very quiet and tight. Bose stereo system is very nice as well. This is a great car for someone looking to get a small car, but still wants to spend a little money for comforts and options (auto lights and wipers are cool!). The only "complaint" is the somewhat low MPG for such a small vehicle. I have been averaging 26-28 MPG combined according to the onboard computer (if I calculate it the old fashioned way, I estimate 28-30 MPG). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stereo, performance, auto wipers/headlights.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my 3i Touring Value last Saturday. I have gotten nothing but compliments on the car. It has great acceleration, nice looks, has a moonroof and a 6-cd changer. The 5 spd has a good gear ratio and the engine rides smoothly, particularly above 55 mph. Handling is superb and on par with German sedans costing nearly twice as much. I was originally going for the 5dr, but did not want to sacrifice fuel economy. Car is still new, so can't judge everything just yet but it is near perfect and I have no regrets.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The iPod jack, moonroof, leather wrapped wheel and gear shift, wheel-mounted audio controls, foglights, lumbar supportive seats, telescoping wheel, visibility, alloys.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ever since I first saw the Mazda 3, I knew I wanted one. As soon as I saw the interior and took it for a test drive, I knew I wanted it. I was a little worried about the way the car sounded on the road, but I'm used to it now. For all of the features, I think this car is at the perfect price. My friends and family love riding in my car, and it is definitely more fuel efficient than my old accord!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good factory sound system, dash lights, big trunk, stereo/cruise controls on steering wheel, exterior has an excellent look.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my beloved 04 Toyota 4Runner SR (V8 4WD) for the Mazda 3 and really though I would miss it. It's only been a short-time but so far the 3 has been so much fun to drive that I haven't missed the big SUV. With 31 Cu Ft of cargo space (seats folded down) I should be able to transport my kids back and forth to college with ease. So far I have been saving ($4.20 per gallon) $36 per week on fuel.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything... sunroof, stereo controls on steering wheel, storage compartments and cargo space. My three teenagers can sit in the back seat and are not crammed in.</FAVORITE>
