<TEXT>I purchased two new GM vehicles in 2008, a Cadillac STS AWD and a Silverado 1500 LTZ 4WD. The quality of workmanship was the best I've ever seen in my 53 years of owning and driving all kinds of cars. 0 defects, good fitment, quality throughout. As good over better than any foreign car or truck I've ever been exposed to. Thinks I, "They've finally got it right". </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>"Feel", Quality of Manufacture, No defects. Ride, handling. This is one of the best automobiles manufactured. For it's price, none are better. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love it, except the paint. The car is black, and I had it waxed immediately, by a professional. The first time I cleaned it myself, I discovered many pock marks on the hood and rear deck. They are in the paint, and wax does not remove them. I am taking it into the dealer to check. The paint is defective, and I hope someone will back it up.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation, radio.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased mine at the end of August when there were only V6 AWD models. I traded my V8 STS and thought I would be taking a step down. With V6 DI engine, I really do not miss the V8. So far this car is solid in all respects; handles well,comfortable, reliable, good mileage and is fast enough. In my opinion, this car favorably competes with BMW, MB and the other usual suspects but after you negotiate your final price, there really is no comparison becuse you pay a lot less. The status of a label is unimportant to me (although a Caddy still has some clout left) and as car enthusiast, I look to the raw driving experience. STS is right there and if the V8 G8 had AWD, I would be driving that.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration vs mileage ( I get 30mpg at steady 70 mph), supportive seats, driving dynamics</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first Caddy. I have owned many Lincolns, several Mercedes, a terrific Jag and some unmentionables over my almost 40 years of "business" driving. This car has great styling, exceptional sound system and many, many options. It is very responsive, quite and comfortable to drive. I drove all the "others" before I chose the caddy and price was not a concern. I'm glad to be driving an American sport sedan. It looks good and drive great. Time will tell but so far it's a winner.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bose sound system, Nav, OnStar, Bluetooth</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car is fun to drive and is great when its not in the repair shop. I have had my STS in service 2 times in the last three months (BRAND NEW) for different problems. GM and Cadillac treat you like you bought a Chevy.You pay a high end price and get low end service. To sum it up, they suck and I will never buy a GM product again. High end imports are more reliable and give much better customer service.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 2 BMW,I just bought my first caddy at 36 yrs old.I was just tired seeing BMW,G35,NEW C-class even the new CTS every corner. So I found a great STS. It's very comfy very luxurious and the space inside. The nav with the 15 speakers from Bose? Oh la la. Its the best oem sound system I've ever heard, by the way I am a musician. Of course the mileage is so so I bought the v8. Funny that the hid light are not std for that car. Overall its a good value when reduce cause I wouldn't buy at full retail. I love everything about the car but its not BMW handling and driving experience. When you think about it who care were not formula 1 driver, right? Cadillac: the ultimate luxury experience? I guess</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Key fobs, nav, sound system, seats, exclusivity, heated front- rear seats and steering wheels and the look of it. Thunder Gray Chromaflair paint.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the V8 style, because adaptive speed control was not available on the V6. I traded in my 2005 STS, and got a great deal on the purchase. To this point, I am very pleased with the car, although gas mileage has not been good. Hopefully, it will get batter as I put more miles on the car. Although my 2008 is still very new,I believe it is a big improvement over the 2005. The car looks and rides better. I believe I made a good decision in purchasing the 2008 STS.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good looks,inside and out, lots of great features (i.e., adaptive speed control, heads up display, OnStar, Lane and blind spot warnings, XM radio, etc.) make driving easier, and performance to date has been very good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Since January my wife and I have driven this vehicle daily. At 250 miles we took off to Florida from Ohio and averaged 24 mpg at 68 mph. Many times I took it above 75. The six speed transmission feels almost continuously variable. We purchased the navigation option along with the luxury interior package and AWD. I agree 18" wheels would have been nice but the HD brakes are not compatible with this larger wheel. The car performance is smooth and controllable compared to the BMW 535 and the Mercedes E Series. We test drove the CTS and agree with other reviewer that there is no comparison . Quality is unassailable and with 5500 miles ytd we would purchase all over again. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD for Ohio winters and On-Star turn by turn navigation. Size of the vehicle is perfect. Fuel efficiency is unbelievable for a car of this weight and physical size. Seat heaters and automatic temperature control are fantastic. We like the three levels of control on the seat heaters.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Cadillac, & I love it! Everywhere I go, people tell me it is a beautiful car. I love the red of this car, & I love all of the chrome. We took it on a 2500 mile trip two months after buying it, & had a wonderful drive. We did have a problem when pulling over on the highway to change drivers. A rain- filled pot-hole crumpled the front end, not noticeable on the outside. A simple call to OnStar led us to the nearest dealer. The only option we did not get was the navigation system, & I'm fine with that! My husband had wanted a Chrysler 300, & I sold him on this, & so far, he's happy with the car, & me! I love that smiling front end! (On the car!)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The beautiful looks of the 2008, especially, in red w/black interior. The seats, esp. the air conditioned front ones, were one of my main selling points. Also love the power & gas mileage of our V6.Also love the OnStar, who needs a nav system? I am just basically in love with this car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Car has been into shop twice with less than 400 miles on the odometer. Today it completely died after refusing to shift into any gear higher than second. Problems with stability control and antilock brake system at 200 miles. Also has some paint flaws that need to be addressed. I'm sorry I tried so hard to buy this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove a CTS first. It was just Ok. I then drove the STS and Wow. I was sold! Big difference. They want to sell you a CTS at sticker b/c they make more $ on them, but the STS is worth the extra money, it is much more car. Smooth, quiet, luxurious. This is quite simply a nicer car than the 5- series BMW and E-Class Mercedes without the price tag of the BMW or the poor quality of the Mercedes. I could not tell the difference in performance test driving the V-8 and V-6. The DI V6 feels like a V-8. This car simply babies you. Frustrating that you can't get AWD with all the toys in the V-6. I opted for all the toys on a RWD with the 18" chrome wheels package - Car looks awesome.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system, Bluetooth, 18" chrome wheels, Heads Up Display!! Lane drift awareness, blind spot awareness both work great! Love the heated/air conditioned memory seats and - best of all - the keyless push-button start. I LOVE this car! Driving a BMW or Mercedes? Bet you didn't test drive an STS.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love the car. But difficult to get out of it. Doors seem a bit small. GPS advanced, difficult to learn. Dealer should specifically have someone to spend 30 to 45 minutes with you to review. Would make life easier first few days. Overall very happy and doing better on gas after 350 miles than I expected</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>looks and performs well</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First off, I am in full agreement with all preceding reviews. And I wonder why I haven't seen (in last eight months) any media promotion, a commercial or even a simple ad for this sophisticated competitor to the Lexus, Infiniti, BMW, and Benz types. Incidentally, there isn't even any dedicated 2008 STS Forum on Edmunds yet! The only three minuses on the car are the lack of space inside "for stuff" (where to put glasses?), small trunk and overcomplicated nav system, which is, in fact, inferior for instance to the 5-year older 2003 CTS system.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had driven a Volvo S-60 with AWD and wanted a bigger AWD car. Looked at BMW, Audi, Lexsus and settled on the STS with the new direct injected V-6. Great power, great tranny. Car has every bell and whistle. Love the remote start, heated-cooled seats and the heated steering wheel. Car is good looking outside and very attractive inside. Great highway cruiser but also very agile and responsive in city driving. In snow or rain the AWD is superb!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Bose 5.1 stereo, by far the best I've ever heard. Great tunes all the time!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was really excited about getting this car. I wanted the Bluetooth capability and ordered the vehicle when I discovered it was included. However, the voice recognition system is quite faulty as it just does not work properly. Cadillac just installed a second nav radio to combat this problem and still it does not respond to voice commands. When a command is given, it responds three times with "Pardon" and then says "Command not recognized." Because of this, I am not able to make telephone calls except when the vehicle is in park. Not at all convenient. Maybe Cadillac will fix this problem. I hope so.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling. This car is a pleasure to drive. Sound is great and I love the gizmos. Like the auto high beam feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have only owned the Caddy for a couple of weeks, and I am very impressed. I looked at evrything from BMW's, Acrua's other Cadillac's, and even the new Buick Enclave. I live in snow country of upper Michigan, and the STS afforded me the opportunity to own a classy, Luxury car with AWD. Gas mileage is great compared to owning an SUV upper here. And the in-line V6 has all the get up an go that I would need. At first the Navigation system appears to offer it self to one with a degree in computers, but a little hands on time is all thats needed. Cost more than the CTS, but you get more and it is defintely a better auto for the extra money!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Bose 5.1 stereo, navigation system, and the Leather seats. The dash set-up of the instrument panel works great for me. The in-line V6,. No need for the V8. Enough get up and go when floored to pass.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We enjoy driving this car and both want to drive when we go. Handles fantastic and could not be quieter. The direct injected six is more powerful than my old Seville V8, has more horsepower. The mileage is better than the 2001 Seville as well. Interior finish is tops, the programing features took some time to master for the memory feature. Very happy with this car and no bag of money had to go to Japan!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quietness of the engine and ride. Stability of car while driving. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just traded in my 2003 v-8 FWD SLS for a new 2008 v-6 STS RWD. Having driven the '03 for 4 years and the '08 for only a few weeks short weeks, I can say that the '08 is by far a better car. That is not to say anything bad about the '03, just that Cadillac got it right with this one. RWD, IMHO, is a much better way to design and build this class of car. I got the car pretty much loaded up. Sticker was ~$54K. The larger 18" wheels included in the 1SC Luxury Performance package, along with the HD brakes really make this a driving machine. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the gizmos! My wife is less attracted to all the Techno updates, but give me all the technology you can. If it weren't for the awkward looking "pod" mounted in the windshield, I would have also opted for the laser guided cruise control and the lane guidance systems.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I like this car. However, the manual reads like it was written in a language other than English. Instead of providing information, the manual refers you to two other pages to get the information. The navigation system is nice, but difficult to learn and again the manual is little to no help. The seats are comfortable and I like the sporty ride. The glove compartment is way too small. I do not like the fact that when opening the trunk, it does not open fully. As a photographer I have arms full of equipment. I would have liked the trunk to open so I could put the equipment in the trunk instead of on the ground so I can manually open the trunk. Not a convenient feature.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2008 STS Just delivered and drove from East Hampton Long Island to Myrtle Beach South Carolina. Wife and kids love the ride on this car, more than our former BMW 5 series. MPG combined on the car's computer stunned us with 21.6 combined, and 27 mpg all day long on the highway, running 87 octane!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats, Bluetooth touchscreen, XM radio for the family, with AUX IPOD jacks directly into the radio via the under arm rest inputs. GM/Cadillac have knocked it out of the park for $44,600 out the door, loaded.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>302-horsepower engine with direct injection V6. A bolder look on the outside and inside will attract younger buyers. I am 41. I wanted a 4 wheel drive car that can accommodate 3 car seats in the back. I looked at the BMW 535xi, Lexus GS350 AWD Infiniti M35 (currently drive Infiniti M45) at Audi A6. For the money the 2008 I stress the 2008 STS was the best value. The increased performance and the side air extractors, incorporated into the front fenders of STS. New chrome-plated door handles and lower rocker moldings are added for more presence and refinement. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great American car. Keyless start (push button) Can start the car and air from 200 feet away Bluetooth interface </FAVORITE>
