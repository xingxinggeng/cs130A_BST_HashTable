<TEXT>Great car, sound system is great, great acceleration. I'm glad the Premium package I for 2009 has bluetooth since I live in CA. Great improvement.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cupholders are better than in the BMW 328I, full seat pockets not netting, substantial seatbelt arms, memory seats for passenger, smooth ride, great leather quality, great styling, more passenger AC options.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First convertible and I love it! Really wanted a metal top, but wound up trading our 2005 E320 4-matic for the rag top at the dealership. Liked the SLK (metal top) but felt it was too selfish with only 2 seats, but have never used the back seats!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Just a fun to drive car and I have the top down as often as possible. Left it in Florida for the winter months up North, got 28 MPG on the trip back.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just a great car! Performance is amazing, handling is excellent without sacrificing too much ride quality, and the brakes are phenomenal. I bought the car 4 months ago and am averaging 18mpg, pretty good for 5.5l V8. Bizarrely this is better mileage than I got from my 2005 C320. My only complaint is that sometimes the transmission gets confused, especially if flooring the throttle at around 20-25mph. There is a noticeable lag before things start happening. Also watch it in the rain, it will spin the rear tyres at 70mph under full acceleration. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Having owned several performance Mercedes over the yrs including the SL series, the CLK 550 is proving to be the best road machine I have ever driven. Mechanics wedded to aesthetics.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car. I moved up from an Acura CL-S, so it was an upgrade on all fronts. The acceleration is silky smooth. For the most part, the engine is quiet but still can let out that great sounding growl when you really jam the pedal. There's no cooler sound than rolling through a short tunnel and hitting the gas just before the mouth It's like a sonic boom! Mine is fully loaded, with the P3 package and just about every option available. I think the P2 package is enough though, and you don't need silly options like the automatic trunk opener/closer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I would highly recommend getting the 550 over the 350. This stout engine is really worth it. Whether it's from a dead stop or already going 60 on the highway, you always have a ton of power in your back pocket whenever you need it. With its top down, the CLK has few rivals in terms of looks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2007 SLK that I had purchased new in March of 2007. It was a nice car, but tight on space and not very comfortable. The CLK Cabriolet is fantastic. The seats are the most comfortable I have set in ... even better than our 2008 Lexus LS 460. The Harmon Kardon stereo is incredible. The ride is crisp yet smooth and it literally glides over the roads. Some of the speakers vibrated at first with any significant bass, but this seems to have subsided quite a bit. The Irridium Silver paint is beautiful in lower light or artificial light, but in sunlight, you see the problems with the metallic paint...looks like it was painted with a spray can. Moral, don't buy on a cloudy day.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>interior comfort and high quality leather, great stereo, fantastic handling, a bargain for the performance and comfort, top is smooth and opens and closes quickly, very little windnoise (compared to the 2008 Lexus in the next garage bay that has a lot for a $73K car...Germans are still the best!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had owned numerous BMWs and bought a new 2008 Lexus LS460 recently. I traded in a 2007 Mercedes SLK on this 2008 CLK to have more room and comfort. This car is so far ahead of the competition that its not even funny. The seats are amazingly comfortable. The top operation is flawless. The interior design and comfort exceptional. The Irridium Silver paint seems a bit splotchy in bright light. The ride quality is excellent. The handling is tight, much better than that of the SLK. I am very impressed with this car! A+++</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Transmission, comfort, incredible H/K stereo, fantastic seats, supple leather, tight handling!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This limited production car is truly a unique experience. The acceleration is impressive, but the handling is the vehicle's true standout. The individually adjustable coil-over suspension allows one to not only adjust the ride height, but also the compression and the rebound of the shocks to tailor the handling to your individual taste. The AMG Performance Studio really outdid themselves when the produced this wonderful example of their capabilities.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This car sounds like no other Mercedes. I love the way the engine sounds when the start button is depressed. Pure fun!</FAVORITE>
