<TEXT>I have owned over 20 new cars so far and the 2008 CTS is Number 1 on my list of cars that I've owned! Its great distinctive styling and great looks, fabulous interior, great reliability and super handling makes it fun to drive and a real joy to own! Cadillac and GM have really done a great job on this car! The attention to detail and build quality is the best I've experienced! The interior in the CTS is truly a work of art! If you haven't considered or test driven the new CTS, you are not being fair to yourself and your missing one of the best car choices out there! The CTS is a super overall package especially with its great all wheel drive option! Give it a try and see for yourself!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Distinctive styling, great interior, double size sun roof, a super all wheel drive set up, smooth direct injection engine that runs on regular, super transmission, great handling and braking, a real joy to own and drive! All of this, at a very competitive price, makes the new CTS a fantastic value!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After looking at several cars (BMW 330xi, Mercedes Benz C230 & Audi A4) we decided to go with a CTS4 as I've been a Caddy fan for years. The 3.6L DI is exceptional, fun to drive and the overall build quality is something I'm not used to from GM. There are several flaws in the vehicle that I'm experiencing (minor) such as the express close moonroof doesn't actually close on it's own and the steering has a light clicking when turning. One major disappointment for me comes not from the car, but from GM. Our nearest Cadillac dealership is 2.5 hrs away; somewhat a nuisance when repairs are necessary, especially when we have about 4 GM dealers in the area. </TEXT>

<TEXT>In less than 24 months of ownership car has spent over 6 weeks in the shop being repaired or awaiting parts for a repair. 2008 CTS has had issues with timing chains. Cadillac had to redisgn the part because of high failure rates according to the Cadillac representatives I have spoken too. In addition, I have had persistent keyfob issues, accelerator sensor failures, nicked wiring harness, etc. Cadillac has been less than sympathetic about the LEMON they sold me. The car has been in the shop so often, it probably knows the route by heart. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a fully loaded 08, the back deck where the speakers are rattles terribly, along with bad back struts that rattle louder than the deck. people that ride with me think I have a bunch of empty paint cans in the trunk rolling around! Everything squeaks from the sunroof to the chairs. Plus the service hours are terrible at the dealer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has been incredible since owning it; gets more looks and comments than any car I've ever owned. Sure, the mileage isn't great, but I didn't buy this to save a few $ on fuel. Interior is SO quiet, build quality is fantastic, and it's a pleasure to drive. In fact, my wife and I fight over who gets to drive it when we go out! We chose the black on black, which really sets the car off. Absolutely stunning to look at. With regards to comfort, I'm 6'5" and have no worries in the drivers seat. Would suggest winter tires for the snow as it is rear drive, but otherwise not a problem. Would buy another one in a heartbeat. LOVE IT!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my '08 CTS in August of 2008 as a demo car, so it already had about 5k miles on it. Have had no major problems or defects. The DI engine is awesome, especially when you use premium gas. There are a few rattles that come from the dash and the driver's seat does do some squeaking, especially when the leather is cold. My only complaint has been the brakes, which started squeaking about a month after I bought it. Dealer tells me it's because of the parts used and GM should have a replacement out by January '09 - but it's May and still no way to stop the squeaking. Brakes work fine though. Overall, very happy with my purchase - it's a beautiful car, fun to drive, and a really good price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car just over a year ago. Love the 40 gig hard drive, and nav system with the traffic reports. The car is very comfortable to drive, and handling and acceleration are better than average. The CTS is a sharp looking car inside and out, and the build quality is better than my last two cars, a Mercedes and a Jag. One of the best cars I've owned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a fully loaded 2008 CTS w/ DI brand new and ended up trading it in about 5k miles later. So you can see where this is going. Overall the car was great, fun the drive, and looked very nice. But after 6 dealer visits and a few annoying issues unresolved, it had to go. The big issue with this CTS and ALL of the CTS's I tested was poor build quality and materials. Every piece of plastic squeaks in the car from the center stack, to center console, to the cheap "chrome" bezel on the IP. Like rattles? Plenty of those around the sunroof, doors, etc. This is not what I or anybody expects from GM's 'best' car they are offering for sale right now. If GM can fix that, they might survive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the car when it's not in the warranty service shop. Have 24,000 miles on it, and it has had two major repairs. First, at 12k miles, the cheap plastic clips that hold up the wiring harness broke in cold weather and the fan destroyed the harness. Then after the check engine light came on at 24k, and the inferior timing chain had to be replaced. Now, I;m told the service codes indicate the cam/crank misalignment. Pretty sad for GM's "flagship" car line. Then there's been constant leaks in the door seals (repaired three times), which whistle above 40 MPH. The premium Bose sound is a disappointment This is my 1st & last Cadillac.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Haven't owned an American car in years, but after reading reviews, decided to give it a try. My previous car was an '06 Audi A6. Very impressed with this new Cadillac...the CTS has an amazing ride-handling combination, great power with the DI engine, and awesome looks. The perceived quality is on par (if not better) with the top German and Japanese offerings. Time will tell about long term reliability.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Suspension, steering, ride, handling, interior quality and ambiance are all world-class. Exterior has great "presence" on the road. Excellent navigation and superb sound system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my '08 CTS for about a month now, and the commercials are spot on - this car turns me on every time I fire it up. It's a real head turner, and I've gotten more looks and thumbs ups than with any other car. Mine has the 6 speed w/ DI engine, and most every option available. I say most options because one that I really wanted - AWD, was not available with the stick. I test drove the G35X, BMW 335iX, Audi A4 Quattro and finally the CTS and it was love at first sight. The CTS is really that good, and a bit bigger than the others. I really wanted AWD and I might have a different opinion after the snow falls, but I'm planning in investing in a decent set of snow tires. We'll see..</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The aroma of the leather in this Cadillac is intoxicating. I find myself sitting in the car just to breathe it in, and to listen to the incredible Bose surround system. This is by far the best factory system that I have ever heard. Listen and smell for yourself, you won't be disappointed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Once was a true blue American car buyer. During a period with no contract, I sold Toyotas and bought into the foreign car hype. However, something about the engines never gave me the feel of muscle in the engines of an American. This car has the get up and go I grew up with, yet the luxury I've grown to expect. I have the 304 DI with the Performance package which combined really gives a superior driving experience. And oh, BTW Sunset Blue has chameleon characteristics that may make you not recognize your car depending on the time of day and/or the light it's in. I love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Waited 7 weeks and 1 day for cars arrival after factory order. Even though I had seen hundreds of photos in magazines and television ads, I was stunned by the car's beauty and design in person. And this is from a guy that owns an 07 MB S550 and 06 MB CLS500. The White Diamond paint is outstanding as is the build quality. The interior is excellent as well. I can't imagine anyone not being pleased with this vehicle. I got on the freeway and opened it up a bit and was very happy with the response and smoothness of the egine and transmission. Kudos to General Motors.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Outstanding design and workmanship. Firm and sporty ride but not harsh over bumps. I was pleasantly pleased with the ease of access to the rear seat and the leg room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Already owned 2 Cadillacs and had no intentions of replacing my 2004 CTS with another Cadillac. However, my dealer called me when the 2008 came in and insisted I drive it. Needless to say I feel in love and I couldn't pass up the deal. GM finally blew me away with this car and kept me as a customer. Purchased a fully loaded Crystal Red with the 3.6 Direct Inject engine. This is truly an amazing car and far succeeds the previous models and certainly is a competitor to BMW, Lexus, Mercedes, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this loaded 2008 CTS to replace our base model 2004 CTS. What a huge step up! Ours is exactly like the Crystal Red CTS4 seen in all of the ads. This car draws a great deal of attention when we are out in it. An 800 mile road trip in the first week of ownership proved to be a most pleasurable drive. The car handles like a sports cars and the 304 HP V6 sure feels like a V8. The ride is Cadillac quality but with a nice sporty road feedback. All of the chatter about the sunroof letting in too much light proved to be a non- issue. Even with the light Cashmere interior the sun shade blocked out the sun's rays just fine. This is a truely great car to own! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation and 10 speaker Bose sound system are great. We love the heated and cooled seats along with the remote starting. Also the HID lights are superb! Our biggest issue with the 04 CTS was poor handling in snow but now with AWD the CTS is the perfect luxury/sports car to own! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Be prepared to be impressed - from putting on some of Cadillac's color options - to the extensive standard equipment, all are better on this car. If the same level of attention paid in planning then building this car can be transfered to others in the GM Family - watch out world for market share will return back to the USA! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>By far the suspension combined with the engine - providing the most positive and exciting driving experience. Other than for the prestige need for more HP - this car competes and wins against much more expensive choices.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Came off a lease of an Audi A4. The CTS was a new design for 08, which was appealing. Seriously considered the BMW 335xi also. Having more rear leg room and supporting an American company were the deciding factors. However, build quality of my A4 was much better than the CTS. Have already had the CTS in for steering (wheel shakes) and navigation problems. Spending 4 hours at the dealership with a two week-old $48,000 vehicle is quite discouraging. Steering feels "disconnected" from car at times, especially during aggressive driving. Fuel-injectors make a noticeable, annoying hum. Thanks go to a great stereo to mask this. Upon close inspection, my black paint has factory flaws.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The CTS is a sharp looking car. Considering the 304 horsepower, it gets good gas mileage. Plus, no need for premium. It's great to get a lot more horsepower than my A4, and still get equivalent mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Leased an '03 and then an '05. The new '08 improves on every aspect of the CTS both the good and the not so good. Huge improvements in the interior. Ride, suspension, handling all even better than before, and the handling was already great. I'm delighted to see GM's initial success in design mature so well. Growing up, I loved Caddies so it's satisfying to be driving one as a grown up. (Brings out the teen in me when I'm behind the wheel.) My CTS is, without any exceptions or explanations, every bit as good or better than what Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Lexus and Infiniti can turn out for the money. That's improtant to me, since it would be great to keep driving cars like this made by GM.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior still says CTS, but pushes the design forward. Sleek and sexy. Seats much improved. Radio and Bose sound are superb. Love the LED light tubes in the front and rear lamp housings. Double sunroof is slick. My favorite feature is how it drives on SW PA's twisty country roads. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned quite a few cars over the past 20 years all in the luxury market. I do alot of driving a year with pharm. sales. I would say in my experience this is one of the best cars I've driven for the money. Great performance and handling, easy to use features, feels luxury unlike in my opinon the previous CTS. An awesome ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The tivo radio is a must.Ii love it! Air conditioned seats are on par with BMW. The huge glass moonroof is a huge hit with passengers as well as the ambient lighting system and pop up dvd nav. Awesome wow factor and gives you instant conversation with clients or dates. Keyless system is a must!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm a loyal Toyota customer who is grateful for heeding the advice to test drive the all new 2008 Cadillac CTS after nearly committing to purchasing a 2008 Toyota Avalon XLS. The 2008 CTS is far superior in quality, performance, and handling. That's right, the 2008 Cadillac CTS walked all over the Avalon for quality Three out of four Avalons I considered had very noticeable interior fit-and-trim problems. While the Avalon was very capable and pleasant to drive, there wasn't anything outstanding about the vehicle. On the other hand, the CTS provided me with an instant "WOW" experience in the road. This vehicle is fun to drive and the handling and suspension is outstanding.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Driving a Caddy (or any GM) never even entered our minds. We'd driven Infiniti, Lexus, and had left. Really liked what we'd driven so far. Stopped in to get the payoff on our Hummer trade-in. A black CTS in the showroom had (afater market) 20" chrome wheels and a feature set at least $6 - $10K better than Lexus and BMW. Just to be thorough, we drove it. Amazing ride. Stunning. I'm still smiling. Everything everybody is saying. I just kept thinking, "This is a Caddy?" I couldn't beleive it. Only several days later, but I'm still giddy. I love this car. Fast, smooth, quiet, responsive, corners on rails. There isn't enough room in this review space. Trust me: drive this car! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>NAV, XM Traffic, hard drive, double sunroof, spaciousness, on-dash leather, ambient lighting (love this), the cooled seats. I can't beleive how much I love this car. This is a Caddy?

<TEXT>This car rocks! It's the red one on TV and magazine covers; I got it fully featured, but opted for the Auto vs Manual shift. It replaced my '03 CTS that I loved (and so did my BMW-owning friends....more room!) I obliged my Mercedes and Audi loving relatives by considering them, but hands down this CTS packs more punch/value for every buck. I find it a smooother ride than the Europeans. It has more useful features than my cousin's limited edition Audi that cost $80K. He said he has no iPod connector nor USB port, nor 36 preset channels, nor as much room in the back seat for clients as I do. The teenagers in my neighborhood went crazy over it. Talk about not being Dad's car anymore!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's smokin' beautiful! Great sound system, superb handling, 40GB hard drive, smooth ride, so quiet, luxurious ambient lighting, and remote start to cool my seats & forget this is Florida.

<TEXT>My new CTS is awesome! I've had it for just about a month and now have 2K miles on it. It's a thrilling ride and looks gorgeous. When I bought my CTS I researched and test drove all the major competitors (BMW 3 Series, Mercedes C Class, etc.) and the CTS beat them all in drive, HP, leg room (I'm 6' 2" and have enough room to even sit in the back) and in looks. This is my first Caddy but won't be my last.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was considering the 3-series, 5- series, and Acura TL in addition to this vehicle. I'd have been happy with any of them I think, but the CTS had that extra bit. The technology was abundant and easy to use. The performance was amazing on twisty lake side roads. I've driven it about a 1000 miles so far on business trips and my customers gush over it and I sit in comfort the whole while. Get the air conditioned seats! I also appreciated the DFI engine over the standard and am getting about 28 mpg on the freeway. 20 mpg in town.</TEXT>

One disappointment: our car needed service during the first week we had it (fuel gauge was inaccurate and we ran out of gas on first trip...showed 1/4 tank when it was actually empty.

<TEXT>My 2004 CTS lease was up and I was contemplating a SRX for the reliability in the snow. I decided to drive the 2008 CTS-4 and was amazed at the improvements. Both interior and exterior this is a superior car to the 2004-07 versions. Even though I got the standard engine, it still has more muscle than what my 2004 had. I was really thinking SUV, but once I drove the CTS it was a no-brainer. I like everything about it, the cabin looks like a fighter jet cockpit, the controls are easy to navigate, and find. The body is rounder and has a more muscle car look to it versus the boxy earlier versions. Be careful! If you drive it, you may not be able to resist getting it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fully optioned: AWD, black with black, DI 300hp engine. MSRP is $48,090. Which btw u cannot properly configure on Edmunds as the options they list differ somewhat then what Caddy actually will do. Without question the car draws attention. Ride is smooth & very tight though w/18" wheels expect to get plenty of road feel; which is a new experience with Caddy. I extensively test drove the BMW 5 & 3 series and this car matches them in >95% of handling characteristics. A- Trans is like silk. Extremely minor flaw in fit, but it would only be noticed by perfectionists :). Rides very quiet, except on hard accel where you hear it growl. Motortrend said motor is rough at idle, but mine is smooth</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>36 preset radio stations! Nav system is best have ever seen, beats MB and BMW. Pop-up screen is ultra cool. Again, this car is quiet with regards to exterior noise. The engine is also quiet except when really pushed, but the sound is cool. Remote start, keyless access should valuable in winter.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked up '08 CTS last day of August for my wife, wanted her to have the first one! This vehicle is outstanding. Tight, quiet, responsive with beautiful fit and finish. Ride is "just right", not too harsh and not too soft. Handling is superb. Feel sorry for those who paid thousands more for BMW's and Mercedes and got less car for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling. So responsive and easy to drive. Fuel economy is excellent and can be in low 20's in the City with careful, conservative driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Baby boomer who's never owned a new American built car (or any American car other than the old Pontiac I had in high school). Owned 2 BMW 530i's and a C280 Mercedes before that. Happy to see that there's an American car that finally measures up. Is it perfect - no? Probably the only car in its class not to have bluetooth, but OnStar is GM's baby so I can live with my bluetooth earpiece and use the OnStar when needed. What I am impressed with is the styling, performace, and functionality. Got the 3.6DI with 304 horses and its definitely quicker than the 530i. The audio with XM and 40GB hard drive and centerpoint surround sound is sweet. Escalade-like styling makes it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Escalade-like styling. 304 horsepower performance. NAV with XM and 40GB hard drive. Overall, an American car that actually competes with Beemers and Benzes and doesn't look or drive like my dad's Caddy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have now had my 2008 CTS for about 10 days. I took delivery of a black with black leather with the 304 horsepower engine and all wheel drive that also has the 18 inch wheel package with all season tires and the upgraded suspension, etc. I also have the premium luxury collection (PDQ) that includes almost every option available on the car. For background, I have owned the Lexus 400 series, the BMW 7 series, the BMW 5 series, the Audi A6 4.2, the Audi A8 and a number of other similar cars. This car is every bit as nice, particularly when you compare the price This car is fantastic. It is beautiful inside and out and the stereo and nav functions are great and easy to use. Go see it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is gorgeous with the black leather. The 40 gig memory stereo is outstanding--I have already loaded about 10 CDs and the sound is excellent. The ride is comfortable and yet very competent in the twisty turns. It is not as sharp edged as a BMW but overall it is better for day to day use.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The new CTS is a beast of a different kind. The car is completely redesigned but maintains the characteristics of the legendary first generation. The front view of the car is aggressive, low to the floor, and makes a statement before you arrive at your destination. The interior is by far the best, even topping BMW and Mercedes brands (which we were considering). The driving experience is stiff, responsive and very comfortable. A simple tap to the right of the shifter sends the car into sport mode and all 304 horses awaken to tear up the asphalt. Only one way to describe our experience thus far- Pure Gold.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior is stunning, but the interior is a major step up (even from BMW and Mercedes). Driving at night and experiencing the ambiant lighting is worth the price of admission. The Ultra View sunroof is a nice complement to the overall design.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I picked up the ride on Saturday afternoon and spent the rest of the day "oohing and aahing" and getting lots of looks from other drivers. I went from a BMW 325 and was very surprised by how well the car handled. I expected a big drop off in handling and there was none. Oh, and this car moves. I had smooth power and plenty of torque. If you're not careful, you'll eclipse the speed limit quickly. All this with an extremely quiet interior. The interior is beautiful--especially at night! The ambient lighting absolutely makes a huge impression. I like the HID steerable headlamps and if I'm not mistaken the back up lamps are HID as well. This is my first Caddy and I'm in love! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The built in Hard Drive roolz. The 300W Bose stereo kicks. DVD's in Dolby 5.1. The remote start works from far away. When I get to my car it isn't 140F anymore! The air conditioned seats means no more shirts sticking to my back! The stereo and NAV operate on verbal commands. XM is great. </FAVORITE>

I have not had one single problem with this car since I drove it off the dealer lot. The cabin is comfortable, quiet and has lots of goodies to play with. Th exterior literally makes heads turn.

<TEXT>Everything is fine with this car except the brakes have been squealing from day one. Initially, I was told that the problem was due to weather conditions, but eventually a dealership in Texas informed me that the quality of the metal used to make the brakes was inferior, and there was nothing to be done to resolve the problem, except to replace the brakes in hopes of getting some that do not squeak. I have been waiting for the new brakes for over three weeks. It is disheartening to be driving such a car and the brakes sound so terrible. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Disappointed, and surprised. Others don't agree. My father picked up the newly redesigned CTS last year as his third Cadillac. As I am a huge BMW fan, the 2008 CTS falls way behind. First, big improvement over the embarrassing interior design of the first CTS, but the looks deceived me. When I drove the car, I was disappointed in many things. The driver's seat is too tight and not appropriate for a luxury car. The dashboard looks beautiful, but its functionality is poor, and again too tight a fit. Acceleration is typical GM, jumpy with an intense torque if you don't have a gentle-minded foot. The dealer-installed rear bumper proximity beeper is downright annoying.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked at BWM 3 and 5, Audi A5, Infiniti G37, Lexus IS350. All nice cars, but the CTS is better. Traded in 3-series for CTS. Although exterior looks are subjective, this is one of most compelling-looking cars in the modern era. Interior is fabulous, as well. Nav system and hard drive are well-designed and easy to use. The pop up function for the nav is a great touch, as is the ability to display the radio info without popping up the nav. Ergonomics are excellent. I find myself looking forward to long trips - it just eats the miles. Glad to finally be able to buy an American car again without compromise. This car reflects serious attention to detail, baked in from lessons learned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very happy with my CTS-AWD. Since I live in the country in upstate NY I have owned awd vehicles for many years. I have yet to test this car in snow, although the fact that I can spin the tires on dry pavement does not give me confidence going into winter. I previously owned awd Acuras and BMW's which were excellent in snow. Most of the consumer reviews I've read are positive in regard to performance. My view is that overall performance is defininately adequatebut I find that unless I stomp on it, I feel like I'm driving a big four cylinder sedan. When floored the car takes off but not without a lot of noise. The Acura RL I had most recently had a more refined feel. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Wonderful driving experience. I particularly enjoy the acceleration and responsiveness of the direct injection. Transmission is flawless. Suspension is smooth and handles sharp turns remarkably well. Michelin 235/18" wheels hug the road and literally the car feels like it can drive itself. Interior materials and finish are superior to other vehicles in similar price range; exterior is bold and aggressive-looking. Reliability has been very good with 11,000 miles. 24mpg on the highway; regular gasoline. I'm very pleased with my selection. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After 10 months of ownership, I can say this is one of the few cars for which I have felt no regret after purchasing. It?s stunning to look at, inside and out and with the FE3 package and 6speed manual, it is a true driver's car. Most importantly, it is genuinely a quality piece. The body structure is incredibly solid; even with the stiff FE3 suspension setup it feels imperturbable. The interior isn?t just excellent for a car in the mid-40?s, it is actually nicer than a number of more expensive cars, with great fit & finish and superb materials. The Nav/Infotainment System is the best I have ever seen or heard. The exterior features Lexus like panel gaps.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Simply fantastic ride/handling balance and great steering feel with no dead spot and quick turn-in. If you like your ride BMW sport package firm, but never as harsh, get the FE3 package. Love the styling (in and out) and the Nav/Infotainment system is second to none.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just brought my new CTS after looking for a car for some time. The interior is beautiful and sold me. That was my mistake. I looked the car over admiringly since, and was annoyed that at $40K+ car would not have a rear bumper that was aligned properly. The dealer informed me that it is a manufacturing defect and it is normal that the bumper be out of alignment on one side of the car or the other. "The bumper is just too big" was the actual reply. I've contacted Cadillac through their web site and been given a very thoughtful run around. I could have learned to live with the defect, having been a loyal GM owner for 20+, but the responses and lack of care make me wish I had not bought it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle in February right off the showroom floor. Great fun to drive, sharp looks. I wanted the wood trim interior and the large sunroof. The car is very smooth on the road and handles well since it is rear wheel drive. Interior space is a bit tight. Storage cubbyholes and trunk space are spare. Quality issues have come up. Two weeks after the purchase the steering went out (fluid leak around the rack) - that was in the shop for two more weeks getting fixed (free loaner, thankfully). Just today the radio went out. I have the high end radio (no nav) with the 40 GB HD. The radio now only picks up AM intermittently. I am a little worried and even considering trading.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Former Lexus owner. Shopped against BMW 5 series, Audi A4 and Lexus 330. BMW dealer compares CTS DI with its 220 hp 3 series -- not even close unless you like stripped down, slow German cars. Lexus 330 was close, but is a lot more conservative looking and $3,000 more. With all the bells and whistles, none could come close to the Cadillac.

<TEXT>For the money, this car has the most beautiful ride and style I have had the pleasure to own. BMW cars constant service and arrogant dealer attitude sent us over to Cadillac. 100% satisfied with CTS, we have finally escaped the German car thing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Remote start which cools off the seats by turning on the A/C, before you even get in the vehicle. Quiet, Quiet, Quiet, my god does this car run almost silent on the highway. Super MPG for a strong 6 cylinder. AVG MPG 22 combined pretty hard driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm 36 and this is my second Cadillac, but this is no fuddy-duddy car like my '04 DHS was labeled. It's a car seemingly made for my demographic. I've never driven a car that turns as many heads and gets as many compliments and inquiries as this one does. The steering feel and handling are superb. The throttle response and manumatic shifting can take some effort to be smooth, but that kind of adds to the fun. The car likes to rev, but it lacks low end torque. It feels a little slow until you hit around 3500 RPM, at which point it takes off almost unpredictably quickly. I also have a strange odor coming from the air vents, and have since day one. Not sure what that's about.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior looks, steering wheel, iPod connection (though it should be digital, not analog,) shifter feel, interior design, including the real wood, the warm look that the forever- gray BMWs and Mercedes' lack, and the driving position. Running on regular gas is a very nice feature as well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Driven 500 miles so far; getting 29 hwy mpg; sound system is great; absolutely no problems at this point. Love the interior and exterior; white premium paint is beautiful. Love the Bluetooth phone connection; talking on phone as I enter car, automatically call is transfered to car, no buttons to push. Came from BMW 745Li, have never looked back since getting the CTS (see ya BMW); this is a very nice vehicle; good deal with dealer. Debated with self on Infiniti G35 and M35/45 and Lincoln MKZ; CTS beat both with features and more for the money; absolutely no regrets/second thoughts. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After 30 years in the working world and turning 55 years young, it was time to reward myself. And, with all of the imported sport sedans everywhere, I wanted to stand out in a big way. My CTS with a black exterior/interior was a dream come true. I never thought I could love a car, but this one makes me love driving to and from work. I've gotten compliments in Beverly Hills from Benz, BMW, Infiniti, and Lexus owners. The Cadillac art and design concept blends so well in this car. The marriage of the design, engineering, manufacturing, and assembly is really impressive. This car is one HOT HEART THROB! I want to drive it everywhere! I'm proud to own an American car again!!Go Cadillac! </TEXT>

<TEXT>The CTS is a nice car but it does have some weaknesses. There is a bothersome rattle in the dash, the brake accelerator set up is too close together and is dangerous in my opinion and the storage compartments are small.

I have waited 48 years for this car that yes still has room for improvement as you all have suggested, but we bought it for $8,700 under the sticker, cash deal and so far it hasn't disappointed me on my 100 mi/day commute on dirt hills and curves in North Idaho terrain. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I originally was looking at the Infiniti G35 or BMW 335. The Infiniti was a tremendous value, and the BMW had an engine that was simply irresistible. Then, out of nowhere, I cam across the CTS. To say the least, this car is an architectural masterpiece. It can stand out, unlike the BMW and Infiniti. Especially in Red. I get at least one compliment a day on that car, people always ask me what kind of car it is, when I say "Cadillac", thy always say "what?". </TEXT>

Note to Detroit: You have finally got something here. LEARN FROM IT!!! This car has style, performance, safety, ergonomics, reasonable fuel economy. Everything. I got the 3.6 with Premium Lux Package and all season 18" wheel Package. Absolutely LOVE IT! Just enough space, speed, sport and style to make driving a pleasure. It really felt good to buy an American car and actually be proud of it! Way to go GM. Don't let us down again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2008 CTS was shipped from the factory without grease in the axle, needless to say at 72 miles it was back in the shop. Cadillac told me that it may be a month before they had replacement parts (a new car shouldn't need replacement parts) well I insisted that they take one off the assembly line and ship it to me, which they did. There is a noise in the instrument panel (sounds like a fan running all the time) they say it is normal (the other 4 didn't have it!!!) Also I was told at the dealership that they found no insulation in the dash. There is a rattling noise in the sun roof. I am in the process of trying to get Cadillac to replace this LEMON!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hi, Bought a Direct Injection set up in the caddy and are really pleased with it. The engine and trans really team together. The insides are very well designed and well made with the controls easy to reach. 40 gig with 10 speakers is the best.Very easy to program the inside thru the computer set up. Body lines and panel spacing are perfect not like the older GM models. Trunk area is good .Got the all season tire pack. and is a good ride.GM could make bigger door compartments and standard garage door opener,but thats my only beef. Had 3 bmw's before and went back to GM, can't beat it for the money and quality. </TEXT>

<TEXT>For the first time in years, I not only considered, but bought a cadillac! Did my research and leased a 2008 CTS fully loaded. So far, so good. The car is fun to drive, has good acceleration for a luxury sedan, and handles great. The interior is well designed, well built, and beautiful. Sharp exterior. Only problem is the CTS seems to be everywhere. The dealer has been very responsive. I've only had the car for a couple of weeks, so the honeymoon isn't over yet. If things start to go south, I will return to this forum, with additional info. </TEXT>

<TEXT>While the 08 CTS is not quite as precise as the BMW 3- or 5-series (I've owned both), it is more than adequate in everyday driving and gives you back a much quieter, smoother ride than either of the Bimmers. The interior of this car absolutely blows away the competition. Compare this car, well equipped for about $43k (AWD, 3.6 DI, Bose, and almost everything except Nav with a comparably equipped 3-series (about $49k) or 5-series (even more), and you'll begin to understand what all the press is about. Fit, finish and materials are superb...and if GM can produce a reliable car (TBD), the Boys in Bavaria and elsewhere have a lot to be worried about. Did I mention this car burns regular?</TEXT>

I've got just over 1200 miles on it and it is still as tight and responsive as the day I drove it off the lot. I talked my wife into this car and she is happy I did(it was her 350Z). I got every feature available.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a AWD auto with all options. I've owned 20 autos in 30 years. This is the best design and execution of what I've owned and compared the CTS to. In two months, the CTS has been driven through heavy rain, ice and snow. It handles as well as any 4x4 I've owned. I traded my STS V8 and never looked back. It is by far the most tactile, entertaining, and visually pleasurable vehicle yet. I drove the A4 and 325 AWD's. In comparison, the CTS controls are the most intuitive. I could not figure out how to turn the BMW/Audi radios off during the test drive! With the CTS as good as it is, we cannot wait for the replacement of our DTS perfomance sedan. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My CTS has the FE3 suspension and the 304 hp direct injection engine. Performance: I like to drive quickly. Power, tracking, grip and dynamics are all excellent. Performance brakes are really powerful (but touchy at low speeds), and also necessate 18" wheels for snow tires - 17" won't fit. In sport mode the auto transmission matches speeds perfectly, a bit less smooth in regular mode. Interior is put together really well. Feels much roomier than G35. Seats very good. Controls very well thought out. Stereo with 40 GB HDD is truely awesome. My only quibble - needs more storage bins in front and a place for sunglasses. Overall I love it and find myself looking for excuses to drive.</TEXT>

But my new loaded Crystal Red 08 CTS is about the most perfect car I have ever had. It blows away just about every BMW, Audi and Mercedes on the road today. It is stunningly beautiful, excellent fit and finish, with options galore and the handling is remarkable. The styling and performance improvements in the 08 are obvious, but it is the subtle nuances and thoughful engineering that make the car a standout for me. I can't tell a Lexus from a Camry until up close, but there's no mistaking this Caddy at any distance !</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The hot 304 HP DI engine (26 mpg highway), intuitive simplified controls, great pop up NAV and HDD features, Ultraview roof, cooled seats, the ambient lighting at night, the high quality and style of the interior, adaptive headlights, the front end, the feel of a luxury car that performs precisely !</FAVORITE>
