<TEXT>I have not owned my CX7 Touring for quite a year yet, next week will be a year, have 10,000 miles on it. Blue smoke & black smoke pouring out from engine, turbo very noisy. Took it to dealership, they took it right in,problems with the turbo on this vehicle. Also poor fuel economy takes premium gas. Will not keep this vehicle once warranty is out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car on an impulse the day before I moved to Colorado from Texas. I had driven a Mazda 6 for a few years before after converting from Honda, and was really impressed with the company, so decided to give the new sporty SUV a try...it was a great choice! I normally don't like driving SUV's or trucks because they feel too big, and the CX-7 is a perfect fit for me! I have the black on black model and adore driving it. I take it to the mountains all year and it handles great, even in thick snow and icy conditions. I'm always the one volunteering to drive when it's time for road trips and such, and I usually hate driving. Overall, it's a great car with solid looks and performance.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Driving it, of course! Also love the looks, both interior and exterior. Holds my ski's in the winter and my bike and dog in the summer. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Yesterday was the second time in less than 2 weeks that the car broke down and I had it towed to the dealer. After about 2,000 miles I had to have the brakes replaced (the car shimmied with each application of the breaks). At 26,000 miles I was told by the service manager that I should replace my tires. No one at the dealership seemed to think this was outrageous. Last week, the air compressor quit and a belt broke. It took the dealer 4 days to repair. Yesterday, I heard a clunk, my battery light went on, then the car quit. I have 28,400 miles on the car. This is a lease vehicle. When I turn the car in 12/2009, I am done with Mazda!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned the vehicle 18 months. Replaced the factor tires at 12K miles, and the AC compressor at 26K. Both very unacceptable, (AC was covered by warranty.) With that said, this vehicle represents the most car for the money in its segment. I have a Grand Touring with Navigation and paid less than 29K. Try and find anything for that price that drives like this car. It has plenty of room, drives and looks great, and it get's around 20 mpg. My lease ends this November and I will most likely buy this CX7 at lease end. If you drive this car, and compare it to it to other SUV's, you will buy it. Compare this to an Acura MDX and you will have an extra $10K to buy a few extra set of tires.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We own a 2008 Lexus RX350 as well as this CX7. The CX costs almost one half the as much as the Lexus. I cannot justify the difference. The CX7 is THE VALUE proposition. Ride, handling, comfort,and its pep are truly outstanding. The CX7 runs well on regular gas but fuel economy is a serious disappointment. Mazda with all its talent MUST come up with a fuel efficient engine for this otherwise superior offering. The Bose surround sound system is an absolute must. Still a better value than the Lexus even considering the poor fuel economy. With better fuel efficiency while maintaining the peppy, fun to drive experience, this crossover would lead all competitors. Fit and finish are excellent</TEXT>

<TEXT>We didn't think about it until we decided we needed a roomy, sporty, sedan-looking SUV/crossover with superb safety features, incl AWD (Seattle) and actually test-drove it. This car has all those things and what a joy to drive! Although you do hear some engine and wind in the cabin, but some, and you can't hear the traffic/road noise. Amazing brakes/acceleration! Roomy enough, although the back seats are not as comfy as the front. Nice styling; interior could use better materials. Test-drive it! Not sure if people who complain test-drove it first, knew of mpg. Rav4=cavernous/dark/plastic;CRV=underpowered; Forester=comfy back seats, as much room; uncomfortable front; sluggish as the Rogue</TEXT>

<TEXT>Enjoyable to drive. We keep meticulous records and do mostly hwy, around 26mph but down to 16 in the city. Poor rear visibility. Paint is very fragile; hairlike scratches seem to appear spontaneously and are now everywhere (even when we've never taken the car to a cloth wash, only touchless). Interior floor covering is very thin and frail. Windshield washer tank is too small for a Michigan winter 50m commute. One year left on a 3-yr lease. Wont keep the car bc it will require too much attention. It did handle 2 winters and a couple of storms safely. Traction control works very well. Like most new cars, factory installed tires don't last long. 25K on this car will be max.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've enjoyed my first month of owning my new CX-7. It is a beautiful vehicle and it has carried me through 6" of snow and a blinding rainstorm already. I test drove many other vehicles in this category but the Mazda was, by far, the most fun to drive. That consideration was not at the top of my priority list, but it's superiority there outshined some of the smaller disadvantages. One thing I wish I had known was just how poor the gas mileage is. My vehicle is returning 13mpg in the city and about 19 mpg on the highway. I'm not even sure how a 4 cyl engine can possibly return such poor numbers. I recommend the vehicle with the caveat that you must be willing to accept poor gas mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just bought this car 2 days ago. We drove quite a few cars and liked how this one took off (on premium gas)! Ultimately chose this one because of the great deal we got. We're mostly pleased with it. What's up with the headlights? (We didn't drive the car after dark until after we'd brought it home.) There's a "line" across your field of vision which "divides" light and dark. It's not as obvious with high beam. Dealer service guy says it's normal. It's very annoying. Seats could be a little more comfortable. Quieter ride would be nice. Better gas mileage, too. Everything else about the car we're happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car after an accident in my Nissan Murano. The turbo 4-cylinder engine is surprisingly quick and there is no roll when taking turns. I only wish there were more cubbies for the driver. Its roomy enough to take family trips and compact enough for your daily errands. I would definitely recommend the CX-7. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My CX7 has it all! It's loaded! Mazda makes an excellent product! Only 2 suggestions. Automatic interior door lock; and change tire contract with supplier. Bridgestone tires are less then adequate. I am on my second set of Bridgestone tires at 16,000 miles. At this time my second set of Bridgestone tires is creating the tire indicator lamp to remain on my instrument cluster...roughly 17,000miles. Please change tire supplier. I am a city driver 135 per day, to and from work, maybe market, or resturant added. In all the vechicle is excelent.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As I read my fellow CX-7 owner's reviews I get the feeling that many of us purchased this car more due to looks and the ability to boast about having a turbo charged vehicle than anything else. Yes, the styling and presence of this vehicle cannot be denied. Nor can I say that it isn't fun to drive. However, if you are considering this car think about these few things: MPG - it gets at best 20 for me on highway and 17 combined on top of the fact that it needs premium fuel. If you think you are going to get away with less, the dealer will tell you that you can but you lose the whole point of having a turbo charged engine and might as well buy a 6 cylinder something else. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Been a proud CX-7 owner for about a month now and we absolutely love, love, love it! It's a great looking CUV/SUV that definitely handles more like a sporty car, especially when that turbo kicks in and you're hitting those curvy roads! The fun factor and looks factor sure does beat the pants off of a RAV4, CRV, or Murano. The Bose system is awesome. It's like having Bono & Edge jamming in the car with us as we're driving. My only gripes would be the locks not automatically locking when the car is in gear - kind of a no brainer to include. Also wished it came with a optional manual 6 speed. Bottom line: A-W-E-S-O-M-E vehicle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought my second CX-7. After 2 years, turned in a leased Galaxy Gray GT for a purchased 2008 Mica Copper Red GT, Sand leather interior loaded with every option. It is the first time ever I have repeated on a new vehicle with the same body style. The CX-7 was ahead of the styling curve and the other 'crossovers' are just catching up. Exception is the Infiniti FX, a great vehicle, but for price and value, the CX-7 cannot be touched. Some ding it for the mileage, but its reasonable for its class and the 2008-09 can use regular fuel (07 required premium). Performance (244 hp) and handling are like a sports car. Zoom Zoom is more than hype. My other car is a 350z roadster. Both are a blast. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased ours in Feb 2008 after test driving the Murano, 4Runner, Pathfinder and also a Civic. We love it! This is thing has excellent handling and great acceleration. This isn't a luxury car. It's the perfect car for people who love driving and need a more practical car than a sports car. The autostick is great but the regular automatic works so well that you rarely need to switch over to autostick. It's the best car we could find in our price range. We did have one warantee issue with a "Turbo Tensioner" that needed to be replaced at around 6mos old, but we were given a loaner and within 2 days we were back in it with no other issues since. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Test drove others, and nothing in its class compared to the super fun drive and sleek design of the CX-7. Gas mileage was not that different on others,and the CX-7 quality outshined their cheap feel. Looking forward to seeing how Mazda holds up over time. Drive it smart to maximize gas mileage, and the power is there if you need it. Disappointed in the stock stereo, the speakers are on the bottom of the front doors so I am always adjusting volume to hear radio. A little more roominess in front would be nice for taller people. A few more little inexpensive features -- rear cup holders, magazine holders for rear passengers etc. would have made me even happier. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We looked at Acadia, RDX, FX35, Rav4, and others. The fully loaded CX-7 was cheapest of the lot, and fuel economy not appreciably lower. Handles as well as my mother's fully loaded RX-350 for 20k less. Leather seats and interior fit and finish and exterior styling are all exceptionally good. A real wow factor on the nav system ergonomics and fold down. Bose stereo is more than adequate. Sunroof a bit small and don't like the "mousehair" ceiling material but they had to cut something I suppose. Was concerned about turbo 4 cyl reliability in out years and we drive cars forever so bought the 10 year extended factory warranty. A great car & joy to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had the car for a week and I absolutely love it. I went to buy the Mazda 3. The price on the CX7 was outstanding so I took a test drive. Wow what a car. I love the turbo 2.3 engine no problems pulling out when needed. When I first sat in the CX 7, I thought to myself, "Now this is a car". I drive 30+ miles each way to work and I want to be comfortable. The radio controls are a little out of the way and I always change the channel when I think I'm hitting the volume but now I use the controls on the steering wheel for everything. The one gentleman was correct the Radio Mute Button is fantastic. I think the car needs to add telescoping steering wheel to their tilt controls.</TEXT>

It's an absolutely fantastic car, very quick, the engine noise fantastic ,the steering is like driving a GTi and the build quality fabulous. Of course like every car in the market has its negatives. I have tried hard to find as many as I can but I only find one. Fuel consumption. Well at least you know it before you buy, it even though that Mazda misleads you with the 12.3l per 100km. The best i have managed is 14.5l per 100 km. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Leased this 2008 CX7 after looking at Chevy Equinox, Ford Edge and Murano. Mazda offered best value for the money. 2008 edition can take regular unleaded which is what we use however the performance and turbo really needs premium gas. At $4 plus a gallon, we will use regular unleaded and loose some performance. Moonroof and Bose stereo with power seats is terrific. A fun car to drive. I'm not tall but I wish the headroom was a little higher. Sometimes feel a little tight with near the sun visors. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had been restoring and driving a 1991 BMW M5 and after thousands of $$$, I finally blew the engine. Faced with needing a new Something, ANYTHING, I succumbed to the ads and tried the CX-7, the Speed6 and the Tribute. Even though I'd had three turbocharged Saabs in the past, the turbo lag nearly killed me a couple times, because I thought the thing would have acceleration similar to an m5... duh! Clearly it does not, but it IS fun, totally different looking and certainly fast enough. I've had 15 cars in my life, including 2 Vettes, Saab Turbos, etc. and this is a fun, easy handling SUV. Just don't try to pass an M5 in heavy traffic until you count a heavy turbo-lag 1-2-3!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove a lot of vehicles, both sedans and SUVs, before I got behind the wheel of the CX-7. Once I drove this, I forgot all about the Rogue, Outlander, CRV and Rav4. I also discovered why they say "Zoom Zoom." I drove a Honda Civic for 10 years, so this was a big upgrade in evey way. The only thing I miss about the Civic is the gas mileage (I am averaging 21- 22 MPG in the CX-7). I went for the Sport FWD model as I did not need AWD, leather or navigation. The bad thing about the Sport model is the crappy stock stereo. I will be upgrading the speakers!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my CX-7. This is the 9th car I've owned in my 30 years of living. It's also my favorite. The turbo is great and a thrill to drive. I know everyone keeps downing on the gas and mileage however, I have learned that it runs great if you can alternate between mid-grd. and prem. gas, also being very cautious with driving lately due to gas increase (not as much fun!). I can pull about 22-23 mpg in town and usually 26 hwy. Driving it hard it usually gets about 14-16 in town (we gotta have our fun sometime). Excellent, safe, dependable, not too pricey! Don't under estimate the performance till you try it.</TEXT>

Fuel economy has been as low as 15 and as high as 21. I have started using 87 octane and it seems to perform "OK". The HID headlights are wonderful and the heated seats are sure nice in the winter.

<TEXT>Have had the CX-7 for over 1.5 years and love it. We had to have some recall work done once. All the rest is simple maintainence. Gas mileage has been improving, we are getting closer to 18.5 in town now, as high as 25 mpg on the hwy. Mostly 22-23 mpg. Tubo lag is slight but you get use to the peddle and know how to activate it smoothly. It is a blast to drive on open roads. The brakes are great especially for emergency stops in town. We are retired now and don't travel quite as much, but we do use it on long trips. We have the FWD GT with navigation, sirius, everything you could get but DVD screen.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Touring AWD purchased 2/29/08. This copper red/sand leather sports wagon replaced my 2005 Tribute. Came with Sirius, 6 CD changer, fogs, wheel locks. The standard speakers are above average for a non-upgraded factory sound. The drive reminds me of my old Eagle Talon, turbo 4 AWD. The suspension is a bit firm, but for that it corners on rails. Nice steering wheel and tight steering feel. Other than the feeling of the vehicle size, a very sporting ride. My three kids (13,12,9) find the rear seat wider and with more leg room than the Trib. The leather seats are quite comfy and supportive, worth the upgrade.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove almost all SUV in this segment, Honda CR-V, Toyota Rav4, Nissan Murano, Arura RDX, Lexus 350, Infiniti FX-35 and found this SUV the most attractive one for the money that I paid, this suv is fun to drive with lot of style. It has all the qualities of the luxury SUV's with much lesser price. Only issue is premium gas and low mileage. But overall it is the best in its segment</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded my '02 BMW 330XI in for a 2008 CX-7 Grand Touring FWD. Best thing I could ever done. It drives and handles just like my Beemer did, minus the AWD. But here in KY, there is no need for AWD 99% of the time. I've gotten a lot of compliments on this, and there's not a lot of them around since the closest Mazda dealer is an hour away. I was worried about giving up a 6-cylinder for a 4-banger, but with the Turbo, it's even better than a 6-cylinder. Mazda really outdid themselves on this design.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Researched extensively prior to buying my GT three months ago. CX-7 beat out Acura RDX and Saturn Vue Redline. The Mazda is extremely attractive inside and out, and almost every area of its performance is at or near the top when comparing crossovers. Almost every GT stocked by Mazda dealerships comes with a Tech Pkg, which includes the nav system, sunroof, Bose/6CD changer, and rear camera.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Outstanding handling; excellent brakes; ergonomics right on; top of class in acceleration; manual mode on auto trans.--great for off ramps--you use the brakes much less. Bose 9 spkr Centerpoint sound system fills the interior; seats were very comfortable on 1,600 mile trip; many storage areas </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the CX-7 Grand Touring AWD with the technology package. This is a blast of a car to drive - great acceleration and handling (I haven't been able to feel any turbo hesitation). The interior is flawless - everything works as billed. The voice navigation works great and the sound system is terrific. Only drawback - no bluetooth capability. The seating is comfortable (both my wife and I are above 6 ft tall). The keyless entry removes a ton of hassles. The cargo area with the rear seats down is more than adequate for what life with 4 active children throws at us. All in all, a SUV with the soul of a sports car. Zoom zoom!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Keyless entry system, remote start, heated seats (for those Michigan winters), voice navigation, Bose 240 watt 9 speaker system, rearview camera, steering wheel (small, tight feel with touch controls), headlights with manual leveling, one touch rear seat release from cargo area. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Sleek. Fast. Comfortable. I got a great price on this. CX-7 was not a vehicle I was looking for, but stumbled upon. It drives so smooth I end up over 80mph before I know it. At least, smoother than the Jeep Liberty I traded in for this. You cannot believe how much power the engine has until your drive it. Interior functionality is much better than the Liberty. Wish it had a better stereo (4 speakers, distorts when loud). Still waiting to see the real gas mileage. Massive dashboard and front window takes some getting used to.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine has serious pickup. It looks fabulous, and makes a Ford Edge look like a brick. Very comfortable interior. Did I say the engine rocks yet?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just picked up our CX-7 a couple of days ago. For the last couple of years I have been looking at the Mazda 6, but after driving the CX-7 I was smitten. If you are considering this vehicle, I would skip the tech package. You can get after-market GPS for a fraction of the price, and in a few years when current tech is outdated you can easily upgrade. Not so if your GPS is built it. The Bose stereo is nice enough though. Only GT feature I might have liked would be the cool blue lighting and the auto-climate control, but neither were deal-breakers for me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I never thought I would buy an SUV, until this came along. The thing handles great and the turbo motor is awesome. The 18" rims are sweet. Wish they were chrome. Seat comfort is good, but I wish they were a little more grippy to go along with the solid handling. I can't say enough about the handling. It is on rails! period. The visibility is excellent, do not need rear view camera. I have garmin nav. much better than optional system. Tons of room up front which is all I care about, feels much roomier than EDGE. Although, premium fuel is recommended instead of required, I don't mind putting 93 octane in it, I feel the power difference between regular.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature is definitely the handling and power of this vehicle. It is so far ahead of the Ford Edge it is like nite and day. Mazda engineers must of been giddy when they drove the edge back to back with the CX-7, I was. Edge looks like a brick and drives like one. CX-7 looks like it drives</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I test drove the CX-7 Sport, I liked the car; however, after I purchased it and drove it for a longer period of time, I was not please with the rough ride. I was having second thoughts about this vehicle. Now, after owning the SUV for a month, I'm loving this SUV. I originally started out to purchase the Nissan Maxima until I saw this vehicle on the highway. It's roomy, the handling and braking is great, and I have gotten use to the ride. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I got the Black Cherry Mica (sexy color) and can't complain about the options (nav, moonroof, Sirrus, 6-disc CD, backup camera, auto start). I like the get up and go with this vehicle although I still don't understand the purpose of the manual shift. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The CX-7 does great at handling many driving conditions. It has great passing power on the highway. Avg. MPG on highway was 24. Using premium fuel and using cruise control really helps. I am not impressed with the navigation system. It is not as user friendly as the plug and go Garmins. Its point of interest database is very limited. Instrument cluster is easy to read and has a dimming switch. Bose sound system is great. Outdoor temp. display can be read when you toggle between the A/C temp and outdoor temp. I would have liked it if the outdoor temp was always visible in display above the steering wheel. Reliability is still unknown so I would suggest a short term lease.</TEXT>

Skip the technology package and put in an aftermarket radio like the Pioneer AVIC-Z2 or D3. Everything else with the car is wonderful!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 08 does not require high octane, but its recommended. If you buy a car with a turbo, expect lag, it's that simple. Yes it's a 4cyl but it's a turbo, so don't expect standard 4cyl economy. From a performance standpoint the car does not feel super fast off the line, but passing can be a lot of fun under full throttle, especially from about 40mph as 80 comes up really quick! The ride is stiff due to performance, if you want a soft ride buy a boat. Stopping ability is outstanding and cornering is very good. This car is the best of both worlds if you ask me. Driver's seat fits well and controls are all within easy reach. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ergonomics of driver's position, Passing power, brakes and handling. Opt for the Bose sound system its worth the money! Manumatic makes driving very fun! Transmission in 08 is great, no hunting between 5th and 6th. You can run 87 octane with NO problems, a major plus. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got this car for my wife, we looked at all the usual suspects and I'm so glad that she preferred the CX-7 in the Grand Touring AWD package. This car is a revelation in the price bracket; it is the better value X5. Being an ex racer and a Manager of a Ferrari and Maserati dealer I get to drive some nice cars, but this car is really good, with a few short comings, but they are insignificant to the positives.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the front three quarter look and the side profile. My wife loves the aggressive styling. The interior design is very good and I love the night-time instrument illumination. The precision of the steering is Sports car like as is the brake feel. I really wouldn't swap this car, it's that good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Curvaceous exterior is stunning, Unlike the boxy competitors in its class, it has a more upscale appearance on par with higher end CUVs such as the Infiniti FX35/45. Excellent & funtional interior. The piano black trim on the instrument panel and steering wheel is very modern and appears like something from a luxury car (ex. Aston Martin DBS). Bose sound system is excellent. The handling and feel of the car are on par with sport sedans. The steering is more heavily weighted, which translates to excellent control with the feel of a German sedan. Handling is smooth and progressive, with little body roll. 244bhp enginer is strong albeit with slight turbo lag. After 5 BMWs, I love the CX-7.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Curvaceous exterior; piano black instrument panel & steering wheel trim; handling is excellent, steering nicely weighted on the heavy side; steering wheel controls on spokes; 2008 runs on regular unleaded; HID adjustable lights; Homelink; 6 disc in dash CD; 5 star safety ratings (highest); 4WD system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this amazing SUV for about a month and could not be more impressed. I can't believe I ended up with Mazda. I looked at BMW X3, Audi Q7, VW Toureg, and the Nissan Pathfinder. After driving all of these I could not believe how close the BMW and the Mazda were. So, I bought the Mazda and saved some money. I couldn't be happier and I have not had this much fun driving anything in the last 15 years! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior, dual exhaust, 18 inch tires and standard alloy wheels. Love the dash set up and seats are very comfortable. Rumble of the engine sounds like the Porsche Cayenne!! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the vehicle for my wife, as it had all the options she wanted and was the right size. Very versatile, excellent quality and one of the best handling vehicles of its type. After 2500 miles we are very satified with our selection, no problems to date. Mileage has averaged 21 mpg for mixed driving. Great vehicle for trips. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a great value crossover vehicle. I was eyeing the Audi Q5 but it won't come out until late 2009. So I shopped around and compared different makes. The CX7 by far is the closest to the Audi specs. I got the sport version (no leather seats & moonroof). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT, turbo, Bose stereo system. I also love the color (liquid platinum), very unique. As you know here in Los Angeles, the most popular colors are silver, gray and black. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned this car for just under a month now, and am totally blown away by how much fun it is to drive. I have a Lexus ES 300, and bought this car for my wife. But I find myself arguing with her over who gets to drive this on the weekend. Great looking exterior, good looking interior, excellent functional features. I got the GT AWD with the technology package - just love the way the nav screen moves to reveal the CD player. For a family of 2 who needs more space but doesn't want to go for a large SUV, this is perfect. The way the turbocharger kicks in to give the car a boost, is phenomenal. Gripes include an over sensitive light sensor that dims the screen, no memory seats.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We decided to get rid of our 04 Grand Prix due to several bad water pumps etc. We finally settled on the CX-7 after looking at it and the Mazda 5. The car has a sleek sporty shape to it and handles amazingly well, almost better than our old sedan. It has a lot of pep for a 4 cylinder. It is relatively comfortable and fairly decent on gas mileage. We have put a about 1200 miles on it so far and really enjoy it. The only problem we have had is one of the window control buttons did not work on the driver's door.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my 04 RX-8 GT last week for the 08 CX-7 GT. I wanted something with better mileage, more room, yet still sporty and stylish. The CX-7 was perfect, because it draws heavily on the RX-8's style and isn't all that much bigger. I expected to be disappointed with its 4-cyl engine, but have been pleasantly surprised by its performance. It's peppy and the transmission is smooth, almost feels like a CVT. Love the manual shift mode. Leather is comfy and stylish with the stripe down the middle of the seats. Nav system is a dramatic improvement from my RX-8 nav system, the touchscreen is simple and has lots of features.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Advanced keyless system, nav system, MP3 CD capability, and the turbo-charged 4-cyl! I love that engine! Handling is excellent for a small SUV. It's nearly as grippy as my RX-8 was.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did not rate reliability since I have only owned the SUV for 1 month or less. The sport tuned drive train/suspension is awesome, really grabs the road. The pick-up (horsepower) is awesome. I got the 6 disc CD, Bose system, which is wonderful. My husband owns a Murano and this SUV blows it away from stand-still starts, but that might be because of the CVT in the Murano. The CX-7 is a bit louder with regards to road noise compared to the Nissan, but much more fun to drive/sportier. Don't be afraid of the 4 cylinder, it rocks. Of course it is going to be louder than most v6 engines due to the turbo. All in all I am very pleased.</TEXT>
