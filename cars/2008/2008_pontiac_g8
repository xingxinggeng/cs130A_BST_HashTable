<TEXT>I traded in my 2006 CTS-V for this car. While the V was definitely much faster, the G8GT is very aggressive and a very comfortable sedan. Overall, only a slight concession at half the price. I frequently travel I75 in Florida, this car cruises VERY nice at speeds of 80-85 mph. I have driven this car in excess of 120 mph a few times and it stills tracks nicely without vibration or float. Cars are my weakness and have had many - this 2008 G8GT is probably my overall favorite. I have removed all the badges on the car and people often ask what kind of car it is. "that looks great" and "I never heard of that" are usually the comments made. Lots of bang for the buck!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>In my last post I mentioned that a Magnaflow exhaust system would be delivered the next day. Well, it was and it made my G8 even more fun. The exhaust made the car sound great, with out making everyday driving to noisy like other systems I have had. Another upside is that gas mileage has gone up from a average of 16.4 to 17.1 in every day commute.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2008 G8 GT apparently will be my last new Pontiac. It is Pontiac number 17 for me, starting with a 1965 GTO. They certainly saved the best for last. I love this car! From it's sinister metallic black paint to it's red & black leather seats, it is a winner. Losing Pontiac is painful. Not continuing this car is a sin. GM - please wake up! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned my new G8 GT since December '08. It's mostly my weekend and pleasure ride and I can tell you, it's more fun (and practical with kids now) than my last sport's car, an '89 Corvette! It's too bad that Pontiac and the G8 will soon be history. GM finally got it right with this car and sadly, they are getting rid of it. My only hope is Fritz will listen to Lutz and will rebadge it as a Chevy or Buick and promote it, like Ford is doing with it's Taurus SHO. No one, except enthusiasts, really knew about this car. Buy this car soon before it is gone! It's spirited performance and awesome handling will have you hooked! Lastly, everywhere I go, I get lots of positive looks and feedback.</TEXT>

The G8 GT is the Road Runner of Sports Sedan. It is a car that the Poor working Slob can afford and have a Performance Sedan that may not be as plush as a BMW 5 series, but in performance, it can hang with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I did my research about the sport sedan segment, and while originally looking at the BMW 335i and the G35/37, the G8 GT captivated me. It is bigger, much cheaper, and nearly as much fun. It was just what I was looking for. Owning it has been a delight. I have never had any problems with the car, and the car does everything I expect from a sports sedan, and does them all well. It is not a luxury car like the BMW and the G, but it is not supposed to be. The G8 GT is what Pontiac should have been all along.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Without a doubt this is the best car I've ever had and Pontiac has ever produced. The horsepower and torque are perfect. I like to drive spirited and the car handles perfectly. The factory tires don't hold in wet road conditions but that will be rectified with new ones. I get 18mpg city and 24.5 hyw. I've had no rattles, or any maintenance issues other than the usual oil changes and such. I had the factory stripes put on mine and let me tell you the flat black on red will turn many heads. The gas mileage definately went down when I put them on (just kiding). I am not sorry for buying this car, to my regret it will outlast Pontiac. To sum it up, it's fun to drive you'll love it, buy one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my G8 GT, it will be 1 year on the May 23rd. The mileage has gone from 15 to 18 mpg in daily commute and and I do not spare the horses. I am just glad that with Pontiac going away I am luck enough to have the last and probably the most awesome car Pontiac ever built. I have heard rumors that GM may bring a Police version of the G8 to the US as a Chevy. The Holden Commador is the #1 police car in Australia.</TEXT>

Comfortable ride that was not expected but the car combines the low tech, high out put of a large V8, rear drive and fat tires with a high tech suspension, traction & stability control, shiftable 6 speed auto tranny for a civilized ride.

<TEXT>I was called by the Dealer at 9 am, when a G8 came in to test drive it. Arrived at the dealership at 10am. Loved the way it looked,and fun to drive.Three minutes into the test drive I told the dealer I'd take it, took it home that afternoon. Stopped at Starbucks on the way home, at the store had 5 people ask me about the car, they all said it was a amazing looking car. When I got home, some of the neighbors started asking about it. Already put on 150 miles was real fun to drive on interstate 75 in Florida. Like this car more than any car I've owned since 1969 (GTO)</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I have put about 1000 miles on our G8. It is FANTASTIC!! The acceleration is brisk, the handling is crisp and the interior is excellent. The look of the car is somewhat European (or Aussie!!). The fit and finish and ergonomics are all excellent. The leather with the premium package has an excellent feel. The seats are very comfy on road trips and the back seat leg room is generous. The steering wheel with the sport package feels very nice in your hands. The car is a great value, a lot of features and a lot of car for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I previously had a 2006 GTO and despite all the press, I really like the car. It was fast, reliable, and turned heads with the rumble of its exhaust. My children are getting a little older and the back seats of the GTO a touch small. I read up on the G8 and found it to be a 4 door version of the GTO with all the muscle, performance, and fun I want. Yesterday, I test drove on of the First 888, number 511 and drive home in it. It lives up to the reviews and is as fast and wild as any sedan... way better than the CTS. If you looking for a toy, carry the family, and bring the lawn mower to the shop, this ride is perfect. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove a Lexus ISF, Acura TLS, Lexus IS350, CadillacCTS, Dodge Charger, and a Camry Hybrid (for my eco moment). The price/performance combination win goes to the G8 GT. GM could spend very little more and have the fit and finish of cars far more expensive with matching performance. While the ISF was a pure rocket, at $62K there was not a $30k difference for me (assuming I could afford it). The G8 looks as good as it drives. I am 6+ and this vehicle fit me better than any of the above on the drivers side. The passenger side is about the same as the others..a little short on leg room. There is a minor fit issue with the hood where there is too much gap at the center. 9+ for me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance is quite strong. Good leg room. Great trunk. Visuals are upscale. Interior very quiet. Tight handling. Good stereo. Good headlamp combo.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked up the G8 this week... The best looking sports sedan I've seen in awhile. The body design alone will make the Euro lovers rethink things. The V8 packs some serious punch. I thought the interior would be chintzy, but it's not bad. Great leather seats and the leather steering wheel is nice. The dash could be better... but compared to past GM cars it's a big step up and not that far behind euro competition. This car is one helluva value and turns heads everywhere I go.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration... great V8, handling, interior fit, soft leather seats hug nicely, 6-speed shifts great... it doesn't need the tiptronic., rear wheel drive... The exterior design is the best in its class by far. Just the look of the car along w/ the performance makes me forget about wanting a BMW</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased the G8 and was excited the the rear wheel drive would give the ride and feel of a classic American car. Instead the car rides like a go Kart is jumpy off the line and has a gas pedal like a tractor. The speedometer and Tach are covered by you hands at 10 and 2 leaving the digital speedometer to be stared at before you can focus to see what the faint red number says. The shifter slips into Neutral if you rest your hand on the shifter. The rear view mirror requires you to flip a lever, not a problem but the mirror has so many buttons for OnStar and other gadgets that you are always hitting them. We are selling the car after only 250 miles at a 6K loss to just get rid of it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When you have a bad back like me, a vehicle must have a comfortable seat. What Pontiac doesn't tell you is that BOTH front seats actually have 10 way adjustments with the premium pkg. I've owned Lexus, BMW and Mercedes, and this car is the equal of any of them. The level of refinement is unbelievable for the price, and, I can actually sit behind myself with room to spare, which I can't even do in a Suburban, since I set the seat far from the steering wheel. Back seat comfort is also great.Throw in 361hp, great ergonomics, Bavarian looks, uplevel materials inside, and better than Mercedes build quality outside, and Pontiac's got a WINNER! Go for it before they're gone because of CAFE regs</TEXT>

<TEXT>Basically a $30,000 BMW 5 series. This is the nicest car Pontiac has ever put out. People keep asking me if it is the new designed. It is nothing like it. Pontiac built it differently from the ground up. Almost a perfect 50/50 weight distribution makes this car handle better than most. And the styling is very up to date, but does not resemble any other car out there. I would suggest at least a test drive from anybody. If you look at this car like any other old Pontiac you will definitely sell yourself short!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently bought my G8GT with sunroof, sports and comfort package for my wife as we our first child neccessitated 4 doors. My wife LOVES this car as do I. The power this thing has is incredibly smooth and I regularly find myself going faster than I should. The only weak areas of this car are the brakes, lack of navigation, no memory for the driver (my 98 vette has it, why can't a 09?), the manual knob for the seat back, and the lack of bluetooth in lieu of Onstar (boo). Other than those little things, which are forgotten once I put the gas pedal to the floor, this car is a rockstar. In fact, I will be looking for a nice used GXP once I pay this GT off. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Stranded on road one month after purchasing due to dead battery. In shop x4 due to vibrations, pulling to the right, surging when stopping, then the smell of raw gas. Three sets of nes tires have been put on the car in nine months. On the fourth time in the shop, we were told by phone the car was fixed, but was still vibrating and GM was having problems with the engine.

<TEXT>What a great car inside and out. It is pure fun. It is powerful and comfortable. I can haul around the kids with plenty of room to spare. Everywhere I go, people ask me what kind of car it is. I can 70 mph in a heart beat and cruise comfortably and quietly at 80 mph. The fuel economy hovers around 20 miles to the gallon. I get this even when I'm hard on the pedal. I would like the V8 to sound a bit more like a V8, but the wife doesn't know what it is all about this way. Overall this car has been the most pleasing to drive out of all my vehicles. I have owned Caddys, Mercedes, Jeeps, and a Porsche. I think GM nailed this one, it might be a bit too late though. </TEXT>

<TEXT>8 Months and 8000 miles and still love this G8 GT. Last month we had the worst snow storm in Oregon in years. The remote start and the heated seats made it a lot better to get out in it. With $1100 invested in studless snow tires I got every where I needed to go, the limited slip and traction control made driving in the snow no big problem. If GM does close down Pontiac, I hope that they also start importing the Holden Commador SS, or put the G8 in the Buick line-up. This is to good a car to just let die.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It has been about 7 months and 7000 miles since I got my G8 GT. I learned one thing this weekend, the G8 is not all about going fast. Going home from work yesterday on freeway was doing 50 came around a blind corner and traffic was stopped. With the braking performance of my 96 Monte Carlo (I traded in on the G8) in my mind I was hoping that would be just a light crash. Three things happened. I hit the brakes, I saw someting fly on the pasengers side and I was stopped 5 car lengths behind the car ahead of me. The flying things were cargo straps that were on the floor in the back seat area. They bounced off front and ended up in middle of front passenger floor</TEXT>

Even after 9500 miles I still look for excuses to drive it, sometimes making 3-4 trips to the grocery store (my wife thinks I'm reformed)! I have installed several bolt on high performance upgrades (cold air kit, tune for premium gas, shorty headers with high flow cats keeping the rest of the exhaust system completely stock). The car hauls now. If I get the jump on a corvette it's by-by baby! The seats are more comfortable than BMW or Mercedes, no kidding. it's very quiet, but most of all, it's fun, fun, fun!

No matter how bad my day at work has been there is this little back road on the way home that I can detour on to and just let the G8 hang out in the corners and all the stress of the day is gone. My 96 Monte Carlo never gave that to me. It just wouldn't handle the 30 mph corners at 60 like the G8. The G8 has to be the best handling american car under $30K not just the most powerful. Oh by the way yesterday I showed a Taurus SHO owner you don't go heads up from a stop light with a G8. If God drives he/she would drive a G8.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I still love my G8 GT but I did find a flaw. Minor $62 flaw. I am a auto mechanic and do things like my own oil change. When it comes to the G8 that oil change consist of 9 quarts of Mobil 1, and a AC Delco oil filter. Thank God for Costco who has the best price on Mobil 1, and Auto Zone for their price on Oil and filter. I have figured that $62 every 5K is very acceptable for what this super sedan gives back in return in performance and just fun to drive. Now that gas is below $3 a gallon it is even better cause can afford the premium stuff and you can feel the difference in performance of the 6.0.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my G8 almost two months now and like it more each day. The car is amazing to drive from the plentiful power to the superb handling, it makes you want to take the long way every where you go. The G8 is very comfortable and roomy in size and will easily accommodate taller individuals. Fuel economy is excellent considering this is a 4000 lb vehicle with a 361 hp V8 capable of comfortably hauling 5 full size passengers. Plus the G8 is half the cost of a 5 series and the V8 form is cheaper than a similarly equipped Mazda 6 The G8 proves GM has turned things around and is back on track!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Am going on 5 months with my G8 GT experience. There are minor flaws I have found if you can call them flaws. The most exciting one is that when you step on the gas in anyway less than very gentle it responds like a startled cat, it flat jumps and screams for red line. I have also noticed that once I shift into sports mode or manual mode and stand on the throttle, the car changes from a docile car to a beast, and seems to stay that way till I shut it off and drive it again. It may be a glitch in my G8's computer. I will not go get this if it is a glitch.. I love it. This car loves to be driven. If you love driving you will love this car. It rocks!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have followed this car since I heard about it being available in the US. Overall this car is the best bang for your buck if you want a sport sedan. I looked at a few imports and some other domestics but the G8 won hands down dollar wise. The engine is excellent. I live in NYC and the gas mileage is low in the city (10-12 mpg) and when the highways are packed I see the same results. But when the highways are clear I see 20+mpg easy. For daily driving the suspension is fine, seats are comfy, exhaust is quiet but open up the engine and it sounds sweet. I had this car for about 2 months and I still smile when I turn her on. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Has been just over 4 months since I bought my G8 GT. It has only gotten better with time. With gas prices down a little from when I bought it have switched to premium. The premium is not required but it do bring the G8 GT to life. Merging onto a freeway can be a little unnerving, if you step down on the throttle to aggressively, you go from 6th to 3rd gear and go from 45 to 70 in a heart beat. For a door factory (4 door car) the handling is awesome. This car does not fear windy roads. In manual mode in 3rd gear 20 mph corners become 50 mph corners. If you want to love a car like you did when the built muscle cars the G8 GT will fill the bill, and accommodate the family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I still can't believe this is a Pontiac - I guess GM finally got it right. The quality is almost BMW, the performance is better than the 5 series, and the cost is amazing for a new V8. I got a "deal" via the GM employee pricing, but would've been nice if the dealer negotiated - they wouldn't budge a dollar, insisting that GM won't let them. Regardless, I'm so far very happy w/ my purchase - I just can't get use to people's reactions when they it's a Pontiac! lol</TEXT>

<TEXT>All i have to say is congratulations Pontiac for creating the car I have dreamed of. I upgraded from a 2004 Grand Prix, a car that i have thoroughly enjoyed for all of the 104000 miles i put on it and i was completely blown away. The G8 GT is in my opinion one of the best sport sedans ever produced. It is gorgeous inside and out. It doesn't have all that goofy euro sport sedan styling, just big fenders and a beefy body. 100% American muscle. I would recommend this car to anyone! Pay the extra for the V8 its worth it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>3 months and 3500 miles and this car has come alive. You stand on the gas and there is a sound you cannot believe till you experience. You look at the hood to see if it is collapsing as this monster 6.0 sucks air in, it makes a more awesome and powerful sound than my 70 426 Hemi Cuda did. If you love cars you will love the G8 GT, all you have to do is test drive it and you will want it. If you want a ultimate performance you can afford this is the best deal out there,.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Waited and waited for GM to realize their mistake of killing RWD and for the buyer incentives to come into play to get the price down. Aside from the typical oil and battery display complaints and my aversion to everything overcomplicated in the controls of ALL new cars, this car is a more than fitting replacement to my 1991 Caprice LTZ. Took it on a 1,000 mile road trip first weekend and we love it. Mileage is as advertised, performs and handles like a dream. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't kill it after 3 years like the GTO, I keep my cars for a long long time and need parts availability (pads, rotors, alternators, starters, etc.) and dealer parts and knowledge for the harder stuff.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Starting month 4 with the G8. I am getting comfortable with all of the switches. This car has proven that all of the press hype is not hype, it is fact. It is the best value that any car manufacturer has on the market for the price. If you want a real car, with real performance, room and quality this is the car. You can spend twice the money and get something like and buy a 5 series BMW, or you can buy the G8 GT get the same performance and have lots of money left over to bay the person at the gas pump. I love American Iron so I will pay at the gas pump instead of at the dealer. I vote to make Australia the 51st state.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my G8 GT for almost w months know and the more I drive it the more I love it. Getting use to where all the switches are and comfortable with it. Only big expense besides gas has been a oil change. 8 quarts of Mobil 1 are not cheap. The more I drive this car the more impressed I am with it. Merging into freeway traffic can be almost frightening. Any thing more than 1/4 throttle and you are going from 45 mph to 80 mph in about two heartbeats. Even after 3 months it is still hard to get more than 16 mpg. I think that has something to do with that thing Pontiac puts under your right foot. It keeps sucking your foot to the floor and putting a smile on your face. LOL </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am really impressed with my Pontiac G8-GT. It's a real rocket but it doesn't guzzle gas. It holds five easily, although I rarely ever have more than two of us in it. Most important, is the fact that it does everything my friends BMW 550 does at half the price. I was really impressed with how well it's built and how solid it feels on the road. It handles very well and imparts a sense of confidence when I drive it. I guess if you need the snob appeal of a BMW then spend the extra $30K otherwise this G8-GT is a great buy. I had one of the first GTO's and this reminds me of it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded an 04 Tahoe on the car and have been quite pleased to date. The v-6 has plenty of moxie with just the right amount of cool in the styling. The fuel mileage could be closer to 30+ I would think, being it has a 5 speed auto. The rest of the car is still so new to us that we are still figuring out items. At first blush the one thing that sticks out to me is the tilt wheel. Seems it could have been more akin the tilts in pick ups and suv type vehicle. Not much range of motion, especially when one is in egress mode. Getting in and out is a bit challenging. I was also a bit leery about buying a vehicle that had the (odd size) wheels. Here's hoping the tires wear well. Expensive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is very beautiful in the exterior design. The fenders around the wheel area are amazing. The aerodynamic feel to it is great. The upshift is smooth as possible. The gas mileage is much of a concern when you know what your getting into (G8). The interior is also awesome. No Navigation or XM radio but the thing is that you are going to have to pay for XM after your first year. And you can a navigation anywhere. The Red Digital Battery thing is okay not the greatest but its not the biggest of concerns in the fun car matter.</TEXT>

It feels a little less powerful than it actually is until you realize how much faster your going than everyone around you, its pretty smooth for a car that handles well and accelerates so fast.

<TEXT>Had it for three weeks. Still can't wait to get in and drive it. Extremely impressive performance, great stereo, slick looks, but unimpressive gas mileage - 17/24 mpg. Ad says "V6 Fuel Economy"...mis-leading to say the least. My daily driver is a '00 Bonneville that gets 25/32 with the 3.8 L V6. I bought it for the overall value and "driving excitement", not the mileage. Had a tough time deciding between G8 and Charger R/T. I think I made the right decision. Beware, gas cap door blew off in the automatic car wash! Dealer wants $80 to repaint it. I say it is a design flaw.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It has been a month since I bought my G8 GT. I thought right after I bought it, "Gas prices are going out of site, what did I do?" The answer after thinking about it and a month with the G8, I don't need steak every night, hot chili and hot dogs are just fine. The fun of driving a real car that has great performance, is more fun at age 61 than a Japanese car that gets 30+ mpg. The fact that what ever situation I get in I can get out of. Can a Honda Civic that is stock accelerate out of a situation? Hell no. Or stop as fast as the G8. There is more to a car than gas mileage. Ability to handle any situation with power brakes or acceleration can save your life.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I chose the V6 3.6 because it is absolutely strong and fast enough from me and I don't need extra 110 horses in the stables... The car is simply a fun car to drive, easily comparable with BMW driving qualities and performance. The gear is great, sporty if necessary. The engine has plenty of torque and it pulls great almost in any situation. It is huge on the inside, plenty of leg room for everyone. The luggage space is also huge and can carry two strollers easily. I highly recommend it for people who like a sporty, yet family friendly car. one warning, the base models don't provide extra gadgets or sophisticated hi-fi, it is quite basic, I like it that way, except for changing the speakers.</TEXT>

This car gets more comments about how great it looks and impresses more people than the first car I had that was super impressive, and that was a 1970 Hemi Cuda. It is also as much fun to drive as the Cuda, and handles way better. In one review someone commented about no release for the gas filler door. The gas door lock is part of the door lock system. If the doors are locked the gas door is locked. I like that don't have to pull a lever, just make sure the doors are unlocked, and who locks their doors when they are at the gas pump. you know you are being robbed.</TEXT>

I cannot say the handling of the car is sports car like but it is very good for a four door sedan. Brakes are very good and stop with confidence.

The BMW sure is nice but I think my friend will be disappointed when he sees the G8 GT for half the price. If you keep under 65 you get remarkable 25-27 MPG. It eats gas just idling. 15 is no problem in the city. First impressions: besides the tough look and motor is the front interior,and excellent seats. Warmers work great and no need for extra lumbar support. Handles good and is very fast. Reminds me of the Catalina I had with the special 400 plus motor that was ordered from the factory.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went to the dealer to purchase a G6 GT sedan after looking at many other mid-sized vehicles. While waiting for the sales person, my wife and I looked at a G8 sedan parked on the lot. One test drive later, we were driving it home. I purchased this car for work (sales) where I drive hundreds of miles daily. With all of the freeway work being done and a particularly harsh winter, the roads are brutal but the G8 does a nice job of smoothing out the bumps without sacrificing a tight, controlled ride and excellent handling. Plus, my clients, many of them 6'+, are very comfortable in the back seat. The styling is also very sporty without looking "boy-racer"- ish. Nice job, Pontiac!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is very fast (6.0 is great), handles great, and is very hard to find. Dealer looked for weeks before we found a GT that would do. It still was not the color we wanted (we got red wanted gray, but car does turn heads) nor did it have the performance package, but it does have the sunroof and leather. Great seats, great steering, really really fast. Dealer only discounted $500 off the sticker, but still good value for so much car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a car with plenty of room, that is very comfortable to drive, handles like a sports car, and has the performance of the early muscle car. Truly a fine car. The only problem I had was getting one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I decided a while ago never to buy an American car again. However I came home with a 4-door Corvette! Couldn't wait for the gxp and I must say this car is great! I wanted a Corvette or that new Camaro but it's taking forever. It has a ton of interior room more than a charger srt8 which I drove. Gas mileage is okay but if I wanted better I should get a Toyota Prius! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased a G8 GT, liquid red. This is a big car with the handling of a tiny European sports car. Turn radius is amazingly tight. Power is incredible-almost as good as my 400 HP GTO. The On-Star system is a tremendous value, as is the hand's free phone. Interior is spacious and comfy. This is a car to take on a back road in the hills. It loves curves and turns. It is a joy to drive. Pontiac & Holden have hit a home run with this beast. I'm sold on Pontiac, and GM will have my business for years to come.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V-8 with 361 HP tops the Fav list. Agile, responsive handling ranks a close second. This is a car that begs to be driven and yearns for the open road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>"Mean" look vehicle. I have never owned a vehicle which causes so many heads to turn as when I drive by. I even had a Pontiac dealer who had not yet received a G8 chase me down to look at my car. I have the Sedan, which is quicker than a lot of V8s. Some cheap features such as flimsy door handles and no XM is disappointing. Cheap stereo controls on the steering wheel. Flip open key looks cool, but seems flimsy and surely will not last. Hugh trunk and great back seat leg room. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the best Pontiac car ever. I think it blows away the gto by comparison and has a huge trunk and back seat. Head room is miles long and for a 6'3" 240 pound guy i am sooo comfortable while driving i strongly recommend.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a GREAT car. Believe everything you've read and more. If you drive this car, you will buy it. It is absolutely incredible and I'd compare it to any YUPPIE mobile. I have to fight my wife on who gets to drive it!! Go buy this thing now and show GM that when you finally build it right, we will come back! My kids get up every morning and say hello to the G8 - it's that awesome.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car handles and rides incredibly. I love everything about it except the following: tilt wheel has a lever which means to move the wheel out of your way, you must move the lever and then relock every time; FM reception is fair; gas filler door is a push from the outside design. It should be a inside release or have a finger opening. The interior materials are way softer than my buddy's 530i; his door handles dig into your knees and hurt. Trunk and seats are huge. Great effort, great car. Buy one now!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I think this is my 4th Pontiac. Just turned in my '04 Grand Prix GT2 for the G8. Prior to that I had 2 Grand Prix GTPs. Only had it 3 1/2 days. This car looks more like a BMW and handles like it! Quite a bit heavier and more responsive that the Grand Prix. Like the GT but decided that I didn't really need the V8 and the V6 really has plenty of power. The only difference in the two are the quad tail pipes and the clear tail light covers on the GT. The V6 has dual tail pipes and red light covers. I agree the amp meter and oil pressure displays need to go. Would like to be able to select items from the DIC and and transfer it to this display. Could probably be done with a computer upgrade.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have number 663 and just picked it up on Monday. The car is one of a kind it reminds me a little of my e30 m3. Very redefined in every letter, and speaks to the driver during acceleration. This car will make a statement and I'm glad I have one. I can drive my g8 with the likes of BMW and Lexus. I can also run the boys on the weekend if I like. The answer for any mid life crisis.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hey folks! Talk about an AWESOME car with power! For me being a female I did my homework on this vehicle. I waited until the G8 finally came out. I owned a '97 Grand Prix and held unto for 11 years (which I just sold today, 15 Apr 08) because I DID NOT like the body style of the Grand Prix from 2004 to 2007. Hubby got me the Liquid Red G8, V6 engine, with the comfort package & premium package, no sunroof. For it to be a V6, this car has some power almost like the GT V8, but in my opinion much better gas mileage. So ladies, don't be intimidated in purchasing this for yourself. This is one HECK of a machine. You will have no regrets with this car! </TEXT>

<TEXT>So far so good. All of the advertising leading up to the introduction of this car has been right on point. The balance of handling and the pure power of the V8 combine to make this the best performance bargain out there. GM has always had a little numb steering, even in the two Vettes I've owned. This car has the spot on steering feel that performance cars should have and driving becomes a pure pleasure once again! The fit and finish are world class and the few quirks (as with any car even my 2004 Porsche 911 Targa) are not all that big of a deal. Home run Pontiac! Go test drive one and you'll want to buy it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wasn't looking for a new car but couldn't resist this when it came out. I can't wait to go out driving every day and look forward to an excuse to go for a longer run. The performance from the 6L V8 is simply amazing for a stock $30,000 car and it handles like a dream. Very comfortable seats (I'm a physical therapist and seats are important to me), great driving position. Spacious rear seat. Excellent stereo. Great trunk space. Did I mention the engine and the performance?! Even managing decent fuel economy (20+mpg) on longer runs thanks to cylinder deactivation.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, performance, gear box (I know it's an auto but can get tiring with a manual around town and there is the option of manual shift). Excellent seating position</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Been watching and reading about this car for months. Finally got to see it and test drive it on a rainy night. Amazing performance, handling, ride and comfort. Has just the right features and accessories to make it the perfect car. What a treat to drive. Absolutely the most exciting vehicle I've ever owned. A good value, even at MSRP.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration, braking and cornering. Comfortable supportive leather seats w/heat. Large trunk and a sunroof that slides into the headliner. Fantastic sound system, and of course, that awesome front end look.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased a ve holden commodore S which is the same vehicle as the Pontiac g8 (different nose & vents on Pontiac). It is a six speed manual shift & does 0-100 km/hr (66 mph) in 5.6 secs and standing quarter mile in 13.4 secs- so it performs brilliantly. It is also well built and handles like a sports car. It is also very well equipped-turns head - black with silver stripes. Very pleased with it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I previously owned a 2005 CTS-V and traded on a G8 GT after test driving it four three hours... Thanks to my dealer for that. The car is underpowered compared and doesn't brake as well as the caddy. However the fit and finish are great, the auto with tiptronic is awesome. I never thought that I'd be that guy that got tired of the stick but it happened. A loaded V8 sedan for $30K is awesome and I agree by a Garman Nuvi for $200 if you want NAV it will crush any in car system. It's a Holden with better versions still to come but this is a great car a family sedan with the sports when you want it and everyone who sees it says WOW it looks like a BMW - I love it. For the money you can't beat it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Jog dial to scroll through the screens, Sunroof, TONS of space, remote start, flip out key, smooth power application, Telescopic and Vertical steering wheel adjustments (That should help Lloyd with his hand placements - plus he could always increase the intensity using the + - buttons also)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well Pontiac outdid themselves with this car. Not only is it a beautiful looking car with a great comfortable interior. I have two kids and possibly a third. I know I can fit all three seats in the back seat with no probs. The best thing of all is the power this car has is unbelievable and I've yet to push it because of the newness of the car. (no kids during testing) It's sleek,comfortable, and rides like a dream. I can't give this car a perfect 10 because I don't know how reliable it'll be. As far as gas I give it a 10 because I knew what I was getting into buying a V8 and I think it's getting pretty good mileage for a beast of a car. I highly recommend this car. U won't be disappointed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the interior and interior features of this car. From the display screen to the heated seats and did I mention the automatic engine start. Comes in Handy when you have a cold natured wife and kids to get ready in the mornings. Also the trunk is huge as well. Will definitely help come vacation time</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my g8 for a week now. I like it a lot. I am averaging 16 mpg but is all city driving. I have put 200 miles on it with out a problem. Car is much more comfortable then my camaro z28 and feels quicker too but have not given it a work out yet. Have to wait till I get some more miles. The one thing I wish it had is displaying a the title of a song when listening to the radio. My wifes 03 Grand am does this and it is a nice feature. I can't tell when the active fuel management kicks in. It would be nice to have some kind of indication on the dash if you are in 4 or 8 mode. Handling is great with little body roll in sharp corners and tons of room. This is a great value car</TEXT>
