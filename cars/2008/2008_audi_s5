<TEXT>What a great car to own and drive. I looked at the new M3, AWD250, 335Xi. This is a great daily driver - even though Minnesota winters thanks to AWD. Handles great and performs like a dream. Not to mention the downright serene exhaust note. Suspension is firm enough to eat up the turns, but soft enough to not leave you bruised upon arrival. Great GT cruiser. Getting MUCH better MPG than the sticker claims even with fairly aggressive driving. B&O Sound system is great and a must have add on. Every time I get in this car I'm glad I went with the S5. A great blend of performance and fun - yet supply enough to be a daily driver. Now an Audi convert! (past cars MB E5004matic)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance is amazing. The suspension is great - perfect for a daily driver. Any firmer and you'd wish it was just a track car. Downright heavenly exhaust note - I do wish this was a bit less muffled. Great Torque/HP range from the engine...from 2.6K RPMS it's got plenty of pulling power.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had my S5 for almost a year. Still love it every time I get in. Great overall experience. This is my 4th Audi: A8, 2 S4s and now S5. My favorite overall. Greatly improved fit/finish compared to my 2 S4s. Great in snow with high-performance snow tires. I would buy this car again without hesitation. Enjoying it too much to worry about mileage. I didn't get it for the mileage. Still like to just look at it after a year-great design.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Impeccable interior. Great handling. Effortless acceleration. Really takes off and grabs the road when you down-shift at higher speeds. Best looking non-exotic on the road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Audi S5 is the perfect all-around all weather car. In the time leading up to my purchase I drove the new M3, RS4, A5 and S4. The S5 is the perfect combination of performance, comfort, style, features and audible pleasure. I loved driving the M3 and was close to deciding on that car but I was a little worried about RWD in the northern Wisconsin winters that can make driving even an AWD car a challenge 6-8 months out of the year. After nearly three weeks with the S5 I can say I am thrilled with all aspects of the Audi. I disagree with people on the MPG, for a car of this type, the MPG is great. I drove 200+ highway miles today and got 23mpg. That is up from 19mpg in the 1st 1000miles. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Suspension, engine transmission are outstanding. Interior design and fit and finish are great. It is by far the best looking production car available today! The ride is perfect, firm but compliant. Goes over road imperfections like they aren't there. That's the biggest difference between S5 and M3 </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far, so great. I traded a 2007 A6 4.2 for this S5 I have driven a few cars in the last three months, A5, new M3 and my S5. The S5 is the perfect blend of performance, comfort, style, quality and all weather security. I really liked the M3 but was nervous about the Wisconsin winters and RWD. Then I saw the S5 in person, drove it and fell in love. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, six-speed, seats and style, inside and out. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Took delivery back in late jan 2008. Have logged close to 2500 miles in mixed driving. Car handles phenomenally and is a head turner wherever I go. Build quality is impeccable, interior design and exterior styling make this one unique car. Also looked at the 335xi but the audi interior was more aesthetically pleasing, this layout is very driver centric. Although the car is heavy handling is precise and the car feels like it's on rails, especially in the twisties where it simply attacks the corners. Biggest downside is the v8 gas gulper but the car is such a joy to drive that the sub par gas mileage becomes bearable.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior and exterior styling, trunk space, build quality, B&O stereo, throaty exhaust note</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my Audi for about 3 weeks and have had many positive comments about the car. I will say this is my first Audi but I am overall a lover of cars, owning everything from SUV's to American Muscle cars to Japanese rides such as the G-35 coupe. Positives-The S5 is an excellent ride, not too rough for a sports car, ergonomics are great, V-8 is very responsive in all gears. Day time running lights turn countless heads. I-pod integration a must. Spacious trunk. Tight handling. Negatives- electronic speed limited. No voice activated Bluetooth. Horrible gas mileage. No standard all season high performance tires. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I-Pod/cell phone integration , Quattro AWD, redline 7000RPM, rear parking assist, push button start,aggressive styling and wide stance. Exhaust rumble.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The bluetooth may bring some connection headaches...but it's a hell of a machine. Key functions may also not be as well connected. Nonetheless, very comfortable and extremely smooth in gear shifting. It has an awesome shape and look to it. The base is low so parking and going thru dips may scratch the front bottom bumper</TEXT>

<TEXT>I live in the Chicago area so my initial concerns were: a) what do I do if it snows and b) the gas mileage ain't pretty. As for the snow - of which we saw a near record amount this year - the S5 drives exceptionally well. I dumped the summer performance tires within hours of picking up the car replacing them with high performance all seasons. The car's power is so easy that driving slow in rough conditions is easy. The gas mileage is terrible.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Audi interior. Best seat comfort there is. All of the controls are there for you and interior materials are first rate. Band & Olufsen stereo is a bargain for the sound quality. The 6 speed manual is a pleasure to use and the S5's handling and responsiveness is great fun. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my third Audi and by far the most fun to drive. I've owned a 2000 A4 2.8 Avant and 2006 A3 2.0T and this upholds the Audi reputation for excellent interiors and beautiful exterior design. This car is beautiful by looks and in driving. The growl of the V8 had me from the start, but sitting inside you get to appreciate the attention to car-driver intuitive design. The six-speed manual has a nice feel, but 1st can be a bit abrupt, but it's a bit new so too early to judge. Gas mileage is a definite concern (~12-22mpg), but only time will tell.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Technology package is a must with the advanced key entry and the back up camera. It's not just a camera, but has computer overlay graphics to aid in backup and parallel parking. iPod integration is perfect, copying the iPod display. Bluetooth support to import phonebook is awesome!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>To be a first time Audi owner with a 2008 S5 is the best car experience I've ever had. The car is absolutely stunning from any angle and light setting. I have soccer moms looking at the car at stop lights! Not very easy to get used to I might add. The performance and V8 sound more than equal its stunning looks. Interior Fit and Finish are Audi's best, and the MMI is easy to use and informational. The Bang & Olufsen stereo is amazing, but its usually muted since I love hearing the V8 engine noises inside the cabin, and also with the windows down. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Tech in this car is just enough, zero over kill. Useful features that are easy to figure out and easy to use. All controls have the right amount of resistance (detents) in their action. Makes the controls feel expensive and precise. I love the rims and tire package too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 17th car, following just about everything but Audi (Porsche 928 and 996 Turbo, SL500, BMW 735, and assorted Ford and Chevy cars). Hands down, this is the best automotive execution I have driven. I'm a nut for picking apart failed user interfaces (my job), and this car has not disappointed me, however I'm only about 75% familiar with it after 400 miles. MMI is a bit complicated, so the Driver Information System and steering wheel controls are fabulous; you can do 90% of what you need very quickly, intuitively, and with eyes forward. IPod integration, including playlist support, is great, and will save lives. The motor and drivetrain is wonderful.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Technology and bluetooth/iPod integration (phone book on my Blackberry Curve appeared). Torque will put a grin on your face. Exhaust note is a perfect rumble. Interior switchgear and overall fit/finish is world class. Car has an exotic feel about it, great value.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>1st S5</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Being the 1st review means I haven't had it long enough to really have good answer to some question. Went in for an A6/R6, was shown this "one and only" by a friend and 5 min later it was mine. This car is as nice to drive and it is to look at. The DI V8 has such a unique sound at first I though there was a miss, but it's growing on me. Waiting for more mileage to go stand on it. Quick checks tell me that MPG is 22+/- if your on the road. This is a 6 speed and love the way it shifts. If I had the option I would have got the automatic but would have to wait for 4-5 months and maybe not in a S5?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Driver control of all things fun are very integrated. Exterior styling - WOW! That's what made it an instant buy. Front running lights should be renamed to front running Smile due to their combined shapes! Did I say the exterior appearance?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Until recently I have owned and driven BMWs, the most recent being a 330 xi. That was the last Bimmer I will ever buy, Audi has converted me to a loyal and longterm fan. I have been curious of Audi as a brand for some time and the look of the new S5 was what it took to get me to go and have a closer look. Wow.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quattro all wheel drive. It makes the X drive from my BMW seem defunct and subpar. 4.2lt V8 that goes up to 7000 rpm. The way the thing looks inside and out! The performance and cornering! Everything!</FAVORITE>
