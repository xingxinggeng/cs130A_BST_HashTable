<TEXT>Bought this 10 months ago and am looking to trade it in even though I know I will take a loss. has tons of cargo space and leg room, but the motor works too hard. Doesn't feel like it shifts properly. Not very darty--takes a long time to accelerate. Gas mileage for me has been consistently at 18 miles and less. I have never gotten even 19 mile per gallon as stated. 14 gallon tank is small--feels like I am always at the gas station. radio and amenities are positioned well for a comfy ride. Great heat and A?C but is hard to hear radio over it--not strong speakers</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy,with lots of storage. I love the color, too! It looks good! Unfortunately, good looks is about all it has going for it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased this SUV after having a 4 cyl 5 speed Sante Fe for 4 years & was quite happy with both service & reliability with Hyundai vehicles. Was looking for something comparable & found the 4 cyl 5 speed Tucson surprisingly similar to drive. Handles very well in the city with great gas mileage. Having purchased a front-wheel drive, a good set of snow tires handled winter driving in the snow well. The highway driving is very good but the engine works harder on hills with 4 passengers and a full load, which is to be expected. Interior noise is surprisingly quiet for a hard working engine as well as very smooth handling. Recommend this vehicle with anyone with kids.Trunk space is a minimum</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Low noise interior, Good road handling in all weather conditions. Recommend 5speed with a 4 cylinder. Excellent city driving & good highway driving. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car last week when my 90 Civic gave up the ghost. My wife and I are just married and we wanted a car we could take the future family and dog camping in. Plus it will be fun for our active/cycling lifestyle. I can fit a tandem bike in it with all the seats down! It was also important as this would be a family car that it have good safety features, it does! My wife has a 07 Sonata and we love its safety and quality which, is why we considered getting another Hyundai. And it rides so very smooth on my 40 mile daily commute. It was priced so competitively that we came in under budget, which makes up for the lower MPG. I can live with that now that I have a little more power-v6</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>High view of the road, cargo capacity, leather steering wheel, leather heated seats, good visibility, phenomenal safety features, rims are standard, fun to drive and a nice 6 disk stereo.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Drove a 6cyl then a 4 cyl and there was very little difference in performance. Car has good space inside, controls and features great. I appreciate the safety stuff like traction and stability control and all the airbags. First weekend cruise got 24+ mpg, mixed bag intown and freeway at 75+. Will update in the future. Like to see more cubby holes for things like cel phone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We live in the "outback" of New Mexico, a mix of bad paved roads and dirt. I've owned a 4-Runner, a Tundra, a Subaru and a mix of Detroit bummers, this small SUV is at the top of the list. We got about 27mpg in the Subaru along with a tough ride. We get a great ride in the Tundra, but truck mileage. In the Hyundai we get 30 on the highway and a Tundra ride. (and a Tundra sound system, AM/FM/CD/Cassette.) I hope this one is as long lasting as a Toyota 'cause we intend to keep it as our main ride. I've read the comments about "ungainly ride" but that isn't my experience at all. In fact this one rides as well as the Tundra which is like a limo. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride, gas mileage, power (V-6, Auto) which outperforms our '01 Outback, comfort, good seats, room, and a quiet ride which I expect will improve once I replace the Bridgstones with Michelins. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned this little SUV for 15 months now, with nary a service problem or defect. I test drove a RAV4, VUE, Escape, and the CRV; I needed a vehicle that could easily tote my daughter's everyday wheelchair and a sport wheelchair. This SUV is roomy (can hold her everyday wheelchair in the back or two medium dog crates w/o putting the rear seat down), is great fun to drive, and the turning radius is good (better than Mazda MPV, about the same as a Camry, not as good as a Volvo or BMW sedan). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The rear seat folds down flat;there is a tray to hold tools or other items over the spare tire that frees up space in the glovebox;</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far, I like the general conservative styling of the vehicle. I have the black interior which gets rid of a lot of the tackiness and cheap feel. Audio is great. Handling is brilliant for a car in its' class. A few blind spots, but otherwise vision is good. Space is well used in car, although question to the depth of the dashboard, could be smaller so that the interior is forward with larger boot. Fuel economy and engine performance is rubbish. Thus far have got no where near what the dealer claimed, transmission is horrible, it needs 5 gears with better ratios, and it loves a drink. You watch the fuel gauge more than the road. Don't get this if you want an economical car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The comfort of the seats, as I am about 175cm high, and 75 kgs, it fits me well, all controls are well placed and easy to reach, room is pretty good considering it is not a huge car, handles really well surprising for a vehicle of its' price, style, and size.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I decided I no longer needed a pickup, I looked at RAV4 and CRV, but chose the Hyundai because of price and warranty. I no longer consider American-made cars. The Tucson is roomy, comfortable, handles well, and has great visibility. The 4c engine seems noisy and underpowered to me compared to my wife's 4c Accord, but I no longer need those features. I did expect better gas mileage than 24 mpg, but that may improve. One bad feature is the light-colored interior, which is hard to keep clean. Did not think of that when I bought. I always felt that home carpets and car interiors should be a dark color, as people tend to walk on them. Seatcovers and mats help.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>handles well, turns well, good visibility, comfortable adjustable seats, good sound system, nice clean exterior lines, folding rear seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Although I have had it for a few weeks I love this ride! My previous relationship was a Hyundai (Elantra) and that alone convinced me that this was a firm purchase and solid vehicle. I love the way it handles and the space on the inside. Any compact car owner could transition comfortably into this vehicle. I am trying to convince my husband to get the Santa Fe which is the 2nd gen of the Tucson. I am totally in love with this vehicle!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth ride, corners like on rails, right size for family of 5</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great car, great price, room galore. Quite, solid ride. My insurance went down $240 a year because of the safety features. Traded in my 2007 Patriot with no regrets. Tucson has larger storage area, more comfortable seats and sits higher. Very good mileage for this type of vehicle in a 4 cyl. A 4x4 will use more gas. 6 cyl,not worth the trade off for the difference in horsepower and mileage. Trailer hitch can tow small loads from the home centers. It is a heavy vehicle, with the front wheel drive, 4 wheel isn't needed if you're not an offroader. Quieter then the Rav4. Switched to synthetic oil increased mileage slightly. Still breaking in average about 24.4 mpg on hwy. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Like the leather seats,locking glove compartment, opening rear window, minimal road noise, great sound system, six air bags,ESC</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Quality interior & creature comforts sold me on this as well as a solid ride, not jittery like the Honda. Very well thought out! Front seat folds flat, several plugs for accessories such as dvd player, plenty of cubby holes, 6 cup holders, storage nets on back of both front seats. 4 adjustments for driver seat-very comfortable for a bad back. Great ride & handles nicely with tight turning radius. High quality materials. Very quiet & little windnoise. Very deceiving on power, feels like it is slower than it really is, power is adequate, about the same as a Ford Ranger & does great on the hills with it smooth shifting tranny. Can manual shift. Excellent mileage, 27 mpg in town.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride, quiet, interior cubby holes, quality. Handling, smooth shifting and excellent MPG. Seats fold flat. Warranty.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just got my Tuscon and love it so far. I have heard complaints about the mileage, but my only problem I have with that is, I want to drive mine everywhere, even if I have no where to go, because it is very nice to drive so if i am using more gas it is because I am driving more.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The way it drives, also love my color Alpine-Frost</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I absolutely love the way my new SUV handles. The gas is pretty good on highway, 28 and 22 around town. Not too shabby. It's extremely comfortable and very roomy. It offers a lot for the price. Tinted windows in the back, the seats fold down and the window in the way back can open with out opening the hatch back. I don't really have any dislikes. The only thing that I wish I could have gotten is four wheel drive. The warranty is Fantastic.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior color is absolutely beautiful, it's a Alpine Frost. I love the fact that it's a standard, 5 speed. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>1. During the week of April 1, I discovered the car was producing a bumpy ruff, roller coaster ride; tossing me up and down, back and forth and side to side. The seat was not absorbing the shock nor was it adjusting for my comfort. Then came the shocker: the car's right back wheel seemed to slide to the right, bumped, then righted itself. I was instantly knocked to the right and then back to center. This action takes less than a second and seems to happen on an uneven indentation, ridge or something in the road. This happens out of the blue and I do not feel safe. I notified Robert Lawson of my unhappiness with the seat and the ruff ride. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>There are many things I like about the Tucson. The dash board is well lit up and large enough to read the information. The mirrors on the side of the car and in the center give an excellent view of cars behind and at the side. No blind spots. Alpine Frost color is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just got my Tucson a few days ago, but I love it. It is affordable, has a smooth ride and is very, very spacious on the inside. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a SUV but cannot afford to get a Benz, BMW or Cadillac. So get one and enjoy it....</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cup holders, spacious seating area and CD player. Oh and I love the color of my Tucson</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is awesome! I never thought I would own a Hyundai and was persuaded to test drive this by my girlfriend and am soooo glad I did. I love the styling, comfort, value and incredibly smooth ride. I test drove just about every small SUV and this was the clear winner! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been wanting an SUV for 5 years and been planning on buying one for the past year. I did a LOT of research. The Tucson Limited has not disappointed me. I've almost hit 3000 miles on it after owning it less than 2 months. It's been on several day long road trips and did wonderful. My only real complaint is one I already knew about and applies to any SUV and that is the mileage. I'm averaging about 20mpg which is a combo of hwy/city driving. On the interstate it averages about 23mpg. I actually expected it to do less so I'm pleased. I am really enjoying driving this car. It rides smooth. Has good acceleration. Mine is fully loaded.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the color (alpine frost), heated seats, placement of steering wheel, sun roof, blue tooth, smooth handling, warranty. I could go on and on.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I never thought in a million years that I would buy an SUV. I was considering a small car, like a Yaris for fuel economy, but when I actually took these little cars for a test drive, the novelty soon wore off! They just didn't seem safe to me. Sitting in the driver's seat of the Hyundai was a wonderful experience. I came for the value, and stayed for the seat warmer! The gas mileage listed is the same as my old Impala in the city, so I didn't lose there! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the Aqua Silver paint, and the good quality. I don't need exciting, I need functional, durable and reliable. You can't go wrong with this warranty!</FAVORITE>
