<TEXT>Bought this truck new on New Year's Eve 2008. After 7 months and 12k miles, I'm a bit disappointed with the mileage. We're only getting around 17 MPG. I have a lead foot, but my wife doesn't and she is the primary driver. Don't see how other reviewers are getting 20+. Have also had to take it to the dealer twice for brake issues. Covered under warranty, but still a hassle. Interior is laid out nicely, but materials seem really cheap. Driver's seat has great leg and head room, but comfort of seat is lacking on long trips. Overall, pretty happy with it. Has a very good ride even at 75-85 MPH. With 3rd row seats out, cargo area is spacious. Can't use NAV without radio on.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a very well engineered vehicle. In 9 months I have driven over 27,000 miles in both city and highway driving, as well as a short 300 mile trip towing a medium size Uhaul. Very comfortable on the road and around town. For a 5,600 lb. SUV with 4WD I can't complain getting 18.5 MPG pulling a trailer at 80 MPH and 19.5 MPG on the open road at 85 MPH. Around town I average 20 MPG and I don't drive like a little old lady. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet, smooth, good acceleration, plenty of towing power, XM, On-Star, Navigation, DVD, comfortable seats, great looks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>bought the 2008 Yukon used in 2009 with only 1500 mile on it. What a truck! Averaging around 21.7 and I have a prtty heavy foot. Very Happy with the truck, getting better gas milage than my BMW x3 with a weak six cylinder.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an amazing truck that has all of the "eco-modifcations" commonly discussed for trucks: aerodynamic styling, light weight engine / body parts, hybrid drive train. The result has been about 23 mpg in overall mileage in a 2WD truck that is fun to drive and easy to operate. Highly recommended to those who need and appreciate large trucks. There is simply nothing else like this truck in its size/weight class.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Remote engine starting from key fob, nav system, backup camera, power folding outside mirrors, on-star cell phone with turn-by-turn nav service, air compressor to inflate tires</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you are considering this vehicle for the gas mileage, forego the Hybrid and purchase a regular Yukon. Based upon the advertising, I thought that it would be worth spending the extra money for the mpg. It's not. Driving under normal conditions (acceleration and braking), I am averaging just 16 mpg, or less. The sticker on the vehicle said EPA Estimate of 20 City/20 Hwy (However, the fine print says "16-24 depending upon driving conditions" (paraphrasing), which give GM a great deal of flexibility, while disappointing the buyer! GM's Hybrid technology is questionable, to say the least. They want you to drive slower than the rest of traffic on start-ups, and brake slower than normal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Other than the gas mileage, my wife and I love the vehicle. It rides nice, is quiet, and appears to be well built. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned this car for about a month and just love it. It is quiet, comfortable, and great to drive. I am averaging about 18mpg. The nav is great and the back up camera comes in very handy. There is a ton of room in this vehicle and it is a pleasure to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We recently bought our Yukon Hybrid as a demo model, so got a great deal (GM Certified used vehicle - 41,000 miles left on bumper-to-bumper warranty). I averaged 23.7 mpg on 400 mile trip home from dealership, driving 65-70 mph on interstates. Am now averaging 24.5 mpg combined city/highway driving in my local area. The hybrid system, and instant economy display really encourage you to drive light-footed, and I have never been light-footed until now. It is a hoot to drive - the hybrid system is virutally seamless in transition, and the V8/V4 cylinder deactivation system works really well. As an added bonus, you can sneak up on your friends and neighbors up to 30 mph, like a big golf cart..</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The hybrid system, and how well it works</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As a former Ford Expedition Loyalist, I was getting tired and broke waiting for Ford to come out with a SUV Hybrid. I drive back and forth to San Diego from Las Vegas two to three times a month. I bought this car last weekend because of the employee pricing, that did away with the proclaimed ROI that all the web sites said for the price make sense. Wow, what a car! I put over 400 miles on it in town, which would have equated with two tanks in my Expedition. When I did fill it up it was 15.00 cheaper than my Expedition. Right there is a 100 savings in just the first week. The vehicle looks great. The vehicle drives like a dream. Haven't taken it over to SD yet but I'm sure it'll be great</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage, comfort, looks! The car is really quiet.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a vehicle to say the least and fun to drive. I can manipulate the truck to pretty much run electric only around the neighborhood. Or "stealth mood" as we have nicknamed it. Love the truck! I have owned 8 new Surburbans. I fully recommend the vehicle, awesome to say the least </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hybrid, nav system, sun roof, back up camera, DVD, Bose sound all awesome</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this truck with a promise of 21 mpg (city and hway). In real life, the best case scenario was 13.8 mpg in town and 16.8 mpg hwy. I drove with a feather touch, and watched the economy meter regularly. On the hwy, I only used Cruise control for maximum gas mileage. With all my attempts, these are the best numbers I could do. I was so upset (and embarrassed when asked by friends what my mileage was on my new Yukon hybrid), that I sold it at a huge loss. Better to get it off my back now than later. It'll be worthless in a year, if they even still make it by then. Interior is all molded plastic... Terrible. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I own a paper recycling company and my customer base is very environmentally conscious. My new Yukon Hybrid fits our company image perfectly. I now own 2 Cadillac Escalades that average 12 MPG. I have averaged 21.7 MPG over the last 3,000 miles with my new Yukon Hybrid. I love my vehicle! The car cost me $20,000 less than my Escalades and is both quieter and handles better. I plan on purchasing two more for my company as soon as the leases are up on the Escalades. A great job by GM!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ergonomics, suspension and quiet ride. I love the Hybrid decals on my exterior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After having owned the Yukon Hybrid for about a week, I have found the Yukon fun and easy to drive with excellent gas economy. The hybrid takes some getting used to--it sounds like a golf cart when starting out. After considerable research, we replaced a 4WD Tahoe and the difference in the mileage is startling and pleasing. We anticipate the difference between the conventional and hybrid will be obliterated in three years or less because of the gas. The interior is comfortable although the seats are harder than the older Tahoe. We took out the 3rd row of seats (not getting them was not an option)for more storage on trips. Overall, an excellent vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet ride, good mileage, spacious interior, good towing capability, fuel management and hybrid features work flawlessly</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only been driving the Yukon Hybrid for about two weeks now, and I must say bravo for GM. It's so quiet, you barely hear it coming. The hybrid drive shift's so smooth you cant feel it shift.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Standard DVD based navigation system, and back-up camera. Heated seats, 4WD.</FAVORITE>
