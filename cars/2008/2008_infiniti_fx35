<TEXT>Started with an I30 then a 2005 G35x then 2008 G35x, now the FX35. Handles much like the G35's and not really much difference in gas mileage. Love the look, the feel and handling. You do get used to the limited rear visibility, really you do. It corners and accelerates well. Very comfortable at all speeds. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The look and comfort. Lots of fun to drive, city and highway. Seats are super comfortable. You feel safe in this car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My husband needed a new car, so I did my homework and found the FX35. I loved the shape and appearance of the car, it's a strong sharp looking car. We test drove the Nissan Murano, but the feel was different than the FX, I like the fact that the FX iss a rear wheel drive. Now... I drive the car every day & my husband drives the 2nd car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the color of my car... Blue Rear backup camera</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle has lived up to our expectations. The car continues to be a treat to drive, to look at and own. A year later, and I still enjoy looking at it and seeing other FXs on the road. It has a very solid ride, and is surprisingly responsive. We love every detail and the vehicle in general. We are sold on the Infiniti line!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Recently purchased the FX35 2008 after repeatedly admiring it's aggressive exterior on the road time and again. The car is everything it's penned to be. The equivalent of a G35 with an SUV exterior. Acceleration is responsive and immediate, addition of iPod connectivity is nice (although not perfect). The luxury features are impressive (bluetooth, NAV, XM satellite radio). Gas mileage is a little weak (I'm averaging in the high teens/low 20's), but that is somewhat expected with the V6 275 HP. The BOSE sound system is fun to listen to, and all-in-all, I am quite satisfied with the FX. A definite recommend!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior shape (unique, and so ugly it's beautiful!). Tech features are plentiful. Rear view camera is a nice addition. iPod connectivity is nice (although not perfect).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've admired this car for years and finally bought one. Now I wish I had bought it years earlier. I have a 2008 with everything except DVD (No Kids). When I am on the road and in traffic I feel superior to everything including the Range Rover Sport and BMW X5. The only other car that I have driven that is even close to "fun" performance is the BMW X5 4.8, even then BMW just has power and cost substantially more. The Infiniti has a sports car feel. I'm still amazed today at how much it feels like a car rather than SUV. When you buy the car, don't settle for standard, get the full package! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I loved this great looking vehicle on the road! Loved it, loved it, loved it! Until I purchased it! I was very disappointed the very first day! I could feel every tiny bump on the road, the steering wheel is very tight, therefore it's not very easy to maneuver. I also couldn't adjust the seat into a comfortable position, and was suffering from the back pain until I got used to it. I am 5,6" and I guess this car is not for shorties. Moms, beware! The metal anchors are so deep, it took me about 20 minutes to install the car seat! Right now I got used to the car, love all other features: Bluetooth, tech pack, back-up camera and keyless entry, but will be looking for another one soon. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth, tech pack, back-up camera, keyless entry, my 2 year old loves DVD! Love the interior and exterior! Mileage is not that bad! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchase on 9/08 a FX 35 with 42 miles. Three months later the check engine light turns on and has problems starting, the mileage at this time was 4800 miles. After 2 weeks at the dealer they told that the camshaft went out. Very dissatisfied with this Infiniti. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Over the years I've owned a wide variety of cars including Porsches, BMWs, a 350Z, and a G35. I must admit that I was concerned that the FX was all show. It looked too sporty to be a true performer. I finally test drove one after a disappointing test drive in the Lexus RX350. I was immediately impressed. The vehicle has the tight and substantial feel very similar to the Porsche. The front fenders even have the same sloping bulge as viewed from the drivers seat. You truly have the feeling that you are in a serious performer, and it doesn't disappoint on the road. If you like driving excitement, this one delivers. Again, I've owned many performance vehicles and the FX holds its own among them.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The overall feeling that this is a strong, well-tuned, and well built vehicle. That it performs as well as it looks. I consider it more of a solid sports car that has ample storage and seats 4 comfortably. For an SUV, Great SUV gas mileage. I'm averaging 21 MPG with combined highway and city driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am in my second FX35 and really enjoy driving my 2008 model. My first FX 35 was a 2005 model with sport and touring packages. I found this to be the most comfortable, fun, and stylish car I've ever had and I've owned several luxury and sports cars. I test drove many crossovers and SUVs and felt the most comfortable being a big guy when I climbed back into my 2005 FX 35. If you want a stylish and fun car to drive check out the FX35.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car yesterday late afternoon in Houston and drove it home 350 miles immediately there after. We own a BMW 325 I which is my wife's car. I wanted an X5. I can tell you after this drive that I regret nothing!!! This is a supreme and finely balanced machine and is not even the top of the line. The sound system is second to none and kept me entertained the whole route. I checked out a MDX, Acadia, X5, X3 and this puppy is a breed above. The local dealer test drive doesn't tell you the whole story. Wow!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love this FX35! This replaced the Volvo XC90 as I have safety, stored the Carrera as I have the power, performance and fun, gave the MDX to hubby, as I have the comfort, style and loaded features all in one car!! Handles like a dream, very comfy, beautiful as all get out! Love all the bells and whistles moreover the price.. not bad. Wish MPG was better however I won't compromise its performance. I wish I can keep this car a secret but people are catching on! This is the sports package of a BMW M for SUVs with the safety rep of a Volvo for us soccer moms! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been thinking about a FX-35 for 5 years. I always thought that the mileage would be too poor for me to consider. Love a sporty driver that is practical - which defines an FX. Wanted something bigger than my 07 VW-GTI. Drove the BMW X6- nice but small, heavy, overpriced and lacks the fun to drive factor Love the FXs comfort, size, quality, sporty drive, high end finishes, feel of the wheel and those seats. Big side mirrors enhance side visibility - with backup camera, I can park easily. Haven't been this thrilled with a car since I bought my 92 Legend couple new. If you don't put your foot into it, you can do OK with gas consumption</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had this vehicle for a month now and love the look of it, love the way it drives, and love the respect I get on the road. I was most worried about the visibility b/c I read the vehicle has a lot of blind spots, turns out the mirrors are pretty good about compensating. My one main issue is a personal one - I am 5'5" and having a hard time getting the right fit in the vehicle - I end up with knees dangerously close to dash in order to reach the pedals and see well through the windshield at the same time. If I move the seat lower, the seatbelt is on my neck, if I move it farther back, I can't reach the gas pedal as well. I think it would be hard to find a good comfort level for shorties.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Infiniti FX35 combines the performance of a high performance sports car and the versatility of an SUV. The 2008 model is sleeker and more high-tech inside. Its performance, luxury and technology equals a lot of fun to drive! Highly recommend it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I use my FX35 as a daily driver and my vette on the weekends. The FX has pep, performance, looks, handling,and a nice balance between fun and function. With the high gas prices I've been using regular and don't notice any change in performance. I get 19 mpg in city/highway driving. The vehicle is a 'headturner' since I don't see a lot where I live. The 6 cylinder is lively with a smooth 5 speed auto tranny. Styling is unique and built with quality in Japan. It is responsive whether driving aggressively or just as a normal commuter. You don't need a lot of options. I would skip the costly tech package but definitely get the sport package for performance and better personalize the exterior looks.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the adjustable driver dash pod with excellent power driver and passenger seats. Nice touch with the window washer located on the wiper blade. Very unique and effective. Nice throaty sound to the dual exhauts. Nicely set for the audio/heat cooling functions.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Disappointed</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>With 8500 miles the FX looks like a keeper even though some of the techy stuff is frustrating. If the cruise is on and you are in a bend it will pick up cars in other lanes and stomp the brakes for you so you really have to watch where you have the cruise on. Bluetooth phone is garbage. Also the black chrome grill is all peeling off and Infiniti says they will change it once as "good faith" but it's my fault and not a supplier defect.</TEXT>

<TEXT>One month in. No complaints. Everything it is built to be. Handling is heavy and stiff yet nimble. Great ride with spot package. Turns on a dime with decent radius. Great 30-60 pickup. As noted, it is thirsty, but know what you're buying. This isn't a Prius. Interior is sharp and sophisticated. It really only compares to MDX, CX7, LR2 and Lexus RX. And there is stand apart. Car should still look great 10 years from now. Well ahead of its time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style in general. Fit and finish. Good stereo and nice electronics. Expect great reliability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>t's the nicest looking SUV out there, it's a blast to drive, and even the bare bones model comes with everything I need. The interior is wonderfully simple, the seats are very comfortable, the stereo is loud, and the engine really sounds sweet. It does accept regular fuel, a lot of it, but performance seems to be a bit better using the recommended premium. Acceleration is smooth and reasonably brisk, and steering is firm and sporty. I think it's a great value for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The simple interior is perfect. Roomy, no wood trim, fantastic seats, it's very classy. The exterior styling is still a head turner, no doubt enhanced by the fact that there are so few of these where I live. With the exception of the mileage it's just magnificent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm 33 and I bought this car this summer have 12k driven already loaded with 20" rims every option. I beat on this car and its handling is great, just like a sports car, my customers and friends love the truck. Back seat very comfortable. I like the heavy weight and agility, suspension, sound of the exhaust. The roof rack helped with adding a snow board rack. I will lease this same car when my lease is up in 21 months and thinking of giving up my porsche boxster.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great - snow mode reduces wheel spin and power, lane departure mode and cruise control good for late night driving. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Was in the market for a new car and I was contemplating between BMW, Lexus, Audi and Infiniti. I am glad with my decision after driving FX35, just a bit bad in the economy department. Hurts when I'm filling up the tank but the moment I start to drive its all good, puts a smile on my face everytime I pull away from others and it's real head turner. Technically it's good in almost every department.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The FX35 AWD is an awesome vehicle. The sport suspension is firm, but nowhere unbearable. The FX handles like a dream. Steering is precise and provides excellent feedback. I like the 350Z's smaller thick leather steering wheel in the FX. The interior quality has improved drastically from the early 2003-2005 models. Plastic and leather are MUCH softer. I have driven the GX, RX, X5, XC90, ML, GL and Cayenne. The best overall value in the midsize crossover is the FX. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>20" wheels with the Sport Package. Much better looking than the 18's. Improved leather seats, bluetooth, AWD traction, handling - best handling crossover period.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The FX35 has everything you could ever want standard. It really does give you the feeling of driving a sports car. There are only 5 FXs in our town (each a different color) - makes you feel very exclusive. I keep getting comments from strangers about how sharp looking it is and this is a 5 year old body style! I'm very happy I decided to drive 90 miles. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling, great handling and as much power as anyone will ever need. The standard backup camera makes parking a breeze. The standard XM radio is great. It holds a lot more than I thought it would. We were able to put luggage for 3 people (2 wk.trip) in the back with room to spare. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I needed more room and had to give up the convertible. I was really surprised when I test-drove this car and fell in love with it. The FX35 has a great sporty look. It handles as well as my 2005 BMW 330 CiC (with sport pkg). I really enjoy driving it. I have almost all the options - sport pkg, touring, handsfree, (except DVD player). It's very luxurious on the inside; I haven't given up anything. I can't imagine driving anything else.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a confessed carnut and I think this is a great SUV. I've had a Porsche Cayenne S, BMW X5 and Lincoln SUVs prior and I think that this one is the most comfortable and certainly the best value for the dollar. I traded in a BMW 745i and as great as that car was, there is a lot to love about this car! Sporty, fun to drive, logical controls, very comfortable seats (I'm 6'5 and that is always a concern), and usable options instead of gadgets just to have gadgets! I would say luxurious as well. I got the sport package and did not notice the ride vs the non sport which I test drove as well. The 20" wheels/tires look awesome as well as the other sport trim items that are part of the package.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable seats, and seating position, fun to drive, back up camera, smart key ignition, bluetooth cell phone connection, sharp exterior and interior looks, Bose 300 wattt stereo with 11 speakers & CD! Push button fold down rear seats, large chrome dual exhausts.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Great Value</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Purchased car new based on analysis among Lexus RX, Acura MDX, and Toyota Highlander (replaced RX). By far a better value - great handling especially in windy road conditions - tons of standard features - options are reasonably priced relative to competition. Driving comfort is second to none. Back up camera is great feature as there is a blind spot in changing lanes looking out the rear sides. Car is quieter than anticipated - on screen displays easy to use and make sense. Best of all - can fit 3 sets of golf clubs in rear much like the RX - so many SUVs today cannot fit golf clubs in the rear compartment without putting the seats down. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling (like a true sports car) - seat comfort - rear view camera - on board computer - great engine - best on market for smooth-quick acceleration.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I both were amazed at how this SUV handled. Coming from a BMW 3-series coupe and my wife from a Subaru WRX turbo wagon, the FX handled turns like it was on rails. My brother has the X5 and it's on par with it. The 3.5 engine is adequate but if you want a rocket get the 45 instead. Fit and finish the vehicle is perfect. All the amenities for the price makes it all worth it. The comment by the editors about the interior being an elite Nissan, I agree somewhat but it's definitely more appealing than my BMW. Engine is smooth. Suspension and handling are stiff enuff, so the Sport Susp. would be unnecessary IMO. You won't be disappointed with this SUV. Pull the trigger!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has everything I was looking for in a luxury sedan but it is a SUV. I took my time looking for a new car and test drove just about everything on the luxury market. I am about 6'2'' and about 275 pounds. It fits me like a glove. Nothing on the market can compare with the comfort and performance along with the luxury at this price. I purchased the FX35 in early September and have not regretted it one day. It has power, performance, room, luxury, and is still decent on the gas. I am getting right at 20 mpg right now and I am not a real gentle driver. I would recommend this car to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just picked up an FX and I am completely blown away by it. Traded in a G35 coupe for it and thought I would be losing a whole lot of sportiness in return for utility but that is not the case. The FX has great pickup and handles very well for a 4100 lb car. It has ample room for cargo and believe it or not people have asked me about it and commented how sleek it looks. All this makes me feel that I did the right move. I do miss my G coupe but I feel I will have just as much fun in my FX. Anyone who test drives one will end buying it. That is how good it is... period!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I have always preferred sporty vehicles so up until now have resisted purchasing a SUV. The FX is a great blend of a sports car feel with SUV convenience. Handles great in mts. Some reviews complain about the limited storage space but we find it more than adequate for most applications. Some don't like the exhaust sound which we enjoy but if it bothers you, simply turn up the fabulous Bose sound system. We were concerned about possible gas mileage issues but are getting almost 24 mpg on highway and close to 20 mpg in town. Over years we have owned a lot of vehicles but we feel the FX35 is the best vehicle we have ever owned. Goodbye Mercedes. </TEXT>
