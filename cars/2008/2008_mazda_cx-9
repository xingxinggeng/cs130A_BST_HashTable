<TEXT>...it would be this vehicle. Bought it used but it only had 74 miles on it!! Great Deal!! Traded in my 2000 Ford Explorer w/ a V-8. What a world of difference. This CUV is so much smoother, refined and quiet. Love the handling and power. Took a long distance trip (1000 miles round trip) and it was a perfect combination for passenger and cargo space. Three rows came in handy, plenty of room for the kids. Minor quibbles: CX-9s w/ navigation require separate i-pod module, no automatic locks when rolling, no rear back-up sensors (Explorer had em), no load leveling system, seat cushion slightly short for taller drivers. Other than that, having a tough time keeping it from my wife.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride, handling, power and all around performance. Exterior styling is nice (shape similar to Porsche Cayenne). Comfortable and roomy. Rear seats move fore and aft. Third row roomy enough for me at 6'0".</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Owner for 2 years. Overall very satisfied with this vehicle. Great acceleration and smooth ride. After driving it 1000 miles in 1.5 days, I was surprised that my back didn't hurt. I am very pleased with this car's performance, but can't say the same for the dealership's service. Love the Bluetooth and Nav system. Average hwy mileage at 75mph is 25. In town mileage could be better. Loads of cargo room. Down fall is that no daytime running lights and if you turn headlights on during the day, I can't see the speedometer very well even with my prescription sunglasses.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased my 2008 GT AWD in August of this year w/ 9k miles on it. It replaced our 2006 Chrysler T&C Van. My wife absolutely loves the CX9. I drive a 05 Audi A4 Quattro w/ sport pkge and I am amazed at how well the Mazda handles and drives for a larger heavier vehicle. If you need 3 rows of seats and don't have to have sliding doors, then make sure you drive one of these before purchasing anything else. We test drove 10 different crossovers and SUV's and kept going back to the Mazda. I also drove the Touring model. The GT does not ride that much firmer for how much better it handles and looks. Love the sliding 2nd row for entry/exit and the legroom. Ours is loaded and we love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did a lot of research before purchasing the 08 CX9. Looked at Acura, Lexus, Volvo and Cadi. The X9 is by far the best. I can't believe there a not more of these on the road. I have never owned a Mazda before but if this continues to meet my standards I will buy another. Handling excellent! Style Awesome! Get up and go, yes! I get a lot of looks with this car. I bought it for my wife but I want to drive it too. I traded in a Cadi SRX and this is much better. Great car, you won't be disappointed!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design is great and comfortable seats. Car feels a lot bigger inside than it is. according to the specs is only 2 inches longer than my SRX but it just has more room. Well Done Mazda</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased a new 2008 Mazda CX9 for my wife in Feb 2009. We were impressed by the look and ride of the car. We were blown away by the fuel economy of our car. We were expecting less than 20 miles per gallon. We are getting 22 to 23 miles per gallon. Our only sore spots with the car are the hood latch that broke very easily and the third row seat belt hooks that feld off while driving around town. Due to the great car's ride and comfort, those flaw are very minor in comparison. We will recommend and have recommend buying the CX9 to our friends and family. The power will blow you away. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are the comfortable ride, power of the engine, the blind spot monitoring device and the head and leg room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This luxury crossover needs to be taken more seriously. Perhaps with maybe a Lexus badge... The problem is, it is designed so well that the big doors are effortless to open and close. But passengers think it's a truck door... and swing it open with brute force (straining the door stops), and slams the door when they leave! One of them even swung the door right into a shopping cart return cage when I deliberately parked there to avoid other cars opening their doors to it! People just don't realize this is a luxury level crossover. Fuel economy, power and sporty handling is remarkable for something this heavy. I love the car! No complaints, except my passengers!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Excellent drivetrain, fun in the snow (with winter tires), fun on pavement. This car does have Zoom Zoom, especially for a 4500 pound wagon. Everything about the car is good, except for the coolant leak that has presented odor in the car (while in traffic especially) with no visible signs elsewhere. The regional service mgr. refuses to step up and acknowledge / fix the car, with empty statements of 'protocol', Mazda almost has a winner with its flagship automobile. I really like driving the car, just the annoyance is enough to steer towards another make next time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this new a year ago. Driven it to California and back (Dallas). Really enjoy the drive, interior room, fuel mileage, nav system, and performance. Engine performs nicely. Rear entertainment system is nice: kids really like it. Powered rear door/hatch is really handy. A/C is powerful. 3rd row seats are split, and easy to bring up and put down. This is our first Mazda and we're really impressed with this vehicle. I've hit speeds up to 85mph and the CX9 handled well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine is a solid performer. Corners well, more car-like than my 2007 4Runner. The 6-speed transmission is smooth. Gadgetry is well-placed. Gauges are colorful at night and easy to see. Audio system is decent...not quite as good as the upgraded JBL in my 4Runner.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having driven this vehicle for almost a year, I have to say this is the most sporty, comfortable, stylish and roomy SUV I've owned. It has plenty of room for car seats and soccer equipment as well. It is like driving a luxury vehicle at a reasonable price. It is packed with features. The blind-spot monitoring is fantastic. Thought it would be a bother, now its a must. It has plenty of power and can go 375 miles on one tank. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased the car on a comparison review of the Highlander,the Pilot and the CX- 9. There are only 2 baby clips available in the 2nd seat. You can not put a baby seat in the middle (it folds down). I put my 1st baby seat on the smallest section and then could not fold down the larger section to get into the 3rd seat. (I needed to place 3 car seats in the car) In the comparison they did point out the negative about the rear passenger doors being longer and more difficult to open it tight situations. I have found that it is more difficult in most situations. The road noise is terrible. There are multiple blind spots and the drivers seat is very uncomfortable</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned this 2008 car--a loaded AWD GT for a month and a half but have only driven 1,000 miles so far. We LOVE this car--rides better than our 2004 Audi Allroad but there are a few missing elements that should be available on a car at this price. The interior is very nice in beige. Adjustable Xenon headlights are good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After test driving everything in the market, including Lexus, we decided on CX-9. It is amazing how well it handles... quiet, looks great, easily tows my entire family and two more friends with room in back for golf clubs. The problem is the nav... not cheap, but it's maps are 4-5 years out of date! Am told new DVD in fall 08 that we will have to pay for... ridiculous! Why didn't Mazda let us know? We would have waited. Bad experience with Mazda as I tried to get answers.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD (makes huge diff in rain going around turns on slick road), Bluetooth, build quality (solid and quiet), Bose surround sound stereo system, easy access to third row, remote trunk raise, slick design (gets a lot of praise, can't tell 3 rows from outside, but plenty big inside), feels much smaller.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my CX-9 touring AWD for 1 month and look forward to driving it everyday. So far my only regret is not buying the grand touring for a few more dollars. The ride is great, yet I still feel connected to the road. The factory tires are not the best for slick pavement or ice, but seem better after having them siped.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a Realtor and I drive a lot of miles for work, to the tune of 25K-30K a year. I got rid of an 06 BMW M5 for my Mazda for practical reasons. I?ve had too many friends with the X5 that had many problems with a whole laundry list of stuff. I don?t care for the way the Acuras or Toyotas look. So for me it was between the VW, Mazda CX-9 and Audi. The Mazda was in there because I have all car magazines coming to the house and I had read that the Mazda was truly something. And it looks incredible. So, I went and drove them all and the Mazda was truly all by it?s self. The Audi and VW had quicker 0-60 times but the handling of the Mazda made you forget about its 4300lbs. the other did not.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased as 3rd car to go with a Porsche 911. I've always driven nothing but European sports cars, but am VERY impressed with this car. Steering is excellent for any vehicle. Handling is good for a car this big, but Mazda really needs to address the torque steer under hard acceleration in FWD models. It isn't fast, but quick enough for what it is. The interior is tasteful and well done. A few cheap plastic bits, but what do you expect at this price? This car looks and performs like a $45K car, and can be had nicely optioned for $35K. A steal at this price, it drives as well as some competitors costing $20K more. Perfect as kid carrier or a sporty SUV- - can do both well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been considering an SUV for quite some time but having driven sports cars and sports sedans all my life I wasn't quite happy with anything out there. When I finally got serious about looking last year I considered just about everything on the market from the Isuzu to the Lexus. I was surprised to find Mazda had an entry large enough for my needs and pleased to find the array of options and accessories to match up with almost any of the others. After a month and a half and 2500 miles, I'm happier with my choice than when I first got it. I would recommend anyone looking for a mid to large size SUV look into this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I compared Highlander, Outlook/Acadia/Enclave, Veracruz, and the CX-9. They all were very well designed, spacious CUVs, but the CX-9 was the only vehicle that was exciting to look at and fun to drive. I have had my CX-9 for 3 weeks and driven about 700 miles. The CX-9 is a very spacious, practical vehicle, and it is about as close to driving a sport sedan as a CUV can get. The Grand Touring 20" wheels do ride slighly stiffer than the 18" wheels on the Touring, but I don't find it objectionable. The interior is quiet at cruise, but you can still hear the engine growl under acceleration. Handling seems nimble for such a large vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving 9 other 7 passenger SUV/CUVs to replace our jeep after the birth of our twins, the CX9 easily came out on top. It is remarkable how they make a vehicle of this size drive as small as it does. Mazda really thought this one through before putting it out there, unlike most others that put the third row in as an after-thought.</TEXT>

Although the car seems to be more mechanically sound then the RX-8, after 2 months it had a body seam rupture without any apparent cause.

<TEXT>This purchase was for my wife. She was a minivan driver and I have always liked sport sedans. We were both ready to leave our minivan of seven years, but with 3 growing children ages 5 to 12, we needed to maintain 3 rows and 7 passenger capability. Since we have owned 2 previous Mazdas (I currently own the MZ3S) we were very excited about the CX-9. The CX-7 was nice but too small for our needs. This CX-9 fit our needs perfectly. Although a fairly large vehicle at about 200" long and almost 5,0000 lbs, it drives like a sporty sedan on steroids. Acceleration is brisk and the ride is fairly smooth. The BSMS helps to minimize blind spots. Overall we are pleased with this vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>273 hp and 6 speed transmission get this vehicle moving quickly and effortlessly. Bose surround for CD & DVD. Blind spot monitoring system (BSMS). Xenon headlights. Nice interior and gauge cluster. Plenty of room in 3rd row for adults.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In deciding on a second car, I did a lot of research over a 6 month period. To be honest, Mazda never even entered the discussion initially until two months ago! Truth be told, in test driving the Toyota Highlander, Lexus RX 330, Honda Pilot and GMC Acadia, the CX-9 had them all beat. The ride was incredible. Power when I needed it and agility when necessary are the atrributes that made the CX-9 stand above the rest in this category. While the review is true about the stiffness with the 20" wheels, it's not as bad as the review potentially paints it. Interior and Exterior stylings are very, very nice! - This car makes people do double takes! (Especially the Grand Touring model!)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wish I had noticed how loud this car was before I purchased. Also, the leather on the seats is not as nice as it could be. The AC seems to smell funny too and my "new car" smell left after only a week : (. I do love the keyless start. I consider it a safety feature because it keeps me from spending minutes in a dark parking lot searching for keys. I didn't get the nav. system but wanted a back-up cam so I had the rearview mirror cam installed and I love it!! The car is growing on me. Love the cargo room when third row is folded down. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, after one week and 1000 miles including a 10.5 hour drive from San Diego we really like this car but there are some unique nuances. Car is extremely fun to drive and definitely has a good presence on the road. We have the all wheel drive version and driving in snowy conditions in Tahoe was not a problem at all, very stable. Car is very comfortable, good electronics, and overall seems a decent value within the category. Nuances are though that the car does not have a fuel range computer (and we have a grand touring with virtually every feature) and does not have a compass or trip computer. Finally the iPod attachment does not work with Sat radio and Navigation - big issue</TEXT>

I spend more than 2 hours in my car commuting every day, and I love my drive time in this car. It is a dream to drive. The seats are terrific, firm and supportive. The interior is sharp and well done, not cheap and plastic like many American made models I've driven. The third row seating is extremely easy to access and the amount of space to get in is more than any other car with a third row. I was skeptical about zoom zoom, but this car made me a believer.

<TEXT>I needed a true 7 seater & CX-9 has a 3rd row seat that can actually seat full grown adults like myself (I'm 5'11") with leg room. Since the second row of seating can be adjusted fore and aft, 3rd row riders can get enough leg room without compromising legroom for the 2nd row of passengers. For those more inclined to enthusiast type of performance, no other SUV in it's class comes close. The CX-9 never feels heavy or ungainly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After three months researching, the CX9 came out on top for comfort, zoom, distinct styling, and of course a non-boring ride. Looked at Lexus, Nissan, GMC, even Volkswagen. Nothing compares, it looks great, gets attention, lots of room, feels much smaller yet solid road feel. Suspension does a great job feeling like it wants to be driven. After two weeks, other cars had some pluses, but the overall package has to work together. Congrats to Mazda for raising an eyebrow of all other manufacturers! They wish they had the chemistry the CX9 has. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We looked at Pilot, Highlander, Volvo C-90, Lexus and others. CX-9 Grand Touring, in my opinion, blew them away. Only have 200 miles on it, so there is still much to learn. It was immediately comfortable and familiar to drive. Very car-like, "zoom-zoom philosophy" is very evident. It is easy and fun to drive, and size is not apparent until it is time to park it, or wash it! Dashboard at night, for gadget-freaks, is like piloting the space shuttle. Nav is to a large degree voice activated, some dealers didn't seem to understand that. I currently own a 6 sp Acura CL- S and find every excuse I can to borrow my wife's CX-9.

After doing my research, the CX9 offered an all around excellent package. It has the space for my family of 5 and is fun to drive; unlike my previous car (Toyota Sienna). If you want a roomy, fun to drive, and aggressively designed SUV the Mazda CX9 is worth a test drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car to replace a Honda Accord which we were sorry to see go but needed AWD. To cut a long story short we tried a number of cars we tried a number of 'smaller' crossovers including a CX-7, and then my wife sat in a CX-9 they had on the lot. 1 hour later we owned it. It was just head and shoulders over anything else we had looked at in terms of quality, performance and out and out 'coolness'. Interior is stunning, well thought out and comfortable. Leg room is generous as is room for cargo. Car is easy to drive and feels a lot smaller than it really is. While it won't break any records on the 1/4 mile it is plenty powerful enough for most situations.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav system, fit and finish and general comfort (my family is all over 6 ft and there plenty of space for knees in the second row). I would STRONGLY recommend getting the backing camera. The rear window is high and there is a big blind spot.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Mazda CX-9 is a much better vehicle than the 2007 Honda Pilot I traded in. There is less road noise, better steering, better stereo, more power and torque. It seems like it should have cost more for all of the features, how it handles and drives compared to the Pilot. The six-speed automatic does not downshift all the time like the Honda's five speed did and shifts perfectly unlike the GM six speeds in their new SUVs which I also looked at. Rear seat is easy to get into and seats are much better than the Pilot.</TEXT>

Interior storage up front and cup holders are a little lacking, the rear doors open wide (pro/con), and the wheels communicate a lot of road imperfections. That said, I love my cx-9. Fun to drive; interior feels very upscale; looks great inside and out. From the outside, you'd never guess the interior space -- seats slide and layout is great. It is huge inside, other than height (though there is plenty of headroom). Got the towing package to use a cargo carrier for keeping trash barrels outside on trips to the dump (this vehicle replaces my pickup).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1) Technology! Smart card key (how did we live before this?); Bluetooth is easy to use - anybody holding their phone to their ear is crazy; nav; back up camera; rain sensing wipers; touch screen audio controls; auto close rear gate. 2) Fun to drive 3) Great looks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Compared this car with the 08 Highlander. We decided on the 08 Mazda CX-9 because of the standard safety features, great quality interior and the very sturdy feel when driving. Plenty of room with standard 7 passenger seating, standard 2nd row air vents, as opposed to the Highlander's optional 7 passenger seating and optional 2nd row air vents. The Bose sound system is a plus! Great exterior design. My children loves the roomy space and the DVD Entertainment. We have discovered the "zoom, zoom, zoom" way of driving and what a feeling, indeed! We recommend this vehicle to anyone shopping for the best of the best! Safety, quality, comfort the zoom, zoom way! The price is just right</TEXT>

<TEXT>Like others, I looked at the Toyota Highlander, Acura MDX, Lexus GX470, Saturn Outlook, and Subaru Tribeca before selecting the CX-9. The exterior styling is fantastic with the stylish lines and those 20" rims. The interior is well laid out and feels like it was designed by people that actually cared about what it would be like to ride in every day. Controls are intuitive which is a nice change from our BMW X5 and Infiniti FX. The Bose stereo also beats the Harmon-Kardon in the bimmer by miles!! The bluetooth took 3 minutes to setup and worked with both mine and my wife's phones. Smooth to drive, plenty of pep, and comfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We are still under 1k miles so I haven't let loose on it however, I can tell it is going to be fun once I do. 30-70 mph acceleration is fantastic. We shopped for months for the perfect car and we feel we got it with the CX-9. Did we need the back up cam and navigation system? Not really, but we really wanted the Blue and it was the only one available. There is plenty of room for us and our new baby. The only downside for me is that the seats are a bit narrow in the front, however, I am 6'4" 290 lbs. This is the first vehicle I don't have to put the seat ALL the way back!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I considered Audi Q7, Acura MDX, 2008 Toyota Highlander, GMC Acadia, etc., but no one can come close to this vehicle in terms of performance, quality and price. This car is 100% built in Japan and proves to be the best of the best available today. This car is a true head turner.

<TEXT>Bought this vehicle brand new from the dealership. The sales rep was extremely knowledgable about this vehicle. I added a remote starter, all weather mats, Lojack and rear cargo mat. The cargo cover cannot be installed due to remote closing gate. Mazda has done a superb job of putting this vehicle together, extensive list of accessories and safety features are standard in this particular model.The car is riding very well (only 200 miles so far!), sound system is unbelievable. The steering response for a crossover suv is excellent. The engine noise and the cabin noise is barely noticeable. Acceleration with the 273 hp engine is more then adequate. So far no complaints.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Picked it up last week. Waited specifically for the 08 and the 3.7 engine, worth the wait for sure. Power really comes on strong now for passing. Perfect blend of utility and performance, blast to drive. Comfort has been excellent so far, no complaints from rear seat passengers, plenty of room all around. Most of the upscale features one would expect for the money. Fit and finish exceptional. More quiet than the Infiniti we just turned back in from lease. Where we live there haven't been many running around on the roads yet, which doesn't bother me at all, who wants to see what you're driving on every corner. Adds a level of exclusivity!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smart Key (nice). Middle row seats adjustable fore and aft and recline, access to the 3rd row is easy. Remote start. Bluetooth works well. Drives like a sports sedan, not an SUV or van. Nice interior design and materials, uplevel feel. Voice command nav, if we can train it to function properly.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought my CX-9 this week. Did extensive search looking at the Acura MDX, Toyota Highlander, Volvo XC90, Honda Odyssey, Honda Pilot, Toyota Sienna. Reasons I picked the CX-9: 1) Good access to third row. Second row seats can slide forward, so you can access the third row without having to move a car seat. 2) Comparable to 2008 Accura MDX in features but costs a lot less, MDX more difficult to get to the third row and dash is very cluttered with different knobs. 3) Comparable to the 2008 Highlander but a better ride. Highlander still has a trucky feel. 4) Decided against the minivans because the new cross-over SUVs offer comparable features and space, without the minivan ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation, Bluetooth, stereo, engine performance and pickup (probably benefited a little from the bigger engine in the 2008), quiet inside (even with the 20s), very plush and comfortable interior and exterior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drive the Saturn Outlook, the new 2008 Highlander, Honda Pilot and the 2007 Acura MDX. The CX-9 was more fun to drive than all of them and still gave me a real third row seat. I took my 22 year old son with me and we both tried getting in and out of the back seats in all of them and the Mazda was the easiest. I found this the ideal car for taking my road bike to the club starting point and hauling 7 family members to dinner and the most fun to drive of all the cars. Economy seems the same as my 1997 Camry V6 so far on the first two tanks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought the vehicle and immediately took it on a LONG trip. A pretty comfortable ride, with lots of room. Some very nice features, and received lots of compliments on the exterior design. Overall we are pleased. Not all is perfect in Zoom Zoom land however. With a load it takes its sweet time passing cars at freeway speeds. Husband sez something about low-end torque...or lack thereof. Mileage about as expected...maybe 22 on open road. Surprisingly not much worse in town. Having to pay extra for satellite radio installation in a vehicle of this price range is disappointing. Radar in rear bumper that detects passing vehicles, (and sometimes nearby guard rails) is a great safety feature. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Mazda CX-9 replaced a Volvo XC-90 in September 2008. We have been very pleased - especially with the V6 performance (note 2008 is larger engine than 2007) and comfortable yet sporty ride (even with 19" wheels) . Nav is very good. Bose stereo is pretty good, but not as good as some other high-end factory audio systems. All weather mats from the factory sit flat on the ground and don't really catch the snow and water very well. Volvo is the king of seat design, and it is too bad that Ford didn't steal more of this technology to give to Mazda. Gas mileage is reasonable for a truck this size. Tons of room.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm loving it ! I had an CX-7 and the turbo was too much for me to handle (turbo lag was omnipresent). I was dreaming about CX-9 since I bought CX- 7 but my wife was not so sure we can handle 40K. Then, I missed more all the options that my Grand Touring Buick LeSabre 2000 was having : rain sensing wipers, day lights, compass in the rearview mirror, trip computer and so on. Missed so much the Buick...and I ended up trading in CX-7 for CX-9. In the first day, I drove in Greater Chicagoland area, 200 miles of fun and joy. I was so happy that I could not believe it. Thank You Mazda, for being number one in my heart. Still...put the towing package for GT. Please.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first Mazda. It is a new 2008 and has slightly less than 1000 miles. So far, we are very pleased with the performance. We are getting about 17.2 mpg with City/highway driving. The third seat is great for the grandchildren. As you would anticipate for a big car, the acceleration is a bit sluggish and the fuel mileage is nothing to brag about. The CX-9 qualifies as a luxury vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I chose among Highlander, Pilot and CX9. Pilot is too ugly for my taste. Highlander is too expensive with ultra-cheap 3rd row and non-splittable. CX9 is the best deal out there. I was worrying about the reliability like most potential buyers would be. No problem for me after 1 year. Mazda service in my area is also superb. Loaners for repairs (TSB, etc.) and major services. The bottom like is that CX9 drives like a BMW X5 with more than $20K saved in your bank.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our second Mazda, having driven a 2008 CX-7 since early 2008, which was a company car. We were so impressed with it, that we decided to buy the CX-9 for it's greater seating and because of excellent consumer reviews to accompany our experience with the CX-7. We couldn't be happier with our purchase. We bought a program car with 18K miles on it for about $21K, with leather seats. Another $600 spent on a DVD player and $200 on GPS saved us about $2-3K for the factory installed versions. We couldn't be more pleased with this vehicle! The ride and comfort is better than the CX-7; it's quieter and feels very luxurious. We'll have this for a long time!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is amazing. As a car nut who has owned just about every type of car imaginable including Audi, BMW etc. - this vehicle has exceeded my expectations in every way. The drivability and sheer practicality of the CX-9 is unmatched. I looked at every crossover and for anyone who enjoys cars - there simply is no comparison if you need the room of a 3 row CUV/SUV. I even owned the new Acura MDX and aside from the Acura's vastly superior navigation system, just about everything else on the CX-9 is better. BTW - I have not had any issues with the 20 inch wheels - the ride is smooth, taut and in no way harsh. The CX-9 simply drives like a nice European vehicle. Highly recommend it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted to wait until I had 15,0000 miles before I wrote this review. I am 55 and buy a new car about every 3 maybe 4 years and have since I was 20. I have always had station wagon, mini van, SUV type vehicles. Owned mainly GM and Ford and I can say without doubt that the CX9 GT is the best vehicle I have bought. It handles beautifully, is so quiet and smooth. No problems of any kind in my first 15K miles. We have taken in the mountains of CO and gone on dirt mt. roads and the FWD was superior to any of my RWD vehicles. This is a roomy fun car to drive and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone. I drove the GMC Acadia and its a nice car but not near as nice as the CX9 GT.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The way it handles, and the quiet smooth ride. The roomy interior is very useful and easy to use. Seats are very comfortable even for my 6'2" legs! The back is more than roomy for tall adults! Bose system is so good you won't want to leave your favorite music.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>1600 miles into our 2008 Touring CX-9, AWD option has already paid for itself in a brutal start to winter, even by Michigan standards. Decided on Touring over Grand Touring because 18 in. wheels/tires produce a much less jittery and more comfy ride than the 20 inchers on our cratered, suburban Detroit roads. The vehicle strikes a wonderful ride comfort/handling balance, providing agility, flat cornering, responsive transmission and steering while not punishing occupants on bad roads. I am surprised by the lack of a mpg computer. While not expecting hybrid-like fuel economy, I am very disappointed by the 12.6 mpg experienced thus far--can only hope this improves as break-in progresses!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fuel mileage is poor. We have taken 2 long trips,one West to Yellowstone, Glacier, Tetons and the Black Hills. 2nd was to East Coast Fall Colors trip At the toll booths one needs to accellerate quickly after paying in order to merge with the other cars and we found that during this hard accelleration the transmission would not up shift beyond 4th gear even with pedal fully released, the only way to up shift was to maive the lever into the manual position then force the up shift manually. We have taken the car in to Morrie's on 2 occasions but was not able to dispaly the problem to the service people. We soon start another long trip and have concerns about the transmission failing </TEXT>

I researched and test drove about every crossover out there and none felt as good to drive as the CX9. The stereo is awesome, especially the surround sound when playing a DVD. Xenon headlights are great. Anyone who has never been in this car before is surprised how nice it is and can't believe it is a Mazda. The handling and performance are second to none in the crossover segment. The transmission is silky smooth. The GPS with back up camera are great features.

<TEXT>We bought this vehicle for my wife, she was looking for a spacious crossover to upgrade from her VW Passat for our 2 active boys. We looked at the Ford Edge, Nissan Murano, and Mazda CX-7. The Edge was just boring to drive, the Murano was our second fav pick, but too pricey and significantly smaller. We were most surprised though about the difference between the CX-7 & the 9. The fit and finish of the 9 seemed significantly better than the 7. Both are fun to drive, the 7 has serious zoom-zoom, but for a bigger vehicle, the 9 does as well. For overall look and utility, the 9 was the hands down winner for us.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a replacement to a totaled Toyota Sienna. *For the segment*, it is probably the best interior space for the exterior dimensions. We looked at a Saturn Outlook, Honda Pilot and Buick Enclave, but the GM's few extra inches in all dimensions made them a chore in parking lots. The Honda sacrificed too much in 3 row. The Mazda was just right. The lack of interior storage is frustrating, with all the room in the center stack wasted under a compartment that barely fits a couple of wallets. A Mazda5 has more interior storage than the CX-9. The handling is excellent, the driver seats far from the front axle and somehow it feels like a substantial sedan on the road.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Compared with Honda Pilot, Acura MDX, Toyota Highlander. I'd not considered the Mazda originally, but when we drove it we loved it. CX-9 clearly offered much more car for the dollar than others in its class. The build quality seems excellent, interior materials are very nice - much better than Honda or Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the exterior and interior styling of this CUV. Performance is really good for such a large vehicle. Acceleration, steering, and braking are all the same or better than my wife's coupe. We took the cx-9 on a 1000 mile trip this summer. We averaged over 22 mpg and this was with 5 people, luggage, and driving through mountains. Not bad for a CUV! We also test drove the new Honda Pilot and GMC Acadia and the Mazda was our favorite. I highly recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After considering the Highlander, MDX, Pilot, and Enclave, my wife and I settled on the CX-9. While not quite perfect for our needs, it was clearly the best overall SUV, and came out on top for functionality, ergonomics, and as a bonus, it didn't look like the box that a more attractive vehicle came in. We had only looked at the Mazda as an afterthought, figuring we'd end up with the Highlander, but were very surprised at the overall quality and attention to detail in the CX-9. While the Highlander had arguably better performance and interior storage space, it lacked many things the CX-9 offered, such as a split-row third seat and ample room in all three rows, among others. A very good buy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The blind-spot monitor is our favorite; while it's not a substitute for careful driving, it helps in congested, multi-lane traffic. The overall handling is impressive for a vehicle this size. And it has a 3rd row seat that can hold adults and has usable space behind the 3rd row seat even when its up.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased the Mazda Cx9 Touring in September. I have about a 1000 miles on the truck. I enjoy driving this truck, its way better on gas than the LR3 I had. The interior of the vehicle is well designed. I did not get the Grand Touring since cars with nav these days go for less when it's time to trade in or sell. Got the entertainment center with the upgraded Bose stereo it's amazing! Not sure what everyone is talking about but my car has a trip odometer maybe they don't know how to find it. Before I made this purchase I test drove quite a bit of trucks before making my decision. I am glad I went with the CX9.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a VW Beetle, so there isn't much comparison except from the test drives I have been on. We considered a Pathfinder, Pilot and the Highlander. The Pilot was too much like a car and not very responsive. The Highlander was too pricey for the amount of vehicle. The Pathfinder felt really bulky in comparison to the CX-9. I drive about 4 hours every weekend with my wife and great dane. We wanted a vehicle that would allow us to have room for children in the back along with our dog. The gas mileage isn't too impressive, but a vehicle this size just doesn't have that 30 mpg ability right now. The backup cam on the nav screen seems dangerous.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If your tired of the minivan life but can't figure out how to get that sporty ride you've been longing for without giving up the room of your van then take a look at the CX-9. For sure it compromises in some aspects like overall storage but much less than most in this category. Compared to my wife's previous Grand Voyager the level of comfort, styling and performance of the CX-9 more than make up for this. The ride is sure footed meaning its not going to float down the road but its not so tight as to be uncomfortable. Gas mileage seems to live up to what Mazda reports. My wife has averaged 19 mpg with mostly in town driving. Overall, it's a great sporty value for the buck. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty styling and handling are excellent for such a large vehicle; Overall interior room is better than most in its class; Basic stereo with MP3 hookup is more than adequate; and the two tone leather seating is very supportive and appears to be of nice quality. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in an '05 MDX, and after review & test drive of the new MDX and other "premium" CUVs, couldn't believe the value - I suppose maybe a few missing features? No compromise to the ride and handling, however, and great drivetrain with 6 spd manumatic. X5, ML, Audi, etc, have nothing on the CX-9 in terms of the way it drives. Also quiet and comfortable. Mileage is as advertised, not great, though on a recent trip got 18.5 mpg with car loaded down including rooftop luggage. Middle row seat is limousine-like. Only criticism is this is my 2nd Mazda (also a 2007 "3") with a vibrating LH mirror - Mazda can't fix them?? One unscheduled repair for a failed rear wheel bearing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been looking for the perfect large SUV to replace our 04 Chevy Venture that was totaled about three weeks ago, and found it in the CX-9. At first look it is sexy but seemingly too small for my family of 6. But I took one for a test drive to my wife, and we fell in love. It was a base sport model and I was still impressed. The interior design is a 10+, handling is great. I pushed the engine out to about 5000 or 6000 rpm before shifting in manual mode and the tranny was still silky smooth. I had to check the readout to be sure that I even shifted gears. All of my kids fit surprisingly well with two boosters and one car seat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got this about two weeks ago, still w/ only 560 fun miles on it. I compared to an Audi Q7 3.2 which was out of my budget. The Mazda was better in rear passenger room and ergonomics for 2nd and 3rd row passengers. Power was also better because the Mazda was lighter, mine was a FWD CX-9. A lot of technical features for the money. Nice sporty alternative for a 7 passenger vehicle than buying a minivan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Mazda and we love it. Went to auto shows and read many reviews before deciding. Drove the Edge and several others but nothing beat the driving and handling. It is so fun to drive. I traded in a lg SUV and I love the difference - I feel like I'm in a sports car. The room is great, love the dashboard display and the Bose/sunroof. My only 2 complaints are that it could be better on gas and there is no trip odometer. I traded a 5.4 Expedition and I'm only getting 4-5 mpg better.

<TEXT>Ventured back to Mazda after reading all the reviews on SUV/CV market and love the CX-9. Purchased Touring AWD on 1/11/08, and have about 5500 miles on it. Smoothest and quietest ride ever, great stereo, a real joy. Makes my wife's Camry XLE seem awfully loud and rough riding in comparison. Only drawbacks... avg about 16-17 mpg in town, and 18-20 on highway. With a 20 gal tank range is nothing more than 350 miles. Only needs reg gas though so some savings here. But no trip computer. Overall, I would buy again... a real joy to drive. Not a single issue in the 4 months and 5k miles, just an oil change. Enjoy the drive.</TEXT>

Mazda produced a refined and beautifully designed car inside and out with all of the high-tech gadgets I would expect in a $40,000+ car. Look out Acura, Lexus, and Infiniti. Before I bought the CX9, I had compared it with the Ford Edge, Acura RDX, Acura MDX, and even the Mazda CX7. In the end, the CX9 was a no- brainer. The exterior styling looks aggressive. The interior styling is gorgeous. The CX9 has virtually all of the same features as the Acura MDX, but for $1000's less. I liked the power and handling of the CX7, but I preferred the cargo capacity, options, and fuel economy of the CX9.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been a devoted MDX guy and thought I'd try something different. The CX9 seems to be abouit 85% of what an MDX is. That's ok given the price. And it's fun to drive. BUT the options are so confusing that you've got to ask questions about what you're getting and not getting. With the MDX you've got about two choices and you get everything. Some models have the side warning thing, some don't; depends on when during the year it was built. If you want a sun roof you can't have the entertainment pckg. and so on. What most bugs me that there was no 'home link' system to open the garage - something you don't even think to ask about these days. Lesson is go over EVERY detail several times!</TEXT>

My only complaint is that I settled for the black interior which I know will be very hot in the summer. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the Bose stereo, the lumbar support in seat and really have enjoyed the seat warmer.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have a 2004 Mazda 6s (same platform) and though the CX-9 is larger, it still feels like you're driving a sports sedan. Traded in a Mazda Tribute for the CX-9 to gain some more space. The CX-9 is a very quiet ride and excellent for getting our toddler in and out of the back seat. This vehicle is clearly meeting our needs as a young family and we plan to keep this vehicle for a long time. During our comparison shopping, we strongly felt like there was a huge bang for the buck with Mazda. We've had nothing but positive experiences driving all of our Mazdas, especially this vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Loving every minute of driving the CX-9! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Researched Lexus, Toyota, VW, Nissan, Ford and Saturn but none compared to the price, drivability and style of the CX-9. Actually brings back the fun in driving. Bose sound system is the best car stereo I?ve ever heard. Lots and I mean lots of room especially in the second row seating. At 6'1" I actually have room to extend my legs. Third row folds down perfectly for more cargo space. Safety features are endless. Lots of comments on the outside appearance but when they open the doors and look in, they are amazed. Like others, it lacks a few of the items that should be standard, compass and fuel computer</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth is top technology along with the backup camera. Leather is high quality and will withstand the torture of kids and dogs. Safety is evident in the brakes in rear and front body panels, side air bags and rollover sensors.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got this car on Oct. 07 and now I am looking for another brand to trade. Gas mileage is main reason that disappointed me. I got only 15/mpg. Monthly gas payment is same as car payment. Also ride is bumpy, very bumpy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy inside, nice looking outside. AWD rocks!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I traded in an 03 Acura MDX and test drove the 08 MDX, Lexus RX 350, and the Infiniti FX 35 and had seen the Mazda CX 9 at the Houston auto show and decided to stop in to take a quick look at it. We were immediately sold on it after taking it for a test drive. It has all the bells and whistles that the other ones have for about 6k or 7k less at least. Had it for several months now and taken it on one trip and no complaints at all. Very fun to drive, very fast, and plenty of interior room. Do not go buy any midsize or crossover without going to look at the CX 9. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>20" wheels, engine, bluetooth, I pod connector, automatic liftgate, bluelight gauges. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Realizing of course that no vehicle is perfect, I love this vehicle. Previously drove a Mercury Mountaineer and hated it. It drove like a truck and felt very cold. The CX-9 GT is so refined and fun to drive. Smooth, quiet ride, plenty of room, and a very nice feel. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Electroluminescent guages, blue indirect interior lighting, all kinds of storage pockets and drink holders, HID lights, keyless entry, rain sensing wipers, Bose speakers, the list goes on.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It is since 3 weeks, 1000 miles on it. Drive is smooth, but engine roars a lot even on small uphills, or starting from signal light. So too much of interior sound when the gear changes higher. Good pick up, but cannot compare with MDX, absolutely no sound inside. Good shock observers, lot of pot holes literally cannot be felt. Basic Audio system is not great. I have given 9 for performance, reliablity as it is too early to be determined. Expected better fuel economy from a 6 speed gear box.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear back up camera, lot of interior space, sliding second row seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Pretty good CUV. Rides smooth on flat roads, but engine rattles on uphill and makes high rev noise inside the cabin. Lot of wind noise. Looks are ultimate, unmatched. Interior comfort if also good.Too early to tell anything about reliability or performance. fogs inside a lot even under mild humid condition. Lot of people compare this car with MDX, but it definitely cannot match the MDX engine smoothness(Absolutely no noise in MDX), but at least my car makes a lot of engine noise. I don't have a lead foot. Suspensions are very good.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Back up camera in the mirror, good cargo space, decent third row leg space. Locking window glass, switches of the light on the other 3 window glass up and down buttons.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Test drove a Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Volvo XC90. Wife nixed the space-ship looking Nissan Murano on looks alone. I wanted a third row for times when we cart around our kids' friends, and all the luxury amenities. But didn't want to drive a boat; spend more than $35K; or end up driving a boxy, boring SUV like everybody else. The second I saw the Mazda in-person I was sold. Exterior is honestly a work of art. Test drove both the Touring and Grand Touring. Bought the Grand Touring. Much better ride and so many little worthwhile enhancements. Zoom zoom.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Blind spot monitoring system, LED marker lights, Bluetooth, high quality leather in Grand Touring, Smart Key rocks. </FAVORITE>
