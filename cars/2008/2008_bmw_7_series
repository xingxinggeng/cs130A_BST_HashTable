<TEXT>This is my 2nd 750. This is the perfect blend of interior luxury and sports car handling/performance under $100k. Fit and finish are outstanding. The iDrive is fine but the Nav system is terrible. My only complaint on an otherwise perfect car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>smooth acceleration and great handling for such a big auto</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Stay away from night vision. I thought it would be great option but be warned, it is not. It is difficult to use as a driver and by time you see something, there is no time to react. But the downside is that the engineers mounted the camera in a place where rocks and debris can easily damage the lens. I didn't have 3k miles on my car before it went kaput! And, BMW will not fix it for free and the cost of repairs is $4,500.00. And the engineers of BMW also removed the sensor to tell you when a tail light is out. Well mine went our and the 3.00 bulb has been replaced by a LED light that takes the service dept 8 hrs to fix. And after 3 weeks, it's out again! Whats going on?</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an amazing car. Considered the Lexus and Infiniti top models, but they did not stack up against the 750. Stereo is phenomenal; drive and comfort - WOW!! IDrive is completely intuitive, controls are easy, and interior finish is immaculate. The best I have ever driven!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DVD sound system! Stereo! IDrive is too cool. Smooooooth ride. Luxury, comfort, and feel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my car over the weekend and drove two hundred miles from the dealership to my home. Ride quality, technology, build quality and all the features are mind blowing. I have looked at Benz S550 and Lexus LS460 before pulling the trigger on 750LI. In my opinion this car is the best in this class as far as options, interior look, feel, drive and build quality is concerned. I don't know what is the fuss about IDrive? I was able to figure out everything about the IDrive in my two hour drive. It's very good system if you are ready to embrace the latest and greatest in technology 750LI has to offer. IF you are in the market for luxury car in this class then look no more.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>IDrive, luxury seats with tons of features and everything else this car has to offer. Once you are in driver's or passenger's seat you don't want to step out. My kids love the rear comfort seats and these seats can also be adjusted just like the front.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The passenger comfort of this car is hard to beat. Quiet and smooth - I often feel like power napping between meetings! Rear windows not too small or high. At the wheel its a pleasure to drive. But it is b-i-g. Some may feel uncomfortable handling the sheer size. Too early to really say anything about the quality of the build and engine. First impression is very good, but with all the tech there are lots of things that can break or go wrong. Tested another 750li before buying this one - and it had a broken sunshade.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent rear seat adjustment options and lots and lots of leg room. Good seat memory function - also in the back. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall it's just a great car, rides well, always works as it should, Once you get to know iDrive it's a good system but not great, quality fit and finish inside and out, comfortable on the highway, in traffic, or on the twisty back roads. Decent MPG for a large car with a V-8, average 16 MPG, (80 city, 20 highway driving). Can be had at great price right now with slowing sales and a new model coming out soon, if you don't mind driving the older model. Can't beat BMW's warranty and free scheduled maintenance. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great engine, smooth transmission, comfortable front seats and interior, smart dashboard design, balanced ride, sharp handling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had numerous BMW products which I have enjoyed. However, I have never had one that would not accept gasoline in the tank or where the mileage range reads different each time after fueling and gas gage reads something different every 10 to 20 miles. I have no idea most of the time if I have gas or not. I have driven every loner I think BMW has to offer for weeks at a time. My car is in repair so much BMW doesn't call me for a service review. In addition, my cruise is set at 70MPH and my computer reads avg speed is 85 MPH???? So much for my purchase of the "luxury" car when I am driving a loner most of the time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Awesome seat comfort and lots of leg room in the back seat for tall people like myself.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had only considered another S500 or the Lexus LS460 L. I stopped in at the BMW dealer while the wife was shopping just to kill time. After the negative notes on the iDrive and a look I considered "not cool" I was impressed with the close-up look of the exterior and blown away by the interior. One test ride and I was hooked. No doubt it is a blast to drive. The young 'buzzers' that show-off at the stop lights are real surprised when the "large" BMW blows past them after the first 100 ft. or so. The 760 might have been more fun but not enough to justify the extra cost. The iDrive is no big deal to learn or navigate.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased this beautiful car. The seats are luxurious with tons of settings and it even has a driver side massage. The car drives great and is ultra luxurious. However, even with the premium sound $1800 upgrade with 13 speakers, the quality of the radio is horrible. It sounds tinny and when you adjust the base, you lose the midrange and can not adjust that. The feature to give stereophonic sound (Logic 7) sounds terrible and echoes all around when you turn it on. It's amazing that with such an awesome car they would put in this kind of sound system.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seating, leather quality, steering wheel, great climate control (air conditioning is strong) and rear window shades help keep car cool, good storage in front of car, beautiful designed interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really enjoy this 7 series. This is my third 7, and I like the tight feel of driving. The power is intoxicating as it moves! I like the improved iDrive. It is easier to use. The car also fits my size as I am 6'1" and need enough room. It works well with my iPhone, too. Owning this car is a real joy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>You gotta drive it on the highway and cruise!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the fourth BMW 7 series I've had and it is better than the others. Subtle changes from the 2006 and all make the car a bit more fun to drive. Great deals available as it is the last of this model. It is considerably less than a comparable Audi, Mercedes, or Jaguar, and definitely better to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, interior, overall design. I love the iDrive which I know some find difficult. It's the third one for me and other cars seem boring in comparison.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 7 series goes way back, owning many more of them this one is the best. especially from the other competitors like the A8, S class, and the LS. the 7 is a very comfortable machine, very great performance. It will make you fall in love with it in know way you have on a car. If you are thinking about what to get in this range, trust me and get a 7 series. The best car on the planet. </TEXT>
