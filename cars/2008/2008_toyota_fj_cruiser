<TEXT>I'm a designer and I love this true-to-form vehicle for all it allows me to do -granted it's not ideal for parents or carpoolers. I like that the utilitarian design isn't disguised by pricey leather and superfluous features. An avid mountain biker, dog owner, hiker, camper, fisherwoman this SUV does all I need it to with plenty of space and comfort. I do a lot of city driving during the week and I've gotten impressive gas mileage. It's perfect for weekend trips and vacations. What I appreciate most is the customization and easy pricing. If you want to add components you can wrap in what you need without getting sucked into manufacturer's packages. I love my FJ- spring for the woofer!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Spacious back area with fold flat seats, no stain fabric, easy to clean, tall clearance, subwoofer, smooth ride & handling, sweet cup holders.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The FJ cruiser is like buying a prom dress, It has a specific purpose and no other vehicle does it as well. I have driven this vehicle 6000 miles in 3 months, 2/3 on the highway and 1/3 off road. It has no real equal off road, and is very good on the road. I have no qualms about about driving just about anywhere. It goes through heavy snow, fields, mud and on superhighways with ease. I purchase a more aggressive tire than the standard ones it came with and would advise this if you're going off road or in snow. This vehicle is solid, and seems more like a truck than the average SUV. The joy of this vehicle is that it will take you easily where others will not go and do it with ease.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The solid feel, the powerful engine, the rugged build and exterior styling. The way it handles off the road and the great reliability of a well built Toyota. I have had off road contest with a Jeep Rubicon and bested it every time.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My grandfather owned an orig. FJ from 1965 until his death. It looked rough but ran well. Since he taught me to drive I have always wanted one. Never wanted to invest in a rust bucket. When the news ones came out it was a wish come true. You have to love them for yourself. It is not for kids or soccer moms. It is for dad and trip to the outdoors. If you love being outside in the mountains it is worth every penny. I grew up in Colorado and have dreamed of my get away and now it is here. It isn't practical but it is mine and it gets me out in style and reliability. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Comfortable, powerful, quick and nimble. This is my 3rd Toyota. I was going to buy another Jeep Wrangler till I test drove this vehicle. I am impressed with the quality and feel this SUV has. Shifts like butter and handles like a dream. Quiet and spacious has plenty of room for my stuff and kids. Strongly recommend this Toyota product. Test drive one and you?ll be hooked!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The retro look of the FJ and reliability of Toyota brought me to replace my 95 4RunnR. My wife, believe it or not, liked the styling as much as I and the fact it has a good safety rating and she sits high enough to see well. She has had hip problems, but the FJ is no problem for her to get in/out. We like the simplicity of the vehicle. The FJ is a different look, but since most vehicles look alike, the FJ is a step above in styling. We are both in our mid-fifties, but feel good in this. Power is excellent, visibility is OK, Blind spot mirrors solved this problem. We had a dealer installed running boards, passenger arm rest, and towing hitch. No, it is not a Lexus, but it fits us.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, reliability, safety rating, simplicity. Seats are very comfortable and entire interior can be hosed out - to a point. Really like the suicide rear doors. Styling looks like a two door, but has two "extra" doors. Very secure in the back-no need for child locks.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Great Deal</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I've wanted the FJ after the 1st one I saw. And after getting it, I love it. I do a lot of off roading and with a just few add-ons its ready to go. I don't have kids and don't think I would have gotten if I did. For me, the wife and a couple of dogs, its all I need. The interior is great for clean up. I got the all weather mats and it's just a spay down with the hose to clean. The big 4.0L V6 has the power I need off roading or blowing away the "on the phone soccer mom" on the road. It does go through the fuel and you may want to bring some extra on those long trips to the middle of nowhere. There is plenty of head room which has been a problem for me in the past.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I'm not driving a "me too" vehicle. There are very few on the road compared to most autos. The power, nice stereo and I can plug in my iPhone and have my music where ever I go.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I think I need to buy extra medical coverage for my vehicle insurance. Everyone hits their heads when entering/exiting the back seat. The interior panels are below Chevy in build quality and fit. The front windshield wipers chatter, and do not lay flat in cold weather. The exterior paint has scratched very easily. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I hated it first but then fell in love. Now absolutely love. Cannot wait to drive it every day. I have done a great amount of research before purchasing this vehicle. I wanted a Japanese made SUV on a frame for a reasonable price. I did not want to drive a soccer mom SUV. I left me with only one option. It is great on both highway and city. You get used to blind spots after couple days of driving. An extra inch of leg room at the back seat would be helpful. Hey, it is not a family SUV after all. Exhaust is a bit loud. I read that is was done on purpose. FJ has a different exhaust from that of a 4Runner. I would like it more quiet. Overall, you can either love of hate FJ. And I LOVE it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this SUV, fun to drive, goes anywhere. I call it a 2 passenger gas hog though. My only complaint is the back seat, it is to small for a lot of adults, not easy to get in and out of. The flip side is I will never see a soccer mom with car seats in the back driving one. I take it off road whenever I get the chance. I have only had it high centered once but it blasted its way out eventually. Could use serious tires for off-roading. It rides like a car with the factory tires. I added lambskin seat covers from Costco and they are great over the stiff factory seats. If you like fun and don't care about hauling many people get one. I have all the performance extras and get 15-16 MPG.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance, pull off the shoulder of a highway and then back on. Keep it floored to about 80, it is scary (find an empty highway). I have the performance exhaust and cold air intake. It likes Premium but runs fine w/o it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 5th Suv. After having owned Nissans and Jeeps I purchased the FJ for my wife to haul around kids, dogs and ski gear. It is a disaster of design. The interior is dark and visibility is terrible. I can get by these issues however, It's the worst SUV I've ever driven when it comes to performance in snow. We hit the slopes whenever it snows and this vehicle is brutal. Regardless of tires, it's not safe to drive. Coupled with it's nervous anti-lock brakes it's a dangerous vehicle to control in a blizzard. Our Xterra performed much better, with the Jeep being the best. The stain proof seats get dog hair caught in the open fibres and I have to use duct tape to clean it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great roof rack system with modular parts that are easy to adjust. Although the average sized woman will never be able to put a bike up there. It's very high and you can't use underground parking if you have any racks on it. Looks good... but it's a sheep in wolf's clothing. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this car after a lot of research. I am a big Toyota fan and this car has lived up to my expectation. Used to drive a RWD Mercedes Benz and just hated driving it in the winter in Iowa. But this car drives like a champ and is so comfortable. My boys (8 and 4) love the car and can sit comfortably in the rear seat. Blind spot is no big deal. if you drive well you get used to it just like anything else in life. Would not miss out on the other great features of the car because of that.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The drive the cool black color and the seats and of curse the comfortable space. Finally the reliability of Toyota. So far no car comes close to it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle for off road. The stock vehicle is poorly set up for serious use off road (plastic bumper imitation skid plates, etc.) There 98% of complaints end. The off road ability even with stock tires is unbelievable. I have changed rims, ties and added armor (skid plates, rock sliders and real bumpers). The performance and power need to be driven to be believed. The standard vehicle is small inside, it ain't a Suburban. There is limited storage space. The hood is high and forward visibility is limited. If you can't drive with mirrors this vehicle is not for you. FJ could use more sound deadening. Very noisy at high speed. it hauls and turns on a dime. I love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Unreal off road performance. Good looks. I have the sand color and it turns heads. Good stereo, good lighting, inside and out. Easy to clean out. The cabin filter leaves the inside immaculate no matter how dusty the trail. The three wipers perform better than any vehicle I have owned.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased my FJ after my Jeep Wrangler 4 dr was totaled after hit head on. Was going to buy another Jeep until I test drove the FJ and read consumer feedback on this sight. Although I haven't put many miles on, the FJ has lived up to my expectations. Plenty of room for me and my 2 boys, age 9 and 13. The suicide doors aren't an issue much to my wife's reluctance. As far as the blind spot people complain about, if you know how to drive, use your mirrors, and have driven an SUV, there is no discussion! My only wish is that Toyota comes out with a rag top in this model. Plenty of power, more comfortable than the Jeep.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Since 2007 I had been looking at the FJ but was not willing to pay the price. I read reviews and did my research for nearly a year. I love this vehicle. It drives great, handles great for the vehicle type, and it has very good power to get up & go. It is a very capable off-road vehicle. I have had it off-road on some rough trails and the FJ performed like a champ. Visibility is not that bad and it is something you can get adjusted to. The suspension is nice a tight and provides plenty of confidence on the road. Also, regular unleaded fuel is acceptable to use. My dealership stated this and so does Toyota. Gas mileage is not bad considering. Plenty of room for a family of 5 on any occasion.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ability to fit all 3 of our kids in the rear seat with car seats and still have room. I love the sunfusion yellow and the TRD wheels with BFG T/A ko tires. The base stereo is pretty good with the addition of a sub and some speakers in the rear cargo area. That will surround you with sound.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Trust me, this is a very capable vehicle in all aspects. I usually don't write reviews, but in the case of the FJ I am making an exception. Like most of you, I did a lot of extensive research before I made my final vehicle decision. My advice would be not to get hung up on the negative reviews, and focus on the positive ones, it'll save you a lot of wasted time. The blind spots are not as bad as some people say they are. The rear seats do fold all the way down. Road noise is not noticeable and the interior is quiet. This vehicle is extremely reliable, and capable of some astounding things. This vehicle has been tested to its limits and still scores big! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety! I was rear ended pretty hard by a sedan, and the hitch absorbed all the impact. Fun factor, I love to drive around in it. It goes anywhere.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A great SUV for the money. Bought it for the Toyota quality and reliability and wanted the best 4x4. I have the manual with full time four wheel drive and my mileage is consistently 21-23 hwy and 19 city. Solid, fun to drive, and it does grow on you. I put on 2 blind spot mirrors which do help a lot. However I find that all the hype about the poor rear view is nonsense anyway. If you know how to drive it's no problem. I fish in Canada and have gotten stuck with my old domestic 4x4 (don't know how they can call them true 4x4s). I finally bought something that will get me in/ out of less than poor road and landing conditions. Love the VSC and traction control. I rarely ever lock everything in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I work out of my automobiles and had driven a Honda CRV for the past 5 years. It was time for a new vehicle and I had decided to buy another Honda. The night before I went to buy it I was on the computer researching cars and read the reports on the FJ Cruiser. I decided to go and give it a test drive that next morning. Thank goodness I did. I knew the minute I drove it this was the SUV for me. I love it! I have only had it for a short time but it feels safe and I love the way it handles. Oh, did I tell you how great I think it looks?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked for 3 months at SUVs and I always came back to the fj. It was big purchase for me because I wanted a vehicle that was going to be truly reliable and not in the repair shop all the time and I have worked previous at 2 GM dealerships, even all my mechanic friends give it 2 thumbs up! I've driven in some pretty crazy 4x4 zones with it and it's performed excellent, and a truly fun truck to drive. I don't find the blind spot a big deal and everyone that has sat in the backseat has found it easy to enter and exit. I would suggest to all, to take one for a test drive. They grow on you... they are a different driving experience and different is good from the norm.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the suicide doors, easy access. The stereo is great..it's neat how you can change the colours on the display panel. The interior is so easy to keep clean and the cargo area door lock feature (for wind) is awesome. I love the windshield washer vessel.. it's huge. My #1 is the Balanced Engine!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Takes a bit getting used to the blind spots. Love the car to the max! Fun to drive, 4X4 is really nice. Have a friend with a Jeep Wrangler and goes toe to toe off road with it and is much more practical. A few things I would improve would be the seats do not have a forward track for the people getting into the back seat. You have to manually move it forward from the front. The rear windows do not go down. Does not seem like a big deal, but the wind whips through the truck like crazy. Last thing would be the back window would be nice if it would go down like with the 4 runner. But all in all I would highly recommend this vehicle!! BUY IT! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my FJ a couple weeks ago. I'm getting 20+ MPG. I drive conservatively (coasting in neutral when I can), taking off slow and planning for stops ahead of time - right now, I'm getting better than the advertised MPG (25% city driving). It's a pleasure to drive and very comfortable. The only problem is getting into the back seat - Toyota should have provided some kind of handle to help pull yourself into the back seating area (my youngest struggles to get back there, clawing at anything she can to help herself in).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new FJ cruiser. It looks great and is fun to drive. Comfortable for long trips. Major blind spots, but nothing you can't get used to, no worse than in a pick up truck. Engine really scoots. Gas mileage isn't great, but acceptable for suv. Not a vehicle for everyone. I find there is more that I like about it, then there is that I do not like about it. Lots of great after market accessories available, but have to wait until warranty is up. Windshield collects bugs, but a layer or rain-ex helps keep them from sticking. I have no regrets purchasing this vehicle and look forward to driving it every day!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned my FJ for 1 year and have over 30k in that time. Have long daily commute and work in Atlanta, GA. I have had no issues with blind spots in Atlanta traffic or parking, or navigating narrow downtown roads. Great driving feedback from the vehicle allows you to know exactly where you are. On weekends, this vehicle is in N GA on a trout stream or working on family land hauling gear for clearing brush etc. Then it cleans up in a snap and heads back downtown to the office. Does exactly what a land cruiser should do.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very happy with my Trail Teams FJ. The 6 speed FJ is a joy to drive, performance is commendable & the off road capability is amazing. As a daily driver I'm getting 17.2 mpg with 50% in town travel. The Trail Teams treatment is well thought out, all the off road goodies in one package, and the Iceberg White monotone paint with black accents is very attractive as well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is built strictly for off-road application. Don't buy it for the city use or for home-office commute. To park this car in the city is impossible task and this is not because of physical dimensions. It has too many blind spots, you always concern you might hit somebody. The backseat is not adjustable and people on the back have very little space. Besides the backseat passengers might got trapped in case of accident with no way out. You will not be able to open door if the people in the front got disable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Off all the reviews I have read they just don't hit the experience of owning the Toyota FJ. Every time I drive my FJ I fall in love with it more and more. I'm 40 this month and driving it makes me feel 21 again. Sure the blind spot everyone talks about exist, but it is not hard to get used to. As for the gas mileage complaints, I am running regular unleaded in my FJ. It runs perfect and I'm getting a combined 19 miles to a gallon right now. That is great for this type of vehicle. Really great leg room in the front. I purchased the sandstorm color, and love the color more every time I look at it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>FJ styling... there's nothing else like it out there. Ride is pretty good, just a little bumpy, but to be expected. Great power/acceleration. Would like a tan interior option. Black really shows dirt/crumbs. Kids don't have any problem getting in and out of back seat (except for tight parking spaces). Do away with ceiling "speaker exciter", that thing is junk. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All around cool car. Backup sonar is great. Can't beat the styling. Lots of room in engine to get at parts. Oil filter location is great. Side visors nice addition. Haven't had any visibility problems. Windshield does catch lots of bugs though. Like the simplicity of interior, no carpet. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Was hooked after my first drive. Handles very well for what it is. Getting about 18mpg by keeping my foot "out of it". Should get better mileage on the highway. Installed a K&N air filter and use Mobil 1 synthetic oil. The motor seems strong and is always willing to rev. It's easily handling the current No. Indiana winter. No problem, from mushy slush, to blowing thru drifted-over county roads. It tracks and runs well. Could use better visibility but you'll learn to drive with the mirrors. Ventilation could be better. Having a small issue with the paint job on the hood. I do plan on keeping this vehicle for a long time as it feels strong and has a basically good build design. I like it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature is the true utility nature of this vehicle. Brought some wood home for the stove one day, wife and I were out running the roads the next. Cleans up real easy.

This FJ Cruiser received a 5 star rating (best rating available) for frontal crash test. It also received a 4 star rating for side impact crash test. The 4wd option works great on my icy hill. Unlike some of the 4wds I've owned, this FJ allows me to engage/disengage the 4wd therefore allowing me to save money on gas, 20mpg. This FJ also has a 5000 lb towing capacity which is more than enough to tow my 3000 boat. The ride is unbelievably smooth and powerful with the 4.0 L 6cylinder engine.No carpet/easy clean interior!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth ride. Easy clean interior. Suicide doors/easy to get kids in back seat. Oil filter near top of engine! Powerful engine 5000lb towing capacity </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just got it and I'm in love! The very first thing I noticed was the blind spots but I will deal since I have the rear sensors. Mine is loaded and it's perfect! I was surprised at how smooth and comfortable it is. I can't wait to get it off the road!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I live in CO so the heater is awesome. Also love stereo/subwoofer and the room in the back. Sun visors are great too! No carpet is the best idea ever in a 4wd.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you plan to go off-roading opt for the All Terrain Pkg. It comes w/ very nice 16" wheels (diff look from the 17"), great shocks, locking diff, A- trac, pre-cleaner & multi-info display. I ordered the TRD exhaust which I think is a plus, cool ellipse tip and sound. It came with blk running boards which will not work as rock rails, but will save you from car- level door dings. Ride quality is great for a 4x4. We have gone on fun adventures and seen things that would have required some serious hiking. With the right mind-set the FJ will make a great primary vehicle. As a 2nd vehicle to our German sedan we could not be happier. Hard to imagine the sedan is now a 2nd choice when driving to work!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Classic looks, stands out from the cookie cutter SUVs. Its a Toyota with the heritage of the original Land Cruiser. Seats with water resist fabric. Skip the carpet and get the serious rubber mats (you will not be disappointed). The feeling I get in the middle of no-where in total comfort. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the 4th 4X4 I have owned and none of them have been this much fun. I have only put 1800 miles on my FJC but they have been great miles. My wife drove it the 120 miles home from the dealer but all the rest are mine. I have traveled the far reaches of the western Utah desert and the close reaches of the Buckhorn draw desert. I have gone up hills and over terrain that I have never been in an SUV, only a honda 4 wheeler. The heater and music are a lot better than the 4 wheeler. I enjoy the music even the woofer for a 48 yr old, Never been around MP3 but I'm an expert now. TRD exhaust wasn't necessary but enjoy that too. This new FJC is like the fountain of youth to me behind the wheel. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Goes every where up down across any terrain I have tried to go through. Is well suited for me, wife and 15 yr old son, grandkids like the up and down part. First time I've had a locker, great item. Music a must and comfortable seating if son sits behind wife. Very fun ride. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought it about 3 weeks ago and love this vehicle. It is fun to drive, good on power, great off-road and has a unique look. I like the big control knobs and handles. I took it on a little trail when I went camping and locked the 4wd in just to try it and it handled great! It has that high quality feel that all Toyotas seem to have. It does have blind spots but the big mirrors make up for that.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Big buttons, control knobs and handles. Different looking than anything on/off the road. Plenty of power, supercharger is now available from TRD if not enough power. Interior floors can be washed out with a hose. Great stereo with subwoofer, mp3 port and 6 disk changer. Lots of accessories available.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I pick the CQ & Sport package plus the roof rack & tow hitch package. The ride is excellent especially in the beaten up city road (NY City). Although the engine is silky smooth, the exhaust is kind of loud when starting at slow speed. Blind spot is an issue, make sure you order the rear sonar. I'm ordering a rear view camera as too many kids play around my driveway. This truck is tall, makes you feel sitting in a bigger truck, great view, in return, it need 6'9" clearance for indoor parking clearance with the roofrack. Gas mileage is as expected at about 20 mpg hwy @ 75-80 mph.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style & predict excellent resell value. Comfortable seat, roomy interior, smooth powertrain & excellent fit & finish. Great value. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a joy it is to drive again. I took this off-road with only 350 miles on it. Nothing radical, just steep and rutty stuff, and it handled great. When changing directions after a stop, you seem to get time to go from brake to throttle before you start to free roll much. I loved going back down Jones Pass Rd, jamming into 1st gear at 20 mph and doing a 180 down to the next switchback. The FJ felt real stable, and handled the bumps like a pro. On the pavement, the ride is nice and not "trucky". 20 mpg highway/city/mtn is great. My 2.9L Ranger was no better than that.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Knobs big, good with gloves on. Not fancy, just practical. Not a "soccer mom's" car (thank goodness), more of a "guy's toy" vehicle, although it's my one and only. No carpet to stain. Nice sound system/aux jack. Room for the grandkids, too. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>City driving is easy, but rear visibility is limited so definitely get the rear park assist. Off-road capability is top notch. Rocks, mud, water crossing - the FJ has pulled through for most. Personal experience has proven that if you take the vehicle off-road, or add after market wheels and/or bumpers, the warranty is voided. So, either buy it for city driving or buy a different vehicle for off-road use if you need a warranty.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The capability, style, and uniqueness of this vehicle put it at the top of my list. Simple engine layout, easy access, and Toyota quality.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The FJ has great power, excellent off road capability, and handles like a dream. The only flaws with the FJ is the huge blind spots, and the airplane style rear windows. The mirrors compensate well for the blind spots though. Wonderful car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent off road capabilities. Not a soccer mom SUV.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Some may call it a mid-life crisis, but I call it fun. The 2008 FJ Cruiser is a break from the norm, a good one, and has to be one of the most fun vehicles on the market today. The inside reminds me of an early 70s Chevy Blazer: cool. The driving position is excellent, and the seats are comfortable. One can't help but feel safe with all the standard air bags, stability controls, and just the sheer size of everything. The FJ says cool simplicity vs. sophisticated. Fuel economy is not great, but is better than many SUVs. While not for everyone, the FJ is easily the best car I have ever owned. Do you get up in the morning excited to get in your ride? Not to rub it in, but I do.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style, simplicity, off-road ability yet refined ride on the highway.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fun to drive - looks great. Really look forward to driving FJ daily. I realize this is strange, but non-aerodynamic windshield does not deflect bugs, so one must be ready to clean windshield quite a bit.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>No-nonsense interior, all very functional, very good factory stereo with sub-woofer.</FAVORITE>
