<TEXT>After reading, test driving,etc. etc. I just couldn't talk myself out of getting this Explorer and am so glad I didn't! I love it, the ride is great, easy for my elderly parents to get in and out, as well as the grandkids! I actually look forward to driving to work! Interior is very nice and easy to use audio system. Can't say anything bad about it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Audio system, the ride, comfortable seats and easy access to rear storage area.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this car for about a year now. Great pickup with the v6 and good power. Would suggest to anyone who wants an import. It just is not worth the extra money when this car is so much less and preforms just as well if not better. As for the interior not being stiched leather, get over it. its a ford, not a lincoln. No problems whatsoever. Car tells me when to get my oil changed, low tire pressure, low gas, etc. It has a very smart on board computer. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync. Base sound system. Agressive front styling. smooth ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This marks my third Ford Explorer. My only complaint is the center mounted shifter. The previous one (2002) had ample amounts of area for your stuff. Considering the price as compared to a Toyota 4Runner, Nissan Pathfinder or other comperable vehicles the explorer was WAY WAY WAY more truck for the money. It literally cost almost 1/3 less than the two above mentioned rides. I can live with some small quirks for the money I saved.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>In a word, SYNC!!!!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2008 explorer 17 days ago. This is my 6th Explorer since 91. The 2008 model year is nicely styled, although personally I like the 05 much better - much classier look opposed to the chrome bars and round gauges. At first I hated the center mounted shift knob but my hand rests on it when using the arm rest, so its actually comfortable. Like others have said, interior parts are cheap. Overall I like Explorers, but this 08 has had a number of issues. In 17 days of ownership (bought with 16,200 mi on it) a speaker died, a part in the catalytic converter system failed and needed to be replaced, and the no cap gas cap filler neck had to be replaced due to improper sealing. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I have never had problems with past explorers, so did I just get a bad one, or should you overlook the 08? Favorites: Exterior styling, comfort, drivability, safety, size, height, availability of parts for when it has problems, and durability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had my Ex for about 3 months now. It's great SUV because it has everything I need. The V6 is just enough for me, I mainly do city driving. I like the leather quality on the seats. It is very quiet and I love the comfort on the 2nd row.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync has to be the best feature on this car. It lets you control your stereo without lifting a finger. The power running boards are great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Drivers over 6' 3" should consider another vehicle. The power seats tilt back when they go down so you sit leaning back which is very uncomfortable. With the moon roof you loose about 1.5" of headroom so tall people will have their head rubbing the roof. I thought I could live with this but the car must go!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Car look great drives great. My last one ran to 195K and still looked good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Went from an '07 4Runner to the Explorer. Really love the Sync system and the softer ride. Seems to be a really solid vehicle and very capable. "Classy" seems to be a word that is very appropriate for the Explorer, expecially given the re- design of the front end. Given that the V-6 gets similar mileage to the V-8, wish I would have gone with the V-8 now for the extra power. Would also suggest going with the upgraded stereo system as the standard unit is very mediocre. However, I feel the Explorer is a very good value for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync System is awesome! Interior is very comfortable and puts you up in the air like an SUV should. Overall ride is also very good for a truck- based SUV. Really love the look of the 18" chrome wheels. Safety features aren't sexy, but are appreciated. Did I mention how cool the Sync System is?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Previously owned a 2005. This one has the cheesy chromed instrument cluster/tunnel?),chromed round air vents. I liked the retangular ones better, not gimmicky, but kept with the truck-like theme and feel of the rest of the SUV. I also liked the column mounted shift lever, now in the console it takes up space; lever so huge-looks out of place and gets in the way of the controls especially when in park-that was another gimmicky move, form over function, I hate that. New door handles are bulbous. Engine roars-needs insulation but bulletproof. U-Haul still won't rent a trailer to Explorer owners, what a shame. It pulls them great. With that said, it is solid, boxed framed and spacious. Buy it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Large storage behind 2nd row seating, towing ability, comfortable, handles better than a new Durango that I drove. I like the solid truck-like feel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Each of my Explorers I have purchased new. 1994,2003,2008 and each have been much improved from the previous. I still own the 2003. The 08 is definitely a flagship, very comfortable, some cheap shortcuts though have me disappointed. The chrome clad wheels, I didn't realized till purchased but come on Ford this are very cheesy. Each one of my previous Explorers all top of the line have had solid chrome or aluminum wheels. If I would have realized this I probably would not have bought it. Another disappointment is the cheap interior. For 42000 it should be plush. But overall the ride is great and seats comfortable, plenty of power with the V8. I like the new one more everyday.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync and the navigation, also being able to plug I-pod up directly is nice. Power running boards are cool. Nice power increase from the 2003 V8. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second SUV. I?ve owned it for 8 months now and had no problems with it. It?s fun to drive and has a great view. The cargo area is huge. The V8 has plenty of power, which I use to tow a boat. It has a truck like ride. It?s handles very predictably, and excellent in the snow. I really like all of the safety features. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good power, plenty of cargo space, Sync, dual zone climate control, heated seats, towing capacity, saftey features and ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the third Explorer we have owned, beginning in 1993, and by far the best. The ride is great for an SUV and the third seat makes it possible to carry all the grandkids at once. This is the least expensive and best equipped Explorer we have owned. I do wish the gas mileage was better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The overall design of the interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Explorer, I still own a '97 XLT with 100k on it with minimal major problems/repairs. The '07 does have an annoying rough idle clicking that it's done since new. The '08 has the 292hp v8 which idles smoothly and has plenty of power when needed. The interior and exterior is flawless and amazingly quiet. Everyhing worked perfectly when we picked it up and ever since. Better gas mileage would help but I need the truck frame for towing and the v8 for power.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove the 4 runner and Pilot and they are nice but I'm very glad that I relooked at Ford they really steped up and I like the ride and feel of the Ford best, it's fun to drive! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride and feel is awsome, lots of power, I like that it looks like an SUV not a car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my fourth Explorer and they just keep getting better! The features, versatility and the price can't be beat. The V-6 fuel ecomomy isn't great but, I get the same MPG that I got with my Acura MDX and I don't have to run premium fuel. The Sirius radio and Sync system are great. Towing two SEA- Doo's GTX's takes a little effort, but the vehicles handles and stops well. The third row seats are great for kids under twelve and I love the power up and down feature. The second row seats recline but they do take a little effort to move up and out so people can get into the third row. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync, Sirius, Class 3/4 trailer hitch set-up with two different types of electrical plug ins, Power fold 3rd row seats. Rear air conditioning and heating controls, Reverse sensing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned 3 Explorers, starting with 1991, 2000 and now 2008. What an evolution this vehicle has had. The 2008 is superb, build quality, ride, handling, amenities are all excellent. It has performed superbly in the snow. I really like the Sync product and after taking 2 years to decide what my next SUV would be I couldn't be happier. Yes, it could get better mileage, but again, for the money I could not find a better buy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Solid, no rattles. Seats are comfortable and heated. Sync is fantastic, the hands free phone and USB connection are great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car! I got the Ironman edition with the Orange Frost color. Get comments on it every day mostly of people who like the orange! But this car is awsome! Drives really nice with low amount of road noise. Don't like the fuel economy so much. the v6 has enough power but nothing crazy. Has a lot of room with very comfortable seats front and back. Ironman p adds some cool bumpers and side pannels with a blacked out grille. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats! Orange color/ironman package and 4wheel drive</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just returned from a five day trip in our new Ford Explorer Limited. We are very happy with it except for the loud engine noise that it makes when you barely put on the gas to pass, going up an incline or just taking off. We gotta get something done about this problem. I have purchased a stream of Exploerers and this has to be by far the loudist of all which makes me think there is something wrong in the manifold/exaust area connections or that there is far too little insullation on the rear fire wall. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After 10 weeks, I finally took delivery of my 2008 Eddie V8. It was worth the wait! I can't say enough good about the amazing handling, ride, and power. Going from a F150 back to an SUV I was worried about not having enough space or horsepower. Delete the 3rd row seat if you don't need it, there is nice storage in the floor. I did have to do some setup to unprogram the auto moving exit seat and some timers, but the digital read out made it very easy. SYNC is (so far) flawless with iPod and cell phone. Test drive a V8 if you get the chance, much better than the V6. The shifter gets in the way of climate controls (dual zone digital)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Microsoft Sync is amazing. Seat/pedal adjust will fit any driver. V8 is worth the extra money. Handles well, rides like a luxury car. </FAVORITE>
