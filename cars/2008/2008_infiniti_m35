<TEXT>Had for 15 months. This car is awesome. I cannot understand any complaints except for maybe gas mileage. It's what you should expect for a large sport sedan. Infiniti service and dealership was & still is excellent. In/out the door in less than an hour. Will keep this vehicle for a long time. Sporty, classy, comfortable and people love looking at it. What a deal!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well I needed to replace our Buick and with GM going down the toilet I figures I better move to the Japanese. Spent 3 months looking for a luxury car. Anyway, I walked into the Infiniti dealership here and the friendliness was fabulous. They had an 08 M35x that the manager was driving with 18,000 kms in sandstone. What a beautiful car. We drove it for a day and were hooked. They gave it to me for 20K less than new. They gave me 10K for my Buick and I was stunned. I drove this out of there in mint condition for 30K Canadian. WOW I couldn't buy a v6 accord for that. Driving the car for a month now and am awestruck by the quality. This thing is a tank. Put new Michelin Pilot Pluses on - WOW!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I dreamed of getting an M35 for years so you'd think I ran a great risk of being disappointed by such high expectations. Like almost every Christmas which never lives up to my visions. The M is better than I could have imagined. I do wish it got better mileage but my average mpg of 22 combined is just fine for what I am getting to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow!! What a fun car to drive. I have thoroughly enjoyed every moment I get into my car. Plenty of passing power, handles like a sport car and I love the firmness of the suspension. This is truly a luxury sports sedan for a person not looking to buy a 2-dr sports car. Everything I am looking for in a sports sedan. The interior is beautiful and everything is laid out nicely. Plenty of room front and back. Did I mentioned the car handles awesome? I love the way the car look... very clean!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>For what would otherwise be an under-powered luxury sports sedan that is an excellent value, the steering issue called tramlining makes the M35X an unsafe highway car. Everything else is wonderful: comfort, electronics, etc.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Right after Thanksgiving my local dealer was having a big sale and I bought an 08 M35X. Drove it home in a snow storm and the all wheel drive is excellent. The command center is filled with everything you can imagine. Jukebox, Ipod integration, satellite radio, CD. Rides out great. Very luxurious interior and the 3.5 really moves when you need to. I have only put about 6k on the car so far, but love it. As soon as my wife's lease is up on her car she wants the G37x.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The M35 AWD is an electronics powerhouse with an amazing array of safety and convenient features. Unfortunately, it suffers from a serious steering problem, called tramlining, which makes the handling not only unsatisfactory but also dangerous. I replaced tires twice before I learned from a conscientious mechanic of an Infiniti dealership that the problem is with the steering rack, which Nissan refuses to replace. Based on this shortcoming, I would place a BMW and an Audi ahead of an Infiniti. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove a few cars including the new 2009 TL, a 2008 E350 and a 2008 528I. The Infiniti held its own against these three fine vehicles, both on performance and luxury comparisons. Both the BMW and the Mercedes are excellent vehicles, but comparably equipped would have cost me $10k to $15k more. The TL costs slightly less, but felt a little smaller and although design tastes are subjective, I liked the M's feel much better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The economy stinks right now, and I was able to get a 2008 M35 with about 10,000 miles for what I thought was a ridiculously low price. We were looking at Honda CRVs and other mini SUVS (loaded). I hate SUVs and convinced my wife that this was the car to buy - and now she loves it. The driving experience is almost as good as the BMW 745, and it has a ton of features. I recommend the base model because the sport model has a really stiff ride. It has a nice, isolated yet sporty feel. For the money, I don't think you can beat it. Against its competitive set, it is a good value and a great car, but at the prices you can get now it is probably unbeatable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the M35x in October which means it was almost last years car. Problem was tramlining, or the movement of the car over uneven pavement. Ever drive on a highway that's been used by a lot of trucks. This car will jump all over the place. I researched and got the tires replaced with Michelins by dealer. Tramlining decreased by about 75%! Yes, this car eats gas. My 04 Murano with same VQ35 engine gets a lot better mileage. A lot more comfortable than our 2003 Mercedes C320 and hopefully a lot more reliable. I didn't want AWD but in NJ all that's available is AWD. Too bad!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My M35 has been a pleasant car. As someone going for more of a relaxed ride, the M35 was nice, but I wish it would be a just a bit more soft. Then again, this is a sports car, and performs like one too. The interior is beautiful, the navigation is nice, and the rear seat room is actually quite good. HOWEVER, this car is a gas machine. If you want a fuel efficient car, look toward buying maybe a GS. I've gotten a combination of 18 mpg, which was expected, but disappointed because it's only a V6.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased the M35 since it was such a great value at the time compared to the Mercedes E350 we almost bought. The M35 feels solid with predictable handling, and the optional technology and advanced technology packages round out the car well. While not as quiet and smooth as the E350, it's a solid car with respectable performance and comfort. Reliability likely won't be a concern, with a standard 60K mile warranty. Wind noise is somewhat noticeable at highway speeds, gas mileage a bit disappointing, and the performance tires transmit some road noise into the cabin. But for the deals that Infiniti is offering right now, it was simply a no-brainer. A fine car and a no-regrets purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased an M35 with the Tech and Sport package and I love the car. It is a perfect combination of sport and comfort. My previous two cars were an 04 Acura TL and 01 BMW 530i. I considered the Lexus GS and BMW 528i. The Lexus was not sporty enough and the BMW was not as good a value. With the Tech and Sport package this car has all the goodies I wanted at a great price. This is a car my whole family likes. Plenty room in the back for my thirteen year old daughter and her friends. All the technology a thirteen would want. My wife enjoys the heated and cooled seats (Texas) as well as the navigation, bluetooth, sat radio and iPod connection and we all like being seen in it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is almost perfect if you want a more sporty ride. The suspension, gearing and exhaust all are more sport oriented than the Lexus type comfort some may anticipate. The steering is the only non-sporty aspect of the M35. It is overly sensitive and loose at center. Constant correction is required at highway speed. The V6 leaves you wanting at times, but that is why they offer a V8. The car needs more gears. The new FX 7 speed transmission should fix this. The M35 cost less than some of its competitors but I think it lacks a few features if you look closely. Infiniti is learning and will pull it all together with the next iteration.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Appearance, comfort, interior room. Performance is great minus the steering. The power is good without a load up to about 80 MPH. Braking is very solid. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I usually lease an SUV to carry equipment for my company. My last was an Escalade ESV. But now I don't carry much anymore so I wanted a car and much lower monthly payments. I drove the Mercedes E350, BMW 5 series, Audi A6, Cadillac STS, DTS and Lexus (forget the model but was the same size). I want the latest features. I was used to the backup camera. I think it is a safety feature and I will not buy a car without it. I want navigation and satellite radio. I want rear, side, etc air bags. I want electric mirrors, electric cool & heated seats. I want a quiet and not-underpowered car. I do not want to spend 1 cent on fluff (sport packages, chrome wheels, etc) I am over 40.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I switched out of my E Class Mercedes after years of electrical problems into one of the best cars I've ever owned. The quality of the car is unsurpassed, the dash beautiful and the seating absolutely comfortable. My Mercedes was anything but reliable with numerous problems and never dealers never able to fix them on the first, second or maybe the third try. On the other hand the Infiniti M35x is perfect. There's room for five and large trunk and a great sound system. My only complaint is the awful gas mileage. In the city it averages a bit over 14 and on the road barely 21. With today's gas prices I don't care who you are that kind of mileage is unacceptable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>All around a nice vehicle! A bit pricey compared to other models but better than BMW. Very nice ride and a lot of fun to drive, quiet at highway speeds but it could have a little better mileage. Very nice electronics package! Could face very stiff competition from the new Lincoln MKS mileage-wise and price wise. But, all around a very nice vehicle and fun to drive. A "9" out of "10"! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought M35S and am very pleased. This car is exciting to drive and turns heads. HVAC is top notch & cools down quickly even in MS! Road noise is barely noticeable. Seats are supportive, comfortable and cooled. Great touch! Would buy another one immediately if stolen. XM & iPod make the car very enjoyable on trips. If you want a classy sports car, this is it! Own a 2007 FX-35 too and will remain brand loyal.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I find the M35 to be at the top of the list in this class. The build quality is outstanding and the ride (non-sport) is very comfortable. Reports have indicated that road noise at speed is more than it should be. I think most cars with sport tires and wheels of this design will transmit a bit more noise to the cabin at speed. It isn't enough to even be concerned with unless you are an absolute freak about total silence. The exterior design is eye catching and the interior is by far the most impressive I have seen in any car. The drop in Lexus reliability and the unsubstantiated excessive cost of the BMW, took those two off my list early. A great car and a real value.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling and ride are top notch. Controls are intuitive and well positioned. The technology package is a "must have" feature which is well worth the price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My husband and I bought a new M35 in February. On May 10 we were in a series accident with a 1999 truck, the car and truck was totalled. A very bad accident that could have taken my husband's life with the truck hitting in the driver's door, but because of the excellent safety features of the car especially the curtain airbags our lives were spared. I only had the car for 3 months, but it was a great car and I loved it and will probably buy another one when I'm able to drive again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had an 06 M35 Sport, got this M35x when lease expired. Have had 2 J30s, an early Q45 and now second M35. All I have ever done is put in oil and follow maintenance schedule, reliability could not be better. I looked at A6, Acura RL, MB C and E class, and BMW 5. Previously have owned Audi, Acura, BMW, but enjoy the M35 the most. The ride is so much more comfortable in the 35x than the Sport and quieter too. Yet it is plenty firm with good road feel. Very fun to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>To my taste the interior is head of the class, especially front dash. Seats are excellent. Keyless ignition is nice, especially in winter, don't have to hunt around for the key. Great road feel but comfortable too. I find the upgraded stereo fine</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I used to own the Q45 and switched for all wheel drive (Ausi A8). After 8 years of German cars I am back. This car is really well thought out and is quality throughout. It rides great, although i might have preferred the 8 cylinder M45. It has plenty of get up and go, so maybe i will get used to it. Everything else about the car from the handling, comfort, appearance and space is fantastic. I am a big guy (6'3") and I have plenty of room for me and the person sitting behind me. The stereo is very good and it doesn't matter what your source of music is, the car can handle it. I looked at the Acura RL, Lexus GS and the Audi A6. M35x was the clear winner.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Tech package: The stereo has a 9GB HD to rip your CD's , it will control my iPod, CD player, XM radio. The smart key is a great convenience. No fumbling for keys, just open the door, as long as your key is with you. Bluetooth phone implementation is flawless. Nav pkg is very intuitive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had the 2006 model, and just purchased the 2008 model with the sport package. This car is far better than any of its competitors, and comes with an abundance of standard features. The ride is sporty, yet comfortable. The interior is well appointed, and well thought out. The navigation system is by far the best and most sophisticated one out there, yet its very easy to use. You can talk to it via voice commands while driving (most competitors force you to type in directions while in park). Buy one, you wont regret it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded me FX35 with sport package in for M35 with Tech/Sport. M35 drives similarly to FX35 (which was fun to drive) but a little quieter. Test drove GS/LS, A6/A8, XJ/XF and found the M to be a good mix between comfort and fun. But Lexus is a step ahead in term of technology. Interior design is what sold me on the car. A6/A8 are too confusing, GS/LS are too boring, XF is as good if not better, but less room in the back.</TEXT>

<FAVORITE>The 2006 M35 did not have any way to connect my iPod so I was looking for that in the 2008 model. The 2008 has the iPod connection, but even better is the MusicBox (hard drive) that rips your CDs and stores them in the car for easy access.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It's the perfect car for me. I considered Cadillac CTS, Acura TL, Lexus ES, even the G35x, but the M35x had them beat with styling, features, and yes, value for the money. As a music lover, I can't say enough about the integrated iPod hookup/hard drive/flash drive and XM radio. I'm sure there are audiophiles out there who will complain about the Bose stereo, but believe me, it's fine. (You'll hear better & worse depending on whatever other car you're interested in.) Controls are easy to use; comfortable seats (heated/cooled); nav w/backup camera is dandy; Bluetooth/voice activation is intuitive; and, of course, it looks fantastic both inside & out! Drive it and see for yourself!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2008 Infiniti is far superior to the 07 model inasmuch as the exterior has had a much needed facelift (revised front and rear fascia, grille, rear fender panels, rear deck lid and taillight design, new chrome accents and 18-inch sport wheels). I passed on the 2007 model last year when car shopping for a friend but bought it for myself this year. The interior is roomy and all controls are within easy reach. The view from the cockpit is good and the hood doesn't disappear from view as with the Acura. Good all-around handling for the money led me to choosing the M35 over BMW, Acura, Lexus and Mercedes (I tested them all).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling is excellent but could use a few more horses for standing starts. Accelleration through the gears gets your blood flowing nicely. This highlight for me is the new hard drive navigation system with full voice controls along with the large touch screen.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I looked at BMW, Audi, Lexus, and Mercedes in addition to Infiniti. The M35 with Sport pkg, Tech pkg, and advanced Tech Pkg came in near or below the "base" price of most of the others. The Navi system is among the more intuitive I've ever used, and the 14 spkr Bose 5.1 system is wonderful. The 19 inch wheels and Z rated tires take corners most cars would balk at without even chirping the rubber. The engine is great in most torque ranges, but could use a few more horses from a starting stop. The G37 engine has more power than even the M45's V8 - which makes no sense at all to me. I've only had the car for a month, but so far I am pleased with the purchase. It's a lot of fun to drive.</TEXT>
