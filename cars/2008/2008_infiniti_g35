<TEXT>This car was purchased from my company for $10,000 less than blue book. I had my eye on a sports car, but with a luxury look. This was it. I had an Infiniti QX56, but with gas prices, I just could not afford to let the tags, insurance, and now gas eat away at my pocketbook. This car is fun to drive. This car is awesome. My G35 Sport has the automatic/manual/paddle shifters on the steering wheel which makes this car more fun to drive. The only thing is that since I drive this car fast, I wish it had a bigger gas tank.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car used thinking that it would be the best car that I would ever own. It turned out to be ok, but was a big let down. Driving it off the lot I felt great I thought it was a reliable car for my wife. In the Arkansas rain my wife hydroplaned and ended up in on coming traffic. The so called traction that this car has is supposed to help it stay on the road but it doesn't and when the slip light comes on you are already all over the road I thought it was just my wife driving bought some $1000 tires to go on there to make sure she was safe and then it happened to me but I was able to keep control of the car. AC runs very loud.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I bought the G35 as a "retirement" car in anticipation of taking long road trips. We have been extremely satisfied with the comfort and convenience of this car. We particularly like the navigation system and other technology features, such as the color back-up camera and CD changer. This is our first "luxury" vehicle and we enjoy the feeling when we hand the car over to the parking attendant at our favorite upscale restaurants in Atlanta.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Super impressed with this car (so far)! We've owned Mercedes (S, CLK, & E - Class), Jaguars, and Audis in the past and are tired of paying $200+ for a key-fob!! Switched to Japanese for the reliability factor...and...there's not many of these on the road (vs. 3- series BMW! Quicker 0-60 than my 99' CLK 430!! Would have paid another 20K for a similar model Lexus! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car over a year and am still in that "new car love" with it. The 306 HP engine puts out TONS of power, so much it has turned me in to one of those people who speeds anywhere and everywhere. I have driven tons and tons of cars, and have never driven one this fast. As the dealer said, it is a sports car with a sedan body. The interior of the car is equally as stunning as the performance. All of the functions, including the navigation, are extremely easy to use. We love the iPod dock in the center console, as well as the ability to use an external flash drive to import music into the car's memory for playback. The seats are overly comfortable and roomy all around. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The performance of the car is amazing, as stated above. The handling is also amazing, and can easily make driving a heavy car on a windy road enjoyable. 18 inch wheels, period. Interior is stocked well with any feature you can possibly imagine. Paddle shifters + power = fun driving all around.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am very happy with this car. Solid ride, quiet, nice interior. Visually distinct lines on the car. Very responsive steering. Transmission shifts are smooth and close together. Coming off a 2003 Audi A6, the build and ride quality of the G35X seems much better. Averaging 20 mpg in mixed driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smartkey door unlock and push-button start. Integrated ipod adapter. Seat and steer wheel column move back when car is turned off for easy exit/re- entry. Comfy seats with nice leather surface.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been a Maxima guy for years and never thought I could afford a G. I've always liked the looks of the G35 so I decided to test drive one. It was all over after that. WOW is all I had to say. I bought the 08 early this year because of the rebates, only paid 32K for it with the Sport and Premium packages. I still have my 03 Maxima which I like alot but I let my sister drive it for now because I just can't see letting it sit (and sit it would as long as I have a car like the G). The VLSD (vicious limited-slip differential) and paddle shifters add to the FUN factor for sure. I'm 29 and feel like a kid in a candy store every time I get in my car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Just about everything. The power is amazing and handling just compliments it. Just step on it and hang on!! Stereo is great(Bose) and interior features are simple to use after you read what all you can do in the owners manual. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Everyone that is "in the know" about cars says this is the car to give the BMW 3 series "a run for the money". Rubbish. This car is quicker, sexier, and cheaper than its German counterpart. Plus, I haven't even got to the interior. Driving a BMW is like driving something an engineer built to a specification. Driving the G35 is like something a engineer designed and then an interior designer architect and artist redesigned. Its performance characteristics are superb, but more importantly, the car engages you. Its beautiful curves and attention to design and detail creates an experience. Remember, we (as humans) like things that look like us. The car looks like a supermodel.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling. The cabin creates a pleasant and engaging experience. Mad crazy amounts of power. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just hit the 5,000 mile mark and love the car more and more each day. I receive so many compliments on the car with most indicating that the car must have been very expensive based on it's looks. People assume this car was very expensive even though it's priced at or below the price of the vehicle they are actually driving themselves. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Absolutely fabulous, and a huge step forward from the 2003 G35 my wife drives. The interior is just below Lexus level, but not by much. The premium navigation/commmunications package is truly wonderful. The engine has rocketship thrust, even if it's a little unrefined compared to BMW, Lexus and Audi. I have been averaging 20 mpg on the highway, and am driving like a regular guy-- nothing too crazy, and not like Grandpa. If you can, get the sports package just for the seats if nothing else. Bar raised!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>One feature I like is the onboard hard drive; put in your CD and the music downloads to the HD. The CDs can then live in your living room not the car</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having owned 2 BMWs (3 & 5 series) along with an Audi allroad, I have a frame of reference to compare the German ownership experience with that of the 2008 G35 (sport, premium and navigation packages). Nothing can touch a Bimmer coursing through the S curves but my new G 35S is a powerful sedan that hopefully will provide years of satisfaction. This car is simply gorgeous and packs more technological features that cars costing many thousands more. I am very satisfied with my purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The G35S 6MT is one of the finest luxury sedans in its class, and, with attractive pricing comparable to the BMW 328, it certainly is closing the gaps in quality, performance and affordability. My G35S is fully loaded with aftermarket chrome detail work. Since my purchase I have been ecstatic and have woken up everyday with a smile on my face. The interior is exceptional in both design and comfort. With more standard luxury options and equipment than the 328, such as HID Xenon headlights, leather upholstery, and keyless entry with push-button start. Bottom line, if you can live without the prestigious German nameplate, the best value for your money is the Infiniti G35 Sport 6MT. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The standard luxury features that would cost extra money on other nameplates (BMW, Audi, etc.) such as leather seating and 18" premium wheels. The adaptive headlight system which synchronizes the wheels with the headlights. The V6 306HP, sport suspension, and best of all, the rear view camera.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm a little disappointed by my G35S. It's a great car with an excellent engine, nice interior, great exterior, all the gadgets and a posh sound system. But it has several HUGE flaws - horrible transmission and clutch! First of all it is VERY hard to launch it smoothly and quetly, too much throttle and it surges like a bull, too little and it shakes like its got an overdose. Let go throttle at 1st gear and instead of slow smooth engine braking you get uneven and abrupt deceleration, horrible feeling (and you look like a fool too). Second - very LOUD drivetrain noise. Third - under hard acceleration the car starts to shake violently, as the tires gain and loose the grip, very disappointing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I can't understand how did I live without the rear view camera before! A HUGE plus! IPod integration, POWER of course (could use a little more), brakes, interior design/materials, sound system, beautifull and supportive seats, amazingly direct steering, wonderful (but too muted) exhaust note. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the 2008 Infiniti G35 with the Premium/Nav/Sport packages. This is by far the most fun car I've ever had the pleasure to drive. From the excellently designed body to the excellently detailed interior, this car has it all. It has a wonderful balance of luxury and sport mixed together. The interior is fantastic with the sport package if you like the more modern feel. If you like the luxury feel more, I would not get the sport package because the seats are firm but very solid. If you want a better performance, you need to get the sport package. Either way, this car is such a wonderful balance of both worlds. Excellent car! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Driving/performance: This car has very tight and responsive steering. The throttle response is instant. Navigation and Tech Package are a must. So many options and features that add so much to this excellent designed interior. The navigation is some of the best I've even seen and so simple to use</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>AMAZING engine with immediately ready torque and speed. With this comes less than average fuel economy and that is ok, you can't have both. I think it's doing around 18 overall, and for those of you who ride about 5-8 mph over the speed limit, you'll be at 3200rpm at 75 mph. Like I said, it's the trade off you get for such a hungry engine. I'm not sure if a 6th gear would fix this, but I think that may make this car perfect. The tan leather with real wood trim is very rich looking. Easy to use nav & controls. Simply put, it's the most fun car I've ever driven and it's not even close - add Japanese reliability for icing on the cake. Bravo Infiniti.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>9 gig hard drive for music. This is simply the future of car audio - no more fumbling with cd cases. Exhaust note is almost arousing. Engine is simply amazing, handling is excellent while ride remains very good (18s with journey suspension is a perfect combination of comfort/sport), fit and finish.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my BMW 323i for this car and about the only regret that I have is that this car is a bit longer, other than that, what a car! It's also great that I got a great deal on it. You get so much for your money with this car. I got the Premium Package and the Nav. Package and think they're both great. I had debated buying the car without the Nav. package and then buying a portable device but I'm happy I went with the built-in as they tie in so many other things to it. Since I listen to music a lot I'm really happy with the music choices (iPod, Compact Disk, radio, or CDs). And this car has the power when you put your foot on the gas.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation system is great. The music system (with the Premium package) is also great. Love the iPod hookup. I've really gotten to like not having to hassle with the key; just leave it in your pocket and start the car, lock and unlock doors, etc.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got my 2008 Infiniti G35xS with the navigation and sport package along with a spoiler. I am coming from driving a powerful Mustang GT with a V8 and a lot of horsepower. And I must say this car is hands down my favorite car that I have ever driven. This was my dream car and I found a way to get it. This car packs more features then any car I have ever seen, and for the price completely knocks out BMW, Lexus, and Audi. I had test driven every single car in the class from the 325xi, Lexus IS350, Caddy CTS, and Audi S4. I have to say without a doubt the G35 is hands down the best car. Infiniti rocks!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything. Navigation, backup camera, CD burner, iPod connectivity, Bose sound system, comfort, power, internal HD, compact flash reader, dashboard, leather seats. You name it, and this car has it. Absolutely love the sound of the 306 horses growling!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just took delivery on a G35x with Premium package and nav. Although I have only put a few hundred miles on it so far, it is everything I expected and then some. I test drove a Lexus IS 250 AWD, a Lexus IS 350, an Audi A4 2.0T quattro, and the Saab 9-3 (just to name a few) and this car blows them all away in every category.

<TEXT>I traded in my 2002 BMW M3 2 door for the 2008 G35x Sport, needed a 4 door car for a baby. So far I really do like the car, and coming from an M3, the performance is right up there. Other cars I looked at were the BMW 335ix and Lexus IS350. Both were OVER $10k more expensive and the Infiniti had more features. I really like the interior of this car too, far more than the $10k more expensive BMW. Seats are very comfortable and it has a nice high-end look to it without the price. I think you cannot go wrong with this car for $38k, 300+ HP, great interior, nav, stereo, keyless start, etc.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased my 2008 Infiniti G35S Journey on 01/24/08. I don't have any cons to report except for the snug interior and narrow seats, but that's why they call it a sports sedan. This car ROCKS! It is very fast and a very attractive vehicle. I traded in a 2007 Maxima SE and haven't looked back since. My G35 turns heads and at takeoff will pin your head back. I wish I could find a raceway so that I can really stretch it out. I would highly recommend this vehicle for anyone who's in the market for a car well worth the money. It's cheaper than a Lexus and the BMW. Neither one of them compares as far as price and performance are concerned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Dealership brought out our 2005 TSX lease and looking for something with more torque and horsepower. Came down between TL-S or G35x, finally decided on a G35X w/sport package, premium pack, and nav. We didn't want to go through the rattling problem with Honda cars. Love the sporty look of the G35X with the 18" rim and the safty of all-wheel drive living here in jersey. So far no complain, we had three honda automobiles and this car feels much tighter build. No more rattle from my previous two cars (tsx and accord). Looking forward to drive it everyday. Can't wait pass the 500 break-in miles and let the throttle open on the highway. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an extremely sharp handling and undeniably quick sports car that just happens to have 4 doors and AWD. Though it may be a personal preference but pictures do not do justice to the lines and form of this car (like flowing water caught in an instant). Roomy inside (for this segment) and comfortable without excess. Premium and Navigation packages are a must. This is not a super-car but its highly capable and not overpriced. You can judge for yourself - definitely take a test drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>There is no better value in the "Entry-Level Luxury Sedan" genre than the Infiniti G35. I have the Journey trim with the Sport Package. Awesome. Better than I expected. Great ride, powerful, quick and a real head turner. Interior is beautiful, too. After looking at Acura TL, 3-Series BMW and others, there is really no comparison. Only downside is MPG. I am getting about 19 living in congested Washington DC spending 50% of time in "city driving" conditions. German manufacturers beware! The G35 delivers luxury and performance that Lexus and Acura cannot match.</TEXT>

<TEXT>G35 value beat A4, TL, Accord, BMW 3. Exterior design very seductive, except black patches in front air dam. Keyless locks/start button are amazing. Excellent interior design; quality and ergonomics. Driver memory system is awesome. Excellent fit & finish. Accelerator a bit touchy, but wow - love the torque. Handling is amazing. Ipod interface is just OK. Lighting scheme very cool. Tranny lacks refinement, with "thump!" from 2nd to 3rd under hard driving. Add a 6th gear: 70mph runs at 3200 rpms. Getting about 18mpg in mixed driving, 23 hwy at 75mph. This is a performance vehicle. Has room for improvements, but for $10k+/- less than Lexus IS350 or BMW 3, it can't be beat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I honestly wanted to purchase a BMW 325i; however, in the end I ended up with an Infiniti G35. Why? In a nutshell, the G35 is "The Ultimate Driving Machine." The driving experience is unmatched and the exterior as well as the interior are beyond belief. The exterior is well sculpted and the interior design is spectacular. The car handles like a charm. Monitor the speedometer at all times as it is easy to hit 100+ mph and not notice it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Break-in miles finally past, now I'm able to use the full RPM range and push handling limits! So far, flawless. The G35S feels light and nimble. Steering is very direct and engine flexibility (low rev pull) is great. Interior noise level is low, what I expect for a luxury sports sedan. Only quibble is a noisier than normal clutch, or just needs a bit more insulation. Stock RE050A tires grip very well, although won't last with that 140 treadwear. Interior materials seem durable and well designed. Comprehensive options nav, prem, tech, esp liked the superb driver's seat bolster adjustments. Fuel economy could improve though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In looking for a new sport sedan to purchase, I knew in the back of my mind that I would probably get the new G35. After I test drove it, it was a no-brainer. Everything that I was looking for in a car, and less expensive than other cars I was looking at. It looks good from any angle on the outside, with a roomy and quiet cabin on the inside. The center console is logically arranged, plus it looks awesome at night. The clutch is smooth and quiet, the shifter is short and sweet, and an excellent driving position is easily found with 12-way power seat. Back seat is roomy enough. Has plenty of technology if you opt for the NAV, PREM and TECH packages.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Finally pulled the plug on buying a new 2008 Journey with the Sport package, nav, premium. What a blast to drive and what a beauty to look at. Better yet, this probably is the most intuitively designed driver's cockpit that I've seen. My friends who have BMWs are still trying to learn how to work their nav while I'm burning CDs onto my in-car jukebox without a user's manual. Amazing! The best steering wheel you can imagine. If you're thinking about buying this car, do it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was all set to buy a 2008 Caddy CTS until a friend took me into the Infiniti dealership to look at the G35. Long story short, I bought the G35. The Infiniti is a superior product with excellent pricepoint, quality, reliability and longevity ratings. Mine is the Journey with Tech package, Premium luxury package, sport wheels and Rosewood interior. The combo of the Journey suspension with the 18 inch sport wheels/tire are the perfect balance for comfort and performance in my opinion. The satin finish on the Rosewood interior is very similar to the wood finish used in the BMW 7-series.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the Bluetooth phone interface, the nav system, and the voice recognition systems. The power is superb, especially at freeway passing speeds. The intelligent cruise control and adaptive headlights are also awesome.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It is really hard to find fault with my 2008 G35. I love the car, the way it drives, it's fit and finish and comfort. I would like to see better MPG than the 17.4 it averages around town. The engine has power, pleanty of power. The auto transmission is unbelievably smooth. The ride is solid. I'm very satisfied with the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Test drove the 335xi as a benchmark. It's a great driving car, but the inputs are all touchy and the interior made me feel claustrophobic, and it's pretty barren. G35 wasn't on the top of my list, simply because I've never cared for Nissan products in the past. But I told myself to give it a try, and boy am I glad I did. This car has a far nicer interior than the Bimmer, more features for less money, and achieves 95% of the performance without a turbo. Handling is spot on, although steering could use some work. Ride is firm, but body motions are well controlled and bumps are noticeable rather than jarring. This thing wants to be driven hard. I just wish we had no speed limit.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>306 hp, excellent transmission (for a slushbox anyway), bluetooth, iPod integration, musicbox, fantastic exhaust note.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Before everything else, test drive this car right away. It feels superior to drive and handles excellent. Gas mileage is surprisingly efficient. Driving with the 6 speed manual transmission is a little tricky as the car feels extra responsive to your every move so it can take a little getting used to even though I've driven a manual for years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been eyeing the G series ever since the first one came out. My 1998 Accord finally gave me fits, so it was a chance to hop into a G35. I had a great deal on the 2008 vs. a 2009 so I decided to pull the trigger. I love the interior, and the color scheme. The Premium package is a must. I like the G35S but at $2200 more, I decided to go without. I love the way it looks, and the manu-shifting is great. Not as instantaneous as a 6MT, but I rarely race, if ever. All in all, would definitely do it again. Didn't care much for the navigation (already have an awesome $200 Garmin) and the CF slot. With an iPod and an MP3 CD player, who needs CF?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been looking at the usual culprits in this class of vehicle for about 2 1/2 months now -- BMW, Lexus and Infiniti (both M35 and G35). I LOVED the G35 from the time I sat down until the time I left the dealership last! To get the MOST enjoyment from the car, I definitely recommend the Sport option for the added bonus of the seat upgrade! Granted the different sized tires may be a problem for some, but I have had to buy sport tires on my last 2 vehicles so am used to the cost! Regardless of some of the other "complaints" on the car, the gas mileage is a non-issue...unless you are coming from a Honda Civic or Mini- Cooper! 20 MPG city/25-28 MGH HWY is great for a PERFORMANCE SEDAN</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sport seats; NavTeq Navigation system is AWESOME (read the manual to find that all of the important controls are NOT locked out... use the VOICE feature); Xenon lights; Ipod adapter; the "growl" of the engine; the exterior lines of the car are seductive!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I admit I'm biased, I wanted the G since I saw the first photos of the 2007 model. I waited out the lease on my previous vehicle, then searched for more than a month to find a 6spd Sport. I live in upstate NY and took delivery in late November at the start of snow season; after nearly 2 months, I have no regrets about buying RWD. A set of Blizzaks all around, plus VDC and a light touch on the throttle and clutch, and I haven't had a problem at all. The G is everything I wanted; stylish, sophisticated, RWD, 6MT, with all the tech gadgets I could ask for. A friend rode in it and commented "Nice, but not a BMW or Audi." Which is exactly why I bought it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, intoxicating power, 6 spd, RWD. Sport model when every other G I've seen has X AWD. After a proper and excruciating break-in period of 1300 mi, I regularly get 20.2 to 21.1 mpg mixed city/hwy. Mine is Ivory Pearl with tinted windows; turns heads everywhere I go.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I looked hard at BMW, Audi and Infiniti when I was looking for a new car. Each had similar driving characteristics, but I ended up with the G35 because of the value of the content for the price. Living in Minnesota, the AWD feature was important, and the addition of the Premium, Navigation and Sport packages the price just couldn't be beat. Great linear acceleration with the right sounds. Sticky in the corners with the granny system on, but easy hang the rear out when you turn it off. Beautiful looks outside, nice inside. AWD is great in the winter with the all-seasons. The nav system is restricted from most functions when the car is in motion thanks to the lawyers - really annoying.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am writing this review after ~6 months of driving. I love the car and did a bunch of shopping prior to my purchase. I live in MN so an AWD or FWD vehicle was a must. I test drove the following vehicles prior to my choice of the g35x. Honda Accord Coupe, Nissan Maxima, Lexus IS250 awd, Lexus ES350, and Nissan Altima. The G35 was a combination of all the vehicles and really offers the power and luxury which could not be surpassed by any of the aforementioned vehicles. I drive in Minneapolis rush hour daily and the snow mode comes in quite handy when the weather takes a turn for the worst. I constantly try to lose control in this vehicle on secluded country roads and it's almost impossible.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is for people who love to drive. Acceleration is fantastic. Handling and braking are smooth. Very tight turning radius for a car this size. Road noise is a little more prevalent than in competitor's models, but not bad overall. You can feel the transmission shifts a bit. This car has a lot of power for a 5-speed. Likely corrected with the 7-speed in the '09. For me, the MPG has been trending at 17 over the first two months of ownership. I'm a little on the aggressive side, but previous cars haven't penalized me as much as this one does.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The design team paid such attention to detail, it's amazing. They truly make this car. The way the acceleration truly feels like a tidal wave as advertized, all of the buttons feel the same. Keyless entry and trunk. Snow mode is very good (I live in Chicago and have used it a lot this week.)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This G35S with summer tires would not survive in a snow storm. I'm battling with Nissan with a suspension, steering or tracking problem as this car is way too sensitive to road crown compared to every car I've driven, it drives straight in the right lane but would crash into the woods next to the left lane as soon as the hands are off the steering wheel, after alignment done on it 3 times, Nissan is refusing to acknowledge this quality defect while all 3 of their loaner cars I've driven drove without this problem, I would trade it in for an AWD especially living in the NE, a RWD just won't cut it in snow.

<TEXT>Hadn't planned on buying the G35 - always lusted after it, though. I bought an 06 325i. Frustrated, dumped it in 08, too many trips to the shop! Looked at the Maxima (never a fan, but liked the new look in 09) LOVED it, but couldn't pay $37K--more than the G. Drove the G, power kicks the 325. Who needs this sort of power? The brakes, lovely, the growl, exhilarating and no tranny lag when punched. Smooth, sure footed (though not as much on mountain roads as the BMW) and quiet. The drive train hump encroaches into the foot-well so front passenger's left leg/foot tilts at an odd angle. Front doors close solidly, rear doors sound tinny.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you get this car I highly recommend the Premium Package. It includes the completely integrated iPod hookup (Lexus does not), a sunroof, upgraded stereo, and more comfortable seats with the seat assist feature. My first car was a Camry so the 306 hp performance is a definite upgrade. I love being able to pass and merge at will. MPG has been 20 mpg so far vs 30+ with my 4 cyl Camry. This is not a full size car so if you are going to have frequent backseat guests you might consider something larger. A few of my friends have BMWs but they were very impressed with the look and performance of this car. For the money I don't think it can be beat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great looking car with good performance but my main reason for buying it was all the gadgets that come with the car. The problem is many of these gadgets get locked out while driving. You can't make changes to the navigation system while driving. How crazy is that! Where would you use your navigation system, in your driveway? The car allows you to sync your phone book from your cell phone to the car but you can't use the sync phone book to place calls while driving. When would you use this, in your driveway again!

<TEXT> The car handles extremely well, and unlike the general Edmunds' Review, I do not sense an artificial feel with steering; more of a euro steer feel. It also has great response and superb quickness. F&F quality is very high and as good as any higher priced lux vehicle I have seen. Cornering and sharp turns are spot on without any "pitch back", more like BMW. Only have 9k miles and only one criticism so far: the "studio on wheels" needs better radio/tuner component than current Clarion unit. High end is only average and mid-range sound is terribly weak. Whats more is the radio has no adjustment for mid- range. Unbelievable in 2008 with car stereo and market long matured.</TEXT>

Car handles great - not as responsive as the BMW but not a big difference. The graphical user interface is the best in the industry - the iPod interface is amazing and the Nav graphics are great and I love the rear back up camera. If you are considering the BMW 3 series you must look at this car, it will change your mind.

<TEXT>I'm happily in the honeymoon stage with my Journey edition. I came from an Acura TSX, and find that the G35 has less trunk and interior space. The gas mileage is bad, but I knew that up front; I'm also concerned about the summer tires and their longevity. Otherwise, I can't extol enough the rocketship engine and handling of this vehicle! The ride is amazingly smooth on the highway, but nice and firm at slower speeds and on twisty roads. Fit and finish is outstanding, and get lots of compliments on the look. I searched far and wide for wood trim (surprisingly hard to find!), and think it makes the cabin seem much more open and inviting. I look forward to driving to work every single day.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought it over a month ago and have been extremely pleased with it. I was initially in the market for the A4 and test drove it couple of times. Although the A4 drives well, the 08 model felt a little cramped even in the front. The Infiniti dealership was right next door, so decided to stop in to test drive the G35. Was sold on it instantly. Great handling and power, not to speak of luxurious and (relatively) roomy interior. Reminded me of my friend's 924 that I used to occasionally drive couple of decades ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The G is the most powerful sedan in its class, once you get over the overpriced BMW and over-rated IS, you will find the best performance, handling, and the most advanced Nav system on any vehicle at any price. For those of you who whine about fuel economy go buy a civic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Test drove many before I narrowed it down to the Acura TL and the G35. G35 was a much tighter drive and the exterior lines are much better and more unique. Only had for two weeks, but to date, I am very happy with the car. Was going to purchase the Blue slate but when I saw this in the sunlight it was too close to black. I thought Lakeshore was too light but it is perfect in person. Not too many running around town either. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently leased an '08 G35x, to replace my outgoing '06 G35x. I love both vehicles. The new G is slicker and more "refined"--the automotive press had complained that the previous version was lacking in this department. Acceleration is effortless at any speed, in any gear. Handling is tight and predictable. Some luxury buyers may find that the ride is a bit stiffer than they like. However, the G does not pretend to be a Lexus - this is a sports sedan. I've driven everything else out there, including various offerings from BMW, Audi, Lexus, Acura, Mercedes, etc. Hands down, the G is the best sports sedan for the money which is why I'm on my second one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, I am very happy with my G35. It is one of the most beautifully styled cars on the road, and it is really fun to drive. As a driver who spends almost all of his time in stop-and-go driving, the gas mileage is a little subpar (17-18 mpg in the city, but much better on the highway). I expected this, however, when purchasing this car. Overall, I am thrilled with my car and would recommend it to anyone who wants a laundry list of features in a reasonably-priced, luxury car.</TEXT>

The navigation is easy to use and accurate. I love the backup camera. It's great not having to dig in my purse to find my keys. I now have 10K miles and am averaging 23-24 mpg.

<TEXT>If you like a four door vehicle that combines performance, sport, luxury and all weather drive, the G35xS Infiniti is the best out there for the money. This vehicle turns heads and I'm always getting personal compliments about this "G". 0-60 in 5.4 seconds or better with AWD, V6 and 5 speed automatic/manumatic this vehicle is a thrill to drive. I do know cars and research them. You have my honest recommendation this vehicle rides smooth, handles very well, very reliable and safe. Real premium comfy leather seats, Bose sound system, excellent brakes and low cost maintenance this is the best upscale vehicle to own and enjoy everyday.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Step on the gas and this car takes off like it is jet propelled. The back up camera and navigation system are valuable assets and should be standard on every car.

<TEXT>I am very particular about certain things and my car is one of them. I traded in an 06 Honda Accord V6 for this 08 G35 Sedan Sport. I did a lot of research and test driving (Lexus IS 350, BMW 335i), but I was always partial to the Infiniti G35. I love the exhaust note!! This was a no brainer. The Lexus and Bimmer were $7k and $10k more respectively with the same options. I got mine fully loaded. The car has wicked acceleration! The quality of the materials inside the cabin are better than expected. The paddle shifters work great in manual shift mode. I recommend going for a test drive, but be warned... you will be hooked :-)</TEXT>

<TEXT>WOW! That is all I can say, this is my fourth Nissan product I've owned. When I was in the market for something new, I knew G35 was at the top of my list. I picked up a G35 X with the newly delivered Sport package. What an amazing vehicle. Tight suspension, steering, incredible features, fun to drive. Gas mileage is really bad but I don't care because every time I drive this car the smile on my face is priceless, acceleration is amazing and even though this car is extremely heavy, it hides it's pounds. Incredible styling, beautiful to look at. The best purchase I have ever made.</TEXT>

I looked in the marketplace, but could not find any other alternative that made me feel as good. There is no better feeling than walking towards my car, knowing how much fun I'm about to experience when the seats adjust to my preset position and I hit the ignition button. Handling on the X is as good as any sports car I've ever driven in. It's scary-fast, particularly when clearer with Bose technology </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car after trying the BMW 328i, the Lexus IS 350, the VW Passat , and the Nissan Murano. Let's just say there was no contest. The Passat and the Murano were nice but not in the same level, the Lexus was heavy and at times I almost had to shake the car to move, and the BMW though handled well, wasn't as much fun as driving this or even half as decently equipped. This car impressed me from the get go. It handled well on the curves and on the straight line. It is smooth to drive, and I can hit 75 effortlessly. The interior is extremely sleek, the Japanese finish is a nice touch and the seats are very comfy. The backup camera takes trust but it is easier than I thought to gain.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall a great car! The value you get buying this car over the Lexus IS350, BMW 335I, and Mercedes C350 is awesome. We got it fully loaded with the Tech, Nav, Prem, and Sports pkg. If you are looking for a fast car that has a lot of luxury for a better price than the others in this segment you can't go wrong. Cornering with the sports suspensions is amazing! You will feel all the imperfections of a bad road. Back seat has plenty of room for 2 teenage skinny girls, and car seat for my little boy. Be prepared for some envious people! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I comparison shopped for 2 months and compared equally-equipped vehicles. I looked at many cars in this luxury sedan category and narrowed down to the G35, BMW 335i sedan, and the Cadillac CTS 3.6L. To sum it up, the G35 was more bang for the buck, had a more luxurious feel when driving it, and looks absolutely incredible (mine is black). I love this car and have no regret.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation and the combination of luxury and sporty drive. I bought it with the premium & sport pack, this car is stunning, and handles like a coupe. It is the best purchase I have made in a long time. I have currently driven 6000 miles.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Trading in my 2005 G35 6MT that I upgraded from 298HP to 350HP for a 2008 G35xS was a bit concerning because I wanted the same horse power feel and was concerned the sedan would lack the 'feeling one' with the car experience. I also needed something for winter. I will say I'm really surprised by how responsive the automatic 306HP of the sedan deploys itself. Having said that, I HIGHLY recommend anyone getting this car to the G35xS, which adds the 18" wheels and the paddle shifters. I will say the car comes to life when in manual mode, much differently then just driving in automatic. With that I will say I'm quite happy and the car now provides the same confidence my previous G did.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the an 08xS in January of '08 and have since driven it back and forth to California. It is truly a great car. We also own a 2008 BMW 328xi and I prefer the Infiniti in daily driving, and even enthusiastic driving. Better overall performance, more comfortable, better and easier to control. The bang for the buck factor is a no brainer. Got every single option on the car for 39,500, and this is sport and AWD, with every package. Handled a snow storm in the Rocky Mountains outside Salt Lake City in January better than my old Jeep GC would have. Also is electronically limited to 130 mph (salt lake flats). Cannot recommend this vehicle more strongly. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove a lot of cars when i was shopping and this was by far the best car for the price. The Lexus or BMW didn't even come close to this car. I recommend the premium and navigation package. I got the sport package because I liked the look better of the vehicle, but I don't like the sport seats they're a little stiff and tight for me and I'm an average size guy. Over all this is a great vehicle. The handling and speed is what makes this car fun to drive. Make sure you test drive this vehicle before you decide on a new car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power and handling make this car great and a lot of fun to drive. I love the interior of this car, feels like your sitting in a cockpit. It's over whelming at first but the ease of use makes it amazing. The touch screen navigation is a must. I love the push button start and keyless entry system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Held off on commenting until I hit the 5000 mile marker. First interior is well done and attractive. However, I find the engine with the automatic is poorly done. The sport shift is comical with down shifts that don't make sense especially at lower speeds. Handling is ok, but not great, the review in edmunds is bang on - artificial. Brakes are spongy and translate road feel through the wheel which I find disconcerting. Fuel economy is brutal. I drive mostly highway and I haven't broken 18 MPG even with heavy use of cruise control. There is a reason why everything is compared to the BMW... it is far superior. Finish is suspect. Already have rubber coming off my driver side door. </TEXT>

The navigation and the rest of the electronics are wonderfully integrated and easy to learn and use. The screen is very bright and is useable even in sunny days. The 3 ways to control most functions (voice, knobs and touch- screen) make it fun abd easy to use under all conditions. The trunk access is too narrow, with a high barrier so that placing groceries and baggage is a hassle. Driver seat can not be pushed back enough for my frame (5'11").</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car really is an "underdog" when people first compare it to BMW, Lexus and other well known cars. But this car is fantastic! The Premium and Navigation Packages are a must when getting this car. The performace of this car is awesome. It's very fast and smooth at accelerating. I can get in and out of traffic when I need to. My favorite part of this car is the interior. It's very Modern but also has a luxury feel to it as well. The controls are very well laid out and look fantastic. I get so many looks in this car. I think it's much more sporty looking than the Lexus and also the BMW. All I can sy is make sure you test drive one when comparing to BMW? Lexus and you will see what I mean.</TEXT>

<TEXT>From the first time I saw this car at the dealership, it caught my eye. This sedan is well built and provides a classy but yet sporty look while delivering performance with a modern interior. The performance is awesome and so much fun to drive but what makes this car is the interior in my mind. It's not as luxury as the Lexus but it's 10K less too. It makes the BMW interior look childish. I would definitely suggest going with the Navigation and Premium Package. If you want a smoother/softer ride, don't get the sport package. But the sport package is nice and delivers in a great way. I guess it's all about what you want. All I can say is, go test drive one. Infiniti is here and with a great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test-drove TL, BMW 328/30, A4, IS 2/350 and decided that G35 fit our needs with the best price. I really wanted the RWD version but wife wanted the AWD (I also wanted the 6MT but wife cannot drive stick). Steering is slightly heavy at low speed. Fun to corner at the exit ramp and interior feels very luxurious with the luxury option and nav. Nav however tells you weird, roundabout directions. Bluetooth, nav, voice command work together nicely.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>306 HP, tight handling, iPod, bluetooth, nav w/XM traffic, Bose speakers, power-memory seats, autodimming mirrors, daylight sensors for interior/exterior illumination, dual climate control, keyless button entry, push start, voice commands.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Since I have a work truck, I wanted something fun to drive on the weekends. I always liked the G and even the I35s before it. The ride is smooth and responsive. I don't notice the wind noise people are talking about. The nav and controls are easy to firgure out.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the smooth ride and horsepower. Navigation is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First I drove the Lexus IS 250, Saab 9-3 Aero, Acura TL and S-Type, Honda Accord (v6), and Audi A4 (v6). ONE test drive in the G35x and it was a done deal! The dealer let me keep one over a weekend and I didn't want to give it back! Purchased the S option with paddle shifters. Talk about fun!! This weekend drove 70 miles to and from my father's house for the holiday: and if my wife had told me she left something (anything) back at my father's house I would have repeated the trip instantly just for fun!

<TEXT>I have owned quite a few sedans over the years and this one is my favorite by far. I just traded in my Dodge Charger R/T for this 2008 G35X (w/ Premium & Nav), and I have to say this sedan absolutley kills my dodge in every way (including performance). Being a computer consultant, I love all of the technology packed into the car. Voice commands actually work like you expect them to, the backup camera is awesome, iPod integration rocks. I could go on and on. Performance is great for a sedan like this. Faster than my hemi dodge for sure. The AWD is amazing and seamless. I feel like I'm driving a RWD with LOADS of grip. Much safer for my wife to drive in the wet and snow!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD - I almost insisted that I get the RWD version, but the dealer talked me into AWD and I dont regret it one bit. The system is RWD until slip is detected, the best of both worlds! Performance - 5.4 0-60, 13.8 quarter mile! What else can you say. Tech - nothing better in its class!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the G35x last month and absolutely love it. Smooth ride, all the bells and whistles, and the power under the hood still surprises me. Not the greatest gas mileage, but comparable to most competitors. Looked at the BMW 335i and the Lexus IS 350 and I have no regrets about choosing the Infiniti.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, phone and nav system with easy controls and voice control, comfortable and smooth ride</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wasn't originally looking for a car in this class but when I saw all the features I just couldn't help myself. I was looking for a fun sporty car and this is exactly that, but with a lot of luxury thrown in as well. It's comparable to the BMW 335i (better IMHO) in performance, comfort, and luxury. It has virtually all the luxury features of $50k+ luxury cars. If you're looking for a car that's fun to drive, the G35 is unrivaled. And it fits 5 people comfortably too! The clutch is stiff but easy to get used to. And I strongly suggest spending the extra 5k to get the nav. All the features that comes with it are awesome! I wish I got the tech package.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance! Fast, great handling, stops on a dime, 6-speed short shifter. Music hard drive, mp3, voice commands, bluetooth, completely keyless, windows can open with keyfob. The interior looks really fancy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just traded in my 05 G for a new loaded 08. Loved the 05 but the 08 is even better!! Feels more solid behind the wheel, nice more muscular look, and the 306 hp really gives you a buzz. This is the best mid-size sedan on the market, and for the money one of the best sedans period. This is my 5th Infiniti and never anything other than routine maintenance on the others. Expect the same on this one. Check this one out for sure!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>306 hp engine, push button start, sound system is great, performance tire package, good looking exterior, comfortable ride, hands free system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am so excited about this car. It offers a perfect combination of modern luxury with a perfect sport feel to it. The power is excellent and handles the road with ease. I can't say I test drove any of the other comparable cars but I didn't get that far because the G35 was the first car I drove and I was sold instantly. I went all out and got the Sport/Navigation/Premium package with the spoiler. I love the spoiler. It adds a perfect but not tacky touch. The technology is awesome and I feel like I'm in a space rocket. To me, this car looks best with a black exterior but that's just my opinion.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>By far my favorite feature is the whole interior. Absolutley amazing. Nice layout, quality materials and beautiful styling. I also love the navigation. It's one of the best I've seen and operated. Of course I love the keyless entry and and iPod hookup as well.</FAVORITE>
