<TEXT>Totally fun to drive even with Auto Tranny. Much more comfortable ride than regular Mini. Ride is best with 16"or smaller rims. Beautiful design grows on you alot with time. Was delivered with broken speaker that dealer has not been able to fix in 4 visits. Sunroof malfunctions sometimes. Alot of road noise on the highway. Radio controls are a joke. But I love this car beyond reason. Can hold lots of stuff but still fits in tight parking spaces in the city here in downtown Chicago. Even with little defects it's still worth it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The most fun car to drive on the planet, double sunroof, hot chocolate (brown)paint and interior, double back doors. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Most fun I've ever had behind the wheel of a vehicle! This car is tight, quiet, and does whatever I ask of it and asks for more. Turns like it's on rails. My wife called me when driving it for the first time, and asked how to turn on the cruise control, because she was doing 90 MPH and didn't realize it. I'm outstandingly pleased with my purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dynamic Stgability control is amazing. I've executed 90 degree right turns at 40mph wihtout touching the brakes in rainy conditions!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking for a reliable comuter car and looked at the Honda Fit, Nissan Versa, and the Clubman. Of the 3 the Mini offered the Get-Up-&-Go I was looking for with the "S" model. I test drove both models on the AutoBahn here in Germany. What really sold me was the turbo, in both 5th & 6th gear the pick up to get around other vehicles was very impressive. I also tested the fit for my Rottie with the rear seats down she has enough room to move around realitively comfortably. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I have all 4 packages on mine, but the feature that I like the most is the cold winter options from the heated seats to the heated windshield jets.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked this up in Kansas city and drove it home 7 hours. It has amazing torque and cornering. Very comfortable for road trips, with firm seats and real lumbar support with the upgraded upholstery. It does have a very firm ride, and the sport package is only for masochists. I plan on switching out the run flats when they wear out with regular tires to ease the bumpiness. The roads here in Minnesota are bad. If you can find a twisty road it is sublime. I test drove all the varieties, and I think the Auto base is a bit underpowered. The Manual base is ok. Obviously the S in either version rocks. But switch the MPH over to the RPM gauge, as I hit 100 when passing without noticing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The look and feel of the car. It is a little rally car. The torgue boost is quite impressive. The cloth/leather seating is a great deal if you are building your own, as it includes color line and interior surface choice, usually running $500, so it is $500 over that. And it has Lumbar support.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The kids are driving themselves and the family minivan was getting old. When gas hit $4/gal I wanted to drive something with better gas mileage. We have a Camry Hybrid which is fuel efficent and boring. I wanted something more fun and the Prius wasn't going to cut it. Once I drove the Clubman I decided it had the size I needed and the fuel mileage and fun factor I wanted. I'm getting 36 mpg overall and 42 on the highway. Probably should of bought the "S" model but I wanted gas mileage. I had I known gas would be cheap again I would of bought the "S" Model.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling is great. Great looking car and with the rear barn doors has good storage/truck capacity. Back seats are big enough for normal sized passengers. Quality feel to the car inside and out.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> I've had pickups of various sizes and even really enjoyed the Toyota FJ, but when I was putting a tank of fuel a day through it, I had to make a change. With the flat rear deck, I can get two dog kennels gear and hunting buddy in it, and hunt all day on peanuts. The ground clearance, ride and slippery conditions limit its access, but it sure is great to get around in. Actually got a 1000kms to a tank once.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lounge leather seats that I would like to remove and keep for every vehicle I own next. Keyless entry and start. 10 speaker Stereo. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>S Clubman</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>The steering is direct, suspension is stiff, road and engine noise is evident in the cabin, not a smooth ride -- absolutely the best car I have ever driven! I went from a Pathfinder to a Mercedes C to a Clubman and it does not dissapoint. It comfortably fits a car seat for my daughter at the back with one other person. It handles snow really well in Toronto even with stock run-flats. Road feel is great just the way a performance car should be. If you don't want road/engine noise and want a soft ride, go get a camry. But if you want a reasonably priced, fun-to-drive, dare I say it, practical car, the Clubman's for you. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dual sunroofs give the cabin a airy feel, handling, fuel economy, sound of the turbo even at low rpms</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love everything about the car from the inside-out. Pickup on steep hills could be better. Navigation is great and looks so much nicer than the standard speedometer and the back-up camera for me was a must. The upgraded stereo system sounds great. Felt the sunroofs weren't dark enough so I bought 4 tinted window spots from Axist (2 in front & 2 in rear) and now they're tinted the way I like them, from a person who suffers from skin cancer. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Being able to customize the interior color scheme (red & black) to match the exterior. Everyone comments on the sporty look with the chrome foglights and black sport stripes. My neighbor says it suits me. Love the 31.6 mpg with plus gas - beats my BMW 330XI that got 20.9 mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Moved away from European to Japanese now back to Cooper. Great Car! Really have trouble keeping it at legal speed. Getting ready for first trip, 600 miles, can't wait. Traded in a Miata for this, don't regret it at all.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>One button to open windows and sunroof. A/C works great. All controls are simple to use.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Mini does it right. A gas sipper that is actually fun to drive! On top of that the Clubman is stylish. Great to drive, top of the line brakes, head turner, good safety features, great gas mileage, highest resale value, best warranty by far. What else do you need to know...excellent options available altough at a cost. You can truly make the car feel as though it suits exactly you.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my MINI. It's a blast to drive. I'm getting about 32 MPG with the auto. transmission in mostly country road-type driving. Good surprise: We fit 3 adults, a teenager, a goalie hockey bag and five medium-sized grocery bags in the car for a one-day round trip, 3 hours each way, & it was comfortable, even in back, and rear visibility wasn't blocked! The car is very well engineered but had some minor defects when delivered (not a surprise), which are still being fixed after 5 weeks (a surprise). The biggest surprise is that the car is a fantastic highway cruiser! It's amazingly stable at high speeds. You don't feel the speed, so you need to be very careful that you don't go 90 in a 55!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sirius satelite radio with 10 speakers, Bluetooth, Ipod interface, auto climate control, dual sunroof, cargo room with the rear seats up or down, hidden dashboard storage (you need to check it out), surprisingly powerful, great-sounding, small engine without the turbo, & digital cruise control.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I transitioned from a 2006 Mini Cooper S to the 2008 Clubman S, and I am really pleased with the Clubman overall. The turbo charged engine feels more robust and smoother compared with the prior years, and the improve fuel economy is wonderful. Overall my mileage on my 2006 (manual 6 speed) was around 29 mpg for all types of driving. With the new Clubman (manual 6 speed) I am averaging around 33 mpg for all types of driving. This is wonderful for such a high performance little engine. The extra space is terrific, and the build quality is better overall than my 2006. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine performance and smoothness are great. Get the run flats! Ignore comments about ride quality and noise with run flat tires. They are a safety item. Period. No car should be without them. Every time I see someone beside the road on a freeway, I think ?That will never be me.?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wow - feel like I'm dealing with the emperor's new clothes here. I do not like this car at all. Special ordered it from England, waited months and am incredibly disappointed. Sure, it handles nice but it's incredibly noisy (run flats), obnoxiously bouncy, shifter throw is excessive, build quality seems pretty awful - less than 1000 miles and driver's window is stuck down, rear doors misaligned on delivery, tire pressue warning stuck on, side scuttle emblems fallen off, finish on $750 extra wheels pitted and corroding; cup holders awkward & too small, interior storage awkward. Info center controls unneccessarily complicated. I really wanted to like this little car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good mileage (31mpg)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love this car. Don't get the runflats unless all-out handling is your only goal. The regulars are much more quiet and the ride comfort is vastly improved. And you get a spare. With the regular tires, this car is luxury car quiet on the highway, stunning for a little car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The rear doors: only people who do not actually drive this car complain about them "blocking the rear view", as the door jam becomes virtually invisible when you drive because it doesn't totally block anything.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Highly recommend the Clubman. Great on gas mileage (drove to Reno NV and back from San Francisco on one tank), and is a very cool looking vehicle, to boot. I never cared about cars or driving before, but now I look forward to simply driving to the dentist! Perky and smooth ride at once. My dog fits in the back as does my 6'4 boyfriend in the front. Also, as the Clubman is new, it is a head-turner. I can't leave a parking lot without people drooling over it and asking me questions! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Barn doors, split suicide door, "Rooster red" leather trim highlights inside door and dash, smooth drive, responsive, feels bigger inside than it looks from the outside. Cool car all around.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Clubamn is an excellent drive. Use for business, wanted regular Mini S but tools would not fit. Clubman gives plenty of room. Great mileage, even with super unleaded. Drive 400+ miles on a tank of gas. Hard to stuff more than 12 gallons when empty. Fun to drive, have to be careful not to get too fast, ride is so smooth that speed can get away from you.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Absolute joy to drive, in fact right after I bought it from the dealership and literally the first trip on the freeway- I got to test out the handling right away in order to dodge the remnants of a tire blowout on the freeway. Car handles tight and has nice "giddy-up". I would strongly recommend this car. I looked at all others in its class and this one really is in one all by itself. The ride is quiet too, now I just need to get it back from my wife. Overall it is a very well thought out and detailed oriented car. I look forward to driving it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My absolute fav feature is the ability to customize this car inside and out. "you-ify it" they call it. Additionally, the little touches are nice like the ambient light toggle. Get the multi function steering wheel and ipod/bluetooth - the convenience package is well worth it. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I went from my fun 2003 Cooper S to what feels like a luxury car! Hot chocolate with heated leather seats and wood finishes. It is so beautiful inside I just want to drive around all day. The extra room in the back is great and the rear barn doors get a lot of attention. This car is fully loaded and I get so many people stopping me it is incredible. I've been getting 26 mpg in Los Angeles traffic. (I have an automatic and prefer to drive in sport mode.) If I was a more conservative driver the mpg would be higher.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior led "disco" lights set to your mood. Bluetooth phone on steering wheel. Huge sunroof. iPod connection. Brown leather seats with cream piping. All the attention I get.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my 06 Mini Cooper S for a Clubman S because I had a baby. Now the whole family can ride in the car together even with a rear facing car seat. The car is a lot of fun to drive. Great on handling. Also getting 29mpg can't beat that. No compliants at all. Best car I have owned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is the sweetest car I've ever driven. I can honestly say that I don't know if I'll buy another car unless it's a MINI. It's one thing if I need a truck though. This car is fun to drive and you always get looks from people as you drive through the parking lot or are out on the highway. Windows rolled down almost always because people ask what is that you're driving. Has lots of room. I'm 6'7" and I have no trouble fitting in the tiny little car. It seems very safe as swell with the inside of the car acting like a bubble pillow if they go off because there are so many air bags. Traded in a Pontiac Aztek for the Cooper. Would do it again if I had to! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are the led lights all over the interior and the heated leather seats. I've always wanted some so I got some. Gotta have the sunroof for sure! It's way huge! Definitely gotta get the racing stripes on it so people know you mean business. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wow! What car can you get with BMW fun, BMW luxury, nimble size, and super gas economy (30mpg mixed driving), all in one, for under $30K? Trade in a fully loaded '04 Accord, and got a fully loaded (minus GPS) MINI Clubman. It has a vintage, classy look, and is fun to drive. Also feel very safe in the car... in control, connected to the road, and solid. Can park anywhere. Love the paddle shifters, provides power when needed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turning. Oh, and the mileage, luxury and fun. But really, the handling is awesome. Interior lighting is pleasant. I like the character of the interior layout. Ergonomics take a little getting used to, but I wouldn't change it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only had this car less than a week & I think I'm one of the first ones to have this car in the area, as I have not seen another one on the road yet. MINI is keeping the demand high by not keeping a lot of these in stock at the dealers (at least in San Diego), which is great for resale value. This car is a blast to drive, is built with BMW quality, and is oober-styish. Must have options are bluetooth & IPOD integration, and the dual pane sunroof. I've been getting about 29 1/2 MPG as a commuter with the manual transmission (still on first tank of gas), but I can easily see getting 35-40 on highway trips (I put it on cruise @ 80 and the current MPG monitor was reading 40+). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive, handling, interior quality, sunroof, push button start, style & looks, IPOD & bluetooth integration, MPG, 5 color ambient lighting, sport mode, bang for the buck, barn doors, 3rd door access to back seat</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Mini Clubman is a great vehicle. The original Mini was great, but lacked size to take your golf clubs to the course and god forbid if you had to have someone in the so called backseat. Well the Clubman is the answer. Comfortable fit golf clubs in the back, and plenty of room for 4 when needed. Ride is better than Original Cooper. It is a fun sports car when you want to turn it on. Sport mode adds to the fun to have ready on power. Through daily commuting of 75%/25% highway to city, I have averaged 32 MPG with the automatic. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the performance to fuel milage ratio, 32 MPG average. Cool rear doors opening, duel sunroofs, and BMW quality through out. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great vehicle. I always wanted a Mini but needed to be able to transport my two boys in the back. The Clubman was the answer. Excellent pick-up; excellent grip; great 6 speed tranny; and you gotta love the barn doors in back. Gas mileage is, of course, great; 28 city and 33 highway. The ride is also much more secure and settled on the hwy with the longer wheelbase vs the Cooper coupe. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sport package/S engine combo; slick 6 spd; the looks (lightning blue with silver C pillars); cool barn doors; helpful 3rd door; Double pane sunroof; the MINI experience, tough to describe unless you're an owner!</FAVORITE>
