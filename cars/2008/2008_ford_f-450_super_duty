<TEXT>I had originally reviewed this truck well over a year ago. Since that time I've had the rad replaced twice and then a loss of power problem. Ford replaced the fuel pump, but that didn't fix the problem. After 6 months of back and forth they finally figured out it was the high pressure pump. Towing a 18K lb trailer was a challenge on a recent trip when the truck kept losing power. Thankfully they finally fixed it! I have to admit, Ford did help out in the way of giving me a rental vehicle and covering everything under the Powertrain warranty. But would I buy another one? Nah. Should have gone for one of those Freightliners!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very nice features. Nav, 6 disc player, leather seats... all the bells and whistles!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>63K miles - 4th time in the shop for major repair. Latest adventure 1 week to replace fuel pump, WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU HAVE TO REMOVE THE CAB TO GET TO IT? This truck was not designed to be maintained. Change fuel filter every other oil change ($$$$). Regular tire shops cannot change or rotate tires (???). This truck is not one of Ford's better ideas.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fully customized truck - love the looks, love the ride, love the interior. HATE the cost of ownership. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I use this truck every day to tow various trailers for work and pleasure. From a 6 ton travel trailer to 2 jet skis on a trailer, towing is simply amazing. I had the same radiator problems everyone else seems to have had but mine was fixed in a day at the dealer. Perimeter lights on the bed fell out constantly but those too were fixed and have been ok since then. The 80mph governor was a surprise but I read it has to do with the stock tires. It has been terrific advertisement for my company and a great work horse- I've tugged a semi out of a ditch with it, no problem! Upgrade to the "Banks Combo" for more HP and better efficiency, 15k will get you a lift, new wheels and tires to die for!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is ridiculously nice for a work truck. Power EVERYTHING. The power mirrors are great as you can fold them in or out and extend them with a touch of a button. The exterior is sexy, you will definitely turn heads. The towing capacity and power is what makes this truck stand out.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've got just over 20,000 miles. The fuel mileage is pathetic at 8.4 mpg average (about 7 towing and 9.5 not). It's been in the shop to many times to count. 3 radiators, water pump, idler pulleys, thermistats, wheel bearing, etc. It ruined our last vacation by being stranded in a tiny desert town for several days.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Pulls well, turns good for a big truck. High towing capacity.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love my truck, Job 1, Have had it for almost two years and only minor issue, Radiator leaked, Dealer fixed right away. I tow Horses and 5th wheel up to Utah & Northern New Mexico and Colorado with no problems. Love to pass those Chevy's and Dodge's.I love to drive this truck. Pulls better than my 99, 01,(7.3's) 07,(6.0) f-350's I use to have. Mileage could be better but getting better as the motor breaks in. To date getting 14.5 off the hook and 12 on it, Use synthetics and getting better. But this thing is made for pulling and thats what I do with it. If you want a truck to haul Groceries dont buy this truck! if you need to pull loads all the time this is the TRUCK! Overall love this Truck</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>POWER!!!, LOOKS, Turing radius, Comfort, Love the 19.5" rims & tires, Rides like a Lincoln, Solid as a bull! No squeaks or rattles to date! Plenty of room. Love the DVD player & nav. To DRIVE this truck! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have the King cab and have people looking at it, asking all kinds of questions and commenting on its good looks every week. The truck is a super hauler, looks great, fun to drive (Wife claims its her's) and is a perfect combination with our 40' toy hauler.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy to drive, hauls every thing and is super comfortable. This plus outstanding dearship support we enjoy makes it a truly outstanding truck. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the King Ranch and love the interior. The stereo and nav system are great and I also like the braking. The heating system is excellent and love those heated seats. Really like the low noise diesel engine. Power loss on hills while towing is to be expected but not to s only 11,000 miles on it, I still only get 7mpg hauling and 9.5 in town. 488 gearing robs the mpg. Truck has been takien to the dealer's numerous times because it doesn't feel or sound as though it's running correctly. I'm always told it's fine. I'm waiting for the big "Kaboom!" The governor's got to go and the exhaust system needs a complete over haul.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>King Ranch package. Like the towing capacity and the look of the truck. Comfort during 15 hour hauls is a plus.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When it works it is a good truck. In '07 hauling horses and 40 footer it stranded us on the road in Oklahoma. Two weeks, two dealers later it was supposedly fixed. Broke again on the way home. Right now it is in shop in North Carolina. Stranded again on road in Nebraska. Fixed then broke again in NC. Replace injector 1 three times, and elect module once. This truck has been towed to shop four times. When we get it back .... sold.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one big truck! We purchased this so we can tow our 40' toy hauler. The 1 tons won't do the job. The quality of this truck is impressive.The 6.4L diesel barely makes a sound and the interior is amazing! Navigation, rear DVD for the kids, 6 disc CD, wow! This truck handles and feels like a car but you're above the traffic and know you're in a truck. Ford made the right choice to make a commercial truck into a heavy duty hauler for a family. More people are buying large 5th wheels and this is the natural choice. And I know I made the right one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, power, navigation, comfort, it's all good. Some people complain about the fuel consumption. Sure it's not great, but this is a commercial vehicle. I get over 13 MPG, very acceptable for the size and weight of the vehicle. It can tow up to a 24,500 lb 5th wheel , ours is only 18,000</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have 17,500 and love the truck. Interior is beautiful and convenient. Can ride for days and feel fresh. Pulling a 40 ft horse trailer with 8- 10 horses. Have no problem with power. Gas mileage is where I expected it. 10 to 15 mpg hauling 14 to 17 off hook. Notice a big difference in mpg from 55 to 65. No problems so far. Prior truck was gmc 3500. No comparison.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ford decided not to honor their warranty because the truck had been abused... Even though all the proper paper work was given to them of all the oil changes. The engineer would not accept that the oil and filter had in fact been changed. All this goes back to the engine.. Smoking and over heating from the beginning. Apparently the fix did not fix it. Any one else having problems with Ford over warranty issues? I guess they will have it towed back to my house.. (another $400 for towing) unless I let them fix it for $5,000 dollars, and there is no way unless the money falls down from the sky!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my F-450 for a year and have had zero problems. I tow a trailer that weighs in at 11,000 lbs empty, and 24,000 + lbs loaded. It handles the loads easy, has plenty of power to keep it moving up big hills (Grape Vine, Pacheco Pass). The Tow Command system is incredible with seemless, smooth braking and downshifting to get you stopped in a hurry. This truck rides excellent, interior is beautiful and comfortable. The sound system is top notch. My fuel mileage started out low; about 7.5- 8.0 mpg towing and 9.5- 10 mpg empty. When I hit 15,000 miles the mileage took a jump to 9.5 mpg towing and 14 mpg empty (driving at 70 mph with 4.88 gears). Bottom line, I love this truck. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stability under load, superior comfort and handling, great looks and convenience features (tailgate step and handle, to name one). Commercial tires and wheels. Tons of power to pull whatever you want.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>14750 miles and 34 days in for repair - ABS problems, cooling problem, loss of power, light bulbs falling out, hub caps falling off, can only use 33 gallons max of the 38 gal tank, 5.1 MPG towing 10,000lbs, 80MPH max speed.. This vehicle has to be the worst I have ever had experience with. I used to put 100,000 mi/yr on F350s and if I was still towing like I was then I would be out of business. Now because of 5MPG towing and 8.5 empty, I can't afford to drive it. On top of it all, Ford will not stand behind it and I am out of luck..</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I Like the 6100 lbs bed capacity and the tight turning radius. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In January of 08 I bought an F450 for hauling cars. The first thing I noticed was that I was getting around 6.6-5.0 mileage while towing! My best friend has 07 Dodge & a Chevy and he's getting around 8-10. The next thing is after putting 10,000 miles on it it's been in the shop 2 different times for egr values and a busted radiator! I have 4.10 gears in it I'm looking to swap them out for some 3.73's to get better mileage, if I can get the thing out of the shop!</TEXT>

<TEXT>For the people that want a real truck this Ford F-450 is the one for you. The power this ford has is unbelievable, easy to drive, comfortable, you can sit in this truck for 14 hours and feel like you're ready to go again. Looks like a truck and drives like a car. I can haul a full load of horses in a live in trailer and not even know its behind me. For all you people that talk about the truck being too big buy a smaller one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded up from a 2000 F350 with 50,000 miles. The 08 F450 is a much better riding, and driving truck and the King Ranch package can't be beat. It definitely has more power then the 2000, and the suspension is amazing - I have a Lance 1181 camper that's 4000lbs dry weight in the bed and the truck hardly sits down with it on there. But here's the no! with only 5500 miles on the truck and easy hauling it has been in the shop for more than six weeks with transmission problems, over heating issues and now it's starting to chug and act "weird" intermittently. Boy, I hope I haven't just given up reliability for comfort!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>King Ranch package, the looks, the pickup an power, the load capacity, the ride compared to the old bumpy trucks, cab heater and navigation are sweet too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased my 2008 F450 on a Tuesday, had the 5th wheel installed on Wednesday and left for the Florida Keys on Friday with 450 miles on the truck. We pulled the 40 foot toy hauler with 3 Harleys in the back, estimated 18,500 pounds and had no problems running in the tow haul mode. Great truck, but it does like a gallon of fuel. We averaged around 7.3 MPG on the trip of about 3,000 miles. My truck has 4.88 gears and turns about 2500 RPM at 65 miles per hour. We ran with the cruise on 70 most of the time. the truck now has about 8,000 miles on it and we love the truck except the mileage. We get about 11.5 MPG around town.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Said I would never own a pickup. Seems to be a very very nice tow vehicle. Perhaps one of the very few that doesn't wear on you when travelling long distance. Fit and quality seem excllent. Brakes and wheels are awesome. Mileage is 12-13 around town, 15-16 on the interstate, and 10-12 when towing a 10,000lb Airstream. As long as you remember its intended purpose, you'll love the truck. I had zero problems so far, and have 7200 miles on it. I highly recommend this tow vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning 4 GMT800 duallys and after researching the new GMT900 dually, I made the switch to Ford. Solid front axle, truck like dash, and heavy duty frame and components instead of GM's IFS were key to my decision. Not to mention a host of other nice features. GM's new lineup have left a lot of customers like myself out in the cold and they will switch to Ford like I did. This truck is solid, rides better than my '05 3500 4x4 GM dually. It gets more looks and thumbs up than my H2. I just have to get used to the solid front axle bump steer, unlike the bolted to the road GM IFS. To sum it up, if you want a commercial grade tow vehicle with Cadillac features, this truck is for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Amazing Truck. Moved up from an '03 F-350 w/ v10 auto. Interior looks like something from a luxury car. Smooth ride, ultra quiet, motor has plenty of power to move this 8300 lb. truck. Yea it costs a pretty penny, but well worth it if you need a truck that will tow. Only buy this thing if you need to tow more than 8 tons, it's a luxury work truck and not a hybrid.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First few days of ownership. Overall fit and finish: excellent. Rides amazingly well even without load. Super-quiet, comfortable interior (King Ranch). Complicated, but very capable nav system. A dream to drive with great acceleration (for an 8700# truck), excellent cornering (incredible turn radius). Prefer over the Duramax GMC.</TEXT>
