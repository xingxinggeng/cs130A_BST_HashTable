<TEXT>We have had this car for about a year and a half. It rides well, drives well and has been reliable. Only two complaints. Windshield is very poor quality and breaks with the slightest touch of a pebble. Leather interior is mostly vinyl. After a small tear, I found that the only part of the seat that is leather is the small section in the middle of the seat surface. The entire rest of the seats including the bolsters on the seat surface are made of vinyl. No happy about paying for leather and not even getting full leather seating surfaces! Contacted Subaru and they told me that customers like vinyl better. Sounds like a way for Subaru to save money!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I usually don't write any reviews, but this car is so bad, I thought I owed you (the reader) some advice. Don't buy this car. We bought ours new, and the engine eats oil. Dealer said the engine was 'breaking in'. I am now at 20k on the car, and it eats 1.5 to 2 qts per 1000 miles. Dealer will not help. Also, the A/C is weak. It is barely ok for the front, but on a 5 passenger, there is no rear air. My kids hate it, always hot. Numb steering, brakes fade easily, 'manual' shift is poor when upshifting, interior clunks and rattles like a 30 year old Ford. There is lots of room for improvement, here. Once bitten, twice shy. There, I warned you.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD is nice, but you are lucky to get 20mpg highway; styling is so bland, you are invisible to cops, but sadly, also invisible to cute girls.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the car in April of 08, and just hit 27k miles. Small gas tank, but mileage not bad for an SUV. The fit of the interior of the car is disappointing, loose pieces every where, & the rear hatch is not designed to strategically close when packing. Also, what is the point of the rear blower if I can't control it from the front, my kids cant reach it. The look of the car is great, but I can't justify the looks versus the quality I expect for the prices. A+ on the handling and engine (although Subaru wants me to change the tranny fluid already)! C on interior quality and pointing out as another post did, who scans on the radio any more, let me change my presets from the steering wheel</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All Wheel Drive in the North East is key! 23 MPG highway, good acceleration. Sliding second seat with recline.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love everything about this car - except two issues that I've had. I have a "phantom" energy drain that leaves me stranded due to a dead battery. It's random, unpredictable and frustrating. I also have had to have the power steering fixed twice - they actually needed to put a new pump (?), regardless, at such low mileage I'm surprised.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the interior of this car. The dashboard is beautiful and I think it has more features/gauges/lights and style than the other two cars I looked at, Cadillac SRX and Lincoln MKX.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased our Tribeca about 18 months ago, and rated it very high. All of that has changed after being stranded 3 times and numerous trips to the dealer who can't or won't resolve the problems. From the beginning there has been a noise in the engine that the dealer and factory reps hear but can't pinpoint, so it goes unrepaired, also it burns oil but not enough to meet their oil consumption criteria. The steering column locks up, and has stranded us three times, you have to beat and bang on the column to unlock it, the tow driver taught me that, and because you can't duplicate the condition, they can't repair it. This is our first Subaru and it will be our last. Maybe we got a LEMON?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have 12,000 on my Tribeca, and have been very happy. I was shopping for an SUV w/ 4WD/AWD, good reliability and resale, and wanted some luxury appointments (leather, 6 CD, etc) for not much over $30k. I chose the Subaru over all others in class as I was able to get most everything I wanted without having to compromise too much. The inside and exterior styling are very unique, and the interior is more luxurious and sharp looking that the other cars in class. I've had the car for close to a year and have been very impressed. The AWD system is fantastic in the Iowa winters. After having ridden in all of them, I'm happy I chose this over Pilot, Highlander, 4Runner and Edge.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD system is great; unique interior; head and shoulder room for driver is fantastic (I'm 6'1"); ease of rear seat folding; not everyone has one; puddle lights are a nice touch; iPod jack; 18" wheels are great; comfy/supportive seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I leased this vehicle for my sons who went off to school. This is a solid vehicle with excellent safety ratings. It is a substantial vehicle that handles whatever the weather brings. In 3 years mileage will be up substantially for all manufacturers when it it time for a new vehicle. What sold me was the overall passenger room, the styling and safety features. I have not regretted the lease for even a moment. I wish that I were driving it instead of my kids. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our Tribeca in Aug. of this yr. and really love it, with a few exceptions. We took a 3600 mile trip up the east coast (being demo it already had 5600 miles on it). Well, on the way home from our trip a rock flew into the a/c condenser and all the freon drained out. I can't believe that there is no protection from flying objects. The cost to repair it was $1080.00! We were shocked about this and had file on our insurance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the Tribeca since April 2008 and put almost 6000 miles on it so far. The handling of the AWD Tribeca is darn near neutral and the turn in spot on. its fun to drive and comfortable on road trips or in town. The interior and exterior looks compliment each other. I use the transmission in sport mode all the time, either leaving it in drive or shifting up and down. the engine is a lot more responsive & mileage doesn't seem to suffer. One thing that bugs me is that the transmission shifting seems out of sync with the engine at times. The Tribeca doubles well as a tent and carries a lot of "stuff". I don't like the puddle lights though but that's a nil point IMO. Next thing is XM radio.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 08 Tribeca is a mix of great features and questionable design components. The Tribeca is solidly built and handles like a car. The engine is powerful, and the transmission shifts smoothly. Steering and braking are crisp. The cargo area is surprisingly small for a vehicle this size, a tight fit for dogs. The gas mileage is poor (17 mpg mixed) compared to other vehicles in this category, and is compounded by a small gas tank which results in a VERY, VERY short driving range. I was spoiled by my 06 Outback's 500 mile range. The thick A pillar makes turning corners a challenge if pedestrians are present. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Last car was a BMW X5. At first I thought the Tribeca was on par. NO way! Have had a number of mechanical issues which my dealer does not know how to fix -- front left tire loses air, center console foam compressed, high pitched noise at certain speeds. Subaru has shown no interest in addressing my issues. I was looking to install blue-tooth which is not a factory option. The proprietary cd/radio has made that challenging. Lots of noise in the cabin while driving. The ride is not as firm as the BMW X5. The back-up camera is a very nice feature and the heated seats work well. The less than 16 gallon gas tank is way too small. Gas mileage has been 15 city 18 highway. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased vehicle 7 months ago after much deliberation and was extremely happy with my choice. I understood the shortcomings: no telescoping wheel or bluetooth, small gas tank and 19-23 mpg (not bad considering AWD). However after I had the oil transmission cooler installed, the transmission hasn't shifted correctly again. Stays in gear too long, hard shifts etc. Working with the dealer to attempt a fix. All in all, a great vehicle for the price, all essential features and then some. Look hard at the this vehicle; you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 1st Subaru and the 1st SUV. I have about 700 miles on it and love it so far. I've been averaging 18.6 mpg in the city. Once in a while I can hear the rear seat belts making noise, especially if you have something leaning against them. Overall very comfortable ride, fairly smooth. Radio controls on the steering wheel are nice, but I manage to hit them accidentally when turning somehow. Gas cap rests on the exterior paint during refuel, don't really like that, but it's minor. I'm 5.9" and steering wheel adjustment is fine, no problems, plenty of leg room. My insurance went down a little due to Subaru being a safer vehicle. It handles like a smaller car, and has plenty of cargo room.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had Tribeca 3 weeks and put 1500 miles on. A few defects found, but probably from Dealer roughness. Car rides nice, fairly quite and smooth. Have had WAY TOO many vehicles,and just traded in a Hyundai Santa Fe Limited. There are trade-offs, but I would put the Santa Fe first for now. Still happy with the choice, but time will tell. Getting 19 MPG so far. Rate a BUY for good value! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Current mileage 2000. Transmission clunks hard into first gear downshifting to a stop; A/C is not cold enough for a cabin of this size - dealer said it was overcharged; suspension clunking sound made from the front wheels when hitting slightest of bumps ? reminds me of bad ball joints in an old car; acceleration at cruising speed not smooth, instead feels out of balance; gas cap rests on exterior paint during refuel, need telescoping steering wheel; back seats wobble and make noise as does the rear seat belt from the ceiling; exhaust makes tinny vibration sound when accelerating hard. Expected more from this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our 2nd Subaru and we couldn't be happier. Our first was a 2003 Forester, which is still running strong and soon to become the kids car. You just can't beat Subaru when it comes to safety and dealing with snow, rain, or ice. Oh yeah almost forgot they are also fun to drive. People at work are almost always surprised to hear that our Tribeca is a Subaru. The exterior is as nice and the interior nicer then the couple Acura MDXs I park beside everyday at work. The best part thanks to the price we can still afford to take ours on a road trip when we feel like it. We are just starting to look for my wife a new car and the 2009 Forester is looking like the front runner.</TEXT>

Fun to drive and with AWD handles great on rain slicked roads. Will be going up to the western NC mountains next month and am looking forward to mountain driving. Looked and test drove Mazda CX-9, Buick Enclave, GMC Acadia, Acura MDX, and Toyota Highlander. The Subaru Tribeca seemed to be the best fit and great value for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased a 2008 Subaru Tribeca Limited 7 pass last month. I have always driven Acura vehicles over the last 10 years but was turned off to the high cost of the MDX. I test drove the GMC Acadia, Buick Enclave,Toyota Highlander, and MDX. The Tribeca beat all these with respect to ride, performance, comfort, and safety. I only have 500 miles on it but am very satisfied so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We were coming up on the lease of our Sienna. We looked at several crossovers: Acadia, Edge, Murano, Pilot, CX9, Highlander. My wife had a Subie when we first met, and she asked to look at the new one. We drove all the others, and we drove this and said, "Yes." This a fun car to drive, room for kids and cargo, AWD, and we like the design. We got the gold color with tan leather. Even in the sun all day, it doesn't get that hot inside. Got it on a 42 mo lease, and we are very happy. Getting 17mpg mixed driving, but the engine only has 600 miles. Better mileage to come when fully broken in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased the Tribeca. I previously owned a Mercedes SUV and a Toyota Highlander. I love the interior and features but I don't care for the ride. It is very bumpy and I am sensitive to motion. The Toyota gave a much much better ride and I am sorry I didn't buy it out of the lease. I was swayed by the features I didn't have in the Highlander like heated seats, memory seats, outside temp reading, etc. The insurance is a fortune-my bad for not checking. They say it is because it costs so much to fix and the excise tax is very high which I didn't factor in. Factor in all your costs before making this purchase! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our second Subaru - also own 2003 Forester. It snows where we live and the Subaru AWD is arguably the best on the market. Wanted a larger Subaru, but did not like the styling of the original B9 Tribeca, nor its lack of power and premium fuel requirement. All these objections overcome with the new version. It handles like a smaller vehicle, is very secure feeling, and comfortable (except for adults in the third row, but we knew this when we bought it - it is fine for children. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The first Subaru we've owned and we love it! We were looking at the Honda Pilot(booring look), Toyota Higlander Hybrid(cheapo interior, drives like truck), GMC Acadia(drives like a bigger gas guzzling truck),Acura MDX (liked this but not as much as the Subaru for lots of little reasons not to mention value). The Tribeca immediately stood out. The build quality is excellent. The vehicle exudes confidence between the engine, all-wheel-drive, skid control, and all of the other safety features. The flat engine is extremely smooth even during hard acceleration(almost flooring it). The 3rd row is a little cramped but we only have 2 kids and aren't going cross-country in it either.

<TEXT>Have had the Tribeca for 5 months and 6,000 miles. Combination driving I am averaging 19.5 miles. In city - 17 to 18 which is as advertised. Highway only trips 22 - 24. We have had a Land Rover Discovery, Acura MDX, Mercedes ML 320 and Volvo XC70 - this vehicle is every bit as good and much less expensive. Because of those other SUVs I was smart enough to not get the built in Navi. Spent $250 on a Garmin. Almost bought BMW X5 but decided to save $20K - glad I did.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2003 Audi A4 Avant because it was so unreliable. The Tribeca is a hidden gem, it has a great ride and all the features of a Lexus RX but costs $12,000 less. While the critics complain about lack of space in rear rows that only applies to the 7 seater, the 5 seater has plenty of leg room. I think Subaru should stop trying to market the Tribeca as a 7 seater. Mileage could be better, but it helps that the Tribeca runs on regular gas. Handling is good enough that I don't miss the Audi. The overall ride is quiet, smooth and feels very sophisticated. The stereo is very good and helps make the commute highly enjoyable. The nav system has worked fine for me thus far. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The rear view camera, puddle lights, large side mirrors. Subaru's reliability. Stylish interior. Most of all I like the fact that I've been driving this car for a month and have not come across another 08 Tribeca on the streets.

<TEXT>Traded in my problematic Audi Allroad finally. We're very impressed with our 08 LL Bean Outback 3.0L that we bought in April. So I tested the Tribeca. I didn't like the interior design too much - spacey. I looked at all the other CUV/SUVs and other wagons that were so much more. Thought about used MDX. Liked the new Subi better. Agree with all comments on stupid nav system. They can fix that by issuing a new software update if they're smart. I'm getting 19mpg on 87octane buzzing around town and commuting 42 miles each way a day. The car has 1750 miles and will improve. Overall very comfortable and pleased.

<TEXT>I backed into the Subaru Tribeca because the Acura Dealers were not willing to negotiate on the RDX. That caused me to research more and I found the Tribeca with a six cylinder engine instead of a turbocharged 4 cylinder and I never looked back. I've now had the car 3 months and I am very happy the Acura dealers were shortsighted. The Tribeca is the most fun to drive of any car I have ever owned and I've owned quite a few. It corners and holds the road like a sports car. The "toys" radio, gps, sound sys are excellent. The backup camera is great, especially at night. Mileage is average, in the 18 to 20 range. The one shortcoming is the gas tank. It should have greater capacity.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've driven nearly 3,000 miles on my new Tribeca. I previously drove a Cadillac STS, and wanted a comfortable, sporty ride, that didn't require me to sit so low to the ground. My Tribeca is very comfortable, sporty (for this kind of vehicle), and versatile with the room in back and fold down seats. The nav system is inconsistent - sometimes it's great, others, like a trip to central OH last week, it wants to send you 100 miles out of your way. Gas mileage could be better. The 2008 model is good looking, with a smooth engine and terrific all wheel drive at a nice price. It also has lots of storage, cup holders and power ports for family use.

<TEXT>I've had my 5-passenger Ltd. Tribeca less than 2 weeks, but with the exception of the gas mileage (avg 14.9 city MPG), I'm really loving it! There is plenty of head and leg room (I'm 5'8 and BF is 6'1). Has a comfortable yet peppy driving response, good pickup in the city. This is my first Subaru purchase after years of VW driving, but I don't think it will be my last. Side note: GPS navigation system, in hindsight, would have been better purchased after market. I'd have more room on the console without having to "agree" to it's use each time I start the vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ambient lighting on dash. Comfortable, quiet ride. Nicely appointed leather seating and interior trim. Puddle lights. Exterior/interior styling options. Subaru reliability and safety.

<TEXT>This is my 4th Subaru. They are a very reliable car, and great in winter weather. The fit and finish of the car is superb. The interior is quite roomy both front and rear, and I like the styling. I looked at BMW and Lexus, and I bought the Subaru. To my taste, the exterior looks just like every other crossover. It's nice, but not distinctive. The interior has high style and comfort. It handles very well, and has just the right amount of power. Braking is spectacular. I am not comfortable with the way the transmission shifts, particularly on hills. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Live in Cleveland Ohio where winters are harsh and streets are not well maintained. Test drove the Tribeca and my wife and I loved the performance, comfort, and style of the Tribeca. Traded in two full size SUVs for two Tribeca LTDs the same day. Absolutely love this SUV. Solid feel, great handling, fun to drive, very comfortable, loaded with features and thoughtful amenities. Feels comparable (and even preferable) to Lexus/BMW/Mercedes/Acura SUV at 10k less. All of the other SUVs I'd considered were on the dealers trade-in lot from people who bought Tribecas. My wife is getting 18/24 mpg on her used 2006 Tribeca B9, however I'm still in break-in period and getting 12-18 mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Full time all wheel drive is great as is traction control. Vehicle come completely loaded so you don't have to haggle about options. Interior is beautiful. Engine warms quickly, Love having the option between XM and Sirius. Love the puddle lights. Full warranty is a plus. Uses regular 87 octane gas.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first import, wanted something that was not mainstream and found it! A real looker, have many positive compliments on it and especially since Subaru is has a history of not being attractive/sexy cars. Rides like a heavy SUV but with a soft suspension. Pulls my 18' I/O runabout boat with surprising ease. Corners very well and has solid brakes. So far able to pull out 260ish miles on a tank of 87 octane. And that is with the help of my "lead" foot. Base stereo should offer at least 6 disk in dash for this class of car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very quiet inside the cockpit. Love the award winning interior. Big difference when driving in Sport mode. Practical cup holders. Large mirrors are practical and do not take away from the sexy exterior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased this vehicle this weekend, and absolutely love it. The ride and handling is great and the AWD system inspires confidence. Nav system is easy to use, but is a little far away. The redesign provides more rear seat room, and with the 7 passenger, you get rear AC controls that help a great deal. Handling is very precise and acceleration with the nex 3.6 liter engine is much better than in the previous generation.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear backup camera is very cool and works great to give you a clear view behind you even at night. Guidance markers that show the path of the car are great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After talking to persons who own a Subaru I knew they were onto something. I 'test drove' a few friends who own them and could feel the solidness of the vehicle. Since I don't buy new cars every few years (previously drove a '97 Blazer) I wanted to make sure this was the car for me. It is. Reading the reports on Subaru's reliability also moved me into purchasing it. Size wise, it's perfect. Not too big or small. Driving the Tribeca one can feel the responsiveness of it. A good, linear feel, like you are on rails, plus great stopping power. Good road feel too. Not too soft or harsh. Like Goldilocks' porridge, just right! Plus quick acceleration when stomped on.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ambient lighting. I thought it'd be hokey. It isn't. Rear view mirrors take in a wide area of viewing. Nice for passing. The exterior design doesn't draw much attention. Somewhat bland. But that's ok with me. Who needs attention? </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After researching the typical makes of SUVs I decided on the Tribeca. It is fun to drive, handles well & looks sporty. The interior controls are easy to use especially at night due to the red backlighting. The stability control is awesome. I feel it is the only thing that kept me on the road when I was hydroplaning in a bad rain storm. You can actually feel the system work as it steers you in the right direction. The ride is very smooth and quiet.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated mirrors, seats & wipers, standard AWD, trip info (MPG, time, etc), iPod connector, CD changer.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking at the 2008 Tribeca for some time. We finally bought the vehicle two weeks ago. A great car to drive. The ride is very smooth and very quiet. The car handles well. Enough cargo space (more than in a Murano). Easy controls, great sound system. Very comfortable overall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very happy. Quality is solid - interior and exterior design is perfect for family of four. We fit two car seats and small adult in second row without a problem. Third row is really for children or small adults - somewhat difficult to access. Acceleration is excellent in upper gears. Some engine whine in lowest gear. Seamless shifting otherwise. Handles more like a car than SUV. Ride quality is excellent, smooth. Compared to the Jeep Grand Cherokee with AWD (Rocky Mountain Ed.), the handling is more reliable on wet surfaces. It will be hard to beat the Jeep in deeper snow though - we'll see. Larger adults will feel somewhat awkward driving due to short steering column and seat position.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride quality. Interior amenities. Styling. Plenty of room for kids and multiple adults (short trips). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After looking at and driving all the other SUVs in its class and some above it, this by far was the best vehicle. If you are in the market for this type of vehicle you owe to yourself to take a test drive, you will be sold. The mileage surprised me. I am getting 18.5 to 19 mpg in suburban driving. It is quiet, smooth and has one of the smoothest shifting transmissions I have driven, almost as smooth as a CVT. The power curve is excellent. Subaru has hit a home run with this vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Front seat comfort, I am 6'4" and my wife is 5', it is really comfortable for either to drive. The sound system is as good as any premium unit I have had in other vehicles.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased our first ever Subaru. Have always owned Honda. The changes for 08 make an already very good vehicle better! Great performance with standard AWD. The interior is heads above the rest. Would have liked a sliding armrest on the console. My wife drives close to the steering wheel and the armrest is to far back for her. Subaru will sell more Tribecas if they can get customers into showrooms to test drive them. Put this one on your shopping list!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>The vehicle has good power and does not have to shift down to pull hills. I averaged approximately 23 miles per gallon on the trip from Virginia to Tennessee at speeds from 55 to 75. The seats are supportive. The navigation system needs street number and address info before it will initiate. Good information display. Some people might like more adjustment in the steering wheel position. So far it has been very good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After much debate on Tribeca?s 3rd row comfort, I bought the 2008 Tribeca. It is smooth, wonderfully stable and deserves to be compared with lux utes. It costs $7-8k less than the Acura and 10k less than Volvo and BMW but more reliable than either. Very nice touches with ambient lighting, puddle lights (optional), etc. It has very smooth engine and its dynamic stability control really works (unlike the one I had in my minivan), most effective AWD system of many out these and absorbs bumps very well. Very little road noise too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have wanted a larger Subaru for years, first Tribeca was too ugly and underpowered for me. The new Tribeca is very quiet and smooth with plenty of power from the new engine. Getting 19-20 mpg in mixed driving, as high as 24 mpg on 2-lane highway at 60 mph. New tranny is very smooth, as is power delivery. New exterior was what I had been wanting, kind of bland grille but better than the fish-mouth of last year. Good handling for a crossover, ride is sweet, overall very impressed. Boxer engine/AWD combo hard to beat. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Boxer engine, low cg, unique and stylish interior, Subaru durability, quality and reliability. Better than expected mpg. Lots of leg room for tall people. Smooth and quiet engine and tranny. Has ten airbags, five star crash ratings, with VDC stability control, should be very safe. 87 octane!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>'08 Tribeca is head and shoulders above the underpowered '07 model with ugly front looks. The drive is smooth, the design and build quality are great. It's a hungry beast, though - I can't get more than 17 mpg out of it. Other than that, beautiful car, and I am very happy with it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just drove the new 08 Tribeca. While cleaning my house and finding the Subaru magazine, I looked through it and found out about all the new changes of the 08 Tribeca. I own a 06 tribeca and have always been disapointed with the engine and transmission. So, went to town and drove the 08 and found the difference to be very very noticable within the first few seconds of driving it. I went back the next day and purchased the new 2008 Tribeca. I love all the great changes. Thanks Subaru!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The new engine and transmission. Plus the iPod plug in. Oh yes and running on normal unleaded gasoline, not the premium like the 06.</FAVORITE>
