<TEXT>Just bought the car. Put about 1500 miles on her. Runs great. Don't really care about the interior. Bought it just for outside look and performance. Drifted around 80 degree turn at 80mph. Handles great! This is a sports car.....Not made for comfort. Don't buy if you want comfort. I bought it for drifting.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD control. Great for drifting. Bucket seat ready for five point harness. Great body trim and suspension.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well, this isn't your normal Lancer. Owned this car for 1 year and had no problem but the clutch... I don't even drive hard or launch the car, but around 12k I had to change out the clutch. I ended up getting aftermarket clutch and new flywheel because of the warp. Beside that I enjoy the car and the fun that comes with it. I joined a local car club and ended up mod a bit out of the car... Gas stinks, but it is a 2.0 pushing out near 300hp on a 3k pound car... Love it... Interior is so so if you got the base model, but an EVO is made for driving not luxury.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had this car for 1 year now and still love the drive feel of the car. One of the best performance cars I ever driven. Exterior looks stunning. Handling is fantastic. Not so good on the gas mileage, especially with small tank (means need to fill up more often), but looking performance wise not too bad. Need better quality interior for the price of the car. As for reliability, need to do something for the stone chips problems.</TEXT>

<TEXT>No test drive, I knew what I was getting into. First time driving it out of the dealer lot...WOW! This monster has torque, seats are supportive but very difficult to adjust when reclining. The interior plastic parts are below average compared to my 06 Civic. The plastics are flimsy and cheap to the touch. The transmission is notchy [esp. upshifting to 2nd gear and when compared to HONDA tranny]. I've had 2003 WRX so this GSR's tranny isn't that much of a complaint to me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Evo and had it shipped across the country without ever test driving it. I was a bit skeptical but read several reviews and bit the bullet. Driving this car is exhilarating. Every time I am behind the will I'm grinning ear to ear. It's by far the fastest car I've ever driven and for the money it's a steal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power/speed is by far the best part. The handling is a close second. The intoxicating whistle of the turbo begs you to push the pedal down a little bit more. The navi with music server is also very nice. The SSS Fosgate stereo is incredible. Phantom Black!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Excellent perf out of the box! Handling is as nimble as S2000, slight understeer. Very little turbo lag as the RPMs climb effortlessly. The TC-SST is superb! Auto is great in LA traffic, and Manual Sport just screams for open pavement. Driven stick my entire life (I'm 29), I welcome TC-SST technology as an early adapter. Shifts fast! Don't have to give up the power as I would driving a torque converter auto! AWD noise is clunky sometimes, and turn radius is a bit larger than I'd like. Gauges need more driver info, but seats are AWESOME. Steering wheel is perfect size. 1 gripe: car has no "legs!" Small fuel tank means frequent fill. Overall very happy! Can't beat 0% APR & wife can drive it too! :)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Wife can drive it! (<3 you TC-SST!) Can fit baby seat in back and stroller when the time comes! S-Sport is very responsive. Faster than I could shift manually! Recaro seats are fantastic. Exterior: very aggressive! Have to drive it to realize how fun it really is! (psst.. 2 words: Launch Mode!)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have now owned our 2008 EVO for four months now. At first, I will say that we were very excited about our purchase. That was until we waxed the vehicle for the fourth time 1 1/2 weeks ago. My husband noticed a massive amount of paint chips above the rear tires on both sides of the car and also on the hood. I searched the web, and found we are not alone! Tons of people have this affliction, and Mitsubishi has done nothing for most of them. Do not buy this vehicle unless you want your paint to chip off, or your windshield to chip with 3000 miles on the car. Very poorly made and will not last. Worst purchase we have ever made as far as quality. Huge regrets.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a wonderful driving car. The car handles excellently, and if it is tuned, can put out an exceptional 400hp. Drifting with this vehicle is harder being it is All Wheel Drive but otherwise is a very fun car. The new 2008 mustang gt puts out 300hp and is 1 1/2 times more heavy. Stock this car will smoke all the other cars for the same price. Great on gas, great reliability. The Subaru WRX STI is a great car as well although the latest models of this car are hatchback which is not preferred and do not do as well with handling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>These cars are good, but not worth the premium over the GSR's. These cars are overpriced in my opinion. They are great fun, handle well, good power, and the AWD system is tops. The interior is just so so, the comfort is bad but it is not a cruiser, and the power is good but not great. I am sure in the next year we'll see all the tuner parts come out hen the fun will begin! If you have time, wait for the prices to come down. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So I finally talked my husband out of his Mustang Saleen to go to an import. Let me say after driving the EVO, it didn't take much! The car handles amazingly well. We were torn between the Subaru WRX STI and the Evo. After driving the Subaru, we felt a bit "lost" with the six speed. I would agree that this car having a sixth gear would not be a bad idea. I also say that these "all over the board" quarter mile times that they are reporting are completely inaccurate for the car. Haven't has the chance to romp on it yet as it only has 200 miles. For our first Mitsubishi, we are definitely NOT disappointed!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased an 08 GSR two weeks ago and can't stop driving it. The car is amazing. Although it could use a 6th gear the car just wants to be driven. I am 6'2" and find the car to be a little tight and probably wouldn't be a wise choice to take on a long trip. The spooling of the turbo and shifting is precise. It's flat out the best car for the money. I'm 32 and owned a lot of fast cars but I would rate this car at the top. Trust when I tell you it won't disappoint the buyer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the pleasure of driving my new EVO X for the last 2 wks and it sure has been a blast. I Love the looks, handling, power and head turning it causes. Some just see a lancer, but those who really know, see it for what it truly is: one heck of a driving experience. I have owned BMW to RX8's and sedans/SUVs in between. It was a toss between the RX8 R3, 350Z, G37, MB or BMW. For the cost and driving fun I think it is a great value PLUS it seats 5 and I can take the kids and wife every blue moon to keep her content. I have not driven it hard (YET) due to its low mileage (got it with 50!) but can't wait to hit 1K miles. Interior is decent, not sure of the cloth arm rest. 21 again</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my MR for a month now, and it has been an amazing experience. The car has tons of power and is very responsive. The handling is outstanding; I am amazed at what this car can do on winding roads. The transmission in this car must be driven to be believed. In Sport mode, the shifting is crisp and firm. The downshifts are perfectly timed, and are done better then I can run a clutch after 20+ years of driving. The logic that controls the transmission is very well set up; I haven't even touched the paddle shifters. The car is always in the gear that I need.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks; this car turns a lot of heads, and I always have people asking me about the car. Transmission is excellent; I will never buy a manual again when this typr of transmission is available. Technology package was worth every penny, as well as the body kit. Phantom black is a great color.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great sports car, but be ready to make some compromises.This thing is a blast to drive. Most fun car I have owned. Just like the last review, I had to replace windshield at 800 miles. BUY the clear 3m paint guard, especially front, and rear rocker in front of rear wheel. Great stock stereo, but no steering wheel control, seats are great, if you fit their ideal size, because they hardly adjust, plus the material is cheap, and wears quick. This isn't my only car, so it fits me perfectly. Personally I could use it as a daily driver. Just be prepared to pay extra for its performance in little items, like tires, windshields, upgrades, you will want to tune. Highly recommended.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks,steering, the feeling of it always wanting to go, I've had other performance cars that were sedate, this one always wants to go harder, faster. 4 doors if you need them. Good resale. Future tunability. Fast key, headlights, awd, recaros, if they fit. wheels, brembo, </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Evo Owner</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I've had my EVO for about 6 months, and there are two really annoying things about it: First the paint is super thin and scratches easily, after the first two repairs I've put clear bra on most of the car, so plan on spending $1000 or more on that, and do it before it scratches. (front, rocker panels, and trunk deck) Second the windshield is wafer thin. Mitsu did this to save weight. I got a minor chip in mine and the windshield split when trying to repair it. I'm replacing it with a standard lancer windshield which is thicker, but heavier. Anyway plan on spending another $350 on that.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had 3 Evo's, and this one is the most daily driver friendly yet. The 5 speed is notchy when cold, but otherwise the car performs well. The handling is truly the best thing about the car. The steering is telepathic, and the brakes are excellent. Power is fair, but the second factory reflash helped smooth things out and helped the upper rpm range. I fixed a rattle in the glovebox, other than that the interior is quiet. Tire noise is high, but the upgraded satellite radio/audio system is superb. Aftermarket parts and tuning solve the power issues quickly and easily.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, brakes, audio system, cruise control (A first on an Evo). Recaro seats are nice, and the car truly has great looks especially from the front. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was worried about buyer remorse before I bought this car, but now that I have it, I'm glad I took the risk. I was planning to get a reasonable car, like an Acura or something, but figured you only live once, so I got the Evo. I have a perma-smile since I drove it off the lot. The few things I don't like, the driver seat is not very adjustable, the shifts into 2nd and 3rd are kind of clunky until the clutch warms up, the trunk is tiny (not big enough for golf clubs w/ sub, and no fold down seats for snowboard) and the road noise is loud on rough surfaces. The good, its sharp when you want it to be, and tame on your daily commute. All in all, not a bad daily driver, and fast.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handles like a go-kart, accelerates like a big block. Rockford Fosgate stereo is awesome - plenty of features, but not too many. Room for 5 normal adults. The HID headlights work really well. Looks amazing - everyone likes it, from the tuners in parking lots, to the girls down the street.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First of all, I am 30. I have owned Trans-Am's and Camaros my entire life. I was in need of a 4 door car and fell in love with the looks of the Evo. I am amazed at the power the little 2.0 liter engine makes with the Turbo. It is such a different driving experience than the torque monsters I am use to, but I love it! It takes turns and curves like it is on a rail. I miss fish tails and power slides, but being able to take turns at speeds my Camaro SS could never achieve makes up for it. I would recommend the Sight Sound and Spoiler package for potential buyers. The bad, seats are a little uncomfortable & need more adjustment options. Had to have factory CPU flash to help acceleration.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling and acceleration are awesome. 4 door 5 passengers. Stereo System is unbelievable and has built in iPod jack. Factory exhaust has a nice tone. HID head lights. Evo gets a lot of thumbs up, and compliments from other drivers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It's been about 2 months and I've put about 2500 miles of highway and city driving. No tracking done. The vehicle has performed wonderfully. I just transitioned from a 2001 Camry, so my expectations were easily exceeded with this car. I was able to get a test drive at a dealership in Pittsburgh and loved it. The Subaru guys did not let me have one, so I just bought the one I knew I'd like. I also took the 10 year 100,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty with a 100$ deductible since I do not intend to mod the car much. Its just lovely as it is. I knew before purchasing the car that it was going to be an expensive affair, but I was ready to pay the premium for the enjoyment since I could afford it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My fav features are Acceleration, aggressive steering ratio and the killer looks.I have been told by 4 people till date that the car looks amazing.Gave me a REALLY good feeling about my decision to purchase.I got a fully loaded minus the NAV.Sound system ROCKS! height adjustable Headlamps r cool.</FAVORITE>

Driving it is the best justice for you to realize the reason why this is the "HALO" vehicle for Mitsubishi. Think about it, Subaru and BMW use the turbo built by Mitsubishi. Enough said.

<TEXT>Well I got a bad one, and started out on the wrong foot, I still dearly love my car, but at 1143 miles I required a new transmission. My notchy went grinding and then ripping, I got a new tranny, im not grinding as bad now, but still grinding. I love the overall car tho, just wish I had gotten a different one. I realize people have a lot of notchy issues, hopefully this is something that will play out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My new Evo X GSR has blown me away, but before I get to why, I'll note what's wrong: needs 6th gear in manual, better clutch. At this pricepoint, I expect a few more interior luxuries. Sight, sound and spoiler should be stock. Also, why are the brakes not cross drilled, and why must they leave so much brake dust on my wheels? Highs: great stereo with sight, sound and spoiler. Comfort of drive is extremely high for a car that pulls a lateral G. Insanely fun to drive. Seriously stylish. Outruns anything in its class or the next one up. With Vishnu, HKS, K&N, and NOS, this car will be able to hit 600+ bhp. I believe I can get the 1/4 down to 10s.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Lows Seats and steering wheel should be more adjustable. More choices should be available for interior prestige. Car is hard to find, selection does not exist. Needs a sixth gear on the manual and a tighter gear pattern. Tough to launch without burning clutch. Highs Quick, Responsive, Amazing Handling, Comfortable (Racing seats are a nice touch, Great Stock Stereo (except lack of PIO adapter), attention grabber (except when its the cops attention) I have the GSR with Sight Sound and Spoiler package. The car is amazingly fast and smooth. Its extremely fun to drive (which is the most important factor here), comfortable, and immersive. Highs are really high, lows are mostly minor.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, Acceleration, Responsiveness, Immersiveness, FUN FACTOR A perfect 10 to drive, show, tune. Even fun to clean. Okay, maybe not, but it is a fun car.

<TEXT>I'm loving this car so far. It's a bit heavier than my IX was, but it makes up for it with a vastly superior chassis and substantially better handling potential. The fit and finish have been improved, the brakes are bigger (since the car is as well), the final drive is a bit shorter, and it now has Mivec on both cam gears with a chain driven system on the new 4B11. No more timing belt! Fueling is just pig rich stock. This car will wake up substantially when an aftermarket ECU solution becomes available to the general public.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Lack of overdrive gear really kills highway mileage (3500-4000rpms); really bogs down below 3k rpms, still has turbo lag between 3-5k then starts to fall flat above 5500 rpm. Redline might as well be 5500 rpm. Handles great but the only way to safely test its limits is at the track. Don't bother buying unless you plan to track the car at least recreationally.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Gosh, I just got the car two days ago. So far, it is more solid than I expected, not an econobox at all. I have the 5 speed. You are doing around 3,000 rpm at 65mph. It needs a sixth gear. At 100 miles the Service Engine Soon light came on. 1) I checked the gas cap and 2) I am sure it is nothing, but it is still a PITA to go to the dealer and drop it off. On the positive side, the car is fun with 5 seats. Give me a few weeks and I will give a good full review. Gotta break it in first.</TEXT>
