<TEXT>I was a died-in-the-wool Honda guy, driving my second Accord (an '89) into the ground, so I really pictured myself in a Fit. But the black- interior only, no-sunroof, constraints knocked them out. I got busted for DUI the third night I had it, and it cast a real pall over that wonderful "new car" feeling. (I'm not a bad guy... it's a long story). Anyway - LOVE it now. They finally fixed a minor rumble/rattle from the back that I lived with the first year, and it looks like new and suits me to a T. I bought it specifically for hauling things with the seats down, and it's great - the cargo nets help a lot.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6-disc CD Changer (I work for an audiobook catalog company and get to borrow them for free(!)). Regrettably, the only thing I DON'T like is that it lacks the iPod/mp3 jack that the 2009 has in the armrest.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I needed the most fuel efficient car I could find that could still carry a bunch of stuff. There were some good hybrid options, but they were too pricey and I'm unsure about the battery technology. So, I checked out the Matrix, Fit, and Mazda 3. They are all good cars that would have worked, but I went with the Matrix because I got a pretty good price, got a long warranty, and it had all the features I needed. Had a little more space than the Fit and was more comfortable in the driving position. I was also hoping to have something very reliable, and Toyota along with the Corolla this is based on, seemed perfect. 23,000 miles in it still seems like the right choice. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Can fit a lot of stuff in it. Seats fold down flat. Comfortable for a small car. 27mpg 65/35 city/hwy. Less if more city, can push 30 if more hwy. Did a 1,200 mile trip and kept the cruise at 66 as much a possible and got over 35mpg! Been reliable so far.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Toyota, never really liked them until I got mine and Toyota has me sold for life. Great car all around, comfort is ok, like others, back seat can be a little more confy and I have to issues with the driver side. Great acceleration for a small 1.8l vvt-I four banger. I put in a cold air intake and got better mpg and performance. I also love the looks better than the 09, don't like the new design. Have not had any issues with it at all. I got mine in the speedway blue metallic color and everyone compliments me for it, great color. Car handles very well on curves and ride quality isn't bad for a small compact. I only wish I had gotten the awd when they offered it, I hate my self 4 that.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, gas mileage, performance, quality, ok comfort, not bad. REALLY FUN TO DRIVE and SHOW OFF. Anyone that talks smack about it, dosen't understand cars, it's a great car for the price and what it is. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I truly love my Matrix. A friend of mine bought a 2007 XR and she loves it. I am 6ft7in tall and weigh 276lbs. I have great head and leg room. Also the body style seems to sit higher than a standard car and this makes it easier to get in and out of. We have made 2 trips to Gulf Shores AL and found it to be a pleasure to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Moonroof, adjustable seats and steering wheel</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was a previous Honda Civic owner when I purchased my Matrix for increased versatility. I found the car to be comfortable, roomy (for me at 5ft10in and my husband at 6ft3in), a blast to drive, and great for hauling anything I wanted to put in it. I also learned recently that the Matrix is also a very safe car. I was in a front-end collision with a Suburban the other day. I estimate the impact was at ~50mph. The car is a total loss, but I walked away with nothing but a scratch and few bruises (mostly from the seat belt). I would buy another '08 Matrix in a second if I could. It's a bummer the '09s are less fuel efficient. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The turning radius is mind-blowingly small, large cargo and passenger space, versatile and peppy little car that was so fun to drive. I'm so sad my Matrix is gone.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my Matrix for just over a year now. It's a great little drive. Combined mileage is 28 mpg for my automatic. I get plenty of power for highway acceleration. I coach soccer and the hatchback lets me haul all my gear, including 5 foot corner flags. The fact that you can fold down just part of the back seat is very convenient. My only issue is the driver's seat back support. I'm used to a minivan with big soft comfortable seats. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cargo area with the 60/40 split back for easy fold down options. Good gas mileage. Low tire pressure warning light is handy. Fun to drive (says my teenage daughter).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have put 15k on my matrix already in 5 months. We have been up and down the east coast, including snow in the Adirondacks this November. I have camped out of it on several occasions. This vehicle is a very reliable and versatile machine. I recommend it to anyone. Competes with any Subaru, if it isn't better. I have carried canoes, bikes, kayaks and skis. It handles well even fully loaded.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ability to get it off road because it has a small wheel base. I have driven around mudholes and rocks where others needed 4x4. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been wanting a Matrix for the last two or three years, and I finally got one at the end of 2007! It is the best car I have ever owned, and it is so much fun to drive! I don't regret for minute buying it, and not only is is sporty and cute, it's very comfortable! I'm 5'4, but I have people who are over 6'0 tall riding in my care on a regular basis, and they all agree it is comfortable as well! This is my first Toyota, and I believe they have me for life now! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>How comfortable the seats are, the six speaker stereo system, and the sun roof! I also love how much room there is in it, and that when the seats are folded down, it's all plastic on the back, so it protects your upholstery.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my wife's car. She bought it for the gas mileage which is good. As far as driving and comfort it does not have it. For a teenager this would be a great first car but I'm 6'2 and long legged. Trying to back up is hard cause you can't see out the back. If you don't know how to use mirrors to back up your in trouble.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>None except for the gas mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted a matrix for so long! I was so excited to finally get one! Unfortunately that excitement is turning into misery. First off, I'm not terribly picky. I've never considered a little road noise to be an issue or felt the need to drive a car with the high end comfort. Comfort was something I completely took for granted, until now, The steering position is so awkward! I have the seat all the way forward, but still I must reach for the wheel. This puts a lot of strain on my shoulders. And something is not right about the head rests, they push my head FOREWARD! The passenger seat and back seats aren't bad, just the drivers seat. As for road/wind noise, It's really bad.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the way the car looks. It can carry whatever I want to put it it, though things slide all over that big back seat. Back seat is roomy. Don't expect to be able to reach it from the front. Acceleration is very good and gas mileage is decent. I'm getting about 28 mpg, mostly highway commuting.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great fuel economy, good leg room, lots of storage slots, and great stereo speakers. It has awesome fuel economy for a mid size car, roomy, and handles well. Also it is fun to drive and handles curves and turns well. I gave a 9 for comfort because the ride is a little rough, but not horrible. Still pretty good. I gave an 8 for interior and exterior design because Toyota didn't do much to re-design the 06 and 07 models of the Matrix. Overall I am happy with this car! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good fuel economy, roomy, perky acceleration, large cabin, good headroom, awesome steering, rides high, plus both rear seats fold flat for storage</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We decided to replace our 2002 Subaru Legacy wagon (EPA: 18/25) with a more fuel-efficient car. We went with the Matrix because it was the most fuel-efficient, economical, and reliable car we could find that would fit a large dog in the back. Great dog car! The dog barrier screws into the back of the rear seat - much more secure than any other dog barrier I've encountered. The plastic lining the cargo area is SO much easier to clean than the carpet in other cars. It even came with a bunch of useful nets and screws to organize the cargo area. Perfect car for us and our dogs. And I love how all the seats on the passenger side fold down and the rear window opens to accommodate long items.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy, practical cargo area, fantastic dog divider, flexibility of fold-down seats and rear window, fun to drive, anticipated great Toyota reliability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently totalled my '02 Pathfinder and settled on the Matrix. I like the seats but the door's arm-rest does not accommodate my long arms. The vehicle was a good choice for me after considering a lot of other vehicles, it was the best overall purchase for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With gas prices soaring, had to trade in my 07 4dr tacoma. Didn't make sense for 50 mile daily commute anymore. Even in Atlanta traffic, I still manage 30-32 mpg with an xr automatic. Granted I'm not driving aggressively or rarely top 60 mph. First vacation trip this week with 3 people, luggage, running air & 65-70 mph - got 34.5 mpg. I've never got under 30 in 3 months of owning so far, beating the window sticker. Still able to pack enough with wagon like features. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mileage, styling. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 4th Toyota and I have been blessed with economical bliss with this vehicle just like the others. This is a car that works hard all day and then cleans up easily to play in the evening. Sharp looking. Back seats folds flat to make a level cargo area. Will carry 5 people comfortably and gear in the back cargo area. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 5 speed transmission makes it very peppy and it merges very well. I feel safe in this car. It gets wonderful gas mileage, at least 34 mpg. I really like that with the price of gas at $4 a gallon. I can put 20 bags of mulch in the cargo space and it drives smoothly. Tight turning radius.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle to replace the lemon I purchased in Feb of 2007. I was happy when I first purchased the vehicle, but then I realized that it tended to ride like I was in an old pick-up truck. It has been in the shop 3 times so far with brake issues and just seems to be getting worse. At this point I will not get another Toyota ever again because they are just not built like they were and the paint would start to fade.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The radio, and the space in the back for loading things and be able to close the door.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With gas prices ever rising, my van was just too expensive to run. The Matrix was the perfect vehicle to downsize to; it still holds my gear, but gets 40% better mileage than my old MPV and it's fun to drive to boot! I wish Toyota would come out with a Hybrid Matrix, but until then, this one is great!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>In-dash shifter, fuel-sipping 1.8 liter engine, roomy back seats, versatile interior, 6-disk changer.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We are a Toyota family, but are considering switching after this model. The passenger side door continually "squeaks." We are told to "lubricate" the door, but have never had to "lubricate" doors on Camrys, Corollas, or Echos that we have owned. Very disappointing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage. No complaints.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a Focus wagon that did everything I wanted. I upgraded to an MPV, but took such a hit in the mileage and repair bills that I needed to downsize to something more reliable. I fell in love with the Fit Sport, but couldn't quite squeeze my gear (instruments) in comfortably. When I put them in the Matrix, they fit with room to spare. It's fun, sporty, spacious and thrifty. Great purchase! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I did about 25 hours of research, narrowing down to the Honda Fit or the Toyota Matrix. The Fit was nice when I test drove it, but then I tried the Matrix, I loved it. Decided on Matrix becuase there is more room altogether, the trunk,t he car and especially the engine. NO REGRETS whatsoever. I love driving it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Trunk space, higher up on seat (I'm short), fun to drive!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I never thought I'd get a Matrix, but it has rapidly made me decide it is the best and cutest car I ever had. I am only 5'1" but this car cradles me comfortably. I also have back problems but the seats are firm, comfortable, and supportive. I like the lit up dashboard, lots going on there, makes me feel like I'm in a jet LOL. The air vents are nnice too, just flip them in or out. The optional 6-speaker sound system is worth it, as is the moon roof.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I think the seats are excellent, and the 33 mpg I am getting on the highway helps too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I decided on purchasing a Toyota Matrix in Sept., after my new 07 Chevy Malibu was totalled in a car accident in August. It took me a little while to get attached to the Matrix, as I really liked the Malibu. I'm getting almost 30 MPG (all city driving) with the Matrix. It's just a basic car - no bells and whistles, but it's comfortable and, being a Toyota, I'm expecting it to be around for a long time. Though it looks a bit small, I'm actually able to fit my family of five in comfortably.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Driver seat is very comfortable and the Matrix is generally fun to drive. Everything in the engine is easy access and oil changes are only needed every 5,000 miles (not 3,000). Sound system in the basic version is plenty good enough and there's many cubby holes and compartments to store things.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this vehicle 3 months and I cannot believe the various uses I am gfetting from it. I bought to go back and forth to work in and I am happy with the 27MPG city driving I do. The most enjoyable is going to Home depot etc and being able to put back seat down and use all the back room for a vehicle of this class. My only complaint is I am 6'3" and when I get the seat back I drive straight are to reach the steering wheel. Passengers have more than enough room and ride comfortably. Maneuvers very well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only driven my new 2008 manual transmission basic Matrix 200 miles but as of this moment, it's my favorite car I've ever had. It just feels like the "perfect fit". I guess it's really too early for me to say much but so far, so good. I like the way it drives. I like the looks of the inside and outside. I like the amount of visibility it has. The seats are firm but very comfortable on the back. I test drove a Honda Fit Sport and was surprised at how much more I like the Matrix. </TEXT>
