<TEXT>We have now driven our 2008 Acadia more than 30,000 miles. This is by far the best road-trip vehicle we've ever owned, and we have been delighted with its performance and comfort under a wide variety of conditions. Labors a bit with heavy trailers, but handles very well when towing. No repair issues aside from transmission reprogramming to improve shifting responsiveness, which resolved issue. Gas mileage had been pretty good for vehicle of this size, but is VERY sensitive to driving style (highway range from 11mpg towing heavy trailer to 23mpg with moderate load/high speed). Find controls and switches to be laid out very intuitively, seats flip/fold very easily. Would buy again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ridge/handling, style inside and out (always gets a "wow, this is a nice car" comment from passengers), trailer/tow switch for transmission. Long service intervals as guided by on- board sensor.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Car has been in shop with 4 SEPARATE leaks-sunroofs, windows etc, in first 6 months. Gas mileage considerably less than advertised. Stabilitrak kicks in, on corners locking up brakes. Car smells like mold. GMC very unhelpful refusing to do anything more than supply me with a rental for the 30 days its been in the shop. Going through arbitration process for replacement through lemon law. So much for the reliability I had hoped for in a brand new car. Shame on you GMC.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you are interested in an 08 Acadia do yourself a favor and RUN! All the problems with the first year 07's just continued with the 08's. I was back to the dealership every month the first year of ownership with problem after problem. The biggest problems being 10mpg fuel economy as well as multiple water leaks that could not be fixed. please be aware that if you decide to purchase and have problems, the only thing you will get out of GM customer service is a free oil change. Please learn from my mistake!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This is one of the best looking vehicles on the road which is why I bought it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I have had this car for almost a year and we absolutely love it. We had a baby last fall and travel back and forth from Lansing, MI to Western New York (425 miles one way) several times a year and this vehicle has enough room for all three of us our Yellow Lab and all our luggage. It's a dream to drive and with the cruise set at 74 mph I still average 23.2 mpg. When the rear seats are folded down you have more cargo room that you can imagine. I've hauled lots of office furniture with it. I even towed one of my other cars (that broke down) from London Ontario back to Lansing. It towed like a dream too! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always been a Ford Girl and have driven an Expedition for the last 10 years. When gas started going up, I needed something more fuel efficient. Test drove the Acadia, and fell instantly in love. Love the features, the interior is so roomy, and the exterior is beautiful. Wish that it was slightly more powerful, but overall, perfect. I would reccomend the Acadia to any and all who asks about it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This has been the most disappointing brand new vehicle in all my 52 years of ownership. The sunroof has been "fixed" 3 times and still leaks. A natural gas odor comes through the ventilation system. The driveline is noisy and when you make a tight turn is sounds like the wheels are falling off. The engine is sluggish and hesitates. Poor fuel economy and all over poor engineering. The worst part is poor customer service from the selling dealership. They won't do a thing. Just don't buy the Acadia. It might look nice, but it has a long way to go before it can become a low maintenance vehicle. Prepare to have it in the shop often. Just don't buy it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our Acadia in 9/07 because of it's safety ratings, size, comfort and price. Initially we had no problem and loved the car until a year after we owned it. Then the leaks started (9/08) and we're still having problems. First they installed the drain extension tubes for the sunroof but that didn't work. I've had water leaks from my dome lights, grab handle,sun visor and on the floor of the passenger side. I also had the ignition switch replaced last month because the engine kept running with the key out of the ignition!! I am currently beginning the arbitration process! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just drove to FL from NJ towing 2 jet skis. Mileage suffered but not a problem with acceleration and handling. Two guests that drove the car are selling their SUV and Caravan to buy one. Comfort was excellent and the interior space was great. I would highly recommend this car. The total mileage on this trip, towing and not was 5400 miles and not a problem. I would recommend larger mirrors for towing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked at quite a few SUV's, most did not look good, they drove or handled poorly, and majority had really bad gas mileage. Really like this SUV, looks good, handles well, gas mileage not bad at around 22 on road, very smooth ride. All in all, very pleased with the vehicle so far, great family car, especially for long trips. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Fantastic, smooth, comfortable, quiet. We had a 02 Trailblazer prior and it was a great vehicle but this Acadia is so much more refined. Love the dash color at night, fun to drive (but not quite as much as our 01 Corvette). Love the heads up, power rear gate, remote start etc. etc. The imports have nothing on this unit. It is a solid well built machine. You might get a little better mpg with a smaller eco-box but no other SUV this size will get better, I've checked.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything about this vehicle is top shelf, The trani is smooth and precise (remember it's a 6-speed so you won't see a big difference between gears). GM has got this one figured out.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I enjoy driving the Acadia. My only faults with it is a few design issues with the interior. If you want to charge your phone you can't put anything in one of the cup holders in the front. Very little storage space as far as putting things away so they don't move around vehicle while driving, other than back only storage in between two front seats and dash board. I was shocked there was not in floor storage for headsets. I also has a few blind areas when driving hard to see if other cars are in lane on passenger side, perhaps it would help if you could sit up a little higher in the vehicle. Overall it is a nice car even with these few issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is heads and shoulders better than the Yukon it replaced. Much more sophisticated, beautifully engineered, and a pleasure to drive. I specifically ordered bench seats to increase cargo capacity. It's huge. I've been driving GM vehicles for more than 40 years, and this is by far the best. Vehicle has a solid and steady feel to it. Interior is well laid out although small buttons take getting used to. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth and comfortable ride, great handling, all manner of interior creature comforts. Love the satellite radio. Observed mileage around 16 city, 18 mixed, and 21 pure highway. Not bad for a vehicle this size. Power is adequate...barely.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Acadia in January, and I love it. The biggest surprise was the handling. It comes standard with stabilitrac, and you definitely notice how smooth the turns are. It has the room of an SUV but it rides like a Lincoln. If you are afraid to buy an SUV because of gas prices, I'm averaging about 20 mpg city and highway. It only takes $55 to fill up at $3.15 per gallon so it's doesn't hurt too bad. Another great feature is both the 2nd and 3rd row seats fold completely flat giving you massive storage room. ou can also move the 2nd row bucket seats back for more leg room. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The new GMC Acadia is absolutely the best new crossover out there right now. Whichever trim level you decide you will not be disappointed. I have been looking to by a new vehicle for 6 months and at first i thought the price range was just too much. But after comparing the features and standards to other similar vehicles i kept coming back to the acadia. I thought about buying the honda pilot, but after test driving them both i purchased the Acadia. No regrets here.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features on the new GMC Acadia are the dual sunroof, Nav with backup camera, and the power side mirrors. I never thought I needed these things until I got them, now they are my must have features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have owned 3 Yukon XLs, Yukon Denali. Envoy--love this vehicle! More leg room than Envoy, but hate the transmission. Too much surging, lagging, no pick-up, changes gears too often & at wrong time. I'm a GM person, but the transmission needs serious improvement--it's my only complaint about the car, but I don't know if I can stand this for 2-3 yrs.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been looking at this vehicle for about 6 months, but the price compared to other vehicles always kept me looking for something as good but cheaper. Unfortunatly I never found that vehicle. I ended up purchasing this vehicle because it offered everything and more than any other similar vehicle out there. All the little things that it has over the competition ends up making this car a value buy from the low end model to the high end. They really hit the nail on the head with this vehicle. This is such a quite and comfortable vehicle. It is as roomy and a mini-van but still give you the feel of not driving one. Love it </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features on my Acadia has to be the dual sun roof, back up camera, and bucket 2nd row seating. If you use the 3rd row seating at all, being able to just walk between the seats is a huge plus.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my Acadia for only two weeks, but I love everything about this vehicle! I researched many vehicles in this class, but the Acadia surassed all of my expectations! Everything about the Acadia was so well designed. It looks great, the ride is powerful and smooth, and our five children can easily be seated with plenty of room. The V6 engine is very responsive and has plenty of power. I have not expereinced any lag or hesitation. The cruise control function is easily accesible and actually assists in better gas mileage, which for a vehicle of this size, is quite excetional. All conrols are well designed, easliy reached, and the upgraded Bose stereo system is awesome! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The radio controls on the steering wheel are extremely easy to use. The tri-climate control feature is a must for families! The ease of these controls are easily adjusted by our children, who if you ask them, just love the stereo! I love the exterior design of the Acadia. Very stylish! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased our 2008 Acadia last fall after owning a Honda Odyssey for 5 years. This vehicle is wonderful- by far better than the Odyssey! This is the first winter we've had it in Ohio and it handles beautifully through deep snow! The AWD is excellent. It is comfortable and fun to drive. Outstanding turning radius for this size of vehicle- very easy to maneuver. Lots of interior space and rear seats are easy to fold down. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Acadia is very comfortable and smooth drive. The 7 (or 8) passenger seating is a great option. It feels big but I was quickly able to adapt. The mpg is great for a vehicle of this size. It is a little sluggish on take off but it is a big, heavy vehicle but it does get decent mpg. I'm very happy with this vehicle and would definitely recommend it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased a 2008 Acadia on January 31, 2008. We have had nothing but problems with the front end, brakes, and the engine hesitating. The vehicle is comfortable overall except for headrests that stick into your head. The interior is stylish with nice accents and we like the red lights on the interior components. The vehicle handles well. The 6 speed transmission is less than desirable with consistent lag and hesitations. The vehicle can't stay at a constant speed as the engine cuts out and when driving and attempting to accelerate the vehicle hesitates. This is a major safety concern when merging on the highway or trying to accelerate to get out of the way of potential dangers.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is stylish and comfortable with plenty of leg room in any row. The dash is attractive and stylish. 8 passengers is huge plus for traveling with another family. The exterior is sleek and stylish with nice accents. Roof racks are a nice feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Much more room than my previous Envoy. Mileage has been tracking at 19.5 for 50/50 city /highway. Right at 22 plus highway only. The 6 speed tranny works smoothly on flat or downhill roads. Uphill it tends to shift up a bit too soon but it just takes a bit to get uesed to it. It's a minor issue considering the mileage performance. Very quiet ride. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Backup assist is very helpful with the small rear window. 7 pass seating with easy access to rear seats is pretty slick. Console is well put together. Comfortable seats. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am very pleased with the Acadia. I have owned two minivans, four japanese imports, and one German, and the Acadia is the best. I took it on a trip and put 2500 miles on it in one week and rode like a luxury vehicle. The options are comparable with luxury brands without the cost. The mileage is respectable, giving me 14.7 per gallon in mostly city driving. I love the XM and comfort of the seating, as I am 6 feet and over 300 pounds. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I simply cannont tell in words how much fun it is to drive this car. I have been a faithful Chevy Blazer driver since 1995 with the same car! Coming from that car to this car gas wasn't an issue. I love all the cargo space and easy to use features. Remote start is a wonderful feature when it is cold outside and your car is warming for you. It is easier to drive in the wind it doesn't blow me around as much. I couldn't think of a better car to come over too if you are a Blazer, Tahoe or other SUV owner without the need for towing. I highly recommend this car to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very pleased with our Acadia. Upgraded from VolvoXC70. Looks great (summit white) and a real pleasure to drive. Bigger, better layout and way more interesting than CX9, Highlander or Pilot. They really got the suspension right on this vehicle and steering is light and handling is crisp. Good balance of power, not minivan like and not a big V8 SUV nor does it cost as much as one. Integrated entertainment package w/wireless headphones sans NAV system is sweet. Back seat and front seat can finally listen to what they want (XM, MP3, DVD, etc.). Transmission/Power gripes in other reviews are overblown. Six speeds are going to shift more. Works fine for us.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Acadia after test driving vehicles for over a year. I rode in Toyota, Lincoln, Lexus, BMW, Ford, Dodge, Nissan and this was the best ride by far. The price was reasonable as well. I put on some highway miles for my job and feel very safe knowing that I have onstar and AWD for these harsh Canadian winters. I am happy when I drive down the street and see people checking out my SUV. I get so many comments on it and have already had a few Lexus and BMW drivers interested in switching to the Acadia!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The HUD on the dash is amazing. It was an option that I didn't really want but came with the vehicle. I wouldn't change it for one without. I can monitor my speed at all times and love the way that it tells me temp. outside, speed, what song is playing on the radio etc.</FAVORITE>

I feel safe in it with my kids. The interior styling is great, but I also think it has a stylish exterior too! Better than Lexus or Mazada.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Access in and out of the 3rd row seating is the best yet. No more climbing over my seats!! My four year old can work the lever and get out himself! Love that the 3rd row folds down and does not have to be removed like other models just to use the cargo space! AWD great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am a high-miler business traveler and typically trade about every two years at 100,000 miles. Have lots of experience with minivans through SUV's. Thought about another Jeep G. Cherokee, but gas mileage is a problem there. The MDX's were good vehicles although don't pretend they are problem free (transmissions at 50,000+ miles). The Acadia fits my needs very well. In comparison to many vehicles on the road today there is a lot of vehicle here for the money. My late father-in-law was a career engineer for GM, but this is the first new GM vehicle I've purchased in my life (age 54). The Acadia is impressive to drive, beautiful to look at, and clips along at 70 MPH at about 1800-1850 RPM.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>No large SUV/CUV gets 40 MPG! Acadia mileage on Day 1 was better than I ever got from Jeep products and it's much more comfortable. Remote starting is very nice, maintenance schedules are consumer/pocketbook friendly. I opted for the FWD model to lower initial and ongoing maintenance costs</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What more could you want from a vehicle? Better gas mileage (mine averages 21) than SUV's yet with the same amount of space (actually the Acadia has a longer wheelbase than the Yukon). All the extra features you could ask for and comfort, visability, space, etc. The cars message screen actually tells you "Ice possible, please drive with care" or reminds you that the blinker is on. All for less than $40k...try and get a Tahoe loaded for that!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven many different vehicles, having worked in the automotive field, but I'm very impressed with the GMC Acadia. It has the space of a mini-van but definitly not the look of one and it rides as smooth as a sedan with the ability of an SUV. GM hit it on the head this time. It's truly a vehicle that covers all the bases. Plus a 5yr- 100K warranty and roadside assistance, (some of imports don't even offer roadside unless you purchase it), how could you lose. I give it a big thumbs up. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The voice recognition system is amazing! Totally revamped from the previous software which wasn't anything to write home about. Also the versatility of the navigation system gives you many more features than the portables. Like address book and voice link to OnStar & hands free calling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Before buying the Acadia, we looked at the luxury options at BMW, Acura, Mercedes, and Lincoln. The Acadia offered similar features at a fraction of the cost. While the gas mileage isn't great, we get lots of enjoyment from the bose speakers, ipod jack, heated seats, dvd player, two sun roofs, OnStar navigation, hands-free calling through my Verizon service, remote start that automatically adjusts the interior temperature, and the best cup holders ever made. The design is sleek, and we notice everyone takes a look when we drive by. There is lots of room for our kids, their friends, and everything that comes with them. We like the car so much, we bought a second one just a few days later</TEXT>

<TEXT>Consumer Reports compares this vehicle to others in its medium class and gives the negative review of poor mileage. Really? Even though it has almost twice as much luggage capacity and 23 cu. foot more cargo capacity than the Highlander, more cargo capacity than the Mazda CX-9, Pilot and Taurus and more powerful engine than all except the Mazda, it still gets better mileage than all others named here or in its class. Moving and pulling more for less is a big deal. The Gross Vehicle Weight Rating is 6400 lbs and it beats its competitors there by 500 lbs. while getting a 16/24 mpg. rating.

<TEXT>I was torn between the MDX and the Arcadia. By the time I built similiar features there was only a $2000 price difference between the two . I believe the resale value will be an issue. The Arcadia rides very well but doesn't carry the prestige. You hear road noise and the transmission stinks. They don't have full leather seats (fabric on the corner of the front seats). The gas milege in the city is really bad. On the highway it's much better. I've only had the truck 2 weeks and wake up every morning questioning the decision. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The '08 Acadia is one solid XUV that met all my expectations and justifies the title, Made in USA (got rid of my German cars that had lots of reliability issues). The pitbull-like stance/exterior, interior design/ergonomics and handling are first-rate and deserve consideration by those looking for pax space and who don't want to drive a van. It feels like one solid block of wood no matter what the road surface is (I opted against the 19-inchers, w/c felt more jiggly and AWD, as my FWD felt quicker during the road test). The engine does have it's work cut out for it when prodded lightly but moves the Acadia with authority when you step on it. Cornering ability is impressive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Previously owned SUVs are a 1997 Tahoe and a 2000 Mountaineer, and additionally in the past 20 years we have owned vehicles from VW, Ford, Nissan, Volvo, Porche, and BMW. We are very much brand agnostic, so drove every available similar SUV. The Porche wasn't really a consideration, due to price, and wasn't an all around favorite anyway. We really liked Buick's sibling of the Acadia, but the local dealer didn't have one equipped the way we liked. I'd have a hard time rating any car a 10 in more than one or two categories, so I consider 9 excellent. This is an excellent all-around vehicle, but although pleasant to drive, I can't say fun-to- drive. Gas mileage has been in the 20 mpg range. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The nav system/dvd is fun. I really like the HUD, but would like more information than is available. Rear camera system should be standard on this SUV.

<TEXT>We only have 15000 KM/9000 mi This is a very comfortable vehicle and it handles very well on the road.The AWD is noisy when it engages to the point of annoying on slippery streets. The other feature that is very inconvenient is if you drive in snow or mud it collects on the inside of the wide rims and if it is below freezing puts the wheels out of balance. I have had to go to a car wash twice while travelling just to wash the rims out. the last time it viberated the car so bad I could not go over 40 mph.

The interior is very well designed and convenient. I haven't had any problems to date. I was worried about driving an SUV since I have only owned cars, but I feel absolutely safe and secure in this car. The kids love all the space in the back, and they also enjoy the ablity to play their own music or CD's. The fuel economy is ok I expect it to get better with more miles.

<TEXT>Got one of the first 2008 Acadia's and we love it! Replaced a Chrysler Town & Country. GM has done an excellent job with this vehicle, it continues to exceed our expectations. One minor problem with the power driver seat motor, but I won't take it back till it's time for the first oil change. Our gas mileage started out low - near 14 MPG but increased to near 18 MPG after 2500 miles. We have the AWD version. The heads-up display, nav and back-up camera work extremely well together. The sound system is also great. Only other wish was for bluetooth, but I'll add some aftermarket version - the rest of the vehicle is awesome, maybe the best vehicle we've ever owned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As I'm sure most of you did, researched extensively prior to purchasing a new 2008 Acadia SLT-2 AWD. Options: DVD Entertainment, Twin Sunroofs, Tow Package and 2nd row bench seats.We traded in our 05 Accord to get something bigger after the addition of our 2nd child and I am really glad we chose the Acadia. After driving and looking at at least 10 cars in this very over croweded (gd for consumers) market segment we decided on the Acadia becasue of its looks, feel and overall comfort.My wife has never driven an SUV before but is able to drive this cross- over with ease, although backing up (even with parking assist) is still a challenge.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The DVD entertainment is great for the kids and the skylights are very nice.

<TEXT>We spent six months testing and researching all of the so-called top crossovers - Lexus, Hyundai, Honda, Mercedes,Ford Edge, Lincoln, and Mazda. None of them could hold a candle to the Acadia in size, gas mileage, comfort, versatility, driving ease, quiet, and ride. I was really taken by the smoothness and quick acceleration despite being a 5,000 pound vehicle and the ride reminds one of a large luxury sedan but corners exceptionally well and not the least bit sluggish. I strongly recommend the seven passenger configuration as the best option - Like a living room on wheels. Your neighbors will hate you when you pull it into your driveway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love driving my new Acadia. I have no complaints about the ride, interior design, etc. I highly recommend it. The only downside is I am not getting the gas mileage I was told it should get. I am only getting 14 mpg. I took a trip with it and I expected to get 22-24 mpg but only got 18. There is a problem with the Acadia- if you park on an incline the computer gets confused on how much gas you actually have and your fuel gauge will show that you have less gas than you actually have.

<TEXT>I was so excited when we bought this vehicle, but it has turned into a love-hate relationship. I LOVE driving it, but the sunroof leaks and resulted in 3 inches of water under the insulation. After 5 months of back and forth into the shop without any luck in fixing it, the electric system has finally started to fail due to the water. GM has finally decided to negotiate a replacement. We are now considering the Honda Pilot. If we did get this car again, NO SUNROOF. Nothing but problems.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We loved our Acadia til the windshield leaked. When they fixed that, the back Windows leaked. Then the windshield would leak and then the back Windows would leak again. The ignition wouldn't work at times so you had to use the remote start to start the car and then the ignition would work. After numerous trips to our dealership, gmc did a buy back. Its a Nice car but they need to work out all the kinks in it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought a 08 FWD Acadia last year and really like it. It's been very reliable, build quality appears to be excellent (big suprise to me, I think GM has been making junk for years) and Driving dynamics are good such a large truck. No sqeaks, no problems whatsoever and we have 8K miles on it so far. Room is best of all the similar vehicles checked out other than mini van. Drove the CX9, the Ford Taurus X, Armada, Higlander, Pilot (real dissapointment), this was the winner. Only complaints, no backup camera (got aftermarket)and it really needs one. Cloth interior is wearing already and Mileage is not as advertised. Complaints about funky trany are overblown. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks great, Lots of Room and 7 Seat option is great for rear seat access. So far has been very reliable, and build quality is very good (no rattles, body panels line up etc..). Only GM car I ever owned (probably last once they fail, but i would buy on again). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought the Acadia after several good runs with the Yukon and Suburban vehicles. It is attractive and has ample room inside. But the FLAWS, my God. Cruise control failure in a module that kills the tail lights; sun roof leaks that short out the electrical systems; cheap PLASTIC everywhere inside. Poor visibility for parking front and rear. Ours has been in and out of the dealership MANY times; total time in shop in excess of 26 days since brand new. Not only can we NOT recommend an Acadia, we likely will never again purchase from GMC. Very little assistance from the base level to the top; there is a REASON GM is going BROKE--they are cranking out JUNK. Thousands of Acadias on lots.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>New and snazzy looks outside; rear seats are a nightmare and the sunroof leaks--just look on the internet--not just our vehicle, HUNDREDS of them, all GM factory defects which result in dealerships trashing out the interior trying to effect repairs then an unwillingness to fix what THEY BROKE. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I kept my old car for 12 years waiting for a car I liked. Loved the look of the Acadia when it came out so I researched it thoroughly and test drove it before purchasing the 2008 SLT 2 AWD in 2007(no DVD or Nav). I love it. My family of four drove from NJ to NC last summer, filled to capacity w/the cruise control on--22 mpg...not bad. I feel very safe driving this car at night. Headlights/fog lights really illuminate the road. The dome lights stay lit entering and exiting and the headlights, taillights and backup lights stay lit as well, giving full view around the car. Great in the snow and ice too--even on inclines and declines. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had our Acadia 1 year. We have an engine noise that can't be fixed. Dealership has changed motor mounts, air conditioner compressors, drained oil from the new air conditioner compressor and still the noise is present. The car used to accelerate great but now you must floor it to get the car to go anywhere. Seriously GMC, a brand new car should not be in the repair shop for 17 days in 1 month! We are going to either just cut our losses and eat the fact that the car depreciated $16K in 1 calender year or try our chances with the lemon law. I knew we should not have bought American!

<TEXT>When my '01 GMC YukonXL was needed as a farm vehicle, began the search for a new family car. We loved the drive and comfort of our previous GMC yet no longer needed the size of the YukonXL. In addition, with a 6'2" all leg 14 year old and another boy growing, comfort was key. Looked seriously at the Toyota Highlander (family discount available). The boys tested both for legroom and comfort and Acadia far superior. Second row bucket seats have more mobility to move forward and recline than Highlander. Third seat easily accessible and comfortable to average- sized adult while not compromising space. AWD fabulous! In recent 3' snow, drove superbly. Overall a quiet, smooth drive.</TEXT>

We traded in a Toyota Sequoia and we would never go back to that beast. The Acadia is much easier to drive around town and has enough room for our kids and our luggage. The mileage is as advertised as long as you go easy. The transmission does take some time to get use to, but after a while you stop noticing it. The backup camera is very helpful. The Acadia is great in the snow and has the best heated seats of any car I have owned. Extremely comfortable during long trips. The heads up display is great with the navigation system.</TEXT>

I have driven GMC Jimmys since 1988 and held off replacing my 2001 until I could find a satisfactory replacement. Tried all the competition, Acura, Higlander, Honda Pilot, Mitsubishi, Volvo, Ford's stuff, Dodge and Jeep. The Acadia outtrumps them all, even my wifes new MB ML350! Those who demean domestic carmakers need to go "looksee" and drive. Acadia is an excellent machine in every respect with just a few minor glitches, but great ride, handling, performance, quietness, interior, and content. Well done GM!

<TEXT>I have been looking for a car for several months. We are a family with four children, two in college, two in high school. While we thought we could downsize with two kids out of the house, we found we still need space in a vehicle for when everyone is home, moving into and out of dorm rooms, hauling around friends, etc. This SUV is the perfect size for that...not too big, but with room enough to comfortably seat 6 of us and the dog. I shopped around a lot! Looked at MDX, Volvo, VW, Mercury. The GMC was the best price of all other models I compared to. I love the ease of use of all the controls, visibility is great as well. Not a luxury interior, but practical and well designed. Love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In the less than a year that we have had our Acadia it has been in the shop 4-5 times! It's obvious that it was very poorly built. The driver's seat broke the 1st week, the wipers broke mid rain storm, the service airbag light, engine light, and oil light have all been on and had to be serviced. And there was a recall that had to be fixed! After all of this I finally get my vehicle back and hit a deer, which did $5500 worth of damage to the front end yet the air bag never went off and on-star never came on! The way it shifts is awful, the noise & vibrations when the windows are down is horrible and I am so sick of this vehicle. Now my tire pressure light is on- it is always something!</TEXT>

For a 40k car there is so much plastic inside. You expect it to be more luxurious but it's not. Have bluetooth, for God's sake we are in the 21 century. Premium sound system is so not premium, bearly giving sound. Guess they forgot to install the amp. The gas mileage is not so bad as long as you are babysitting it, but if you dare to push that pedal you will truly see the gas gauge is going down in front of your eyes, but that should be expected with a huge car like this.

<TEXT>We purchased our Acadia new with 5 miles on it. The problems began 1week later by having to have a new engine put in it! then the battery went dead a few months later and the OnStar didn't work to call for help. The traction control quit working and had to be fixed, then the cruise control quit working, then the battery went dead again while driving at night so we had no dash lights and not much of anything was working, so after 5 times of being in the shop lets hope it's all fixed, we should have a new car by now with all those new parts,oh wait, we did buy a new car. Comfortable ride when it runs, NAV doesn't work right, OnStar works sometimes, love it when everything works! Gimme a new one</TEXT>

<TEXT>Here is the review after 3 months of ownership and 3000 miles. The review is based on the maxed out SLT2 AWD (w/Nav & DVD). Overall the car is great. Nice ride, great seating, and seems sure footed on the road. Two complaints: Fuel economy - Don't believe the hype! We do City/Hwy driving. Avg mpg is 12 city, 16 hwy. To me, that's terrible for a V6 and compared to what GMC boasts of 20/22. The other complaint is the nav & backup camera has failed on a few separate occasions. Went back to the dealer and they will replace it. To sum it up, the Acadia is a nice car, good overall build and quality, layout. But misleading on the gas mileage. </TEXT>

After buying Japanese for the past eight years, we braved the "American Front" once again! My only real concern is that there are multiple blind spots, so I am a little paranoid when backing up, and when changing lanes. You get used to checking a lot. We have loved the comfort, and always receive ooohs and ahhhs when people ride in the Acadia. Handles great, especially for the size, and you feel very safe inside, even in inclement weather.

The only thing I have found wrong with this car is the clothes hooks, instead of being at the back door they have been installed at the third seat and is impossible to hang clothes or reach them. This is the only car I have ever seen this in. I have had this car two month and just turned 7000 miles. I have not had a chance to see out the car tracks in snow.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As I thought about it more, I thought I could give you a little bit more color on my experience with the Acadia. As I said, the topline summary is that I love it, but here are some more details about my experience: Very quiet -- probably the quietest car at freeway speeds that I've ever owned. Powerful drivetrain -- for a car of it's size, it really gets up and goes. You have to be careful, because with how quiet and powerful it is, you can be going 80 MPH and it feels like 65. Comfortable -- this is a personal thing, but for me, it works great for long trips. I drove back from Utah in a day, and was comfortable the whole way. Gas mileage -- I get about 16 to 25 MPG depending</TEXT>

<TEXT>We recently bought the Acadia because we wanted a car with better gas mileage than our Expedition. Big disappointment. We are only getting about 12 mpg. Since the sticker advertised 16 city/24 highway, you can imagine my surprise when I only got 12. The car is beautiful in design and interior layout is excellent. But if you're looking for a wonderful car with great gas mileage, buy something else. I will be getting rid of this car as soon as possible. Looks aren't everything and if GMC can't do better than to make a vehicle with such poor gas mileage, they should stop making them. I'll take my Expedition back anyday.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We choose the Acadia because it had so many of the features we were looking for and I wanted to drive something new and reliable. The Acadia has met many of my needs, but reliability is not one of them. In the 4 months we?ve had the car it?s been to the dealership 3 times. They had to replace the right cylinder head because of cam shaft end play. Now, I am uncomfortable driving a car that had to have the engine dropped at 6,000 miles for a major repair. A disappointment on a $39K car. I do agree with many of the reviewers that say there is a lack of power at slow speeds when climbing an incline. However, we were fairly happy with the Acadia?s performance when towing a U-Haul trailer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our "barely used" 2008 Acadia 3 weeks ago. It had 9600 miles on it when we bought it and we have put cose to 1000 miles on it in the time we have had it. So far, we feel that this is an awesome vehicle. We have averaged right around 20 mpg in both city and hwy driving, and have experienced none of the transmission problems that so many reviews mention. This vehicle is definately an improvement over the 2002 Ford Windstar it replaces. The only gripe I have is the poor rear visability. A back up camera would be nice to have.</TEXT>

This is our first "American" badged vehicle and have to say that we are both impressed. Ours was purchased in Nov 07 and with the exception of a leaky sunroof (fixed under warranty) we have had no problems during its first 7500 miles driven. The May 08 transmission reflash was done two months ago and did wonders for the everyday drivability of the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Acadia was a Christmas gift for my wife. She fell in love with the looks so we never test drove prior to delivery. We are satisfied with the vehicle except for the 6 speed transmission. In moderately hilly driving the transmission changes gears from 3-4-5 constantly. The shifts happen after the vehicle slows down 5- 10 MPH and then the engine speeds up from 1800 RPM's to 3500 RPM's to bring the vehicle back to the speed desired. The shifts are herky jerky and to date the dealer and calls to GM Customer Care has brought about the same response, "That is the way they are". The software developers should drive the vehicles in various road conditions and go back to the drawing board.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned our Acadia for about 13k miles. We selected it over the Acura MDX primarily due to its 3rd row space. Though we had some trepidation about the alleged poor reliability of American cars, I can say that for equivalent miles, the Acadia has been far more reliable than my 2005 Infiniti G35 or my VW Passat. I have had absolutely no reliability issues with the Acadia, while I can't say the same about the others. I was initially concerned about the fuel economy, and I have found the economy to be a mixed bag: city mileage is poor at about 11-14 mpg, but on the highway it is easy to achieve 24mpg by staying <70mph and using the cruise control. This is surprising for a big vehicle.</TEXT>

Finally convinced my husband to take a test drive. Loved the seating, dual moon roofs, and great room. Made the purchase 6 months ago and it is very aggravating. When the warmer months come around, I roll down my back windows-you can't do this at all in this vehicle! The vibration is so awful it is like you are directly under a helicopter. Made a complaint to GMC, told it was a design issue. The transmission shifting is more than awful! Overall a nice vehicle if they change the transmission and noise issues, but miss my Tahoe.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We usually bury our vehicles, so after 14 yrs and 150k miles on our '94 Explorer we decided it was time. Looked at all the SUVs including Acadia's two siblings, the Saturn Outlook and the Buick Enclave but picked the GMC. So far we love it! Great inside and out, and the ride is perfect. Two things stand out. We are only getting 19.8 mpg on the highway which is about 10% less than the 22 mpg advertised, whic is the same as my '94 Explorer was getting. Next, I find that on hills especially it hesitates getting into high gear and I have to push down hard on the gas pedal until it slips into high gear, this is very annoying. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I reviewed and searched for the perfect crossover and I found it in the GMC Acadia. I had an Acura MDX and it was giving me mechanical problems. I said I would never purchase an American car. GMC has changed our minds! We have always purchased foreign and the GMC line has really turned us around. Thanks GMC for a wonderful ride that turns heads as well as makes us smile. My daughter loves lookingt through the 2nd row sun roof especially at night and watching her long awaited DVD player. My in-laws love that we can have them along since it seats 6 comforably and 7 with a small child on the third row. Only will trade for a new one. It's everything I thought it would be and more.

<TEXT>To everyone mentioning the transmission, the 5/8/08 transmission flash is a must. You actually feel the 275hp of the engine and don't have to push the pedal down much. It's the way it should have been from the factory. Tons of room inside. I got the 2nd row captain's chairs. Where can you get those outside of minivan? 3rd row better than most vehicles and has 60/40 which is great. Power liftgate and rear backing sensors are excellent. Stereo system (with XM) very nice. OnStar provides nice security. Stylish exterior and underrated style inside. Large tires and off-road capability. All-wheel drive is passive but there if needed. Dual sunroofs. The total package, IMHO. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded off my 2000 Durango for this '08 Acadia and I am disappointed in that the Acadia leaks in a lot of dirt on our rural roads, mostly around the liftgate. A lot of dirt collects between the two rows of weatherstripping around the 2nd-row doors, also, so much that you sure don't want to lean against that area with clean clothes on. I also do not care for the constant shifting of the transmission. My Durango had a 4.7 and I really miss it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The air conditioning is very good on even the hottest of days, and the 2nd row passengers have more than enough legroom. Our old Durango was short in these areas.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We traded in a Honda Pilot for the features offered by the Acadia, the primary one being the dual climate control. The particular model we purchased has basically everything, so we are very pleased with that. However, the engine performance is less than desirable and the constant shifting of the transmission, based on changes in the road, etc., especially with the cruise control on, is very annoying. It's as if the transmission and/or engine can't decide how to power the vehicle down the road. Pushing the accelerator slowly doesn't get you much. The gas mileage is high teens, averaging around 18 - not the greatest. Certainly has all the bells and whistles. A very stylish vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dual climate control, the navigation system, backup camera and sensor system, the heads up display and the airplane like cockpit setting of the driver's area, all make this vehicle exciting to drive. Also like the automatic opening/closing rear tailgate and the remote engine start. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We looked at all the current cross-overs, in the end this is the largest and in terms of efficiency, same or better as the rest. In comparison to imports, it runs on regular which is a huge plus, fuel econ better than MDX & X5. Versitility is tops; 2nd row captains and 3rd row bench easily accomodate adults and any kind of gear you want to store. Switched from smaller car, still adjusting to size. On the road, feel as big or bigger than minivans, but not as large as full size SUV's and some mid size SUV's. Getting 19.5 overall with a mix of 60% highway and 40% city. Driving close to posted limit, long highway trips getting 21, hope to improve once the AC goes off this fall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were so happy when we bought our Acadia. Great looks, power, and felt solid. After we bought the car we learned how bad the fuel economy was. I also noticed the hesitation up hills. Throttle response is terrible if you step on it. At 8,000 miles check engine light came on. Service center told us fuel cap and camshaft problem? Camshaft? Only 8,100 miles on this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had our Acadia for about 10 months and I still really love it. It has a nice ride and it's very easy to maneuver, especially for it's size. Very comfortable and huge cargo space with the seats down. We had to find a vehicle that would accommodate three kid's car seats. Being able to walk around the 2nd row seats to access the 3rd row was a huge thing for us (seat won't fold w/ car seat installed). The tranmission is a mess, however! It makes it very difficult to accelerate smoothly to try to save on gas. My MPG avg. is 15.5. I am also having trouble with the Stabilitrak and opening one of the 2nd row windows at highway speed is a very scary experience. Overall we love our Acadia.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, the 2008 GMC Acadia is a great vehicle. One thing I don't like is there is not a dome light when you exit the vehicle. Another downfall is the gas mileage, it's not horrible but definitely not what they said it would be.They said it would get 18+, really I get 15- 16mpg, but the luxury is worth it. Everything else has been great for me, no problems with the shifting as I have heard others complain about. Also, the AC vents dont seem to hit me when I am driving. The vents are made for taller people. I am 5'6" so not too short.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We really like our Acadia because of how it looks and it drives really nice, great turning ratio, very comfortable! We have 5 kids including 3 teenagers and we all fit in here with plenty of room. More leg and body room than our Suburban but we miss the storage room in the back. We have the FWD and are only getting 20 MPG and we drive mostly highway so that's a little disappointing. The vehicle is very doggy on hills unless you lay into the gas and then it wants to fly. Agree about the chrome on the dash, would be better to just make it the color of the dash as the sun does reflect off of it. We love the syling and people are always looking at it and even ask us how we like it, etc.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car expecting much better gas mileage than my 2004 Ford Expedition with a 540 horse V-8 engine. Sad to say, my Ford had better gas mileage in town than this Acadia. I only get around 10 miles per gallon in town. I do quite a bit of stop / start traffic, but it shouldn't be this bad. When I drive, I try to excercize all the gas efficient ways to drive, ie. don't drive with a heavy foot, don't stop quickly say at a light, slow exceleration from a stop, no gunning it up a hill, etc. The transmission is a bit sluggish. It tends to be delayed when trying to go up a hill. I really like the car and it's quite stylish, too! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my 2008 Acadia for going on 1 year. Since December 2007 we have had countless problems with the vehicle. the service stabilitrak and service traction control lights come on every 2 weeks or so. It is July now and this morning the light came on and my car shut off on the highway. The dealership never can figure out what is happening with the vehicle. It has put a "sour taste" in our mouths about the GMC brand. I had 3 young children in my car when this happened. It is in the shop again and hopefully it can be remedied. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the Acadia. I enjoy the drive. The body is bold and stands out. Love all the little extras. DVD, leather seats, and of course the sunroof. The car is an attention getter. It is easy to drive and easy to turn. The rear camera is wonderful when parking. It has enough room on the inside for everyone and you do not feel cramped up. You still feel like you are in a car but you are high like a truck with the room of a SUV! I love it and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a fun-loving family friendly car that still turns heads! Thumbs up to GMC. Just work on the transmission and auto start! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather seats, seat warmers! DVD. Rear controls so my daughter can listen to her own music! Rear camera, push open gas cover. Controls for the radio/navigation/cruise on the steering wheel.

<TEXT>We're very pleased with our new Acadia in all respects except for one - the transmission shifts weird, especially under light acceleration. It seems to shift too early under light acceleration which then has a negative effect on acceleration. The shifts almost seem like it is skipping a gear. RPMs will go from over 3000 down to under 2000 in a single shift resulting in a significant loss in power. It doesn't seem like the transmission utilizes the 270hp fully, typical of a GM product in my experiences. It acts like it has a 100hp engine unless you put your foot on the floor and then it takes off like a spring chicken. Mileage has been respectable for this size of vehicle, 21.5 hyw.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had our Acadia about three weeks now, and love it. After having Expeditions and Suburbans it was a shock to go down, but the car is great. Seats are all very comfortable, and so far the tranny hasn't been an issue for us. Kids love it too. Have to agree with folks on the cupholders and outlet up front. They need at least one more plug or even two on the side of the console so you can plug things in without blocking the front cupholder. Mileage is about what we expected (15 so far with heavy city driving) Great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Boght the car with future plans on bigger family. Gas mileage and prices have killed that idea! Average about 12/16 city/highway in Hawaii. Love the truck almost as much as anything I have ever owned and never would think I could find a better designed or planned American built vehicle in this class. It sits in the garage most of the time however due to the very poor mileage but when we do drive it, it is almost as much fun than the actual destination. If you love comfort, space, quality and having people's heads turn this is the vehicle for you. If you hate paying out the yang for gas, don't even entertain it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When my new Acadia had 1800 miles the check engine light came on. Took it to the dealership and they had to replace the head and both camshafts!! At 2100 miles the check engine light came on. They said the gas cap was loose and even though we repeatedly removed the cap and replaced it, the check engine light would not go off. They had to reprogram the computer to get the light to go off. To compound the misery I'm only getting 17-19 mpg with 90% of my driving being on the turnpike using the cruise control! They say they can do nothing about the gas mileage but it should get better around the 10,000 mile mark!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>To start out on the positive I love the look and the interior design of the vehichle. However, I am extremely disappointed in the drive. It has problems going up even the smallest of hills without downshifting. When you are trying to pick up speed and merge into traffic you have hesisation and downshifting. I have had it serviced and it improved the hesitation somewhat but the downshifting leads to the worst driving car I have ever owned. The gas mileage is also awful. I am only getting 13.9 around town. For a vehicle with a sticker over $40,000 I think GMC should be ashamed of itself!</TEXT>

The remote start doesn't work from more than twenty feet away. The outdoor thermometer can be off by more than five degrees and you have to put the vehicle in "Park" to display more than five locations on the navigation system when looking for a gas station or resturant. They tell me engineering is working on the thermometer and remote start and the Nav sytem problem is a safety feature.

Other than the popping at take off no problems and I hope once it breaks in the fuel economy will get better.

The parking assist is also handy (the back glass is up high and you don't have the best view of the back). Gas mileage could be better but what do you expect, it is an SUV...well worth the room in my opinion.
