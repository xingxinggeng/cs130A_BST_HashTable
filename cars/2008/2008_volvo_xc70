<TEXT>We've had this car for just shy of two years and have always liked it much more than the auto mag reviewers. It fits our family's needs perfectly. It's my wife's daily driver and she appreciates the tank like solidity and the overall sense of quality it exudes. The front seats may be the most comfortable of any car out there, especially for long trips. We make many trips to the ski slopes a year and the AWD makes this Volvo unstoppable. The boxy interior configuration is very efficient, great for hauling all sorts of stuff. A great ?does it all? vehicle. Not particularly sporty or fuel efficient but very luxurious. That?s why we?re getting another now that our lease is coming to an end.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD, Solidity, Rational uncluttered controls, comfortable leather seats, overall vehicle size. You would have to go for a much more expensive Wagon, SUV or Crossover from Audi, BMW or Mercedes to get this level of quality. A good value. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The XC 70 is one of the best cars that I ever bought. It is amazing on snow/ice. It's just as good as a Subaru on bad condition or if not better. It handles like crazy. I feel very safe in it also. Volvo makes some of the most safest cars. I just love it!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Solid car protected me during off- set/head-on 55 MPH collision on 101 north of Hopland, CA. Other driver decided to make a u-turn on 101! Car took the crash well. Felt like I was in a vault. Slightly underpowered, needs turbo. Got same model again with more options. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We recently purchased the 2008 XC70 after an exhausted search. The ride is exceptional and the seat are very comfortable. We are averaging 21mpg which we fell is reasonable. The build quality so far is also exceptional, not a rattle or the slightest defect to be found after two months. The park assist is excellent giving parking assist on front, back and sides. Radio and speakers are very good. I like the fact that the controls are very clear, easy to locate and only the controls you really need on the steering wheel -- cruise control on one side and radio on the other side. Overall we are exceptionally happy with our purchase </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had this car for a few weeks but I love it. Selected it, narrowly, over a Subaru Outback Limited because of the extra rear seat room and trunk space. This car has a beautiful fit and finish, both inside and out. The controls are well laid out and ergonomic. It lacks good acceleration but the engine has real power on the highway. It's no sports car, but drives nicely, is quiet, and luxurious. After suffering through five years with an Audi Allroad that was a mechanical nightmare (just say no!) I am expecting a much better experience with this car. So far, so good. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased new. Basic model with no options. Very comfortable interior, great seats, clear controls. Reasonable acceleration, sounds fine, smooth transmission. Average fuel economy for weight and off road capability. Well built and feels solid with lots of airbags. Plenty of space. Floaty ride, but comfortable and seems reasonable for a cross over.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am so happy I bought this car. It handles beautifully in the snow and is very comfortable. The only negative I have found is the sun visors. They are not wide enough. The gap between the visor and the pillar is enough to cause a blinding glare. When they are straight down, they obscure the road. Other than that, everything is perfect. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The leather is very soft. The Dynaudio stereo is far nicer than what was standard in my previous car. The car does not slip at all on snow or ice. The back seats are even comfortable. Tail gate is easy to open/close. Specific key remembering specific seat position is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just upgraded my 08 XC70 with a new 08 XC70. Added more options, like Dyna audio, BLIS, Adaptive cruise and 17" wheels. Chose Black/Black instead of Oyster/Tan. It feels like I am in a completely different car. Where the other one was nice, this feels more like a luxury automobile. I am so much happier with this car. My first was an early production and this one seems to be tighter, put together better and has a much higher quality feeling to it. I put over 12K on my last one in over 4 months and never warmed up to it. I can see keeping this one for much longer</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Adaptive cruise is pretty cool! The Dyna audio with Sirius is a must. I thought BLIS was kind of a gimmick at first, but you get used to it and wonder why it's not offered on more cars. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my third Volvo. Previous to this car was an 02 XC70 and an 850 turbo. My experience with the 08 model is not something to write home about. The fuel economy of this car (avg 13.8L/100kms) is far less than the 2002 and the increase in HP does little to affect performance. Personally I prefer the older turbo model. I also like the center stack from the old model as it was slightly turned towards the driver. Other than cosmetic, there is very little about this car that is better than the previous model. The car is not as quiet nor as tight. I currently have 13K kms on this car and it has been back to the dealer five times for warranty repair. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My previous 7 vehicles were VWs so changing to Volvo was a leap. I had an S40 T5 AWD for 6 months before "surprise" 2nd child arrived. Traded for the XC70 for the added room. The ride on this car is excellent for it's class. It feels more like a luxury sedan and less like an SUV. Compared to my previous Passats it feels much roomier which is great for our family of 4. The built-in DVD players are a big hit! (DVD+R work just fine.) It's exactly the kind of solid, thoughtful, classy vehcile that I would expect from a Volvo. I average 18 mpg under mixed driving conditions (22 mpg higway) using a responsible "kids in the car" driving style and 89 octane gas.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling, adaptive cruise control is now a must have feature for me, 3-blink directional signal when tapped, seats are comfortable, folding side mirrors, parking assist works great but would like to set it as an "opt-in" feature rather than an "opt- out".</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've had Volvo sedans before, put this is our first wagon. It's a tank. I can't imagine a sturdier, more substantial vehicle. It's outstanding in rain and you're 100% confident in matters of traction and handling all the time. Amazingly comfortable overall. My issues? A perpetual rattle in the cargo area. Had it serviced, but the fix lasted only one day. Going back in again soon. Mileage? I had to shut off the display so I wouldn't cry- -long stretches on local roads at 6MPG. I probably average 16MPG overall. Would I recommend it? Yes, but think hard if you're mostly puttering around town because of the mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this in April and I am very sensitive to transmission quirks . It hunts incessantly from gear to gear indecisively making me a bit uncomfortable. I never felt confident and the mpg is not near the perf we should get. . I kept getting the runaround from the dealer saying its an "adaptive" trans. and would smooth out after break in , but I know cars and was upset 4 months later- gas mileage under 20 I finally snapped sold it on craigslist saying we were moving . Yeah moving from one car to another . The Volvo was true to its FORD bones-poor-power to weight. We got an Audi A4 - Like night and day- some sap got the VOLVO- Volvos now I know what all the hupla is about- nothing! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a new XC70 in April, so I haven't had a chance to test it in snow and ice. I do a mix of city and highway driving and have averaged 24 MPG. The car handles well and is nice to drive, although I find the transmission hunting for gears sometimes. I had heard that the transmission is adaptive so that this may stablilize once it adjusts to my driving style. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seats are really comfortable and supportive. The Blind Spot System has saved me on both the highway and from many New York cabs. Park Assist is convenient for street parking.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the XC70 after extentsive research. Having other Volvo's I appreciate the new design: smaller exterior size but larger interior space. Rear leg room is fine as long as the 6-plus footers can compromise a little. Mileage has improved to 23 hywy at 73mph. Performance is great in the high rpm range: paddle shifting works great when passing. We drive to ski county each weekend and frequently encounter snow and slop which the XC handles effortlessly, but I see it could be easy to become overconfident. There is some jerky-ness when initially stepping on the accellerator. For what this car is intended to do, it does very, very well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this vehicle! Was a bit hesitant as I moved from a Mercedes E500 and thought I'd miss the HP & luxury but the Volvo has far exceeded expectations. I drive through Colorado about 50K/year and with Blizzak tires, the Volvo is extremely dependable & secure. I will drive 600 miles in one day and finish refreshed & happy. Averaging 24 MPG on non-premium gas. Certainly not a race car - but you should know that going in. Two thumbs up. Only complaint, the key stinks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned this car for almost 3 months. It has some features that I love like, the PCC, BLIS and some other gadgets. The mileage is pretty bad, they really need to do something about it or bring the diesel model. Even you get better mileage with the BMW 5 series. The performance is just OK, at high RPM makes too much noise and the car reacts kind of slow when you press the gas, once you are cruising on the highway everything goes smooth and it handles pretty well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>PCC, BLIS, DVD rear entertainment system. Interior and exterior design. Pretty comfortable family car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>1. The 235 hp engine is high on torque but low on kick. Acceleration comes with pretty noticable noise that is at least two notches louder on the car radio scale (i.e. you have to tune the radio louder by at least that much to hear the same volume) 2. NOTE THIS: in a stop-and-go situation (e.g. congested highway), you may feel not-infrequent jerking. It is as if the auto transmission doesn't know which gear to engage. This is particularly so if you just let go the brake or tap on the gas slightly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It is even better than I expected. The interior is all of a piece, with those wonderful Volvo seats. The controls are similar to the last 2002 XC70 we had, rewarding the repeat customer. There is no flimsy dash mounted cupholder like the old XC70! The car seats 4 in absolute comfort. We had a way-back third seat in the old XC70, but not on this one, we almost never used it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats, transmission, instrument panel. The exterior looks of this car are remarkable. It looks great parked in the garage. Handles well, accelerates smoothly, much better than XC90 (my wife's decision factor). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Excellent safety features. Handles well. Wife feels very good about safety and handling with the children. Good storage space in rear. Auto rear door an excellent feature. Even though the gas mileage is marginal I believe the overall car features offset that and make it an excellent family vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design is good and it rides well. Seems roomier than the 2004 model we had and feels stronger with better handling. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car only has 1950 miles on it and it was in the shop four times for a clunking/popping sound coming from the front end on turns and some rattles. I think they may have finally fixed it by replacing the front subframe rear bushings and both control arms. I love the luxurious ride and interior but the gas mileage is only averaging 18 at best and that is with 50-75% highway. The car has some nice features such as the Blind Spot Warning System, Personal Car Communicator and remote tailgate. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The 08 XC70 is very comfortable and has some nice features such as the keyless entry and go, Blind Spot Warning System and power tailgate. It is a nice looking wagon although I am not a fan of the black plastic cladding on the sides. The interior is very comfortable and clean looking. My car started off with rattles and a clunking and popping sound coming from the front end. Most of the rattles were toned down by the service department. The front end issues has caused the car to be in the shop four times and it is currently there today. It is our first winter storm and I had to drive out Prius to work :-(. Volvo has been no help with the front end issue. I have 1900 miles on the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car and my first Volvo; we traded in our 2004 Acura MDX. After shopping for all the luxury SUVs from Acura to Mercedes, we decide on the Volvo XC70. The XC70 is more cars like and delivers great responsiveness. Safety, build quality and interior appointments are first rate. We have downsized in the past from a Lincoln Navigator to an Acura MDX to the Volvo XC70. This is the perfect size with the most comfortable ride and interior. Acceleration and handling is more than adequate and better than rated by the experts. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Ever since giving up on the Chrysler because of its poor performance and gas guzzling tendencies, this vehicle provides the ideal alternative. Better cachet and a much more maneuverable package, the Volvo matches or exceeds all the Pacifica benefits, then goes further with laser enhanced cruise control, satellite stereo, built-in child seats, and a really effective bluetooth system. still, I wish it were more economical.</TEXT>
