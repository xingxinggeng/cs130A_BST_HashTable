<TEXT>I'll agree with the editor's reviews that the low-end torque is an issue. She's just a bit slow off the starting line, but she shines once she's on the road. There's plenty of pedal when you need it, and I think she runs the best slightly above the recommended speed limit. I've owned Toyota's, BMW's and of course American cars. The Audi is my favorite to date. You won't be sorry, if you go this direction. I'm always getting compliments on this car, yet you don't feel too "cocky" driving it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The MMI is awesome. Passing power on the highway is terrific. Highway mileage has been much better than expected. I had a 6 hour drive recently and was getting 31 MPG!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've been a Volvo family for over 15 years and decided to "step up" to an Audi after thorough research and test drives. The car is beautify, spacious, and has more gadgets than we need but the kids love it. The ride is spectacular. However, in just 14 months we have had to take the car back 5 times for check engine light. One of the Cylinders (#5) they tell us is bad. The car has stalled on my wife stranding her and my daughter at the side of the road. We are delighted with their road-side assistance and loaner program but frankly miffed that we've had to use it about every other month. At this time we are not happy with our decision. I also see others have had the same issue.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth ride, solid feel, front appearance is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have a fully loaded Q7 and love it for its size and looks. But my husband has wanted another Audi so we went out and got a fully loaded A6. Could not be happier with it. After being pleased with Audi we went out and got another one a R8 for the power. But out of all of the cars we like the A6 the best for its looks and power and all the stuff you can get on it. Such as Keyless go (we payed extra to get that installed) Navigation, backup camera, and sensors, the blinds in the back, wood steering wheel. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Previously had a BMW 5 and loved it. No problems. Decided to try the A6 and am very pleased. Performance is more than I expected and the quality of the car's interior is impressive. The car is very quite and seems well built. Handling is great as is the fuel mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>From the outside to the inside, the A6 has beautiful features. The interior is plush and comfortable. The seat positions take you from a sports car feel to an executive luxury car. The MMI & sound system is fantastic, but I'm disappointed that the iPod integration is not on voice activation. Took a few days to master, but once understood, the MMI is easy to operate.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior features are excellent. The best time to drive the car is at night when all the dash lights are on. Voice activation is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love the exterior classy lines, interior is beautiful. The Bose sound system and iPod integration is fantastic. However the jury is still out on the handling. The car seem to have a lot of play in the steering and very poor weight distribution, also I find the car to have poor visibility. The Navigation System and Blue Tooth leaves a lot to be desired. (German car engineers should take note of Japanese technology). The S line looks great with its wider tires, but has very stiff seats. All in all the car feels very solid, and luxurious.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sensational looks inside and out, the amazing Bose sound system and iPod integration. Love the light accents in the cabin and outside front doors (must set these). Great acceleration in S gear. Audi A6 has a fabulous Solid feel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I spent over a month researching and test driving midsize luxury cars and when it was all done, the Audi A6 was the clear winner. About 6 weeks later we have no regrets. It's styling and build easily surpass its competitors. The MMI is not that difficult to learn. My wife, no techie, but has mastered it and is now a big fan of the system. It just takes a little patience to learn a new way of doing things. iPod interface is excellent and the NAV system is very well implemented. Lane assist is a great safety feature and works well. I much prefer the Audi to BMW, MB or Lexus. For us, the runner up was the Infinity M35.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quattro, MMI, great iPod interface, 2 screen NAV system, exterior and especially interior styling and finish, really quiet and smooth on highway, MPG is excellent with V6, lane assist, keyless entry, rearview camera and sensors, great trunk. lighting accents in cabin at night</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>3rd Audi, and extremely happy with how the deign has matured. Smooth cornering, pick up, quiet cabin, butter start up process, intuitive controls. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Look (Brilliant Black with Amaretto Brown), stereo sound, S-Line interior upgrade. Nice car, however Audi still has "annoying" small improvements, not big enough to stop me from buying, but from a practical perspective reaching to the glove compartment for CD/iPod connection is "stupid"!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Reading good reviews by the editor as well as some owners, my daughter decided to give it a try...I wish she did not. The car has 10,500 miles on it. It is 1.5 years old. She came here to Milwaukee for a funeral. On the way from Chicago the yellow light came on. As soon as she got out of the highway the car stalled. She called the road assistance as well as the leasing company and they told her to try starting it. The car started. They told her that since this is just the yellow light drive it and bring it in when you are back. On the way to the funeral the car stalled again 3 times! She had to borrow mine, left the car parked on the street. This is the Audi/German luxury </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Audi A6 and the 2008 sure does beat out my old '00 A6. Everything is much improved. I avg. 31 MPG on the highway and 18 in the city. The only thing I truely miss is the ol' twin turbo. It would have been nice to have it again. This is a very solid care. Great stereo. By far the best cruise control I have ever seen. The NAV is a must, extremely accurate and again one of the best I've seen. Handling is tight as you dive into turns. I've had many 4 wheel drive trucks and cars and I can assure you this car with stock tires never fails me while traveling through the Pocono Mtns in PA. The brakes are undescribable. The car stops on a dime. Excellent car! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Couldn't be happier with the car. Considered the normal peers (E350 4matic, 530x, Acura RL, M35x, etc). Drove them all but felt that the A6 was the best overall package - drive, interior and exterior styling, options/ capabilities, etc) - and importantly at the most attractive price. Have owned BWM (330ci), Audi (A4), Acura (Legend) and spent a lot of time in MB (E) and Lexus (GS). Like my A6 better than any of them. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>A6 3.2 QUATTRO</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Overall the A6 is an excellent car. I have had it for a week and I'm in love everything about the car. The only thing I don't really like is the cupholders, not very conviniently located but no biggie. It doesn't have many places to put stuff though, glove compartment is rather small and center arm rest is small also. Other than that the car is awesome. Would have liked a wooden steering wheel standard for such a high price car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Past vehicles include Lexus, BMW, Porsche and this one ranks right up there with the. Got rid of BMW 330CI convertible and SUV for one year round vehicle and this is the perfect fit. Was concerned about lack of power, but dropping it down into sport mode completely changes the character of this car. ( the "S" under the "d" in the tranny is not 2nd it is sport mode). Handling is fantastic and a blast to drive on curvy, winding roads. Not sure what a prior post was talking about, however, I have v6 not the v8. This 4 door sedan is as fun to drive as my BMW convt. Smooth,comfortable, stable, classy, elegant, sporty, roomy and AWD for these WI winters. Average 29mpg on a 250 mile trip. Not much to complain about, I like this car more than I imagined I would. Thought I was sacrificing sport/fun for year round comfort. I did not.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the MMI - a little bit of a learning curve, but now can operate it blind. Nav., great sound system, gas mileage without giving up performance. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had MBs 280, 380, 560, 430, 600 BMWs 740 (2), Porsche Carrera 4, Maserati and others, oh and of course an Audi S4 - and I think I have finally grown up, at least it feels like it. This is a car that feels any bit as nice, maybe better, as my 2002 MB 430S, both ergonomically, aestetically and has more gadgets than I need, but I use them all, bluetooth, i-pod, Nav system (far out) and has a great ride. Ok, so the 6 Cyl. may not be a V8, but it is plenty peppy and I am happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at all cars that could possibly fit my criteria. I wanted top performance in a 4 wheel drive car. I finally settled on the A6. Although this car is fantastic in so many ways,the lack of road feel and poor wieght distribution is very unsettling. I can't understand why they would build a great car, but which lacks basic handling characteristics. My daughter's '06 Accord has much better road feel and handling characteristics than this car. I would even go so far as to say this car is quite dangerous if you try to drive it on a curvy road at high speed. The V8 is too much power for the poor handling. I am very dissapointed I wish I would have gone with the BMW</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2008 A6 replaced my 2001 A6. While the 2001 A6 was a solid car, Audi has upped their game significantly with the 2008. The build quality is outstanding - equal or better than my wife's MB E320. The interior is beautiful, a great blend of class and high tech. The car is very fun to drive, tight in turns, plenty of pep for a V6 and the MPG is far better than the the gov't ratings - 26/27mpg in mixed driving, 30+mpg on the road. The MMI system with the Bose/Sirius is easy to use, and the high tech display is excellent. The cabin is very quiet, so you can really enjoy the great sound system - great improvement from the Audi Symphony system in my 2001 A6. Overall, this is a terrific car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had the car for about 6 months and it is a perfect family wagon. It has plenty of room for a family of four and a dog. It gets about 25 mpg in mixed driving and 29 on a recent highway trip. I have been a Japanese car fan for the last 10 years after several BMWs left me wanting something with less maint. down time. I saw that the Audi reliability ratings were getting to a point that I felt comfortable giving an Audi a try. It's only been 6 months, but so far not one problem. We also live in New England and wanted all wheel drive, but we didn't want a truck. It was great in the snow and handles like a sports car on the dry pavement.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was in the market for an all-wheel drive german executive car, so my choices were the MB E350 4Matic, BMW 535xi, or the Audi A6 3.2, and I went with the Audi. And I really think I made the right choice. I don't like the idea that underneath it's a Passat, but the interior styling is unmatched and look nothing alike. The Quattro system works beautifully in all conditions. I'm getting about 31MPG average, which is great for this sized car. I'm just slightly disapointed with the acceleration. When merging on a highway(especially in NJ!), it's somewhat lazy and throttle response isn't as immediate as I hoped for. Like all Audi.s, the ride is firm, so beware of long trips. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Audi SatNav is wondeful. Heated seats can melt your bottom in minutes. Quattro system. Solid ride and feel. Roomy back seats. Large trunk. Fuel comsumption. Nice engine sound (when it feels its ready to rev) Great handling. Hasn't gone wrong once. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My third A6 offers loads of improvements over its earlier siblings. Ride is significantly more solid. Handling is so precise it's like a vacuum sucking the backtop. Engine performance is powerful and at least 10% more economical than the 3.0 in my previous 2003 A6. Views are stimulating from approaching the vehicle to behind the wheel. Several minor cost cutting steps should be noted: more narrow seats and thinner cushions than the previous models, door pockets are "cheaper," manual fuel filler door replaces and automatic release, head restrants no- longer swivel. I also miss oil temp. and volt gauges. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MultiMedia Interface (MMI) which allows customization of passive vehicle features and controls radio and bluetooth/telephone functions are in easy reach and easy to learn. Cruise is more intuitive. Design and assembly details both in and out beats everything else in its class.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Audi A6 and this is an entirely new vehicle that was redesigned from the bottom up. On a 350 mile trip at avg speed of 75mph I got 30 MPG! Quiet cabin, great ergonomics,and the NAV is the best I have ever seen. The sound system is fantastic. Headlights are improved. I did find the sunroof to be a little small but it is not as important compared to all the positives.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation. Stereo. Awesome headlights. Cruise control features are much improved. Heated steering wheel is very nice. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Driving dynamics are brilliant. The car rides like a train on the rails. There is no slipping nor sliding. Quattro system makes sure of that. Every mechanical component works in total harmony with each other. The interior appointments must be an envy of every other automaker. From the incredible ergonomics to the impeccable attention to the slightest details, this car clearly is a winner.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Warm cabin environment combined with easy and intuitive use of every accessory make this car stand out from the crowd. MMI, heated steering wheel, Interior lighting, keyless entry & start, navigation system, rear electric sunshade are among my favorites. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned Lexus, BMW, Volvo, Jaguar, Acura and this is my second Audi. Living in Canada with the relatively harsh winters and hot/humid summers I have found that the Quattro system in the Audi is by far the best I have ever driven for all year driving. Interior fit and finish and the intuitive design/layout make it something that I haven't had to this extent in any of the previously owned or tested cars. Each time my lease is up I go out and test each of the previously mentioned manufacturers, plus Infiniti, and go through all the pros and cons, including cost, performance, all year maintenance, and passion for the car. Service has been top notch! Great car all around.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We researched, watched and waited for just the right sedan to come to market. I compared features, performance, comfort and reliability for all sedans in the A6 category and there is no other car that would rank higher than 8.5 now or in the next years model. The steering capability with the S-Line sports suspension is what makes driving this car so much fun yet comfortable. I love the unique color (Daytona Grey) in a time when almost everything on the road is the same. The ability to power hard into your corners smoothly will never make you feel like you purchased something second rate. The MMI is fabulous and intuitive. My wife went from the A4 to this and just loves it immensely.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>You feel like you're driving an A8 without paying for one. The right amount of acceleration, size and sportiness while enjoying maximum comfort. The MMI w/ navigation, bluetooth, Bose sound is easy to use. The exterior color changes depending on the time of day. It makes my wife happy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My previous car was a Porsche Cayenne S, a 350 hp nimble beast of an SUV. It was a blast to drive. I thought I would never find a replacement. The Porsche is a distant memory now that I am driving the Audi A6 4.2. It is nice to be driving a sedan instead of an SUV. The ride is super smooth, quiet and with 350 hp this car can really take off. Audi has done a fantastic job with the fit and finish as well as integrating state of the art technology without overloading the instrument bay. The outside of the car is elegant and tasteful. The 2008 A6 4.2 comes standard with the S-Line font grille and bumpers which add a nice flare to the body.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the push button start, Bose sound system, navigation system, the bluetooth phone integration and voice commands.</FAVORITE>
