<TEXT>I Love my Edge! This is a wonderful winter vehicle for Montana. Heated leather is the best. I love the fact that it rides so smoothly and quietly even on some pretty bad roads. I haven't had any problems with it. This is a very great SUV. I looked at a lot of others but I felt the safest in this puppy. Great room for my sons car seat and stroller. Love you people from Ford. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Very practical. Lots of compliments on looks in and out. Ride is a bit stiff with the 20" whl option. Could handle a bit better if your giving up a plush ride. Plenty of go but TERRIBLE mileage for a V6. How others on here get 23+mpg is beyond me when mine doesn't even get 22mpg with cruise on at 60mph on the highway. I get 15city/20highway regularly. Car is too heavy at 4300lbs but strangely the doors are too light and slam shut too easily. Had a problem known to ford with drivers side heat not getting as hot as the passengers. heater core replaced. fixed. Others on here complain about warm A/C but strangely mine is mind numbing COLD! I have to turn it down in 95 degree weather often.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Audi-like interior in Limited with leather. AWD great in Massachusetts winter. Plenty of pickup. SYNC works well with bluetooth features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only owned my edge for a couple months. I had a Hyundai elantra and wanted a bigger vehicle since I just had a little girl. I love the room in the edge. I was looking at a few suvs and most of them still looked just as crammed as my car did once I put the car seat in. This crossover has plenty of room for the car seat and plenty of cargo space for my stroller and anything else I might need to take along with me. Also love that it has ac vents in the back so I don't have to worry about my little girl burning up. It's very comfortable even in the back seats. Gas mileage could use some improvement though. I usually get about 22-24 on the highway and about 16-18 in the city. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love driving my edge. I traded in a Jetta for it to deal with the winters and I was tired of a manual transmission. I have now found out I am an SUV woman and will probably always be one. My edge was broken into once so the pass window was smashed in but that isn't a manufacturers defect. My cruise control did stop functioning but it was replaced under warranty. As for fuel mileage - I drive to quick to give an accurate answer. I love the stability and comfort I feel while driving my Edge vs. driving a Jetta which was low to the ground and a rough ride. LOVE LOVE LOVE MY EDGE!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We had our 2008 Edge limited just 11 months before it was totaled in a very bad car wreck. My wife got T- Boned at 65 mph, and walked away from the car with no broken bones. If you saw the accident scene, you would be surprised that anyone lived. I am 100% sold on the safety of this vehicle! It had a very comfortable ride and was fun to drive. There are 2 significant problems: A/C is VERY weak (especially in TX), and we have never gotten better than 16-17 mpg (even highway trips). The window sticker said 16-24 avg mpg. What a joke that is... With that being said, we are looking at buying another one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I hit 50,000 and it seems like things are really deterioating with the Edge. I have had squeaky windows that have been repaired ($200) and now the accelerator wiring has to be replaced ($325). None of which is on warranty. I will not buy another Edge as a result and the rapirs make me wonder about Ford in general.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our Ford Edge in March 2008 after selling my car. We live in Wyoming where the winter weather can be a challange at times and we wanted something that had higher ground clearance and was AWD or 4WD. We took 2 weekends test driving every crossover vehicle on the market. We kept coming back to the Ford Edge. It is roomy, classy looking, AWD, we have 32,000 miles on it and are getting 23 MPG. I miss my little car's 30 MPG but Im not totally disappointed in my Edge's MPG wish it was getting 26-28 but 23 isn't real bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded from a 2004 Ford Freestar Limited to this, WOW! We get 24-26 MPG mostly freeway miles, which is a huge improvement. We love the fact the kids can watch the DVD with headphones while we listen to tunes. SYNC is great with the hands free it just freaks you out the first time you get a call. Living in Wisconsin this drives great in the winter weather, snow, and ice storms. The memory seat set is great. It is a spendy car but you get a ton of options. 17K miles and no problems!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car because it was cute and i wanted a small suv so i dodnt have to cram my stroller into a trunk anymore. Overall, I am pretty happy with it. I am a little disappointed because the carpet under the driver side has already pulled back and wire are showing, as well as the drivers seat underneath (my car only has 7k on it). The door rattles a little. There is no passenger handle to grab for assistance while getting in or for comfort while driving. There seems to be several blind spots. My biggest complaint is the ac. The vents only move down and you cant close them so you always have the air on you! my husband likes it cold so I am always uncomfortable when he drives</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Back to a Ford</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I said I would never buy a Ford again after many years ago having a bad experience with a Ford Dealer. After two Toyota Camrys(great car) I purchased a Ford Edge 2008 new. It has been a short time only 3 months and I am loving it. I test drove the Lexus Rx350, Nissan Murano and a few others. I agree with many others Ford has a winner. No car is perfect but if it lasts me for serveral years and runs great I will buy another one. Time will tell! I am keeping my fingers crossed! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the vista roof and I think the inside gets a bad rap. I like it and think it looks sleek. My interior is the stone leather and light grey. I got in a Honda CRV but I did not want test drive it because the inside looked so cheesy even though it is a good car. I love the 22inch wheels very showy</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I felt compelled to buy an American car due to the current economic crises. This is my first Ford & I really liked the exterior design. The car drove good & overall the interior is comfortable & roomy. After 8 months of ownership, I wish I'd bought foreign. While I have had no major issues, I feel American cars are still behind in design & quality. The AC is pathetic. The driver side does not blow. This is a bad thing in Texas. I inquired @ the dealership I have my oil changed @, the service manager told me it was a design flaw & they had tons of complaints, but there was no fixes for the issue. Not what I wanted to hear. The dashboard gauges are hard to see in low lighting conditions.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior design is very appealing. The overall size of this car is good. Not too big & not too small. The interior is a clean design & is functional.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After looking at the Subaru Tribeca, Nissan Murano and Mazda CX-7 we decided on an Edge Limited AWD. It compared very well against the competition in build quality, styling, materials and fit and finish. We belived the exterior styling to be the best of the bunch. The interior shines IMHO with a conservative, well designed layout using durable materials and easy, intuitive controls. The leather seating is nice with contrast stitching! The backseat felt the most comfortable and roomy of the 4. The sync system is outstanding, with nothing comaprable in any other vehicle we looked at; bluetooth+Cell=sweet. Little extras like puddle lamps and power rear liftgate are nice too. And the price!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well where do I start, I bought the 08 edge because of the deep discounts and thought what a great deal. I did not know that the radio would not work, the tire would blow out, and then the transmission would go out all in less than a week. I know that it is under warranty but, how would you feel about a new vehicle with this many problems in a short period of time? I lost faith in Ford.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The body style was the first thing that caught my eye before I bought a Ford Edge. The overall shape is very pleasing.The height was also a factor for me because I have trouble getting in and out of vehicles that are too low. . The interior suits my needs perfectly. I find everything is close at hand and easy to read. The seats are totally comfortable, there's plenty of head and foot room. Storage and cargo space is great too.The music system (6 CD changer, AM/FM radio and MP3 option are very adequate and easy to use. I have yet to look for an option and find that it's missing.The drive-ability is fabulous. Very smooth and easy to park and maneuver.The AWD was a life saver this winter too!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The overall outside look never fails to impress me. The leather interior is asthetically pleasing as well as luxuriously comfortable. The roomy passenger areas and flexibility of the seat functions is a definite plus. The large outside mirrors are very helpful. It's a total pleasure town and drive!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was apprehensive about buying the Edge. The first time we drove it, it was noisey and rode real rough (SEL Model) compared to the other vehicles we were shopping. After we returned a second time and drove a Limited with the 20" wheels we changed our mind. Very nice ride and quiet. Sync audio system is awesome as is the Vista Roof. Getting 20-21mpg around town. Not too bad, but better than the estimate given on the sticker. Origionally had some issues with rattles and creeks but were promptly fixed by the selling dealer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Edge for about a month now, but have been eyeing them ever since they first came out in 2007. It was between this or the Honda CRV and once I drove the Edge the contest was over. I love how much space I have in the Edge. The center console is big enough for me to put my purse in when I don't want to drag it into a store. There are cup holders everywhere. Love the way it looks sporty compared to some other CUV/SUVs. I feel very safe in this car. It's definitely bigger than my Civic but not too big to feel like I'm driving a tank. Overall, I love this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Back up sensor comes in handy when in the parking garage at work. I love the dark blue, I've gotten quite a few compliments on the color. I love the MP3 player outlet even though the sound quality could be better. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am 5'2" and have problems seeing over or around the outside mirrors. It seems as though they are too large for the vehicle. They create a horrible blind spot, which makes me very nervous while driving. I have tried raising the seat, but then it's difficult to reach the pedals and I crack my knee on the steering column when I get in and out of the vehicle. I ask my boyfriend to drive the car to get his feedback. He is 5'9" and agreed he thought they were larger than normal. He drives a F-150 truck. Prior to owning the Edge I had an Explorer and never had this problem.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Crazy for the Edge!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>After owning several foreign cars and SUV's, about 1.5 years ago I purchased a new Ford Explorer. I hated everything about the thing. I told myself over and over again I would never purchase another American-made vehicle again, I thought it was such a mistake. Then I came upon the Edge. It is unlike any Ford I have ever known. It is gorgeous inside, love the two tone! It's so fun to drive and handles so well! I feel really safe in it. I love the leather, it's not that cheap plasticy leather, and I love the stitching. Super roomy. I was really shocked at the price - very affordable. After seeing the success with the Edge, I hope Ford re-designs all of their vehicles. Thanks Ford!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We joined the "buy American" movement and purchased an Edge just after a good working over by the local Toyota dealer. Wow, I am impressed with the ease of maneuverability, the sound system, the sun roofs, and the seat's base-length- finally a seat that extends out far enough and doesn't cut off the circulation in one's legs. The second row seating is also unusually comfortable for this type car. Only had it a week, but so far, it's outstanding.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>On the edge</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>After looking at several models of CUV/SUV, including Pilot, Veracruz, CX9, Toyota Highlander, we decided that the 3rd row was the dealbreaker and went looking for something smaller. I am so glad we did. We decided on the Limited model with the Sync/Sirius/6 cd and the leather interior. I really like the two tone interior and the contrast stitching on the seats. We are just back from an 1800 mile trip and the Edge performed wonderfully. Very comfortable on the long ride and plenty of room. Gas mileage was not great, but driving 80+ MPH will do that. My first new car in 12 years and glad I'm on the Edge!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Edge after a very bad experience with a Toyota. I have had my Edge for only three weeks and have over 3,000 miles on it. I drove it from Michigan to Maine on vacation. The Edge handled flawlessly. It was very comfortable and except for a little wind noise at 45-50 mph from the outside mirrors is was like driving a luxury car. The looks, vista roof, audio system and overall driving experience still make me smile. There were no issues of quality at delivery. There are none now. I hope this is an omen of things to come. It looks great,it handles well, is very comfortable. As long as I stay around 70 on the road I get about 24.6 miles to the gallon. Good Job Ford. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is only the second Ford I have owned in 35 years. Never cared for their stylings until now. Am enjoying everything about this car except the braking distance. I live in a deer prone area and have had four accidents due to them over the years. I really need great brakes! The Edge must improve in this category. Can't believe for the level of this automobile that Ford didn't have a higher standard when it came to such an important feature. Mileage isn't too bad, but can still be improved upon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Truly designed with the driver in mind. From the amenities and comfort of the interior to the way it handles and performs on both city streets and open highways, this is one impressive vehicle! Acceleration and maneuverability beats Saturn, Chevrolet, Toyota and Honda in comparable class vehicles and at a great price. We purchased the base model SE, but all the extras like MicroSoft Sync, top of the line sound system with a 6 CD changer, radio and cruise control in the steering wheel, roof rack, anti-theft system, etc. this vehicle is in a class of its own. The ride is extremely comfortable; cruising at 70 mph feels like you're going 30 or 35 and bumps are almost unnoticeable.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We really like the MicroSoft Sync, radio and cruise controls in the steering wheel, and comfortable yet responsive feel of the suspension system. The passenger compartment is quiet, even at highway speeds, and conversation can be had at normal speaking volume. Lots of leg and hip room in all seats.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>33 mpg Highway</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I submitted a review a month after the wife and I bought a 2008 Edge, but could not wait to brag about the gas mileage we got on our 2,145 mile vacation from Iowa to North Carolina. When we left it had 2,881 miles on it. At first I did not care for the gas mileage at all, but the dealership kept telling me the mileage would get better and boy did it! I always use the cruise control, and at 74 mph this new Edge averaged 33 mpg and I have 4 people who can verify this. So eat your heart out Toyota owners. Ford has a great American crossover in this new Edge.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Being in real estate, I put a ton of miles on a car in a year, and both me and my clients love the Edge! The few snow days were absolutely no challenge, the SYNC system is amazing. Leather and other interior features are very luxurious and are extremely comfortable even for a full day in the car. Fuel economy is what I expect for a strong V6. I have never driven a car that turns heads like this! A trip up to the ski hill with two friends and skis and snowboards was a perfect use of all the space and comfort and we passed many vehicles on the way up in the snow. Passing on the highway is a breeze..the power seems even more evident at full highway speed, it can snap your head back at 120kph</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SYNC, power lift gate, navigation, sound system, leather seats with bold stitching, very comfortable back seats and of course the full glass roof! Awesome to have open on a sunny day and the wind blocker when it is open reduces highway noise to almost imperceptible. Can't decide on one favorite!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As a 5'1 woman, mine is super comfortable! My seat adjusts every which way possible! My car came with Michelins on it, smooth ride with little road noise, less than my Altima! We traded in a 2005 Nissan Altima that I had put 89,000 miles on in 38 months, trust me! The Edge is a good performing car too, has plenty of power. My gas mileage stinks, but that is my fault! Sync is great, although "Debbie" hears what she wants sometimes. Good style and design! I love it! Bought it because my sister has an 07 and loves it too! We knew all baby stuff would fit and we had outgrown my car! Husband's knees no longer hit!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync and all the power ports! Having my ipod plugged in center console! Steering wheel controls standard! Seats that feel like they are hugging me! Husband is a firefighter so saftey was major selling point! Also glad 08 has lift handle on tailgate, sister has 07 and hers is hard to open/close!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Feeling a bit let down. I see other crossovers (MDX, Acadia, Highlander) on the road and wish I had opted for one of those. The drive is nice and smooth ,and I do enjoy the Sync, nav system and power lift-gate. The airconditioning needs some help. Even on high, I keep reaching to turn it higher, and the airvents will not turn to blow directly in your face. Opening the sun-roof helps, but it is loud at higher speeds. You would think will all the hype over Sync, Ford would have invested in more speakers. 4 speakers standard and upgraded sound has only 6? Our Corolla has better sound! After 4 fillups, we are averaging 16mpg mostly city driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power liftgate, SYNC and Bluetooth.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a '05 Honda CRV, and regret trading for the Edge. Am now looking to trade back in on another CRV or something else. I have a 45 minute drive to work (one way) and am hurting by the time I get there. The seats are uncomfortable,makes my back hurt & makes my legs go to sleep and hurt. The seat needs to tilt more at the base for the shorter person. This car is not built for the short person. I can't drive through the ATM without a lot of problems or need to get out. The AC vents are pathetic. At certain angles the sun shines on the chrome strip on the shifter and surround and shines in the eyes. Would rather not have the chrome. Road noise on this one, I believe due to the brand of tires. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our Edge the day before we headed out to Orlando for vacation. The car averaged 25 mpg there and back, thought that was fantastic. Since we got back and just travel around town, the mileage has averaged between 17.5mpg and 18.5mpg. That's still pretty good to me considering it's an SUV and we both have a pretty heavy foot. The engine isn't the quickest from a dead stop but it does pretty good, however when you're up to speed it really gets up and goes when you want to pass slower drivers. My wife and I both love the car more every time we drive it. To think I was worried about buying a Ford product seems a little silly now.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power lift gate is a must have feature on this vehicle, the driving position is great, more like a truck than a car, the leather on the seats seems to be high quality,my wife loves the heated seats, I like the sync for the iPOD</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded a Toyota Forerunner for my new Edge. I thought I'd miss the Toyota but after one day the old girl was history. The Edge has a nice firm grip on the road and is quick enough to get you into traffic without any anxiety. The ride is quiet and I have too many choices for music with the Sync system. All in all, I love the car. I love the automatic lift on the rear door and the roominess for all the passengers. So far the gas mileage has been in the 17-23 mpg range. All in all a great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After looking at Saturn, Mazda, Cadilac, Buick, and Ford Crossovers, the Edge was and pleasant and impressive surprise. A great riding and handling vehicle with a well- engineer interior space to seat its riders. My wife was immediately drawn to the luxurious look and feel of the stone colored leather and the pearlescet white sand mica paint. The 20" tires with their chrome clad wheels gives the Edge a final touch of sophistication and well-connectedness. Engine is quiet and responsive with all the power you need. No jerkiness, no hesitation, and one of the smoothest transmissions we've ever experienced. Beats our Lexus RX330 all over the place. The panoramic moonroof-a real wowzer! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync Power lift back doo.r Back up sensors. Comfy leather seating. Soothing feel of luxury without breaking the bank. So impressed we're going to get a second one for me. A little sportier with roof rails, red paint and camel leather. Now that's what I'm talking about!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've driven my Edge for almost 1,400 miles and, love it. Traded in my '05 Murano. The ride, performance and, comfort are better. The Vista roof and, Sync are fantastic. Gas mileage is okay, was getting around 17 per gallon with mostly local driving. Added a Cyclone fuel saver & added 1.5 MPG's. What you get for the price is great, got everything but Nav. My only complaint, non Nav. radio display is very lacking in info and, impossible to see in sunlight and, the auto climate control gives you no idea of what the system is doing while in auto mode. Again, still love the Edge and, would recomend to anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had owned a 97 Ford Explorer for 8 years and put 250,000 miles on it. I have been looking for a good quality, highly reliable, comfortable SUV and all roads and research led me to purchase an 08 Ford Edge. I had been researching for 6 months, looking at Chevy, Honda, Lincoln, Toyota Highlander, and GMC Acaidia. I decided on the Edge because it met all the requirements of what I wanted in my next vehicle. I average 25 - 30,000 miles a year, so relibility, comfort, interior room and gas mileage were all important factors. I have driven it 4,400 miles now and have been averaging 19.9 miles/gallon overall. Congrats to Ford! I would highly recommend the Edge to anyone looking for a new SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fell in love with the exterior styling while following a Ford Edge. The interior is very comfortable. The seats feel like they are constantly hugging you and the placement of the controls are spot on. I bought my Egde right after the test drive. A nice quiet ride. Wind noise is a thing of my past. I did a MPG test at 65mph I got 22.3mpg at 60 I got 25.3mpg and at 55mph I got 27.3mpg. I know 55 feels slow but its a 25% savings and I don't have to worry about passing anyone. Plus who wants to get to work in a hurry. It has plenty of get up and go when you need it and its very agile but stable. I dont miss my 13mpg avg F150 super crew Lariat one bit.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm sorry I crossed over from a Mountaineer. The Edge can't compare and suffers from numerous areas of poor engineering. Fuel injectors and exhaust make great deal of noise. Can't drive with windows open above 30 MPH. Extreme wind noise from vista roof diffuser. Constantly hunting for lower gears at highway speed an hangs on upshift. Breaking and gas mileage are both poor. Water builds up under tail light lenses and fills the area behind the high break light. Could also benefit by having some tie downs in cargo area. AC vents don't direct air high enough to clear heat from the ceiling. Suggest you test drive at highway speeds before purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I traded a 2006 Toyota Camry XLE for a 2008 Ford Edge Limited. We were afraid to commit to American, because their track record was not the greatest. We decided to check out the Ford Edge since we were in the market for a new CUV. We looked at all the competition, and we decided to buy the Edge. We have to take our hats off to Ford. We believe Ford finally has a winner with this Edge. This car is absolutely amazing! Excellent feature set, great design, fantastic build quality, what more can you ask for. Compared to the competition, we believe they truly have an "edge." I'm happy to support the American economy, now that Ford has a solid product.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a truck guy who has no ATV or any other reason for a box anymore. I do still have a 18' bass boat, that I would not be able to get to the lake with out something with enough power. The Edge has plenty of that! The quality of this car is tight. It makes my wife's 06 Toyota Sienna seem like an old rattle trap. Gas mileage is the reason for the purchase, and I'm pleased. Sticker said 17 city and 22 on the hwy. I avg a liitle over 20, and have already got as much as 24.4 at about 73 mph on the interstate. Like everyone says? it may get better.

<TEXT>My husband and I bought the Edge after my '98 Ford Explorer. We needed a larger car, for we have long trips planned for this summer, but we had to consider the kids. They needed room! We got all options but instead of the vista roof, we ended up getting the entertainment system (dvd player). We love the roominess and space. The look seems sleek and nicer than other vehicles, a plus. We compared it to the Escape, and chose the Edge. The Escape rode higher and was thinner while the Edge rode lower and is wider, therefore the Edge had more room. Overall we are in love.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently traded my gas powered F-250 in for my new Edge. I'm gonna say this is a cool ride. When total strangers come up to you, and often I might add, and ask if you like it...well that says a lot. Of course I tell them that I love it, then proceed to show them all the cool features. Then when they sit in it, you aught to see the smile on there faces. I love it. For me this is a really nice cuv. It's put together well, rides smooth, it catches the eye with it's 20" wheels, and with the DVD player, satellite radio, and Bluetooth capabilities long trips are fun again! I think any one looking for a new cuv should give the Ford Edge a look.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded a 05 Freestyle for the 08 Edge. I test drove 09 Murano, Mazda CX-7, Acura RDX. Decided for the Edge because of the lower lease payments (+ X-plan), vista roof, and some other features. Exterior design also a plus. However I have to admit the 09 Murano drives much better and has a better finishing, unfortunately too expensive and premium fuel. The Edge engine and 6 speed auto-trans. is a huge leap from my old engine with the CVT. I read some reviews saying not refined, slow, etc.. for the Edge/MKX. Maybe not the best ever but I am very happy and suprised with its performance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely loved driving my big Ford Expedition, but because of gas prices and $100 fill-ups, my husband & I decided to buy something smaller. I was very worried about feeling comfortable in a "smaller" vehicle b/c I'm 5'10" and having enough leg & head room was a big problem in most of the vehicles that I test-drove. The Edge is a great CUV. It has a lot of pep and it handles really well. In the Edge feel like I have more leg room in the backseat that I did in my Expedition. We took it on our first road trip and we were able to fit luggage for 4 people and still had room to spare. I can't say enough good things about the SYNC system...LOVE IT</TEXT>

My first choice of cars was the Toyota Highlander and what a nice car it is. It handled well and has good power but the dealer wasn't in the mood to drop his price too much so I tried a Honda Pilot. Another nice car but it seemed a bit boring and under powered. Car three was the Buick crossover. Another nice car but it just didn't move the soul. When I drove the Edge my mind was made up pretty quickly. It looks great, has good power with a nice but not fancy interior. The rear seats are spacious and the ability to lay back was a selling point for my friends</TEXT>

<TEXT>Tested every '08 CUV on the market and bought the Edge. Great 2nd row leg room with easy-to-use recline feature, as well as comfortable seating both front and back. Ridiculously fun to drive, handles well and gives driver an intuitive feel when behind the wheel. Modern styling with a good-looking, rugged-stance. Sync, navigation and Vista Roof options take an already well-designed vehicle to the next level of driver integration. Progressive, comfortable, responsive, solid and tight, the Edge is well priced in its class. A must to compare if you're in the CUV market. The more I drive it, the happier I am to own it. This vehicle grows on you with each passing day. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Top IIHS safety pick, Vista roof brings the outside in, Audophile sound with Sync, Sirius and navigation makes for an amazing package.

<TEXT>It is above and beyond my expectations not to be a true luxury vehicle. I like the visibilty it allows with it's height. It drives like a sports car but rides like a luxury car. It has a hint of sportiness to it that keeps it from looking like a "grocery getter". </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A blast to drive. Looks are outstanding. fit and finsh awesome. Love the telescoping steering wheel, dual climate controls, SYNC, power fold down back seats, heated seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned mainly imports and was hesitant. I was leaning towards the Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander and stopped at Ford dealer at whims notice. The test drive sold me and I bought it that day. First thing I noticed is the styling is beautiful and not overly generic & boring as the Pilot and Highlander. The interior was the same and exuded the same luxury as the RX330 I previously owned. The acceleration was amazing and ride felt confident and supple. There is something about this car that I love over every car I have owned. Hard to explain...it has soul and does not feel like an appliance. I get compliments everywhere I go. I see more and more of them in Atlanta.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SYNC entertainment system, 2nd row fold flat seat w/ a button that utomatically releases them, voice activated navigation system, V6 engine...lots of power, 20" wheels look great, center console storage, comfortable seats, interior lighting (gauges), overall layout of interior</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My daughter talked me into looking at this car/suv and I love driving it. It is so quiet, no road noise, rides smooth, beautiful interior, love the hands free phone system, navigation system (still have to learn this). Like the tailgate automatic lift & closure, automatic seats that lay down in the back.If you haven't looked at this vehicle you are missing something special. Oh don't miss the full moon/sun roof it's really different.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hands free phone, navigation system, rear tailgate auto lift, comfortable seats, wonderful radio/cd player system. Just can't say enough about this car/suv.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in a 2006 Hyundai Tuscon. This Edge is sweet in the pearl white color. Drives beautiful. The ride and handling is superior to even my 2007 MKZ Lincoln with all wheel drive. Read the brakes arent that good but I find they are fine. Good feel and braking so far. Only have 60 miles on the truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride and power along with agile handling</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I travel on business and have driven just about everything domestic and import. But, there's something about this car that you can't quite put your finger on. Their engineers thought- through the details to make it fun, carry a lot of stuff, and get a lot of compliments at the gas station. You can't believe how much fun it is to drive. You honestly have to restrain yourself. It has 13000 miles now and except for the new car smell being gone, it feels/sounds and drives as perfect as the day I bought it - better than the Toyota I traded in. My Toyo was good - but, this is unbelievable. And, my wife is happy. She laughs that this is what is born when a Mustang marrys an Explorer</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort inside and handling. It was hard settling on a color. Every color looks great on this Edge. Like the Sirius radio and plug in for MP3 player. The "Synch" feature wasn't yet available, but hopefully next time. It suits our athletic, active Colorado lifestyle. There's not much not to like</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Took delivery of my '08 Edge AWD Limited on 10 Nov 2007, (approx. three weeks after placing an order for it with the dealership), and have really been enjoying the ride since. Loaded with just about every option, including many of the Ford accessories. Good looks (in Redfire Metallic & 20" chromed wheels), good features (SYNC, NAV, SIRIUS), and a good time driving it around. Just spun past 750 miles on the odometer so just getting started, but it's everything I expected so far (& more). A real "head turner" here in my town!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is just too cool! I really like the exterior design. I chose the cloth interior. It's not as soft or nice as it could be but, it looks durable and they are comfortable. I would recommend the interior/exterior insurance package if you get the cloth seats. I'm loving the SYNC! It was easy to program and it downloaded phonebook from my cell in less than a minute. It was easy to plug my Ipod in and it charges. The Sirius satellite is nice but, I don't really need it. The sound system is great! The space is great. The driver's side window is auto up and down. Parking is too easy with the Reverse Sensing System. I love this crossover!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SYNC! Sound system, auto driver's side window, MP3 charging capabilities, USB port, double pipes, the exterior look</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is great. Pleasantly surprised after reading middling reviews from Consumer Reports and other car rags. The 3.5 engine is strong and economical, vista roof is a delight and the Sync system sold the deal. Sync is easy to use and set up and has USB to connect ipod for charging and full integration. Voice commands actually work. Heard about poor braking but have not found this is an issue, in everyday driving it goes and stops effortlessly. Getting about 25 mpg highway and 19 in town.</TEXT>
