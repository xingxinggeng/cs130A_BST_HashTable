<TEXT>I love this car. It drives smooth, is amazing on ice and snow and is just as nice to look at as the Acura everyone else seems to own here in Alaska. I was surprised at how quick it accelerates and it purrs at 70 to 75 mph. The Bluetooth is a feature that I will never live without. For the $ I paid ($24K) I feel like I got the best car for the money. I smile every time I drive it. Dealership support also has been fantastic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When the family grew it was time to get into the SUV market...never thought I would have purchased a Hyundai...but glad I did!! I was always a loyal Honda diver..but the Pilot did not compare to the Veracruz (price/warranty/amenities. So far smooth diving and no complaints other than gas mileage could be better but since this is my 1st suv, I expected this to change. I enjoy all the luxury items at a great price that was better than the CX-9, Highlander, and Pilot. I would highly recommend this vehicle. I like having a nice quiet comfortable ride on long trips and this car pampers you, and yes as it has been compared to the Lexus 350 it is much less expensive and still has that luxury feel!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a Tucson for the Veracruz. Have been happy with the size and 3rd row seats. A bit disappointed however by the power train. It's a dog to get moving from a stop which can be a problem in sticky situations. Transmission also gets confused as to when to shift and the engine can easily overpower the tranny before it shifts, better to do the manual shift. Fuel economy is not bad but could be a bit better. Have had a few qc issues. Car was sold with a bad tire and or rim, the rear quarter fills with water from the rear ac unit and both under mirror lights have popped out ..</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like this car. I have about 12,000 on it. Have been back to dealer twice for service and one complaint that has not been fixed. It is the excessive suspension noise on uneven pavement. It sounds like car is falling apart. Dealer said I had 50 lb. Of air in tires. Second time back I was told nothing is wrong, but that I had to get used to " driving a truck". Consumer magazine talked about this problem, but nobody else.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Good Value</AUTHOR>
<TEXT> I bought my 2008 Veracruz in March of 2009, and it was sold at invoice, and with a $6000 rebate in addition, so it came it a little over $20,000 for a nicely equipped crossover vehicle. An SUV is built on a truck chassis, so I would consider this a crossover. Nice design and build quality, and a nice vehicle to drive. The only negatives are the poor fuel economy (l5 mpg. city), and the very poor reception of the AM radio, which has a poor tuner. The satellite and FM radio reception is fine, but I like to listen to AM. I listened to another Veracruz and it had the same poor tuner. Nice room for seven here, and a very good value for the money. Just be ready to buy anot</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the 2008 base model. I am very impressed by how good the car is, both in performance, comfort and design. It is very competitive with the 2005 Honda Pilot I also have. In exterior design and ride it is even better. My only peeve is the audio quality, which lacks resolution and "life" compared to may other OEM systems.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first new car (in 1986) was a Hyundai Excel. Perfect price for the newly graduated and employed. People made fun of "Hyundai" back then. Seems the rep has changed and I'm loving my new Hyundai Veracruz. Ride is so smooth and it feels like a luxury vehicle. Lots of nice interior touches and great handling and maneuvering. While competing dealers will tell you the Veracruz is not "in the same class" as their crossover, it's priced right and I'm listening to the reports from the experts that Hyundai is making a quality vehicle. Time will tell, but love it so far.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable and plush interior, great sound from the soundsystem, smooth and quiet ride, 3rd row seat is truly additional seating & not some cheap drop down, rides like a car not a truck, trip meters and info on how much gas left etc., outside temp reading, roomy, my teens love it too!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have the limited and it is the best suv I had ever owned. I had an 2007 honda pilot and the veracruz wins by far. it is so quite on the road its hard to believe your moving, and the ride is the best, very smooth. This is my fourth Hyundai and they just get better, I had two Santa fe,s 01 & 03 and both were great. My wife has an 04 XG350L and had no problems. Hope this helps anyone looking at Hyundai.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After over 1yr I have 14K on my '08 Veracruz Limited. The vehicle has been nearly flawless! Nothing has gone wrong - not even minor problems. The interior still looks new even with kids. The interior layout is completely intuitive and the best I have had on any vehicle. A minor complaint is acceleration from a stop. But, to my surprise, using premium fuel does improve this problem a bit. The interior space is exceptional. We cart 2 kids with child seats and gear and the VC has ample room. Ride comfort for long trips is great. My wife's vehicle is an '08 Lexus RX350 and I can say the 2 are fairly comparable. We usually take the VC for trips because it has more storage space and a 3rd row.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second review of Veracruz. With 1500 miles on it I'm enjoying the vehicle more and more. Prior to car purchase, i'd thought "Well, this is not Pilot or Highlander or CX-9, but it costs about 6 grand less". What i realize now Veracruz is actually at least AS GOOD as any competition, has a superior warranty AND it will leave a bunch of green in your wallet. It doesn't have a big name yet, but a brand name is probably not worth this much money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Fantastic vehicle for the money. We bought the Limited and love it. Best features are the proximity key and auto open/close lift gate. The navigation system is so so but the stereo system rocks. Great head room and very comfortable for long trips. Very quiet ride with very little road noise. We test drove several other SUV makes and found them overpriced for the same features and less warranty. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my first non-Toyota/Honda vehicle and I was pleasantly surprised that my Hyundai Veracruz is such a great vehicle. I have had it for 8 months now and I am very satisfied with it. The ride quality is excellent and very smooth. Handles like a car on curves. In normal commute I get about 20 mpg on average, although I have even got up to 25 mpg on the I-5 from sf to la. The interior design is very thoughtful and practical. Very comfortable seating. No mechanical problems so far after 10k of driving. I paid about $4000 less than what I would have paid for a comparable Toyota highlander.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hyundai Veracruz Limited Edition is the best SUV on the market!(personal Opinion) After buying a 2008 Chrysler Pacifica, which turned out to be a Lemon,(Buy Back) I had my mind set on the Mazda CX9. My husband kept telling me to look at the Veracruz before buying the Mazda CX9, and I am soo happy I did! This vehicle is nice and is loaded with the best stuff! Compare interior and exterior...but by far, Hyundai Veracruz has better Warranty and the dealership was 100% better on satisfying customers! Like everyone is saying...try it! You will be glad you did! No regrets here! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Hyundai and I'm very happy with the vehicle so far. Had thoroughly reviewed and test-driven several crossovers, including the Highlander, CX-9, Veracruz and Pilot. Overall, Veracruz offered the most options, the best warranty, and the highest bottom line value. I'm getting about 16/23 MPG city/highway, which is not bad at all given the vehicle size. If you're in the market for a comfortable mid-size crossover at bargain price, you have to test-drive the Veracruz. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I shopped for her new SUV for six weeks. We thought we had settled on a new Highlander until a friend told us about their experience with Hyundai. We stopped at the hyundai dealer at 6pm and left at 8:30 in her new Veracruz! What a great vehicle! It looks great has every option under the sun and drives smoothly and quietly. The first thing I noticed was the fit and finish (both inside and out). The next thing that caught my eye was the incredible amount of standard options. The salesman then told me about the unbeatable warranty and we both felt like we had found our new car (and we hadn't even driven it yet!). Bottom line - great experience, great vehicle, great price! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fit and Finish, automatic rear door, smart key, moon roof and navigation that allows input while moving. Leather feels like very good quality and the protection plan for interior and exterior is a great value. Added the chrome wheels - they make the Veracruz look as good a Lexus! Price! Warranty!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bravo Hyundai! Nothing beats haggling with car dealers, I spent 3 weeks pulling my dealers leg, and finally settled on a 2008 GLS with the Premium package for $21,000, tax, registration and doc fees were extra. What a steal! Car is wonderfully built with a 6 cylinder engine, roomy, and 3 rows of seating! Big 17" wheels, wood wrapped dash and doors, sunroof, heated seats! At nighttime there is a mood light and cup holders and ashtray lights too! No doubt this car is the envy of all crossovers! Car handles wonderfully. Responsive steering. Never thought I would buy non-American, but I'm glad I did. Test drive one, you won't be disappointed! </TEXT>

<TEXT>So, I reported in Nov-08 that I loved my Veracruz...well, that was before driving it in one of the worst snow storms we've had here in Seattle. This car is amazing in the snow! Mine is only a regular front wheel drive but the electronic stability control and traction control, along with the all weather 18" tires and shiftronic option allowed me to get around in 12" of snow while others were stuck. I was extremely pleased with the way this car managed very icy slick roads. I continue to love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have been looking for a second SUV that will accommodate our growing family and we've found it in the Vera Cruz. We comparatively drove the Dodge Journey and the Toyota Highlander and the Vera Cruz won out by far. We even parked beside a similar colored silver Lexus and it was obvious the styling was much nicer on the Vera Cruz. We also own a Santa Fe and although we love it as well, the Vera Cruz provides that added extra room when you need it. The 3rd row is enough for adults (issues with the Highlander and Journey) and even with a car seat in the second row you can comfortably fit in another 2 adults beside it (a tight squeeze in our Santa Fe). I would recommend to any family!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Adult friendly eating in the 2nd and 3rd rows; Lighting for the dash; Dual climate control zones for heat/cool; Fast acting heated front seats; Large cargo space in the back (and even alot with the 3rd row set-up); The quality of the leather interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just recently bought the Veracruz and last week just to break it in my wife and I drove to Tampa from N.Y to start off the fuel economy was better than expected it cost about 75.00 each way that was driving at or about 70-80 mph the comfort was great although would have liked just a little more leg room I'm 6-3 but by far more room than the lexus.I bought the base gls fwd model a left over 2008 It has excellent road handling perfect interior and 7 passenger seating and has alot of bells and whistles for the base model lots of storage space as well as oooohh and the price about 20,000 less than the lexus which I looked at first but to be honest this drives better </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased Veracruz LTD AWD in February 2009. The vehicle handles exceptionally smooth, is well equipped with many standard features and is a complete joy to drive. The sound system is decent and came equipped with the DVD package. A surprising feature NOT included is a jack for an Ipod. Gas mileage hovers around 20 mpg. Not great but comparable to other vehicles in it's class. I would recommend Hyundai as a vehicle brand for people to seriously consider. With the amount of rebates on this particular vehicle, the strength of it's warranty and the assurance plan in place, you cannot go wrong.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only put 800 plus miles on the car but have to say it has been all and more than I expected. Quite ride loaded with extras good power but a little disapointed in the gas mileage. Only getting about 14 MPG all in town though. Over all best vehicle I have ever owned. This is my 2nd Hyundai and can't say enough about them. $4000 rebate and 1500 owner loyalty when I walked in the door was a big plus also.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Far and away the Smart Key. Open start and lock the car without ever removing the "key" from your pocket. Great feature! 3rd row seating is actually useable and adults can sit there in a pinch. Also like the built in garage door opener in the rear view mirror.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This rating system was very helpful to me when I was deciding what vehicle to purchase. I would like to return the favor. This is my first Hyundai purchase. I replaced my wife's 02 Camry. The Camry was very good to us. I wanted to avoid a bad purchase decision. I test drove the Highlander, CX-7, CR-V, Rav-4, Accord, Camry, Santa Fe, Murano, Venza. We Can't afford a Lexus or one of the higher end SUV's. The Veracruz for us was the best all a round vehicle. With the economy the way it is I was able to get 8K off the sticker. Very few vehicles offered a dark interior. I'm keeping my fingers crossed, but I wouldn't hesitate suggesting a Veracruz to anyone. Nice solid affordable SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Started out at the 2008 CAS and compared all 7 passenger cars. Narrowed it down to Saturn Outlook and the Veracruz, Saturn lost. So far 9800 miles and not a single problem other than two broken seat belt clips from a clumsy kid. Handles snow great, even through 2' drifts. I have nothing bad to say about it, only thing that is annoying is the XM radio switches back to preview channel when you switch to AM/FM. MPG on highway tops 25 MPG, but winter has it down to 17.3 overall. Summer 19 MPG. It's my favorite car. My daily driver is a Toyota Camry Hybrid, so I get to have fun once in a while and drive this instead. </TEXT>

You can't buy a HONDA CRV for this amount with a 4 cylinder. Only one problem so far, the seat memory switch had to be changed. Dealer is great to work with. The Infinity stereo is OK not great, but overall still very pleased with the quality of the vehicle. Third row seating is great. Gas mileage so far is about 18 MPG (city driving) not to bad considering. Love the safety features. Honda, Lexus/Toyota can learn something from Hyundai. The are overpriced and over rated.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased a 2008 Hyundai Veracruz Limited FWD and drove from Texas to Kansas. This vehicle is very nice, and comes equipped better than a Lexus RX350. It also has a better warranty than the Lexus. The third row seat fold flat and is big enough for two adults. I was going to buy the Nissan Murano but the third row plus a better deal than an equivalently equipped Murano helped me choose the Veracruz. The exterior and interior fit and finish is very nice with tight tolerances. It's quiet at highway speeds, six speed automatic transmission with manual mode, and loaded with just about every convenience you could want. Power liftgate, leather heated seats, heated side mirrors, sunroof, etc</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my Santa Fe for this because Hyundai gave me the highest trade in value. The exterior was so so. The interior was great. Soft touch material. Good looking leather. It drove quiet. Infinity radio is not that impressive but ok. However, within a month, the leather starts to fade. It starts to pick up road noise. Some rattle starts to show up here and there. Most serious problem was the transmission. I heard a lot of good things about the Aisian transmission. However, my transmission has problem shifting from 3rd to 4th gear, rumbling a lot. It went back to the dealership. They told me that there was nothing wrong. They also broke their promise about loaner car. Regret</TEXT>

<TEXT>We love this car. We debated a lot on which crossover to purchase, and finally decided that the VC was the best deal. We couldn't get any other car with all the features we wanted for this price. The dealership even added the Parrot bluetooth system, which is really convenient. Fuel economy is probably its greatest weakness, averaging about 20mpg, but still is comparable to its competitors. Other cool features, the rear view mirrors tilt down when you're in reverse so you can see how close you are to the curb (can turn this feature off as well). Seats are pretty comfy, even the third row where we've had a few adult passengers have a comfortable ride. We love the power liftgate. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Today completes my first year of ownership. After nearly 16,000 miles I like it more every day. First thing I added was a trailer hitch. I towed my boat over the Cascade Mountains this past June with no issues and regular lowland towing is a breeze. Plenty of power, torque, and the suspension is satisfactory for towing. This vehicle is stout but still drives like a car. The ride is smooth and quiet and the handling is too. I recently did some dirt road driving on logging roads in Oregon and I hardly noticed the lack of pavement. It handles seven normal sized adult passengers comfortably or just me and all my gear with room to spare.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched this vehicle before buying and found that all but one were great ratings. The one bad stated that he had electrical problems from the very beginning. Well, I am the second. After only 10 months, the alarm would trigger when ever I unlocked and opened the door. They replaced a circuit card. Then, the steering wheel would not tilt. They replaced the switch twice and then the steering column. Then it would not tilt nor telescope so they replaced a circuit card. Three weeks later, it's doing it again. The DVD volume is much louder than the radio and they can't fix it. The fan under the hood is very loud sometimes. I am getting lots of rattles and wind noise now. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I wrote a review in October 2007 after owning the Veracruz for 2 weeks. After having owned for a year now I am pleased to report that I am as happy with the Veracruz today as then. Not a single thing has needed to be fixed. Everything has worked perfectly from Day 1 and continues to be a joy to drive...city and highway. My wife is even more pleased with the Veracruz as she drives it more than I do. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We love our new Veracruz!! We've done a lot of research on crossover vehicles, and test drove several cars before deciding on the VC. It's super comfortable and has so many extras that the competitors charge much more for. This is a great vehicle for the money!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hyundai did a great job in designing this vehicle. We really like the blue tooth, built-in XM radio, dual climate control, seat comfort, power lift back gate and keyless entry! The number one thing we like is it is fun to drive!</FAVORITE>

The power lift gate is the bomb having kids and the third row seats come in handy when carrying the neighbors kids along. Great job Hyundai - keep up the great work!

<TEXT>We purchased our new Veracruz limited in July and traded in our 02 expedition eb. I really didn't think I would be happy with a smaller vehicle after driving an expedition for almost 7 years, but guess what, I am. This vehicle has more technolgy than I know what to do with. When I pass a Lexus, I don't see any difference. Maybe a lot less, but they look alike. Considering all the cuv's out there to choose from, I think this Hyundai is one of the best. It's a lot of car for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded an Infiniti FX for this car. As a result, I use that as a basis to compare. 'Cruz has all the luxury features, is quieter, built a little better (so far), has a better ride, and the audio with the the DVD package is the best I have ever heard from a factory. Fuel economy is about the same (disappointing since it is FWD with a six speed, weighs about the same and is a bit slower.) At least it likes regular. Handling is the only negative, but the FX is a unfair comparison. Compared to Highlanders and Pilots, it is fine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Nevermind the MotorTrend review where it beats the Lexus, or the various quality awards from JD Power, etc. This car is sleek and unbelievably refined and classy inside, and in the GLS FWD trim, an insane bargain at under 25k. The various traction and brake and ESC controls, 5 stars for safety and the tons of airbags make me feel its a great choice for our family. The driving is still sort of truck like, with acceleration and body roll pretty average, and the cabin's not as quiet as the reviews say it is, but overall still very impressive. Haven't had it long enough to have firsthand experience with its reliability, but I'm surprised at the lack of initial issues - none at all. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy. Cloth is very premium. Wood trim and textured soft rubber molding adds a luxurious feel. Tons of cubbyholes with the slow-opening lids. 17in Kumho oem tires much better than you'd think. Reviews and awards give so much confidence to the brand. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We are on our 7th Hyundai and wanted to share our thoughts about. What ever Hyundai products they come out with it will be well built, highly engineered, extremely good quality, and currently own a 2007 vere-cruz with the ultimate package, and a 2007 sonata limited, not only are they beautiful they are very reliable vehicles, and I get 25 mph with our Vera-cruz two wheel drive, and get 28 mph with our v6 sonata. We are very proud of our Hyundai's and will be buying the new Genesis sedan next summer, unless they put the v8 in the Vera-cruz. Now that would be something. I surely hope Hyundai at least make this an option. Some people critize a car no matter what. Hyundai rules in our house. Bernard Edwards.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Drove the Pilot, Highlander, RAV, Arcadia, Outlook, and Santa Fe. I am a Toyotal fan, but the Highlander was a bit wide like a minivan and the RAV was a bit small. Test drove the Santa Fe a second time - nice but small for my needs. Finally, test drove the Veracruz. It was excellent - smooth transmission, quiet ride, instant feeling of luxury. This SUV is big, but comfortable. My kids love the third row. Drives smoother than my Sienna (which is excellent). I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far this has been a great vehicle. We replaced a 2002 Toyota Highlander with the Veracruz. The Hyundai is quieter, gets better gas mileage, and has more room. My wife liked the style better than the new Highlander. After 5000 miles, we have had no problems at all. The quality of the sound system is as good as the JBL we had in the Toyota. The quality of the paint and interior materials is better than I expected from Hyundai. So far, neither show any wear at all. The ride quality is very good for a crossover vehicle and the road and wind noise is almost nonexistent. I would not hesitate to recommend this vehicle to a friend. The third seat is actually usable too. That's a plus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased my 2008 Veracruz SE (with Power & Leather Package) about two weeks ago and LOVE IT! Bought the Titanium Blue with Gray leather interior. VERY NICE! My wife and I are extremely pleased with our new Veracruz. We love the heated seats, XM radio, power sunroof, power liftgate & backup sensors. I am impressed on how smooth the vehicle rides and there is no outside wind noise. The Veracruz is FUN to drive and has alot of "get up and go" under the hood. I am averaging about 19 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway. The ShiftTronic transmission feature is very nice and comes in handy when driving on step upgrades. A little disappointed that the SE model doesn't have memory seats</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the VeraCruz (instead of a Lexus) because of all the great revues that I had read and because of all of the nice features for the price. However, I've had a terrible time with squeaks and rattles. (Headliner and the overhead vents, door pillars, doors, back seats, etc) The dealer told me that the noises are normal because of all the plastic parts and there was nothing that they could do. In other words, they didn't want to spend a lot of time on it. I don't know if this is just poor engineering or poor build quality, but this is unacceptable in a $35K vehicle. Make sure that the radio has a lot of volume, you'll need it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I like the comfy seats and they are easy to adjust. There's plenty of room all around. The layout is good and the build quality and materials on par with the Ford Edge and Saturn Outlook. Good A/C. The ride is fairly smooth and its quiet inside. We were surprised to see the gas go so fast especially in the city when it returned only 13-14 miles per gallon average. Not very good. We are not impressed with the reliability or warranty coverage either. The dealers are all unethical. They charged us for things we never needed when we brought it in for warranty items; the trans would not shift out of park and was flat bedded, dealer charged us $850 for brake pads! Poor resale! </TEXT>

It is smooth, quite, luxurous, well designed, high quality, etc. The engine and transmission are wonderful. The gas mileage is great for a mid-size SUV - I get 23 mpg with highway driving.

<TEXT>Finally Hyundai has a SUV that matches the top class in the marketplace at a price at least 25% lower for the same quality and options. Nice features, Well written operating manuals, warranty (a good package actually). Carries 7 adult passengers comfortably on any seat. Try that on "comparables" such as Pacifica, Commander, etc. Can easily carry 8 if 3rd row passengers are of normal size. Nice compartments for glasses, etc. Good quality materials used on interior decor. 6 gears forward help on economy. a happy customer albeit had it for only 3 weeks so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We looked at multiple vehicles - eg Mazda CX9, Ford Fusion. Overall this was the best buy by several thousand dollars given the specs. The model we chose was the AWD limited. There were few options as it already had most of them. The ride is comfortable and quiet although not exciting. Audio excellent. Fuel economy is not as good as advertised but is it ever? The exterior is stylish but the colour choices are limited. Most suprising was the internal colours which on this vehicle (Ltd) was limted to a saddle brown leather despite the dash etc being grey. Seats are comfortable,easy to move to allow exit and loading. Overall I am pleased. We have to wait for command start. Recomended.</TEXT>
