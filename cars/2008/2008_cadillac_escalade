<TEXT>I also own a 2007 Range Rover HSE with luxury package, and it's a great truck, but Escalade platinum is unbelievable. Everything is covered in soft great smelling leather, including dash and doors and entire seats. Power is spot on and most of all ride has better control and smoothness than regular Escalade and Range Rover because of magna ride. Same suspension as Ferrari 599 and Chevy Corvette ZR1 and new Caddy CTS-V . Must drive on highway. It's an absolute dream. Let's buy American again, because GM is finaly making a perfect car and America's future is in our hands to keep American companies alive for a better future. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather, ride, navigation, white diamond color, and most of all power and ride with 100% quality.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Not sure where to begin, this is my 2nd slade and the best. GM does need to give this monster motor multi-displacement and possibly engine off at idle, but appreciate its ability to run on mid grade nicely and regular in a pinch with no problems. 3rd seat layout is a joke and it went in my mini storage the 2nd day. Exhaust note at idle and low rpm is absolutely beautiful! And at freeway speeds muffler tech. makes the hearty growl disappear (Huh, how'd they do that ?) I've got 6600 miles on this brute and oil life is still projected at 38% left. Pretty cool with factory oil, and it hasn't used a drop.So much more to praise; ride/sound/build/comfort/Power/etc qualities. Platinum model next</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, engine, engine !! Sweetest one yet (sans ZR1 motor) Interior , ergonomics, 22's from the factory, exhaust note, great looks, and mostly; Reliability Plus !</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This may be the nicest looking large SUV, however the trade off for reliability, build quality/materials, and lack of basic amenities leave this owner regretting every drive. I only have 7 thousand miles and the things spends more time at the dealer than my garage. GM clearly rushed this vehicle to market before it was done. The interior materials are cheap and not color matched. The metal is different colors and burns your hands. My door panels are turning purple from black. Only 2 windows auto down. the third seat is a pain to store. The onstar drops calls in the city, god forbid I need it out of town. Buy something else!</TEXT>

<TEXT>It is nice to drive and looks sharp. That is about it. Engineers must have been high when the interior was planned. The rear pass. windows don't roll down all the way. Was told GM makes these doors to small around the wheel well hence window rolls down 1/2 way - no it's not a safety thing. There are no pockets in the back side doors. No Storage. All of the seats are SO uncomfortable. They are like sitting on concrete. The third row seats have no place to put anything. For the third row both cup holders are on the left side of the car. There is a water leak in sun roof. Too many problems to list. No wonder GM is having financial problems. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Smooth as silk if driven on glass. On slightly rough road, it hops a lot. Terrible visibility. Inconvenient entry/exit of rear passengers. Loose fitting panels. doors fill with water when washed. Transmission shifting erratic, and unpredictable (dangerous when towing). Cheep chrome on wheels and roof racks. Too noisy for a Cadillac. Rear suspension leveling is week. Flaws too many to list. Were Cadillac's engineers drunk or just plane incompetent?? </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned 3 range rovers from 2005 up until 2008. I should have kept my range Rover. It's like going from a Porsche to a scooter. This car has no detail and terrible quality. The stitching is poorly done and everything looks like plastic. (wait! Is is all plastic, even the fake wood trim) from a side rear view the escalade looks ugly. The escalade idles very roughly. What do you expect from a gm I guess? Car was probably built in 15 mins. From robots. Good thing I lease this pile of junk cause range Rover is waiting for me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this great suv from the dealership in Dec. 2007, it was the manager's furnished auto. I traded in my 2004 Pearl White Escalade for this 08 Black beauty. I have all the bells on it as I did on the 2004! You cannot find a more comfortable car as the Escalade. I get 14 mpg average with the 08 and did the same with the 04. I will always drive an Escalade.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I loved the look of the new Escalade and alas that is all the car is. Just something good to look at. But it is a mechanical nightmare. This truck looks, drives and feels like it was put together in a hurry. I only have 2500 miles on it and the tranny bucks like a horse at least 3 times a day. Cadillac has reprogrammed some kind of computer but it keeps doing it and they say that there is nothing that they can do to fix it. It also idles very rough, the first month we had it it was fine and now it vibrates so badly at stop lights that it is embarrassing. Cadillac told me to use premium, I have and it still does it.Sometimes the power lift gate does not want to work. Should've gotten a 08 Sequoia</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features would have to be the navigation system and the power lift gate.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I own a 2007 and a 2008 ESV - Both Black on Black with 24" non-stock rims. BEAUTY: I truly love the vehicles luxury, style, class, and SIZE, there's nothing better offered by any manufacturer. But here is what I find missing, or don't like. 
1) No light in the glove box. 
2) No auto-down windows, except drivers door. 
3) Cheap battery. 
4) No telescope steering wheel. 
5) Small brakes. 
6) No independent suspension. NO BRAWN: 
7) The Escalade at 403HP is grossly underpowered. I am forced to switch the vehicle into tow-mode, to get higher revs out of each gear, in order for it to perform decently. Unfortunately, when in tow- mode, it down-shifts like a jake-brake! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This Caddy (ESV) is an absolute dream. The sheer presence is impressive. Everyone that sees this thing loves it. When quickly accelerating the exhaust reminds of the race cars in "Days of Thunder". What a sound - almost better than my Vet. When you enter the car at night, the lighting, both inside and out, are unbelievable. Everything about this vehicle exudes luxury. I have read some complaints about the trans. But, I like the way it works. It tends to quickly go to the next gear. You have to go nearly 80 MPH to get to 2K PRM - an amazing engine. Still, if you're in hurry, you just need to punch it and it takes off. Like the TV ad says, if the Escalade had a bathroom, I'd live in it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, inside and out; sound system; NAV; DVD; retractable running boards- AWESOME; amazing exhaust sound; powerful V8; heated and cooled seats; heated second seats - kids love this and the dual DVD screens; power hatch; 22in wheels/tires-you sit massively high off the ground; so much more. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My previous model ESV 2004, had features that I felt made it a luxury vehicle. The 2008 seats are hard, do not hold you in position when cornering. The sun visor is poor. Previous model had more flexibility. Headrest ability to bend forward is now seriously lacking. I happened apparently to be one of the few people that used the disc changer system under random ALL. Since the addition of the backup camera this feature has been removed. This last item damed near stopped the purchase. I now wish that I had purchased a Mercedes GL 550. Which at this point in time will be my next purchase; and most likely sooner than later. This is my 10th new Cadillac purchase in a row.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>No Favorites with this model. The people that are allowed to design these vehicles do not own them, it is very obvious. The 2004 had superior ride and better amenities. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my first Cadillac in October of 07 and have been happy with the experience so far. Exterior style is pretty much the best aspect of the car. It's classy and has an edge. The ride is luxury car smooth for the most part. I don't feel tired most of the time I drive home from a long day at work. Fuel economy is average at best but I expected that. At $3.10/gal a fill up is $60, which lasts me about a week. Build quality is as good as other luxury cars. Lots of cheap plastic and panels that do squeak and come off. It looks good though. Nav system is great. Seats are comfy. And caddy dealers are willing to deal a little for the car. All in all I'm very satisfied</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, smooth ride, ergonomic interior, air conditioned seats, very roomy</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Cadillac is on a role, and the Escalade is no exception. It has great looks, lots of luxury and features, 403 hp, and an exhaust note from a muscle car. I never thought i would buy and SUV, but the Escalade sold itself. The power and exhaust note surprised me most as it is quick (for and SUV), and sounds great. The handling also really surprised me as it handles like a much smaller car. The only negatives i can fin is the old school tilt only steering wheel, third row seat ( everything about it from room to not power folding), and a light in the rear of the car rattles. The GPS in this car is absolutely fantastic, it is the highlight of an already great interior. Just a great SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife just loves the car. We added 22" aftermarket rims on it at 1/3 the cost of what the dealer wanted and it looks much better. No mechanical issues experienced as noted by several previous postings. It's fun to drive and does exactly what I expected when I bought it - looks great, drives great, and hauls as a big rig!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Decided on the 08 AWD Escalade after test driving the 08: MDX, GL320 & 450, Q7, Range Rover Sport, X5, & Sequoia Platinum. We decided to roll the dice on GM after getting an unbelieveable deal on a lease. Now anyone doing homework on the Escalade knows this SUV has pros/cons. Reliability issues, possible wind noise, gas mileage...and while we liked the GL 320 & 450 the pricing was too good to pass up on the Caddy. Wife loves it. Tons of room inside, great rear-entertainment (unfortunately it blocks rear view mirror. No problems to date though. We love the curb appeal as well. I will say anyone shopping an large SUV must check out the 08 Seqouia Platinum. Understated & loaded!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, OnStar & Verizon cell phone integration with the OnStar system, cabin space/storage, horsepower, back- up camera, touch screen nav and ability to view DVD in front while SUV in park, throaty exhaust note, acceleration and horsepower. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just leased a black/black 2008 Escalade. I love it, I got the Ultra Lux. Pkg. I love the 22?s and the Nav. I have had a lot of nice cars (only 23) I had a 2005 TL(non nav) loved it, a 2006 MDX (touring with nav) loved it, so I was a little concerned about buying American. I can?t stop talking highly about my new truck, my GF loves it, all the girls love it. Fast & very athletic with the stock 22?s. I was very happy that it did fit into my garage. Cant wait to take it snowboarding, and towing the bikes down south on those long trips. A must, tint your windows in the front to match back, and if you have the chance, tell your dealer to not install front plate. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The look & appearance, you get looks and attention everywhere,I love the OnStar, used it once when I locked out at the clubs @ 2:00am, Bose Sound, and the 403 HP engine! Mileage isn't bad either @ 14.5 mpg on 93(hey you know what your buying before you buy it....this isn't no Civic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Transmission went bad with 2000 miles on it.After 5 attempts to have it fixed they finally found the problem. It is an engineering flaw that GM said do not repair,there is no repair and it is on all 07 & 08 models. I'm crushed I paid $68k and no fix for Cadillac's engineering flaw, I asked them how much on trade they said $48k so a $20k loss on a problem that GM knows about and will not repair and will not warn potential buyers, how low can you go? Learn thru my mistake on trusting Cadiilac, and ask about this engineering flaw, the service dept. knows about it they have documents in their file that they can show you but you can't make a copy of it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Mechanically this car is junk. It is a new engine transmission combo for GM and they definitely didn't nail this one. Maybe in a few years they can make it better. I have had both engine and transmission problems with it and it only has about 12000 miles. JD Powers has rated it a 2 star for mechanical quality and that is very generous of them. All the good reviews are just for 1st drives and the looks after you have it a little while you will see the poor quality of this vehicle! And this is coming from a GM man that has always liked and bought GM! </TEXT>
