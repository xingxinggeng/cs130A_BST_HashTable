<TEXT>I had trouble with my Sedona when new; the battery kept draining. It took the dealer awhile to find the problem (a computer module wasn't connected tightly), but they were so helpful, and KIA even called me a couple times during the repair without me asking for their help. I was impressed with their customer service; it made an annoying issue easier to deal with. Once that little problem was solved, the van has been a dream. I took it on an 1800 mile trip last month, and it performed flawlessly and was so relaxing to drive. Normally that kind of trip tires me out, but the driving comfort is so great that I was able to drive lots further in a day than normal. I can't wait to take more trips.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very comfortable. Acceptable road noise. Gets pretty good mileage for a V6 behemoth 25 mpg on highway at 70 mph. Controls are easy to use. Lots of nice standard safety features. Came with Michelins. Can take second row seats out and sleep in it when camping - which I do often!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> Sedona has most of the equipment that is expected. Can haul a lot of stuff and has a lot of room. However, it has a vibration in the front end that makes this vehicle a big dissapointment. Tires have all been changed out however vibration remains. I think KIA needs to address issues like this unless they do not care if they retain customers.....BEWARE...JUST A HEADS UP..........</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've always had SUV's since we started our family. But decided to downsize from our 07 Suburban to this minivan. I was kinda sad b/c the Suburban looked "cooler" but WOW! I love this car and so does my husband. We have 4 small children and the Sedona is hands down the most convenient and comfortable auto we've had. I love almost everything about it. Almost. There are only a couple things to bring up. The interior cloth is cheap looking. Wish we got the leather. And although it seats 7,if you have to seat 5 kids I wouldn't recommend this car for you. The back bench seat is narrow so 3 kids in the back is tight. And the poor kid who has the middle gets an uncomfortable seatbelt</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks nice and drives awesome. Love all the extra storage everywhere and huge glove compartment. LOVE the huge floor mats that basically cover the entire floor. Fits 4 kids and 2 adults very comfortable</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My recent Sedona is my second one. I love the Kia. It takes care of my family of five and beyond normal servicing, I rarely have taken it to the dealership.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features include the interior comforts and the easy handling of the vehicle. For a minivan it has an excellent turn radius.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've been driving our new vehicle for over a month. I am very pleased with our new '08 Kia Sedona EX (has power doors/power gate). We got a good deal, I think, being a 2008 model (paid 18.7K). It has been working great, drives well, works perfectly. It gets decent highway gas mileage (23.5 or better hwy). The middle seats are so comfortable; much better than stow-n-go seats. I love that the middle windows roll down, but I guess most minivans have that feature these days. CON: The driver's seat arm rest is too low. I can tilt the arm rest up and use it, but I wish I could actually raise the whole arm rest. Same with the front passenger arm rest. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power doors/power tail gate/power middle windows/comfy middle seats/cup holders/manual up or down shift. Our 3 kids love opening the doors and closing them all by themselves. But, I can prevent them from access if needed. The older kids can also recline their seats (ages 5 & 6) all by themselves.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had owned 3 other minivans, wife wanted another despite kids being much older. Shopped around a fair bit have always owned NA, decided to look at alternatives. Most features for the least amount of money. Great ride, lots of room. Gas mileage is not much different than was claimed 17.9 mpg combined over the last 8 months.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth quiet ride, lots of power. Well built, all pieces and parts fit togther like they should. Stow a way rear seats. Cavernous</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a 2002 Sedona with 175,000 miles on it, that I just traded in to purchase my 2008 Sedona. I loved my 2002, and find that my 2008 is as good if not better!! It's very versatile, comfortable and a great deal for the money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We drove a rented Sedona in 2008 to Florida. Good van for long trips and we were impressed. We kept waiting for a 2008 with a few miles on it to become available. Finally did in May and we snatched it up. Bought the van for a little over $15K with 11K miles on it. Pick up is as good as my 2006 Monte Carlo. Great ride and comfortable as I am 5'3". The only complaint is no MP3 jack and the stereo really needs to be better quality. Got used to RDS display on the Monte Carlo and miss it. Other than the radio, it's been great for hauling my german shepherd and my toddler granddaughter. Also there's no outside temperature guage which i find odd.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent pick up, all the room, folding seats</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 2008 Sedona was purchased new less than a month ago and has fewer than 500 miles on it. It is in the shop now for the second time because the battery goes dead 4 times, requiring roadside assistance each time, and has been there for 5 days now without a diagnosis. I truly love driving this van, but am starting to think I made a huge mistake purchasing it. I haven't even received my license plates yet and it's been in the shop 6 days already! Thankfully, the dealer is a gem and doing everything they can to help me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drives very "fun" for a behemoth vehicle. If they can ever get it running reliably and I can trust it enough to drive it anywhere, it MAY be a wonderful vehicle. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We're expecting twins next month and couldn't avoid the inevitable minivan purchase (2 carseats in a Sentra just wouldn't cut it!). My father was the one who steered me towards a Kia based soley on its reviews and warranty. I test drove all the major brands and to my surprise, the Kia stood far out in my opinion. You get a LOT for your money (especially with the rebates) and it's actually comfortable to drive. Some of the vans out there seriously make you feel like you're driving a bus! I would recommend the Kia Sedona to anyone looking for a minivan, even recommend the brand to anyone just looking for a car! I was always a Nissan person, but I'm glad I opened my eyes to Kia.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love, love, love how the 2nd row sliding doors windows roll down! You don't see this feature in many other brands. Also love the ease of storing the 3rd row seats and the flexibility of putting them up and down. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We got this vehicle. I wished we hadent. The dealer didn't tell us that it would only get 14 miles to a gallon. The sticker says over 21 mpg. He didn't tell us that we had to pay $300.00 to get it servaced at 30,000. It keeps on dieing on us. So please spread the word don't buy kia.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Previously had 3 Chrysler Mini Vans but 5 transmissions so time for a change. The 5K rebate got me. So far the van is fine. Mileage seemed to be as issue with many but I am very happy with mine so far (2000 miles). 18 in the city and 24-25 on the thruway which is better than expected.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Sedona is a lower initial cost minivan vs. competition. The 10yr/100K warranty provides some insurance if you are concerned about Kia's long term reliability. The Sedona is a great family minivan; functional. Very powerful engine, smooth drive, shifts well. You can buy a new 2008 LX for under $16K with negiotiating. I drove Honda's for years, still do, but the Sedona pricing was too good to pass up. I need to have $7K in repairs to break even with purchasing a Honda or Toyota. Great value. </TEXT>

<TEXT>You kidding me? this van rocks. Safety, roomy, has it all, drives like a champ. A new van like this for under 17k? Bought the leftover 08 with 30 miles on it. I cant understand how anyone cannot buy this van for the price. I think its BETTER than the 30k hondas etc.Lokks great, feels great, and you just feel safe and confident.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It has great "get up and go", which I wasn't expecting in a vehicle this size. There is storage galore, all seats are easily reclined, folded, tumbled, removed, etc. Very sharp/sporty looking exterior, especially with the roof racks. Now for the "buts", which are only 2 so far: About 25 minutes into our drive home from the dealer, we noticed a rattle, or vibration in both the sliding doors which got worse and worse. By the time we got home an hour later, the rattle was pretty much constant, even over bumps as small as seams in the pavement, and sewer lids. We're going back to the dealer tomorrow for that, and because the cd player doesn't work, which probably just means a new stereo. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sport Shift mode is fun; fold-flat seats are simple to use, tumbling second row are easy; powerful motor; tons of storage; roomy cabin, easy to move around in; exterior very NOT soccer-mom; </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought Kia Sedona 2007 due to my past good experience with products from Samsung and I was fooled by 10 year 100,00 miles warranty. The vehicle broke down within 1 year and took them 4 months to find what was wrong. Before they found out the root cause, they blamed me for putting a wrong type of gas in the tank. They told me that their vehicles do not take gas from Costco, Wal-Mart or Quick Trip. This 10 year, 100,000 miles is not the sign of their confidence on their products, but a fake cover over their bad quality products and services. I almost had heart attacks dealing with their people. I hope you do not have to go through what I have gone through.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased in South & drove back to Midwest. 1st city tankful @ 17 and next 3 hwy tankfuls @ 22-23 MPG. Should improve. Handling, comfort & performance exceeded expectations. Seats are firm yet supportive. One day drove 500 miles and we were not fatigued. Visibility is good. SWB is right length for grandkids. Sedona is rated "safest" minivan of all and key influence of our purchase. Price was also a leading factor. Similar sized V6 Toyota, Honda (Sienna, Pilot, RAV4) out the door in low 20s. Ours was in lower teens. Nice riding safe vehicle. Ride quality and feel better than its MSRP. Great buy w quality & warranty TBD. Now has 1,700 miles. We do a lot of driving and feel very confident. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety. HVAC system is very effective. Heats up in a hurry. Can also be controlled in 2nd row seats, nice feature. Surprisingly responsive. Handling is very good given 4,400 lb. Gold color has gold flecks in paint, nice touch. Exterior doesn't look like lower end priced vehicle w many compliments. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I previously owned a 2006 Sedona and loved it. I traded it in on a 2008 Dodge Gr Caravan SXT. I was very unhappy. I purchased a new 2008 Sedona LX w/rear DVD system. It comes very well equipped in LX trim. Extended wheelbase is the one to choose over the short. Safety features are the best in the industry. I would prefer power seats, but it was not worth the extra money of the EX. The powertrain is fantastic, powerful and smooth. It possesses confident handling. Braking is excellent. I chose Midnight Black w/Beige interior, the interior color is very soothing to look at. My 2006 was White w/Grey. I became tired of the grey w/the grey skies of Seattle. I love all the room, especially the headroom. PLEASING ! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been shopping for a while and done much research on the Sienna, Odyssey and Sedona. All are great vehicles but I just couldn't justify spending $5K more and for less features on the the Honda or Toyota. Plus not to mention the 10 yr warranty. Kia dealers are giving employee pricing (you must ask) plus huge rebates on 2008's. This is a great time to be in the market. Kids love it and can't wait to take it anywhere. Kia Sedona is the best value for the money on the market today.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Sedona. I had a 2004 model and traded it due to high miles for a new cross-over. Big mistake! After the first week I wanted my Sedona back. I just bought my second Sedona Ex a 2008 model. I already love it! My kids love it. It has an even better look and the inside is even more comfortable. I love all the storage space it offers .I feel confident I will be driving it for many years to come. It keeps getting better and better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Why buy one of those Japanese brands, when you have equal quality, less the damage to your checking acct. This car has blown my wife and I away (plus 2 kids). We traded '04 xterra and are pleased with our decision. We have a fully loaded EX, Black, leather int, ALL packages. We went to see it and were surprised at the luxury the Sedona has; the standards and extras were bonus. I can't imagine what car an negative reviewers drove, but this car is mostly quiet, smooth, and Fast! The sports mode, "stick-shift", adds to the fun! plenty of room, great visibility, great handling. Very nice! why bother with the Japanese high priced vans?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the Sedona mostly because of price - it already was at the top end of what I could afford. But having at least comparison shopped the other vans, and having driven it now for a few months, you will not do better at any price. The look of the new Chrysler is downright repulsive, and you have to spend thousands of dollars extra to get the only competitive powertrain of the bunch. The Toyota is priced hopelessly high, the Nissan has given too many people trouble, and our local Honda dealers do not have good reputations. But even without all of that, there is nothing this van lacks. It gets far better mileage than my last one as well. Maybe THE best value in the industry.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety in abundance, and anything that you would want that may already be in other minivans, but you can get for less money. My personal favorite is the EX cloth - incredibly comfortable, but I guess rather rare (most are either LX cloth or EX leather).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased a new Kia Sedona ex with all the bells and whistles. The more I drive the Sedona the more I love it. Jd power rates the quality better than Honda Odyssey. I've done a lot of research before I purchased the Kia. You are not going to find a better van which is safer, great value for the dollar than the Sedona. Plus the sports triptronic transmission is a nice feature. The Sedona also puts out 250 horse power, giving it a lot of power for a minivan. Gas mileage is on par with toy/Honda. The interior is very nice in leather with the heated seats, dvd player, sunroof, automatic door opener, abs, ets system, 5 star crash rating and the list goes on. Plus a great 10 yr warranty.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather interior, exterior finish, sports shifter, side windows go down, dvd player w/ wireless head sets, lots of storage especially behind the 3 rd row. Seat position memory, saftey features galore and 10 yr warranty. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We do a lot of family driving and think we know mini-vans pretty well. We have owned Dodge, Chrysler & Chevy Mini-vans and when it was time to replace our last thought we really did our homework! One of our neighbors recently got a beautiful looking van so we while talking to them we discovered it was a KIA. They loved it and bragged on about it. So we did even more homework and found we could get everything we wanted and save 4 to 6 thousand over Honda & Toyota! And that 10 Year Factory Warranty was more than twice that of the others. It became a no brainer for us. We love our new KIA Sedona. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After test driving and researching other mini-vans, we found the Kia Sedona to be the best performer and the best value. I gave up my SUV- loving ways and purchased a minivan in preparation for the birth of our first child. I can now safely say that I don't miss my SUV at all! With a baby on the way and two dogs to transport, this van really is the most convenient and fun vehicle I have driven. Great handling and features like the stow away third row seats have made us thrilled with our decision.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is not what I expected. It looks good in the pictures, but is totally different in person. It's very wide and fat. The blueish color is disgusting, if you get this vehicle don't get the blue color. The interior is also bad. The fabric used for the seats looks and feels horrible. There is also not a lot of leg room, or storage. The vehicle drives like it is very stiff, and jerks every few seconds. I recommend getting a different vehicle, anything but this. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just weeks from giving birth to my second child, I have been experiencing problems with my 2000 Volvo S40 and feel it's time to do the minivan thing. My husband and I were not expecting to enjoy our test drive of the Sedona, but it has tremendous pick- up and was actually kind of fun to drive, relatively speaking! Its styling, convenience features and functionality are all worthy of minivan-style praise, and it feels like a great value for the money. </TEXT>
