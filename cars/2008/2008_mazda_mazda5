<TEXT>About 1.5 years of ownership now. Great reliable vehicle. We bought it as the perfect 4 person family car and then got a surprise #3 child and it is not perfect for that but its ok. I added a roof rack and cargo box and thats takes care of storage issues on long trips. I should add I got 28-29 mpg on a recent road trip fully loaded down , roof box on top, and bikes</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Really not liking it</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>So we have now had this car for a little over a year and i would honestly say that i have had nothing but problems.After two months of purchase we hit a stick in the middle of the road and ended up with a whole the size of a softball in the gas tank and that was not covered by warranty. We have had to purchase several gas caps costing $65 each and a new gas intake. I also have had water spraying out the vents with the air conditioner on.This should not happen when you buy a new car all we have done is put more money in to this car then its worth and to top it off its such a hard car to try and trade in for a better car the dealerships DON'T WANT IT. I will never purchase a Mazda AGAIN ~!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It gets great gas mileage, The sliding doors and the manual transmission.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love, Love this car and it has been over a year now that we are driving it. I needed a family of four type of car with room for more kid passengers or grandparents on trips. This car was it! I did not want a large minivan and needed better mileage for my long trips on highway to visit family. Some reviewers complained a little about the road noise, I don't notice it at all. I previously owned a V6 pontiac grandAm and the Mazda 5 satisfies the need for pickup and speed. Drives great! The only thing I wish I did when I was getting the car was get one with a roof rack. It would be so useful on long family vacations.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Does not drive like a minivan, it has a lot of pep and moves like a small car. The stereo 6-CD changer and the sliding doors </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have a newborn and before purchasing the Mazda 5 we had a mid-size sedan. It was a hassle to put the baby in and out of the car. We bought this car for the following reasons: 1. good gas millage 2. comfortable for the baby 3. design, So far it has met our expectations. We are more than pleased with our purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It's been almost a year now since I bought the 5. It is my daily commuter. I was told to drive it like a sports car and I do. Commonly doing 85 in the interstate. Love the size and ease in parking. Still don't see many around and it fits our family of four. Better gas mileage than our Honda Oddy. Only issue with the 5 was that I couldn't get the gas cap off. It was a recall. All is fixed. I would buy another. Recently took it on four hour vacation, everything fit and mileage was great. Cant wait to see what the new one will look like. Most people don't know what it is. I like that. It stands out in a crowd. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great little van for small families. Handling is really smooth, "Zoom Zoom", as they say. Very dependable. Lots of little nooks in the driver's side to stash cell phone, sunglasses, cosmetics. Easy to reach radio and temperature controls. Handy storage under middle bucket seats. Seats very easy to fold and slide where you need them to be. Ample storage when third row is folded down. But, if you've got people in the third row, forget about putting any luggage, groceries, or even school backpacks in the back.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet, smooth ride. Easy to handle. Gas mileage is fair. With A/C in summer average 22 mpg. Other times of year, best I saw was 29 mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We looked at everything in this price class,new and used. CR-V, RAV 4, Subaru Forester, Kia Rondo,Suzuki Grand Vitara. Nothing offered the combination of fun and function like the Mazda. This is not meant as a replacement for the minivan from Honda, Toyota,etc. You must drive this "microvan" before passing judgment on it. If you appreciate sharp steering and handling over a softer ride, you will not be disappointed. Bottom line: If you need to haul a small family around or just some stuff AND have fun doing it, the Mazda 5 is for you! It was for us! For those complaining about snow traction. Get four snow tires. 205/50/17 all season tires were never meant for snow!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, features on the Grand Touring like Bluetooth and Xenon headlamps, fuel mileage, the hiding places in the interior,exterior styling. The 5 is still fairly rare in my area, so I don't see another one everyday,which is kinda fun!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had our vehicle for over a year. Power steering keeps cutting out, brakes squeak like mad in the rain, dealer seems unable to fix either problem. We drive 34,000 km per year, are a family of 5 with 3 smaller sized teens, this is our only car. No where in the middle seats to put a drink down (our vehicle does not have the under seat fold out holder - which is annoying in itself). The back window never seems to stay clean, no matter how often we wash it, car washes seem to never get the whole back of the car. It is fun to drive, and looks great, gets excellent mileage BUT it is uncomfortable, and the person in the back row is either hot or cold. Needs AWD for North American snow</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the look of the car, the sliding door panels, and it is fun to drive. The wipers come on automatically when it rains - love that feature!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Excellent Car. Have a family of 4 and needed the extra row in case we drove family and or friends. The kids love the sliding doors, and the storage under the seats. My wife and I love the excellent gas mileage. It is easy to drive - perfect for around town. Turns on a dime and has plenty of zoom. The other night I helped a friend move two couches - no problem with the seats down. Interior space is surprisingly large. With the 3rd row seats up, you have plenty of room for groceries. This car is perfect for a family watching their money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning for 4 months we hit a tire late at night on the freeway at about 70-75mph. There were about a half dozen other cars who hit the same tire. Only suffered minor damage to front end (a little expensive to fix) whereas the other cars required a tow to get home we drove off just fine. The rear seats can fir full-sized adults (6' 200lbs males) for sort durations, but are great for smaller adults and children. With the third row folded it takes most everyday challenges. LOVE the sliding doors and small size compared to other minivans. We can open the rear hatch with the garage door closed. Parking in a crowded parking lot is a blast, you can even park 'against the grain'! Love IT!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sliding doors and third room seating option. Great fuel economy. Nice looking car. The white exterior with light colored fabric interior along with tinted windows keeps this cooler in desert summers by 15-20 degrees! Recommended for anyone in So.Cal</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Hate it, way too small, cheaply made, inside scuffs easily, only 2 choices for exterior color if you don't want the too light cream interior-ugly gray and too hot black. The front passenger seat is so small it's claustrophobic, useless trunk with 3rd row up, 2nd row barely fits 2 small kids and their back packs. The worst vehicle I've had in 35+ years of driving. My 13 year old van I got rid of for this car was far superior. AC is not intuitive. Car is too narrow to fit my soccer foldable chair in. I guess if you buy cheap,you get cheap.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>fun to drive, like that back seat splits as well as the cover for the trunk splits, like arms rests in middle and cubby between seats, but that's it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I can't think of another vehicle with this much functionality AND good gas mileage. You might get more room from a full size minivan, but you also will only get 16-17 mpg in the city. I have received 23-25 mpg in the city and 28 highway. I bought this car used after I had a chance to rent one. The third row is small but is just fine for your kids. I have sat back there and wouldn't mind sitting there for around town outings. It's just nice to have the option to transport up to six people occasionally. I owned a 2002 Protege which was a litte unrefined regarding road noise. This is no Lexus but definitely is improved and more than satisfactory, even on the highway. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling, low price, fuel economy, third row seating, good safety ratings, generous standard features, the power is satisfactory with enough acceleration ability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With two babies, I love the fact that there are sliding doors. It's sleek design makes me feel like I am in a space shuttle. :) The fabric is easy to clean. I live in a small town with no highways, so driving around I get 29-30 mpg...which is awesome!! The price was decent too. Never thought that I would own a Mazda...went to buy a Nissan truck with my husband and saw this vehicle and fell in love. I am so happy that we bought it. Plus, the Mazda version of AAA is really reliable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We looked at all vans, but balked at the $! Mazda hit it right with price and features. We have 2 teens, and most of the time the 3rd seat is folded flat. Much usable space this way, and easy to convert if hauling more kids around. Tough going in the snow, the GT wheels look cool, but the wide, low profile tires are tough in the snow. As I told my wife, they do plow here, and we only had issue when everyone else did too, so no biggie. Love the Bluetooth, all the nooks and crannies, and total flexibility in this good looking little mover. We also love how sporty it drives, how well it parks and fits in the garage, and the zesty copper paint!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats, I-Pod port, stereo sounds great, climate control, adjustable headlights, and the trick 2nd row seats, fuel economy, (25 mph avg so far) with a smaller tank to save $ at the pump!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well we have had our 2008 mazda5 sport for over 6 mos now and figured it was time to give our thoughts. First living in a snowy, hilly area the winter handling and hill climbing power are both average at best. It lags at hill climbing, especially at highway speeds. Fuel efficiency has been pretty good maybe even a little better than rated. The interior design is very accommodating &comfortable. The rear seats are easy to fold/unfold and the design of the controls is very intuitive. Cargo space with the third row up is minimal but with it down we can easily fit our two week groceries and more in the back. Reliability has been perfect so far. Black interior impossible to keep clean.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cruise and radio controls on steering wheel. MP3 Jack which will also allow you to plug in a portable dvd player. Cargo space with third row seats folded.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased the Mazda5 to replace an aging and not very fuel efficient Ford Freestar minivan. As we still needed a vehicle that could sit at least 6 people but we wanted something more economical the scope of our search was limited. After test driving the Ford TaurusX, Rio Rondo and the Mazda5 and comparing the prices for each it was quickly obvious that the Mazda5 was the best choice. After 6 months of use we are thrilled with our choice. We've been getting 26 mpg in all around driving and 30 mpg on exclusively highway miles. The engine has plenty of pep and you can chirp the tires at a moments notice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>FUEL ECONOMY! Spacious interior, comfortable seating (even for adults in the third row of seats). Plenty of power - the 4cyl, 153hp engine has MORE than enough power to get you going even loaded with 4 adults, packed with gear and a 17 ft canoe strapped to the roof.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the car on Dec 31, 2007. 2008 Mazda 5 GT. Power is adequate. Acceleration is ok, handling is superb, great gas mileage. About 23-25 mpg in LA traffic, but I did log 31 mpg going to San Francisco with 3 adults and 2 kids. Took me a long time to decide between the new CRV to the 5, but I sincerely believe that I made the right choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Thought it would be a smaller alternative to a van, bought it when gas was $4.00+. It is way too small, can haul 6 people/4 with stuff, but not both. Cons: non-lighted mirrors, small useless cubbies without lids, industrial looking fabric, door ajar light doesn't specify which door, gas cap is very hard to get off, wimpy horn, can't close windows with car off, small sunroof, would switch volume with placement of radio change buttons (don't change volume often, but you always change stations, add on/off button), cubbie under middle seat can't be accessed while driving, sunshade is too short-useless, light in truck have off/on/door, armrest must be up to access back. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive, just wish it was a foot longer and a foot wider. The six seats is a big plus, that's what sold me on the car (since most small SUVs are only 5 seaters).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car!! It has every feature you want. I didn't want an suv or mini- van. This car is perfect. It is so much fun to drive. I didn't like the style at first. The car grows on you. All my neighbors compliment the car every time I see them. It's great for a small family. My 2 and half year old loves having his own seat too. The only down fall is my stroller fits on an angle. Also, the automatic car starter from Mazda is awesome. It worth every penny.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were looking for good gas mileage, the right price with optional 6 passenger seating when we spotted a 2008 Mazda 5. It is easy for the kids to open the sliding doors to get in and out. The second row seating is comfortable and has a great bin for toys and cups. Now I can pick up my friends kids or transport family when I need to. The Mazda 5 third row folds down so easily when not in use. I can't believe the ergonomic storage room . I bought a snow blower for my husband and there was no problem sliding it in the back of the car with room to spare. My 6'4 husband fits in the drivers seat but the glove box in the pass is tight. We are pleased with the overall performance of the 5.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love having the phone and radio/cd controls on the steering wheel. Heated seats and bluetooth are great! The sliding side doors are great in tight places. Comfortable arm rests. The easy folding third row is great and allows for good cargo area. The 5 is fun to drive! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded my Volvo 940 Wagon for the Mazda5 GT. Use primarily for business. I need cargo room, and hate SUVs. First, the gas mileage is awesome... 39 mpg on my recent road trip. Easy vehicle to work from. Sliding doors help. No mechanical issues, noises, squeaks or rattles. Really solid car. However, I miss the comfort of my Volvo. The seat bottoms are too short, and too narrow. The climate controls are way too complicated. The gas & brake pedals are too close together. As others have noted, the interior plastics are poor quality, and scuff easily. Storage is sparse. Map pockets in the doors are preferred to the bottle holders. There is a storage pocket behind the driver's seat only. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Mazda5 has been one of the most fun cars I've owned. After finding out we were going to become a family of six rather than five, we needed a vehicle that could hold us all and traded in our sedan. We already have a large minivan and I wanted something better on gas and a bit sportier, so we bought the Grand Touring. The four kids fit fine, though it is umbrella stroller only as there is almost no trunk space. Trips require use of the luggage rack with 5+ people. I love the nimbleness in traffic and the tight turn base and size makes parking a breeze. It definitely has some zoom-zoom compared to other family vans. The 5 is fun to drive, has nice features and I get about 26 mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Mazda5 displays welcomes you when turn on with a friendly, "Hello!" The automatic stuff is nice, including climate control, lights (which you can also turn off) and even the wind-shield wiper. The GT5 has integrated Bluetooth with very good call clarity. Phone/radio controls on the wheel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I bought a Copper Red Touring model just two weeks ago, after I spent almost a full year researching the 5. We have two young boys and only occasionally need to carry extra passengers, so this vehicle will be perfect for us. We leave the third-row seats folded flat, and it provides more cargo area (and more versatile use of that area) than a typical sedan. I find the ride rather comfortable -- a little stiff on pavement seams, but I think that's a deliberate trade-off Mazda made to achieve the sportier handling in line with its corporate image. And it does handle very nicely. This is our first Mazda, so we're hoping it will be as reliable as the Hondas we've had. So far so good.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All four rear seats fold down independently, making the cargo area quite versatile; handling; lots of standard features for the price; most of the benefits of a full-size minivan without the higher price and poor fuel economy; unique and sporty styling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We traded our Honda Pilot earlier this year for the Mazda5. The Pilot is a great car, but it's not the best if you're short (5'2") like me for getting children, groceries, and strollers in and out. The 5 is awesome! It has tons of room for a wagon or my bike plus room for the children. They can open the doors and get in themselves which is a blessing. And it's so much fun to drive. It's the best part of going to work. :) I haven't enjoyed a car this much since I had my beloved old Escort.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>They styling is like minivan eye candy. Love the extra space in the middle captain's chairs. Fantastic turning radius. I've tracked my MPG and it's 25.5. My husband gets 23 though with the zoom zoom. :) The steering wheel controls are great, as well as the moonroof. The Sirius and CD are fantastic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I read a lot of reviews about this vehicle from different websites and after some test drives, we bought this vehicle. I like the features but I totally dislike the stiff leather seats and the stiff ride. The road noise, harshness and vibration are pronounced. We used to have an 05 Toyota Sienna and this is not even a mile close to the comfort of it. This vehicle does have its strengths too but riding comfort is not one of them. I tried the other trims later, the sport and the touring with fabric seats, for comparison and they ride way better than the GT with leather, but still not even close though to the Sienna that I used to have. If I could just turn back the clock...</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought my Copper Red Mazda5 Touring in February. Traded a 2 door sports car. In early March I had a motorcycle accident and really messed up my foot. Have been on a walker ever since (not for much longer hopefully). Anyway, the 5 has been a Godsend. The sliding doors let me get in and out easily with my walker and all. And easily carried my wheelchair around and still had room to haul the groceries. Great utility+good looks! I've had no problems to date. My fuel economy is not great (21ish) but I still cannot think of another vehicle I would rather have. After I got mine, my cousin fell in love with it and bought one. And my father is going to pick one up this weekend</TEXT>

I am a confirmed Honda man. I only purchase Honda products just because that is what I've always done. All I have to say is this, Honda better watch their "6". This is a wonderful car 30.5 mpg mixed cty/hwy! This car is better than a Honda. I've owned 5 so far and may dedicate all future purchases to Mazda. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am 6'3" tall and wanted to get better gas mileage than my Aztek, but I didn't want to sacrifice a ton of leg room. My wife and I shopped for a RAV4, but the lack of leg room scared me away, specifically around the knees. The Mazda 5 has good leg room and is comfortable. My children can easily open and close the sliding doors. With a new child on the way one of the two other children is already looking forward to the third row. With the third row folded down there is plenty of storage space. When people are in the third row there is very little room, only enough for an umbrella stroller. This car is perfect for my daily commute. It is great for short jaunts or day trips.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The autostick makes driving a little more exciting and is great for on-ramp merges or highway passing. I have gotten used to the Bluetooth and miss it in my other vehicle. This car handles great and the seats are comfortable. The underseat storage is unique and very useful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Test drove all existing minivans and finally chose Mazda 5 as a compromise between practicality of a "grown up" minivan and drivability of a sedan. Considering its price this is nearly perfect vehicle: tiny outside but somehow very roomy inside - must be some sci-fi trick, unless it just a very thoughtful design. I also like the build quality and hope for a good reliability. And by the way, why don't they put sliding doors on all cars?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had to find a new car quickly and wanted good price, economy, and something that worked with two kids. Looked at numerous cars and the 5. Surprised that it was hard to find, but glad I did. Home town didn't have any and drove 60 miles to find the only Touring the dealer had. The white is really sharp! The 5 gets lots of stares and I think of it as a sport wagon rather than a mini van. I haven't seen another on the road in the few days we have owned it, couldn't say that about the Taurus and Altima that I was considering. We made a GREAT purchase! The kids think its cool too! This will be my everyday car, my wife drives a Honda Ody. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is "the almost perfect family car". I studied every possibility for our family and couldn't find the right match. I finally discovered the 5 and realized quickly it was the one. Space, quality, price, doors, features, design and MPG, it has it all. It's a pleasure to drive this car. I must admit some jealousy as we found the 5 in Switzerland with dark tinted glass and a sporty luggage rack system. It looks even better. The seating possibilities are endless and easy to play with. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Sport with M/T. Vehicle meets all my needs, lots of room, decent fuel economy, good price. The manual trans takes some getting used to. It has a very light engagement and is very easy to "top" a gear. I definitely will be tinting the rear windows to keep things cooler but the A/C works great. With almost 3,000 miles on it I am averaging about 22 mpg. Since all my driving is around town I find this acceptable but wished for more. Manual adjusting seats required me to get out of the car to raise the seat level. If you are willing to keep the RPMs up, acceleration is good. Overall I am very pleased and hope time will prove me right.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I needed a roomy vehicle to accommodate our new baby (and all the stuff that comes along too) as well as provide good gas mileage for commuting 60 miles per day for work. Seeing as a manual transmission is almost a requirement for me, my choices were limited. I compared the Mazda5 to a few mid-size sedans and found that none could compare in terms of space or price. My wife, who always swore she would never drive a minivan, loves it so much that she now wants to learn how to drive a manual so that she can drive my car instead of her CR-V. Our baby loves it too :) The 5 is so fun to drive that I feel like I'm driving a sporty car, not a Micro-Van - great mix of fun and practicality.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Availability of a manual transmission (a must for me). Gas mileage. Averaging 28 in 80% hwy, 20% city. Sliding doors - very easy to get baby in/out of vehicle and good for tight parking situations. Under-seat storage. Sporty ride/handling. Standard features for the money.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded down (size wise) from a Chrysler town and country, also have Jeep Cherokee and Mazda miata. As far as size, there is a noticeable difference. Some things also seem 'cheap' compared to the Chrysler. But we bought this car because of the price and gas mileage and sliding doors. Mostly for the gas mileage. Wish we could have found a galaxy grey with leather this late in the season.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've had this car about 8 months (first 2008 out of the dealership) and have been very satisfied with it. Gas mileage is about what was estimated (actual- 22 city, 30 highway), which is good for a minivan. For a family of 4, each person gets their own seat with a huge trunk (rear seats down), with the option of ferrying a couple of friends around for short trips. For the price and value, I don't know why I don't see more on the road (although I see more in Canada). Only issue that I see so far is the front grille seems too low to the ground and I worry about hitting it on a concrete divider when parking in a public lot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When my daughter decided to go to college in-state, we had enough funds to get her a new car for school. We decided the car should last her 10 years, so tried to figure out the car that she would love now as well as 10 years from now. Looked at 2009 Matrix, 2008 RAV-4, 2008 CR-V. Choice was RAV-4 UNTIL she drove Mazda 5. Fun to drive, seat layout, and cargo space won her over. The after-thought car became the obvious choice. She absolutely loves everything about it. About $2000 cheaper than the RAV-4 made me happy. She made a great choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been driving my Mazda 5 for about 3 months and couldn't be happier with it. I needed a larger car to accommodate my growing family (baby #2 is on the way). The Mazda 5 is perfect for my needs. Even though it is very compact on the inside, it is surprisingly roomy on the inside. It is easier to drive than a big, clunky mini-van. I can even fit it in most compact parking spaces. In addition it can seat 6, although I wouldn't recommend this car for a family of 4 unless you're not in need of much trunk space. The trunk is plenty roomy enough to fit my jogging stroller and groceries with the third row seats down, and the gas mileage is really good for a vehicle it's size. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1. Gas mileage: (this was a huge selling point for us) 2. Trunk size: (with 3rd row seats down) 3. Comfort 4. Compact on the outside yet roomy enough on the inside for a family of 4 5. Price: I was able to get a grand touring with Nav for the same price as a bottom line Sienna or Odyssey</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have a family of 4 with a 3 year old and an infant. Wanted to find a vehicle with a 3rd row so my wife could sit with the kids on long trips and entertain/distract them while I drive but still get decent gas mileage. So far the Mazda 5 has been great. Getting about 23 mpg city, 29 hwy. Able to put the kids in the middle row and my wife or even I (5'10) am able to sit in the back. For a day trip it is fine. There isn't much cargo space with the back seats up - so we will probably get a roof rack eventually. The handling is excellent, pick up is so-so but fine enough for a family car. Features on the GT make me feel like I got a luxury vehicle</TEXT>

<TEXT>Soon to be a family of 6 and all 3 of my kids fit comfortably (ages 13,6,3). Each kid loves having their own seat. Sold my 05 Tundra dbl cab to get this and don't regret it. At least with this car I don't feel like crying at the pump when it's fill up time. I'm very impressed with Mazda. Very well priced for what you get, for what is standard on this car, is usually a option on most others. It's a great solution for families that need the seating capacity of a SUV or minivan. The sticker price is less, and your gas bill will be a whole lot less. Best of all it drives like a sports car, not a minivan, so the husbands will have fun driving it. I do.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The standard front, side and curtain air bags. Auto air, sporty rims, projector headlight and rear led lights.

<TEXT>Very nice vehicle, particularly for the money. The HID headlight are great, the ride very smooth and yet sporty, engine power is fine, nice interior layout and decent fuel mileage. I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone with the need to transport 4 people (it can take six for shorter trips, less than 2 hours). The 5 spd auto is very nice, it auto downshifts when breaking for a corner coming down a hill to add engine breaking.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am in love with our Mazda5 Sport automatic! My husband and I were in the market for a vehicle that could seat our family of four, plus an additional 2 friends, grandparents, etc. I didn't want to go the minivan route - and we were trying to avoid a hulking SUV. We looked at the RAV-4 with a third-row seat and the Highlander, but decided to test the Mazda. We immediately loved the handling, seat configuration, fuel economy, and general versatility! It is also quite unique - and several of our friends have been really impressed by it. If you are considering getting the touring for the engine, we recommend just the sport auto because the engine is very peppy... no need to spend extra $</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really feel this is one gem of a car. It does so many things well that one wouldn't expect in a family car of this type. It's refined and performs well, yet it's still economical and affordable. It handles like a much smaller sports car (Miata/MX-5 and 3 DNA immediately apparent), has good pick up, a nice ride, a quiet interior, many luxury features, safety, comfort, convenience, good fuel economy AND loads of style/good looks. Can you get any better? I drive my 5 with pride and sing "Zoom Zoom Zoom" in my head while doing so.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With our third child on the way, we were looking for the most fuel efficient option for a family using three car seats. The Mazda5 accommodated three car seats comfortably, something that our sedan did not. On our first long-distance trip, we got 31 MPG! Our average is around 25 MPG, and that beats the average of 19 MPG for a regular minivan. Though there is not much cargo space, we love how easy it is to shift the seats to accomodate an extra person or haul something bulky. The Mazda5 is the most fuel-efficient option for a family like ours, and it is fun to drive! </TEXT>

Once I got into the Mazda5, it was truly ZOOM ZOOM ZOOM! The third rear seat is crampy though, so we only use it for emergencies when we need to haul around 6 people! Otherwise, our doggie fits perfectly with the seats flattend! I would recommend this car to any parent who wants to have enough room to fit everyone and everything, yet still feel young!</TEXT>

In mixed driving situations, I am averaging 28 MPG with my lowest numbers at 25 MPG and my highest highway-only tank at 33 MPG. This car is peppy, sporty, and eye-catching (lots of comments from others). We'll be taking it soon on its first cross-country trip. I may have more to report then. To this point, I say "Thumbs up.

To get the Bluetooth, DVD system, etc., on other makes, you have to buy the top of the line. Not worth it ! The gas mileage is much better too, and these days that factors into the purchase greatly.

The size looks small, but, it is perfect for our family of 4 plus two others when needed. Plenty of comfort, room, quiet, and peppy engine - now I know why they say zoom zoom in the commercials! Have had the car two weeks and just filled up the tank yesterday. MPG was 23, with mostly city driving. I expect a couple more MPG with a broken in engine. I can't wait for a road trip. I expect 28-30 on the highway - if not, I'll write another review. This is a must see and drive on your list. We bought it over a new Honda Odyssey due to cost and fuel mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In our opinion there is no better car for a family with young kids and realistic size needs. This is a fun, well thought out and economical car. We love having a manual which is just not an option with most minivans/small SUVs. Also fun to have a car that turns people's heads! We consider this a station wagon with the added bonuses of seating for six and sliding doors versus thinking of it as a mini-minivan. We have the base model with no added options and it is amazing how much Mazda has packed into this car for such a good price. It is a hard to beat combination. </TEXT>

I am 6'3" and did not have to push the seat all the way back to feel comfy. We have 2 kids and they fit just right on the middle seats. Love the sliding doors. The back door opens up so even I won't have to worry about hitting my head. Kids love it, wife loves it. It is the first time I have heard my wife say about a car that is good looking.
