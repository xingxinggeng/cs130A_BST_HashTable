<TEXT>I am very happy with the purchase of my 2008 Focus SES except for 1 thing. It came with the Moon and Tune Package. But the treble on the radio fades in and out constantly. A mechanic rode with me and told me it's because my Sirius-capable radio is being interrupted by all the towers in the area and the only possible fix would be to renew my subscription. It drives me crazy. Does anyone else have this problem? Not sure I agree with him.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the car new. At 33,000 miles I have replaced the tires, had several minor problems fixed, and as of today, I have my third transmission. After the repairs and frequent tows, I have contacted Ford. But, instead of helping, they congratulated me on buying the extended warranty. I have always owned Ford products, but after today and Ford's response to my lemon, I will not own another Ford once I can get rid of this one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Focus. I have had no issues with it yet. It has almost 24000 miles. I've taken it every 3000 to get the oil changed and got routine service done to it. I got up to 49 MPG hwy. From Louisville, KY to Morehead, KY I averaged 41 MPG. It's just like any other car- you have to take care of it. If you drive it aggressively, just with any car, there is more of a chance with something going wrong with it. I have had no problems and no complaints. I put maybe $20 in per week. I worked for a honda dealership and I would much rather drive a focus than a civic. Bottom line: good purchase. I am going to drive mine until it falls apart! I am very happy with ford. Buy American!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car, but it is chewing up the tires. At 30,000 miles I put on a new set of tires. Now 12,000 miles later it appears I need to replace more tires. I have them rotated at every oil change. But I can now see obvious wear and it appears that the car is out of alignment, since it has a wicked shake at around 65 mph. Car is great but it is eating up the tires.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a 2001 Ford Focus ZX4 and was so impressed, I bought another one. The 01 handled like a slot-car while the 08 handles more like a rear wheel sports' car. The gas mileage in the 08 is quite a bit better than the 01. The fit and finish on both cars were good. Very impressed with SYNC. We have 2 cell phones and SYNC seamlessly works with both. The only thing I would change is the inside door handles on the coupe, which is in an awkward spot. Forget iPods - I have all my tunes in a thumb-drive and I can tell SYNC what to play, how cool is that?? </TEXT>

<TEXT>Biggest mistake I ever made, was buying a Ford Focus. Its used up 17 tires in 80000 km. 3 of the tires were legit, due to nails found. But the remaining were due to bad alignment, crappy suspension, and dust/dirt in rims. I will never buy a Ford product again. Also, the amount of dust that gets through the stripping around the doors is insane. My car is always filthy but I was told thats just a Ford Focus, its how they're made. Its fun to drive and good on gas, but its the biggest mistake I have ever purchased.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for over a year and have had no problems. It is very fun to drive, and like most Ford's, it has a lot of power. Being a coupe there is still a lot of room for passengers and the trunk is huge. Small and easy to get in and out of parking spaces, especially good for college parking. Easy to control and steer. Great design inside and out. This model is much more appealing than the earlier and even later models. Overall a great buy and would not want anything else. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love my Sync! It is a must, especially with the no cell phone laws. Artist/song shows on the console and Ipod plug is easy to use. Also reads the artist/song when playing. Leather wrapped steering wheel, rims, and silver siding. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this for fuel mileage. I got 28.6 MPG on my first tank but I did a lot of coasting and slow acceleration The vast majority of my driving is in town. I haven't done any highway driving yet. It is my first ford and it is very comfortable to drive with a lot of pep for a 4 cylinder. I would leave a lot of room for passing though - Especially on a hill. I love the sync system. It has a volume control so I can hear well on the phone and others say they can hear me very well also. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone that does alot of driving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car! I have only had it for one week and I am always looking for excuses to drive it. I got the SE with a 5 speed. The transmission is geared perfect and makes the car an absolute blast to drive. It handles great. It is comfortable and roomy even for me (I am 6'1"). The gas mileage has been great too! I average 37 or more on the highway and around 32 in town. Doesn't get much better than that! The car also has plenty of power. I can squeal the tires in 1st 2nd and 3rd gears. It is fast when you want it to be and gets great gas mileage when you take it easy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the smart start feature. It is so neat that the car starts itself. I also love the controls. They are clear and easy to use. I did not get sync but I hear that it is also neat. I love the manual transmission. If you like driving a manual this is a great car. It shifts great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drive 50/50 city and the highway, and I average 32 mpg after 2 months. It's quick and responsive for a 4 cylinder, and I love all the technology gadgets. Didn't think I'd love Sync or Sirius so much. It is nice and quiet so I can hear them both well. I tested small cars from Toyota and Honda, but both are uncomfortable cars for big and tall people (Toyota is terrible for long legs and Honda is terrible for head room). I can see my car from my office window, and to my surprise, this car turns a lot of heads. I think the leg room could still be better, but I'm glad I bought this car. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>California Driver</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I live in Calif so this car is almost polution free with the PZEV system, (grilling a burger produces more Hydro Carbons than a 100 mile trip) it may cut into the MPG but I am getting 31 combined in the LA area and 36 on a recent road trip along the california coast with varing speeds and hills and with stops in towns on the way. So I am really pleased with this fun to drive car. My business partner bought a Toyota Yaris as it gets 37-39 but on highway speeds the road noise is terrible and the stearing is by wire so it does not handle near as nice as the focus, and is very slow to get up and going compared to the focus, 1.5 vs. 2.0. for just a couple of mpg I will take the power any day</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Amazing power, this little car is fast, and you have to drive it. With the 5 speed manual I feel 18 again. The gas mileage is pretty amazing, sound system that comes with is excellent even w/o the sync. Plug in the i-pod and roll on. Outside noise is really cut, it is a music pod for sure.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 2008 SES ford Focus is the best. The only thing I did not get was the leather seats. The car is great on gas. I am getting 27 mile a gallon around town and 32 highway can't complain about that with today's gas prices. I tested many other cars but keep coming back to the Focus. It's got the get up and go I was looking for. Would tell anyone looking to buy "it's a great car". Thank you Ford.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Like everyone else, gas prices pushed me towards an econmical vehicle. I drove the Honda Fit, Hyundai Accent and Chevy Cobalt. For the what you get for the money, Focus wins easily. I have the Automatic SES. The suspension on this car makes it fun to drive. It doesn't lean much through the turns and provides a comfortable ride. I'm still on my first tank of gas and the computer is reporting 35mpg of mixed driving! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've put about 1,000 miles on my '08 Focus and I've loved everyone. When I purchased this car I was also looking at a Nissan Sentra Spec-V, a Mazda3, a Chevy Colbalt, a Toyota Corolla and a Dodge Caliber R/T. Although some of the vehicles had more hp and some were dressed a little nicer none of them had better fuel milage, a better price tag, or an overall total package like the Focus. If you're in the market for a fun, zippy, nice looking, little sports car then look no further than the 2 door Focus SES. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the Ford Focus 4 door se sedan. I have to say Wow. I have parked my 2500 Dodge Ram that cost $280 a week to fill. I am getting 41.9 miles to the gal. driving 35 miles each way to work and home. I simply wanted a throw away car with decent mileage. I called the dealership had them fax me a price over and bought it with out test driving or looking at it. when I went to pick it up I was totaly surprised I did not know they had redone the car. I have the vapor siver color and black interior. First thing I did was had the windows tinted all but the front and the car looks awsome. I removed the Focus and dealer sticker off the back.

<TEXT>This is a great little car. I never really considered a Ford Focus, but with gas prices going up and up, I decided to test drive one and loved it. I got a black 2 door coupe SES with black cloth and everything besides a roof. The interior design is very nice for a $17,000 car. The white gauges with indigo blue looks nice at night. The car handles very well and the dash is set up nicely. I currently have about 500 miles on the car and am averaging about 26 mpg with mostly city driving, it should get better when the car is broken in more.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fresh new look. Drives and handles like a more expensive car. Gas mileage is great and interior is nicely redone. Sync is very cool. Car is a blast to own, best bang for the buck by far!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my new Focus. The ride is smooth and the leather smells heavenly every morning. After leaving a mid-size SUV I was afraid of missing the power and room but the Focus has ample power and tons of front leg room for me to reach out with my long legs. The trunk is very large and holds more than enough shopping and luggage for most. The back seat is small and would be good for small children. I am usually the only one in the car but the kids fit just fine when we get out together. I am thrilled with the 5 options for music. USB,MPG or I-pod, radio, 6 CD changer, and the best, Sirius. The car looks better tinted and I recommend purchasing aftermarket door edge gaurds. Happy trails!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the music options, Sync, leather, heated seats and sunroof. The AC is awesome and will blow you away. Gas is so much cheaper to buy. I get 30 MPG and it's not broke in good yet. I look forward to 33 MPG soon. I spend $40 at the pump every 11 days instead of $75 every 10.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car after I put $120 of gas in my truck and said enough is enough. The car has met all my expectations that I had for the small car. I'm 6'2" and I recently took a day trip and it wasn't bad but I believe it wasn't built for me. I paid $13,650 drive out with no trade-in. I believe buying cars at the end of the month is best. This is my sixth new Ford I have purchased since 1976 and I will continue to by their products. I have checked two tanks fulls of gas for mpg and I have gotten over 33 mpg from both tanks. It's probably 75% highway and 25% around town.</TEXT>

<TEXT>OK for one my family has owned Fords for a long time and I think they are some of the best cars made. I test drove 15 cars before I test drove my Ford Focus and I fell in love. I do have some stuff to say. The head liner isn't cheap it is a safety thing the side airbags come out of the whole top so thats why it looks cheap. Next the side vents to do stuff if you set them right they help remist/defog ur window and also its ment to blow on your arm not face that's what the two center one is for. Some bad things about the car are minor though there is no trunk release inside the car and the trunk liner does not stick to the floor if you put and heavy items in it over all the car is great</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven SUV's for the past 9 years. With the rising prices of gas I thought i'd entertain the idea of a car. The 2008 Focus looks good and gets awesome gas mileage. I originally looked at the SE model with ABS and traction control. My local dealer showed me that the SES is the same price after adding options to an SE. SYNC is incredible.

<TEXT>This car looks good. It's a five speed which is fun to drive. I've always driven an automatic. The cruise works great. Handling is good. I've only got about 300 miles on the car and I get about 23-25mpg city and in town mixed w/air on. Mileage probably get better when it gets broken in better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks great for an economy car. Feels sporty since it's two door five speed. On trips it will get better mileage since most miles will be on highway. But 23-25 in town is not too bad considering I use the a/c all the time. </FAVORITE>

Against wind, 70 mph: 35.6 mpg. No wind, 80 mph: 29.8 mpg. No wind, 60 mph: 37.1. Look, it's not a glamorous car but I got the leather seats and are they worth it. I went from a Suburban to the Focus. Wow. I love a 10 gallon fill. Hats off to Ford for building a great little car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It lacks the ergonomic perfection of the Civic, the driving dynamics of the 3, and the eternity and a half warranty of the Elantra, yet the Focus brings to the compact table a truly unique set of attributes.It has an amazing set of features (bluetooth, usb, sirius etc), great steering, mid-size ride comfort, a vault like chassis, and admirable fuel economy. On the debit side, the taller than average ride height limits its toss-ability through curves, and the interior could use fewer expanses of silver plastic. All told, with the benefit of 3500 in factory incentives, the Focus presents an overall value and feature set unique to the market. Thumbs up Ford. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a SES model with auto and sirius red with black interior. I did my research and if you compare to Fit, Yaris, Aveo it is better deal with the standard options it has including the rebate. Some magazines pick on the headrests (who cares) optional blue lighting (can't find one) and grab bars (who cares I am driving and have steering wheel). I have SYNC with satellite and the hands free phone and music is great! So far getting about 31 mpg with mixed city/highway driving according to computer. Focus is much improved from 2007 model like brakes,6 air bags,engine, MPG, SYNC, TPM system and fit and finish. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the 2008 Focus for the price and gas mileage. I am still on first tank and the mpg keeps climing. Can I believe this? Sometimes for long stretches it says I am at 55MPG. Usually goes to 43 or so. Only when I am going slow or accelerating fast does it drop. Could this be true? I have driven it 3 days now and my gas gauge as barely budged! Other than that the car is OK nothing exciting. Black window trim came loose before I got it home. I had to snap it back in myself!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Going into my new car search I was almost certain I was going to get a Chevy Cobalt. I decided to test drive the Focus just so that I could get a quote and use that to lower the price of a Cobalt when I visited the Chevy dealer. But as soon as I began to test out the SYNC system I fell in love. That thing works so well I am blown away by it. Not much room in the back for passengers, but that's to be expected. All in all, assuming it stays reliable, I'd say this is an incredible car with a great price </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SYNC voice recognition system! Just incredibly awesome! 90-95% accuracy (and I have a slight speech impedement too!) I think the speakers sound great despite what I have read on some forums. The bass is incredible, way better than any $75 aftermarket speakers I've bought for my previous car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in our Ford Taurus for the new Focus. I love how easy the car is to drive and you can't beat the price. I got the car loaded and just love all the features. I owned a 2000 Focus and had just traded it in for a Caravan. Never had any real trouble with that one except for all the recalls, but they fixed everything at no cost. This car rides smooth even over the bumpiest roads, the sound system is great and the gas mileage is incredible. Very quiet car, lots of interior room and a huge trunk. Highly recommend.</TEXT>

<TEXT>One word sums up my Focus, surprised! I was set on not buying a Ford. Reading the reviews my heart was on a Corolla, Civic or Mazda 3. However after all my research and actually test-driving I can honestly say I'm very impressed w/ my Focus. Quiet, great handling, good mileage and solid. Power isn't impressive, but more then adequate (if you're looking for power get out of this car class). Lots of car for the money!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Let me start off by saying I had a 2007 Ford Focus and put 23,000 miles on it and thought it was a great car. Then the 2008 Focus came out, test drove it and it was mine. This car drives very well, and a noticeable difference from 07 to 08 in both performance and handling. You also sit high up in the seat, and have great viewing angles. Another noticeable difference in the 08 is that its very quiet. Highway speeds of about 70-75 the car has barley any road noise. All in all this car feels like a much more expensive car when driving and looks really great too. I would definitely recommend a test drive!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync - simply amazing and works great(surprising as its made by Microsoft) Like the design of the interior/exterior, much more modern that previous years and car actually has character unlike some of the other small sedans. Ambient lighting is pretty cool, unnecessary of course, but still cool. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I compared the Civic, Corolla and the Focus. Drove all three and the Ford was quieter, more comfortable and offered more standard features for less price. it was the only car that offered traction control, and ABS brakes. The new body style, though not as sleek as the Civic nor refined as the Corolla was a great improvement over the 07 model and that it was the deciding factor. I would have paid 3K more of the Honda or Toyota. The sync is neat (I don't own an ipod yet) but the bluetooth is a true safety feature. I trade the cheap compressor and bottle of green slime for a spacesaver spare since my last three blowouts were on the sidewall and no slime will fix that!</TEXT>

<TEXT>SE Sedan 5-speed M. with ABS and Speed Control. My wife and I seriously considered the Civic and Mazda3...but then opted for the Focus at $4000 less. We tested vehicles at all levels (S/SE/SES), 2 & 4 doors and both transmissions. We selected the 5-speed SE due to the options plus the 5-speed really performs the best (it gets this light vehicle up to speed, very quickly and smoothly). It is what it is - a simple, $16,000 compact that is loaded with features, quiet, comfortable, that handles and performs well and is very fuel efficient. 32 MPG in city and 48 MPH on the highway (with cruise on) per our on-board computer. The vehicle has tight panel seams and great build quality. And fun!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent fuel economy. Very quiet interior cabin. Great handling. Fun to drive. Quality 5-speed manual transmission (German Built) On-board computer providing MPG data. Comfortable seating. Fold down rear seats. Powerful 2.0 16 valve engine (Mazda engineered). Excellent interior lighting</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have the SE model with automatic antilock brakes traction control and upgraded 6cd sound system. Color is silver vapor metallic with charcoal interior. This car is built like a bank vault no squeaks or rattles and is according to the computer getting 35.4 miles per gallon on the first tank of fuel. This new model is much quieter and rides better than the previous year, overall a much improved vehicle. I did a lot of research before buying my new car and I would like to suggest if you are in the market for fuel efficient car that you give one a test drive. I think you will surprised by the new Focus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is fantastic. I purchased this car on 04/26/2008 and I absolutely love it. The Sync system is absolutely a must. I asked if the Sync model could be installed after the fact and they stated no that it was a factory install so for the extra $400 I got a Focus that had it. The fuel mileage is incredible, I am getting about 30 miles to the gallon city, and 35 miles to the gallon highway. The Focus handles great at highway speeds and in town around corners. I traded in a gas hogging 2007 Ford Escape XLT and I am so glad I did.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 9 years of selling fords I finally bought one for myself to drive to work everyday. My wife has 2 of our products, the oppurtunity has just not come around for me. This car blows me away in quality, quietness, and value. I love the manual tranny. It is twice the car I expected it to be. Very low maintenance. Pay attention to the lack of timing belt. I bought a base car because I dont need the frills. A huge improvement over the prior model, although those have been very very good since 2005.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I think this car has more going for it than any compact car out there. The drivers seat is very comfortable and for the first time in my life I have a new car with no rattles or squeeks. The handling is great, passive rear wheel steering is obviously designed into this vehicle rear suspension giving it cornering ability and traction that I have only experienced in more expensive cars. The engine is very quiet at any speed and accelerates with vigor although passing can be a little taxing on the 2.0. Transmission shifts are perfect with no hunting between gears. Sync, all I can say is that Ford and Microsoft, two companies that sometimes deservingly get a hard time from consumers have a hit! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quality, this car has an incredible feel to it, everything seems tight. Sync, this is the best feature in any car on the road today. I was looking for a manual tranny but for deal making reasons with my salesman I ended up with an auto. I really like the smooth shifts, their calibration is spot on. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car about three weeks ago and so far I am very impressed. The Focus is a very responsive, quiet, comfortable and fun to drive car. I test drove a Nissan Sentra 2.0 and a Toyota Corolla Ce and neither were as good as the Focus. It is a small car so obviously fuel economy is great. I am an 18 year old car enthusiast and can tell you that this car is a lot of bang for the buck. I have also noticed that the quality of the interior compared to my buddy's old Focus is much improved. I highly recommend this car to any young buyer who is looking for a fun and affordable small car</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I test drove my Focus I was surprised at how well it drove. It accelerates well and the automatic transmission is one of the smoothest I've ever felt. I drove a Mazda 3 automatic and the downshift was quite abrupt. The Focus downshift is controlled and smooth. Also, this car handles curves excellently. You can keep pushing the throttle on a curve and the car stays on it without body roll. Because of the performance, options and rebate I think it was a good purchase. If you are looking for an inexpensive, fuel efficient, zippy and solid vehicle I recommend this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My family always bought Fords until the mid 1980s. Then as we noticed quality was falling we migrated to Hondas and we do still like them. That said we did much research on acquiring a new small comfortable fuel efficient car. We looked at Honda, Toyota, Nissan, etc. The Ford Focus stood out and I have to admit I am really happy. I never understood how we Americans could not build a car as good as the Germans or Japanese. The Sync system is fantastic and promotes safety. Fuel economy is great and the car seems well built. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned this car since 1/1 and had nothing but problems with the front suspension. This car has very weak front springs especially the right side bottoms out with every bump in the road, inclined driveways forget about it. The front underside has taken a beating with such a weak suspension. Has been in the shop numerous times but to no avail(so far). Dealership has replaced front strut, aligned it and reposition a strut also to rid itself of a loud popping noise on the left front side. Will go back in the shop next week. Springs are so weak I can compress them with a single hand Fuel mileage I find above average, great dash and readouts, comfortable seats(do not spill on them).</TEXT>

<TEXT>WRT fuel efficiency: On my 3rd tank averaged 39mpg ( by miles/gallons to refill) on mostly town/rural roads. Best trip was about 40 miles distance, 2/3 of it on Interstate 95, getting 45mpg. Understand, I drive very conservatively, trying to keep tach below 2k. On the interstate it's 55- 62 mph. I watch the average mpg very carefully, resetting on each trip to maintain sensitivity to moment to moment driving behaviors. Accelerate very gradually. As warm weather comes in, mpg has improved on the shorter trips. If I am in the least bit of a hurry, gas efficiency drops 20% - without fail. BTW, I have the automatic transmission.</TEXT>

I'm not a little person 300 lbs. 6 ft. (maybe a little round; 61 don't bend like I used to) I don't fit in many small cars, that's why I had an Explorer. We stopped to check out the Focus wow! I had no Idea! It's roomy, very classy, leather, has power, great price, lots of extras, and looks great! It has cut my gas bill in half! Mileage around town 31.5MPG! 35 to 37MPG on the hiway!

<TEXT>We recently had to buy a new car for my wife to drive to work - about 50 miles per day, round trip. Due to Ford incentives I saved $2500 off sticker I paid $13,733 for an S version with automatic, ABS with traction control and, if you can believe this, a spare tire ($60.00). The sticker was $16,255. One savings was a $1000 "Conquest Rebate". That's given to people who own cars from competing brands. We own an 06 Corolla so we got it. Toyota had basically no incentives and a comparably equipped Corolla was going to cost me more like $15,900. A comparably equipped Civic was going to cost more than the Corolla. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>High seating position for driver and passenger - giving more leg room. Excellent performance. Performance is better than our Corolla, and the car is more comfortable than a Civic. No back seat headrests which obscure the rear view in our Corolla - a lot.</FAVORITE>

Gas mileage has been improving since I bought the car (with only 42 miles on it.) It's up to an average of 25 mpg. Features and add ons are fun. Audiophile sound system sounds sweet and precise. Ambient lights add a little extra to the somewhat bland interior. I love the moonroof. Also, back seats are extremely roomy and comforable for a small coupe.

<TEXT>After 2500 miles,this car is in the top 5 of cars I have owned. I have owned dozens. Surprisingly quick and agile. Factory specs say 0-60 in 8 seconds. That is not bad acceleration for getting about town and into traffic. The car will exceed the posted speed limits anywhere I have driven on mountain highways in Colorado. Drivers seat and driving position is very comfortable (I am 6'2"), although my 5'5" female passenger seat occupant thinks the center of the back of that seat is uncomfortable. I didn't get the bluetooth/synch option but the auxiliary input jack is very handy for portable audio and XM users</TEXT>

It's much better then most of the imports in its price range and better equipped. I have not driven a car on a regular basis for more than 15 years, it reminds me of my 6 cylinder Mustang (1965) but with pick- up and way better handling. 30 mpg so far in mix of highway and city driving and no trouble keeping up with traffic or passing at 70 mph.

<TEXT>I love this car. The concern I had about power vanished on the drive home when it easily went up the long steep hills coming into town. Merging into high-speed interstate traffic is a breeze. It's full of pep and handles great. Fun to drive. It shifts quietly. The seats sit high, unlike my previous car where I felt as if I were sitting in a hole. After only 600 miles, I'm getting about 29 MPG, and it continues to rise. The interior lights at night are well designed and very attractive. I love the functions on the odometer, such as estimated miles to empty & estimated MPG. The car is very pretty, from the pin stripes on the side to the chrome inserts on front panel. It's a great little car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seat is high enough to slide in and out without bending down. It has a huge trunk. Interior lights at night are soothing.

The Avalon was in for rattles twice and still had rattles, and it was in the shop for several days over 2 visits with oxygen sensor issues. Now I'm saving money on gas, insurance, and I actually like my car again. Nice ride, fun to drive, and great stereo.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Handling, gas mileage, ease of oil changes (oil filter and drain are directly under the engine so oil goes right in the drain pan). The 100,000 service intervals (chain cam drive, not expensive to replace belts) are nice. A very quiet stable ride, excellent engine noises (revs well and sounds good doing it) and generally pleasing looks inside and out won us over the others cars we reviewed. The five-speed transmission gets good marks and surprisingly, the auto version feels spritly, too. With the highest torque (136 ft-LB) at the lowest RPM (4250RPM) and almost the highest HP (140) at the lowest RPM (6000RPM) this engine matches to an auto better than the rest, too. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the driving dynamics of this car. It is a great blend of sport and luxury for such a small car. The Focus premium sound is great compared to the others. Ford uses the Sirius satellite for supposedly better sound quality over XM. Can anybody out there tell the difference?</FAVORITE>

The handling, the style, the comfort, have made it a complete package worthy of calling it a Ford. Old Henry Ford would be proud of it. I've had nothing but praises by peple that have rode in it and those that look at it. I'm proud of what our American car companies can do when they set thier minds to it. Ford is really focused on building a quality product. Keep up the good work. I love my car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>From the smooth quite ride, to the surprisingly athletic styling, to the exceptional power the Ford Focus does everything right. I was concerned with downgrading the size and power of my engine, so much so that I initially never thought of looking at the Focus. But the test drive up one of the steepest hills in my area proved that the power and acceleration I would need was present. Ford is years ahead of Honda with this car. SYNC is absolutely amazing and will be a major "deal breaker" in all future car purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I only had this car for a little while but I can tell you it is right up there with the the Japanese brands. The retuned suspension is great, the ride is smooth,the interior is quiet except for a little road noise which is expected in a compact car. It handles great. Fuel economy is pretty good also. I would recommend this car over the Toyota Corolla. I test drove the Corolla and it had much more road noise and a ride that isn't as smooth as the Focus. I would highly recommend this car to anybody.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought the Focus SES 4 Door, I love this car. I am a late 30's something female, and my 15 year old thinks this is the coolest car. I have had my share of muscle cars (Mustang Gt, Chevy Corvette), but I tell you this, dollar for dollar nothing beats this car. The handling is tight, the pep at take off is impressive. Like some of the other reviews, I too get looks like "what is that car". To make the ride fun get it tricked out!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car totally rocks. For less then 18k I have Bluetooth for the phone and the best voice recognition system on the market. The USB port that takes darn-near every media player- without a special cable (you use your normal USB)is outstanding. It even plays songs off of a thumbdrive if you dont have a Zune or ipod! It is very snappy around town, and fine on the highway- the seats are very high and the headroom is remarkable. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SYNC! You have to experence it to appreciate it. Takes 2 or 3 drives before you get the hang of it (talking to your car is strange at first) but when you get used to it-- awesome! Also the leather seats are really soft and comfy, the suspension is super comfortable. Super quiet inside! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drive 30 miles each way to work and needed a fuel efficient car. The Focus is a pleasure to drive. The driver's seat is very comfortable and the only comfort I would wish for is a telescoping steering wheel. After 4 tanks of gas I am getting 31.2 mpg in mixed driving which is about 60 percent highway. Handling is delightful with responsive steering and agile cornering. I got the SYNC system and boy am I pleased. Nothing like a USB port in the dash that allows you can plug an 8 gig memory stick full of music. Between the memory stick, Sirius Radio and CD stacker I will never suffer for lack of entertainment. So far no defects or immediate fix items. Very happy Focus owner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm getting 38.8 ave mpg! Wow this is more than I had hoped for. The car is quiet and has a nice ride but its not a town car by no means. All the features are easy to use. Cruise works better going up hill than down on my 5 speed, it let it get about 5 mph faster down hill. We got a small amount of snow yesterday but it wasn't enough to test the traction control. The heater heats up quickly and has it very hot inside the car in about 20 minutes. The ABS stops the car quickly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Some may think I "downgraded" to the Focus from my fully-loaded 2005 Five Hundred Limited, but I love this car like no other. It handles like a sportscar, the mileage is fantastic (I commute 450 mi./week), and it's just fun! I took 4 friends shopping this weekend and while it was a bit of a tight fit in the backseat, we were fairly comfortable and the trunk was large enough for all our purchases. My husband can't wait for me to get sick of it so he can drive it more often; that won't happen any time soon! I would recommend the Focus to anyone looking for an economical, sporty little car. For all the features at these prices (not to mention the current incentives), you can't go wrong.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SYNC, fog lamps, new exterior and interior styling, fuel economy, and handling. The automatic transmission is powerful for a 4 cylinder and responds well to my lead foot. The amorous, borderline-jealous looks and compliments I've been getting are a nice feature, as well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First let me say, this car looks good, inside and out. The engine is very zippy, the shifting is very smooth (I have the automatic), interior is quiet, seats comfy, steering is responsive, steering wheel is great, and dash layout is clean. Interior is not bland in my version.I love that there are no cubby holes in the dash and everything is smooth and metallic looking. This translates to no dust or dirt getting stuck in corners, on buttons, or dark spaces which is a plus I believe. Radio gets bad reception? Not mine, I have satellite radio that came with it, and yes.. the same small radio antennae. Maybe you should check wattage on radio stations you choose, mine picks up radio from France.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tilt steer & steering , digital read gas mileage, satillite radio, interior and exterior design, mp3, the low price, the comfy seats (who needs headrests in the backseats?

<TEXT>I swore off small cars for 25 years after driving a Ford Escort in the 80's. I went back after gas prices went up to $3/gallon. After driving a Focus for 2 weeks I discovered this car is a lot of fun to drive. Handling is great, performance good and exhaust is tuned to sound "throaty" when accelerating. SYNC feature, heated leather seats and ambient lighting enhance the experience. After driving a small suv that averaged 16 mpg, filling up the Focus is a lot easier on my wallet. I normally drive 125 miles per week. After the first 2 weeks, I am up to 500 miles because I enjoy the ride so much.</TEXT>

This being on mine it didnt come standard with tilt even thought mentioned in owners manual And also it did not come with the silver emblems on the outside as ever other Focus did. But as for the rest of the car the inside flows very very well and the outside looks very sharp. And still has some horsepower to boot.</TEXT>

I have the Audiophile system and music sounds awesome with the built in Subwoofer. Ambient lighting is great as well. Do yourself a favor.

<TEXT> I traded in my 1999 Chevy Blazer, it was a big change going to a Focus, but I wanted a new car that didn't want to stop at every gas station ! Handles very nice & has great pick up speed. I've only had it 1 week & already put 300 miles on it. One thing I didn't notice until it was too late is there is no interior light for the back seat. I have a toddler & it's pretty dark in the mornings when I leave for work & dark once again when I get home, so it's hard to see to get him in & out, but it's something we'll have to deal with.

<TEXT>This little car is more than what I expected for the cost. I would have to say it moves nicely and does not have any issues getting around for a little 2.0 liter. I am happy to lower my payments as this is a great car for the money, I would choose it over a Honda civic any day of the week. Our other car is a 06? Honda Accord and the Focus is quieter than my fully loaded V6 Accord. The interior is clean and well thought out as the controls with the satellite radio and sync take a little getting used to. I will have to say that ?The Sync is far superior to the i-control of the BMW 5 series and the Honda Accord that I own.? This is a gas saver and a great commuter car and garage others </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is my company car. It has ABS and traction control, as well as Sync. The radio is disappointing - It fades in and out, like the digital receiver isn't always picking up those Fm stations clearly. No static, just high quality sound to all of a sudden poor quality sound. The exterior is not attractive. I've heard "at least this is better than before." I disagree. I think the old Focus was quite attractive, and Ford should have totally reengineered it (i.e., the new Euro Focus) rather than reskin this one - it just isn't up to par. That being said, I love the traction control; it's very reassuring while driving in snow. The interior is functional and attractive, w/ nice lighting.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This review refers only to the base coupe S model. I bought a 2 door with a 5 speed manual transmission, so bear that in mind as you read further. Also keep in mind this is an economy car. If you want high performance look elswhere. Ford quality is way up these last many years. My base model with manual transmission has plenty of power and a nice tight suspension for a gas sipper. 2008 models have totally new exterior styling from the earlier Foci, and in my opinion are much better looking. Interior controls are simple, without silly frills. Dashboard gauge design is boring. The trunk space is huge, and the rear seats can be folded down. Incredibly quiet and solid.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>5 speed has zippy power. Nice suspension, corners very well for an economy car. Superbly smooth, positive shifting manual transmission. Revs at only 2350 rpm in 5th gear at 60 mph. I wouldn't hesitate to take this little car on a cross country drive. Remarkably quiet. Sips gas.</FAVORITE>

I find the exterior fresh - it makes me smile to see it in the parking lot. The interior is pleasant & modern. Quiet drive (unlike '07). SES comes with electrochromic mirror and trip calculator (mpg, mi to mt, fuel effeciency...). Brand new so reliability rating hopeful (good warranty). Definitely worth checking out!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned this car for little less than 6 months after acquiring it from a family relative. The car has treated me well so far through the later part of the winter, spring and now into summer. Gas mileage is decent, comfort is excellent, highway noise is minimal, drivetrain noise is minimal. I have an automatic which shifts smoothly for the most part but is jerky when under hard quick acceleration. The car is unfortunately terribly slow (even compared to my 94 VW GTI 2.0l). It keeps me out of trouble though. Handling is pretty good for stock suspension. And lastly the interior build is decent, the seats could use more support and better materials.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Focus in June of '08, after driving a gas guzzling minivan for 5 years. After looking at Toyotas, Hondas, Chevys and Mazdas, the Focus was just the best idea for cost and reliability. I'm at 17,500 miles and have no issues. The gas mileage got up to 41mpg highway, but also as low as 27mpg city. Being a musician and a sort of music junkie, it's just amazing how seamlessly my Zune works with Sync. It's a good looking car with lots of options and features; it just gets you where you need to go - in style.</TEXT>

At 17k the car began making a loud noise from the drive train when accellerating on a freeway. Took it in for service. There is a TSB which addresses the problem.

It also has enough power to keep up with traffic whether it being with one or 5 passengers aboard. Great car overall. The SYNC system is awesome. It's the best feature Ford ever came up with especially with a new cell phone ban while driving law that is coming to Ontario. </TEXT>

<TEXT>First, I want to thank everyone who put a review for this car online... when I was looking, I really wanted a hatch (Honda Fit). However, after driving the Fit, I was very disappointed and decided to keep looking. We drove home past a Ford dealership, and I remembered all the rave reviews of the Focus (I wanted something small for gas mileage). They had 3 Focus-es on the lot, and we test drove the SES. I absolutely loved the car - it handles better than the Fit, turns more smoothly, accelerates faster, and is very easy to drive and understand. (Sadly, no hatchback or "magic" seats - figured those were not things I'd actually use on a daily basis.) 1 year later & I still LOVE this car!</TEXT>

If my daughter ends up taking it I will have to decide on getting a second Focus.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel mileage, easy to park or manuver whereever you want to go and if you need quick acceleration it's will go. The look is very sporty and I likie the hands free blu-tooth and the music download options.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I always owned sports cars then moved into minivans as a soccer mom, the kids are grown mostly so I moved back into a sporty but economical car. Great gas mileage, good pick up speed to jump on the highway, for a smaller car you don't have to drop down on the ground to get in the car. I like the dash illumination, my only negative would be sometimes it picks up a rock and the sound enters the passenger compartment kind of loud. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car about a year ago and so far, no complaints. I originally test drove a Sentra, Civic, Corolla and a Mazda3 before buying the Focus. The Focus just felt a little more solid and very quiet on the inside. The Focus lacked pep, but after a year of driving, I think it's gotten a little quicker now that it's broken in. After a year it is still very quiet, no rattles or squeeks. I have had no problems whatsoever and I am definitely glad I purchased the Focus over the competition. It is a well built car, fun to drive, has great features, and was very inexpensive. $16,700 out the door! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync is well worth the $$$. I like my 16" wheel option and the fog lights on the SE. I also like the cavernous space under the armrest and the 5 cupholders. Larger trunk than most cars this size.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Replaced my 2005 Escape which I loved - but needed better gas mileage. Boy did I get my money's worth! I have gotten as high as 42 mpg on a long trip, and even regular commute nets anywhere from 35 mpg to 39 mpg depending on how fast highway traffic is moving. I got the 5-speed standard - it's less expensive and way more fun to drive - you can really take off in a hurry when you need to. Loved my Escape - but this little gem is really winning me over - I'd replace it with another Focus in a heartbeat when the time comes!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Almost didn't buy my Focus because they couldn't find a tow hitch to fit it, but did at the last minute. I pull a retro-looking hard side trailer filled with my possessions as I move across the country for my work (wildland firefighter). Total weight 1500 lbs and the car pulls great. Only had to downshift a couple times up the passes in CA. Sync is cool! Just hope it doesn't crash like my microsoft laptop, but so far so good. One negative is a weird gap where the trunk meets the rear quarter panel, no leaks but it may be an early assembly glitch. (I got one of the first cars of the line) My baby has been from MN to FL to CA and back to FL in this year alone, all pulling the trailer!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 125 HP engine is a major upgrade. 5 speed manual is fun to drive. Sync needs a little tweaking but still cool. Oil filter is easy to get to!!!! MPG while towing:20-25</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am thoroughly disappointed with this vehicle and the service I have/haven't received! I have already had to replace door seals, tires at 17,000 miles, have a clunking noise they "can't replicate", and it already didn't want to start at 29,000. I'm on the road for 2 hrs. 5 days a week in this vehicle and though the gas mileage is good, it's an uncomfortable ride. Hardly any leg room for riders in the back seat. Dealership never wants to work very hard to figure out what the problems are. Told them I wouldn't buy another one, and they said that's ok. Service mgr. said Focus still has a suspension problem and that's why I have a tire issue, but didn't offer to do anything about it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Focus to replace my nightmare VW Beetle. Overall I like it .I'm at 14,000 miles. It does well in all weather. I find the seats to be very comfortable. The seat backs are high, which is great because I'm on the tall side (for a female). The moonroof is nice, but cuts a lot of headroom in the backseat. The back seat is hard to get into with the coupe. SYNC is pretty neat, but hard to use sometimes. The brakes are terrible, and are very underpowered. The headlights are not very bright, and I'm probably going to put in some HIDs. I have beige cloth that I have worked very hard to keep clean, but I should have gotten leather. I get better than estimated MPG. Nice, smooth clutch.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My daughter took my Honda Civic to college. She said she had fallen in love with it during the summer and it was no use to try to pry it from her hands. I had rented a few Focuses and always enjoyed their pure simple performance. went over to Ford to look at one. Finances were tight. I ended up buying an SES 2 Dr. with all the bells and whistles. The price put the imports to shame. No, it's not a Beemer or an Audi. But I bought in on my credit card! It was half the price of the cars we had looked at. It goes very well, it can corner, and it can get up and go with that smooth 5-speed. It shines up real well, and even the Pirellis hold their own on tough surfaces. I'm happy!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great looks, very peppy, and the family like all of the plug-in gismos. It gets good mileage, and it holds lots of cargo in the trunk.

<TEXT>The automatic transmission has problems with this vehicle. Stay away from it. I bought a 2008 Focus program car last week with 11,000 miles on it. I thought it drove very nice, etc., when I test drove it. I was not really familiar with how it was to actually perform. Driving a loaner vehicle of same type 2008 Focus SE automatic transmission, I knew something was wrong with the one I purchased. I was told by the dealership nothing was wrong with the transmission, even though the engine screams at 60 mhp because it is not shifting, I was told the car would acclimate itself to me, and shift after it got used to me? Do not buy one, this transmission problem is on the net. Last Ford for me</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2001 Focus which I bought used. It had about 130,000 miles on it and I was in need of something new, with gas prices what they were I went with the SES Focus power everything is the only way to go. Best choice of a car ever, plenty of room, pepy, good on gas and gets a lot of looks. I added a few hidden emergency lights to it for my business and when I turn them on I get a lot of ooooing and ohhhhing from people. It's a very sharp vehicle for a work vehicle. Also just added a HID coversion kit for my headlights, this is a great improvement to the safety and the look of the car at night</TEXT>

I am planning to add the 2009 2door coupe rear roof spoiler and a 3d carbon body kit to it for looks. Other than that it's an excellent car that is easy to drive and I send anyone I know that is looking at a new car to go look at it and test one! The motor is not a barn burner, but will hold you at 140km/h all day and not think about it! would love to add a 6 speed (overdrive) but hey- it's a $15000 car not a $25000 one. Its handling is not a Lambo but it takes everything I toss at it and I havn't gotten it on 2 wheels yet! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SYNC. Hands free is great! The drivers seat is height adjustable too! I am 6'4 and fit with extra room! I recomend looking at the leather befor you buy it. I didn't like it but some do. I think it has a Volvo sport look thing when looking down the front side! </FAVORITE>

I took a trip to Carlsbad caverns and also to the Grand Canyon, my weekend trip was in excess of 1300 miles. My dislike: Radio has an XM button I'm unable to add XM to the radio or any of the Sync options, there is no upgrade other than going to a higher cost on the vehicle. Cruise control: Engineers this is a gas miser add cruise? No spare, yes you save weight, break down in the desert New Mexico see if you walk out.

<TEXT>I purchased my Focus S Coupe mainly for the gas mileage, as the price at the pump was over $4/gal at the time. I test drove an automatic first, then a manual, and settled on the 5-speed, as it literally left the automatic for dead at stoplights. What is more, the manual seemed to hunt between its two top gears with an annoying frequency. This is not a problem when you stir your own gears. Having owned mostly European cars, I was pleasantly surprised with the up-high seating position of the Focus. I also like the steering feel, as it lacks the numbness of so many American cars I have driven. Performance is pretty decent for a car of this type, and the engine is well behaved at all speeds.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Up high seating, excellent steering feel, well behaved engine and more than adequate headroom for my 6'-2" frame. The stock sound system is pretty good for the price, and its controls have the feel of what one would find in a much more expensive car. The trunk is downright cavernous for a coupe.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I bought this car, I was making a 74-mile round trip commute. The car has performed beautifully and more than lived up to its EPA gas mileage estimate. (I got about 40mpg driving mostly back roads and highways, even with my heavy foot.) Sales and service experiences have been great. My only complaint is that the headrests are a little uncomfortable for me; they tend to push my head forward more than is comfortable, hence the 8s in comfort and interior design. This car has been great fun to drive, and I'm glad I chose the Focus over the other models I was considering (Chevy Aveo, Honda Fit, and others in similar class.)</TEXT>

<TEXT>Nissan lover who turned to Ford! I loved my 200SX SER for many years, but needed to buy a Truck. Throughout the years, I longed for a fuel efficent, sporty, compact 2 door coupe like I once had. Out of the blue, I thought I'd take a chance on a 2007 Focus SE, and enjoyed owning it. When the 2008 Focus came out, I got excited, and I knew I had to "upgrade." The Focus is fun to drive, and it's even better with a manual tranny. I have been very happy with my purchase. I've read a lot of "Car Critics" review of the Focus, and they bash Ford at every angle minus the Sync system. Critics only like Japanese compact vehicles! For the price, you can't beat all the great features Ford offers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Early this year, I purchased an all base model 2008 Ford Focus. I drive a whole lot and need something with good mileage but also family safe since we had our first baby on the way. We drove everything in its class and spent at least a good month researching what would fit us best. I have a strong dis-taste for most Asian vehicles, but even so we test drove the Civic, Fit, Corolla, Echo, Yaris, Impreza etc etc. We ended up picking the Focus for its great value and still the best mileage overall. Rated better than the Aveo! I drive this vehicle every day and love it to death! Its great fun to drive, spacious for a little car and still smooth and powerful! Very safe too. Great job Ford!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive a manual Focus and overall it's a great car. I would pick it over the Cobalt any day. Personally Im used to trucks. Until now thats all I've driven. I switched due to the fuel prices. At first I was kind of scared because I'm not used to being so low to the ground. I was used to being up high in my F-250. Don't get me wrong I love my trucks, but I also love my car. All the air bags make you feel safe. It's a car that can definitely get up and go. Although it's a 4 cylinder it's got some power. Definitely not worried when I'm passing other cars. It seats comfortably and even when you have a full car of 5 adults it doesn't feel like your too squished. Overall I love my Focus. Definitely worth it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After being shot down by Massachusetts car dealers, I purchased my Focus SE in Salem NH. As advertised, the car had a mileage range from 29 mpg to 41mpg. Sticker average was 35 mpg. I found that the 5 speed manual transmission outperforms the 4 speed automatic. With 80% highway driving at 2500 RPM, just over 65 MPH, I average 41 mpg, easily. I once had this car performing better in the mileage catergory at 55 MPH. I actually attained 42.6 mpg. This is the reason I purchased the car. I am totally satisfied with it. It's also fun to drive. I wonder if Ford will Offer a 6 speed manual transmission in future models. </TEXT>

The dash layout is very poor and unfriendly compared to the original. My elbow is sore from wacking the console bin when I shift. No spare tire which is really unaceptable in AZ due to our weather and cell phones don't work in lots of places. The Vista Blue color is nice (best thing on car), but miss my bright Autumn Orange. Ugly hubcaps. Basic sound system is better sounder then 2000. Seat bottom not adjustable like the 2000.

<TEXT>Tested the Civic, Mazda 3, Elantra, skipped the Corolla. Was ready to go with Mazda 3 until I drove the Focus. Smooth ride, quietest of the bunch, seamless 5 speed shifter, great visibility, supportive seating, and a lot of pep. I'm actually having as much fun driving it as my '06 'stang GT 5 speed. The mileage is better than it's rated at. 4 aftermarket speakers and additional damping under dash and behind the door panels and the stock head sounds better than my Shaker 1000! Cannot hear tire hiss when driving in rain. Great, scatty little car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mileage, it stays around 35-38 MPG! Nice to fill up a 13 gal tank and see that I've got 470 mi. to empty. Cut my fuel bill in half. 5 speed shifter is seamless. Quiet! No need for stereo mods. Big trunk. No rattles or squeaks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am absolutely thrilled with the purchase of my vehicle. I had test driven many competitors vehicles ( HHR, Cobalt, Cruiser). I was not satisfied with anything until I went to Ford. I purchased a manual specically for the zip and whip. I am a Ford girl and I can not cheat on Ford, so when this stylish 2008 Focus came out (I had a 2000 Focus prior) I had to get one. This vehicle is a replica of my personality (young, always on the go and stylish). If you want a vehicle that is economical, stylish (Metallic Silver), and you can park it in the spots that bigger cars cannot; then purchase a Ford Focus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased my new Focus in red about 2 weeks ago. I absolutely love it. I use the AC all the time and don't really take it easy on the gas pedal and I still average about 37 mpg driving about 8% highway miles. It's really fun to drive and it looks really sporty which is awesome. I got the 5 speed tranny which is so smooth when shifting. With no extras I walked away paying just over $13,000 with dealer rebates. The only gripe I have so far would have to be that there is no trunk release on the inside and the S model doesn't offer keyless entry. But overall I love the car and don't regret the purchase whatsoever.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior lighting is so eye pleasing, the aux jack for my ipod, gas mileage, clock and music readouts are at eye level, and great trunk space for a coupe!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>3 months and 2000 miles and we're happy car, especially with the mileage. Very surprised by the quite ride with one exception. A noise from an unknown source developed at about 1200 miles. Dealer replaced the fuel pump, but the noise remains. Apparently Ford engineers are aware of and investigating the problem so I'm not the only one having it. No solution yet according to the dealer. I?m a little leery as we discovered a suspension problem in the first Focus we took for a test drive. It?s a nice car, but my 3 Hondas and 4 Nissans have never had problems with so few miles. If not for this unknown problem I'd be very happy with the amount of car we got for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my Focus after deciding to trade in my 2000 Jetta that had its fair share of problems over the years. My family has had several Fords and after checking out the Mazda 3, Civic, and Scion tc, this was the clear choice. It rides well, is fun to drive, and the Sync system is great. Ford was offering such great incentives that it was hard to justify not going with this car. If you're not sure, take one for a drive and you'll have a hard time saying no.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like the gas mileage, ride,and handling but at 1100 miles I noticed that when I filled the gas tank the gas guage only went to 3 quarters full! Now at 2100 miles I have a check engine light and the code states that the fuel level sensor in the gas tank is no longer working! It's a disappointment to already be having problems at such a low mileage and I wonder if this is the start of things to come!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Cant say anything at all bad about my Ford experience with regards to Focus. After owning an '01 since new with well over 100k mi and superb reliability I gladly bought a new '08 Focus and it's head and shoulders better than my beloved '01! I havent sold my '01, what does that tell ya. Great fuel mileage and comfort not to mention quite peppy even with smallest 4cyl motor choice. Great car for 1st time buyer as well as older frugal guy like me,</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned this vehicle since 10/07. Overall I enjoy the car very much. There are a few problems Ford could work on though. If you like plastic, you will love the interior. Ford could have made the interior a little less spartan by even just using softer plastic parts in some places. Another issue is the Max AC setting. You can turn the AC on by pressing the AC or Max button but once the Max air is on, the AC can only be turned off by pressing the Max button again (to turn it off) and then the AC button. There is also little storage space in the vehicle. It's very roomy and fun to drive. I have no issued with the power. It's a small V4 and gets great mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our Focus after months of shopping. We finally decide to go and test drive the Focus. To our surprise we loved it. It is a very comfortable car, has a great drive, and is even a little bit sporty. I love the dash board and the lights, the ride is very smooth. The gas mileage is great we have been getting 33-34 mpg. This is around town, but we are driving conservatively. Great car for the money, glad we made this purchase, I highly recommend this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a 4 door Focus SES automatic 4 months ago and love it! It gets excellent mileage, 40+ mpg hwy, is sporty, comfortable, quiet, and attractive. The dash is laid out well with many features found in luxury cars. My SUV now stays parked save for boat towing and family vacations, the Focus fulfills lengthy business travel and around town errands using much less gas. It has more features for less money than the Accord or Corolla. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Focus is much better built than Nissan Sentra and Toyota Corolla. I own a 2007 Sentra and had 2007 Corolla. The Focus is built much more solid and safer without the cheap plastic parts. Gas mpg is at 32 on the electronic odometer. Car handles very good on the curves and open road. I am 6'4" and fit comfortably. Since I have owned all 3 of the top compact cars, the Focus wins hands down in all categories except size. The Sentra fits me a little better. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>There is no compromise for safety and I feel that the solid Focus is built with the highest standards and workmanship to keep me and my family safe. Sirius radio is very good with improved sound upgrade. Nice European body style</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded for my Focus 4 weeks ago. I test drove both the Focus and a used Corolla. The SE Focus had a more modern interior and with the Sync System beat the Toyota S-Type hands down. The Focus lacked the accelleration of the Toyota, but the new Focus with sunroof, spoiler, Sirius and Sync was $2K less. I took the Focus on a 1600 mile business trip and am only more pleased. I am a conservative driver, but I still maintian 65 to 70 MPH highway speeds. My average fuel econony for the trip was 36 MPG even burning 10% ethanol for half the trip. Commuting nets >32MPG. Trunk space was ample and you have the option of dropping the rear seats if needed. Looks are fine. In summary, I love my Focus!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy, you'd have to step up to a hybrid for much better. Sync and Sirius radio. Good visibility and access is easy through the doors. The roofline is higher than my Infiniti. sedan. Performace has improved as break-in has completed. Engine maintenance access is good for a modern car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drive the 2008 SES, my parents got it for me for high school graduation and I love this car. I'm coming from a 96 Cobra SVT and I miss the power but the Focus greatly makes up for it. I love the voice activated items like the phone, mp3, and sync. I also like the mood lighting and awesome sound system with the big bass in the trunk (yes it is stock!) The gas is also great. I drive 60 miles a day to and from work and this car is so comfortable and performs with ease and is surprisingly peppy. Overall I think Ford did an awesome job on this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first car was a 2008 Ford Focus, 4 door with manual locks and windows. I'm a college student and on my way up to school I was in a serious accident. The car flipped three times across the median. This car saved my life. The airbags did not burn me and set off properly, the cut fuel button came in handy and the structure held preventing my legs to be crushed. I walked away with only cuts and bruises! The car was totaled, but now I'm a proud owner of a silver 2008 Ford Focus SE! </TEXT>

At first I thought I would regret it because of the difference in space, but my son loves it (especially the moon roof) and I love driving it. It is so comfortable inside, the seats are soft and the material is like no other I have been in. The interior dash and lights are great blue! I can't say enough about this car!

<TEXT>I haven't had the car very long but it's an incredibly impressive car for the price. I have a 5 speed SES. The gas mileage has always been over 32 mixed no matter what. The manual is easy to drive and kind of fun. Love the dash and layout. It's very responsive and easy/fun to drive. Good comfortable ride, handles nicely. It's an all around great car for the money and they've proven themselves to be reliable. Very happy. Ambient lighting is nice and power moonroof is not cheap. Nice attention to safety. Great wheel and driver controls.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync is awesome. I use an 8 GB thumb drive, it works great. Phone is in the pocket the whole time. Sound system is pretty good. Interior lighting, nice wheels and spoiler. Sharp little car with lots of fun toys for less than a base Civic or Corolla.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my new Focus Se for 16 days now and I can truly say that I am impressed. I am driving 108 miles per day and I drive about 70% highway and 30% city. I am getting 32.7 MPG average. The car is very smooth and peppy while being comortable as well. I had a Mitsubishi Galant LS V6 and would definitely not go back. I have to say that Ford has really done a great job with this car. I would highly recommend that anyone looking to get a very nice car with lots of bells and whistles should seriously consider this. It beats out its competition without breaking a sweat by giving the buyer more features for less money. Gas mileage is great and the ride beats the Civic and Corolla.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Like 90% of you out there, I bought this car for fuel economy. I also own a 2005 Tahoe. I love my Tahoe but it was costing me approx. $90 a week to fill up. $360 a month. so I elected to get the no thrill S model. I test drove the Cobalt and was not impressed. The Focus, on the other hand, was a real surprise. The smoothness of the powertrain and comfort are amazing. I got the bare bones version, so I can't comment on it's other attributes. i.e. synk, bluetooth etc. Handling and braking is very good, style is OK and interior design is very good. The most important feature is the 34+ mpg's I get over all. It bothers me that it hasn't gotten a better press review. It deserves much better. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage! Seats! The air conditioning is awsome! The trunk space is very large, i-Pod jack, powertrain, quiet interior, smooth suspension and the overall fit and finish is very aero-dynamic. Which probably attributes to the fantastic gas mileage. All this for $13,600 out the door.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Focus. I have always purchased Ford products, but this car is awesome. The car handles great and it drives like a little tank in bad weather, better than my Escort! It has excellent fuel economy at 34.8 miles to a gallon city driving and over 35 highway-with the price of gas at $4 a gallon and rising the Focus really helps me out financially. The interior is sweet with visible gauges. It's comfortable too! Everyone who rides in it loves it and say they will make it their next car. Ford has really improved an already good vehicle. I love driving my car, it looks, feels and rides great! It's small but has roomy interior, as well as excellent safety features!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Excellent buy. Plenty of front seat leg room, engine peppy and 37+ mpg on highway (44mpg for one stretch). Solid/comfortable seats, interior very quiet. I wanted a Mustang, but I am very happy with the Focus and it is $13,000 cheaper. I have driven it at sea level and 10,000 ft., it handled just fine. No complaints! The transmission gearings are spaced just right to help keep RPMs down, shifting is easy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I found the manual transmission will keep your speed constant on a downhill grade, similar to an engine brake. No need to ride the brakes, just leave it in 2nd or 3rd or 4th gear (your choice based on steepness of grade) and the tranny does the rest. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Before I purchased this vehicle, I read many articles, reviews and test drove it for a week at a Hertz rental agent so that I could really feel what it is like to own one. Now I have bought this car the fun never seems to stop. The car performs very well and can be economical depending on your driving habits. You can have all of its 140 hp at your disposal or drive and take it easy to get that 30+ MPG your pocket craves for. What surprises me is that no matter how I drive this car, I can get a good range of 20-30 MPG's anyway. The brakes are quiet and predictable. The suspension is excellent for its class.

<TEXT>I knew exactly what I wanted when I ordered mine. After a brief comparison of similar vehicles on the web, I found that there are no other vehicles in its class or price range that can be equipped with so many options. I have an SE with about every option you can put on it, this means it is nicer and cheaper than an SES. I didn't buy the car for it's looks, but now that I have tinted the window and added molded mud flaps, it is a darn good looking car. Gray of course makes the car, especially when considering that color is not available for an SES. Basically, anyone who wants a nice focus, don't go for the SES because the same features standard on that model are more expensive. I am so happy!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SYNC by far! I love that I was able to load every option available onto the middle trim level SE. This gave me the color I wanted which isn't available on the SES and I didn't have to pay for the spoiler which I didn't want.
