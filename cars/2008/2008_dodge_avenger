<TEXT>This car is leased. It is the R/T FWD. It is not a quick sporty vehicle, it is a borderline luxury car. Think Lincoln MKZ, but cheaper. It is great on the highway, very comfortable and quiet, but that is not what I was in the market for. It is white and the exterior styling is great. I went from a Contour SVT to this and this car is soft compared to the SVT. The climate control went out and was replaced under warranty. Overall not a bad car, just not what I wanted.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I fell in love with this car. Big mistake! I had a oil leak with 3-6 months after I purchased the car. It took 3 trips to service dept. to finally fix it.One recall done for latches in door. Shifter broke and front rotors have already had to be turned. Now they are saying back rotors need to be turned also.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ever heard "GORGEOUS ON THE OUTSIDE, HORRIBLE ON THE INSIDE". That's the perfect description for the Dodge Avenger! I bought my vehicle 10 months ago. I'm very disappointed - the vehicle is unreliable and the performance is poor. So far it's been to the shop twice! First the shifter got stuck on park. I had to pay to tow and replace the entire shifter assembly. Second, the car made squeaky noices when I moved the steering wheel. I had to take it back to the dealer for repairing...Now, I'm hearing a rattling noise in the engine...I can't wait to get rid of it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a used 2008 Dodge Avenger a few weeks ago. I went with this car because it looked way better than a Camry, Accord and all those other cars that look all alike. It drives good and my 2.7 V6 is pretty quick. I recommend going with the V6 model over the 4 banger. I drove both versions of the Avenger and the difference is like night and day. Interior is somewhat bland and the door panels are very hard to clean. There is one huge blind spot in this vehicle that I will have to get used to pretty quick. The 17" tires are perfect for the potholes I have to put up with where I live. This is my first Dodge and their styling right now is above and beyond everyone elses. </TEXT>

<TEXT>What a great drive. I traded in my 2004 jeep liberty renegade for something that gets better gas mileage and I was not disappointed. I get 32+ miles on the highways and 28+ city. The 2.7V6 gives me lots of passing power and the stain repellent seats are worth their weight in gold. I tell everyone I talk to that the Japanese cars have got nothing on this!!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a 02 Taures ses for my Avenger. The Taures had better speed and was much more comfortable. The look of the Avenger from the front is awesome!! From the back not so much. I am having problems with my Rpms going up by itself. Yesterday while in park in my driveway my Rpms shot up to 4 all on its own, I had to shut it off and that stopped it. My windows squeek if rolled all the way down and the steerling feels off. I am going to have it looked at Wednesday I hope the can diagnose the problems and fix it asap. For a new car I did not expect all the problems I am having.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the exterior look and the car handles well. I'm a little disappointed with the amount of recalls (3) so far and the radiator sprung a leak at the seam for no apperant reason. Luckly it was still under warranttee. The only other thing that concerns me is the erratic transmition shifting when the engine is cold. The ride is comfortable and I get comments on the sleek exterior. Pick up is good, and it gets good gas mileage. Not the car to work on in your back yard though, the battery is located under the left wheel well cover and nothing looks easy to work on under the hood,...water pump, alternater, A/C. etc. are all buried. I will probobly pay it off and sell it, three years from now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had 3 used cars and for this being my first brand new car, I love it. I wanted the big Charger but the price was a little high so I settled for the little brother. No complaints though. This car looks tough and has the power and style to back it up. The 3.5 liter V-6 is impressive. It?s no race car but it moves. It has 240 hp from the factory vs. Ford?s Mustang V- 6 210 hp. Any questions? The ride is unbelievable. My grandfather has a Cadillac and he feels the avenger rides better. Nice car good price get one! I would have like the navigation system but just too much. Would recommend to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a stylish affordable midsize AWD, especially for our winter. Considered the Fusion (didn't like the looks), Legacy (pricey) and some of the Chrysler models. Then saw the new Avenger and liked it (and the price) immediately. Good headroom and space, front and back. High sides on front seats may be uncomfortable for wider bottoms. Nice dashboard and interior lighting. Don't care much for the hard plastic finishes. Didn't bother with the Navigation system - the technology is changing too fast. Getting lots of admiring looks in the parking lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I got one of the first on the lot and fell in love with it at first sight. Great styling. Pick-up is great but I'm no rabbit and the worst mileage I've gotten is 28.1 with 32.2 on a recent long trip. Sure is nice to drive 7+ hours before I have to fill up with cruise control set on 73. I'm over 60 and it's easy to get in and out of. The interior is well laid out and very quiet. Love that can cooler and 6 CD changer for long drives. Fold down rear arm rest is the best yet for passengers. Trunk is humungous and makes it easy to stash lots of stuff. Also love the dual-level console with the sliding arm rest so I can put it where I need it. The adjustable lumbar support is great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mileage. After that performance, comfort of ride, lumbar support, stereo system, can cooler and how could I forget the lifetime warranty on the drive train.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I absolutely love this car. The way it looks, the way it drives, everything. I finally got rid of my Jeep after 10 years & knew I was in the market for a sedan. My first choice was the Sebring, but when we saw this car on the lot, I had to drive it and oh my God. How I love this car. I haven't seen too many on the roads yet, but I have a feeling this is going to be a very popular choice of vehicle for all people.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Avenger being my first car (going from trucks) in 15 years, I was a bit nervous about how well I would settle in to driving it. But, this car has turned out to be a blast to drive. Smooth shifting and handling, responsive accelleration, better than stated fuel economy (19 mpg combo hwy/city) and a bunch of nifty creature comforts. I will be interested to see how well the AWD with ESP does on icy roads. No regrets here!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car because I was looking for an affordable AWD car that also had great looks.So far I am very satisfied with my Avenger. The R/T trim adds the most powerful engine available and it is plenty powerful. The car can take off when I need it to. There is ample room, both front and back. Watch for the blindspots they are numerous. Overall I am very happy with the car and in retrospect would still definately buy it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MyGig is great. MyGig combines Navagation, radio, multimedia and Bluetooth into one system. All parts work very well. The voice command system is the best I have ever seen.

<TEXT>I have been looking for a new midsize car for the last few months and have been to every dealer we have in town here. This is the only care that stirred any emotional response from me and it did that very well. I drove the SXT and the R/T, the R/T is defiantly the way to go if you like spirited driving. I have only had the car a few weeks but I haven?t found any thing to regret this buy. I really recommend this car for anyone shopping in the midsize market that wants to stand out and have fun doing so.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>3.5 engine with the 6 speed is a match thats hard to beat from any make or price. The exterior styling sets it apart from the bland consertive midsize crowd. Interior design and layout carry over the edgy exterior lines.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is peppy and takes hills very well. Sharp styling. Fun to drive. Check out the paint before you drive in home from the dealer. I noticed when I got home a few imperfections in the paint. I have Silver Steel metallic and it's great. Plenty of room on a trip with kids. Don't think because it's 4 cylinder that's a dog. It's a 16 valve. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought this car and couldn't be happier. Did quite a bit of shopping and comparing before I purchaed it. Looked at the Caliber hard too since it's the same platform. Handles great, very quick although slightly 'doggish' when the air is blasting 0-40. The transaxle shifting is very nice and it looks great. Gas mileage on the first tank was around 25.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very sharp looking with a 3/4 Charger look. Rides firm, solid without being harsh. 6 speed automatic shifts quickly and smooth with no lag between gears. Mileage is same as advertised. Full of features like the upper bin that keeps soda cans cool and the hot or cold beverage holder in the console. Both ways work excellent. Interior lighting at night is awesome - almost like high end aircraft! ATC keeps temperature inside constant, no dialing up or down needed once you find your comfort zone. 3.5 engine is quiet and the exhaust has a really cool, high performance sound. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I only have about 600 miles, but am happy thus far. I purchased an extended warranty, not happy with stadard warranty! I hope the quality continues, and does not degrade over time. The AWD mileage is about 16 thus far with mixed driving, which isn't good, and about the worst for a car with its engine size and horse power. Wife's 2000 Nissan Pathfinder gets 17 under same conditions. Overall I like the car, and think it's a good value for the money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have the SXT with the 2.7L flex fuel engine. Rides far better on Michigan's roads than our Accord did. Interior design is also better. Unfortunately the interior has too much cheap, hard, and gray plastic. It's also slower than our 2001 Stratus ES with the same engine, and gets 5 MPG less. Somehow Dodge has made this engine sound like it came from a bread truck instead of the nice exhaust sound on the Stratus and smooth acceleration. The Avenger seems to "fight" it's way up to speed. We have the upgraded seats and even those are awful. No comfort at all and they squeak like crazy. Like the looks, love the design, but needs better quality, MPG, and be put on a diet. Close, but no cigar.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My initial plans were to buy a Chrysler 300C this year. However, the significantly lower price and sexy looks of the Avenger caught my attention when I went to the dealership. I first testdrove the SXT, but then on impulse, I decided to purchase the R/T sitting on the showroom floor. I was amazed at the difference. The R/T is at least as much fun to drive as the BMW 328i I had a few cars back. I bought it three days ago, and I love driving it so much that I've already put a thousand miles on it. It's just fun to drive, and a great value for the money. Also, four people have plenty of room, which is something I didn't expect in a car this size. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The beverage chiller is great, and the in-dash CD changer is pretty neat, too. Above all, though, my favorite feature is the 18-inch wheels, which make for a very smooth ride. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Perfect for my needs. I don't really need the size or power of the Charger/Mustang, but I liked the exterior lines/shape of the Charger. The Avenger's 4 cylinder engine is so quiet that you wouldn't expect the power behind it. Last tank was 32 mpg on the highway, which is what I had hoped for. Handles great in the city for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I never had a spoiler before, but this one is very classy. The Boston Acoustics system is a must for music lovers. I can turn up the volume and still talk to the passenger as opposed to yelling over the noise. The fold down back seats have really come in handy for loading big items into the trunk.</FAVORITE>

It handles really well, and I have the power to pass and go when I need it no problem. I also like the extra elecrical outlets and cup holders, the fold down seats and the huge trunk on a good sized car. Not too big, not too small. Just right.

The RT head rests blocks any hope of seeing what is just behind you or beside you. Also every time you lift the trunk lid when it is raining all the water pours into the trunk, no it is not just an alignment issue some one get this design wrong.

The front seats are very uncomfortable, I cannot imagine a larger person sitting in them, the blind spots...No you do not get use to them. There are some good points, smooth to drive and roomy and does have pick up and go. Interior is plastic, hard to clean and difficult to get things that have dropped between the seats.

<AUTHOR>WORST CAR TO OWN</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I purchased my 2008 Avenger in April 2008. I am very disappointed with it. I have 12,478 miles on it. Brakes grind, door and side pannels creek like crazy...cant find that problem to fix, Im on my 4th mygig radio(Keeps Freezing up). Sluggish tranny(4cyl). Front noises when you turn or go over a bump. AC doesnt work well, numerous blind spots, chrome plasic around shifter inside blinds driver, poorly designed trunk pours water into the trunk when wet and many many more just running out of room. PLEASE DO NOT BUY ONE.JUNK This is just the worst car I have ever owned. Back in 1997 I had a brand new avenger and loved it so I thought I would take a chance with the 2008. What a mistake. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My Avenger is definitely a Highmilage Vehicle and I bought it specifically for the Lifetime Warranty. With the 2.7V6 I get ~27+ MPG on the Highway and 23+ City. I love the fact it looks so different then all the Accords and Camry's on the road. I LOVE the MyGig Entertainment and have more than 1,000 songs and albums downloaded with still a TON of room to go. The Chill zone is Great even though it eats up a lil room in the glove box. Besides the Glove Box is for a Owners Manual and a couple parking tickets, the rest is trash! Plenty of room for both my kids and the Stain Repel Seats have already paid for themselves. I absolutely Love my Avenger! </TEXT>

They need to be replaced again at 27,000 miles. Paint is fading between back tires and rear passenger doors. In July 2008, dealership put on plastic film to stop the paint job from getting worse. The paint is now fading around the coating. On each side of the car, there is a 8 x 10 inch area that is light gray (versus the dark gray paint job. A terrible car for the money.

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle with 20,000 miles on it. As a person finishing up college, I was looking for something reliable and affordable yet still stilish and interesting. Fuel consumption is amazing- I took a 300 mile trip at around 75 mph speeds and used only 1/2 tank of gas. I look for any reason to drive this car! The 4 cylinder engine isn't dissappointing- it delivers adequate acceleration and plenty of power for me. The speakers are great, love the light grey interior, and although the seats are a little uncomfortably firm, I am adjusting. This isn't a luxury car but it's reasonably priced, gets a ton of compliments, and is a pleasure to operate, plus the fuel economy is great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sliding arm rest- good for us short people. The auxillary outlet is nice for connecting an mp3 player. Huge trunk and backseat is roomy enough for riding with friends and taking trips. Built in sirrius satellite radio. Auto down driver's window.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car with 14,000 miles on it 8 months ago.It has ample power and plenty of interior space.It has more than it's share of blind spots and a rather cheesy interior. I like the sound system and smooth ride.But....without warning at 20,000 miles,when attempting to put the automatic transmission in gear one night after start up it would not budge.I tried everything suggested in the owners to no avail.Ended up getting towed to a dodge dealership where they somehow managed to unlock the shifter.They claimed to have replaced the shifter because it was broken which was an obvious lie.I have since learned that this "locking" shifter is a common Chrysler problem yet no recall is issued.</TEXT>

<TEXT>i bought this car back in sept 2007 never was a big chrysler fan but test drove it and loved it.. i admit the 4cyl was not to my liking so drove the 6cyl 2.7 flexfuel and fell in love. have had a few minor things wrong but all new models usually do.. plus with the lifetime powertrain warranty dont have to much worrys. as far as the flexfuel i get less mileage but more horsepower than with the 87 octain where as with that i get better mileage but less horsepower. so those of you who are car shopping i recommend this vehicle. no complaints here....</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a Toyota Corolla for the past 7 years and decided to buy American. Thought I'd go with a mini Charger muscle car and purchased the Avenger R/T. Goes like stink but the payoff is frequent stops at the pump. 6 speed auto stick should have been better engineered with a 5 speed. The interior comfort could be better as well as the quality and construction of materials, read cheap. Lots of great features though. Awesome sound system, creature comforts galore, powerful engine and lots of compliments from casual observers. Chrysler has something here, if they would just finish it off with a better interior grade of materials. Fun to drive. I'd give it an 8.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Poor gas millage, poor interior design, poor performance. It feels very heavy for I4 engine. Very poor handling around the corners. Seats are hard. Not comfy. door packets are so small you can not even put an envelope. Steering soft but wobbly like Lincoln towncar. 0 to 60 forever. Only good thing is the slick look, other than that no comparison </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just logged 22K on my Avenger and haven't had any problems with it. I change my own oil, have the tires rotated and balanced and wash it every now and then. It really is a great car to drive, it doesn't have the power of the beefier 3.5L Avenger, but the 3.5l isn't getting the great gas mileage either. I consistently get about 27-29 Hwy/City per gallon. I can take a 5 hour trip (75MPH) and not have to stop for gas. The interior is a little "plastic", but it's functional and has the beverage chiller to boot! I did not opt for the sport package they offered, but I've seen others and it does add quite a bit of flair to exterior, it looks great as it sits though. Overall, it's a great car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a 2008 Avenger SE with the VVT 4 cylinder and it is a fun car. Yeah the more expensive foreign cars and the luxurious Ford Fusion have more for the buck in some areas but let someone who drives one be the critic. This car?s engine and transmission is assisted by electronic computer main board like most new cars in this case the computer adjusts the engine and trans to your driving habits. I drive my Avenger on the Washington D.C. beltway where you have to get up and go. Well some folks have asked me if I had the six cylinders under the hood, my car is fun to drive, sporty, and the safest thing on the road</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sleek muscle car look of the exterior. The sporty instrument panel and chrome trim shift gear floor console. The 4 cyclinders performance at highway speeds - feels like a bigger six when its time to move on. Best of all the six airbags and other safety features that earned the Avenger 5 stars.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Alright so this car is not worth it. I have the 2.4 and it won't get out of its own way. The radio is not good if you like to turn it up and have some fun. Rear drum brakes no abs? Really in 2008? For my money you can get a more from other companies. Maybe the V6 loaded up is fun I'm sure but if you're in the market for the SE you are not going to be happy and have to look around and not just buy this car because you think it looks cool!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my vehicle in July of 2007 and a month later had to bring it in because I returned to the vehicle after leaving work and discovered the driver's side door hanging wide open. When I took it to the dealer I learned that there was a recall for the latches. During this year I have taken the car to the dealer five times and had three different recalls. Most recently the belly shield fell off the bottom of the vehicle. Now that it has been replaced the car is shaking, the heat is not working and the temperature gauge is running hot so it appears I will be at the dealer once again. I regret purchasing this vehicle and would not recommend this product to anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned our AWD R/T for a couple of months, and we absolutely love it. The bold styling is refreshing. We had looked at Mazda 6 and Camry, but found the styling cues old. The performance is bang on for the driving we do, the autostick works great and with so many features and comforts we are anxious to find a reason to drive it. While it's a far cry from previous R/T's I have owned (70's), it's still an exciting car to drive in its own right. Quiet and well mannered day to day, it has great acceleration when prompted with a sweet exhaust note. The Nav system and MyGig is great, bells and whistles galore...Love it, my only problem is getting my wife to give it up</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has help up great after one year. I was very hesitant buying an American car. My last vehicle was a Chevy S-10 that was a piece of crap. I swore I would never buy another American car again, until I rented the Dodge Avenger on a trip. Interior: Despite all of the reviews, the interior is very nice and has held up with no squeaks or creaks. There could be a little padding on the arm rest and center console, but otherwise very nice. Engine/Drivetrain: The weak point in this whole car is the 4 speed transmission, it has quite a lag in shift points. The 6 speed offered in the R/T is much, much better. Rear drum brakes, really. I thought these had died out. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my 2008 Avenger SXT! It's just a fun car to drive. Going from a Dodge Ram to an Avenger is a big difference, but the car makes the change very easy. I wish I had a longer commute to work so I could experience more of the car and what it can do. The MyGig entertainment system is a must! If you are going to get the SXT model get it with the sports appearance package; the fog lamps and rear spoiler makes the car look even more aggressive and more appealing. It rides very smooth and has more power and pick-up than I anticipatied! Everyone that has taken a ride in it loves it as well. A great car for a great price!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the Avenger when we turned in our lease on a Dodge Caravan. My wife loves the Avenger. She is getting 24 miles per gallon (true city driving). You feel like you are sitting up high. You do sacrifice that performance feel at the start, but the city mileage out weighs the strong "pedal" feel. Nice size car for our family of five. Handling and acceleration is "soft" compared to my Mazda 6. So far we are very satisfied with the Avenger!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went with the 2.7 V6 with the 18" premium wheels and with the Inferno Red color. It is as sharp as can be. It does great in town and super-great on long trips. Really like the Sirius radio and for a standard stero with 6- speakers it sounds supreme. Being 6'2" the leg room is outstanding. The best part though is the body styling, nice and manly, not wimpy like the Camry.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have never been so disappointed in a vehicle in all my life. I purchased this to get rid of my GAS GUZZLING Durango. Went with another Dodge because they gave me a better trade value, but boy the joke was on me. This car is built DIRT CHEAP. I've had it just over a year and thus far the following has gone bad and had to be replaced: Fuel Pump, Steering Pump,Valve, Half-Shaft, Water Pump, Gasket. And with all this, problems persist, but unfortunately, warranty has ended.</TEXT>

I actually get more than the stats that were stated when I bought it. The cooler thing is not what I thought it would be but the satellite radio has spoiled this ole gal's music experience, I can never be without it again.

<TEXT>Just bought a 2008 Avenger R/T with all the bells and whistles except the rear seat DVD thing. A little history first: I'm 61 my wife is 59. We test drove lots of vehicles. After lots of Internet searching and dealer quotes. We settled on the Avenger (SXT 4cyl). Liked the styling, options etc, drove it for a weekend. Power didn't make the grade (pardon the pun) for us. Went back to dealer, road tested the Avenger R/T and WOW! Hot damn! Now that's what I'm talking about. After the usual haggling etc. we got a great price (and trade in) on a Stone White 3.5 HO V6. Have driven it for four days now and I LOVE THIS CAR! and I've had many in my life. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>POWER. MyGig is very cool even with "standard" speaker set up. Heated seats and hot/cold cup holder, leather seats are comfortable and very adjustable. I love the "personal settings" menu. You can set your settings for lots of different things. Too cool. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have to say that the styling on the new Avenger blows me away every time I look at It.It looks like a mini Charger and for the price of a base Charger Mine is almost fully loaded. My main problem has been with the nav/radio.This is the third time my car has been in the shop in three months.I am on my second Nav/radio and still have problems.The radio does not respond, or turns off while driving or there is no volume. I also noticed my daytime lights go out when I signal. The ugly has to be the light colored sun visors and roof.I can see the sun visors getting dirty and they must be cleaned often.The front headrests need to be redesigned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my 08 Tor Red Avenger SXT for a couple of months now and love it. If you are looking for a performance car, this is not for you. If you want stylish, economical transportation that turns heads, take a look at this car. It won't disappoint. Seating for me is very comfortable (5'6"), fits the curve of my back just right. Mygig radio is a nice system, though I am disappointed as I thought I could load my iPod onto it and can't because it doesn't read the mP4 format. You can use the aux input to play your iPod through the system though. If I had known that, I'd of stuck with the regular radio as I find myself having to look at the radio to change stations which is distracting.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned a truck for the last 30 years and never thought I would own a car again. The Avenger changed my mind! The exterior definitely turns heads when you're driving down the road. The interior is surprisingly roomy, and trunk space is great. The blue dashboard glow is very soothing, and the instrument panel is laid out nicely. There are, however, three things that I would personally change in the interior, and they are: add an overhead compartment for sunglasses, raise the center console a bit higher for a more comfortable armrest, and flatten the headrest a bit so it doesn't feel like your head is being pushed forward. The headrest was an easy fix for me by turning it around.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning my Dodge Avenger R/T AWD for only 1076 miles (no payments made yet!) my transmission has begun shifting way to early causing a tranny chatter. For example between 40 and 50 miles an hour the transmission has already shifted into 6th gear. Grrr. Instead of down-shifting the tranny "chatters" and shakes. I truly love the car and hope the dealership can repair it quickly without problems. Waited my whole life to buy "new" and it's going into the shop before the first payment is due! </TEXT>

I'm 6ft and 285lbs and I fit comfortably. However, the door roof is a bit low - I can easily bang my head getting into the car if I'm not careful. There's also this weird thing that happened twice. When I'm doing a K Turn, if I take the car out of reverse and into drive to quickly the car shuts off.

<TEXT>This car is unbelievably bad. Steering wheel is hard to get under when getting in even when in its highest position, the low top of the side-window area is easy to hit your head on when you get in and out, the cup holders are in a lousy position and too far behind the driver, the visors are in the way even in their highest position, the seats are uncomfortable, and the locks make an obnoxiously loud noise when they self-lock after a minute or so when driving. These are just first impressions since I probably haven't had time to find the things really wrong with the car. I have recently rented Ford Fusions and Chev Malibu's which were much better (I own a Lexus GS, but am not comparing it).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just took delivery of a fleet Avenger -its got the 2.7 liter V6. This car has plenty of power. Don't believe the car reviews. It's quiet, smooth,looks like nothing else on the road. The style is quirky, but grows on you. I haven't had it long, I have owned two Sebrings before and NEVER had a problem with them. The Avenger surprises me with its extras- outside temp gauge, tire pressure warning, power adj driver seat, 4 wheel disc brakes, and Sirius radio. And the price was unbeatable. Way more room inside than the new Malibu. If I could have, would have picked the SXT If you want to buy American- this car is hard to beat.

<TEXT>Just got back from a 10 day 4,000 mi vacation. I could not be any happier, other than a little softer seats, but it is a sport ride suspension. In dash mpg usually a little high (1-2 mpg) but I want to say this, I drove this on the interstate at speeds around 85-90 mph and through the Rockies and I never got less than 25 mpg in the mountains (with plenty of power) 27-30 on the hwy. The c-pillar blind spot is a little bad also but I knew about that before I ordered this car. I plan on having this for a long time so after working for gm for 17 yrs. I will take the plastic over the vinyl, cloth or leather that either shrinks, gets stained, torn, falls apart or has to be maintained w/special cleaners.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car for my son and myself to drive. It's been a great car and gets great mileage. We bought the 4 cylinder and am totally happy so far. We have around 10,000 miles on it now and it gets right at 30 miles a gallon which you have to love! We get lots of looks because its sporty and its Sunburst Pearl Orange. What a beautiful car!

<TEXT>My dad just recently purchased my avenger for me as a first car. I love to drive it. Its so comfortable and has great power to be a four cylinder. The features are great. The avenger has a mini fridge option in the dash. I have it and it is operational. I love this car! It has great steering and its economical too. If you are looking for a small, economical, but comfortable car the Dodge avenger would be a great consideration!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I can't believe how critical everyone is. Complaining about the plastic interior being to plastic, excuse me if this car doesn't have that fake Lexus plastic dash. The seats are to hard! It sounds to me you are all to old to be driving. This car blows away any Toyota I have previously owned. I bought the 2.7 V6 engine and getting 27 mpg. It rides better then a Fusion, or Camry. The interior is logically laid out and the ride is excellent. The Dodge 4- speed tranny shifts great. 100% better the Toyota 4-speed tranny which constantly mis-shifts. The price with all the options blows away the competitors, the lifetime warranty may have some uncertainties but what the hell its better then just 3-yr</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>2.7 V6, Heated Seats, Mgig Stereo, Spoiler, to many to list. I have had this car for 2-months and 75-miles a day. So far it is a dream no problems to report. My 2004 V6 Camry was in the dealer at minimum 10x in the first 2- months.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Excellent vehicle overall. The ride is firmer, but with very good acceleration above 4k RPM. Adjusting the steering wheel more vertically "hides" the top 3/4 of the speedometer which is inconvenient. Tends to shift/downshift somewhat hard in lower gears below 2k RPM. Trunk lid opens heavy, but is fairly roomy for a mid-width "sporty" car. Leather trimmed seats will stretch where you sit and eventually crack in the "non" leather seat material (if not treated). Maintains 21-24 MPG with shared city/highway driving. Headrests VERY uncomfortable as they angle toward the occupant with no tilt-adjustment - forcing driver to nod, making longer journeys hard on the middle back (unless you lean WAY back)</TEXT>

<TEXT>STX V6. Seriously, could there be a cheaper car built that claims quality? The interior is all plastic and screams cheesy. Tranny chirps when decelerating and chugs on low rpm. Dealer said this was normal. NORMAL! Was raining when I bought it used. Salesman said nothing wrong with it. There were scratches all over the trunk deck and a big scratch in the bumper. Dirty inside. He said it would be detailed. Got it back with deodorant dumped under floor mats. Not cleaned. Seats are hard as a rock. When I emailed customer service because I couldn't get satisfaction from dealer all I received was an automated response. I hate this car! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Avenger a few weeks ago. I have a Durango and the mileage and fuel costs were hurting me. I kept my Durango because I love my truck and bought the Avenger for work during the week because of the mileage factor. This is a great car that is giving me an average of 28.9 miles a gallon. I would recommend this car to anybody, especially if you are looking for fuel economy with gas prices heading towards 4.00 dollars + a gallon. I'm a Chrysler guy and this is worth the investment. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Upgraded from a Dodge Caliber to an Avenger RT 08. I needed more trunk space for my golf clubs and other items that the caliber could not help me with. I love the 235 horsepower (feels like more) and the way it feels around the turns. It looks good, it feels good, it drives good. I am in love again after 40. If you want fun, try driving one. I love the satellite radio, navigational system and the blue tooth. I gives you what it promises. Some might complaint about the MPG, but they forget, it is a V6 mean machine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Born and Raised a "GM Girl", I felt almost disloyal when I purchased my Avenger SE, but BOY am I glad I did! It's a great car for money! It has a spacious interior and many extras that you wouldn't expect in a base model. Cool Zone cup holders, 2 part adjustable arm rest/storage console and a folding rear seat with rear passenger armrest, makes for enjoyable road trips. It's easy to get in & out of and has plenty of headroom, which if you have tall and/or aging loved ones, this is a HUGE plus. The exterior is probably the biggest surprise of all. Who would have thought you can get a car that looks that cool for under 20K? It certainly wouldn't have been me! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior is AWESOME!!!! Nice lines and a great look. I definitely turn heads with this car!Trunk is roomy and has low profile entry, which is nice when you have heavy packages. No need to lift up & over then set down. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have the SXT, 2.7 V6. This car is the biggest piece of junk I have ever owned. 3 1/2 weeks old, only put 200 miles on it. The lifters in the motor were bad. Water leaking onto floor, seat belts kept getting wet inside the door. Trunk leaking. Stereo speakers stopped working. The inside of this brand new car has all been taken apart, roof, doors, moldings, sunroof & nothing fits the same way as from the factory. This car has been back to the dealer 2-3 times every month since last June. Not enough space to list all problems. Now,the ignition switch sticks/stays in the start position (trying to start the car) BUT the car is already running, JUNK ! LEMON !!! Back to the dealer again !</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really love the body style of this car The R/T is the more sporty of the bunch with the performance and handling, which is why I chose it. The seats are amazingly comfortable I also have the heated ones so that makes for a enjoyable ride. The sunroof also adds flair to it. I'm planning on ordering the windbreaker to accent the sunroof. You really should test drive this to get the full extent of the vehicle, I honestly have no regrets on purchasing this vehicle. it rides smoothly and even more so with weight in it. I honestly have no complaints about the car it handles like a dream and I love the character it has it screams I'm Ram Tough!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tough muscle looking body style. Interior, very roomy, great for taller people they have plenty of leg room and head room. Stereo features and for factory speakers it rocks! Huge trunk.

<TEXT>I traded my 2003 Dodge Stratus R/T in for the Avenger R/T FWD. After a lot of looking for a sporty, fun, and practical car the Avenger was my best bet. I first test drove the AWD but I was disappointed by the acceleration and handling. The AWD doesn't get the performance suspension like the FWD does. The convenience package is worth the money. While the interior is semi-cheap looking everything is very functional and is quite easy to clean. The seats I find to be very comfortable, especially on long rides. Carpooling is a breeze, and the acceleration is hands down awesome for a car in this class.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the acceleration and the handling. Very aggressive exterior design and this car gets a lot of looks. The 6 speed autostick also makes this car even more fun to drive! Really feels like a sports car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car was bought for my wife. We wanted a car that was sporty but practical, and when I had to be in it was not too "girly". We bought the r/t with every option except the dvd stuff. The car so far has been great. It handles well, rides well and is decent on gas mpg. It's quiet and roomy on inside. Four adults fit comfortably. We have both gotten speeding tickets in it, so while it's no Ferrari, it's fast enough for us!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought the car a week ago. So far it is fantastic. Best looking mid size sedan out there. Test drove a Camry first and the Avenger is much more comfortable. Camry did not have enough head room to even make it an option for me and I'm only 6'1". After 700 miles of mostly highway/interstate driving I'm getting 29.8 mpg which is about what I expected and in my opinion this car is a great balance between power and fuel economy. Even though its a small engine it produces a very adequate 174 hp. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After 5000 miles I can definitely say that the Avenger is a car worth buying. My R/T is sufficiently fast although not especially fuel efficient. I mean, 14 mpg is really below average (mostly city driving). Still, the car is a head turner, drives well, comes with AWD and is perfectly fine for the daily commute while still being relatively affordable. Seats have been updated (lucky for those of you who buy after July 07) and are significantly more comfortable. I recommend the car to anyone who wants to original, while still getting a good car. Reports say that the SXT and SE trims are not worth your money. The R/T is more well endorsed. Good Luck</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My R/T was equipped with the MYGIG entertainment system which includes the audio, navigation, cellular bluetooth, and more into one easy to navigate package that is updatable through the computer. Nav is good. Remote start is a great (and cheap) feature, get it. Aux jack included (Ipod anyone?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really love the design of this car. It's sporty and was reasonably priced. Would like to of had the RT, but that was pricey. The interior needs to be a better quality. It looks cheap.

<TEXT>For the first few months that I had my new Avenger, I loved it. Then came the cold weather, and with it an unrepairable transmission problem. Less than 5 miles into any drive on a freeway, the RPMs shoot from the standard 2000 to 6000. And it's as though someone downshifted to first gear. It takes all the power the car has to get to the shoulder. Once restarted, the car performs fine for the rest of the trip. Leaving it with the service department won't help as they won't be able to recreate the problem. And even if they could, since the engine light doesn't come on with a transmission error, the onboard computer won't register the problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Drive this car along I-90 in WY. Hit a deer at 75 mph with 250 miles on the odometer and the car ran another 75 miles to get me home. Realized that all that the damage was mostly plastic and that had probably saved the structural aspects of the car. Was wearing my seatbelt and I did not get tossed foward at all, felt extremely safe. I drive this car 120 miles round trip to work and home, through the fall and now winter, good handling car, I have not had any problems driving on snow and no problems starting this car in the cold. Brakes and steering are not soft and not touchy. Decent clearance for a lower riding car, suspension is great and rougher roads/dirt roads are no problem for this car</TEXT>

The interior is very quiet, the seats are perfect, and I am getting around 28 mpg in mostly city driving. My old car was a 2003 Honda, I like the Avenger much better. It's more comfortable, quieter, accelerates better, gets better mpg, looks better, costs less, has a drink cooler in the dash! and has a better warranty. What more could you want?
