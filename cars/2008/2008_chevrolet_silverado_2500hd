<TEXT>Finally purchased the best BigBoy toy available. The Duramax 2500 LTZ is the best of both work and play. Makes light work of pulling my horses. The leather loaded Escalade like interior makes an A+ ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I upgraded from a 2003 Chevy 1500 Z71 package. I'm towing a lot more now and I needed something with a little more umph. This truck has it. I thought about the diesel for this truck but I opted for the 6.0 because you never know when the prices are going to sky rocket again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the fact that the trailer brake box is built into the dash. So, no ugly box hanging down to knock your knee on. The second fact is the six speed automatic. I like you can put it into manual mode to shift it like a manual for the steep hills. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my Silverado for over a year now with no problems to report. The Duramax/Allison is an absolutely amazing combination, leaves the competition in the dust. My only complaint was the small wheels and tires from the factory. Overall, an excellent built truck period.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is by far the worst vehicle I have ever owned. The interior started rattling after 2500 miles. The chrome on the grill peeled after one winter in Montana. The new exhaust system is a joke. I had this truck in the dealership eight times in the first six months of which two required towing it there. The tranny fails to shift out of 5th gear after busting through heavy snow drifts. Off road traction is terrible this truck won't drive through 3 inches of snow without putting it in 4wd. Fuel economy is decent when it's empty. It gets 14 to 18mpg at 75mph. A light 16ft interstate cargo trailer will bring that down to about 9mpg. My truck is for sale and you couldn't give me another one</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>love the power! Integrated trailer brakes- why was this not done years ago?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got the 6.6 Duramax diesel with the Alison 6 speed. Rated #1 for 08. Tows like a champ, Plenty of power. LT2 package, rear differential locker, Bose speaker package, OnStar, XM radio. I added a spray in bedliner and sliding 5th hitch too. My opinion is that Chevy is far superior to Dodge Cummins 5.9L. Go get one. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior has a nice look and feel. Gotta feel good when your in a truck as long as I am.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Duramax is quiet, smooth and powerful. 0-60 times that will make most cars see your tail lights. The interior of the LTZ is all luxury, void of squeaks and rattles on the roughest roads. The Bose 6 disk is very impressive for a factory system using a center placed subwoofer and 6 speakers. Smoother, stronger and better mileage than the 6.0L 2005 2500HD it replaced. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Got the 6.6 Duramax with the Alison 6 speed, only way to go! Did my Consumer review research and found Chevy diesel rated the best all round of the Big 3 for 08'! Can't even complain about the mileage. Adverage of 18 mpg, 21 mpg at 55-60 crusing the interstate (unloaded). Love how the Alison tranny grabs hold of the engine when the tow mode is turned on and sounds awesome. I got he 17" rims with my truck which I highly recommend. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bose speaker system, interior design has all kinds of room and is very attractive yet tough! Rubber floor mats was an excellent idea. Remote start for the cold mornings and hot days!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ok I have had this truck for a week and I love it. I traded in my 07 1500 LS Crew Cab with a 4.8L because it didn't tow my trailer as good as I wanted. After dirving this truck for a week it flat out performs my 07, in every aspect. You can feel the power difference in the 08. Gas mileage has been good for me as well. I averaged 18.3 on the highway last night going 75-80 for 300 miles round trip. I guess with some mods it should get better. Not a fan of the smaller looking tires on this truck. As big as this truck is you would expect tires that fill the wheel wells. Again this is an excellent truck all around Great job GM.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power! Interior is not too shabby, have a little better than a 2LT but not as much as an LTZ</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 6th Duramax (and still have the 5th) and I love the new interior design with Nav and DVD players. Sunroof definitely better too. My only complaint is the new emmissions equipment really chokes this thing and kills mileage; I get 14 in town and 18 highway with some modifications. For those wanting a better ride, try a front leveling kit with longer shocks; it helps tremendously. Also try a cold air intake and bigger exhaust; helped my mileage alot. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>LTZ interior, navigation, sunroof, Duramax/Allison combo unbeatable. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first deisel and I love it! This thing tows my toy hauler trailer like it's not even there. I have had no issues at all and I have 4K miles on it. I get 12- 13mpg towing and 15-16mpg not. My brother has the Dodge and I feel that the motor in the Chevy feels much more refined.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always been a Ford guy, but when shopping for the F250 versus Silverado 2500, I thought the Chevy had a better ride, a nicer interior, a the dealer was very aggressive in terms of pricing. Mileage has been OK so far, well within my expectations. Also, very pleased with the looks of the truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior and ride was what sold me. The diesel can pull more than anything I will ever need to pull. And it's a very queit motor once warmed up.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've been studying diesels for a few years now. Wanted one in a 2005 Liberty, wife at the time didn't. Finally bought what I wanted after the divorce. Went from two vehicles to one, so this is a daily driver and the only viable daily driver amongst the big three IMO. I get 14 mpg city A/C on (with lots of idling and sitting at lights), 19.5 highway (70 to 75 mph). Not bad for a vehicle that weighs this much and can tow 15,400 lbs. Can't imagine feeding the old gas big block! Ride is a little rough on bad roads because of the heavy duty nature. I'm researching how to change that (airbags, different springs/shocks). With a load, it's perfect.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Without a doubt: Duramax/Allison. This is by far the best light diesel drivetrain on the market. Test drive them all; you'll see. I still have respect for Cummins. None for Powerstroke. My interior is very nice. Wish it had the LT2 cloth but could not live without bench seat in extended cab.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have an '08 2500HD. It's a good truck but I have already broke down first time I towed my RV (6000 lbs). Fuel mileage is terrible. 13 -15 mpg. When I tow this little RV mileage drops to 8-9 mpg. My father's '05 is twice as good on fuel with a load 15-17 mpg. They really missed the boat with this new emmissions package. Knowing what I know now I would not have bought this truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I started off by driving the Dodge and Ford. Wasn't impressed. The second I sat in this thing I could tell this was a different truck. After 5 minutes of driving, I was sold. Everyone complaining about the gas mileage, it's a 3/4 ton truck. What do you expect? Its not a Prius. 15-16 mpgs stock is not bad. A few cheap mods and Im pulling off 20 mpgs and better. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth ride, caddy-like interior, comfy seats, sunroof, remote start with temp sensor, I could go on.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first Chevy was a 3/4 ton Scottsdale bought new in 1979 and sold in 1995 so I keep a good truck. This is a keeper. I tow a 8000lb travel trailer and this think tows it like a tank and I love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new diesel. Plenty of power no need for aftermarket chips. Rides great. Looks great. Pulls great, but the fuel mileage is terrible. 13 mpg is the best I get. It has been four months now. I have 15,000 miles on it and cannot get any better mileage. With the price of fuel ($4.15) it hurts when you pull up to the pump </TEXT>

<TEXT>Duramax w/Ali Tranny - very good value. Sticker 44.8k - Paid 35.3k. Very nice ride - itty bitty tires though (16"?) that I'm gonna replace. Fuel economy on new diesels flat out stinks - no reason it should be that low. Love the interior - plenty of room. Well designed for towing and work.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Desert Brown metallic - nice color Duramax engine - excellent power Interior layout - very well done</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>GM quality is going up while Toyota is going down. This truck is used as a family truck, camper trailer towing and snow plowing my drive. I guess the previous poster did not have his truck set up correctly for snow plowing. You should have ordered the aux. battery and larger alternator. That's what those options are specifically for. I have a HD plow it it works fine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have an on going problem when trying to plow with this truck.It loses amperage so bad I can not pick the plow up until I shut the truck off and wait a bit before restarting.They put on a new voltage regulator,new computer etc.When the mechanic called the GM rep and discussed this with him he said there was nothing wrong.I make a living with my truck and have had 12+ Chevys over the years with no problems,this is ridiculous.I feel I am being pushed aside because they dont know whats wrong yet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a beautiful truck. The style has really grown on me since it first came out( it looks great with after market wheels and tires). It has a good ride and is comfortable to drive. The back up sensors are nice with a big truck like this. The power is much less noticeable than my 2006 with the LBZ . It has been in the shop 4 times and was in there for over a month the last time. I may sell this one and keep my 06. All new diesels seam to have exhaust problems. You may be better off to purchase a pre January 1 diesel to avoid problems until all of the issues are resolved. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Chevrolet adding The LTZ with all of the interior changes are my favorite parts of this truck</FAVORITE>
