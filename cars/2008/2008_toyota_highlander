<TEXT>This car cannot make up its mind what gear it should go into. It drives like, (I'm not kidding here), my old 3-speed K-car from the seventies. It can't seem to change gears without first dropping into passing gear, even at 70+ mph in cruise control, thus the "Lurchmobile". But at least I have the comfort of knowing that it looks beautiful and handles like I'm towing a trailer. I guess my overall rating is a 5.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First 2001 Highlander was superior to my 2008. Poor visibility. Seat is so uncomfortable hate to drive for any length of time. 2008 does not handle as well as prior model. No traction in the snow. Mine is an AWD 6 cyl. Interior parts fall off. Very disappointed with 2008 Highlander.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning Jeeps for the last 15 years I was reluctant to go Toyota but with a new baby we needed more room. I was skeptical of the Highlander's 5000lbs tow rating. Now after 11000 miles and several months of towing our 4000lbs 21 ft ski boat I am the Highlander's biggest fan. It pulls and stops our boat better than my Grand Cherokee ever did. Plus this is the most comfortable and solidly built car I have ever owned. Gas mileage is good at a city/hwy avg of 21mpg towing drops it to 13 in our very hilly drive to the lake.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Better Than Honda</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I love everything about it! Went from a 2006 Honda Pilot EXL and have to say this car is a much better design completely. I have a loaded sport model minus the nav. The captain's car make 3rd row usable. Couldn't live w/out power tailgate and back up camera now. I love love love how the extra seats folds away! On average I get 23.8 mpg better than my pilot. Accessories are cheaper than Hondas surprisingly. More bang for the buck than pilot all the way around! Sticker was 37k more than comp. Pilot but after rebate and wheelin' and deal'n got for 28K. The deals are out there just got to find them! Fun to drive mom car w/out looking like the soccer mom van but still very functional!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a Jeep grand Cherokee limited and now this SUV. Love the extra room and the 3rd row. Miss the leather seats...guess once you own a limited it's hard to give up all those extra options. So easy to get the kids in and out and it's not a mini van! Wish that you could down load a picture on the screen for the clock/back up camera. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When I round a corner at normal speed the acceleration hesitates and can't make up its mind if it wants to stay high or go down lower. It's very irritating. My Toyota dealership said it is a gas saving computer thing and the only way to correct it is to drive more aggressively around corners. I tried doing that and my wife put a stop to my NASCAR aspirations. Also, constant issues with the tires. I have owned Toyota's in the past and never had to add air every time I filled up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After careful research on midsize 7 passenger SUVs, I selected the Highlander. The captains chair option with stowaway middle seat is truly novel and well executed. I have two toddlers so the other vehicles in the category that would force you to take out one of the car seats from the second row to get access to the 3rd row just didn't work for me. It has all the bells and whistles I wanted like the rear camera, nav system and heated seats and is super well though out inside. It looks good outside too. I had a Lexus RX 300 before this that I loved, and this is comparable with the bonus of seating the parents and in-laws when they are in town.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have about 1200 miles on my HI sport. Have noticed in rear seats, section of leather is looking stretched out. These two seats sat in app 2 hours a week if that. Not noticed in drivers seat that I am in day in and day out. Dealer saying it's not an issue. I would understand the 'worn' look after a year or two but after 8 weeks, c'mon! Am guessing the pieces of leather may be thinner than other pieced on the seat - I'm not giving in til I get some resolution - this is a 30K vehicle! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has been great so far. The gas mileage is exactly what the sticker says. 16 city and 24 highway. I have averaged 20mpg since I purchased the car. Remember you are driving a car/suv that seats 6/7 people. This not a small vehicle do not expect 30 mpg? The Highlander is very roomy and the second row is great. The captains chairs are awesome. XM have the dealer do it or if you want to save $100 bucks buy the parts from the dealer, then take the parts to a stereo shop for installation. Just came out of a Sierra snow storm and the highlander performed well. AWD works well and the snow button softens your throttle inputs. Toyo A20s are wearing quickly. Had dealer make a note of this.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth. Captains chairs in second row. Ability to seat 6 comfortably. Performance is more than adequate and ride is comfortable. Cup holders everywhere, I am not sure if I have found them all? DAC works beautifully crawls down hills. Ability to select gears reduces need to brake in mountains.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The limited is a good quiet ride. It's really a van disguised as an SUV. Goes in a straight line very well. The interior is roomy and near luxury with leather. Drove and looked at many SUV's and waited for this model to come out. So far, we are glad we did. Averaged 27mpg on last highway trip at 70mph. Runs on regular, engine likes methanol. Beautiful exterior, build quality excellent. Automatic rear door might be a real plus on this SUV. Engine somewhat loud at cold start up, you can hear those 24 valves! Goes away quickly. Bluetooth phone dial by number is not very easy to use but speed dial works very well. This car was more expensive than others we tested, but worth it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first toyota SUV, traded in my older Camry. A smooth and powerful V6 engine, quiet and comfortable ride, nice interior layout and romminess. excellent build quality. But strong engine vibration when cold start, eventually will gone after engine warm up. need to bring back to dealer to check up. Steering and handling are secure but not sound. Fuel economy only so so, I'm conservative drive and try to lite on gas. I only get around 15 mpg mix driving. Rear door hatch is heavy to open and close. Overall is a very nice SUV with some negative.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was anticipating to write a rave review on my 3 month old car. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the high expectations. My gas mileage has been well below the posted 17/22. It has been 11/18 (18 after the car was repaired). Last month, the car would not start. It took five tries and pushing the gas to finally get it started. There was smoke and a burnt smell coming out my engine area. It took the dealership almost three day to figure out the problem, that being a faulty injector. Very frustrating process, poor service from both the selling dealership and Toyota's 800 customer satisfaction line. I find it ironic that our Chevy Silverado, now 6 years old has never needed a repair.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Last vehicle I had was a 1991 Mazda Navajo. What a difference 16 years makes. Did 4 months of research (Edmunds, Cars.com, Vehix, CR) all rated the car well despite new design. Choice between Pilot & Highlander. Pilot was a little too utilitarian and mpg ratings fr: blogs dissuaded me. I made the right choice. Have only had it a month and filled it twice, but highway: got 25 mpg, mixed, got 20.5 mpg despite 6 cylinder, limited, AWD, tow package, backup navi & bluetooth. All user friendly. Highly recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power rear hatch, Smart Key, flexibility of stowed seat/console for 2nd row, ease of flopping both 2nd & 3rd rows, "conversation mirror". Remote operates fr: good distance, at least 1/2 block I could open the hatch w/arms full of grocery bags.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my Highlander for about 2 weeks now and I can honestly say that I would never have leased this car if I had driven it for more than a few minutes. The steering wheel makes a clicking noise and I feel a click when I turn it. The third row has giant headrests that block your view out the back window. This is really not a 7 passenger vehicle unless the person sitting in the middle seat is tiny (and then they should probably be in a carseat!) I dislike driving the Highlander soooo much and don't know how I will keep it for the next 38 1/2 months. Was trying to save some $$ and didn't save very much and got a car that I hate. I keep hoping it will grow on me, but then I drive it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I LOVE this car! We researched new cars for about 5 months before deciding on this one. The interior has more room than the 4runner and yet still has bigger tires and gets better gas mileage. Plus, the third row is standard and folds flat, the 4runner isn't a standard 7-passenger and the seats don't fold flat. The layout of the interior is superior to the pilot and every other car we had test riden. It just by far is the best reliable car that can be sporty, but yet still fit the whole family in. We are a family of 5, and fit very comfortably. I just love driving it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the versatility of the middle row, it can be 2 bucket seats, or have a console, or be 3 seats. The ease of folding the third row... it literally takes 2 seconds to fold flat.</FAVORITE>

Interior is very comfortable, I have cloth b/c all the dealers informed me b/c of a leather embargo, they were now holding leather for Limited only. But Sport has higher grade cloth.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice looking 19" rims, Bluetooth, Toyota two-tone steering wheel feels luxury to me, big-button console configured well, 270 hp moves well, handles well w/ small turning circle and not bad gas mileage for an SUV. JBL sound system is very good for factory. Likely high re-sale value. 3rd seat option.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just got the new highlander - wonderful car. Works well and has enough room for 7. Contrary to beliefs, and reading many reviews, the highlander does have PLENTY of room for a full size adult in the 3rd row. In addition, the highlander can move the seats and contains much more room inside. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I think that the 3rd row is the best. You can actually put it up or down, without having to have it split. Highlander is great for a family of 7, but if you want a BIG huge suv like the sequoia- then that is the way to go. The sequoia is nice, but it too high to get into. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Due to an upcoming move to upstate NY I needed to trade in my 2006 VWPassat for a 4-wheel drive vehicle. We were looking at 4-runners, Honda Pilots and Suburu Outbacks. I originally felt that the Highlander looked too much like a van (from the inside) and did not even want to test drive it, but after a week of looking around I agreed to try it. Needless to say it was a fabulous test drive and I could not be happy with the ride of the 4-runner or the Honda Pilot. The Outback is a great drive as well but for the money you get a lot more vehicle with the Highlander. I have had it for a week now and my husband and I both love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2008 Highlander drives like a car but has a good high seating position. I was surprised by the amount of power I get from the V6 engine. Loaded with 5 adults and 2 children it didn't hesitate on hills at all. Very comfortable inside. Love the automatic rear door. Mileage has been about 21-22 MPG in mixed 70% freeway and 30% city driving. Interior cargo room is adequate with the third row folded though I have a Yakima roof box for long trips or when using all three rows. That was my trade off for not getting a Suburban for the few times I really needed the extra space inside. Ride is a little soft but that may be because I was used to a truck and 15 MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT> Purchased the '08 Highlander FWD on Thursday. Very solid and well built vehicle, with a powerful V-6 engine and well matched 5 speed automatic. The interior is upscale and flawless. I also have a leased '05 Sienna van, and the ride is very similar. I noticed the power steering is slightly overboosted, and could give a little more effort and road feel, but that is the nature of the electrically assisted steering, as opposed to the older hydraulic power steering. As noted by others, the liftgate is on the heavy side, and requires some effort to close. My Sienna has never been back to the dealer, I do my own oil changes and brake pads (very easy), and I expect this Toyota to be as reliable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We were wanting to buy a Chevy Tahoe, since it was more plush and quieter. I could not justify the gas mileage on the larger Chevy. The Chevy lacked many refined details available in the toyota. Rear back up camera, well designed interior, and overall attention to detail compelled us to buy Toyota. I am not complaining about the gas mileage, overall it's right at 21 MPG. The automatic rear hatch door is just fantastic. Althought the factory JBL speaker are ample sound for most people, I upgraded aftermarket by adding a more powerfull amp. I have also been critical of road noise. Not that it's loud on the highway, but it certainly could use some improvement in insulation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Hey Highlander lovers, after trading an Avalon 05 for a Rav4 08 in October, I realized that after 3 months, I wasn't as happy as I missed the features I had on the Avalon and traded for the Highlander. The Highlander Limited AWD 08 is a perfect SUV for me, and I love it ! The interior space is large enough for me as I am 6'2. The leather seats are very comfortable, and I love the instrumentation on the dash. I enjoy the lighted cup holder feature for night driving. It has a very smooth, quiet ride, and the Blizzard Pearl color looks fantastic on the SUV. The navigation is much easier than the Avalon, as it has a touch pad. Before you buy your next SUV, drive a Highlander. You will love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this FWD Highlander for less than a month. I have about 2300 miles. Traveled a lot over Christmas and several trips from Fairfax, Virginia to Duck, NC and Virginia Beach. Surprised that the in town gas mileage is better than the EPA rating. Even on the first tank in town when the HL had less than 50 miles on it, the mileage under bad circumstances was over 19. Commuting to metro and in heavy traffic, I've done about 22 average on a tank of gas in town On the highway, I have been for times as high as 27.6 MPG, but my best tank average was about 26 with 25 being more common so far. Still, that is better than the EPA rating, and I'm traveling with I-95 and I-64 traffic at 75+</TEXT>

It seems when you try and use the electric window switches the handle gets in the way. Try it you'll see what I mean. I have a 2003 Highlander and it rides better then this 2008. This 2008 rides more like a truck with the 19" wheels. All in all I think it's one of the best out there. They just have to twik it a bit. Also, it's bigger than my 2003 which I think I like, I'll have to get use to it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Toyota for under 30 days, I had been looking for a smaller SUV for over a year and had test drove everything from the Cadillac SRX to the Acura MDX, and at the end I finally narrowed down my options to the Toyota Highlander. The Highlander without a doubt has proven to not only be a more spacious vehicle, the new body style is awesome, looks almost like the 08 Lexus LX570. It has a sound ride not to mention how many mpg I get in the city (15-17) and (18-19) on the freeway. My kids absolutely love it and I love the fact that the 1st oil change isn't until 5000 miles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Having owned the 2005 Highlander, I find the redesigned model to be better handling, more powerful, smoother transmission, and vastly larger feeling inside. Being our family vehicle, I found the 2005 model to be basic transportation but nothing special to drive. The 2008 model I actually enjoy driving and find it has some level of excitement, as well as far more practical access to the third row seat. Mileage has been slightly better than advertised 24 vs 23 on a recent highway trip. Found very comfortable on a long distance trip.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Took advantage of the low lease rates offered by Toyota in December, leasing a Base AWD with just a few options including rear air. Did not need anything fancy, but wanted something for my wife that would seat seven without the size of a minivan. The ride is smooth, quiet, and comfortable. The engine/transmission is powerful and well matched. Initial quality appears high, though I have owned the vehicle for only two weeks - time will tell. Although amenities on the base model are fairly minimal, it has the basics including cruise, tilt, decent radio, and some great features. The layout of the dashboard and instrumentation is very attractive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a new Highlander after previously owning 3 other Toyota full-size SUV's..a 1983 Landcruiser, 1993 Landcruiser, 2002 Sequoia. I wanted a smaller, more manueverable, more fuel efficient, but still comfortable car. I also needed the ability to carry seven passengers for short periods once in a while. I am delighted with the car so far. I have had it about a month, and have put about 1500 miles on it. I bought a fully equiped Limited model, including nav system, blue tooth phone, both front and rear auto A/C.

<TEXT>Traded in a 2003 Highlander for the 2008 Sport. We have only been driving it for two weeks and we love it. It is a great car for the price, practical, quiet, looks great in and out. Nice upgrades compared to the 2003 for few dollars more. Accessibilty is great w/ large doors, rear window can be lifed. The ergonomic is great, buttons and controls are w/n easy reach where they should be. I highly recommend it for young families in need of a practical yet comfortable SUV. The rear is spacious for cargos w/ 2nd and 3rd row folded.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased the vehicle a week ago. The engineering is very good, amazing to think they could pack in as much in such a small vehicle. I was concerned about the gas mileage but now after about 600+ miles seem to be averaging 21 to 22+ mpg. It is fast and if you drive it like a race car it will only get 16 to 17 I am sure. I still have not had a chance to read all of the instructional info but believe once I figure it out it will be a blessing. The hands free blue tooth is great. The leather and interior is as nice as Mercedes and more higher end cars. My wife had some problems with the smart key etc. in her first foray driving about 400 miles. She got pulled over going over 80 mph.</TEXT>

Sport model has firmer suspension than all other Highlander models which is why I picked it. Have pushed this car hard in turns and while it leans, it won't give up grip. Quiet and smooth on the highway. After 3,300 miles, I average 21 mpg overall. Seats are comfortable with plenty of room (3rd row only for small kids). V6 has great pickup and smooth shifts. Stereo is fine. Navigation system is a flop -- not intuitive -- buy a Garmin instead. Have owned Toyota/Lexus for 20 yrs. Great overall reliability.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had Toyotas before and been very pleased. I've had this Highlander for about five months and have serious misgivings about having purchased it. I'm reminded of this everytime I have to use two hands to push down the back door.. it's very hard to close. It's been many years since I've driven a car with a noteciably poor transmission but when starting off going down hill (which is how our drive is situated) this transmission is rough. You can see the RPMs reving then hear and feel the transmission catch up. I took it into the dealership but they claim that is the way it is supposed to be. I've never had a problem with a car until I bought this Highlander and really wouldn't recommend it</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior styling is pleasing. I must sound like a grumpy person but that's not the case. This is the first time I've been displeased with a car purchase and I'm finding that it is deeply disappointing and constantly annoying.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just got my 2008 Highlander today and I'm very excited! I traded an Audi A4 and have never had an SUV. I drove a lot of the smaller SUVs: CR-V, Santa Fe, Rogue and Rav4. None of those got me excited. Then I discovered the base model Highlander is in the same price range as the higher end models of these smaller SUVs and ROCKS compared to the others. It's like night & day. I did have to sacrifice some of the fancy gadgets that I may have been able to afford on the others, but I felt it was well worth it to have a car that I really loved inside and out. The base model Highlander is very well equipped for those on a budget and the gas mileage is about the same as the smaller SUVs. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove an HL in 06 and liked it but decided to wait. When I saw the pics for the 08 I knew it was time. What an improvement! I have had my HL for 3mo now. I wanted luxury with utility and the Limited fits the bill perfectly. The EPA ratings seem to be accurate. I'm getting 22 mixed and 27 hwy @<65mph and 25 hwy @>70mph. The seats are very comfortable at first, but start to feel hard after a couple of hours on long trips. People have complained about the head rest, I find their position to be perfect and comfortable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Toyota and I wanted an SUV with more reliabilty and better gas mileage than my 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee. This vehicle is perfect in size and the 3rd row seat is great for short trips with more than 5 adults. I like the styling and features of the LTD. However, the front seats are not padded enough to be comfortable on long trips and the gas mileage is disappointing. I have driven 3,300 miles and have average 15 mph in city driving and 19 mph on the freeway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Toyota. I started with the ever reliable Corolla that I had for 12 years and 120,000 miles until I passed it on to my niece. Then in 2001, I was one of the first to buy the newly introduced Highlander. It was an instant love affair. I've had it for 6.5 years and it just hit 96,000 miles. It has had very minor problems or issues. I decided to upgrade to the 2008 even though the new design hasn't grown on me as quickly. I am also finding the "electronic" steering is taking some getting used to and I can really feel the changing of gears in this vehicle much more than my old highlander. I am not totally in love with my new highlander but I am hoping it's just the transition.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A month and 1800 miles + and we love our new Highlander. The wide luxury ride took a little getting used to after a 95 GMC Jimmy and an 89 Pathfinder but it is a pleasure to drive especially on longer trips. I do not find any discomfort in the seats. Controls are well placed, interior design is good. Features seem to be well thought out and well placed. This is the first "luxury" vehicle I have ever owned and I think I have spoiled myself. Not an off road vehicle but I expect it to be good in bad weather. Love the nav, rear dvd for the kids, and aux input on the stereo for the ipod. The visibility seems excellent and I am expecting same Toyota quality I had in my Fav 84 Celica. Very happy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2008 model is largely improved in size, horse power and gas mileage. 4x4 runs very smooth. Three-zone AC is better than Lexus I have. To really enjoy the car, you?d better have new technologies such as voice controlled GPS, blue tooth and MP3 build-in. That means you must have navigation option. I think it cannot be called GPS option. It is a command center. With the screen, you will edit your phone book, select music from MP3 list, or check who is calling when your cell phone is ring. The new device let me thinking to sell my wife's 2004 Lexus and get a new car with similar device.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We wanted to graduate out of our wagon. Our decision came down to Mazda CX-9, Hyunda Veracruz, and the Highlander. The Veracruz seemed a little more luxurious, but we were hesitant about reliability/resale. The best part about the Highlander is that there was nothing in the "con" list except maybe initial price. But take into account resale, and that goes away.</TEXT>

It is comfortable, quiet, and for a vehicle of it's considerable size and power, gets really good fuel mileage. We got every option except for the nav, and the rear seat DVD. We have portables of both, and didn't see the need to spend an extra $4k on just those 2 options. Excellent up front storage capability with a glove box almost big enough to fit a desktop computer. Comfortable, versatile, and economical, everything we wanted, combined with Toyota's bulletproof reliability reputation. Our first Toyota, and we're hooked.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 2005 Highlander for a Classic Silver Metallic 2008. Love the new looks! Very happy with the improved braking, steering and overall power. Love the convenience of opening the rear hatch window. The ride and suspension are not quite as smoothe as my 2005 Limited was, but this is a sport suspension and the car now has 19 inch tires and larger base. The new Limited felt about the same to me, so I went with the sporty look and happy with it. I love the layout of the new controls, large and easy to find everything. I miss the armrest. Even the door side is too low to rest an arm on - I am 5'5". Rear backup screen & the sensors I added are nice to have. Overall, thumbs up!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been very happy with this vehicle. It has many nice options and is quite comfortable. The ride is very smooth and I like the overall design. I'm not quite as happy with the gas mileage as I had expected in my stop and go trip to work, I'm lucky to get 17 or at best 18 mpg. I'm very pleased with the interior upgrades that come with the limited, the materials are as nice as my Navigator and nicer than my former 4Runner. I'm not thrilled with the steering, a bit soft. And heavy accelerations isn't well accepted by this transmission...over-revs and down shifts too hard. In regard to the steering and acceleration, I'd take the 4Runner any day, but overall other features make it even.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always driven Toyotas, and traded in my Avalon for this SUV. To think that I was considering another SUV - really crazy. I'm a single lady, and wasn't too crazy about the styling of the 2007 Highlander; looked like a family car. But once I saw the 2008, I was totally surprised. I have owned this car for 1 week and 1 day, and anticipate keeping it for a long time. Great comfort, great gas mileage, and a fun car to drive. The 2008 is indeed larger, and carries on the Toyota legacy of being a top quality vehicle. And once you drive it, you won't need to test drive anything else. Worth every penny I spent.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The wide seats and the overall space in this vehicle. It's wonderful. Great looking car also. It handles beautifully. The dashboard lights are night provide for good visibility. And the small blue light that highlights the gear shift in the middle is a nice surprise.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We love our new 2008 Highlander. We were looking at the Honda Pilot but are very glad we went with the Highlander. Gas mileage is what you would expect for an SUV of this size but better than stated by Toyota. Living in the mountains I have used the downhill assist and it worked great. We also like the ability to switch to manual shift. It will come in handy this winter. Haven't used the snow button yet but will probably use it quite frequently this winter. We went with the base because the price of the additional features wasn't worth the extra money for us.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I gave up my sports car for this SUV and have few regrets. I sacrificed tight steering and handling and quick start off the light for a quieter, smoother, roomier car for me and my family. In retrospect, I should have done this a long time ago. The cargo space with easy fold seating is great for hauling away moderate cargo. Even though it is higher off the ground, it's so much easier to put the baby seat in the second row. The leather bucket seats in my old car were difficult to get in and out of. The AWD is great. My RWD car was slipping all over the place. Looked at Tribeca, Pathfinder, Enclave and Tahoe, but this one felt right for me. Good price and good size.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As a man who has had 5 hip replacements and two knees, and was very happy with his two Odysseys, I was interested to look at the '08 Highlander. What scared me off the CX-9 was no Mazda store in town, and questionable reliability.

The styling is outstanding, everyone knows Toyota's quality, and the mileage has been good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been looking for cars and reading their specs for 8 months. I decided to wait for the 2008 Highlander and the Nissan Rogue. Although I loved the Rogue my husband complained that his knees/legs hit the center console! I needed these things in a car: comfort, good economy for the vehicle size, takes regular unleaded gas, enough instant pickup to get on the freeway, decent warranty. The V-6 offers as much power as did my V-8 Mountaineer. I am averaging 21 mpg so far. The comfort is not the best but better than most short seated cars in this price range.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Big car feel but still quick to handle. I like the heavy looking style. Great brakes. Good driver visibility. Heated seats, back up camera are great features. Display screen offers current MPG and miles left on the tank. Full sized spare. You can "shift" this automatic for great mountain driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I were looking for a new crossover SUV and it came down to the Ford Explorer and the Toyota Highlander. We just bought it last weekend. I chose the Toyota because my previous experiences with their vehicles have been very positive, and I perceived the Toyota to be a better value. The looks are stunning, it rides like a Lexus, and the build quality is superior to the Ford's. If you drive her easy, you can easily get 25 mpg city/highway (not bad for a 270 hp, 5000 lb vehicle). We also needed something that would last us 10 years or more, so I gravitated towards the Toyota. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I only have owned for 2 weeks, but this vehicle has surpassed my expectations. I researched and tested Acadia and Mazda CX9, however, based on the features and looks of the Highlander, this was my choice. I am hoping the maintenance and cost of ownership of the Toyota reputation is valid with this vehicle. I have received many "thumbs-up" gestures from older Highlander drivers. I chose the Sport with a lot of extras. Would have been easier to deside if a greater selection of Highlanders were on the lot, but I am thrilled with the color and vehicle I ordered.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far this is a great vehicle. Great power and gets 24.4 on the highway. The base has the standard features but when you are used to a loaded Toyota you do not realize how many options you are missing until you leave the dealership. No power lift gate. Takes two men and a small boy to pull it down. No outside temp gauge. Manual cloth base seats are not all that comfortable on trips. No blue tooth, no hitch, though you pay standard for the prep. I guess they drilled some holes in the frame for you. You cannot buy a hitch yet. No body side molding. I see numerous door dings in the future. Multiple blind spots. Need to add the convex mirrors in the corners. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am enjoying many wonderful features of my new Highlander. However, I am learning that I was more spoiled than I realized with my Tahoe. Seat comfort on long trips is an issue. There is much more road noise than I have been used to. Would undercoating possibly diminish the noise factor? I attempted to get tires that might be quieter. Due to the size, the tire store owner could not locate options for me with three of the main manufacturers and he did not pursue it any further. Other than that I love not needing to fumble in my purse for the keys all the time. That's great when your hands are full.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the smart key option for entry and exit with the quick lock on the outside. I like how the dash is arranged - reasonably easy to use without taking your eyes off the road to an uncomfortable extent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Recently purchased the Highlander. It is a great SUV. Very roomy, high quality interior. I'm over 6 foot and have plenty of room in 1st and 2nd rows. Suspension and steering could be slightly more firm, however neither is anywhere near as bad as some say. Doesn't handle compared to CX-9, but if you want a great overall package make sure you test drive the Highlander. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car three weeks. I loved the car so far. It came with nav, Bluetooth that connected my cell phone in 2 steps, 4 CD changers that can play MP3 and WMA so you could burn about 130 songs in each CD. It also came with full screen back up camera and a stereo input for iPod or MP3 player. The ride is very quiet compared to my 2001 4Runner. This is the car that has all the leading edge technology.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I took delivery of my silver '08 Highlander Sport with 4wd in August. After three weeks and 300 miles, I have the following, admittedly small, reservations. 1) The steering is too light and doesn't offer enough "feel" of the road. 2) The interior uses some cheap-looking and cheap-feeling plastic (probably to keep the Highlander from usurping Lexus buyers). 3) Handling is surprisingly squirrely on the highway (a lot of little course corrections needed) despite the 4wd. This could be a problem inherent with the 19 inch wheels and tires. 4) Driver's side power window switches are blocked slightly by inside door pull handle. Not bad, but enough to be annoying.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This basic AWD model is almost identical in size to our 2000 Merc Mountaineer, but a little wider and way better ride. Interior fan so much quieter. Headlights much better illumination. Not as good looking or as much fun to drive as the Rav4 in my opinion, but we want to tow a 4000 lb travel trailer and the Rav won't quite do it. This Highlander has plenty of goodies as standard equipment. And 8" ground clearance, yet it's easier to get in and out of than the old Mountaineer. My 5'2" wife is happy about that.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just bought a base model Highlander and absolutely love it. The color is charcoal gray, and it came with a light gray cloth interior. However, we worked a deal to get black leather installed. The dealership did an outstanding job with the leather seats, and the end product is phenomenal. The black leather on top of the light gray seat base is a perfect complement to the black dashboard with the light gray lower dash. We recently purchased the 19" wheels found on the Limited and Sport models off of eBay (lucky lucky) significantly cheaper than we would have paid through the dealer. It has such a custom feel now. We just love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The new Highlander is a must see/must drive vehicle if you are in the market for a new SUV. While a crossover by design, it can still tow 5,000 lbs. Yet rides and handles as well as a car. It's a super quiet vehicle and leans to the luxury side of the market. Feels like you're driving a Lexus. More gadgetry than you can learn in a week. I've had it a week now and am still learning. I think the gas mileage is good considering it's an SUV. I get as good as my old 1996 Isuzu Oasis which was a 4 cyl. and there is no comparison as to power. This thing really moves! Quality materials and build. This vehicle is a real winner for Toyota!</TEXT>

Very comfortable, very spacious. Very happy! We were thinking Rav4, Pilot, Outlook, and Highlander and it was a no brainer after a test drive. Limited rode nice, but the Sport is much more controlled, less floaty. Make sure you test drive both before you buy! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was very impressed with the 08 Highlander. The increase in size is just right for me. I was planning to buy a full size SUV but after driving the Highlander, I felt it was the better car for me. So far I have no complaints. The car runs flawlessly and rides very comfortably. I am particularly impressed with the mileage. I am getting between 19 and 21 mpg. I drive a combination of city and hwy. My trips usually exceed 10 miles. This car is especially quiet, I hate a noisy car!! This factor along with Toyota quality and reliability played heavily in my purchasing decision. I came out of an 05 Avalon and the Highlander seems to be quieter than the Avalon. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Drove the Lexus RX and GMC Acadia - dollar for dollar the best of the group. Interior build far surpasses the GMC product and is similar to the Lexus in build quality. Standard V6 provides good acceleration with AWD providing good traction in wet road conditions. Second row seats fold down easily providing amble room for hauling miscellaneous items. Sound system includes six disc CD changer, MP3, and adequate speaker support. The dashboard is perfect with attractive well thought-out design. Good head room, leather seats provide good lumbar support. 19 inch wheels add a great finishing touch to what is a great redesign of an already proven intermediate size SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased our 2008 Highlander Sport model. It has everything our family needs. I love everything about this car. The roomy interior, the versatility of the stow-n-go center seat/console, the flip down third row when we need it and the large cargo area in the back when we don't. It has the rear back-up cam which is very cool, the built-in antenna in the windshield and the pop-up rear window. We test drove the 2007 and this 2008 is so much bigger, inside and out. I really like the masculine look of the car and the comfortable, quiet ride, which is Toyota's trademark. We'll be keeping this one for a long time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow, what an outstanding SUV. We were looking at getting the RAV4 and decided to test drive the Highlander. We purchased one shortly afterward. Very nice turning radius. The engine has significant power for only being a V-6. The interior of the Limited is very nice. Very comfortable, lacking in leg support for the long trips though. For an SUV the fuel economy is outstanding at around 21-23 MPG average. We have put over 1500 mi on it in 3 wks and every trip is a blast. Definitely recommend the Sandy Beige color.</TEXT>

Drove Mazda CX-9, Murano SL, Dodge Nitro R/T (my wife's choices as this is her vehicle). She picked Salso Red with Nav, DVD and everything but remote start. She loves the HL over the Murano and the Mazda's front head rest would not adjust and hurt her neck. The outside front and back looked great to her, the side view is very bland.

After one year, I couldn't be happier.

<TEXT>Some well conceived refinements make this iteration of the Highlander darn close to perfect. A slight increase in size and improved exterior styling eliminate much of the stodginess of its ancestors. The standard 6-cyl engine is more than adequate for a vehicle this size. Like other Toyotas with this 269hp motor, mileage will vary GREATLY depending on how the individual drives the vehicle. The third-row seat has been made more usable with the capability to change the 2nd row's configuration. The base model is generally well appointed, with easy to use stereo and climate controls and cupholders everywhere. Seats are comfortable, but I covered the standard gray cloth with tailored seat covers.</TEXT>

Very comfortable, gas mileage is decent - about the same as my Honda but this is a larger vehicle and a V6. The V6 is impressive. We took the Highlander to the mountains for the first time and hit a patch of ice unexpectedly and started to slide. It reacted quickly and self stabilized, with the added kinda distracting feature of warning noises. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Surprisingly good turning radius. Very comfortable drive and ride. Thoughtful interior lighting that automatically turns on. Self-stabilizing and AWD.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned this vehicle for about a year and replaced an 05 Pathfinder. This has more power, handles better and gets better fuel economy. The only thing I don't like is the hesitation on acceleration. I didn?t notice it much at first but now I realize that when I round a corner and push on the gas, it takes awhile before it responds. You need to be aware of this before you purchase. The other strange part was adding a towing package but not getting the hitch. I found an aftermarket that works great. This is one of the best all around vehicles I have ever owned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned the Limited AWD for about 3 months. Gas mileage low 18.1 high 27.2. Average since purchase is 21.5. Excellent mileage on long trips. Like the size, not too big or too small and the step-in height is also very comfortable. Reminds me of the size of my old 1998 Explorer but nicer in every way. Engine louder during warmup, very quiet thereafter. Smooth ride, quiet interior, and good gas mileage for its size (mid-sized) were my top 3 requirements and it has lived up to my expectations thus far. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only been driving the Highlander for about a month, but so far I'm very happy with it. I'm amazed at how good the gas mileage is, especially considering how much power it has. Even better gas mileage than the 05 Highlander that I traded. I bought the 2 wheel drive model not only to save money, but also because its better on gas, and requires less maintenance than the 4 wheel drive model. My only real complaint is the 55 series 19" tires that come standard on the Limited model. The 19" wheels look great, but one good look at the Bridgestones tell you that they're not well suited for snow or ice. I've already purchased 4 Blizzaks and alloy wheels for the winter months.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in 2007 Toyota Prius with 24,000 miles and purchased new 2008 Base Highlander with max out options. We got great gas mileage on Prius avg on 24,000 miles was 45 MPG. Great car just not the car I wanted to drive in the winter in CO. We have driven the Highlander only 3,279 miles 80% city 20% highway. Average 19.9 MPG. High of 25.6 in the mountains and highway and low of 17.7 in city. This a average 16 tanks of gas. That is 165 gal of gas on 3,279 miles driven or 19.9 MPG. I'm happy having much more extensive comfort and control on snow covered roads in the winter. (No Buyers Remorse.) </TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned everything from rice-cookers, german sedans, 911s and F350s and this 2008 Highlander is the best blend of utility, speed and comfort in any car I've driven. Needing 5000lb towing for smaller farm duties, grinding out daily one-hour commutes with speed and good gas mileage (18.8-21.0 depending on driving style) and great 2nd row passenger leg and head room (I'm 6-2) no one in the family is complaining. Bought the Base AWD. Added leather and tow hitch. Still almost too nice for utility work. Toyotas should hold up quality-wise. If it does, this one will be with me until one of us take a rest!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Passing-power, 5000lbs tow capacity, interior space 2nd row, usable 3rd row for light traveling, new body-style compared to 4-Runner, gas mileage (you will get at least 17mpg if you really pound it). Low cost of maintenance.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It took a while for us to drive a bunch of the SUVs closely resembling the Highlander. Before test driving several vehicles I had already sold myself on an Acadia. After the test drive the obvious winners were the 2009 Pilot and Toyota Highlander. We had looked at the Highlander a couple of years back but it was smaller and the dash was just plain ugly. The new redesign and the plush drive just did us both in. The Pilot would have offered a little more room but the dash looks like its made out of cheap plastic, and unless you get the all black interior the two tone effect was not very appealing to us. We have a family of 4 so we can leave the third row down and use when needed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Look and feel of dash (not a fan of wood so we opted for the Sport model), actual usable 3rd row, MPG in HWY is actually as advertised or higher - got 27-28 on 1300 Mile drive back home from the state where I picked it up, Power Lift Gate, rear view camera.

It is so quiet you get up to speed fast! Response is great and shifting is very smooth. We got the Sport with 2-row seating, and love the generous cargo space in back with storage compartments below and tonneau cover above.

<TEXT>Well, I really liked our 2005 Highlander, but, this 2008 Highlander is simply awesome - really. The exceptionally smooth and quiet ride, powerful engine, and very good gas mileage for the size of the vehicle is without question class best! A recent 1500 mile road trip was the easiest and most relaxing trip I have ever experienced in over 40 years of driving. The sport package handles well, not too stiff, adding to the driving pleasure. This vehicle is the best looking SUV on the planet, lots of "stares" from other drivers. The cabin is very comfortable, controls properly positioned, adding to the driving experience. Toyota cleverly combined features of a sedan, SUV, and minivan! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sport package provides superior ride and handling. The exterior appearance-simply the best! The 440 watt JBL stereo system sounds great.

<TEXT>I've had an immediate problem with strong vibration on cold start. It happened a week after we bought the car. Took it in a month later to service dept. and they were really nice but say nothing is wrong. I've been thru this kind of song and dance with another manufacturer before so I know that the consumer has to stay on top of it. Another concern is lag on acceleration - shifting from 1 to 2 gear. It's like the car has to think about what it wants to do so it pauses. Steering radius (turning into parking spaces) is not great, while driving on highway steering squishy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>As we are only a family of three, unless you count the dogs we tried to fit into a new RAV4. At 6'3"+ it just wasn't happening so we decided to step up a level and are we ever glad we did. As soon as I stepped in and sat down I knew it was just a matter of convincing my wife. That didn't take long either because I let her drive it first. In the short period of time we have had it we have shuttled up to 7 people around, surprisingly comfortably and they have all commented about both the ride and the quiet. I suffer from back problems and the driver's seat seems to sense that, allowing multiple adjustments and the relaxation of variable heat. What a wonderful addition to the family! Try it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior space, smooth and quiet ride, mix of power and decent mileage (20-25 mpg so far), ability to easily change seating configuration.

This is a very comfortable ride with respectable power for what it is. The ride is a little soft but expected for what we were considering which is a vehicle to drive around town on surface roads doing errands. Very nice interior with many features that are in higher end vehicles. Front seats are very roomy and there is a ton of room in the 2nd row both in the large seats and large amount of legroom. Third seat is similar to other vehicles in this class. Cargo room with the third seat up is small as a large grocery trip will tax the space. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I went looking for a sensible SUV and found it. I didn't need 4WD in the area I live in nor do I have kids, let alone 5, so I opted out of the 3rd row seat. The V6 has all the power I need though torque steer is somewhat noticeable. I'm 6 foot, yet there's plenty of room. The center dash/console is so well laid out, I felt as if it was made for me. Steering position is good, feel is a little soft though. Braking is OK, a bit soft as well. Transmission is super smooth, but an extra gear would be nice for a bump up in fuel economy. You may have noticed my 8 rating for economy, I'll explain below.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Snow button. I haven't a clue what it does, but I use it all the time. It feels likes it simply cuts power down.

<TEXT>I bought my Highlander about 3 months ago. Previous to this I drove a BMW X5 and wanted to get something with better fuel economy. I always liked Toyotas but did not like the prevous Highlander. When the redesigned Highlander came out I figured the time was right to get one. My biggest disappointment was the navigation system. First the way it is packaged becomes an expensive option as you have to get the rear seat entertainment system with it. Second, you can only put information in it when the car is stopped which really makes using it aggravating. Third, it is a complicated system and fails to find a number of streets that it should. The system in my wife's Honda is much better.</TEXT>

I didn't really fell in love with Toyota but loved the 2008 Highlander when I first saw it on the parking lot, test drove it and bought it. That was the summer of 2007 and all has been fine till the car turned 8 months old. Now the radio doesn't change volume or doesn't turn on at all in 60% of the cases. When driving away from a stall or at the lights the traction control indicator light blinks and the car doesn't move for 5 to 10 seconds, embarrassing when the light turns green. And the dash on the passenger's side tweaks very very loud. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very silent and comfortable, more than enough power.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Compared the 08 Highlander Limited with every SUV on the market, and overall it was the hands down winner. Awesome looks, excellent power, cavernous interior (a real third row seat for two 6'4" adults), best overall MPG for comparable SUVs, and an awesome vehicle to drive. This is my first SUV and I may never drive a car again! I just keep looking for reasons to get in it and drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A real third row seat for adults; acceleration and handling; entertainment system for kids; navigation system; blue tooth; rear power door; 2nd row seating options; smart key system; automatic rear climate control; backup camera; windows for third row viewing; and many others !! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My husband and I traded in our '03 Accord to get the Highlander. I'm so happy with the decision because it is so roomy but drives like a car. We spoiled ourselves and got the car fully loaded... love it! We live in San Diego but bought the car in Orange County, the one hour and half drive was worth it...the gas barely went down.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Switched to Highlander from Lexus RX 330. Pleased with the design and drivability - comfort is excellent as I am 6 ft, 3 in. Very much like the smart key system and the functionality. Very displeased with the electronics. Satellite radio requires a very expensive and labor intensive installation - I obviously didn't read carefully enough or I would have likely purchased a different vehicle. In order to install satellite radio the dealer indicates that the headliner has to be removed - even a seat removed. WHAT WAS TOYOTA THINKING? The GPS mapping system lacks detail - I live in a city of 40,000 and most of the side streets aren't noted. GPS service on my cell phone is more detailed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased new Highlander Limited AWD about a month ago, primarily for my wife. Interior is comfortable and well designed. Lots of bells and whistles including a great nav system, and JBL sound. Plenty of power, and responsive steering and brakes. Fun to drive, and looking forward to our first long trip. No problems so far. Primarily in town driving so far, and averaging abou 18.4 mpg. Appears to be an excellent family SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Highlander three months ago to replace a Honda Accord. Could not be more pleased. I now have over 4200 miles on the vehicle and MPG for around town driving averages 21.5. I recently took a 1500 mile road trip (mostly interstate) and got 27.65 mpg. Although I miss having cruise and radio/CD controls on the steering wheel and a trip mileage meter these are minor inconveniences. My Highlander handles extremely well and the 3.5L 6cyl flat out gets up and goes when you need a little extra power. A minor irritant is the rear hatch is difficult to handle without using both arms (hopefully I won't require shoulder replacement surgery). Excellent value all around.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The ride and noise comfort is outstanding for an SUV, close to our '08 Camry. It is extremely spacious for 4 adults and the third row seat is very functional. My gas mileage is averaging 21 MPG with little expressway driving. The AWD technology is superior, completely automatic, and provides a reassuring driving experience for all conditions. I have a boat that I tow and the V6 provides plenty of power and the brakes are fantastic. I'm very particular about my vehicles and I'm completely satisfied and would recommend this vehicle to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought the Highlander Limited after a 4 month search of various SUVs. This car is awesome! Lots of space, optional captain's chairs in the backseat as well as heat & a/c, backup camera, keyless ignition, and so many more extras. The powerful engine and 270hp helps make the ride very smooth, and fast. The Blizzard Pearl color w/gray interior was hard to find, but so worth it. Car has more features than the Lexus RX 350, and Toyota reliability is a given. I looked at both luxury and mid-range SUVs, and the Highlander was absolutely the best of the bunch.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After doing a lot of research we purchased our 2008 Sport Highlander just three weeks ago. After two weeks of driving it we started to hear a noise when we would accelerate the car. (Mind you it only has 750 miles on it). Long story short we took it in to be checked out and found out we need a new transmission!!!! We are not happy and now doubt the reliability of our car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Highlander Limited recently after 4 months of looking and test driving lots other vehicles. Compared to the Lexus RX, Acura MDX, Lincoln MKX, BMW X3, MB ML350, and Infiniti FX and EX 35, my Highlander blows them away! Standard equipment includes: back up camera, rear seat change up into captains chairs, easy to read controls, AC & heat controls for the rear passengers, lots of HP, loads of trunk space (w/ 3rd seat down) and regular gas. The Blizzard Pearl color (w/gray interior) is gorgeous, and the ride is as smooth as my husband's RX 350! This car gives you a much better bang for your buck, is good to look at, and is in a class by itself. Try it, you won't be disappointed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We had been researching SUVs for over 6 months and finally narrowed down our choice to the 08 Highlander. Toyota won me over with my 96 4Runner that had 180,000 miles on it and was still going strong! But with 2 kids in carseats the 4Runner was too small in the back. The difference in room is awesome!! I am 5-10 and my husband is 6-2 and we do not feel cramped at all. My husband was skeptical because it looks smaller on the outside than it really is. It is an all around great ride with too many favorite features to list. So far it has been worth the extra dough that it takes to get into a new Toyota. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a Highlander Limited about 3 months ago. My wife is the primary driver and she is satisfied with the purchase but does not enjoy the Highlander as much as her previous Nissan Murano. We needed a 3rd row so we were forced to get something new. Her main complaint is how close she must sit to the steering wheel to reach the pedals. She is about 5' 5" and she sits about 5 inches away from the steering wheel, the Murano had adjusted pedals which allowed her to sit back more. Her only other complaint is how loose feeling the steering is, I personally like the effortless steering, but she prefers a little more feedback from the car. Other then that we are happy with the purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After having my 08 Highlander Limited, I must say it is one of the best I have ever had! After having many Toyotas, I wanted to try an SUV, and I'm so glad! The Highlander has all the luxury I was looking for, and a price at the top of my list. The ride is very smooth and quiet, and the V6 is so smooth and quiet, especially in warm climate. In the winter, it is a little loud until warm up, but that is normal as my Avalon was the same. The Highlander has plenty of room, nice dash, and the premium radio is a must! The bluetooth is great for the cell, and is safe while driving. The navigation is easy, and works well. The Blizzard Pearl is a great exterior color. Great SUV. Awesome ! </TEXT>

<TEXT>When going up small hills the transmission will not shift up and jerks when it does shift. When the engine is under some pressure it sounds very strained. Acceleration is margional.

<TEXT>I stand 6 ft 5 in tall, over 220 lbs and until I sat in the 2008 Highlander the only crossover vehicle I could physically get my legs behind the wheel was an Enclave or a GMC Acadia. The new Highlander layout is comfortable has plenty of knee room and even with the sunroof I have at least 2 in of headroom. As an SUV it has an excellent ride and handles well at highway speeds. Plenty of power and even at 70 mph there is still lots of pep left for passing. Beautiful exterior styling and finish. 19 in wheels improve the looks and the ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded my 06 Highlander (4cyl) in on it because it had been in an accident. We really enjoyed that car; however, it was a base model with no added features. We chose the Sport for all the features. Wow, what a difference! Loaded with creature comforts; quieter, more comfort, power and almost same mpg. Took a 1900 mile trip and averaged 28 mpg at 70 mph. The trip was two adults with luggage. My average in town is 21 mpg (only 10% hwy). We live in Houston so we did not need or want AWD and did not choose the third row seat. We could never find any on the lot and had to order one which was good because it kept all the expensive dealer add ons off.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mileage, 6 CD changer with mp3 and wma. Outside temperature, well lit displays (previous models very poor displays), trip computer, easy to clean wheels and I like the full size spare mounted on the same rim as the others.

<TEXT>I bought an '08 Highlander Sport with AWD in August of '07. It's a weekend car for me, so it has just 2500 miles on it. So far, its been a very good vehicle, solidly built and reliable, just like every Toyota I've owned previously. But I have a few little complaints. First, the acceleration is not what I'd expect from a 270-hp engine, even given the vehicle's weight. Second, the transmission makes me crazy. From a rolling start, the transmission doesn't upshift quickly enough from first to second, resulting in an awkward "pull." Third, the "low tire pressure" warning light is much too sensitive, going on when the tires are just a pound or two low on air pressure. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded a 2002 Sequoia for the Highlander for financial reasons (gas mileage, etc.). I like it, but wish I had gotten the Sport or Limited (none in stock at the time). The base model features are VERY limited in comparison to what I am used to. No exterior temperature guage or interior computer for gas mileage, no power seats, no standard roof racks, no mud flaps, etc. I am dissapointed in the lack of standard features, especially the lack of power driver seat. On the other hand it has more than enough power and drives great. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After having my 2008 Highlander Limited since January, I can tell you that I love this SUV. With its exterior looks looks and Blizzard Pearl Paint, it really turns heads! The gas mpg keeps getting better with an average of 17-18 in city driving.I haven't been on a trip yet, but look forward to seeing the gas mpg. The gas mpg has varied from different post, but I find you can really get great gas if you just take it easy on start and stops. The interior is beautifully done with luxury looks, and the displays are very easy to reach. I have found the information screen very helpful along with the Bluetooth. The engine is very quiet and ride is smooth. Premium radio is a must for sound.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this Highlander Sport a little over a month ago. So far it's great. Fun to drive and tons of room. And the engine is much better than the Explorer or Subaru I used to own. I'm getting just over 17 mpg pure city - no highway yet. Can't wait to see what it is on the highway but if it's at least the 23 they list then I'll be happy. The only thing I don't really like is the EAS - electonic assist steering. It's a little too touchy/boosted. I'd rater have a little more road feel. But it does turn on a dime. I did not get the upgrade to the JBL sound/sun roof/climate control - if you can afford the extra $2000 it is probably worth it just for the sound. Great vehicle overall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far so good with the HL Sport AWD. The back door access to the second row defintely has more access width than my previous Pathfinder. The power is there, but I haven't quite 'opened' it up yet since I'm still in the breaking-in mode. The brakes are very firm, but even with the 'Sport' the steering does feel a little 'light.' The interior fit and finish quality is much nicer than my '05 Odyssey. The backup camera with it's separate screen is a nice feature especially since most of the information that I saw before hand almost never mentioned it. MP3 player with the standard radio setup. I'm hoping in 2-3 years down the road that there will be some nicer all-season tires available.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stowable cargo cover. Backup camera without having a Nav. Aux plug for audio player. Kitchen sink sized glove compartment. 270 hp V6 with just regular 87 octane gas. Second row hold down levers in the cargo area. Rear separate lift glass. DRL can be turn off manually.</FAVORITE>
