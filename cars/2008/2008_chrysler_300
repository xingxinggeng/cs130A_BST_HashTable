<TEXT>After a younger generation of my family totalled my Lincoln LS on ice, I was in the market for a replacement. Drove many of the "reliable" imports: ranging from Infinity to Lexus. Then I drove the 300C. The others are all great cars, but none offered the classic styling and the WOW effect of the 300C, and the power of the HEMI. The car has been great so far and consistently gives 22 to 23 mpg on the highway runs visiting my kid at college. Great comfort, ride and performance to boot! And unique looks to go with it. The interior could stand to be upgraded a bit. You can see where Chrysler cut corners: But still very liveable inside and out. Just wish the exhaust note was a bit throatier.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the HEMI power: 340 horses of them. Interior is very comfortable on long distance drives. Great looking car. After all the years it has been out, it still turns heads!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Quiet, perfect for a 6' person, 400 + mile trips easy, not fatigue. Gets around better than a 4 x 4 truck in the snow. Would be a tank with Blizzak's! Feels like a luxury car inside. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'd been with my car barely a month, but it had been an incredible experience. The ride, the interior comfort plus the looks of the car are second to none. The engine response it fantastic, plenty of power to move the big body. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the gadget inside the car, VES system is great, and the dash board is amazing. Also the Boston Acoustic sound system is awesome.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my Chrysler 300 DUB Edition in July of 08 and this car is a real eye popper. Metalic black with grey leather trim and lots of chrome. Oh, did I mention the 20 inch, low profile wheels? I love the vehicle but here are a few suggestions: Should have auto headlights, heated seats and be able to upgrade the sound system for GPS and auto cell phone. One other thing, it is terrible in snow and ice. I need to install snows and the price is $300 per tire. That hurts.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Body styling, great sound system with the giant woofer in the trunk, paint job, interior is nicely designed and very comfortable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I leased an 05 330C with a Hemi in it. I loved this car and was prepared to purchase it. The car was loaded and gave me zero mechanical problems. When I passed by my dealer to look around at the 08's, I discussed with them the fact that leasing was not something Chrysler was pushing. However, I was directed to an 08 300C Hemi with the SRT design package. It has the standard Hemi, but it's own 20 inch rims, handling package, steering, exhaust and other features from the SRT8. The fuel savings not available on the SRT8 are available on the car I purchased. I love it. Great aggressive styling with multivalve- displacement giving better mileage. Have yet to see one like it on the road.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have my 2nd. 300C and couldn't be more satisfied. Comfort & performance are the best features. Highway mpg is 27- 28, but have seen 30+ many times. The available power is a plus. Only concern is the size of the brakes, needs better stopping ability, otherwise it is the best value around for the money. Huge trunk and ergonomic perfection.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>300 Dream</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I saw the 2005 300 and knew THAT was a car. Once they offered lifetime warranty I felt it was time to get that dream car before they re-design it. I got the Touring V6 as I do not need a Hemi to say I have arrived, or for the thrill of it. I have taken two long trips already and find the car very comfortable and economical. I get around 18 around town and up to 28 on the highway. The AWD is a must in Alaska. Knowing that it has the E-class suspension and 4-matic transmission is very comforting. I hear people think the interior is lacking, but I guess after 5 years of big Ford trucks, it seems quite plush to me. I did get some upgrades that included extra airbags and the blue tooth.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, roominess, power pedals, power heated seats, U-connect for phone, indiglo dash lights, telescoping/tilt steering wheel, smooth ride, plenty of power, solid feel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>To me the car is flawless except for some parts to the interior. Why there is only an off-White headliner is beyond me. Cream or light tan would add so much more class. The total black dash with tortoise-shell accents is great, but the headliner should either match or be contrasted with something softer. The two-toned dash looks off somehow. Also, a body style like this craves darker colors, like maroon metal flake, to show off the lines. Color selection is so limited. Right now, only black looks good enough to buy. The dash could be more 3- dimensional, and not so flat, but the blue glow should stay. You guys are close, though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just put 18,000 miles on a 2008 Impala LT in 6 months and swapped to the 08 300 LX, both are company fleet vehicles and equipped with fleet packages. Both cars are about the same money but the Impala handled much better. The 300 doesn't hold a center line and is very susceptible to cross winds. The Impala had more features, auto headlights, dual climate controls, flex fuel, remote start as standard. The 2.7 motor in the 300 is okay when cruising but it really works on hills. The 300 is roomier and is distinctive looking vs the rental car look of the Impala. The 300 is boring to drive think Buick LeSabre, Ford or Mercury rear drive cars. I would have rather had a hemi and sport suspension!</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Mercedes S to 300</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I own a Mercedes S430 that I drive as a personal vehicle and purchased the 300 Hemi, AWD as my company car. I have driven the car 12,000 miles in the last 4 months and love it. It is as comfortable as my Mercedes and has many of the same features. Had I owned the 300 prior to the Mercedes I would never have purchased the Mercedes. The 300 is just as much fun to drive, has the same comfort level and only lacks some rear seat leg room in comparison. This won't be my last 300 but this will be my last MB S430.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Hemi. I went from an '01 Avalon to this hemi. My Avalon was a little more luxurious than my hemi, but the car handles so much better! It really turns heads!! The Avalon looks so much like the other Toyotas that people didn't know that I had a top of the line car. This one, looks, feels, and is a much better buy. Easy on the eyes and I get as much or better gas mileage as my Avalon. I was a die hard Toyota fan, but this car has changed my mind. I love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Leased this beauty 2 months and 3000 miles ago-compared it to many foreign and domestic sedans before making my choice-have not regretted it for 1 minute. Car is simply amazing to drive, and to look at. Hemi power is as advertised-IMO, much better than the GM 4.6l northstar, or any of the high output V6's. Size is perfect for me and my family of 3 kids. Ride around town, or all day drives are incredibly comfortable. Luxury items like bluetooth, nav, incredible stereo (the 370 watt stereo w/ mygig is just nuts!) I've owned a lot of vehicles over the years-nothing I've ever compares to this. OK, I'm running out of adjectives!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound group 2 stereo w/ nav, bluetooth, and mygig. Hemi power-yeee haaa!!, luxurious interior, overall ride quality, safety features included in protection group 2, glued to the road feel of AWD. I could go on, but I'll stop...</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is styling, profiling - so let's size it up. If you trust the pro reviews, the 2.7 is just too wimpy to swing this bad boy around. Not enough power, they whine. Sure, I'd love to have the Hemi SRT8. But I can't even imagine how powerful that car must be. But there's NOTHING wimpy about the 2.7. It zips and zooms, handles like a dream. So for around 20k, I get a stylish, luxurious head-turner, with Mercedes E Class underpinnings. Sure, everyone THINKS the car is way faster than it is. And maybe that's why the pros dig on the 2.7. It's just not worthy. But I LOVE this car. It saved me from boring large, boring sedanville. Definitely the coolest big boy sedan under 25K!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sweet body styling, superb handling, impressive power - incredible bang for the buck. So far, there's nothing I don't like about this car. And everyone thinks it's WAY more expensive. Maybe I'll just slap on a 300 Hemi C badge from the dealer - who's to know? </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I like the car except for a couple of minor issues. I love the 4/8 cylinder switching. The power is instant when you need it. Too bad the molding was coming loose on the first day we owned it. Also the cup holders are in the stupidest place possible. If you actually put cups (even small) in them you have a hard time getting to the gear shift. The lack of a trash can or even a place to stick one in a car this big is annoying. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine ROCKS! Ride is nice and noise is low</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the base line model after test driving more expensive imports. For the price, it was a no-brainer! If I had known how much I would enjoy this car, I probably would have spent more and purchased the touring model. Still, my car looks and drives like a MUCH more expensive auto; gets good gas mileage with this smaller engine and has been trouble free.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ease of driving; plush features even on the base model, and, of course, it's gorgeous appearance. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had an '96 Avalon & needed new car. Looked at Avalon and 300C. Bought 300C AWD and never looked back. Best decision we ever made! Avalon was NOT the trouble free car made out to be. Took 300C delivery in October, traveled to Fl. in Jan and to the West in Feb. What a road machine!! Went up Interstate mountain roads full 70 mph without any transmission shifting. Never had any vehicle do that. Engine would simply go from 4 cyl to 8. No effort making the climb. Hit snow in some high elev and the AWD had us going when others were having all kinds of fun. Did 70 mph on the level running on 4 cyl! This car brings back the pleasure of driving. Had forgotten how great driving could be. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sheer driving please of a true road machine. * Engine switching between 4 cyl and 8 as needed. * All Wheel Drive. * Satellite Radio. * Road handling overall. * Effortless ability to handle steep mountain grades. * Overall styling. * Lifetime Drive train Warranty. Optional side curtain air bags.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>55 mph=30 mpg 65 mph 27+ 1000 mile trip @ 75 mph and city driving gave me 24.7 mpg very surprising. Last year my pt cruiser got 21.5 same trip. Traded in a 2005 mustang and a Mercedes and we love this car. It is a little of both. 2008 is so beautiful with changes to trunk, rear light and inside. Didn't know it had so many add ons. 0-60 timer is neat. If you can buy the heritage edition, do it! See one and u will understand. The power is terrific. 400 lbs of torque! People's heads screw around versions of this car have been around since 2005. They edge up to look inside. To me all the other competitors look like someone stomped on their hood. Ugly lot! This car makes old fellow like me happy!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth, Nav system with pictures of my family on screen, satellite radio music without commercials, leather bucket seats on Heritage model, fold down rear seats, radar controlled cruise control, fantastic on a trip. Top speed, MPG +, large gauges, 4 cylinder running..can feel it. 0-60 timer. DVD</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Love my 300!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>First, I want to say about the review below; are you kidding me! You're 5'11" and had troubles in this car!!! What other CAR have you ever driven that is more comfortable for you? I'm 6'7" and have NEVER been this comfortable in a car. I usually have to drive full-size SUV's and trucks to be comfortable. Also, loud engine? What are you comparing this car to; a Rolls? My opinion; this is hands-down the best car I have ever owned or driven!! Incredible interior/exterior, performance (3.5 V6), gas mileage, reliability, price and any other category you want to consider. I would have loved to be able to spring for the SRT! But this V6 is wonderful in this car (would not recommend the 2.7).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The whole package! Rear video system for the kids w/ Sirius satellite TV and wireless headphones, navigation, HUGE sunroof, nice wheels, beautiful interior, looks incredible in black, gas mileage, remote auto start, side airbags (peace of mind), HID headlamps, Bluetooth Uconnect, no more characters</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Nicely styled exterior with those narrow windows results in limited visibility that is borderline dangerous. Between the front roof post and side view mirrors...look out on turns. The interior was spacious but bland, with nothing to recommend or criticize too hard. I had the V6, which made the car's interior sound like a truck, and was the noisiest I've driven in years. It did provide good acceleration, and was well matched to the car's below average handling. The engine was not as thirsty as I feared. I got 22-24 mpg in mostly suburban driving. Handling is only adequate - you really have to work the steering wheel, and the car's long wheelbase doesn't help. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling - except for the fact that the same styling means your visibility is awful. Decent car for a limited time period, but I wouldn't want to be stuck with one for several years on a purchase or standard lease</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I myself have 300 touring a 2007 I absolutely love my car. It is a very smooth ride, lots of comfort. I have 2 children that are 6 foot tall and they can ride in my car and be very comfortable. I would highly recommend this car to anyone. If you want style and class as well as comfort, then this is the car for you you.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was very reluctant to purchase an American car after experiencing the reliability of some Japanese makes, but I must say, this car feels extremely well built and it really delivers a superior ride and feel than the Japanese cars I've driven. Even with the base LX, you still get a well appointed semi-luxurious ride with an adequate engine. It's tough to complain about the 2.7L when it delivers gas mileage in the mid to high 20's. I am really impressed with this car and would highly recommend it. If you're looking at any Nissan, Honda, or Toyota in the low-mid $20's, give the 300 a chance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So I went against the preferred engine and really I think the concerns are a little overrated about it. I think if you want performance slapping a massive engine in it wouldn't satisfy my personal preferences. In saying that we bought this because $4 gas will soon be a reality. The car rides incredible, the fit and finish is the best of any Chrysler I have owned by far. The road noise is minimal and the look is just sleek it looks like a much more expensive car. The stereo sounds great and the sets are very top notch. We traded in a Durango and this has more leg room in the rear then our SUV had. I am really pleased with my purchase and the 25 mpg makes me smile.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought this vehicle after being a big Cadillac Seville fan. I was looking for an AWD vehicle and looked at the Infiniti M and Lexus GS, finally drove this one and for about 12k less (based on my final cost) this was hands down the best buy. Interior design and materials aren't Lexus or Infiniti but they are far better than any of the other vehicles I had looked at including the Cadillac. Good ride, will go through anything (within reason), excellent entertainment system, great seats, and one of the few cars that you can get rear seat heaters in. Back seat is comfortable and you actually have leg room. Exceptionally quiet too. The price after rebates and discounts was amazing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Entertainment system, heated front and rear seats (lux pkg), power (gobs), and the ability to go about anywhere in any weather. The fact that you can put a trailer hitch on this, as well. The Dark Titanium is an excellent color addition.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The first six days of ownership were great and enjoyable. Great ride and appearance. Drove the Hemi and 3.5 V6..noticed a heavier fell with the Hemi..but mileage and price for 3.5 was great. Just over a week of ownership, I needed to use the windshield washer and when I hit it, the electrical system died, killing the engine. A immedate release of the windshield washer resulted in a immedate restart, but in a lower gear requiring me to pull off the road. In heavy traffic and at high speed this event could have been a significant risk to us and those that might had been behind us. Dealer has ordered parts yet concerned that circuit board damage was result vs cause. Time will tell.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the appearance of this car and dash display. The ride is a little light but steering is very responsive. Mileage of 3.5 is better than the Camry I traded in.. Life time warranty was sweet..and possible needed in my case.. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is one great car. Extremely comfortable, powerful, fast (I see too many speeding tickets in my future), and it handles great as well. Excellent ride quality and responsive, if somewhat numb steering. Averaging over 20 MPG in mixed driving - and that's during the first 1,000 miles. Upgraded Boston Acoustics stereo is worth the money - makes the car a rolling sound studio. Exceptional build quality for an American car. I personally see no downside to the car, except possibly the gas mileage - but what do you expect from a 5.7L V-8?</TEXT>
