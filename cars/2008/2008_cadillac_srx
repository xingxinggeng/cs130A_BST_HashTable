<TEXT>I get 22 mpg on the highway. My wife loves it and it's the only SUV cross- over that has enough room in the back to really be called an SUV. I'm more comfortable in the SRX than in my truck. It has leg room in the back seat as well. The steering & handling is excellent.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It sets up like a true SUV and it drives truly like a Cadillac.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased a 2004 SRX and loved it. Considered Lexus, BMW, Lincoln, but went back to an SRX. My wife drives this car almost exclusively but when I drive it is a pure joy. Driving from N.E. Pa to Chicago is not a chore but a great experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT>As my lease is ending on my 2008 BMW 528I and after driving both Mercedes and BMW for the better part of 10 years..I decided to go American. The SRX that I bought (not leased) is Black on Black 20"chrome wheels, Vogue grille, Nav, panoramic sunroof and more. It drives like a car and has the room I need for weekend trips to Home Depot. I can't believe that I enjoy this vehicle as much as I do, but it truly delivers the best of both worlds.</TEXT>

<TEXT>There is nothing not to like. I have owned Honda and Toyota for years and thought it was time to 'buy American." This car has needed nothing other than one oil change. Reliability is excellent, despite the reviews. This car is a well kept secret. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a V8 awd with the sport package. The car has 20k miles on it and all I did was change oil (twice). So much for consumer reports saying its unreliable. Love the SRX because it handles like a well designed car and accelerates with ease. Everything works the way its supposed to and this car has been very reliable so far. Drive way better than the V6 trucks from BMW, MB and Lexus and you will save money. Test drive this car before getting saddled to a boring vanilla vehicle recommended by consumer reports. By the way this Caddy does fine off road and in the snow</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love how this SRX handles and rides. I test drove the Lincoln MKX which did not compare to the ride of the Cadillac SRX. I have 6500 miles and drive six (6) hours to my cottage in Michigan. It is a treat to drive that distance now. The interior is gorgeous and everyone always compliments the vehicle's overall appearance. Great job Cadillac. The Bose sound system is like nothing I have ever experienced. I cannot wait for winter to see how it performs with the AWD feature. It is really a fun car to drive. My wife loves the SRX and especially the black exterior I chose.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bose sound system. Automatic (1 and 2 position)adjustable seats. Acceleration. Terrific ride and comfort. Interior is 5 star.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Very spacious vehicle, especially when children are involved. The second row is comfortable and you can comfortably put kids in the back without too much of a hassle. The back compartment also has plenty of storage space especially for long road trips. If you have a bit more money to spend, this suv is a enjoyable lease and purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always been loyal to GM. This time, I purchased instead of leasing so I drove everything, BMW, Volvo, Maxda, Acura and settled on the SRX. I couldn't be happier, the ride is beautiful, the inside "top notch" not like the Enclave which was my first choice after I traded the Buick Rendezvous. Rear seat leg room better than any car I test drove. I am 6 feet tall and the vehicle is very, very comfortable all the way around. The extra seating in the cargo is useless to me so those will always stay down. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The vehicle is very comfortable, handles well, it has AWD so big difference from the STS which he drove for 3 years and I sometimes drove but did not like. (he is now in the DTS)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has it all. It handles like a sports sedan and runs smoothly with plenty of power. As far as mileage is concerned it meets the mfg sticker - about 17 around town and 24 on the road . We have had no problems in the first year and plan to keep it for a long time . Love the way it handles on the road - like a high speed touring sedan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The worst first: this car is the worst car on gas I have ever owned. A friend of mine that has the V6 told me it is just as bad as the V8. 11 MPG! The V8 is very powerful and quiet. Comfortable inside except the third row. Car has a heavy feel but seems to handle well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I had been planning for a Honda Pilot or Toyota Highlander for a while, until we came across SRX at Edmunds.com. We got both dealer and consumer rebates of the month. Now we have it, love it and can't live without it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only purchased Japenese luxury cars for the past 20 years. This was the perfect storm, Lexus and Acura didn't ring my bell. I hate Infinity and I can never see eye to eye with the German companies. I decided to look at the Cadillacs. No way I was buying one, but I looked anyway. The test drive was fantastic. After much internal agonizing, I went back. There were large rebates in play and they had exactly what I was looking for. I pulled the trigger! I have never enjoyed a vehicle more. Wonderful engineering, beautiful fit and finish and a great stereo system. It has it all, size, comfort, power and a wonderful 50/50 weight distribution. Kudos to the new Cadillac management!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system, sport pack, ride and a real nice suspension. The interior feels like a millionaire's living room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm 75 years old, have owned countless cars, and this is the best all around vehicle to date. The Lexus 400h [yes it rattled]was the 2nd worst, which barely beat out the 1974 Chevy Vega. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The whole package looks good, drives good and is just plain creature comfortable. Bought the Sports Package with AWD and 20" wheels. The size is perfect. This vehicle is a little narrower, shorter and lighter than some other large SUV's which is very desirable when driving in congestion.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got exactly what I was expecting when I purchased my SRX. I rented a 2007 model while on vacation and fell in love with it. I got back from vacation and bought one four days later. I bought it fully loaded and do not regret my choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded a 2005 Escalade in on this car. I was very pleased with the Escalade and was hesitant at first with the SRX, but wow. We got the magnet ride, and it can't be better. Cadillac is missing the boat by not advertising this car as much as the others. We tested the Enclave and the Acadia. Go with the Caddy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The V8. Magnet ride. XM radio. Look of the vehicle. Bose. DVD navigation. Electric lift tailgate. The best of everything!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I thought I'd do it ... delve into the American car market .. and I have to say ... what a mistake I made. You pay for what you get and this vehicle I suppose sums that up. Nice on the outside and inside I suppose but the drive and the handling .. appalling. Why is it American cars only drive well on a straight flat roads? Here in Europe we have no such thing and can't you tell with this car. Had an X5 and a Range Rover Sport before .. and now I know why. Nevermind .. it does look nice on the drive .. but that's about it. When will Americans ever build .. a decent car? I love to think they will one day. Well I have to go for a wallow down to the local supermarket now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The SRX handles corners with nimbleness unexpected from a vehicle this large. The styling is classic Cadillac with attention to detail, like real wood grain; solid metal inserts and stitched leather throughout. The Panoramic roof is a sight to behold, gives your passengers the impression that they are in a convertible. The driver is wrapped in controls, but never overwhelmed, everything essential is on the steering column. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, sunroof, little amenities like the heated steering column, multi- positional seat, wonderfully crisp Bose sound system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The SRX is a pleasure to drive. The 6-cyl engine has more than enough power and the car is filled with luxury features. Quality throughout. Better gas mileage than comparable Japanese cars (except for hybrids). Very nice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sunroof, power pedals (my daughter, who has short legs, can now drive at a safe distance from the steering wheel), entertainment options (XM radio + 6-disc cd changer + Ipod connection), luxury all around </FAVORITE>
