<TEXT>My car also is slow to shift from park reverse or drive to revervse. It also has been in the shop five times because something is draining the power from the battery that no one can figure out why. It has been thru two batteries and they put in a whole new fuse system... i drove it three weeks and the battery is dead again. They still cant figure it out so while it sits in the shop i have to borrow parents and friends cars because good ol kia doesn't provide loaner cars and i dont have the money for a rental. All this for a car i've only had four months!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently bought a 2008 Kia Rio and after only having it for two days my transmission went out. There was only around 8,000 miles on the car when I bought it, so i figured it was going to be very reliable...Well maybe I just got unlucky but it made me never want to buy a Kia ever again. Besides the transmission going out, I felt that it was a pretty attractive car(granted I had gotten a black Rio which meant that the tacky plastic trim was not as noticeable). It was a rather smooth ride, but I did feel kind of unsafe in it because it was so small. Besides the transmission going out, I guess it was cute little car...</TEXT>

<TEXT>You don't have to be stupid to buy anything else, but it helps. 100K warranty, low initial price, 35 miles to a gallon endlessly on regular. Smooth ride, great seats with lumbar support, a/c, at, pw/dl, tilt wheel, am/fm/cd/st, spacious trunk, arm rest, power hook-ups, ample head room in back seat for six footers. All this for around $13K. Are you kidding me? Why buy anything else? This is my 6th Rio in 8 years. I still own four of them and all except this one have over 120,000 miles on them and still run strong, use zero oil and get 35 mpg HW. I change the oil myself at 5,000 mile intervals, religiously. Routine maintenance essential. Nobody builds a better car at these prices. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage, low payments, low insurance premiums, head and side curtain air-bags standard, manueverability, ease of access, very comforatble seats, 14 inch tires that don't cost a fortune to replace. Did mention 35 miles to a gallon on regular? What else really matters today? Get real.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After reading the reviews, I am beginning to think the factory forgot struts & shocks on my car. It could be Pennsylvania roads though. My Kia only has 8,000 miles on it, but it rides like a buck board. My 2002 Prism, 103,000 miles outrides it by far. The brakes grab when cold & the delay from reverse to drive is slow. I don't like the cupholders between the seats. They are much more useful located by dashboard. No cup holders in backseat. The window washers only spray a third of the way up the windshield. The gas milage isn't bad...should improve as the car is broke in. Overall, I am looking to trade it in on a smoother ride and I am glad I still have my Chevy Prism. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Rio since Aug '08 and have 17k, and cannot complain at all. I love this solid little car. I driven them all and this one exceeds the civic and elantra's of past. the warranty is excellent compared to the competition. This car is roomy for the size. The trunk has space in it. No complaints, just a little big car for the price with a warranty to back it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Replaced a 02 Hyundai Elantra manual which would have cost too much to fix. I am pleased on how far Kia has come. The car surpasses so many of the past vehicles that I have owned inc my 00 civic. Get the power package, worth the money. No problems on the highway, road noise is low. I love driving my Kia in Bright Blue and passing everyone else, kinda obnoxious and saving gas at the same time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our 5-speed Rio brand-new in August 2008 to replace a gas hog of a truck for commuting over 50 miles a day. The average mpg is 38!Who needs a hybrid? The Rio is surprisingly roomy, comfy, fun to drive, smooth ride, good looking, and the best warranty around. This may seem trivial, but the cup holders with the rubbery grips are the best! Other than a small squeak near the sun visor that has since disappeared, it is flawless. It's a little noisy at highway speeds though. I would totally buy another one in a minute.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So when my 2000 Hyundai Elantra finally had enough and overheated (after 160k miles by the way), I planned on replacing her with a new Accent but luckily shopped Kia before buying it. Same engine, parent company and warranty, but I preferred the more mature styling of my Rio over the somewhat prepubescent look of the Accent. Anyhow, I bought the extended bumper-to-bumper warranty for 10 years and couldn't be happier. My first tank got me 33 mpg and it'll keep improving up to around 5000 miles. Ok, so it's not the fastest ride out there, but it always gets there smoothly and surely. I also like that not everyone's driving it, and that it looks like a mini-lexus if you squint hard enough!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car to replace my first car (1996 Grand Am). I was in dire need of something new or newer as my Grand Am had 200K miles on it and died 3 weeks later. This was the first car I looked at and loved it immediately. This car looks great in black. My Rio's shift timing is a little awkward compared to other cars I've driven, but I'm used to it. I got the red pinstripe on the side and the matching red/grey interior. Mine seems to be the only one of it's kind in my area. The audio jack is welcomed as well as my mp3 player used to run through a tape-deck adapter in my Grand Am. The space given the car size is really impressive. As an art student, I can appreciate the extra space.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The mileage rating of 41 MPG is very over rated and was the selling point for me. However, for a subcompact the car performs well, and even at high speed is quite and handles well. The second big selling point for a sub compact was the quietness of the car. This area outdid the other higher price cars on the lot. The sports package put the extra touch on the inside. All and all it is a good car, but I'm getting about the same with my Honda as far as MPG and the reason I treaded was for better gas mileage, so in the end I lost. Breaks do squeak.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Rio to use as a commuter car to/from work. I wasn't sure I would like it but when I test drove it, I was pleasantly surprised. After 2 months, I just hit 3000 miles and I usually get 33-35 mpg. but did get 38.3 last week on a 3 hr. trip!! I love the way the car handles and it is so much fun to drive. Love the way the rear seats fold down too, so much room. Also, love the way they laid out the instrument panel/radio. Very easy to reach and use, much more than any other car I have owned. I LOVE this car and look forward to it lasting a long time. Highly recommend it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We got the 2008 Rio 5 LX with 5-speed manual. We are very pleased with our choice so far. The car is attractive, fun to drive, and it is good enough power-, handling-, and feature-wise for us. Shortly after break-in, we took the car to TX (1800+ miles each way). Never dawdling, with two adults and two kids, fully loaded with toys and gear, we got 33 mpg. Not bad! It would do better, though, if Kia put a 6-speed in this model. 3500+ revs in 5th for typical Southern and Western U.S. interstate driving is too much. If I often drove on Southern or Western interstates, I would be less pleased with the car. But in the hilly, trafficky Northeast, where I live, I highly recommend it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The overall combination of price, space, performance, safety, and economy are hard to beat! We'll see about reliability, mine's only two months old.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>just bought this car, i had previously bought a 2002 model for my daughter to attend college, never drove hers' much, hers lasted so well, that i decided to buy one for myself, I am overall pleased with mine so far, but motor is a bit noisy when accelerated moderately, and suspension is a bit choppy at times , have just got 800 miles on mine so far, but it getting right at 35 mpg and this beats my dodge ram 1500 14 mpg to death. I believe that i can get used to the Kia small quirks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just recently bought this vehicle as my daily commuter to work and school in an effort to save on gas and help the environment. I'm very pleased with my purchase. The car drives very well for what it is and the motor is surprisingly efficient. The only change that I made is I replaced the air filter with a K&N unit. Would recommend this vehicle to others.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car as a commuter car. It is great. I get 34 mpg combined driving. It is cute, the girls love it. I did not buy it for that though. It made sense to me a good value in a nice package. I drive a lot and was driving a big truck, the monthly payment and gas for this car is cheaper than the gas for my truck. I read many reviews on the internet and reliability is up there too. For a sub compact it is quiet. Lots of features for the money. It has a small engine but has enough power to get me up hills at the speed limit. I'm very happy with it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you're looking for an inexpensive ride that's great on gas, the Kia Rio is all you need! I bought the 4 door base to use as my "run around" car and I am getting 39 MPG based on about a 60% stop-and-go and 40% highway driving ratio. It's the best no frills car out there, easily the best bang for the buck. I never thought I'd buy a Kia/Hyundai, but with gas prices being what they are and just needing some basic wheels, this car hits the target dead on! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>GAS MILEAGE!!! Also, the seats are comfortable, even for a 6' 4" guy like me. I have plenty of leg and head room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my Hyundai Tucson for a car I could use for my working commute. Rio5 SX was a straightforward choice. The car is compact but surprisingly comfortable and spacious. The engine is up to the task considering is a 1.6 L and the car is very fun to drive. In my first tank of gas I've got a good 33 mpg in mix condition (traffic/highway) typical in a commute scenario. Very, very satisfied with this choice that I recommend to anybody in need of a good, reliable commuting car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the design. I went for a SX model with full optional and I think made the difference. The 18" alloy tire, the interiors, the power windows, fog lights, the tire pressure system, the heated mirrors, etc. are all optionals worthy the $1,200 price tag. However the gas mileage is the main feature</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After trading in my 15 MPG American "Tank", I am well pleased with my Rio! The difference in gas price alone amounted to over $200/Mo. which is a good portion of the payment. Nimble, sure, and attractive lines (IN my opinion). I could not be more pleased. I like the fact that I did not have to pay for a useless car alarm either. (I think we quit listening to them about a year after they came out). No bloody power this or that to break either and I can reach the passenger window crank without causing a crash on the freeway</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the car for my wife to drive to work and save money in gas. Best thing I ever did we went from 12 to 14 miles to the gallon in the city to 26 to 28 to the gallon in the city. We cut our gas bill from $75 to $30 per week. I cannot wait to get it on the highway to see how many miles I can get. I also bought the car because I am not a small guy and when I first sat in the Rio I was able to get in and out with out hitting my head on the roof. The space was also a factor and the Rio was a perfect size for wife and me. The interior has enough space to place the 3 kids in the back seat and stuff in the trunk.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has great get up and go! The gas mileage is a wonderful improvement over what I was driving. I've been told it will improve after the first 5000 miles, but already I'm getting 32 mpg around town, so I am quite happy with it. My mom drove it and she is used to bigger cars liked its handling, but said she couldn't ride in it on a long trip. She bought an Optima and loves it. She and I both have more leg room than you could ever want, its very surprising. My dad is 6'4 and he couldn't believe it. I got Automatic with power pkg and I couldn't ask for more for the price just under 15,000.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I just recently purchased a 2008 Kia Rio and traded in her 01 Ford Escape. She is very happy with the car. It cost her about half to fill the gas tank than it did before and she can drive for almost twice as long. The interior is very sporty with black and red stitched seating. My question is Why would anyone want to buy a base model Rio when the price of a almost fully loaded one isn't much more.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the '08 Kia Rio because of the good gas millage and its dependability. I put about 90 miles a day on my Rio and get 35 mpg. It is fun to drive. This is my first car.

<TEXT>I was worried at first, having made the transition from a full-size 4x4 to a sub-compact, but all is well especially at the pump. I average 3-500 mi. a week and this great little car gets 29 in rush hour, and 33+ on the open road. I like manual transmissions and it was pretty hard to find the one I wanted. This little car has some spunk and I really enjoy driving it around. Seats are nice and the controls are well placed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle to replace my not so fuel effecient 07 Tuarus.. My first impression was, solid, tight, peppy though not powerful. I enjoy the 6 speaker stereo and power package with heated outside mirrors. Since Cruis control is not an option, I did some research and found a great kit and had it professionally installed, case closed. I'm figuring Im averaging around 27 mixed city and hiway. I haven't taken a long trip yet but hope to get 35 as the sticker says. I had those gawd awful skinny Kumho tires replaced immediately with some more aggressive BF Goodrich T/As. What a difference in handling, BTW, I'm 6 ft 2 in and it has plenty of room for comfortable driving positions..</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this to replace my 95 Honda Civic. Need a dependable work car for long commutes. Base is no frills, less things to fail or wear out. Love no power steering! So far, this ride is great. Comfortable, solid and classy for the $ spent. ($10K for a brand new ride with a 100K power train warranty.) Does not even have a radio, but is wired for one with speakers. Most folks replace the factory radio anyway, so this is a great approach for a custom ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's roomy enough for four adults, very fun to drive around town, and gets a whopping average 35 miles per gallon (50% highway, 50% city driving.) It's very pleasant at all speeds (never taken it over 80 mpg). What an amazing value! I wish I had purchased a car like this sooner. I listed "Performance" as only a 7 because it's not designed to be a race car. It's a 4-cylinder, therefore performance should be a little sub- par. That said, I've never had a problem keeping pace at a light, or going uphill.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The basic Rio is pleasantly surprising. All is well with it, except filling the gas tank today, I got 30.1 mpg. On the lot where I bought my Rio were signs on some of the Rios stating 44 mpg. Now, I know that is highway miles, and the sticker only said 27 city, 34 highway, but something is amiss here. I am thinking, if I get 44 highway, then I think I should get at least 35 city. And driving it slower than two thirds of other vehicles, I think that should have been accomplished. I am disappointed in the mileage I got for 9.98 gallons, traveling 301 miles. The reason I bought it was for the mileage. But.....</TEXT>

<TEXT>Started driving the base model and it is really easy to manuver. The steering is hard, but got use to having to hold onto the steering wheel at all times. Sporty, nice interior, gasoline mileage doesn't look to promising at the moment, but may get better. Some models they advertise on lot, 44 mpg, but window sticker shows much lower, very much lower. Overall, for the price, you may do better, but the warranty is really the good part. </TEXT>
