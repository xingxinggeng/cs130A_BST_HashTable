<TEXT>Camry is a good vehicle to own and drive. It performs well on good roads. I have not had the opportunity to test it on bad roads, so I can't comment. I would rate the vehicle overall 5 or 6 in a 1-10 scale.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this brand new 2008 LE V6 at the end of 2008. Within a week the seat and steering wheel would vibrate when driving 65-75 on the highway 30 miles to get to work. Also had issues with the bluetooth. Brought in repeatedly. Eventually a TSB was sent out by Toyota regarding vibration/shudder after months of complaining, but it didn't completely resolve the issue. Toyota Rep insists it's the way Camry is designed. Had Honda's for 20 years, first toyota, incredibly disappointed. Do not feel safe. Also experience transmission hesitation as others.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handsfree, when working which is majority of time. Ability to have manual transmission in automatic - great in snow. Comfortable ride, even sometimes when on the highway. Love trunk size, fits everything.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>For what I payed for it you can't beat it. From taking the kids to school practice etc.. the Camry is an excellent car. It is hushed and smooth on the highway. In the city (chicago) it absorbs the numerous bumps with no problem. For all of the people complaining about the performance. IT IS A V-4. If you wanted fast buy a mustang. Perfect everyday car. I am averaging 25mpg. Majority city driving. It is a great family car without the big sticker. Very safe car also. Has 6 airbags standard. Has an I-pod jack with 3 gig of storage for mp3's. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet ride. Great fuel economy. Extremely comfortable everyday driver.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought a 2007 and had many problems, the 2008 is great, they resolved many of the issues on the 2007s. Noisy brakes, dash squeaks, transmission. I have had no problems at all. I do not drive much any more but I am very happy with the car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy on the eyes, good finish, nice fit, reliable (once again). Decent gas mileage. Nice leather, heated seats work well in the cold. Rear window defogger is very good. Nice car all over, excellent ride and handling.</FAVORITE>

Good acceleration, especially for a 4 cyl. I'm 6'4", wife 5'4". We both fit well into the vehicle without problems, even the back seat. Sound system is very nice. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had several other import cars in the past mostly Honda's. This was my first Toyota. I am sure glad I went to the dealer to look. I went in and they had the car pulled up. The car was warm inside and it was like the seat just grabbed on to me. It could adjust several different ways and with the telescoping wheel it felt perfect. We took it around the block and it handle like it was a sports car. I could not believe how quiet it was compared to my other cars I have had in the past. The white outside with the dark leather set it off just right. I have had the car almost a year and I like sometimes to just hop in and drive it still. I would recommend this car to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a 1998 4Runner and finally couldn't deal with the gas mileage anymore, so I traded it in for a top of the line XLE 4 cylinder. I LOVE the looks of this car, however, the quality is terrible compared to my 4Runner. TOO MANY squeaks, rattles and noises from everywhere in the car. I have also had transmission problems, but they have been fixed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had nothing but good experiences with my Camry. No problems with the car itself (only some damage from hail, but nothing to do with the car). It's extremely comfortable and spacious inside. I mostly treat mine like an SUV, hauling a bunch of stuff around and it holds up great! I get at least 25 mpg city and much more than that highway. The car looks great from the outside and in. I have all black cloth interior that holds up very well with everything.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our fourth Camry, but the first with a V6. We traded a 2007 Camry SE I4, and I am not disappointed. The 3.5 V6 is very smooth and powerful. It runs 0-60 and quarter mile times of the infamous 5.0 Mustang from the early 1990s, (in stock form of course). Gas mileage is within 1-2 MPG of the I4. 600 miles already racked up since Friday night.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far after 100+ miles of driving, the Camry has the comfort, quietness and pep that the Camry is known for. There is no question that this car is rock solid. Toyota's quality with the unibody welding rather than the rivets by their competitors will make this another hit for Toyota. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have to say I love this car. I bought one in 2007 and just gave that one to my wife, so I had to buy a brand new 2008. It rides great and shifts smoothly, plenty of power for a 4-cylinder. I recommend getting one with the upgraded JBL stereo. It sounds so much better than the regular stereo. My 2008 Camry has the upgraded JBL stereo, moonroof package, rear lip spoiler and body side molding. I'm looking forward to driving this car for the next few years. This car rocks and I recommend buying one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Camry since 1993. Stuck with the Camry since I've always had good luck. Heard the 2007 had problems with acceleration, but figured they had fixed that on the 2008. Having same problem with 2008 as people did with 2007. Problem is still not fixed and I want to slap myself for not test driving my new car. Once you get on the highway, it rides beautiful, but my ride to work is all stop and go.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car used from a reputable dealer in my area. It was a repossession with 10,000 miles on it. It is loaded with everything imaginable. Leather, sunroof, V6 3.5L, 6 speed trans, and a rare body ground effects kit w/spoiler & skirt. Chrome everything, bluetooth, remote start, fog lights. I absolutely love it. Talk about fast, 0-60 mph in about 5 seconds, and the gas mileage is amazing. The heated leather seats are the best, and the many seat adjustments make my driving experience a pleasure. If I had to buy this car again, I would never go back to a four cyl. car or a car with cloth seats. I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this car to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned 3 Camrys-1991,1995 & 2004; due to satisfactory previous ownership history - I made HUGE mistakes in making this purchase! Shopped all day online-made calls-night-time test drive-purchased car Saturday night. Week later realized-CHEAP BUILD & INFERIOR QUALITY of plastic material of interior, fabric, exposed metal & bolts on floor, downsized & eliminated compartments, eye/sunglass holder, small poorly designed seating-driver, passenger & rear-no elbow room-cramped interior, smaller trunk space, etc. Only 5'4 roof of car close to head. Cheap fabric on seat not sewn-just stuffed inside cheap plastic bucket of seat. Driver seat should be ergonomically correct-miserable drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The "fly by wire" feature has caused an annoying lag when reaching certain speeds. It's almost as if the car can't make up its mind what gear it should be in. It constantly downshift and hesitates. Sometimes the car stalls when I press the accelerator to pass another car. I'm scheduled for Arbitration with Toyota about this problem. Stay tuned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my '08 Camry in Jan. and couldn't be more satisfied. I was a previous 4-Runner owner and loved it so much I became hooked on Toyotas. My main purpose in buying the car was transportation to and from work, about a 50 mile drive per day. I also wanted much cheaper maintenance. Gas was a huge issue too. I now average about 29 mpg with premium gas and 24 with regular on the interstate. I love the interior even though I sacrificed my leather for a cheaper price. Everything is placed just right for a comfortable ride. My installed bluetooth makes the drive even more easy. The whole family fits great inside. Exceeded my needs</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overhead bluetooth, steering wheel controls, cupholders rock, tinted windows, a.c. much better than any other car I've owned as far as features and ease go. Super quiet ride. Easy to drive with lots of horsepower. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>2008 Camry was sluggish and changed gears often. Cruise control varied 5 to 6 mph from actual setting. Traded this Camry 1 year after purchase. Bought it new 9/2007. Since purchase the CD player had to be replaced, did not pass state inspection because 4 struts were leaking. Then a front wheel bearing had to be replaced. This was a very unreliable car so I traded it in. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the car in Feb 08 and traded it in in Sept 08. The hesitation at take offs and the up and down shifting of the transmission were getting on my nerves. It easily cames out of over- drive to get up a small hill. If you did not take off slowly, the car had a dead spot and then the car would take off. A lot of complaints about this issue on the internet. I do 80% interstate driving and I struggled to get 22 mpg. The car rode nicely on smooth roads as well as handled well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the SE because of the styling and expecting about the same MPG as my old 1998 Camry (24/30). I now have 8K miles on the car and consistently get 22 (combined). In my opinion the car is underpowered with the 4cyl. The engine hesitates when accelerating at slow speed and I must be careful when pulling out or into traffic. Road noise is a problem when using the built in blue tooth. I was warned by the Toyota salesman about the poor ride of the SE as compared the to LE, XLE, he was right.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>LE 4dr Sedan (2.4L 5</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>First impression was pleasing. But at 8000 mile had to have to have the transmission reprogrammed. At 20,000 mile the transmission had to be reprogrammed and the windshield washer motor had to be replaced. At 25,000 mile tires were out of round and had to be replaced. The car does not dampen road feel as it at first. Still have tranny issues with over/under sluggish shifting and acceleration, needs the latest up reprogramming. I expected better from Camry. Fuel economy is better than expected on mostly level interstate travel, hilly terrain it decreases 3-6 mpg and really suffers in mountains. Still has a quiet ride and is easy to handle. At speed the passing ability is ok. The center post blocks vision. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Adequate seating comfort, easy reach controls, roomy interior for a midsize sedan. Good air and heating comfort. Satisfactory fuel economy. Better than average exterior styling.

<TEXT>A really good car that really shines the more we drive. Both a good car for in city driving and getting 25 mpg or better with A/C in summer driving. Best on highway was 34 mpg with no A/C in cooler weather. Ultra smooth 6-speed auto trans with the V6 makes a car jump on the highway with a breeze. Just wish had the handling of our previous Acura TL but we love not having to purchase premium fuel. Size is perfect for wife taste and big enough for the 6-2 foot son in back seat. A good buy for us with our needs and hope to keep a long time so reliability was important.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth V6 engine with great transmission. Sunroof is a must and we use our daily. Steering wheel audio controls are nice and Bluetooth too! Keyless option spoils you when you switch cars. XLE rear seat tilts for extra comfort on taller passengers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After two decades of driving SUVs I finally gave in to high gas prices and bought a vehicle with better mileage. I spent way too much time on the internet researching and then test driving different cars before choosing the Camry. After owning my Camry SE V6 for six momnths I have no regrets. I chose the SE because I liked the tighter sport suspension. The V6 provides very good power yet I get an average of 28 MPG with mostly highway driving. Another plus; I'm over 6 feet tall and I fit comfortably in this car. I commute 60 miles round trip to work and truely enjoy driving this vehicle. I don't miss my SUV, if I need a larger vehicle for a day to haul more people or stuff I'll just rent one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm normally a loyal Toyota purchaser, but not sure after purchasing my new 2008 Toyota Camry. Toyota has always had good reputation for great running, reliable car, but the transmission in this car is the worst ever. Like other drivers have said, it's sluggish. Shifts often and hard, especially on an incline and on cruise control. Hesitates when accelerating after slowing down. A nightmare using cruise control when I went on vacation. The driver seat could use more upper lateral support as I tend to lean out of the seat towards the center. I'll keep the car as long as I can and probably trade it in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the V6 version before I realized I would be driving about 40k a year. Although I am currently getting in the high 20s and low 30s for the mpg. I spend about 3 hours a day in the car and it is fairly competent. The driver seat could use more upper lateral support as I tend to lean out of the seat towards the center. The car has a superb ride for a Lincoln or Buick, but I wish now that there was an SE V6 for the stiffer suspension when I bought the XLE . The car is well equipped even better so than the Accord, which I have owned several and think I prefer overall. The Camry is overall a solid car and sure to please the masses.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>JBL audio is awesome. The V6 is thrilling and smooth. I am averaging 27.5 mpg and today on a new fill up I have averaged over 30 mpg which is amazing with the a/c on and that much power.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my 2008 V6 LE since end of December '07. LOVED it as soon as I test drove it on the highway. Comfortable, well designed, best car I have owned to date. In February I noticed the transmission not shifting appropriately - seems to have a delay when I need to start off from a dead stop, also has trouble regulating itself right afterward, shifting late. Dealership says they see nothing wrong. The radio reception disintegrates when the rear window defroster is turned on. Crossed wires?</TEXT>

<TEXT>My family has always owned Toyotas and reliability was always ok but not perfect. When it came time to pick a car for myself after graduating I thought the sensible thing would be to buy a Camry. I was wrong. This car has been nothing short of a nightmare. In less than a year's time of ownership, I now know almost everyone at the dealer service desk by name! First it was transmission problems which have never been completely resolved. A dead battery caused by electrical issues,(not my fault) that left me stranded. Radio died after only 3 months. Exterior paint has not held up well though first winter. Other more minor issues including a tail-light bulb that keep going out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned this Camry almost 6 months now and love it. Got the upgraded LE package to include sunroof, alloy wheels, and a few other little add ons. Love the bluetooth hands free feature. Very good on gas, plenty of power, a little hesitant at times when you step on it, but that is to be expected when driving a four cylinder vehicle. Interior ergonomics are comfortable with all cluster gauges in full view. Exterior has a more aggressive stance than previous models, with aerodynamic lines that compliment the vehicles overall appearance.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the sunroof, has an upgraded 8 speaker radio with built in 6 disc cd player that is phenomenal. Plenty of room for a family of four.

Was told by non Toyota mechanic that it is the torque converter and Toyota themselves say "its a normal characteristic of this car". WHATEVER!!! Pretty scary huh? Could harm me while driving someday. It also shifts hard sometimes and revs up when I am not accelerating. Also, my cd player will play a song or so then stop completely and keep my cd, and won't give it back until the stereo cools down! Other than that, I love the car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car came with a defect in the software governing the transmission. The glitch causes a 3 - 4 second delay when rapid acceleration is needed. This is a safety hazard, and is the reason I strongly advise people to consider a different car manufacturer. Toyota has done nothing to address this issue, which I noticed immediately after driving off the new car lot. I did not test drive this car before signing the paperwork, but instead drove a test model "just like it" which did not have the glitch. The dealership and corporate office have shown an utter indifference, and deny that this is a safety concern. It IS a safety concern, so please consider a different manufacturer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is impossible to give any positive feedback on a car with such a glaring safety issue. Three to four seconds of delayed reaction is a very long time when rapid acceleration is needed. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my RX 300 for this Camry and after a week I'm not disappointed at all, especially at the gas pump. I went from a V6 to I4 and there's plenty of passing power. I also went from leather to cloth seats and it's not cold - no seat heaters needed. If you want more class upgrade to the XLE but get ready to pay 3-4K more. That's a personal choice. It's only been a week but if I have to take it to the shop you'll be hearing from me. I bought certified used (3,800 mis) and the best thing about that is that the warranty is 7/100,00 mi - better than new.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Toyota makes great vehicles. This is by far the best car I ever had. If you drive one for more then a couple of minutes, you'll see and feel the car's Lexus like qualities. The interior and exterior design is very pleasing to the eyes and touch (except for a few cheap plastics in the cabin). The cabin is very quiet on all fronts via wind noise, engine noise, road, etc. Going over bumps is like driving over gentle pebbles. There is no rattles in the cabin just tranquility. Now if you're going to be driving your car like The Fast and Furious, it also does good in that area. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am 18 years old, and this car is the first stick shift I have ever driven/owned and it was great to learn on. The performance is decent for a 4 cylinder, although it could be better. For me personally, the manual makes it blast to drive, but during sharp cornering there is quite a bit of body roll. Despite the body roll, handling still feels fairly secure. Gas mileage is good, I get about 21 mpg in the city. Perhaps my favorite part is the way it looks. The lines of the car are gorgeous, especially in the blue ribbon metallic color. If you want a car that looks good, is good on gas, has pretty good performance AND is cheap (got mine out the door for about 18k) then this is the car for you!</TEXT>

The XLE with leather is very very close to the older model of ES300. I love the blue tooth function. The rear sunshade is also great. Lots of storage room. I do have some issues with the performance. The car wont "go" at the stop sign, and the engine makes a lot of noise when accelerate. Also, the gas mileage doesn't seem to be too good. I average 22 so far in the first half tank of gas. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased a 2008 Toyota Camry CE with the five speed manual transmission and I must say it is truly a pleasure to drive. The clutch has the right amount of travel, the shifting operation is smooth, and the power of the engine is great whether you're driving in the city or on the highway. The fit and finish of the interior is excellent with a lot of shoulder and head room. The seats are also positioned in a way that is very comfortable. In this price range it offers quite a bit. I'm only twenty years of age and I'm impressed with this car even though it is marketed towards a different crowd.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Only had the car for 3 weeks - 700 miles. First tank of gas I got 23.5mpg, second I got 25. Oil filter is a little different on the v6. It is a cartridge element, not a spin on filter. This makes for a really clean oil change. Leather seat with Liquicell are amazingly comfortable. The ride is remarkable - very quiet and noninvasive. Transmission shifts confidently and correctly. It does NOT "hunt" of gears. Camry v6 is really quick. Originally wanted JBL sound until I heard the standard cd - there is no need to upgrade. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Camry meets all of my expectations. It is a solid, dependable, good looking vehicle that has proven itself to be the best value in its class. I treated myself to the navigation with bluetooth capable telephone functions. Combine that with the adjustible heated leather seats, smartkey entry and starting, and the traction control and you have a damn nice car (lexus like) right at $30,000. But, it does not turn heads (although the the new body style is not as soft as previous years). There are a billion Camrys on the road yet I still feel special in mine. It is a safe choice.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Honest Opinion</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>This is a horrible car. All the talk about Toyota quality is really nothing more than marketing-hype. The so-called quality is NOT there. Rather, this car is riddled with many problems--some of which are really serious and dangerous. First, the transmission is really bad. It slips all the time and shifting is very poor. It could cause "unexpected" acceleration, and can cause serious accident. Second, the quality is bad. The gaps between parts (e.g., dash board) are wide and uneven. 1970 Dodge is probably better assembled than this. I've already visited the dealership three times because of various problems. Third, don't expect any fun in driving this car. Steering is very unresponsive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is spacious--but it is probably more accurate to say it is "bulky." While the car is quite large, they didn't use the space efficiently. There is almost NOTHING to like about this car.</FAVORITE>

The Camry im driving is slow, the controls are in poor positions, it handles squishy and rattles. The exterior body styling is ok i guess, but this car is so vanilla and so ho hum its hard to recommend it.

<TEXT>Trade-in time for 2003 Toyota Camry LE V6 we really liked except for a known Camry feature - choppy transmission. Put together a features list, studied sedans/SUVs over 18 months. It came down to test driving 3: 2008 Camry LE V6, 2007 Honda Accord V6, 2008 Ford Taurus SEL. After driving the Taurus there was no comparison. It blows away the Camry. Better price too! Camry handled very nice but research/Toyota service tells us that the transmission hasn't changed. Camry's small inside compared to Taurus. Taurus is actually competing with the Avalon which it also blows away! Camry interior is cheaper/less attractive than our 2003 was. Toyota; while you were sleeping - Taurus came along!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Toyota makes a solid vehicle--this is not news. The 08 Camry SE is large enough to be comfortable but still a nimble performer. Keeping true to Toyota form, the interior is closer to spartan than luxurious. It's well-laid out. Controls are easy to reach and more or less idiot-proof. The 4-banger has enough power to safely merge onto a busy highway or pass a fifth-wheel on a 2-laner. Its lines are clean, but a little ambiguous in light of the Accord. What the Camry lacks in a clear identity it makes up in its overall build quality. All in all, a great car. Won't turn many heads, but it also won't make your head spin at the gas pump. </TEXT>

<TEXT>As usual, with so many cars out there today, you cannot see your blind spot with the camry. Even if you turn your head to the left, out of a total of 180 degrees, you will only be able to see about 45 degrees. With my old 00 Corolla, you could turn your head and literally look down the street in the left lane. With the new camry, you cannot - you must use your mirrors and buy a blind spot mirror; and using mirrors is dangerous when making split second decisions - you simply can't see down the left lane with this car - obstructions block it. Dangerous car. Its a very, very dangerous car. I almost got into about 5 accidents already with it on multi lane roads/highways. I want to get rid of it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a 2007 Toyota Corolla LE and I was very impressed with it; however, my grandparents needed a vehicle, and it was easier for me to get a car. So I "upgraded" to the Camry. It sits a little lower to the ground, but the ride is smoother and there's so much room! The power driver seat is nice, audio controls on the steering wheel are convenient. I don't mind the plastic dash, but some don't like it. I've read some criticism of the look of the 07 and 08 Camry, but I think the "bulbous" nose is actually cute.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car, beautifully equipped with all the creature comforts you can want. As for economy, I'm beating the revised EPA MPG estimates by +4MPG in the city (25 vs. the 21 Estimate) and by +3 MPG on the highway, (34 actual vs. the EPA 31 estimate!). Beauty, styling, luxury and great gas mileage... I love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 1 month and 1,000 miles I would have reservations about recommending this car. It looks great, and is overall fun to drive. The navigation, sound, and bluetooth operations make the car easy to drive. The interior is roomy and looks great. When merging into traffic on the second day of owning the car, I almost totalled the vehicle as there was NO response from the engine after pressing the accelerator. This happens constantly. Check nhtsa.gov for current reports. The dealer doublespeaks the issue. I also had defects in the paint that resulted in a repainted bumper. A taillight also didn't fit and required body shop work to fix.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>JBL sound system with navigation, plasma cluster, odometer lights and screens, interior look, exterior 2007 redesign, rear window shade - even if it is manual.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I can not complain too much at all. When you buy a Camry, you know what you are getting... a quality built, reliable vehicle. In 2007, Toyota redesigned the Camry to make it one of the most appealing vehicles on the road. I have had an issue with the driver-side seatbelt not wanting to click, but I am willing to write that off as an anomaly, assuming I will not have any issues getting it fixed by Toyota. I am only getting about 22 mpg, which falls into the lower end of the ratings. I would like to see at least 25-28 mpg. We'll see. Light from dash/radio is too bright at night. It is like someone is shining a flashlight in your face.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>JBL stereo, exterior design, steering wheel controls, sporty feel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've driven my 2008 Camry LE 1,375 very pleasant miles so far. It is very comfortable, roomy and fun to drive. Fuel economy is excellent. The 2.4L 4cyl 5A has plenty of pickup when needed on the highway. I would recommend this car to a friend. </TEXT>
