<TEXT>This is my 5th VW, and I have to say I'm quite impressed with this generation, especially the 2008-2009 with the 170hp engine. The Rabbit offers a GREAT value when compared to it's competitors. Where else do you get 170hp, a slick interior, climate control, power everything, alarm, etc, starting at $16K!? The answer is nowhere. It's no wonder the Rabbit, and it's high performance brother the GTI win nearly every compact car comparison. People who complain about the gas mileage are comparing it to 4 cyl cars making 100-130hp and very little torque. This is a 5 cyl making 170 hp and 177 ft/lbs. The MPG is really on par with it's power output and price range. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>170hp 5cyl, growl, stereo, climatic climate control, fold down seats, cargo space, cornering, power everything, drivers seat that moves up and down, best tiptronic trans I've ever driven with auto, sport, and manumatic modes. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 2008 Rabbit just turned 2 last week, and I love this car as much as I did the day I got it. Superb handling, fun to drive, comfortable, reliable - it has everything I wanted in a small hatchback. My neighbors have two 8-year0old Jettas that have been totally reliable, so I expect my Rabbit will be the same.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a 2008 rabbit and it only has 11000 miles, in one year i have taken my car to the dealer 5 times and each time for a different cause. This has been the most disappointing buying experience in my life, I have tried to lemon my car and the dealer has been very unhelpfull, I also had a factory person come to see my car and they just keep on making excuses.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>the car is pretty and it looks nice. the material inside makes a cracking noise when it's hot and you turn the ac on or when it gets cold. I also have had engine problems.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What can I say this rabbit has been a great car I've owned mine for 1 1/2 years and NO problem. People complain about mileage I average 24 city and 30 hwy . Maybe there are some really lead footed people out there to be getting less then 17 city . And the power is great for this type of car NO its not like a V8 camaro nor a V8 mustang but peppy enough ,if I wanted power I would have bought a V8 car. As far as price goes you cant get a better car for it. A friend just bought a 09 civic EXL great car but cost over $21,000 and mine has more room . My friends are impressed with the room this car has. The car I had before was a volvo960 wagon and the rabbit has more leg room.I will buy another one</TEXT>
<FAVORITE> love the red and blue dashlights ,roomy , peppy , style , love the hatchback. I really like the smart front wipers and rear wipers. ASR works great never lost traction in the heavy snow Ohio had last year. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I upgraded from a 1999.5 MKIV Golf GLS to this 2008 2.5 2dr Rabbit. Awesome car. 16000 trouble free miles over my 1st year of ownership, great get up and go, great ride. Not as much storage space as before and the interior is not as refined as previous models, but still way nicer than the same priced JDM or US cars. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 170HP engine, Tiptronic tranny, so-much-fun-to-drive factor. All the bells and whistles that are standard on a base model VW (that are all extra options on JDM + US cars). The great growl when revving the 5 cylinder engine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After about a year with my Rabbit, I can finally write a review. The Rabbit is a fun little car to drive, with a lot of pep. The 6 speed tiptronic transmission is a lot of fun and very unexpected in such a low price car. The interior and build quality constantly amaze me after having Fords, Pontiacs, Chevys. The 2.5 engine doesn't mind being revved, and sounds pretty good when doing it. Although, it is a fairly thirsty little car, as I average 17 in city driving. It replaced a Crown Vic which was getting 12, so I can't complain that much. Not a bad car in winter either, never got stuck once with a good set of snow tires.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned a lot of cars. I used to love rwd cars and trucks and hated fwd. I love my rabbit. The interior is way better than what my friends have. It looks great, especially with my optional 5 spoke Gray wheels which sets off the look of the car. The drivers door came off set and scratched the paint, warenty fixed that in 2 days. I don't understand the brakes, every car I have owned gets brake dust all over the front wheels but on this car it gets dust on the rear wheels. I was really hard on them a couple times to see what they are capable of and the rear brakes got so hot I could light a cigarette off it. I don't understand it but I haven't had a problem with them yet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having driven the wheels off my 1991 Toyota Tercel (200k miles) I really wanted a new car. I can't believe what you get for the money. Features that would be extra on any other car are standard on my Rabbit. The only option I got was the i-pod adapter. Everything else, cruise, power windows/locks, air-con and more were standard. I love the sound of the engine and I think it has plenty of power. I wish it got a little better gas mileage, but it's not too bad. I'm leasing the car now, but I think that when the lease is up and the new version comes out I'm going to buy it. As long as they keep this up I'll be a VW customer from now on.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Neat little things that are very thoughtful, like the rear windshield wiper gives a cleaning swipe if the car was turned off and the front wipers were on when I shut the car off. I also love the interior. Everything is so well put together and the materials are top notch for any class of car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this 08 Rabbit in June and now 8 months later have no performance or build quality complains. Broke it in easy for 1500 mi. My son is the primary driver who uses it to commute back and forth to college and to work. We've taken it on 600+ miles trips to NJ and Pittsburgh and mpg has been excellent at 31 highway. The only recurring issue has been the crummy head unit for the stereo. Twice the cd player has failed. Dealer overnighted a replacement the first time, and I expect same replacement this time, but really why the cheapo stereo? I've thrown Walmart stereo/cd players into vehicles that have lasted for years with no issue. No other problems with this West Virginia Bunny.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, ride, front seat comfort, dash layout, mpg. I believe you have to break new vehicles in correctly and the VW is returning 26 city and 31 highway. Sporty solid feel and great handling. Glad we got this model before VW reduces the number of standard features on the 2010 re- design.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car after owning a Subaru Forester for 4 years. I decided that I no longer needed all wheel drive and wanted something a bit smaller and economical to own/drive. I take the car in for routine maintenance as required. I was a bit disappointed when at my last service of 19,400 miles I was told I needed new rear brakes. This is before fronts. VW tells me this is common to use rears that fast. Cost to replace $465 at dealer (did not have it done there, instead opted for local repair garage). If you had to do this every 19,000 miles it does not make this care economical to drive. I am told all VW's go through brakes that fast.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have long wanted a VW and finally purchased a slightly used 2008 model this year. I wanted a GTI, but it was out of my price range. I've test driven both and can say that the 5 cylinder Rabbit has enough power for most drivers and pretty much all driving situations. The suspension isn't as sporty (read: body lean) in the corners, but overall very fun to drive. Interior isn't as unique/special as the GTI's but still full of features and very comfortable. Great car with great fuel economy. I get 28mpg with approx 80% highway driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did a lot of research into Civics and Rabbits, and finally decided on the Rabbit! I love love it. It's amazingly fun to drive, has great pickup, and lots of bells and whistles that the Civic definitely lacks. The road noise is a little loud, but the 10 speaker stereo system drowns it out just fine. I would definitely recommend. </TEXT>

The engine to me is better than the German Twin Charger 1.4L (drove one, while my car was being serviced)If the 2010 Rabbit has this engine, I will buy that.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is truly an amazing vehicle for the price - outstanding performance. The 2008 Rabbit handles better than my 528i BMW - you never feel like you are losing control. Tight going into and coming out of turns. And acceleration; this car responds. I'm 6' 1" and fit comfortably. Controls are easy to reach and intuitive - well designed interior. Yes, it is very enjoyable to drive and exceeds my expectations for a car under $20k! When driving conservatively, the car averages around 27-28 MPG - highway gets 30 MPG easy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Rabbit in June of '08 as a replacement for my '06 Nissan Frontier which was swallowing gas by the gallon and losing value faster than the Big 3 and couldn't be happier. My Rabbit is a great car! The 6 speed Triptonic Auto is more than I could have ever asked for. Very peppy car, will go when you want it to, at the expense of poor mileage however. I average 21 or so in the city and up to 28 on a freeway trip. Interior quality is second to none, love that German engineering.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Strong, torque filled engine. Good mileage, but by no means a class leader. Very quick, looks great, build quality is awesome. Interior is the best for the price period.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased a used 2008 VW Rabbit for my wife to drive. She went from a Jeep to a VW. We also own a 2001.5 VW Passat Wagon which we purchased new. Anyone who purchases a VW should be aware that owning a VW is an experience with potentially expensive upkeep and maintenance. Also, the service at some VW dealers has been horrendous at best. The Rabbit is a well thought out car with many creature comforts not found on other cars. It drives and rides like a German car should, is solidly built and has none of the "tinny" feel of other small cars. The doors feel solid and the 5 cylinder is strong. Just be prepared to pay for maintenance and upkeep.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First, I didn't give any "10's" because something has to be literally perfect. That said, for the money, a great car. It's broken in and the last 3 fill ups have been right around the 30 mpg combined mark. I drive very conservatively and about 60/40 hwy/cty. 5 spd manual allows low rpm shifting as well. 5th gear could be taller for the highway, or a 6th gear would help out too. Car comes standard with a good number of things like remote entry. Fun to drive and well made. I'm coming from a 2006 C-Class MB, so I had high expectations. Seems to have met them so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is incredible for the money. It has great power, and it's built like a rock (meaning there are NO rattles). The quality of this car is better than any other car you will find for under $20,000 (except for other VW's). The manual transmission is the smoothest shifting transmission I have ever used. I drove 60 mph on my way to college in Maine and got 35 mpg for highway driving, which was much better than I expected. Just a great car, and more VW's will be purchased in my future.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is the perfect compromise of all the requirements I have for a vehicle. I wanted something more fuel efficient and smaller than the truck I was driving, it had to be comfortable, fun to drive, and have room for my dog. I looked at every 4 door hatch on the market, especially the fit, versa, and the Astra. The Rabbit is the only vehicle in that group that feels like a real car. It feels like a budget BMW with comfortable seats, an excellent driving position, and a wonderful 6spd automatic. OK like most other people I wish it got better mpg, but you do have to consider the solid safe car you are driving. I'm seeing 25+ mpg in mixed spirited driving. You can do better with practice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6 spd tiptronic transmission. The adjustable center arm rest of course! The comfortable seats, simple efficient controls. The combination of of good handling and low end torque is really fun.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The first thing you need to understand about this car is. It's not the most fuel efficient hatchback out there. However it is fun fun fun to drive. If you're like me and performance is important to you, for the price you can't beat it. Drove the Civic lx, ex and Nissan Sentra. Boring by comparison. Nice cars but no power. Suspension is a little soft for me (it rides well though) but what do you want for 16,800 dollars? I have alloy wheels and iPod adapter built in the armrest (with rear seat air vents) trip computer 10 speaker stereo. The 4 door jumps in price to around 20,000 dollars. The Honda dealership wanted around 20,000 out the door for an lx Civic coupe. Rabbit was 18.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>great power for an "economy" car. 170 hp and 177 torque. i own the 5 speed manual. zippy around town. in town i avg 23-24 mpg. remember i am more a performance oriented driver. keep that in mind with what i've posted for fuel economy. i don't save engine power for a rainy day. i use it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned my Rabbit now for a little over a month. Each and every day I look forward to the commute to work because the Rabbit is so much fun to drive. No problem merging onto the highway, or passing slower traffic. The ride is firm but smooth, and engine response is immediate. I test drove the Scion tC, Mazda-3, Toyota Matrix, Ford Focus, Subaru Impreza, and Chevy Cobalt. None of them could touch the Rabbit in terms of overall feel, and build quality. If you're looking for an inexpensive "fun" car, don't pass up test driving the Rabbit. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the car for about 3 months, and can not say enough praise about it. Very versatile, peppy and an overall amazing car. I have a slightly above average commute, and the mileage isn't bad at all, even in the city. Inside, ample space and comfort makes it a great alternative to an SUV or "Crossover" (whatever that is). Fun little "easter eggs" inside and out make me say, "Well, thats smart". </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for about 5 weeks and put 2000 miles on it. For the price (under $18k with 170 hp, 6 speed auto & Tiptronic) you really can't beat it. 95% of the mileage is city driving, and I avg 17.9 mpg, which isn't great but I do drive quite aggressively. Overall the car feels quite well-built, and given that I used to manage a valet lot and have driven Audi, BMW, Porsche, Lexus, Jaguar, etc, that is pretty impressive, especially at this price point. In my opinion you are basically getting a GTI at an economy car price - and my insurance is far cheaper than it would be with a sports car. The only downside is the fuel economy, but if you can get past that, this car is a winner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After exhaustive research and test drives, I went with the Rabbit. I bought the 4-door with the manual transmission, which I hear is a combination that won't be available next year. Not to mention I really don't like the looks of the next generation Rabbit. I knew the gas mileage wasn't great before I bought the car, so I'm not all that disappointed. I love the torque, this thing really pulls even from off-idle. The driving position and controls are top notch. I wish the diesel was available when I bought this, would've been a no-brainer. The inline-5 is a weird-sounding engine, not really worth revving up. All in all, I'm happy with it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Came from a BMW 545i; and while this is no BMW, it is pretty much fun to drive. Terrific value for what comes standard. Love the Satellite Radio. Driver's seat is more comfortable than the BMW's. Legroom is more generous too up front. Would love a bit more power. Could use larger side mirrors. These create blind spots. Adaptive steering should be optional. I don't care for it. Mileage could be a bit better too. A lot of room in back with back seats folded. My 68" road bike fits in completely when I push the front passenger seat down. I have the car for two weeks and everything works the way it should. My first two fill ups were 24 mpg. The last one was only 22.6. All in all, a steal at $20k.</TEXT>

<TEXT> I am a grandmother of five. Drive for pleasure and business. This car is precise, concise and fun. Great turning radii and very responsive. Extremely comfortable seats and easy on the eyes dashboard. I drive a lot of back country roads. The tiptronic offers the fun of a manual transmission and the flexibility of an automatic. I handed my Honda Fit over to one of my kids. The comfort of the Rabbit was impossible to resist. Heated seats and partially electronic, they are easy to adjust precisely. The car feels solid and centered and leaves me fatigue free. I am averaging 26-28 mph and the car is not broken in yet. Sound system is solid and satellite radio subscription is free for a tryout. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had it for 5 days and wish I would have got an automatic. The motor seems lazy between idle and 1200 r.p.m.s , so I stall it quite often on takeoff. I have owned quite a few sticks in my life and never had such a problem. I love everything else about the car though. once I am moving it drives great and has plenty of power. I have owned some beetles over the years, a 63, 65, two 66's,a 68 and a 74. I always told my friends, If you can't drive a vw stick you will never be able to drive a stick period.

<TEXT>I've had my 08 rabbit for almost a year now and haven't had any major complaints so far. I actually like the placement of the iPod dock in the center console since it hides it from prying eyes. I don't like the way the radio system controls it though. The interior is nice (and very well laid out) and roomy and I'm pretty tall. Everyone that has been inside the rabbit always comments on how much room they have, even in the back seat. The side panels on the interior do scuff pretty easily though, but they are also easy to clean. On the road it feels like a substantial car, but is easy to toss around. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My experience is a lot like Sharon's. My decision was between the Honda Civic and VW Rabbit, and I ultimately decided on the Rabbit as I preferred the look and it seemed more fun to drive. I really should have put more stock into the gas mileage. I mostly do all my driving in the city - pure stop lights and traffic the whole way to work and back. I'm seriously averaging between 10-17 MPG in the city. I can't tell you how stressed out I am about this. Instead of enjoying this gorgeous little car I loathe having to drive anywhere because all I can think about is the gas mileage. I've been told there is a break in period but if I could do it again I'd get something else. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When it was time to get a new car, I was torn between 2 cars. 2008 Honda Civic and the 2008 VW Rabbit. I test drive these 2, and really liked both cars. But time to decide which to get is a pain!! Anyway, emotions got better of me, and so I picked the Rabbit. It has pickup, power and appeal. However, the gas mileage sucks. Literally. I drive on the highway at 60 mph (trying to save $$) everyday, but still get about 25-miles to the gallon. City mileage, forget it. It;'s nowhere close to the sticker mileage. It's more like 9-20 mph. I am gypped and I am not enjoying this car at all. I AM DISAPPOINTED! So there, that's my honest opinion. I should've gotten the Civic. City mileage is 39 mph.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hate iPod feature in the arm rest. This option is the worst. The design seems wasn't well planned. It's like an after thought design, which was slapped on to make it more appealing to the iPod users. I tell ya, I only used it once, but it was more aggravating than anything. No favorite feature here.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>You can read all the other reviews for how drivers like this car. They are correct, its sporty, fun, quick, and comfortable. Mass production is not art very often but the styling of this vehicle is beautiful. It is a total expression of minimalism. Everything is understated. The lines are beautiful from any angle. The interior is incredibly simple, yet amazingly feature rich. The controls are very simple to operate, basically allowing for full operation using two dials and two levers. The grace and nimbleness this car exudes while exhibiting its prowess are unbelievably sexy. If you are in the hatchback market, save yourself time and purchase this vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall look of the exterior/interior. The feeling the cars gives back while driving. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I owned just over a week now and love driving my Rabbit everywhere. I drove a variety of cars before I bought this one and I am very happy. I have a wide back and the seats fit excellent for that. The power decline is great, and love the sunroof. Also came with heated seats and windshield washer nozzles which will be great for Minnesota winters. Traction control for 2008 is an option and I read 2009 will be a standard in all VW's. The manual transmission will not be available for 4 door next year. I am very happy with my new car and will drive it for many years. Thank you. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>One button up and down windows. Automatic tilt or opening sunroof. 10 speaker 6 CD Changer. 8-Way heated seat with power decline. Alloy rims. Precise handling, turning, and acceleration. Clean, uncomplicated interior. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only had this car for 6 weeks, but already it has shown me the build quality VW is capable of, but has eluded them for years. The fit and finish are unparalleled in any vehicle I've seen under $20,000. It's FAST. You just barely tap the gas pedal and it seems to want to take off and fly. The 170 hp engine (only have 2,500 miles on it thus far) just begs you to wind it out. It seems to have a remarkable similarity in torque to old-school GTIs. I paid only $15,900 for this vehicle (only option added was the $450 ESP program). Looking forward to many pleasurable driving miles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The electronic slip program seems to have a mind of its own. Tested it out during heavy rain @140 kph/87 mph. Excellent handling. Assured and safe feeling in all conditions thus far. Love the low front view, 3-blink touch turn signals, 4-wheel ABS and the std. creature comforts. And the looks- WOW!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought this little car in order to make little trips into town. I needed something that was easy on gas. After looking at what's on the market in the 19 to 22 thousand dollar range there was only one choice. The Rabbit is very well built, fun and easy to drive. I was really impressed by the quality and the number of options that came standard. This is a powerful little machine. It tops the market, in other words you get more for your dollar with the VW rabbit than any other car in the price range and above. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, it is a good little car. It has enough power to get you going, though you do have to hammer on it to get a immediate power. It is terribly uncomfortable on longer drives, but you can't expect luxury comfort out of a $18k car. Gas mileage is ok, you can get over 30 out of it when on the highway and doing near the speed limit, if you open it up, it acts like an 8 cyl.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned this vehicle for about 2 months now and couldn't be happier. I traded in a Toyota Yaris, and I'm not sure I'll ever go back from German engineering. It's a solidly built, small car that comes with a lot of features standard (a BIG difference from Toyotas at the very least). My old car felt like a toy compared to this one. Not sure about reliability just yet since it's still new, but I have high expectations from VW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my sixth VW, so, since I have survived VW's reliability problems, I must like them. This car is a good value for money, with features that competitors can only dream of. In Canada, heated seats are an essential; why don't more manufacturers make this available (and how about heated steering wheels?)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The best features are the quality of everything and the handling. Heated seats are a big plus. I also enjoy the lack of exterior chrome trim, which I think is ugly.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>had it only 2 weeks, but driving A LOT. my first experience in a rabbit made a terribly disconcerting metallic rubbing whine when i test drove one initially (with alloy wheels pkg.), but the one i bought had the steel wheels and no such noises. still have quite a bit of clutch pedal travel compared to my subaru outback and am still trying to get used to launching without excessive revving (maybe i'm just a retard) and while in 1st/2nd gears, torque dies around 3500 rpm. i expected more torque since due to 177 lb./ft. rating. shoulda bought the DSG auto trans in retrospect. wished leather seats were available. almost dislocated my left shoulder reaching back for the safety belt.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive mostly city in San Francisco, and it handles the bumps just fine. Zips in and out of traffic. 5sp manual is much easier to manage vs. my old 2000 passat 6cyl. Lacking torque just a bit at the very low end, but you can start from 2mph in 2nd if it's flat terrain. Interior materials are fantastic. On mostly city driving with hills, I'm getting 17mpg (but it's San Francisco). I estimate pure hwy at 29, but I got 30 in my Passat V6. Same passenger volume as in B5 Passat! This is ingenious! On reliability: had valve problem - dealer replaced entire cylinder head, and car was in shop for 3 weeks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new Rabbit. The lease on my 2004 Passat was up, and I was tired of paying for premium gas, so I tried the Rabbit and loved the way it felt. Although it is in a different class (economy vs. midsize), I find it sportier and more agile than my 04 Passat, but it doesn't ride quite as well. The new boost in horsepower gives it plenty of power to get out of the way. It has enough interior room for most needs, although the family would probably be more comfortable in my wife's minivan. The build quality appears to be very good. Overall, another great product from Volkswagen.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is great fun to drive. The build quality is excellent; it has plenty of power and torque, and the manual shifter is butter smooth. I was looking for an economical hatchback that would serve as a city car and also be comfortable on long trips. A hatchback made the most sense, since the most usual passenger is a 100lb. hound. He doesn't mind that the rear windows don't open. Still, with the back seat up, the car has plenty of room for the grandkids. My only complaint is, having found the ideal seat/steering wheel combo, I can't seem to adjust the seatbelt away from my neck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought my Shadow Blue 08 Rabbit 2 months ago and driven it 3200 miles. I've already done a 1000 mile road trip and driven my kids to school regularly. I look for reasons to hop in the Bunny and drive. It's really fun to drive and scoots through trafic like a knife through butter. I've driven Toyotas, Mazdas, Hondas and Nissans and while they've been decent cars, nothing comes close to the Rabbit in build quality, interior design, the plethora of features on a base model and best of all the sheer fun factor.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I LOVE the adjustable arm rest(great for long road trips),which can be extended forward and raised or lowered to fit just right. The 6 disc stereo with MPP3 puts out awesome sound. The glove box cooling vent, the fold flat front passengers seat & additional cup holders in the doors are all great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Originally I was looking for an upgrade to a small SUV but couldn't find anything with pep, decent MPG, and a sticker below $25000. So on to the hatches! $20-22k was more in the price range and the Rabbit perfectly fits the bill. This thing has so much ROOM for a hatch. It's amazing. The only roomy complaint I have is that the drivers knees are *slightly* cramped. There is plenty of length, but something feels a little too tight when it comes to the steering wheel and the knees. But that's it! That's about the only complaint. The interior, exterior, ride, zip/power, handling, and features are way beyond the competition. 4door auto, ESP, sunroof, alloys, and 170HP for $20k. Nice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Torque, smooth ride, style and design, stereo, good MPG for what you get (25mpg avg, 80% city), regular gas, rear seat space, solid feel when opening/closing doors and hatch, room for the dog in the back, and did I mention it's fast?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the car 5 days ago so I can't yet speak for the reliability and the quality. But so far its a great car to own. I bought the car stripped except for the alloy wheels. But stripped the car has just about all I need. The 8 speaker stereo is great. The car rides very comfortable, it hugs the road, and the 5 speed manual is about the smoothest I've ever driven! There is some road noise mainly from the 16" tires as at a full stop in traffic the engine is very quiet. Also the AC/heat tends to get loud when cranked up but hey, the car cost $15K. My biggest problem is with the 2.5L engine is avoiding a ticket! </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Rabbit is fun to drive and inexpensive to purchase. Handling is very good. Acceleration from the 170 horse 5 cylinder is vastly better than the approx 120 horsepower and 4 cylinders of most cars at this price point. Interior space is good compared to the small exterior. From its price and size you might think it is an economy car but it is not. Gas mileage is poor (pathetic 22 MPH after 4 tanks). Dependability ratings are not nearly as good as an Asian car either. If you think of it as an inexpensive sports car you will be happy, if you think of it as something in the class of a bullet proof Honda or Toyota you may be disappointed. Overall I am neither very happy or unhappy with it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive. Good handling. Good acceleration. Hatchback and fold down seats make good use of space. Plenty of leg and head room for full size man in small car. Inexpensive to purchase (16K) but does not feel cheap. Solid feel. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Searched for over 3 months to replace an aging Jeep. I wanted a hatchback for its space and size. We looked at the Fit, Versa, Mazda3, Mini, Caliber and numerous others. The finish and quality of the Rabbit was the best. The performance is outstanding, I love the turn radius and size. With my old cherokee, I had a little extra space in my garage. With the Rabbit, I have even more with the same responsiveness and HP as the old 4.0L inline 6 in the Jeep with significantly better gas mileage - it doubled. The dealership I purchased it encouraged naming it, so we now call it Rascal! (after Elmer Fudd wascally wabbit)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am 100% satisfied with my Rabbit. For me, the Rabbit was a perfect balance of economy and performance. I had considered a whole spectrum of vehicles- from a Toyota Yaris to a Mazda Mazda3 hatchback. The VW Rabbit sits somewhere in between those two models in terms of mpg and is competitive with the Mazda3's performance, though I might say the Mazda has better handling. One thing that the Rabbit, and German cars in general, have over any other car I was considering was it's awesome build quality. My Rabbit is a small car and is by no means a tank, but it feels as strong and tough as one. Hondas and Toyotas feel like tin cans compared to VW's. The Rabbit is also very zippy and fun to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The turning radius on this car is tops! It really adds to the fun factor. Digital display of tripometer, temperature, mpg estimator, and more is really neat and I like indigo and red illumination of the console. iPod hookups are great. 5 cylinder engine - a unique compromise between L4s and V6s.</FAVORITE>

Yes, the engine is a bit noisy, and road noise is somewhat high, but what the heck. This is supposed to be an economy car. I never thought about VW because of the bad rep re: reliability.

<TEXT>Being a Former Mini Cooper S owner, I was looking for a car that could match the feel of the Mini?s drivability, while offering more practicality. The new 170HP engine makes a small, but noticeable increase in peppiness and allows the driver to have fun. Though the suspension has received some criticism for being soft, I feel it is pretty close to replicating the feel of the Mini; it is better than any other car I?ve driven in this class. I was very close to purchasing a Mazda 3, but the build quality feels more substantial in the VW Rabbit. While the Mazda is quoted for having the ?German feel?, the VW is truly has the German feel all the way, from the steering to the engine tuning.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The VW Rabbit is a fun little car. For the price that you pay and the options you get, it is amazing. The downside I found is that the manual gets fewer MPG then the automatic (must be because they want you to spend the extra $1075 for the auto) but the manual is a lot more fun. The ride is very bumpy but I have come to expect that from smaller cars. Other then that I highly recommend to any one this car.
