<TEXT>My wife and I were in the market for a sporty SUV and after looking at the Nissan Murano, Lexus RX350, and Ford Edge, we decided on the Santa Fe. Simply put you get more for your money and this vehicle has luxury written all over it. You cannot beat the warranty and the dealership is top notch.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my sixth Hyundai, my first suv. All five were great but my suv has more squeaks & rattles than all others combined. The fog light switch gave out twice & lost a tirerod end but overall reliability is good. The OME tires are poor. I highway drive a lot in sales & got half the mileage on the Bridgestone tires that I got on my other Hyundai cars. The dealer said that is the way they are and nothing can be done. So expect to buy a new SUV and the next summer spend $600.00 plus for new summer tires. The tires were not on all year, in this area I use snow tires from early fall to late spring putting more than half the mileage on them and not the tires that came on the machine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our 2008 Sante fe after looking at Ford, Chev, Toyota and Chrysler and decided that the Sante Fe was an all better deal, price wise, handling and style. We had a problem with the airbag sensor which was irratic, coming on and going off was not predicatable. This was finally fixed. Also the accelerator sensor acted up. The vehicle would pulsate from 600 RPM to 1500 RPM. The sensor was replced and now works well. Love the interior design especially the dashboard lighting. Exterior design is also good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our Santa Fe has everything to offer for our family of four. Really smooth ride and very fuel-effcient for it's size. Only thing is the engine's reliability . Only 10500 miles and already there is a small oil leak. I'm taking it into the Dealer to get it looked at, but I must say I'm disappointed that a brand new car would already start leaking oil.... :-( Overall, I recommend the car for what it has to offer at a reasonable price. Only flaw about the interior is the lack of an auxiliary port, but I found out that the 09 models were equipped with this, standard. Should of waited a lil longer :-/</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car has a little over 10000 miles on it since bought new in january. The wife gets 22.5 MPG mixed city and highway driving. I get around 26 MPG driving it highway to work. A recent leak in the power steering is being addressed by the dealer. The rack is being replaced and the dealer provided a loaner car over the Labor day Holiday. We have been treated very well by everyone since the car purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a used 2008 Hyundai Santa Fe with 5500 miles on it for 18,900 and then it rained saturating the rugs on the driver's side with water. Two days later it was back at the dealership. They put it through the car wash and said the leak was coming from the door and that it would be ready in two days. They then called and said they were going to keep it two weeks. I took it back home waxed it and kept it in the garage. Last Saturday it poured, I had left it outside and again the rugs were saturated with water. Resealing of the windshield didn't work. This experience has soured me on Hyundais although I really liked the feel and large cargo area. Carmax took the vehicle back.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded a SAAB 9-3 for my Santa Fe, and I couldn't be happier. It is very comfortable for long trips, and I average around 24 mpg on the highway. I have been getting around 19-20 in city driving. My only complaint is a buzzing noise from the rear whenever the engine hits 2100 rpm. I am sure it will be taken care of when I have my next service. This is my fifth Hyundai, and it is by far the best. I'm looking forward to buying a Genesis when my Santa Fe is paid off!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Comfortable to drive, and build quality seems decent overall. So far 48 days in the shop with a head gasket leak. Actually, the factory FORGOT TO INSTALL THE REAR HEAD GASKET so it was a compression leak, but a tiny leak only when hot. I wish the dealer had pulled the heads first instead of trying everything else first. We'll see how well it does with a properly assembled engine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I got a great deal on a year old Santa Fe with 14K miles, and very glad I bought it. The ride is very quiet and comfortable, and there's ample room for 4-5 people. It handles well and the 3.3 liter V-6 gives it plenty of power. I get ~24 mpg highway, and overall average 22 mpg, with about 70% highway driving. My '02 Subaru Outback averaged about 23 mpg, and considering the Santa Fe is larger, roomier and much more powerful, I'm happy with the mileage. The interior of the Hyundai feels fairly upscale, and it is SO much quieter than my Subie ever was. Considering the size, it has a remarkably tight turning circle. The Santa Fe is a great choice if you're looking for a mid-size crossover SUV!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet ride, good acceleration and handling, decent gas mileage, long basic warranty (6 year, 60K miles), tight turning circle and good build quality. The vehicle really feels solid. Oh, the blue dashboard lights are cool too. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've been driving for 28 years and this is the best car I ever owned. It seats 4 comfortably and I can haul a lot of stuff when I put the seats down. Fuel mileage is excellent for a car with this much storage. After reading about terrible problems in the automatic gear shift from 1st to 2nd, I made sure to check this out repeatedly during the test drive. 10 months later, I have zero problems with that or anything else. I got all the upgrades except for the navigation system and the roof rack. I'm thinking of getting one for my wife and get the $3,500 gov't "CARS" plan since the MPG difference qualifies. Unless you get a rare lemon, this is really a great crossover.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Santa fe in the middle of January and I am fully satisfied. It is a dream to drive, smooth, comfortable, powerful. I have not yet experienced the bad shift from 1st to 2nd. I am in Cdn and we have a slightly larger gallon, so bear that in mind when I say I get 22.5 miles per gallon in the city. If I am real careful and gentle about how I drive. I also looked at everything else out there before I bought and just loved all that the S.Fe had to offer and how smooth it was.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I now have 3000 miles on my 2008 LTD. The car is great for design, both interior and exterior. The only problem is a vibration between 45 - 75 MPH. It is not the tires or wheels and Hyundai service has not been able to locate the problem. I rode tested other 2008 Santa Fe's and have noticed the same problem.

Poor quality. Gas mileage is about 20% lower than the sticker averages on the vehicle. Just another falsehood. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Consumer Reports summed it up in one word - pleasant! It is an all-around nice vehicle. Nice ride, comfortable, good power, safe, and very quiet. After putting 1,600 miles on it, I am more impressed with it now than when we originally purchased it. We tried the competitors - Rav, CRV, Forester - but the Santa Fe beat them all in our book. We were hesitant to purchase because of the past unreliable reputation of Hyundai, but took a chance. Hopefully it will prove as reliable as a Honda or Toyota over time. The long warranty offers some peace of mind as well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Santa Fe about 2 1/2 weeks ago and I do not regret it one bit. So far it as been fun to drive. I am getting about 20 to 21 mpg which is not bad for a small SUV. The interior is very comfortable- my kids love it. It has great storage in the back for all your kids sport equipment. The Exterior- the color (Midnight Blue) is beautiful it sparkles in the sunlight. Overall this is a nice car for the money. Also, note in Car and Drive it was rated one of the top SUV's- The Nissan Murano beat it only on speed (I believe) but it won everything else. </TEXT>

This is one of the nicest vehicles I've ever owned - better than my Acura, Subaru, Nissan and most everything else. (Well, my 'Vette was more fun) I have had no concerns with the transmission as a few others have. I've gone on a few trips, including up into the high country in Colorado, and the car is a delight. Comfortable, stylish, convenience features galore, decent sound system, and never less than 22 MPG. Ya just have to drive thoughtfully, folks! All in all, an excellent experience.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Before buying the Santa Fe we test drove the honda CRV, Toyota Rav 4, Saturn Vue, among many others. This car was far superior in EVERY category. Just listening to the doors closing, ring a sound of quality. Very happy with mileage, which is 21 in mixed city driving and 24 on the highway. Vehicle handles very well, road and engine noise are almost non-existent. It is very fast, shifts and brakes flawlessly and is extremely comfortable. We have had absolutely no problems since purchased last year and 20,000 miles ago. This is my wifes car, but I use it every chance I get as it is a much more fun to drive than my gas guzzling F150! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Researched for over 2 months for a good SUV and zeroed onto Acura MDX and Hyundai Santa Fe. Of course, both cars are not in the same league to compare, but when value for money and budget push to make a choice, Santa Fe is a nice pick. Drove about 2K miles in last 40 days and its been a great ride so far. Its very smooth, nice pick-up and a great handling. Rides like a car. Mileage improved to 21 MPG HWY from 17 MPG HWY over the period. I prefer fill up with Premium fuel as I get better pick-up and less engine noise than the regular fuel.I think $100/year extra on fuel for better engine life, pick up and good feel is worth paying for(purely personal opinion) Two Thumbs up, Hyundai :)</TEXT>

I will write again after I have the car longer. I did a lot of research before I purchased and found that it was the most car for the money in it's class. I don't understand why all the manufacturers are selling cars with roof racks but no cross rails. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After taking about 6 months to decide on what SUV to buy I finally decided to get a Santa Fe. It is a very solid built SUV with attractive styling inside and out. There is plenty of room in the second row for 2 adults to sit comfortably and the second row seat backs recline which adds more comfort. The front seats are great with plenty of leg room and have a plush feeling. Dash design is nice and the blue lighting is not as distracting as a green or a red. Over all I think that Hyundai is well on there way to pass Toyota in quality and price. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had this vehicle about 3 weeks and am extremely satisfied with everything about it except for the transmission. There definitely is a slip in the transmission. It doesn't happen on every acceleration from a stop, but enough to make it irritating.It almost seems like a down- shift jerk (automatic trans.)after it has already shifted into second,it drops, or jerks into a lower gear and immediately shifts again to the gear that it previously was in. This has happened to me only 5-6 times in 3 weeks. After reading the other review about the transmission problem I see that it's not just me out there with this problem. And evidently,there's no help from Hyundai corp. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I noticed on some reviews that there was great complaint about both the transmission and mileage on the 3.3L 5A equipped Santa Fe's. As a recent purchaser of a Santa Fe I have to say, if you people did not test drive the vehicle shame on you. I for one have no complaints. The transmission does not "slip" it is shifting into overdrive before shifting into the next gear. And so far in mixed driving I am averaging 17.4 MPG. There are no filed issues with the DOT or any other agency on the Transmission in addition to no complaints with Consumers Reports. I have a feeling those of you who are complaining have a case of buyers remorse.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I spent 40+ hours researching many SUV's and drove several as well (used MDX, X5, X3, RX330, new Outlander, new CRV, new Rogue, new Escape). For the money, this is simply the best value and best looking. Drives like a car, very quiet ride (almost as good as my Toyota Sequoia). I can relate to the hesitation between 1st and 2nd gears now that I've had for a few weeks. Not as bad as previous reviews, but worth noting, particularly if you are being a "conservative" driver to save gas, which by the way, does not come close to the sticker estimate. We have yet to get to 20 MPG, even on the highway. That's been the biggest disappointment. Overall, very pleased so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I didn't start out looking for an SUV, but I wanted a vehicle with AWD and a hatch back. My last car was a Passat sedan and I was looking for something with that had greater reliability/functionality. After driving subcompact SUVs and crossovers I was dissatisfied with the power and the cargo capacity. With continued research I stumbled on the Santa Fe which many publications consider a safe, comfortable and reliable SUV. Once I drove it I was sold. It rides great especially on the highway and the seats are extremely comfortable. I have had it for one week and put 1K miles on it with no problems. Mileage is 21 in mixed driving. I have received complements on looks of the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle has the absolute worse transmission I have ever experienced. It is defective between 1st and 2nd gear. What makes this more aggravating is that the dealers "acts" like nothing is wrong when the mechanics clearly experience the problem. They "allege" all the codes check out but this transmission has a slippage problem. I think Hyundai is out to screw the consumer and knows about his problem but will not acknowledge it. I am hoping that the government investigates some of the transmission complaints. This is a horrible vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did quite a bit of online research and a few test drives before purchasing. I've only had the Santa Fe for a week, but I am happy so far. It fits my needs. Auto transmission is quick to 2nd gear and smooth. Combined city and hwy driving is netting 21.5 MPG. Plenty of seat/shoulder room which was an issue in some other mid/compact SUV's. Interior looks sharp with the black leather and I love the blue accent lighting. The hidden storage area in the rear will be very useful for sports gear and more. The tweeters on the Infinity speakers have a high-pitched whine at low volumes. Wife and dealership can't hear it. I sat in another Limited w/Infinity speakers and whine is there too.</TEXT>

Going from first to second gear is whatever you want to call it, a slip, hesitation, pause, delay but it is not normal and Hyundai knows about and continues to put a vehicle on the market with this transmission. It ruins the entire driving experience because when its cold, the hesitation is horrible from first to second gear and continues, at a milder rate, even when its warms up.

<TEXT>My wife and I spent 2-3 months researching the purchase of a new vehicle to replace our worn-out Mazda MPV minivan. Final decision came down to the Santa Fe and Toyota Rav4.The Santa Fe won primarily on the greater "bang for our buck". The Santa Fe has more than adequate power. The ride is smooth and quiet. The interior is well thought out and comfortable. The exterior styling is attractive, but not "over-done". This vehicle is a pleasure to drive. I will have to see how reliability will be over time, but Hyundai's great warranty helps with piece of mind in that area.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have found this vehicle a fun car to drive and own. This is our second Hyundai, the first being an 2003 Elantra. It is a comfortable car that travels well and is overall an excellent vehicle. The gas mileage is a little low, (22mpg)but not a spoiler. So far the only issue we have is a loud high frequency buffeting noise that only is noticable when the rear side door window is rolled down. It occurs at 60 mph and stays with you until you reach alomost 95. I am taking it to the dealer to see what is causing this and if it can be fixed. I hope that it can because we live in Florida and although the a/c works fine, we didn't spend that much money to be cooped up all the time. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Instrumentation layout is fine. Seats are comfortable. It has an adequate stereo system. Power to weight is proportionate and responsive at all speeds</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fuel economy not the greatest. But compared to a truck, its great. The only thing I'm not totally impressed by is the 2nd and 3rd row air ducts for heating. they don't blow as hard or as hot of air as the front do. Other than that it truly is the smartest and best buy I've done in a long time. Great job to Hyundai, and building vehicles that extremely reliable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just added the SF to our group of cars. We have had an '06 Azera for 1.5 years and it has been a trouble-free and enjoyable car to drive. When adding a vehicle due to a teen driver coming of age, I passed my '04 Element to the kid and was looking for the right blend of space, comfort, performance and value. I drove the Rogue, Murano, Pilot, Sequoia, Sportage, Tucson and Veracruz. The Santa Fe offered me the best combination for the qualities I wanted. The SE is very well put together, quiet, roomy and my first tank of spirited suburban driving returned 20mpg...surprised for sure at that. Hyundai has gotten the build and materials issues handled. We'll watch durability over time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ex-owner of a Pontiac Grand Prix I was somewhat apprehensive about getting a Santa Fe. However after 2 months I have no regrets at all in having purchased the Santa Fe. The interior is spacious and well made. The exterior is an eye opener compared to the previous models. The drive is smooth and very comparible to the Grand Prix which was superb. The handling is very good. No regrets what so ever would recommend it to anybody.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having put almost 7000 miles on the Santa Fe in 4 months, I have to say that I am very satisfied. Overall a great vehicle. It is comfortable, spacious, and tows anything I can put in a 4x8 utility trailer. Gas mileage has been about 18 mpg with mostly suburban driving, but I leave it idling a lot for my daughter in the summer. Highway is about 22, but would be a lot better if I could keep it below 80. My wife frequently gets 24-26 on the interstate when she drives. Power is adequate, but not breathtaking. Overall the best value in the 20K SUV price range.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our 11th time buying a new vehicle and the first time buying a foreign vehicle. The Santa Fe is our favorite vehicle ever. It is fun to drive and very easy to handle. Even though we live in snowy Minnesota, we opted for the FWD and have had no regrets. The FWD handled beautifully in the snow and ice last winter. This vehicle cannot be beat in terms of quality, safety, warranty, price value, and cost to insure. An added bonus is the great dealership where we purchased it - St. Cloud Hyundai. We'll be back there the next time we need to buy a vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased this SUV after driving an Infinity G-35x and missing the roominess from my previous SUV. Also, Hyundai was recommended by other friends who have one. Only issue so far is pulling to left. After two alignments, seems to be okay. Although steering is pretty sensitive. Like all the features, styling, performance (little sluggish in shifting between 1st & 2nd gear) so far, after 2000 miles. CD player is only 1 CD capacity?? If reliability holds up, seems like a very good vehicle for the price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Santa Fe handles very well in the snow and is much better than my other 4 wheel drive. After 8000 miles however the navigation/radio unit went out. Sent it to Hyundai dealer for warranty work and the part is back ordered indefinitely. Reportedly there are 50+ on back order ahead of me so apparently this is not an isolated incident. So I selected this vehicle because of the nav and other upgrades and they are unreliable. Fuel mileage is about 21.9 mpg. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased this car one year ago after looking at RAV-4, CR-V, Escape, Murano, Rogue, and Tuscon. We might not have ever considered it except we have a 2000 Hyundai Accent that has been fantastic. This is pretty much my dream car. It has 99% of the features I really wanted (leather, sunroof, wheel-mounted audio controls, CD/MP3 with changer, blue lights...just missing the auxiliary jack which I hear they now have on the 2009 model). My husband and I actually mistook it for a Lexus in a Target parking lot a few months after we bought it. The interior materials are top-notch and I actually like the firm ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hyundai is obviously not Toyota or Honda..that being said the Santa Fe is our third Hyundai SUV and we have never had major issues with any of them. The ride in this SUV is by far the quietest and most comfortable of other SUVs in ITS PRICE RANGE. We also have a 2008 CRV and the Santa Fe is a much better pic for highway travel. Gas mileage on the other hand has not improved from our older Santa Fe. I consistently get 21mpg mixed driving. You will not get 24mpg on a tank,ever. On a road trip I managed 23mpg going 70mph. Our AWD CRV averages 25mpg...then again it's lighter and a 4cyl. Fit and finish is great; front seat is not good for tall drivers..but acceptable. Trade-in is terrible</TEXT>

<TEXT>I chose my brand new Santa Fe over a used Lexis with 15K miles. WORST mistake ever. Just a months after owning it I had to have the carpet replaced twice and bumper repainted because paint was peeling off. Now after 20K miles the dash is peeling and the leather seats have rubbed down to nothing leaving a rip in the driver seat. I'm 5'4", weigh 120lbs but they say it's not covered under warranty because I'm not entering my car the right way. The latches on the third row seat broke and had to be replaced. I'm scared what the value is going to be if I decide not to keep it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm happy overall with my new '08 Santa Fe. I've never owned a Hyundai, but they sold me with the massive warranty and assurance program. I looked at CR-Vs and Escapes, and I found this was a much better priced vehicle for the options I wanted. It's comfortable and snazzy. It drives more like an SUV than a zippy car. Braking distance sometimes sneaks up on you-- I've taken to adding some following distance. There's plenty of leg room. I wish there was more headroom in the driver's side. Anyone more than 6' tall will feel a bit scrunched by the vehicle roof when driving (my boyfriend is 6'2" and feels the roof is uncomfortably close to his head).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, a good value for the money compared with other SUVs in this class.However...at 4000 km there was an oil leak which took 3 trips to the dealership and was finally fixes with silocone sealant.During the winter,the windshield washer fluid reservoir broke and had to be replaced.Windshield is surprisingly fragile - accidentally dropped the wiper arm when replacing the wipers and the windshield cracked all the way to the top.I also have a 2005 Chevy Malibu and the Santa Fe is missing a lot of the nice add-ons.It even doesn't have auto on headlights (come on, I get leather seats and not this!).I have had less problems with my Chevy (and previous one) in 5 years than with the Santa Fe in 1.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Chose the Santa Fe over Rav4 for slightly larger size and cost savings. Initially I like the vehicle, but starting to find annoying issues. Items like the lackluster highway gas mileage (21-22 avg), flat audio from radio (or speakers), and unresolvable issue with car pulling to the right drive me nuts. Turn signal clicker too loud. The door ajar beeper is way too loud and annoying, and beeps at every little thing. The tiny foot rest to the left of the break pedal is too low and out of the way to use. Drivers seat is too high for taller drivers. The spring in the front sun visor causes it to pop forward and limit adjustment.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet cabin. Comfortable ride (after dropping tire pressure from dealer setting of 38 psi). Blue accent lighting. Fan control with eight settings. Comfortable seat with lumbar. Decent storage with rear fold flat seats. Lighted cup holder in front. Interior color available other than black.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With only 600 miles I am starting to feel like this was a bad decision. Transmission is already acting strange. It can't seem to find the right gear going up a hill. Very frustrating. Dealer says this may be a "break in" issue, but I have never had a transmission have a "break in" period, so I am skeptical. installing the roof rack rails was VERY frustrating. Broke one of the rail covers putting the rails on. Poorly designed rail system. What's up with the rear blinkers. I do not feel safe with blinkers mostly on the side and not in the rear!!!!! What were their engineers thinking. I fell for the $3000 REBATE. I just hope I am wrong about this vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My husband and I bought the 2008 Hyundai in September. We put 10,000 down on it. Well, It has had nothing but problems. The transmission slips, there is a rattling noise coming from the engine, the wheel alignment does not stay in place, gas mileage sucked, and when the kids hooked up there dvd systems or game systems in the back it would cause a frying sound thru the speakers. We traded it in today and lost almost 18,000 on it. We lost all of our investment and only had it 6 months. We bought this 2008 as a demo with low miles.

<TEXT>Traded in a 2005 Santa Fe for this car, and this is a nice improvement. This car has a very nice, smooth ride and plenty of features. We got the premium package, mostly for the heated seats. Everything in the interior is well placed. Power is good enough with the 2.7, but I wouldn't mind a little more. The fact that my wife drives only 2 miles to work really hurts the MPG, but with more highway driving 20+ MPG is easy to do.

Transmission was defective and they would not recognize its problems or fix it. Bad design and quality problems. They may allege to have the best warranty in the business but that is because they won't fix any problems and keep saying that is the way the vehicle was made to operate.

<TEXT>I owned a 2005 Chevy Trailblazer LT, loaded to the max. Sunroof,dual zone auto climate. Everything but the kitchen sink was in this truck. I loved driving it but the gas was killing me and the lease was up. I own a 08 Elantra and I'm happy with it so I figured I would check out the Sante Fe. Fit and finish is good but I don't think the ride is so smooth. When I'm doing 60mph and up I can feel it. On my trailblazer when I was doing 60 it felt like I was going 30mph Gas Mileage is between 18 and 19mpg and this is mostly all highway, so I am not to impressed with the mpg.

<TEXT> The acceleration is smooth and if done properly, feels as if you are gliding in an airplane. No complaints with the noise level. It handles very well in ice and snow with proper driving skills. The downsides are that the gas mileage is not as good as I had hoped, the front seats seam to have a lot of give as you are entering and exiting the car (and I am not a heavy person). I have two chips in the windshield within a year vs. no chips in the windshield of my old Dodge Caravan after taking many heavy hits, and driving the same routes as I do in the Hyundai. </TEXT>

I must say I smile every time I get into this car. The entire dash and fit and finish is beautiful. (we have black leather w/ black dash) Blue lights contrast beautifully. Sound system great, gas mileage similar to what everyone else says...but something to be noted that not everyone says is the quietness of the ride.

<TEXT>So far I have not experienced any of the transmission issues that others are talking about. I have nothing but good things to say about this vehicle. I have custom 2 tone leather seats in it and they are fantastic. Have no issues with any of the instruments or controls. I'm averaging about 16.8 mpg (only 400 miles on the vehicle and nothing but city driving, no hwy miles really). The torque and hp is a LITTLE low but all that does is teach me to accelerate without a sense of being in a race all the time. That saves gas anyway so I think it's fine. At speed I have no problem getting in and out of traffic. By the way my previous vehicle was a VW Jetta VR6 and this gets better mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well. I am certainly impressed! Superb fit, finish and dealer prep. I bought with input using my friend's satisfied experience with his 2005 Santa Fe. After riding in my 2008, he complimented the leather interior, greater interior space, the cool blue instruments and knock-out sound system. My last ride was a beloved 1996 Mazda MPV AWD with 178,000 miles. But blue smoke and electrical gremlins in wet weather required a change. I extensively researched the specs on Edmunds.com of similar vehicles. I wanted a boost in gas mileage over the 15 MPG of my Mazda, with better interior dimensions and comforts. The 2008 Santa Fe was the same dimensions, but better 1st and 2nd row seating and +5 MPG.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Superb build quality. 5 passenger seating with TWO storage bins for what my wife calls my junk (jump cables, triangles, small tools, flux capacitor).

<TEXT>We drove several comparable vehicles in this category (Subaru Forester, Nissan Murano, Subaru Tribeca, Mazda CX-7, Chrysler Pacifica) and for the money the Santa Fe has them all beat, hands down. The features and options list would have cost thousands more in the other models. Driving off of the lot during the test drive, I felt as if this vehicle was in a completely different league compared to the others we had driven. FAVORITE FEATURES (too many to fit below) The interior materials, fit and finish are absolutely top notch. The Navigation option, while sometimes not the greatest at getting you where you need to go the fastest, definitely works well and intuitively. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>(cont) The 11 speaker Infinity sound system is phenomenal at mid to high volumes, though a little thin when lower. Auto HVAC system rocks, w/ third row vents. Reclining rear seats.

<TEXT>We purchased a new 2008 Santa Fe LTD AWD. The average MPG after 250 miles is 19.5 with a mix of city and freeway driving. I expect better MPG after the break in. The remote fuel door open switch did not work the first time we went to put gas in the tank. The dealer should have checked this before they delivered the car. We had to use the emergency fuel door pull cord behind the rear seat panel to open the fuel door. We noticed the seats are really uncomfortable after the first 100 miles. I hope they "soften up" over time. Except for the fuel door, everything else works on the vehicle. The CD, Radio and rear DVD sound great. The Santa Fe drives and handles well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Never thought I'd buy a Hyundai (after many Toyotas, Hondas and recently Subarus), but the 2008 Santa Fe Ltd. had all the features, mpg, comfort and room I was looking for. I'm getting 22 mpg average, and everything is rock solid after 3k miles. This car is *quiet* inside, and everything feels well thought out and well put together. The Ltd. has a great stereo, quality leather, all the options, and looks and feels like a Lexus EX. The CR-V and RAV4 are nice, but smaller and less comfortable - and they cut corners and it feels like it. The Santa Fe is less $, but nowhere does it feel cheap, and I continue to find things that make me say "hey, that's nice they thought of that."</TEXT>

<TEXT>First, mileage. I get about 24 on my daily commute, 16 strictly city, on cruise-control: 25.5 at 75mph, and 33 (!) at 60mph. Acceleration is more than adequate. If you really punch it you get torque- steer, but it isn't necessary to punch it. It's been trouble-free the first year/21,000 miles. The automatic climate system is MUCH better than the one in my Mercedes and the temperature readout much more accurate than my Mercedes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When my wife and I wanted a compact SUV the usual suspects were top on our list. Toyota, Honda, and Nissan were our first choice. But with one look at the New 08 Santa Fe and I was in love. The comfort level was out of this world. The seats are supportive yet cozy. The SE model came with the upgraded fabric which is soft and well appointed. Controls are laid out well and are easy to reach, especially with the steering wheel mounted controls. The cool blue gauges are easy on the eyes and nice too look at. Handling is also sharp and responsive. Looking at the reflectors for the reading lamps you will see that even the smallest details on this ute are polished and refined.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We looked pretty closely at 2 other vehicles in this class before buying the Santa Fe. The Subaru Forester didn't offer a V6 and was not as visually appealing. Still with just a 4 cylinder and the options we wanted, it was about $2000 more than the Santa Fe. We liked how the Toyota Rav4 looks, and liked how the V6 handled. But to get the same options as our SE Santa Fe, we would have had to get a Limited Rav4. That was almost $6000 more. Since this was tied with the Rav4 for consumer satisfaction in Consumer Reports, it seemed a no brainer to get this.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought an AWD Limited Santa Fe a year ago.It is an okay car. Some squeak and rattles, but I never had any mechanical failure. The sound is relatively good. Initially, it drives ok. I later found the the front seats were too high and very uncomfortable. It takes me a month to find that out and I develop a serious lower back pain that affects my sleep. The leather used in Santa Fe does not last. I decide to change car to ease my lower back pain. Most dealer were only willing to trade it for 1/3 of the price I paid. I end up give Hyundai another try since they gave highest trade in value. I still lost half of my investment. </TEXT>

Very quiet, smooth ride, love my heated leather seats even though I'm in the south. I didn't think I would use the heat but leather is cold in mornings. No transmission problems, it's a fantastic vehicle with great rebates. Oh, the stereo system with 6 disc and infinity speakers sounds awesome! Sunroof is quiet too. No complaints here at all. I would highly recommend this vehicle. My other top running choices were Rav 4 or Highlander but the price I paid for what I got beat Toyota by far.

This is a great car though much bigger than my 2007 Dodge Caliber that I traded in! Very comfortable ride and features.

<TEXT>I researched this vehicle purchase for two months. It boiled down to the Santa Fe and Dodge Journey because of our current experiences with both Hyundai and Dodge vehicles. Did not like the looks of the smaller SUV's such as the CR-V, RAV-4, & Escape. Drove the Journey and was sorely disappointed. Hyundai had the big rebates at the time, so it was a no- brainer. Good choice! The car is easy to drive, view from the driver's seat is great, averaging 21 mpg for the first 1,000 miles. All those reports about the bad transmission - not evident! This is a well-made, very comfortable, and whisper-quiet vehicle. And you can hardly beat the warranty! Totally satisfied 2nd Hyundai owner!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle and have had it a month. I am very pleased with the gas mileage (around 24-25mpg). This has not been highway driving. I think the interior is well designed and thought out. I love the fold down armrest in the back with cupholders. It is very easy to fold down the seats for carrying bigger items (much easier than the ford escape previously owned). I love the blue lights on the dash and interior. All in all, I am pleased with the vehicle. The warranty certainly adds to the attractiveness. I have owned numerous vehicles that developed issues after the 36,000 or 50,000 mile warranty and the dealer offers free loaner vehicles to boot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded in a Dodge Grand Caravan for the Santa Fe and so far its been a great family vehicle. The kids really appreciate the pillar mounted air vents in the back. I had the dealer change the computer options to automatically lock all the doors at the lowest speed setting (this option is not enabled by default and is a free service). Mostly in-town driving at about 18 MPG and 1 highway trip at about 26MPG. Our tires we also over- inflated by about 10 pounds. Lowering to the recommended pressure helped improve the ride. Interior is well crafted and quite with the blue lights adding a cool accent for night driving. Very happy with this purchase so far!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow, has Hyundai come a long way since the early 90's cheapo cars! Fit and finish of the Santa Fe are top notch, very solid and stable feeling on the road, great 3.3L engine (powerful and I'm getting 24.5 mpg avg., mostly hwy), best balance between interior space and exterior dimensions (between a CR-V and Pilot) for a family, and huge value for the price (beneath the CR-V). Almost a perfect "family roadtrip" vehicle that is also nice in the parking lots and side streets. However, if you do a daily commute in heavy traffic you might not appreciate the best parts of this car (it's quiet ride, 5-speed automatic, comfortably supportive seats), and you will definitely get worse mpg!</TEXT>

Drove nearly 1000 miles in the first week and love it! Interior fit and finish is Lexus-excellent, and outside it looks like most other "luxury mini- SUVs" after the redesign in '07.

I've got the SE 3.3 V6 and I've been averaging about 21 MPG in stop and go commuting. 5 issues that I've noticed so far. 1) Only lowing the rear windows sometimes causes a percussive booming against the back window. 2) No aux input or easy way to connect MP3 player to stock stereo. 3) Manual lumbar and height adjustment are worthless. 4) Seat Height adjustment lever is right where I place my behind when I get in. This might break over time. 5) Front window sill where the wipers park will fill with snow. Overall, these are small issues.</TEXT>

<TEXT>All in all a nice vehicle. The GLS is a smooth ride, and offers a fair amount of luxury at a competitive price. It's spacious cabin provides plenty of room and added compartments for the person looking for the mid-size utility vehicle. Add to that, an assortment of models and options available for those looking to customize their vehicle. It's a bit slow and sluggish on acceleration and could definitely stand to gain more horsepower. However, once up to speed it performs just fine. I'd rate the car an 8 out of 10. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the limited AWD, tried out all sorts of SUV. Warranty was part of the decision factor. For a 30,000 auto, you would think they would have put the lights to stay on after you turn off your key. Nope not there ( I was told it did but no it does not) Does not auto lock the doors after you reach the 12 or 15 miles an hour like most cars do. After reading the manual I find out that when you lock in AWD it turns off at 19 miles an hour. I could not believe it so I call Hyundai and they told me yes that it does. So what is the point in having AWD? I have had it 5 days now and ready to trade it in. Rides good except the back seat vibrates more than it should.</TEXT>

The only complaint I have is with the infinity sound system- I also have the high-pitched whine at lower volumes that others have alluded to. It gets very annoying and the dealer has replaced my entire system to no avail. They seem to think the amp is overpowered for the speakers and causing feedback. At high volume, the sound is great. Overall fun car and I'm thrilled with the value. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats make long trips MUCH more enjoyable. Tan interior is gorgeous with the black and chrome accents and black carpeting. Lots of storage space in back.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>...for making a car with this kind of transmission. I liked the Santa Fe until the experiences I have had with the transmission. It does ruin the driving experience. And to make matters worse, Hyundai service tells me nothing is wrong with it when there clearly is a problem. No transmission shifts like this. It clearly is slipping and it definitely does not help the poor gas mileage figures that the car already has. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After a frustrating time with my 02 Odyssey, we decided to get a new SUV. I have tested a fair amount of SUVs in the market and the Santa Fe was my top choice. I bought it and the experience is amazing. 3 months with it and it's still pretty flawless. The fuel economy is so-so but what do you expect from a AWD? This CUV is definitely worth looking at. It's the bang for the buck. I love it. My first Hyundai... really impressed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Hyundai and my favorite so far. I had a Sonata and a GLS 350. I have had 3 Volvos, 3 BMWs and a Porsche Boxster and frankly for the money, its an excellent car. I have all the options in high end cars. I saw someone complain about their service but I have had wonderful service. Twice they have fixed things for free that would not have been covered under warranty. As long as all goes well with this car, I will probably buy another.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I agree with all the other posters as there is a definite problem with this transmission design. It does not function properly when cold. It is absolutely stupid that Hyundai would put a vehicle on the market with this transmission design. They knew this problem existed and stuck the fools (like me) who decided to purchase it. Never again. I will never buy another Hyundai. This is not a trustworthy company.</TEXT>
