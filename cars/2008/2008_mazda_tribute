<TEXT>I purchased a brand new 2008 Tribute a little over 2 years ago, in the past year I have had problem with faulty valve stems on 3 of the tires, peeling plastic and paint on the exterior, sealing problems with the doors and back window hatch, and just today the driver door almost completely came off! I had to lift the door up and push it in just to get it shut good enough to drive home. I have never had so many car troubles in my life until I bought a mazda. My advice...look elsewhere! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the sporty look of the vehicle, thats about the only good thing I can say about it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my 2002 tribute, V6 for this car and am disappointed in the MPG. It is worse than my 2002 and is a 4 cyl. Its nice looking but I wanted better MPG than I am getting. I may trade it in sooner than later.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>the cloth seats are great. Nice change from the leather I had which was too hot.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've put almost 1,000 miles on my 2008 Mazda Tribute. The Good: I love the looks white with black trim and tinted rear windows. It has performed adequately so far with no problems. It has decent acceleration at 200HP, while handling like a car and gets almost as good fuel economy as my 1999 Chevy Malibu (V6). The interior is roomy in both front and back seats. The complaints: Mazda claims to have a college graduate incentive program, but they do not in the USA. I'm not thrilled with the speedometer as it only displays in multiples of 20MPH, I guess writing in multiples of 10 would be too hard??? I do get a lot of reflection from the white hood. All-in-all I would buy it again. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the boxy SUV styling unlike the CX7. 6 disk CD changer, tow package, and MP3 jack are wonderful. Car-like handling with raised seating platform. Comfortable front and rear seating. Ability to fold down rear seats (This is my first SUV). Lots of safety features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have constantly had problems with our tribute. The transmission cooler leaks. Actually I believ the component is recalled. We had it fixed once but the problem is still there. Beware if you plan to buy a Mazda tribute. If you live in the northwest territories make sure you can service the truck in the northwest territories. I have had to drive to grand praire Alberta so they can service the truck and look at the tranny leak. They said it was fine but the leak is still there. Mazda Canada said that I would have to always drive to grand praire to get it serviced escpecially if it was a warranty part. We payed from our own pockets $700.00. Mazda Canada reinbursed us $94.00. Beware</TEXT>

<TEXT>The look - the exterior is much cooler than the 2002 which I previously owned, but no vinyl side panels that saved me a bundle when I got hit in the older one (no damage!). The interior - I love the high gloss look, but the sunglass holder door drops open every time I hit a bump. You still have to take the head rests off the back when putting the seat down. The rear cup holders on the console don't have the sleeve that the front ones do, so its very difficult to clean what the kids manage to put in there. Driving - it handles like a dream. I love driving this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The stereo MP3 Player and iPod attachment, the cup holder sleeve, overdrive feature, intelligent 4WD, chocolate leather interior, heated seats, I could go on all day.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my Tribute for 14 months and I still love it the same as I did a year ago. It's very reliable, good gas mileage and was a good choice for me and my family. I have a 6yr and a 1year old, even on long trips, it's a little small.. but good on gas (which is most important to us) I would buy from this Mazda again because my buying AND service experience has been great!!! I would recommend this car to anyone that wants a economical small SUV!</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>PAINT IT AINT</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I am very disappointed with this purchase, paint has been chipping and continues to bubble on pieces that had been repainted noise in front sounds like needing new breaks this was all in 3 months of purchasing. Headlights had to be completely replaced, washer fluid leaks on hood, tie down in back fell off and again paint bubbling all with in 6 months of owning vehicle. If own the lt sage, please go over it and check for bubbles of pin head paint. It squeaks like an old truck on very hot days and long rides in stop and go traffic, does not have pickup, the dash color reflects on the windshield which is somewhat distracting. Never will I purchase a Mazda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Grand Touring model with V-6 black with leather interior. Worked beautifully until a few months ago. The transmission went out in July of 2008. It started with jerking on acceleration, the tires would screech loudly. I had no idea what was happening. I didn't have the truck for two weeks as they re-built the transmission. Not even a year old at the time. I took it back in two weeks ago in August because the jerking was happening again and it still stalled out at stop lights. I cannot believe this. The dealer "fixed" a starter belt or something but that has done nothing because the jerking/stalling are worse now. So, I need to take this back for a third fix. I am not happy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a dream to drive. It feels like floating down the highway. The interior is spacious and comfortable. The V6 engine is not as responsive as I would like but I have been used to driving a smaller suv but its 4 cyl. engine had better "get up and go" (Toyo RAV4). The Tribute is well insulated from road noise, a very quiet ride. Stereo system sounds great too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the Tribute i sport with 5-speed manual transmission,fwd, and 4-cyl engine because I wanted a vehicle with cargo capacity and respectable fuel economy. The dealer where I made the purchase had to locate the vehicle with this combination, because they had never had a Tribute on their lot with a manual transmission. There is not a photo available of the manual shift lever and console combination available in the Mazda brochure. But Mazda did a good job with the 5-speed package, the shift lever is well finished and attractive with a good relationship to the steering wheel. The clutch pressure is very light and makes shifting gears easy. Now have 1709 miles and my average MPG is 30.97</TEXT>

<TEXT>This SUV is perfect for city driving, and does great on the highway. The engine is not over powered if you're running the air conditioner in the city, but that's not that important, but the pick-up is there if you need it. I love the the black trim around the vehicle, your seeing less of this,the monochromatic look is not for me. The engine is not loud and you don't hear excessive road noise. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Nice SUV. Lots of room and very comfortable. AC blows very cold. Good exterior design. Rear seats should recline and fold down easier without removing head rests. Grab handles should not have been left out. Exterior temp would have been nice. Stereo sounds very good. Gauge cluster doesn't look Mazda at all, very Ford. Sportier steerig wheel with audio controls. Lots of standard safety features for the money. Rear brakes should have been disc not drum. Having noises from rear breaks that has been looked at by the dealer twice. Carpet in front foot wells pulling away from the door frame plastic. Very nice Mazda that feels like a Ford. Excellent value for what you get.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Two weeks after I bought this car I started experiencing hard starting and a loud clicking sound in the passenger/driver door. I took it to Mazda service center and they confirmed my concerns. They serviced this car 3 times for the same issue and up to now they haven't resolved the problem. First they said it was the battery, then second it was the software that needs to be updated. The third time the technician cannot fix the problem and they have to involve the manufacturer's engineer. Very disappointing since this car is supposed to be brand new. Almost everyday the car has difficulty starting. As for the door clicking noise no parts available to replace it until ?????</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the GT Mazda Tribute because of the standard features/price.But for a "grand" version, it is lacking. No lighted vanity mirrors. One coat hook in the entire car.Body side molding would help protect doors from dings. Interior looks like it was put together with spare parts, all different colors. Glare on driver side mirror reflecting AC vent inside car. Several mirror adjustments can't get rid of it. Would help if side mirror unit could be moved outward like on Chevy Blazers. To keep the cost of the vehicle down, I guess some features were not cost effective. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Regular gas, 6 CD changer, console, heated seats, sunroof. Nice ride. Like that all the doors do not unlock when the car is turned off. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have gone from $70 plus for a fill up to $40.00, from 12 mpg to 24. In the three weeks I have had it, we have been thru 4 inches of snow and two days of near 80 degree weather and it has kept me warm, cool and got me from point A to point B even while driving 15 miles per hour on the freeway. What?s not to like. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the way it looks from the front and the way it feels inside. Black with Charcoal interior. I may die this summer but it looks classy! The stereo just plain looks impressive but is actually easy to use. A touch of the button and the rear window pops up, nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just got this SUV a few days ago. What I can tell you is that I absolutely love it. I had a Honda Element and the Tribute blows it away. The Honda 4 cyl. isn't enough for the weight of the Element. I also had a CRV and the Tribute blows the doors off it. It has exceptional power to it without hesitation. No problem getting on the highways or passing. I have no intention of towing with it. The inside is way above the inside of the Honda's. The Tribute has a more elegant look to it and tons of leg room and cargo space. The long list of standard equipment provided is what also makes the Tribute and excellent choice for the money!

<TEXT>So far I am very happy with my purchase and enjoy driving my Tribute very much. A lot of expert reviews complain about the engine and handling but I find the 6 cylinder to be very peppy when you step on the gas. Its no musclecar, but its more than satisfactory. Handling seems very solid, as it stays very flat through turns. Steering feel is also excellent. I bought it for the space, comfort and ability to handle offroad situations once in a while. Most SUVs that reviewers say are better than the Tribute can not go offroad. The price can definitely not be beat either. AWD Grand Touring edition at more than $2700 off MSRP! I feel like I got a lot of car for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Offroad ability, confident handling, unique interior, heated seats, aux input for the stereo, comfortable leather seats, exterior design still looks masculine (not all curvy like many SUVs nowadays), and the PRICE! I can easily overlook the improvements section because of the amazing price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The AWD V-6 Grand s touring model is top notch in its class. I upgraded from the 2003 Tribute this year and I am very pleased. The car/truck gets lots of compliments and its new styling is a hit. The drive is smooth and the cockpit is sporty and overall is a great drive. Small glare during the day from the dash color on the glass but I'm sure I will get used to it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Look of vehicle is appealing. V-6 power on a smaller frame has plenty of pick up. AWD is now automatic as opposed to the older push button 4WD Tribute I had which is improved technology.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>All options were basic and standard. I am missing many nice features when I compared my Mazda to the Ford Escape. The car can out perform a Honda on the highway. The car felt solid on the ground when making sharp turns. The engine felt smoother with synthetic Mobile One 0W-20. The transmission is slow and heavy. The power of the engine is felt best on the highway. Solid when driven on sand or rocks. It needs many changes in my opinion. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The option of heating the seat on a cold day/nice. The option of the moon roof that opens automatically/nice. Loud music system/nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a wonderful SUV. The first road trip I got 25 mpg with not even 1000 miles on the vehicle! Handles very easily on the road and while driving in town. Very smooth ride. Comfortable seats. Love the heated front seats on cold mornings. Great acceleration. Love the interior. The lighted instrument panel is nice at night. Heater really heats up fast on cold mornings. This is really a great SUV for in town driving or out on the road. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I evaluated the Tribute after 400 miles earlier here. I have dutifully, every fill up, recorded fuel consumption for over 5000 miles now. The mileage is incredible and I have only done a few minor things to it --put in a K&N filter (at 4000 mi) and Mobil 1 at 3000 mi. Here are the stats: overall avg. mpg 28.5. High: 33.11 mpg, low 25.5 mpg. On last tank full, averaged 32.6 (90% highway). If I drive between 60 & 65 and get it into 5th at 30 mph, I can get 32+. Between 65 & 70, I can get 30-32 mpg. Driven between 70 & 75, 28-30 mpg is possible. Above 75, it tails off as you would expect. This has got to be the most economical small SUV with a stick shift. Very pleased with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I always wanted a Tribute but I like the 2006 exterior better than the 2008. The 2008 looks too much like a box. I really like the exterior look of the 2007 Honda CRV, but I like the interior of the Tribute. I made the purchase because it was the best deal for the money. I like the feel of sitting high and seeing far in front me. I don't have 4WD and sometimes it feels like the car skids or sways if I'm traveling at a high speed and need to come to a sudden stop. This makes me a little nervous. It's not too bad on gas either. It's really growing on me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only driven this 2.3 L Sport 5 spd 400 miles or so. Traded a Mazda3 hatchback 5 speed with a variation on the 2.3 less torque and more hp. That engine is very sweet in the tribute and the shift linkage is nice. It's quiet at speed with a nice ride and quick good steering feel. And the epa nos. (22, 28) lead me to believe that 30 mpg on the highway will be possible. The interior is nicely designed and colorful (yellow/black upholstery/dash). If the fuel efficiency is similar to 3s, then Mazda/Ford have hit a home run by adding the 2.3L engine and stunning body upgrade. Great value!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Research led me to the CX-7, but turned away from the premium gas requirement. Looked at/drove the Tribute and although "boxey," unlike the sleek CX-7, I insisted on a vehicle that operated on regular gas. I've had mine since the end of April and have had a couple of road trips. The ride is smooth and quiet, it's roomy, handles well, seats 5. V6 has the power to get you through traffic, not real impressed with the brakes, a bit mushy. The leather interior really dresses it out. A very good value in comparison to other small Japanese SUVs. Fun to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Over the years, we have owned 3 Mazda Proteges and 2 MPV vans. Mazda has always delivered the highest quality vehicles we have owned and we expect no less of our new 2008 Tribute. We decided on a fully optioned Grand touring model in the the i series with the 2.3 liter 4 cylinder. I find acceleration to be quite responsive and I'm sure to appreciate the better economy. Unless you need a tow vehicle, I highly recommend this combination. I'm surprised by some of the less than complimentary professional reviews regarding styling cues as I find the vehicle to be gorgeous (gloss black over "stone" leather). All in all, an A+ experience to date.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Best, mirror-finish black paint job I've owned. Really smooth. Smaller exterior proportions for confident parking, yet interior room in the driver's compartment is outstanding. I'm 6'3" and my large frame is very comfortable in the seat, and headroom is great, even with the sunroof on my model. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought the Mazda Tribute i because of our recent addition to the family. We had a Ford Ranger Edge. THis SUV is great! We where going to get the CX-7, I'm glad we got into this vehicle. It's roomy, the styling is great. The aux input jack comes in handy. It's even Satellite radio equipped. I put in a TomTom GPS navigation device, It's the vehicle we needed, great features. Side impact air bags for protection. All in all Mazda, went over our expectations. Definitely recommend this SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The wife and I have been doing research on small SUVs and we purchased a great one! The Tribute has a ton of standard features and Mazda did a great job with instilling the "sport" into driving, even in this SUV. We weren't expecting it to go fast since we opted for the 4 cyl but so far we are impressed. It doesn't have a problem passing, merging, etc. Also the interior quality is 10+. It feels like the knobs to turn the vents are wrapped in leather. And the glossy black dash isn't cheap, it's sturdy polished ABS. Love the car! If you are comparing it to other manufacturers this one has a ton of standard features for less cost than the others.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my new car for about 2 weeks now. I bought the black on black but had the dealer cover the white seats and dash with black leather. I love the drive and the comfort. It is a great suv without having to pay big bucks. A lot of room inside and very sharp dashboard design. I have the 6 cyl. There is a lot of pick up. Also very easy to handle on the road. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this midsize suv. Not sure on the gas mileage yet although we are taking a road trip in a couple of weeks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Driving is great especially considering the choices if you want an entry level SUV from a foreign car maker. As expected pick-up is slow. Even thought it's Japanese, it reminded me of my 1995 Ford Taurus, design seemed very similar to Ford. And as expected instruments in the car are not as sturdy and are more of Ford quality. But it's too soon to say anything, it's only been driven 350 kms!</TEXT>
