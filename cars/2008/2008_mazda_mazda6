<TEXT>I like my Mazda. Bought it new, and now at 14k miles, having some problems. Warped front rotors, squeaking belts, steering clunk, transmission hesitant to go in gear from reverse to drive. The clunk happens mostly at low speeds, and comes from the passenger front. The tranny problem is not too good. It goes into gear when it is good and ready. It is a fun car to drive (handling) but the auto trans seems to always try to be in top gear so I am turning fewer revs. Do I really need to be in 5th gear while driving 35, turning 1800 revs? That's why I usually go 'manual' around town. It shifts to higher gears too quickly.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handles great, looks good, A/C is pretty strong, stereo is ok for stock, seats are very comfy, red dash at night is easy on the eyes.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd review for this car. Its been great, the engine is smooth and responsive. The car remains a blast to drive. The 2.3 liter is responsive and economical. I am averaging around 25 mpg in mixed city and highway driving and 29.5 mpg on an 800 mile trip. You will not win any races at the stoplight against a Mustang GT, but on the highway is where this car really shines. I find myself looking for roads with alot of curves. This car takes corners like its on rails. I have also found myself, many times driving on triple digits, without realizing it. Comfort, speed, fun, economy and pure adrenalin, all rolled up into one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Durability & Fun to drive. I have driven Mazda for over 20 years, GLC's, ( go like crazy ), 626's and now a Mazda 6 my last new car. They have all gone over 200,000 with minimum care & maintenance. I'm taking better care of this one since it is supposed to last until I die and I am only 62. A healthy 62 I might add. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first brand new car, I first drove a rental from Hertz and was impressed. The car has met and exceeded my expectations, I've put on 24,000 miles and the car still drives like brand new, I've driven cross country, in snow, on country roads, the car has never failed my expectations. The interior is classy, bose, sirius, and the controls are superb, I would take this anyday over the 2009. Th dealership and follow up experience was excellent, I dont think I could have asked for anything better for value. If there are any left and you are looking for a 4 door, this is the one to buy !!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I picked up a 2008 Mazda6 last week. The car is an absolute hoot to drive. I was driving a Pontiac Grand Am before and there is no comparison. The Mazda6 is lightweight, handles superbly and is FAST for a 4-cylinder. The manual capability on the automatic transmission is nice and I've used it a couple of times to downshift for passing, etc. The interior seems to be laid out well and it has some quality to it. I'm disappointed that an AUX plug for my iPod didn't come with it. But, the Value Edition does have an in-dash 6 CD changer and so I've just burned a bunch of CDs in iTunes and I'll listen to my music that way. Gas mileage seems to be average. Definitely consider this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>While it may be a bit premature having just bought the car a week ago... but WOW is all I can think to say. Beautiful on the inside & out. Comfortable, roomy, classy, smooth ride... everything within reach. I researched cars for 2 months prior before finally 'settling' on the Mazda 6 & fell in love as soon as I got in. Drives as beautifully as the Volvo S40. 24.5 miles per gallon (city) & Miami traffic is constant stop & go. I'm completely impressed with this car. I love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car in 12/2008; I sold it in less than 6 months. The car handles great, pickup is ok; but when there's even little snow on the street; if its raining or if there are potholes and you're going over 45mph; it seems like you're drifting. Imagine if you driving a semitruck and on every bump you noticed the trailer wavering. Its not as bad as that but close. I didn't feel safe driving it. Since I bought this car, I have heard the same compliant from other people I've met with a Mazda 6 and today for the first time someone with a Mazda 3 mentioned the same thing. When I bought the car, people were raving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my car! My previous car was a Mazda Millenia (which I loved) so when I started looking for a new used car I kept coming back to the Mazda 6. The drivers seat is very comfortable. I love the controls on the steering wheel. This car ia a joy to drive and beautiful to look at! I love the body style of the 2008 over the 2009 (and it's competitors). My only complaint was the same with my Millenia - Mazda please make the turn radius on your cars tighter! If you have to do a U turn in a tight space it will turn into a 3 point turn. Other than that this car rocks!!!!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have this car 6 month 8500 miles and still love it. I have owned 15 new cars in my life and this holds 2nd place as my favorite. 1990 Chevy Lumina Euro holds first place. Great car fun,fun,fun for a 4 door family car. Being a 38 year old guy with 2 kids and a wife it fits the bill. Wife drives a crossover. Glad to buy the 2008 and save big$$$. No problems, no complaints. Good room in front looks great. I have to recommend putting on a spoiler it changes the whole look of the car. The Zoom Zoom makes it happen, go Mazda</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had the Mazda6 for one week. t he exceleration is just about what I expect from the 4 cylinder engine. The engine is smooth in daily driving. you do notice the engine on exceleration, but it is not taxing our too intruding. I like the red colored gauges at night. I like the radio controls on the steering wheel. The 5 speed automatic transmission is smooth, but I particularly like being able to shift it manually if I wanted. the wear seats are roomy. I have good room in the drivers seat. The drivers seat is easy to adjust for comfort. The wear seats are roomy anough, although I will be driving up front. Highway driving is a breeze. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It made a few squeaks on the passenger front fender at first, but Royal Moore fixed it without questions or charge. Herzog-Meier made some fake warranty of 100 miles or less so I couldn't take it to them. Fuel economy could be better, but when you put the pedal to the metal, it shows its real performance. Flawless control at high speeds, like the car was a part of your own body. Sportiest looking sedan I could find.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my car yesterday after doing lots of research and I don't regret it. Buying a used 08 with low mileage fully loaded was a much better deal than getting a new 09 base model. The 08 is more fun to drive and it feels very sporty. Plus it has better gas mileage than the 09. </TEXT>

<TEXT>If you're looking for something with great visual appeal and that's more fun-to-drive than any other mid-sized sedan in this segment, this is your car. Best of all, the hatchback design looks great while offering more cargo space than any other vehicle in this class. I've driven this vehicle over 10,000 miles since new and have had no mechanical problems (though the roof liner sagged slightly on driver's side, but was replaced at no charge). Really a driver's car; some might find the seating a bit tight, esp. in the back (compared to other sedans), but not a problem for me. I still look for any excuse to drive this car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior and interior design. Hatchback design has amazing cargo capacity (and looks better than the sedan). Best handling in this price range. Bose stereo. Electroluminescent gauges.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I LOVE this car!!! I have been an SUV driver for 10 years now and was feeling the crunch at the pump. It has been a little weird switching to a car, but I forget about that instantly when I'm hugging turns and driving this thing like it's on rails. I bought the car on the 30th and a week and a half later I have only gone through 1/4 of a tank!!yeah! Anyone who is in a SUV ditch it, the car is a lot more fun!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second 6. I had a 2006 Mazda 6 and recently purchased a 2008 6. I have just 2,000 miles and once AGAIN, my brakes are shuttering and pulsating and my steering wheel has vibration from the brakes.I had the same issue with my 2006. Now I have to again bring the car in to be checked. The only concern is after I repaired the 2006, new brakes, rotors, I had to after, 1,500 miles have the new rotors re-surfaced! I am hoping I do not have the same issue all over. Mazda needs to fix this problem! I do not think I will purchase another Mazda. This is a pain, to say the least, also quite expensive to repair.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my car. It has almost all of the options I wanted in a car. I like the appearance of the car far more than the new 09 Mazda 6, even thought it is a bit more powerful. I chose this car over the Camry, Altima, Accord and a few other midsize sedans. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the black on black interior, even though it is a nightmare to keep clean. The 6 CD changer, the optional shifter and the handling is the best I've ever had a chance to witness. The car really is fun to drive and pretty smooth.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had owned a 2002 Mazda Protege ES. That car was such a well controlled handler, but was starting to get too punishing on midwestern roads hammered by a hard winter. The 08 Mazda6 is almost as fun to whip around as the Protege, but a much easier car to live with - better balance between fun and comfort. But of course handling still beats the pants off an Accord or (yawn) Camry! Size was just-right for me, and comfy enough in back that I don't feel guilty putting passengers back there like I used to.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I didn't fall in love with it until they pulled it up for me at the dealership. Got almost 31 mpg on a 5 hour drive to KC which shocked me. CEL came on, dealership reset w/o problem. Dashboard can easily be seen during day. I think people are driving with their headlights on which does dim the radio lights but you have to roll the knob on the dash up and it shows up, just as bright as at night. Turning radius is not the greatest. Kind of expecting one more turn of the wheel and then it stops. Very hollow sound on the roof during rain and driving through puddles. Interior's nice and I love being able to close a vent and not have air continue to blow out. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Two months into this car with a little over 4200 miles on the odometer. Only negative was a bad AC compressor at 2k miles but was fixed within 4 hours. Car drives and rides nice with plenty of room for the family including the boys baseball gear and a couple of chairs. I was looking at used Pontiac G6s when I found this one and couldn't be happier. Average mileage with 5 speed with mostly city driving is a low of 25 mpg and a high of 29 mpg so far with things only looking better as the car gets more broken in. So much better than the Maxima at 19 - 23 mpg which also asked for premium fuel. VERY happy with my new MAZDA6! </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Value Edition comes very noticeable and usable features such as a power front driver seat, 6 cd changer, and 17" alloys. This immediately puts the Mazda above many of its 4 cylinder competitors. The ride is smooth, the seats are great for sitting in traffic and long road trips, and I've averaged between 28-32 MPG for mixed driving! The styling is very trendy and the black casing for the tailights and headlights make it look extra sporty! This car is perfect for both commuting to/from work and for cruising around the city. The 5 speed manual shifts smoothly out of 1st and you can really feel the power at the top of 2nd and throughout 3rd. Engine is powerful enough for a 2.3L, 4 cylinder.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The multi-function steering wheel allows you to switch between different audio modes, volume, tracks, and there's a mute button! All very cool. The sound system thumps pretty loud for some stock speakers! Also, the backseat is spacious for a couple of buddies and the trunk could probably fit 2 more!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Feeling the gas price crunch, I had to look at getting rid of my FX35 and get something with mileage. Looked at Accord, Camry, Altima, Fusion, Malibu, and finally came across Mazda. This is a fun car to drive, the steering is a little overboosted, but great mileage (avg 24mpg mixed), good brakes, comfortable, but a little sluggish. Feels lighter and smaller than it is. Glad I bought it, and saving lots of money each month!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought a Mazda6, went from a Acura TL 2004 to this but gas prices were killing me, I do miss the power of the TL's V6 but this Mazda6 is really good looking and gives me a very decent mileage. I love the black on black combination. I was surprised at the quality of the cloth material used in the seats. I compared to the Camry and even though the Camry its bigger with a more powerful engine and better gas mileage the pricing factor makes the Mazda a better deal, I bought mine for 16,200 and it comes with 6 discs cd changer, 17 inches rims with michelin tires, dual exhaust system, well it is pretty loaded and for 16,200 WOW!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my '08 Mazda6 GTS within the last few weeks; I took delivery on Saturday 5/3. This car flies down the road without even noticing it. In addition, I tell people it is like you are floating and not even driving cause of how amazing the ride is. On the GT it has the "cockpit red" for all the gauges and readouts which keeps things clear and easy on the eyes, esp at night. The Bose sound system is ridiculous which definitely gets people's attention when driving with the windows down. The leather seats are very comfortable and you can sit in them for a prolonged time without aching or stiffening up. The HID headlights are awesome for night driving clearly lighting up the road.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Actually, this probably isn't a bad little car. The problem may be that I'm comparing it to my previous car, a Saab 9-3, which cost the SAME amount of money to lease as the Mazda! I guess I didn't appreciate it's turbo engine and excellent gas mileage while I had it. I'm certainly feeling like I'm getting less for the same price. The Mazda's a "cute" car, but not overly impressive for the price. It's slow on the uptake, but rides nicely once it gets going. The seats are comfy and it definitely is a fun car to drive. The dash, however, looks like what it is, cheap plastic. Frankly, I'm having "leaser's remorse". Unfortunately I have another 3 years in this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Mazda6 is an excellent value. I bought the car loaded with everything except nav. Yet the car still lacks an upscale feel. The real appeal of this car is the handling which is outstanding for this type of car and the versatility of the hatch. With a more powerful motor, this car could have been exceptional. With the 6 cylinder engine, it is just a lot of fun to drive. A bigger motor would have really given the car a strong identity.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just traded in my V6 Grand Am GT gas hog for a 2008 6I Sport Value Sedan. So far so good! Body styles are very similar. I like the sporty sedan style, but need ample backseat room for a carseat and passengers. I like the dash setup and there is still storage for my car clutter. My very favorite perk is the remote start, which works even from inside my office, =>100 ft away! Haven't decided whether or not I really love the VERY quiet engine (the vvrroooommm of a V6 is a beautiful thing!); the pickup is pretty good for a V4. Most of my miles are highway, so I'm looking forward to not having to visit the gas station so often. This isn't so much a 'fun' car; I'll leave that to my Jeep Wrangler!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 8-way power drivers seat, 6 CD changer, ample backseats, and ambient temp reading is great! My husband was glad to see me in a car with side bags/curtains.

<TEXT>I just bought the 6-Sport Value edition. I really like the car's exterior appearance. Mine is black with the rear spoiler. Interior is nice but not overwhelming. I did not look at the upgraded models so I don't want to rate the interior too much since mine is pretty much just standard equipment but is still comfortable enough for the daily commute. The sunroof is nice but not really needed much in Seattle area. The drive is nice even with the small 4 cyl. 2.3 lt. engine, smooth shifting and gets up to speed just fine. Headroom is a little tight if your a taller person and rear seat area is a little cramped but is fine for a family with two young children. Fun to drive... zoom-zoom!</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far, so good. I've only driven it about 600 mi. but according to my numbers, I'm getting more like 27 mpg around town. I have tested it at 1/4 tank and 1/2 tank. Being an 18 gal. tank, I'm averaging 500 mi. per tank. I haven't had the car on the highway yet. Time will tell. The car is very responsive and fun to drive. Very comfortable to drive. The 8 way drivers seat offers good adjustments. I'm 6'1" tall with long legs. Plenty of room.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Mazda 6 is the most fun car I have ever had. The 5 speed manual paired with the torquey V6 makes the car a dream to drive, but is not to overbearing to the point you can't use it as a family car. It is very roomy inside, plenty of room for kids in the back, and the trunk is vast. Could use just a little more in the way of economy though. Otherwise a phenomenal car!</TEXT>

The only thing that I think it could improve on is the sound system. At high volume it isnt great.</FAVORITE>
