<TEXT>After putting on over 20000 miles since purchase, I wanted to state that this vehicle is still enjoyable to operate. The vehicle still "feels" new and has not given us any problems. We use it to travel extensively around the country attending basketball tournaments that my granddaughter plays in. Always comfortable for the occupants and plenty of room for the gear.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had my 2008 Platinum 2 years now and I'm truly as happy with it as the day I bought it. Sure, it's pricey (I still can't get over my $850 mo. payment) but there is nothing on the road that even compares with it. If it had a Lexus badge (which it should) no one would even question it. It has plenty of power, an awesome transmission that never misses and is extremely comfortable.I love when my friends who have Lexus, Mercedes and one last week who has a Land Rover, get in and look around then say "This is nice- what car is this"? The Platinum series is that nice! It's the best overall car I've owned. Oh yeah the Navigation- IT STINKS! drives me crazy! Get a TOMTOM for the dash. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powerful motor, Smooth transmission, Platinum series has everything, very comfortable, I'm proud of it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had for a couple of months now and it has operated flawlessly. I had an 06 and liked it, but felt it was not as safe as I would like it to be. This has all the safety whistles that I need, plus it is a MUCH smoother, quiet, and comfortable drive. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to buy a large SUV. I have a friend who has an Escalade, and he prefers my Toyota. Averaging about 18 MPG on mostly highway driving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased this vehicle a couple months ago and I'm very happy with it, especially on long trips. I was lucky enough to add leather interior and 20 inch wheels from a Tundra Pickup, complements of Power Toyota & Arizona Sun tops. It is very powerful and handles very well for its size, it is very quiet on the highway and the JBL system sounds quite well for a factory system. There is plenty of space for my music equipment and is also relatively easy to park due to its short turning ratio.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable seats and plenty of leg room. Excellent drive train design with a quality feel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my 2001 Sequoia SR5 when they first came out, put 210,000 miles on it and was sad to trade it in on my new 2008 Limited in May of 2009. With gas prices going up we were actually looking for a smaller SUV but kept saying "we could get another Sequoia for that price". We bought our 2008 off the lot for the same price we paid for our 2001 SR5. We have already traveled 600 miles to 2 Lacrosse tournaments with 3 young men, gear and everyone loves it. We didn't like the new design at first but with the optional 20" wheels it is really starting to grow on us. The ride quality and the quiet interior are in a category of a much more expensive vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We live in a very rural area on dirt roads. We were amazed at how this vehicle allows the dust to come in. The rattles in the car are very irritating. The bluetooth does NOT work. The person on the other end says that it sounds like you are in a tunnel and cannot hear. Toyota cannot fix the problems! The towing is amazing which is the only reason I am keeping the car. You pay 52000 for a car, you expect a little more - not dust and rattles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We absolutely love our new Sequoia! We had a 2005 4Runner that was fine, but we now have 2 1/2 year old twins along with a 65 pound lab and definitely wanted more space everywhere within a new vehicle. My husband and I are truly die-hard Toyota fans, and were waiting for the new Sequoias to arrive. We are extremely pleased with the way it rides, the comfort of all the seats and were really impressed with how easy it was to actually drive. We both thought it may, for the lack of a better description, "float" as you drove it. However, it is very easy and fun to drive. It provides tons of space and just enough gadgets to keep everyone happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Had a 01 Sequoia SR5 and loved it, but wanted to upgrade to the limited. Drove an 07 and then the 08 and that was it, we were sold. The power difference, ride control, steering feel, and did I say power difference was night and day. Once we saw the fold flat 2nd & 3rd row seats, we knew we had to get it as we hated to have to always take out and put back the 3rd row seats from our first Sequoia. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 2004 Sequoia in for this 2008 Limited 4WD and so far really like the 2008. In town and interstate driving I average 15mpg. I love the six speed on the console and down shift alot to save brakes and it is very simple to do. The 381HP is smooth and more than enough power. The transmission is very smooth shifting. I liked my 2004 so much I was a little hesitant to trade, but I wouldn't go back now that I have had this 2008 for three weeks. Room out the kazoo. The turning radius is great, three foot less than my 2004.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation system is great, pretty easy to use also. Blue tooth is nice. The ride is quiet. I'm amazed how much I use the electric rear hatch as opposed to manual useage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the best full size suv on the market today. Buy the 5.7 380 plus HP engine for the incredible acceleration and the better gas mileage than the 4.7 litre. The interior in the limited is awesome, with illuminated dash similar to Lexus and hands free bluetooth phone system. The truck rides like a Bentley for 1/4 the cost.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Needed something larger and wanted to be able to tow about 7000 lbs. This looked to be the right mix, but we had concern over first year and whether it was all it appeared on paper. Was looking at either an Expedition, Armada, or the new Sequoia. The Seq rear axle is all new and very capable but new design for Toy and a little concerning, so I hope for the best there. But we think we made the right choice. Power is very smooth and ample for this huge SUV. It is wider then a Suburban. Drives sturdy and handles very well. Brakes stop very well. Very quiet engine compared to the other SUVs in class.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior style, mostly front end. Climate controls are very nice and vents are Everywhere in the front, 2nd and 3rd row cabin! Quietness. Storage is overly abundant in closable areas everywhere. 12volt outlet in the center console is nice for charging out of sight. Headlights are very illuminating.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned this vehicle for less than 24 hours and I have only driven it home from the dealership but that's 50+ miles of everything from Interstate to rough dirt roads, and winding, washboard mountain byways in between. On and off pavement, dirt, snow and ice, I have never become so comfortable, so "at home", felt so secure and in command so quickly in my almost 50 years behind one wheel or another. Also, I have never been in a car/truck that was so thoughtfully designed with the American motorist/family in mind. "Fuel Economy" and reliability just guesses at this stage, With apologies to "Field of Dreams and Iowa: "Is this heaven? No. This is a 4WD Platinum Sequoia." </TEXT>

<TEXT>My new Sequoia 08 Limited drives just fabulously! I love the torque that this baby provides when I step on the gas. Overall the vehicle is youthful, rugged, and yet still refined. I did get the 20" wheels, and overall they ride extremely nice, and look awesome. The vehicle interior is extremely quiet compared to my 2004 Yukon Denali XL. The backup camera performs admirably, and is a must with 3 little kids! The integrated bluetooth feature is a must if you are on your phone a lot, it is just fabulous. I do like the look and feel of this new body style. I purchased the Pyrite Mica color, and think is looks fabulous. (looks better in person than online) My kids love the 3rd row seat!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Number one feature has to be the look. I think they just look awesome. After that, I would say the engine is a huge plus and performs great. I love the integrated bluetooth, Navi system, and backup camera. I also purchased an extra set of floor mats for winter use. (rubberized) 3rd row seat!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was interested in the Sequoia before the redesign, and after seeing the new 2008's it moved to top of my list. We got the Limited edition and added the dual headrest DVDs with 2nd Row bucket seats. I could not be more happy with this car. It is primarily my wife's and she goes on and on about how much she loves driving this car. It has an incredible turning radius for a car of its size and drives very quiet and smooth. For long trips, the ride, the navigation, and the rear DVDs make traveling with our 3 year old and 3 month old a breeze. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I needed a full size SUV that had trailer towing capacity that gave me room to play when towing a boat. I have had Toyotas in the past and though always scant on creature comforts have been extremely well made and reliable. My last clocked in at 450,000 km and only died due to an accident. Issues IPOD connectivity useless to non existent. Don't bother with the Toyota cable. Navigation package useless. Very error laden, extremely user unfriendly, better to buy an aftermarket system. A 150$ garmin will outperform the Toyota navigation. Gas cap has no lock. Oil changes, uses a cartridge filter that few aftermarket dealers have. Dealers even hate doing changes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine power- power to spare hauling 6000 lbs. Comfort; great seats, views good comfortable ride, plenty of adjustability for trailer towing. Turning radius - beats any other vehicle in its size class. Quiet ride, low noise at highway speed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love this truck, bought it 500 miles ago. I had a Ford expedition that I got rid of when gas hit almost $5.00 a gallon. I went to a Cherokee sport which was just as bad, then I went to 2009 Toyota matrix, which was beautiful on gas, but I was very unhappy with the limited space. 10 months later I traded in the matrix for the sequoia (best investment I made!). I don't care if gas hits $10.00 a gallon - it's worth it & if you put super you can get about 14 miles a gallon in the city.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my wife's Ford Explorer Sport for the Sequoia Limited 4wd, and it was the best thing we ever did. Before purchasing the 2008 Sequoia, we test drove the Escalade, Tahoe, 2006 Sequoia and Expedition XL for a weekend each, and the 2008 Sequoia was the clear winner. The Sequoia ride quality and handling ability is excellent... even in 4 wheel drive. Our regular ski trips to Lake Tahoe have been a lot more comfortable and fun, since we got the Sequoia. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power from the 5.7L engine. The tight turning ability of the Sequoia. The third row seats is very comfortable for tall guys. Also, if you get the DVD player option, it's installed with a 115V AC outlet with video ports, so you can hookup a game station for the kids to use with the DVD screen. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the 2008 Platinum Sequoia for family and weekend road trips. I test drove the Escalade ESV, Suburban, and Expedition XL. I chose the Sequoia with very little deliberation. The ride is smooth and the options are top rate. I love the interior space, the only two complaints I have are the lack of chrome accents for a model labeled platinum and the navigation and radio system. The resolution on the nav system is poor and the text limitation on the radio is just ridiculous for a product from Toyota. I know the profit margins had to be huge, because they did not invest a lot of money to impress customers or be competitive with $150 Nav systems from Best Buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in Odyssey (loved it) to get a SUV that would fit our family of 6 and tow our 4,500lb boat. The Sequoia w\ 5.7L has plenty of power on tap & even more torque. It accelerates better w\ boat in tow than my 2002 Tundra V8 did w\ no boat. Ride is good for a SUV, but definitely not minivan smooth. Ergonomics are pretty good, but cups & controls hard to reach (even w\ my long arms). Like the high ride height & visibility. Middle & back rows easily fit 6'+ passengers w\ leg-room to spare. Avg 16-17mpg, which is good for large SUV in town w\ this much power.</TEXT>

I have a 2 year old and one on the way, 2 big dogs and a 6' + hubby, while I am only 5'3". I drive approx 1400 miles a week (yes, really). I LOVE my truck. I am so happy with it AND I am really tough to please. I cheaped out and got the base model and I'm thrilled. It's even won my Dad over. I have learned how to dock it in to parking spaces but it turns as good as our Mercedes. If you are thinking about it, do it, you won't regret it.

<TEXT>You may as well buy this one!!! Don't let some of the magazine reviews turn you away from buying this gorgeous vehicle. I mean, let's face it, is there a halfway decent car out there that has room for the whole family AND gets good gas mileage. The simple answer is NO. My 2008 Sequoia is a smooth smooth ride, and mine spends its time on Boston roads, which are some of the worst pothole infested roads in the country. Some reviews say that the steering is too easy, and coming from a 4runner I can see what they are saying, but if the Sequoia had a Lexus badge they would be complementing its effortless steering instead of trying do equate it to a Chevy Silverado.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I got the SR5 but I got it fully loaded. I love the driver's seat, especially the power ergonomic leg support. The telescopic steering is wonderful, and of course the 3rd row power seats. It's incredible how the rows fold flat to have a pickup truck on-demand. The 381hp 5.7L and 6spd auto are great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I chose the Sequoia because I did the research and read a lot of comments posted on this very website. I am very pleased with the Limited 4X2. The ride is what I expected, but even better. I love the turning radius, when once was disappointed with the Tundra radius. The Sequoia is very sleek in it's interior design. It is very spacious and love the tri-climate control. Gas mileage is about 16-18 hwy. The body is huge and the front end takes some getting use to when it comes to parking. I am very happy I went with an SUV, as a long time truck person, I am pleased. </TEXT>

<TEXT>2008 Sequoia Platinum, slate w/ red rock interior, laser cruise and DRL the only options. I've already filled it with stuff twice and am amazed at how much fits with rearview mirror still usable. Interior reconfiguration is so simple and easy. 400 lb-ft of torque is always evident and handling is surprisingly good in the sport mode. In soft mode, 85 on a smooth interstate feels like 70. The seating position and front visibility are great, but there are blind spots behind the large front pillars. You get the same huge center console as the Tundra, designed for people using their truck as an office. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This 5,700 monster has a turn radius like a Honda Civic. Driver has 4 cupholders in easy reach. The climate control is accurate and easy to use. Laser cruise control is totally predictable and so convenient. You must add this option if most of your driving is on the highways.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We drove our new Sequoia to Sequoia National Park for our first outing with the new vehicle. During this drive, we experienced driving in city, open freeway, mountain roads and icy roads. The entire drive was very smooth. The 6-speed automatic engine was far better than our previous 4-speed domestic luxury SUV. It handled very well in all conditions. The interior of the car has more "plastic" than I normally like. Needs a little more wood trim and some plastic mouldings are loose. Navigation system was excellent. The ride with the air suspension was very comfortable and the steering wheel was steady over all the bumps.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded our 2002 Suburban for the Sequoia in Jan., 2008. With three kids and three dogs, we loved the automatic third row and hatch. It drives and parks like a dream. Within 6 months, tho, the a/c smelled like mildew. After four LENGTHY visits to the dealership who found mildew on the filter, multiple calls to Toyota (we purchased the extended warranty), we are extremely dissatisfied with the "customer service." There is a constant clicking noise under the cage, the hatch does not close all the way, and the dealer could not solve any of the problems. The navigational system cuts off when driving so passengers cannot enter the info. Our TomTom is more well designed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the vehicle for over six months now, and it is flawlessly executed, and easy to drive smoothly, even if it never hides its size. But there is a glaring flaw that might get me to return it when the lease is over: Cargo space. You buy a big vehicle like this if you have a big family, so the third row is always in use. Cargo space is minuscule behind that row, barely a foot of floor, with the seatback angling back, taking away space as you move up. If the vehicle were 18 inches longer, all of it in the trunk, it would be perfect for its mission. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We had an 03' loved it. We drive this vehicle everywhere and love it. We bought the sr5 model and added leather, blue tooth, t.v. system. We have a rattle in the back unless one of the kids is sitting back in the second row of seats. So much improvement over the last truck. With 4 kids and a screaming stereo you cannot even tell that they are with you.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been a truck/suv guy all my life. When it became time to "put down" my Chevy Suburban I began diligent research to find it's replacement. Without question this is the best large SUV all around for the money. Go ahead and shop Chevy, Ford, Caddy, GMC, M.Benz and most importantly DRIVE THEM. Toyota has them all beat in quality and reliability and performance. While M.Benz has an edge on interior luxury, it lacks in ALL other categories when compared. Sequoia is unbeatable as a family vehicle, especially if you plan to take long trips or tow a boat or camper. What it lacks in the "bling" factor it more than makes up for in the "cha-ching" factor--financially it makes good sense.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Third row seats (big enough for adults) recline and fold flat with the touch of a button. Extremely roomy interior, easy access to third row, power rear hatch, tons of storage space, comfortable seating, a rear window that actually goes down, back up camera and adjustable shocks for "sport"/comfort"</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It is the first truck we own. Drive very comfortable and good mileage. We took 2 trips to the same road to test out the mileage. First trip fill up with Sheetz gas and got 17.8 mpg avg. Second trip fill up with Sunoco gas and got 18.4 mpg avg on the computer display. Wonder why so much different? It must be the quality in brand gas and no brand. Over all, it is very good truck and highly recommend to new buyer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>With a need to haul people and tow a boat, big SUVs are my family's only option. I have spent a lot of time in all the competing big SUVs. With the changes brought to the Sequoia in 2008, I now feel it is the best vehicle in its class. Love the fold flat third row, and the ride and handling are as close to 'sportscar' as you can get in a big vehicle like this. The 'wish list' includes some gps/computer oddities but the engine/ride/handling/utility are unrivaled. The bluetooth/audio/temp controls on the steering wheel are excellent and totally negate the need to reach for the main controls strewn across the dash. Some gps/phone features are unavailable while driving in the name of safety</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the most important categories are strengths for this SUV: Utility, ride, handling, towing, engine. Second to none. The tight turning circle makes this big SUV easy to park. The fold flat third row is a must for anyone who actually plans to put people back there. Excellent driving experience.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We all know how the Sequoia drives under normal conditions, but hook up a travel trailer and enjoy it even more. Our fully loaded Limited includes the air bag suspension which keeps the vehicle level without having to transfer additional weight to the front end. After a weekend outing to the Oregon Coast I was very impressed with the power this rig has. The combo with our 29' Tango was no match for climbing or descending the Oregon Coast Range. The transmission shifted with ease while in the tow mode and is simply a workhorse. The Sequoia handled better than any other truck / trailer combo I have driven over the last 15 years. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We just purchased our Sequoia two weeks ago and love it. We shopped around and took a look at the Tahoe and Escalade to compare it to. The Escalade was about $25k more and a lot worse on the mpg. Workmanship of the Tahoe had a poor feel and look to it, not to mention poor resale value. We had a 2004 Toyota 4 Runner and loved it, but were running out of space and decided to move up to the big boy. We can actually fit 3 more adults into the Sequoia over the 4 Runner comfortably. We opted for the SR5 4 X 4 with most of the options that come on the Limited edition, but without the additional $$$. We actually paid a little less for the Sequoia then we did for the 4 Runner almost 5 years ago.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The leather seats are plush and rear view camera is great. The second and third row seats have plenty of space for adults. The ride and gear shift with the 5.7 liter engine and six speed transmission is smooth. It's not a boat on the road and the steering, handling, and braking are very responsive. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We recently let go of our 04 Suburban. Our concern was the loss of room. We knew from experience, our 04 simply did not have the craftsmanship to rival our new Sequoia's life expectancy. The features are well thought out and intuitive. The conveniences have become necessities so don't skimp on these if you appreciate luxury. We needed all the features plus the room so save the addt'l 10k stick w/ the limited. Very smooth ride, not sure if the 20" tires make a difference from standard 17", our Sequoia is fully loaded with all the accessories except two-driver seat memory and 4WD.

<TEXT>We've had our Sequoia since July 08, approximately 5 months. We are a family of 4. My husband, myself, and our two children both under 4years. We purchased the limited, black exterior with tan interior. Our sequoia has everything except for nav and dvd. Things we love: interior roominess- we can fit two carseats, and a full sized adult in the second and third rows. This never happened in our old suv. All three rows recline. In the second row, each seat moves individually. So if the middle person wants to recline, they can do so without bothering the other two riders. My husband now wants to trade his corolla S for a similar riding Tundra!</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I first looked at the new Sequoias I thought that they would drive like a monster, however, when I test drove it, it was so smooth and the transmission shifted without me even noticing it. You could tell that this vehicle was well engineered and geared towards people who want a large SUV but without the "truck like" feel to it. The Sequoia is driven primarily by my wife but I always find excuses to drive it on the weekends and we do all of our trips in it. Its a great vehicle and I strongly recommend it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Sequoia just over a month ago due to finding out that I will be having another child. I absolutely love driving it, to bad it is primarily my wife's vehicle. I recently had to make a trip to NC from NY and decided to take the Sequoia to see how it did on a long drive. The MPG was great for it size, it averaged 19-20 on the highway. The ride was extremely smooth and I did not have to crank up the radio to hear it over the road noise. I only gave a 8 for comfort due to the fact that my wife, who is 5'2", has a hard time reaching the pedals and being relaxed at the same time. There is also an annoying little squeaking noise coming from the back seat somewhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Wonderful car. We might end up with two in the garage. Big and spacious for my four kids. My wife said the other day she is afraid to step on full throttle because it seems it might go on its rear wheels; it's fast. It's quiet, visibility is great, and very comfortable to drive, even long distances. I've never driven all the way from Phoenix to L.A. without my wife helping part of the way, but last June, I did, both to and from. Haven't had any problems so far, however, I have a small rattle on the moon-roof which disappears when I go to the dealership. Don't keep your eyes on the gas-gauge though, you might be disappointed, but I expected it when I bought the car. All in all, I love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've been needing a family car for awhile now - with 2 kids and 2 dogs. Finally bought this tank. Man, we've been loving it. Comfy, tons of room, very quiet, drives great, and the turning radius is excellent for a car this size. Lots of storage, even when the 3rd row seat is up. I really like the 6 speed Steptronic shifting -- takes a little getting used to, but once you do, it's fun AND it's more fuel efficient and the full automatic mode (keep the RPM low). Overall MPG after about 300 miles = 15.5. I would imagine that once the engine is broken into more and my wife gets used to the Steptronic, getting 16+ mpg wouldn't be out of reach.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got this for the family and work. Got it with all the bells and whistles. Love the Red Rock leather. Comfortable ride. Not bad gas usage for a V8. Very comfortable ride with a vehicle height adjustment for when stopped and loading/unloading. Acceleration a little slow but manual option allows for better acceleration control. Looked at Escalade, Yukon, Mercedes Benz and decided this was best bang for the buck. Also, handling/steering seems better and quality is good. Interior better looking than the GM cars. Also, back seats automatic and fold flat, unlike the GM cars. Storage minimal when using all 7/8 passengers but most SUV's like that. Perfect for 4 person family. </TEXT>

The power, the comfort, the features, the Toyota reliability, and then the price. It has the only excellent editor rating which I was skeptical but hands down, definitely the best buy if you're in a market for this type of SUV. Do your research, test drive them all, check the price, and the reliability. Why pay twice as much for a Land Cruiser or a Lexus LX? BTW, this Sequoia is made in the USA.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The power option for folding the third row seats is GREAT! Now, if Toyota can just apply that same option to the second row seats, it would be outstanding.

<TEXT>Owned a '97 4 runner and was extremely pleased, but needed something bigger to carry family to and from AAU Girls National basketball tournaments. Looked at all the competition and frankly they were no match for the Sequoia, in my opinion. The interior design and comfort is far superior to all the others especially in the rear seating area. The buckets in the second row are fully adjustable and also recline which made it great for the rear passengers. Not difficult to handle around town and it's performance is well, outstanding. Recent long trip,passengers were very comfortable. Gas mileage low, but not why most will buy this vehicle. The Platinum has all the goodies,add entertainment system</TEXT>

With three growing children and a lot of long trips planned we wanted something bigger than the Sienna for these trips.

When you compare each of those cars to the Toyota, probably each will have a thing or two better than the Toyota BUT as a package... nothing is comparable. The ride is very close to the Navigator, the performance... well there is nothing to compare too! The interior is extremely roomy and especially the 2nd and 3rd row (both fold flat and recline). Compared to the previous model, it is amazing what Toyota was able to achieve. The interior could be slightly richer. I am getting around 15.5 MPG for mostly city driving. Try it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle has POWER & is extremely roomy. Have no worries about how much time it'll spend in the shop b/c this is our 2nd Sequoia & we are more than pleased.

However, we preferred the bumper railing on our '05. Thought it looked sporter, otherwise the front grill, step boards, and racks on top help the body's overall look. The chrome accents are a MUST!

<TEXT>Just got the Sequoia last weekend and I'm wondering why it took us so long to find the perfect family SUV. We had an 03 Expedition that was acting up. Figure we'd give Toyota a try since big Ford has let us down on what was suppose to be our 10 year SUV. For being a full size SUV, this machine drives like a car. Suspension is much nicer and acceleration is super smooth. I never thought I'd ever switch to a Japanese SUV for fear that it's not roomy enough for my family but I'm sure glad now. Definitely made the right decision. The design is well thought out for families that need to drive 3 kids in car seats. Love the fact that the 2nd row slides forward for easier access to 3rd row.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We needed an SUV for our 3 greyhounds and something to tow our 7500 lb travel trailer - a minivan or a "crossover" were out of the question, so after considering loads of other candidates (Suburban, Durango, Expedition EL) it came down to the Sequoia. With the high gas prices, you can really swing a sweet deal on an SUV, even one of these. Sure a minivan beats it in outright interior space and gets better MPG, but there's no substitute for true V8 power, torque and brawn when you really need it. Very smooth and quiet with more than enough power to handle just about any situation. Right now these seem pretty exclusive - you won't see yourself coming and going like you would in a Suburban.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 5.7 iForce V8 is a true gem. Toyota really outdid themselves on this one and it totally smokes the competition. Test reports say it'll do 0-60 in the 6s and 1/4 in the high 14s - not too shabby for a 3-ton SUV, and I believe it. This thing flat out hauls. MPG isn't bad, all things considered.</FAVORITE>

I used to be a GM truck guy, but had so many reliability and customer service problems that I finally conducted a fair assessment of the large SUVs available and the Sequoia came out on top. It handles great (not like the 5,900 pound SUV that it is), looks great, and the time is right to buy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 5.7L V8 is well designed with lots of power on tap. The overall interior are spacious. The back up camera keeps you in check.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Now that I have had my Sequoia for a few months, I can honestly say for such a big vehicle it handles very smoothly. The engine is quiet, the power is unbelievable. I have a big family and needed a vehicle with room and the Sequoia has plenty and more to spare. Don't expect great gas mileage with this vehicle. Especially around town. But I wouldn't have bought it if I did. I only get about 9-10 MPG. I have never been in such a big vehicle that makes u-turns better then most cars I have owned. Back hatch-door is heavy enough to shut on it's own without power option. We are a toyota family and after owning this beast of a machine I don't plan on changing. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Entertainment system for kids, design of interior, 6 disc JBL systems, massive arm rest/console area for storage, smoothness and comfort of ride, middle row slides forward for leg room in third row </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased our Sequoia in March, a few days later we were on our way to Pismo Beach. I really enjoyed the smooth ride and the level of comfort on our trip up North. My kids got to enjoy the DVD system and my wife and I enjoyed our Siruis sat. radio. We were going to buy an Armada but when we saw the Sequoia it just captured our heart and our wallet. Sorry Nissan!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I enjoy all the storage space this SUV has to offer. I was really suprised with the Jbl sound system but my kids enjoy having the extra power outlet in the back. I love that the back window comes down. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2005 Honda Odyssey for the Sequoia as my wife tired of driving a minivan. I researched this purchase for almost six months and determined that the Sequoia was the best vehicle, for our needs, on the market. After purchasing, I couldn't have been more right. What we lost in fuel efficiency we certainly gained in vehicle enjoyment. Our fully loaded Limited has a fantastic ride and plenty of bells and whistles. The backup camera, sound system (although would like to have a 6 disc changer vs. the available 4 disc option), moonroof and Bluetooth are awesome. The second and third rows have a tremendous amount of room for our four kids.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the body style, ride, Bluetooth, moonroof, power side mirrors, electric fold-down 3rd row seats, rear power hatch, 2nd and 3rd row space. For a large vehicle, this thing handles remarkably well. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Pound for pound, dollar for dollar there is no better SUV on the market. I consider myself a tough customer and after test driving the Navigator and Escalade, I knew the new Seqouia was best SUV in less than ten seconds. It drives like a dream.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I thought I would never say this but the back up camera is awsome. With an SUV this size, it makes parking so much easier and a bumper the wont get damaged. The DVD entertainment with the wireless headsets are awesome as well. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you want a Sequoia, it is here. This has all the bells and whistles you could want. Road trips are just easier these days. Enjoy the Lazer cruise control, the XM radio, cooling seats (more like a breeze). Just a better product than my '06. Love the red-stone interior. Although the second row captain chairs are so-so, I would have preferred the bench style which is not available in the Platinum model.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I turned in my BMW X5 SAV and needed a vehicle with a 3rd row of seats that would accommodate someone older than 10. I searched for about two months and finally decided on the 2008 Sequoia Limited. I don't love the changed front end (too Tundra-ish), but I love the interior - from the 2nd row Captain's chairs to the power 3rd row roomy bench seat. I upgraded a few things (especially love the woodgrain dash upgrade - makes it infinitely classier looking) and am very pleased that I purchased this vehicle. I truly enjoy it a lot more than I thought I would. I love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>2nd row Captain's chairs (w/no center console!), upgraded woodgrain dash, power 3rd row seat, power liftgate, TONS of room, storage, rear design (w/o spoiler), DVD system, standard sun-shades for 2nd & 3rd rows, ride comfort, sonar parking assist, ease of drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We chose the 2008 Sequoia because of the fold-flat 3rd row seating and the reliability of Toyota. The 4WD and sport-shift were invaluable on our recent trip to CO, especially during the snow storm at Wolf Creek Pass and on the many unimproved back roads. The 5.7L V8 is remarkably powerful and smooth. The headrest DVD system is great. Very roomy and very comfortable and very quiet, small turning radius, feels safe and solid. We average 16.6 mpg daily driving. I now look forward to driving each day. I'm surprised there isn't more buzz about this car - it is fabulous!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>5.7L V8 engine, 3 zone climate control (finally an end to the temperature wars), massive center console (ladies, this is the perfect place for your handbag - it's easily accessible and won't dump out on the floor).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2006 Sequoia for the 2008 Platinum additon. The ride is so much better than the older version and their interior refinements have entered the modern market with competitiors like Lexus, BMW, Lincoln. It gets much better mileage than the old one and all around a much more civilized vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very pleased with the first month of ownership of the new Sequoia. Traded 2nd of two Navigators owned for improved reliability and equal towing capacity. Early highway mileage is 22mph @ 65 mph; overall highway and around town averaging 17mpg on regular gas. Cargo area same size as Navigator. I purchased the Limited edition and added running lights, power rear door,backup camera. The Platinum edition requires 20 in. low profile tires which ride harder and are more difficult to balance. Nav system was too far away to safely use while driving and I have my own Nuvi I like better. With the Limited you lose memory seats. Toyota needs to unbundle 18 inch wheels, memory seats, nav, offer options.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted a large SUV I could pack full of stuff including the kids for long trips. About a year ago when I heard the Sequoia was going to be redesigned for this year I held off my purchase and decided to see what the ?08 had to offer. I?m glad I did because I absolutely love it. In fact the whole family does. I?ve already taken it on a 1200 mile road trip and it was a joy to drive (as much as a 19 hour dive can be with two kids). We were able to load up the back with the 3rd row down and there was still room for the kids to sit in the second row. There was even enough room between the car seats for my wife to sit between them when needed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powerful engine, smooth ride (18? rims ride nicer than the better looking 20?ers), backup camera, interior space, comfortable seating in every one of the 8 seats, DVD.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Drives like a dream come true. I am very surprised at the drive ablity / size. Make no mistake this a big, smooth and powerful SUV. It is smooth in parking lots as well on the interstates. Its power & braking are great. It is quiet. The sound system, backup camera, & GPS are great. The reason the driver has a hard time reaching the dash is because the cab is so roomy. This is a great ride if you want luxury w/ plenty of pulling power. For almost 6,000 lbs. & the power it has, it gets great gas mileage. Thanks Toyota you did a great job.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned over 7 SUVs since 1998 and have found that this Toyota Sequoia is the best driving one of all. The turning radius is the smallest of all. The safety features and navigation system only add to the value one gets with this vehicle. The technology is mind boggling. The blue tooth cell phone aspect allows the driver to answer thier phone on the steering wheel with out ever having to reach for the cell phone. Caller ID shows up on the nav system screen. The rear camera allows the driver to see whats there and the sensors keep you from running into things. I strongly recomend this vehicle to people who are concerned with safety and reliability.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned the vehicle for one month. Have driven across country and found the vehicle to be great on the road. Actually encountered blizzard conditions one day in Canada and the vehicle was terrific in the difficult driving conditions. So far I am very satisfied with the SUV. The only issue that I have is I could not order exactly the vehicle that I wanted. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2001 Limited for the 2008 Limited. After months of agony deciding if I should switch from a Toyota to a Lincoln Navigator I ended up sticking with the same car again. Same color and all. My neighbors were rather confused. I'd purchased the 2001 when they first came out and after 7 years had absolutely no major problems with the car so I decided to stick with the new 2008 model. I've had it a few days and love it. Although I must admit it feels fairly larger to drive, kinda like you're in tank or a cockpit, but you get used to it quickly. Price is much higher than before but guess you gotta pay for more automation, i.e., nav, theatre system, power hatch and seats. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features would be the automation. The 2001 didn't have the power hatch or power folding seats (it's a must with kids). I also like the captains chairs with the walk through to the third row. The look of the dash and steering wheel w/Bluetooth is great also.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Seeing that this is my first SUV purchase it was well worth it! I test drove the Tahoe. I wasnt feeling it at all. The Expedition just didnt look appealing to me either. Once I saw the Sequioa. I fell in love with it. Once I drove it I knew this was the truck for me. My wife who drives a Honda Accord even likes the way it handles. Im 6`4 so its just fine with me!!! Thank you Toyota for getting it right!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have been driving Toyotas since 1990. They are the most dependable vehicles in this planet! We still drive our 1998 4 runner and have never had any problems! We traded in our 2006 Tacoma for the 2008 Sequoia because it rides like a luxury car. We feel safe in it will all the airbags! This is the way to go!

<TEXT>Love it! Wow, my wife and I purchased this after our 04 Armada, which had its share of problems but was overall a real nice vehicle for us for the last several years. The new Sequoia seems larger inside, yet fits inside the garage just a bit better, maybe because of rounded corners. The outside style takes some getting used to regarding the hood and front bumper. Without the front sensors, I wouldn't have a clue where the corners are. Between the beeping sensors and great quality rear backup camera, I haven't hit anything yet.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, smoothness of ride, quality materials although not very "fancy". Will probably be a lot of wood kits sold. Sensors, camera, gadgets, navigation, power folding mirrors, & toys.</FAVORITE>
