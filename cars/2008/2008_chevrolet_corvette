<TEXT>I now have this car almost 2 years with only 1 minor issue. The trunk release from outside the car(by the rear plate)don't work. Besides that no other issues. This car is awesome, with incredible power. It's also very comfortable even on long trips. I'm always looking for an excuse to drive because of the fun of this machine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have an 08 convertible with the 3LT option and my wife has the 08 coupe with the Z51 option and the dual mode exhaust. I did not get the exhaust option on mine or the Z51 option and quickly wanted to drive her car instead. Now I've added a GM performance exhaust system to mine and wooooo!!!! However, I am now already looking at jumping on an 09 model as they now offer the cyber grey color. I hope to get a dealer to put me into that car, otherwise my wife and I can still enjoy our two 08 models. Now I will shop for an 09 with the dual mode exhaust and Z51 options exclusively. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>both are fun to drive for their own reasons. Get one of both!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Vette since my 1969 convertible. The performance is exceptional. The aerodynamics are well engineered, the car actually feels like it's attached to the road - extremely solid and smooth on the highway. Low end torque is so powerful that you never have to rev the engine past 2200 RPM if you don't want to. The shift linkage is very smooth and short coupled. Steering wheel controls are unnecessary because the stereo and HVAC dash controls are perfectly position right above your hand when on the shifter. The panel is a throw back to the 63-67 series, my favorite. I'm 62 and I absolutely love every minute I spend in this car, it's a delight to own and drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Targa top - simple to remove. Takes me less than 30 seconds to remove and store in the trunk. DIS - much more logical and easier to use than my 08 Caddy. Hatch Back Storage - unlike previous Vetts lots of space, even with the Targa top in place.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I owned a '69 427 pumped up Vette for 16 years. Decided at last, to replace it instead with a new one a few weeks ago. My old car was a beast, and this one equals it, but stock and under warranty! Chevy has finally brought back a true muscle car! Fun to drive, great gas mileage, unbelievably 26.5 mpg after a 3200 mile trip out west, and a rather comfortable ride to boot. I still miss my old car but this one takes away the pain leaving nothing to be desired. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Got this as a Christmas gift Dec. 07. We are a Corvette family, with my mom owning a 82' and also a 2005. After driving both of those I was ecstatic to get in my 08 for the first drive. This thing handles like nobody's business, so smooth and responsive. I love all the little gadget-y stuff (like the OnStar, GPS, heated seats are fab. in the cold NY winters). The push button start took some getting used to, I prefer to turn a key myself. Also, getting in and out was a comedy of errors until I figured out how it's supposed to be done. My only real complaint was an extremely squeaky roof. Every time I hit a bump, squeak, squeak. Dealer fixed it no problem. This car is amazingly sharp!</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>08 Z-51 Coupe</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>AI bought an 08 with 5000 miles on it. It has Z-51, dual mode and 6 speed manual. Performance is outstanding, dual mode is fun. Z-51 suspension is on the stiff side. It is OK in states with smooth roads, but would be bothersome in northern climates with cracked pavement. Overall a well built car so far.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dual mode exhaust is cool. I have dual tops and like the ability to change when I want to. The Bose stereo is decent for a Vette and the 6 speed has nice short throws. I like the XM radio a lot.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had never owned a Corvette before purchasing a new 2008 crystal red metalic coupe. I thought that I could not afford one yet, and then the Chevrolete employee pricing was offered. I had planned to wait another 5 years before taking the plung, but the price was right sooner. I had never even been in a Vette or even test driven a Vette until my purchase. I just knew I wanted one! I couldn't be any more pleased with color, speed and acceleration, interior. I love everything about this car. Everyone else loves it too. To all you who have put off purchasing the new C6 Corvette...go do it, you'll not regret it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My Corvette knows me. My Proximity key unlocks the vehicle as you walk up to it and locks when you walk away. OnStar is great. Push button start. Very easy to wash exterior surfaces. Neighbors come out of the wood work and are more personable people too due to their interest in the car.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Dissapointed</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Considering all the good reviews I must have gotten the car built on a Friday before a holiday. This is the worst car I have ever owned. Worst paint job I have ever seen. Silver body doesn?t match the gray front. Visible drips in the paint. Car was purchased new but I took it to a body shop to see if it was ever hit and repainted. Seams don't line up, door doesn't close flush. Worst stereo I have ever heard. Cheap interior. Center console was put on incorrectly. Window indexing mechanism was defective. Brakes continued to squeak even after service addressed issue. Loud and embarrassing buzzing/humming sound coming from the dash when car goes over 70mph. Too many other problems to list.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior of this car is a work of art (from a distance). Great gas mileage. OnStar is a nice feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm a mechanical engineer and I love this car, my first Corvette! Acceleration, fuel economy, fun to drive. It's much more than I thought a Corvette could be. The engineers who worked on this car should be very proud. I test drove what I thought was my dream car, a BMW Z coupe, M series (my daily driver is a 5 series) and it did not compare. Only two options; Z51 and dual mode exhaust. I removed the fuse from the exhaust so it's open all the time. At 58 years old, this car makes me feel the same way I did when I was 23. I drive it on day long trips through the Ozark mountains, simply wonderful. A pure expression of freedom and individuality. It's magic!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration, it's breathtaking. Firing it up early on a Saturday morning. This car has long legs. I've spent twelve hours driving it, stopping only for gas and coffee, very comfortable. And I've averaged 22 miles per gallon overall since I bought it 7600 miles ago.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 11th Corvette since I was 18. I have had a pretty wide spread of years and this 2008 steals the show! Very docile in traffic but packs a heck of a punch when desired. I had a fast 1972 LT1 car that this one would probably beat, and be more comfortable doing it. The electronic suspension control really steps up to the plate when needed. Thanks Chevy, you're number 1 in my book!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I finally pulled the trigger when Chevy had the employee pricing. I couldn't be happier with the car. The acceleration is breathtaking. The lines of the car are sharp and a real eye catcher. My only complaint on this beast is the stereo sound system. For $70K put a good sound system in. I purchased the atomic orange Z06 and it accelerates like an atomic bomb and the roar of the exhaust is better than the stereo anyways. I have owned a 1990 Vette and the technology now is just unbelievable especially the Z06. Am I happy with the car, heck yes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car strictly for the performance. It is not a daily driver for me. This is my first Vette. I test drove TT,335I, IS350, G35. The power of this car with NPP,Z51 and 6 speed manual is a rush. Nothing compares in this price range. I do think the seats could be more comfortable and I will replace the run flats with Pilot Sports when worn out. The targa top "pops" over large bumps. I've been told that is a common issue but easy to fix. When driving aggressively I sometimes have troulbe finding 3rd gear. Bought the Mild to Wild dual mode exhaust controller and run it open all the time. The sound is awesome. Overall very happy with it and can't wait to get back in it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6 speed, NPP exhaust and Z51. New rims for 08. Push button start. Being able to select competitive mode or turn off traction control. It does make a difference in acceleration. Be careful though!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It is a privilage and pleasure to own and drive a 2008 "Crystal Red" 427 special edition Z06 Corvette. I thought seriously about buying a Nissan GTR, but after seeing the GTR in person, I felt it remined me of a fancy Nissan Altima with new fenders. The engine sounded tame and boring. It just didnt excite me much. In contrast, just standing near the Z06 Corvete and looking at it, makes your heart race. I fell in love with this sexy beast from the moment it rumbled to life with a push of the button. The car looks twice in good in person as it does in pictures and sounds beautiful. It's incredibly fun to drive, and I have to beat the girls away from it. I absolutly love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Beautiful color, full leather interior. Comfort of the seats, the HUD display. Seat and mirror memory setting for me and my wife. The roar of the engine especially with the fuse pulled and all exaust ports open. It sounds like the opening to Van Halens "Hot for Teacher" drum roll. Rockin!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've been looking to buy a new Corvette for about 3 months. With GM reporting a sales decrease of 45% for October, I knew now was the time to pull the trigger. I bought the machine silver 2008 convertible with titanium interior and a black top. It looks great in the garage and I smile everytime I open the garage door. Absolutely no buyer's remorse. The only reason I gave the interior design a 9 is because I can't plug my MP3 into the stereo... what's that all about? The NPP dual mode exhaust is cool as hell and the magnetic selective ride rocks. If you're thinking at all about buying one of these, don't wait any longer. Now's the time do get a great deal on a great American sports car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's a convertible. The top goes down and with the heated seats life couldn't be better. The dual mode exhaust sounds sweet when you start it up. The waves, honks, and thumbs up I get when I'm driving around town. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased a 2005 auto Vette 11/05 and had nothing but trouble with it, mostly electronics. I took a chance and purchased a 2008 12/15/07 with six speed and very little in options. What a car. The ride is better, my wife hated the ride in the 2005, and it is a joy to drive. The color is Crystal Red and is an attraction where ever we ago. Gas mileage is around 25 mpg. The six speed has enhanced the overall enjoyment even when in traffic, which is common in the DFW area freeways. My next Vette will be the ZR1- I hope.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got this car in place of a Porsche 911 S and believe me, this car is no Porsche. It's huge for a "sports car". A sports car is supposed to be small, powerful and nimble. The Vette's handling is comparable to an elephant trying to perform on the balance beam at the Olympics. Sure, I like the power under the hood. 30 horses with the dual mode exhaust sounds great, but that's about the only thing that's great on this car. After driving BMW's, Z cars, Porsche's and even my Mercedes E350, I am very disappointed in the way this car's handing and appointments are for the money. Can't anyone in the U.S. build a "sports car" at least in the league of the afore mentioned. Pitiful. </TEXT>

<TEXT>427 cubes of modern day small block, push rod V8 engine technology is a wonderful thing! I never thought it would happen in an age of hybrids and ever greener emission standards. The Chevrolet Corvette Z06 is the best of all worlds. Big time muscle car performance, yet still docile and comfortable enough for every day commuting. It don't get much better than this! Corvette still rules as America's #1 favorite sports car. Thank you Chevrolet!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 505hp LS7 is a modern marvel of old fashion, but highly modernized push rod V8 engine techology, with 3" exhausts, is music to my ears. C6 coupe "fixed" roof with fastback sloping rear window is a huge styling improvement over the of the last Z06. Most street legal bang for the buck available bar none! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 4th new Corvette, my first Z06, and by far my most powerful and fun Vette ever. This car looks incredible and has the performance to match the looks. Complete strangers tell me they love it, and even my wife saw it and said it was the best looking Vette she had ever seen. I bought it 48 hours later. It graces my garage parked next to my 02 vette (7,200 miles) which I am saving for my only daughter who was born in 2002. The license plates have her name and 02. At 5 years old she is already a Vette fanatic, she has good taste like her dad and mom.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sound of that motor is music to my ears, so much so that I do not even listen to the radio at all. It screams power from start to shut down,and oh what a feeling. The car just exceeds my every expectation and was money well spent no matter what fuel cost.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned five Corvettes in my life, but my 2008 is the first new one I have had. In 2004 I bought a beautiful black 2002 convertible and I really loved it, then I began reading about the 2008 and the new engine, and I figured since I had just turned 60 I would by a new Corvette. I ordered a Crystal red convertible, ebony interior, dual mode exhaust and LT3 package. I have not been disappointed, it handles like a dream, it feels so tight and manageable and when you just step on the gas, not floor it, you are doing 70 before you know it, but the best part is that almost every time I take it out, strangers will stop and tell me that is the "best looking car I've ever seen". No problems.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm not one for american cars. Honda and Toyota are the quality I expect. So spending 45K on this car was a huge gamble for me. If Toyota or Honda made a real supercar then there would be no Vette in my garage. But I have to say, without a doubt this is one of the best cars in America today. Built with quality and not one problem so far. Very happy with the performance, 26+MPG on the highway and the fit and finish that will match anything from Japan. The 08 is much more than the 07 model. Hold out for a 08, you will be glad you did. Excellent ride and performance for the money. Much nicer dash layout than any other year Vette. I'm just so happy the fit and finish is as nice as it is. Also, Chevy is finally after all these years making the dash layout worth looking at. Seeing the same dash components in the Vette as the Chevette is one reason I waited so long to get one. Much better dash/interior than the previous years. Go and get one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6 speed manual is fun. Dual mode exhaust is a must have. Z51 is a must have. Are the rest of the bells and whistles worth the cost? Not to me. I stayed with the L1 package. Best bang for the buck.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my first Vette ever(Red 2008 Z06). I traded a 07 BMW 335i (I miss it by the way). The Z06 feels very fast and safe. Ggreat handling, great brakes, fat tires, low to the ground, super wide, etc. The looks of this car is just unbelievable. The regular Vette looks so plain and simple compared to the fat fender z06. This car is a real challenge for Ferrari, Porsches, Lamborghinis, you name it. This car screams on the highway, the sound of the engine is spectacular. It makes you want to go to the garage and just start up the car so that you can hear the engine. This car is a perfect sport coupe with a huge trunk (best on its class) </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Appeal (very wide, very low, flared fenders). Huge brakes, wide tires. The gearing makes this car reasonable in highway gas mileage, it is very good for a 505hp car. This car is a compliment magnet, it is attractive to all ages, genders, races, you name it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 5th Vette. The 08 LS3 is so smooth. The interior upgrades were overdue and really enhance the overall quality of the car. The 6 speed auto works well for high traffic cities while the paddles allow for manual pleasures when desired. When comparing my Vette to my brother's Cobra Mustang, I really appreciate the refined cockpit and nicely placed shifter, interior controls, and the overall feel and control of a 400+hp monster. If you can afford one you would be crazy not to buy one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been having constant problems with my new Z06.1. The automatic shift from 1st to 4th light does not comes on and off whether I am actually shifting from 1st to 4th. Sometimes the vehicle will not let me fill a full tank instead it only allows me to fill 1/2 a tank. My traction light comes on and off whenever it wants and it seems the rear end is slipping. When I make wide slow turns the steering wheel gets rock hard and I have to really hold it tight as if I didnt have power steering. When I pull my vehicle up to my drive way I hear the roof of the car crackling as if the roof is shifting. My power seat control went out the first week of owership and they had to replace it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Originally, I was going to get the wife a new Cadillac, and make my first Vette a used one. We both decided we weren't ready for the a Caddy, so we got a new Vette. The only comment I can make that says it all is that it is everything I dreamed it would be and more. We got the Z51 package, which is a little bit stiffer suspension. I was worried it might be a little rough riding, but it isn't. It's smooth as glass. I reccomend the Z51. The one option I didn't get and wish I had is the dual mode exhaust. Even without it, it still has a pretty good sound to it. If you take it easy on the highway, you can get pretty close to 30mpg, which is amazing for 430 HP. It's a rocket on wheels.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seats wrap around you for a really good feel. The Z51 package is awesome. The transmisson in the rear really equalizes the weight. Engine compartment is almost totally sealed which makes it easy to keep the engine clean. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been a Ford man for many years and never liked Corvettes.This is an unbelievable car in performance, handling, braking and fuel economy. In highway driving I can easily get 26 or 27 MPG, this is incredible for a 500 HP car. The seats are very comfortable as is the driving position. The car is hard to get in and out because it is very low to the ground. The suspension is very stiff which does not bother me but could be to much for some owners. This car is scary fast !</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been a fan of the Corvette as long as I remember, but this is my first one. Comparing it to anything else I've ever driven... well, I just can't. It outperforms them all in just about every way. Obviously, it is a sportscar and no one can deny it's performance (even not considering it's price). I shopped several european vehicles and looked at a couple of Asian models. The only thing close of US manufacturer's are the Viper (not civil enough for me) and the Cadillac, which is a heavier underpowered Corvette. Nothing compared. Acceleration is incredible, handling sublime, but what I'm most impressed with is the comfort. I'm 6'3" and feel comfortable enough to enjoy a 10 hr trip</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>NPP exhaust, 436 HP, HUD, 6 sp manual (must have for me in a sportscar), surprising comfort of ride (Magnetic Select Ride included), wow factor from myself and everyone else who sees it. Fuel economy is great for the type of car (averaging 25 mpg).</FAVORITE>

I have never driven a better, more enjoyable car in my life! It's an everyday driver, and I can't wait to start the motor each day. If you can afford it, don't miss the chance to own and drive one.

<TEXT>This is my second Corvette. After owning a 1986 Vette that I sold due to 2 teenage boys I just had to have another once they moved out. This Vette will keep a smile on your face. Very fun car to own and drive! Zero problems in the first 6 months and 2k miles of ownership. Paddle-shifting at full throttle with the optional dual-mode exhaust is a blast! Great handling and smooth ride - hard to believe you could have both! I expect we'll keep this Vette for quite some time and then pass it down to the kids.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great looks and power! Pulls hard even at 110mph! The Vette gets second looks even when dirty! Great trunk space for a convertible. Navigation direction arrows in heads-up display is nice. After-market options are abundent.</FAVORITE>

The dual mode exhaust is so cool, sounds like afterburners on a jet and the power is like riding in a rocket. HUD display is unique and a must have. Paddle shift and magnetic select ride features allow the driver to have two cars in one. Interior is luxurious enough for the real sports car enthusiast.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I ordered the 4LT package I was a bit skeptical, but after seeing the Linen first hand and feeling the difference in comfort and support alone compared to the 3LT or below I'd definitely say it was worth it. The only compliant is actually not even the cars fault, and that is the tire roar at highway speeds with the run flats. I've driven the last 3 generations of Vettes and this is by far the most advanced.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Head up display, linen interior, dual mode exhaust, the shifter is 10 times better than '07 I drove, and the amount of ease to bump up the horsepower to 500+ while retaining around 30 mpg on the highway! GM has come a full 180 since 2000 even, major kudos. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First time owner '08 3LT, Z51, dual mode exhaust, with Nav, etc., crystal red. I liked the C5 styling, but the C6 is so much better without popup headlights. Performance at this price point is amazing. The ride with the optional Z51 suspension is still very smooth, yet taut. Dual mode exhaust sounds simply awesome when you punch it in the guts, and adds a bit more power to boot. And who knew that a car capable of nearly 190 mph could get 25-30 mpg when driven normally. Amazing. And the trick integration of the HUD with the nav unit is super cool. I have very few negative things to say about this car. It's a keeper.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>HUD + navigation integration. Having driving directions pop up on my windshield is the ultimate gearhead geek. Crystal red is sexy in the sunlight. Keyless system is nice, still getting used to it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having have many performance German vehicles in the past (BMW E46 M3 was my last), there is no substitute for displacement. The torque on takeoff always puts a smile on my face. I love the NPP exhaust which I recommend to anyone as a must have. This car is a tremendous deal for the price that will spank many cars costing 2-3 times more. Also, to increase the HP to over 500 is relatively cheap compared to German or Italian cars.</TEXT>

Driving the vehicle is totally off the chain, I want to drive it all the time. The only improvement that I would recommend is the console between the seats. This area can be improved, my wife has some great ideas on this.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 5th Corvette and by far and away the best. The Magnetic Selected Ride Control system is great. In the sport mode it feels like a Z51 but without the rough ride. In the tour mode it rides like a Caddy. It's like getting two Vettes for the price of one. The optional factory installed performance exhaust is a must have feature along with the performance axle. Feeling and hearing the roar from the dual exhaust at start-up is as they say worth the price of admission. The spectacular LS3 engine feels like it should be rated at 476 hp rather than the listed 436 hp. I'am so glad I made the upgrade from a 05 C6. The 08 Corvette with it's 22 improvements is an awesome sports car! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Corvette 1993-C4, 1998-C5, and now 2008-C6-LT3. I got another all Black version with the LT3 package, 6sp manual, Navigation system, Z-51 handling package with dual exhaust system. I must be a masochist for getting black a third time but when clean nothing looks better. By far this is the best Corvette I have ever owned. The vehicle now really has the horse power to be called a Corvette. The handing is crisp and precise and the acceleration is enough to cause whiplash. I have installed some additions; mesh grill, wild to mild exhaust controller, CAGS eliminator, iPod interface with HD radio and better rear speakers (Focals). Other than that I can see nothing else to change.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration, improved interior, clean exterior and the slightly smaller dimensions that the C5. The complete lack of needing a key for anything but emergency use. Also the computer is much improved over the C5 version. OnStar is also a great improvement only wish phone minutes were more reasonably </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>For years I didn't seriously consider the Vette due to the "gold chain" image and cheap looks. The looks and performance of the C6 got my attention and the 08 improvements really got me thinking. I finally took the plunge and bought an 08 JSB/Cashmere car w/ 6sp and 2LT. You can't help but smile when you nail the throttle, hear that big V8 scream, and feel the tires fighting for traction. I came from Porsches mostly but I have owned something from about every sports car manufacturer. My most recent was an 02 911 Cabrio. I have to say that this is my favorite of anything I've owned. GM has done a magnificent job and no excuses are necessary. Drive one and you'll understand!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Awesome ride. In hind sight, I'd probably go with less options. Nav and XM radio are nice, but not why I bought the car. A portable nav is easier to operate and less expensive, save the money and get the nicer wheels. The (npp) bi-modal exhaust is very cool and with the wild to mild aftermarket kit, you can select it whenever you want to. Paddleshift aut is nice, but again I'd probably save the money next time and get the 6 spd manual. The hud is something you become dependent on, unfortunately it's only available with the 3lt upgrade. 25 mpg driving it with zeal. You only live once, live it in the fast lane. </TEXT>

The NPP exhaust is a must, a portable gps is cheaper and easier to use and the 6 speed manual is a bit more fun. the money you save can go towards a new valentine1 radar detector.

<TEXT>I'm still a new owner, but I think this is a great car. The power is great, and as a racecar driver, the handling is impressively good. Even my wife, who has no interest in cars, likes it. The interior has just had some minor upgrades and seems fine to me. The seats are comfortable and the controls come to hand nicely. Very little noise gets inside the car either. Unfortunately this also makes the car's occasional squeeks from the roof latches stand out more. I guess GM has a fix coming soon for this problem. Another niggle is the occasional nanny warnings from the computer. You can't open the doors with the engine running and it'll even warn you if you leave the turn signal on too long.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My First Vette - Crystal Red Metallic/ Cashmere interior. I have been looking and wanting a Vette for over 40 years, ever since I had my 69 GTO Judge. Your going to spend some money on your dream car, then don?t cut corners. I got all the options. I love the Nav System. The Z51 package is a must. Chrome wheels. The 3LT PEG gives you all you need (headsup display, heated seats, memory pkg, Bose). Six-Speed Paddle Shift w Auto modes, you have a standard without a clutch and an automatic. Remove the Roof Panel and you really improve the looks, more folks turn their heads as you drive past. With premium gas the cost to drive is less than my F150. The cost of insurance is also less than my truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dual mode exhaust gives this Vette 436 hp. Floor it from a stop or while moving 20-40mph - the wheels spin very little and the sound. You have to be there.

I use to say that the best build quality was the 67 until I purchased the 1999 and the most aggressive looking body style and bay far the best bass sound from the bose stereo was the 95. However, the 2008 coupe is by far the best overall corvette I have ever owned. My 99 was a great car with the z51 handling package but I picked up my 2008 and drove it 800 miles in 2 days and it hands down has the best ride and driver seat comfort.

The new c6 has a much nicer interior, much tighter and quiter ride, much better shifting and steering and last, but not least, the power of the new engine.

He's a really good kid so I gave it to him (he's very happy), then started looking. I didn't know much about the C6, got a recommended dealer to send me a brochure, decided going from Z06 to base is not cool. He had a red one with 2LZ and a black one with 3LZ coming in within the next two months and I bought the red one. He took pictures of it being unloaded. It is awesome. I ran out of space in Suggested Improvements, so will add: Be sure you know what you get in 3LZ before you order it. I'm not too sure about that one for $3500.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The all "new" 2008 Corvette is exactly that! From a new Jetstream Blue exterior, a revamped upscale interior, 36HP increase, and a new exhast system the new feature enhancements are extraordinary. The new Jetstream Blue exterior really stands out in the crowd. The 4LT interior (Linen & Ebony) finally puts Corvette in the luxury realm. The 436 HP puts the Vette way above any other car in the price range. The optional Z06 style butterfly exhaust makes the car really sound like a Vette should right from the start. I added an optional remote that lets me control the exhaust butterfly. I owned a 2004 C5 prior to this C6 and was completely blown away at how much better this car is over my C5.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 4LT interior was well worth waiting for. It is like nothing the Corvette has ever done. Hope they keep offering it. The Z06 type exhaust is really "fun" to play with now that I can control it. The Navigation system is very easy to use and the screen details are very good.</FAVORITE>

I test drove an 07 and didn't feel much more power than the 04. Plus the interior was cheesy. Drove the 08 LT1 and and when I punched it the first time, an involuntary expletive burst out of my mouth. I could not believe that this car was street legal. The LS3 engine is night and day from the LS2. Plus, the interior was much nicer. I couldn't wait for an LT2 or 3 and bought it that day. Run, don't walk to the dealership and get one of these. You won't regret it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>For years, I've stayed away from the Vette because of poor quality interior and poor feedback response. I've owned a S2000, 350z (modified twin turbo), Audi S4, and Lexus SC430. I can honestly say I'm impressed with every aspect of the care especially the great handling and daily livability. Feedback response is not as crisp as the S2000, but its good enough to instill confidence. The interior is so much better now, it feels like a luxury sports car (on-star, turn-by- turn navigation, radio frequency keyless entry/start, coach-like leather, and tactile sensation of each dial/button, phone). Every day, I find something more to like and I'm a hard person to please when it comes to details</TEXT>
