<TEXT>This is my second Xterra purchase. I bought a 2000 when they first came out. The changes and improvements are generous. The horse power increase is terrific. The A/C is improved and cargo area is easier to work with. I have had my new one since Feb 2008 and love it. The only change I did was buy an automatic, I have to deal with stop and go traffic in my commute. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The hp, a/c and cargo area. This is a mans truck, it handles great off road. It is bounces around a little but over I'm happy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned this xterra for a year now, and I must say it is absolutely wonderful! It has great power, handles excellent, it is very durable, and I have not had one problem with it. I must also say the sound system is excellent too! The gas mileage is not too bad for a suv, I get 22 mpg on the highway and around 18 mpg in city driving. As far as comfort it is good if you do not frequently drive long distances. It does well in the snow, and the heat is great, as well as the air conditioning is great too! Over all it is a excellent vehicle !</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sound system, And the amount of Room it has.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have my XTerra now almost 1.5 years, and I never regret buying it. However, I think, the dealership ripped me off a bit. The car is fun to drive, just a bit hard over bumps in the road. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with back problems. I frequently drive long distances, and It's a bit tough on gas mileage, which is even worse in the city. One tank filling lasts about 360 highway miles. The air condition is o.k., but not great during the hot season in Louisiana. Features, that I miss: The tank is not lockable, and the dealer told me not to buy a lockable tank lid, because this would not seal properly. The antenna can't be pushed in. The sound system is awful.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>good ground clearance much storage when the back seat is folded reliable sturdy car</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well I am a camper, hunter, and an outdoorsmen and this vehicle does it all. I also needed something to tow my two atv's to the sand dunes and with a 5,500 lb. towing capacity it is a breeze. I also considered the fj cruiser but after test driving both this was the clear choice. the xterra has more horsepower more torque and similar features, but is alot cheaper. the fuel economy is bad but for me it is worth the 265 hp and 281 ft. lb. torque. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who needs a daily driver but also spends a considerable amount of time off road.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The vq40 is a beast of a motor, absolute best in its class. love the roof rack and step side bumper. On the fly 4wd is easy to use. 4 low is like a tank very impressive. Ground clearance. stiff steering is responsive and great for off road applications. steel wheels are tough and wont damage easy</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been test driving Xterras every year since their inception (2000?) and have always wanted one. When gas went to over $4.00 a gallon in Aug 08 I knew that it was a buyers market and purchased a new 08 for $18K even, or more than 9k off the sticker price -- WHAT A STEAL..!! Overall, I am exceptionally pleased with my Xterra. It gets 17+ mpg around town and just over 21 on the hwy. It is a very comfortable vehicle, even on long trips, and the versatility of the rear cargo area is wonderful. Some folks have complained about its interior plastic, but I luv it, as all it takes is a wet cloth to clean it in a snap. The only negative is that I didn't buy two of them when they were CHEAP!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only owned this vehicle for about a month, but it didn't take long to realize this is a great vehicle. Test drove jeep grands, and 4 runners. I've have always driven Toyota's in the past, but they're too expensive. My advice is save your money and get the xterra, "everything you need and nothing you don't" pretty much sums it up, they're not fancy but they get the job done.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my offroad exterra new. After comparing and testing to the fj cruiser. I found that the exterra was much more versatile and tougher built. I drive my vehicle every day on and offroad. With the back seat folded down there is almost the same amount of room as a small truck, with the convenience of being able to put the seats back up for passengers. I've owned this vehicle for over a year and nothing slows it down. You can Cruise comfortably on the freeway, and then switch to 4 wheel drive and travel over the roughest terrain. Also it has good towing capabilities. Considering that the v-6 is more powerful than most v-8s and that it is an offroad 4x4 it gets great mpg w/out being boring.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Decided on the Xterra after looking at Honda CR-V, Acura RDX, Toyota Highlander, etc. The Xterra may seem not fancy enough for some folks, but seriously it's got everything you need. I've been extremely pleased with this Xterra, it's such a great all round vehicle, easy to drive and not a ginormous vehicle. It's straightforward, drives great and has not given me one moment's trouble in 5 months of daily driving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Xterra has its ups and downs, the engine offers nice power, but fuel mileage is bad. Sometimes city/hwy average mileage as low as 13 mpg that's not even using 4wd. Aerodynamics are terrible roof rack, running boards, fenders, back bumper steps, heavy 4wd system. The auto tranny shifts well. Cargo area offers a decent amount of space. Overall satisfied.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned everything from a Toyota Corolla to a BMW. As I have gotten older practicality and reliability are huge factors in my decision making now. The Xterra is the best midsize SUV on the market. It is also the best value. Do your own research and see for yourself. Depending on where you are in the country you should be able to get a new one at or under invoice if rebates are included. Major improvement over the old body style and engines. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 4WD is incredible for off roading and I do not even have the Off Road package. Fuel economy is slightly better than advertised if you spend the majority of the time doing the speed limit. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Xterra, it was very affordable and meets all of my needs. The only complaints are the seats are kinda cheap. Material for seats get worn fast. The other complaint is that the X model did not come with crossbars for the roof rack! Why have a roof rack without cross members and they cost almost $250. All and all I love my Xterra and the six speed makes it very fun to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Other than the problems with the hood paint we love the xterra. The hood has factory damage which appears as light swirls under the clear coat but on top of the paint. There is also environmental damage which appears as a bubble in the paint on the hood, which I am told will come off and leave exposed metal. I feel that the damage came from the dealer as the car sat on their lot for quite awhile before I purchased it. I have spoken to dealer and Nissan and they only offer to repaint. I don't want a repainted vehicle... I would take another hood off of another vehicle or a trade up with paying some of the difference if there was any. Not satisfied brand new and suggesting repaint.

<TEXT>SUV is pretty much what you see is what you get. It is a truck with an SUV body. Wasn't long until I noticed a roaring noise when slowing down. It actually causes the entire vehicle to vibrate.There is also a whining noise between 45 and 50 mph.Sometimes the shifting is very loose and makes a clanking noise. I plan to address these problems on my next scheduled visit. The gas mileage is a little better than advertised. The ride is so so. The center armrest is too far back. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought it last year, I was between the Jeep Rubicon (which i have always wanted) and this. I had to go with the better of the two, the Xterra has definitely proved a worthy truck. The manual transmission is great, the engine has a lot of power, and for off roading, it's amazing. I bought some All terrain tires, stock ones were a little dull, performs amazing in the snow. Always find an excuse to go driving, close to 10,000 miles already and planning a 700 mile road trip soon. The handling is just what I expected, it drives like a truck because it is one. Fuel I am averaging around 19, I drive fast though and with OR tires. I have had some minor problems, but nothing serious. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I absolutely love this SUV. We went from a minivan to a SUV and have been very happy so far. Already took it on a couple of 4 wheel trails and it handles great. This is a highly utilitarian vehicle that serves its purpose quite well. The affordability of the vehicle more than makes up for the so-so fuel economy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning sports cars for 26 years, Toyota Turbo Supra, Dodge Stealth R/S, I finally bought a practical vehicle (of course I kept the Stealth as well!). To my surprise the performance of my 2008 Xterra has been great, I've only lost about 1.5 seconds 0 to 60 (6.9 on timed track), handling is great and the fit and finish is wonderful. The 6 speed keeps it as a "driver's" SUV. My kids finally can fit comfortably and my over all mileage has been 22 MPG. It's a tough, beautiful performance SUV, I may just keep it forever.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned 4 Hondas of which 2 were CR-v (07 and 08). Compared to the Xterra they didn't stand a chance. The Xterra is solidly built and they thought of everything. Also you get so many features compared to the Hondas and the Xterra is customizable. I really love mine. I've had it for 3 days so far, but I am really enjoying the ride. It's high up, visibility is great, and it's built so solid. No annoying rattles, etc. The plastic interior is very high quality and I feel that it's laid out perfect. Everything is in the right place. Power everything, mirrors, doors, windows. and it came with high quality mats even! I hope Nissan keeps up with not sacrificing quality. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth works perfectly! Honda's "HandsFree Link" never worked properly. Love the Xterra's glovebox design with the 2 glove boxes, the Ipod connector, and the console cup holders are even built rugged. The Garmin Nuvi 750 Dashboard mount that hides the unit when not in use is sheer genius!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My previous vehicle was a Chevy S-10 with the Vortec V-6. This Nissan blows my old truck out of the water. It has plenty of giddy up, lots of room inside, and handles remarkably well for a large vehicle. The gas mileage I get is a lot better than advertised on the sticker. I usually get about 18 miles per gallon city. I also enjoy how quite it is inside the cabin. This vehicle is very well built.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just turned 5K on the odometer and overall I am satisfied though not thrilled with this vehicle. I did get exactly "as advertised" however. After much research, I went with the Xterra for two main reasons: I needed a vehicle that would handle New England winters and could also tow at least 5K lbs. It does both very well. At 6'1", the drivers seating is cramped. Rear seating is also cramped for anyone 5'10"+, with the front seats back. They should have added 6" of leg room in front and back. Running board is useless to me. Very tough for kids to get in/out without help. Drives more like a truck than car. Should have gone with SE model. S model=no frills. MPG is "as advertised", 14/17</TEXT>

<TEXT>I live in New England, and used to own a Ford Mustang :(. After a really bad snow storm last December, I decided that owning a 4X4 vehicle is a MUST, so I purchased the Xterra. What a fun SUV to drive! Coming from a smaller car I was worried about its size and visibility, but after only a week of driving it, it felt like I've been driving it forever. It is fast on highway, and quick to respond in city traffic; smooth acceleration, great braking, not to mention the 4X4 performance in snowy conditions. Its gas mileage improved significantly from about 14mi/g to almost 17mi/g (I now have 3k miles on it). I truly like it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love its ground clearance and 4X4 for we have a cabin in the woods and a 1 mi dirt road/driveway to get to it. I also like the fold down rear seats, it gives you a lot of cargo space. I like the steel wheels, as I do not have to now worry about curb rash.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Another great car! The 2008 may be the last in this series, so I had to buy before they change it into a cross-over! I drive a lot of interstate miles, and feel safe with higher assurance of returning if hit. Sort of a small tank. No fear of muddy country roads with the great 4wd. Did have to give up a power plug for the MP3 plug-in (bummer)!The 08 has added XM radio and does offer some good entertainment while on trips. Almost same as 05, slight loss of build quality. Noticeable looseness in rear torque conversion around 35 mph or so, not in 05. Maybe it will go away with time. Still could not get side airbag option, must be a myth, like GPS. Not an economy car.

<TEXT>Wanted the best of both worlds - hauling / towing power, decent fuel economy & off-road ability. Looked at the Toyota FJ which is not a vehicle for a family. Went back to Edmunds and saw the xterra FJ comparison. Bought the X manual 6 spd. It drives very well, it's comfortable, great visibility & a fun ride. Interior is more than sufficient for our needs. Not sure what the "cheap plastic" complaint means. I can't see anything wrong with the vehicle - I really like everything about it.</TEXT>

Three other 6' 200lb guys can accompany me into oblivion for a 5-day canoe trip and return home again nothing but pleased with the Xterra. On the flipside, my 5'2" 100lb wife and my 4 and 7 year old children love it too. Soon I'll get some proper rock sliders that they can use as a step up into the truck. For a truck that you sit ON and command, and that will do almost anything, the Xterra is remarkably quiet and easy to drive in town and on the highway. High end stereo/CD/MP3/iPod helps too. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my '08 Off-Road edition in Dec 2007. I have driven it on both city streets and highway, and have been on a few long road trips. For being a truck, Xterra offers a very comfortable ride. At the end of my longest trip, six hours, I still felt very relaxed with no sore muscles. On the highway, this vehicle will not disappoint you. Those little hills on the highway won't be a problem at all and passing other vehicles is a breeze. In the city, it's amazing. If I am stopped at a light and the light turns green and I step on the gas, it just goes! One thing I hate is the cold weather driving. It feels a little sluggish until the engine reaches the optimal level. Waiting to offroad now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've always been a Nissan family and bought our latest two, an '07 Sentra S (my daily driver) and '06 Xterra Off-Road (spouse's daily driver), in 10/06. While I rarely drove the Xterra, I loved being high up and having power to spare when I did, so much in fact that I just traded my Sentra for a '08 Xterra. Even the base trim offers great bang for the buck. The 4.0L V6 is a beast, the 5 spd A/T meshes well with it, and it came with standard features that not even my S trim Sentra came with, including cruise, ABS, VDC and EBD (traction control). It's my first SUV and my first RWD vehicle, but its dimensions are easy to acclimate to, and its handling, though still SUV- like, is quite confident.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>High-up driving position makes me feel safer than I felt in my Sentra and gives a better view of the road, has power to spare, surprisingly agile and confident handling even with the base tires (General Grabber) and wheels (16" steel), standard ABS/trac, red alert color is very sharp and gets looks!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>No question that the Xterra is fun to drive; it is rugged and has presence. Keep in mind that this SUV is built for an active lifestyle and all of its features and capabilities are on target. Vehicle handles well, sport-like in how responsive it is when weaving in and out of traffic. Smooth ride, even on uneven pavement. Truck-like in that the engine is more than enough output, very quick acceleration, powerful V6. Interior space is a bit tight, comfortable for 4. Cloth seats are comfortable and make sense for those X-treme adventures. You are seated high in the cabin, but rear seats are too upright. Lots of plastic used in the interior, but it's the best (real) SUV bargain. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The 08 Xterra Off Road is almost the perfect SUV for those of us who use it like a sport utility vehicle. It will go almost anywhere you want it to. It does ride more like a truck than other SUVs, but it also looks less like a minivan than other SUVs. You also feel like you're in a truck. The ground clearance is nice (no sharp corners anymore) and the seats make you feel like you need to duck when going into the garage. The horse power is more than you ever need on a daily basis. This is truly a rough and rugged truck. My biggest disappointment with the Xterra has been the estimated gas mileage. Sticker says 16/20, but it's more like 12/16. I get 15-16 at best on the highway.</TEXT>
