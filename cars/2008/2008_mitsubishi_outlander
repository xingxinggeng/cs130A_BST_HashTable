<TEXT>I bought this vehicle for use instead of my useless Ford F 150. I was a bit nervous about my first backroad/offroad trip but the Outlander handled great. It is almost as high of the ground as a truck so you can go through potholes and deep puddles. Highway mileage is good, city mileage is decent. It is definitely good value for money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the outlander with trailer hitch. 1 year later, trailer hitch adapter caught on fire! Why? Third party part was installed instead of original part. Went to dealer to ask for repairs to be done and to be de-damaged, answer = No! Called Mitsubishi motors Canada told the story, show pictures, answer = sorry, can't help! If the original part would have been installed, it would have been covered under the warranty but since it was a third party part, only 1 year or 20 000km or warranty! Thanks to the dealer for having installed a third party part and thanks for all the problems. In 1st year, went +/- 10-12 times to dealer for electronic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had the car for almost one year, never a problem, I am fully satisfied with the car. Drives wonderfully. I love the engine sound, excellent handling, AWD on snowy roads, and using the paddle shifters when it is time to zip away. The design of the interior is nice, offers lots of storage, and seats are comfortable. The Rockford-Fosgate stereo is unbelievable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have my Outlander for about 4 months. I was looking for a small SUV to change it for my Honda Civic. I found the Outlander for excellent price. Love the exteriors; interiors are ok. I have the base model and I love it. The outlander is good in gas, no problem with that, little change from my Honda. Has lot of space front and back seats. Little exterior noises, may bother sometimes. Overall is a good purchase, no regrets. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Chose the Outlander over several other small SUV's on the market because of bang for the buck. Love the performance of the engine and 6 speed tranny. Also very glad we opted for the sun and sound package. The interior however is cheap cheap cheap! Carpet is worst I have ever seen in a new car, plastic inner door panels and seat material are very low grade as well!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system and auto/manual 6 speed transmission feature. Exterior design of car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>While I am generally happy with the 2008 Outlander with regards to performance and comfort, I am very unhappy about the paint on the exterior. This car is not even 6 months old and it looks like every kid in the neighborhood has been throwing rocks at it. There also is a body shape design flaw that allows road debris to sand blast the front of the rear wheel fender. Mitsubishi has disappointed me with their attitude of "too bad, so sad" when I bring the subject of paint durability up with them. I would not buy another Mitsubishi because of this.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the environment controls and the transmission as well as the knob used to select FWD and 4WD.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I owned a 2005 XLS and loved driving all 101k miles that I decided to give that one to my MIL and buy myself a new 2008 with all the new features! LOVE IT!It came fully loaded with the Sound and Sun pkg, the Entertainment DVD pkg and the Nav and Bluetooth sys. Love the 6 spd automatic tran-really see a step up in fuel economy over my 2005 one especially when using the paddle shifters to accelerate! 5 cup/bottle holders in the front! OMG the tailgate! Steering wheel controls! A real electrical outlet! The Fosgate! In 2008 sticker was 32k, since it was a floor model, I walked out at 21k before my down pymt! Couldn't be happier! in the manual, it said the upper glove can heat and cool??? WOW!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Really fun to drive, love the sun roof, Bluetooth, really, really love the tailgate, the abundance of cup holders, the electrical outlet, steering wheel controls, NAV SYSTEM! Tire pressure sensors, love how you can monitor your average MPG/MPH and fast key entry/ignition!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking to upgrade from a sedan but didn't want the bad fuel economy of an SUV. This car fit the bill. This has handled great in the show and I live on country back roads so this was important. I was hoping for a little better gas mileage than it gets in the winter but as the weather warms up, it seems to be improving and I have gotten up to 27 mpg on the highway in 2wd. My 6 year old son loves it and thinks it's the best car ever! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>HID lights - love them, FAST key system w/lock out warning if fab is left in the car, Bluetooth, heated seats (placement of switch is awkward but I've gotten used to it), 3rd row option, paddle shifts, quiet running/good balance, tailgate.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Took a long look at many small SUV's. Honda CRV too sluggish, Forrester (used to own one) lacked wow factor, RAV4 V6 4WD was solid but cost $2000+ more with less features. Worried about American made being around much longer. Wanted to stay under $30k fully loaded. Walked out at $27,255 with 0% financing for 60 months (rather than another $2000 off) - approx. $1,500 below invoice. Sticker on car was over $31,000 MSRP. Fun to drive, looks good, great sound system, Fast key awesome - hope to have for a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for fun yet reliable transportation. The Outlander fits the bill. With the luxury, navigation and sun and sounds packages, the vehicle is simply awesome. Even during the break-in period, the gas mileage has been impressive. It has a very solid feel when driving and exceptionally comfortable. It fits my family's needs perfectly. My first car in the 80s was a Mitsubishi and I am thrilled I found my way back. Give it a test drive, you will not be disappointed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife has 07 LS 4wd. She likes it and I drive it once in a while so when time to replace my vehicle took a look at 08 leftover. The fun thing about this car is you have to drive it. It doesn't lull you to sleep and since I drive a lot I need to be awake. Gas mileage varies and so far best is 25 mpg in 2wd then 24 in 4wd. My XLS drives fine especially in the messy snow, wet and ice we've had this winter in NJ.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 220 hp and 204 lb of torque move this thing very nicely. Comfortable on long trips, looks like it cost more, features both standard and optional let priced fairly. Key fob, sound system, rear leg room for back seat occupants, xenon and heater/ac controls simple.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First Mitsubishi, and very happy. Great car for small family (I have the third row seat option) and ideal for economical trips. I live in a hilly area, and the power is very adequate. With care, and respecting speed limits I get over 30 MPG on a trip, and over 19 in city driving. My driving is approximately 35/65 city, highway. Comfortable, and fun to drive. Road noise is very low, and handling is quick, and responsive. Based on this experience, I'll buy Mitsubishi again!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Outlander in December 2008 after researching a number of vehicles. I kept coming back to the Outlander for its combination of performance and utility, its value, and its unique features (hard drive nav, paddle shifters, tailgate). I am very happy with my choice. The V6/6spd auto combo is very smooth and plenty powerful for a vehicle of this class. Unlike other reviewers I'm completely happy with noise levels, highway or back roads. Exhaust noise is nearly imperceptible. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This Outlander is exactly what you paid for, you saved a couple of grand over Honda and Toyota and you get cheap plastic all over, cheap tires and a wind noise inside once you hit 65. Over all solid, powerful and predictable vehicle. Almost forgot the carpet is the worst I have seen in a while. I own a 2003 CRV and let me tell you this one is a keeper, as soon as we are done paying for the outlander it's out of here. Back to Honda it is not worth saving a couple of grand if you plan to keep your car for more than 10 years. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Now that I have 5 month of driving on my Outlander, it's time to put a good review. First, the inside insulation is not at the top, your ear a lot of road noise and the exhaust system is a bit noisy. I get an average fuel economy of 18-16 in the city and 22-24 in the highway driving. It's a great suv during the winter season, you feel secure driving around. The seat are comfortable but a lite high. The warranty is great but after driving it for a couple month, if I had to choose for my new SUV now I would not choose this one. Before buying test drive it for a day or two, you will see what I am talking about.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had never considered a Mitsubishi until I was looking online at Edmunds and read the other reviews on the Outlander. I wanted a crossover but did not like the CR-V despite the fact that i've owned 3 Hondas before this vehicle. I love my Mitsubishi Outlander SE FWD. I have just over 1,100 miles on it already and we love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Best small ute in the US for sure. Mitsu got it right. 180 degrees from the old cars. Incredible performance for the buck. Seamless 6 spd auto. Great touch nav and awesome sound system. No CDs rattling around the car with the hard drive. 3.0 V6 has so much power, torque steer is an issue. Just a real nice ride. Super warranty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought fully loaded with all the extras and have never been happier. Picked it up and drove up and over the Rocky Mountains, through snow and ice etc. I got a chance to test the 4wd, the anti-skid and the anti-lock brakes (on purpose :-)). Handling was super and it really hugged the road when I tested it on the dry hairpin curves. Easy to park compared to the Dodge 3500 Diesel 4x4 I normally have been driving! Looked at the Escape, Rav and CR-V and feel like I got more bang for my buck and a great warranty. Just wait... you will see a lot more of these in the future</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a 2008 SE Outlander about a month ago (new) and it has been in service for 16 days out of about a month. Driving it gives me a headache and my clothes absorb an "odor" (been ionized 2 times in service no change), steering wheel noises with right and left turns, other things but the big one is I need a new transmission which I am now waiting for (for a new car!). I feel like there are so many things going on with this SUV that I wonder where it was before I bought it. Never had a NEW SUV with so many problems. Services has not been good either I picked my SUV up yesterday waiting for the tranny and all the other problems still exist. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Have so many disturbing problems the only thing I can say at this time is the little things, sound system, cup holders, storage and mini tailgate.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Outlander about 6 months ago, after months of researching and test driving several small SUVs including Toyata Rav4, Honda CR-V, Chevy Equinox, and the Saturn Vue just to name a few. I am not disappointed. Although the 4 cylinder lacks initial get up and go power, once its going the Outlander provides a very smooth, sporty, fun drive. Having driven a Landrover before, I am loving the fuel economy! I'm averaging about 24 mph in the city, on a recent 8 hour trip I averaged about 32 mpg/hwy. I would have paid thousands more for the options I have, the SE model comes loaded with a lot of unique amenities the competition just did not offer. Overall what a great buy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got my new mitsu outlander and it is really good, the ride very smooth. my 2.4 lacks some power but that expected and is good for low mileage. CVT is my first and it is very smooth. Turning is like a sedan, information panel is quite accessible.Lots of cup holders and power outlets. Competes with CR-V and RAV4, with a good deal it is much better than both. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I enjoy the room for it's size. Decent gas mileage. Comfortable ride and great sound system. I have sun and sound package. I just wish the DVD would work when driving if you desired. Overall been real pleased with the performance up to this point. I took it on vacation and avg about 25.7 mpg. With five people loaded down and still had room for nice comfortable ride. I would recommend the Outlander to anyone looking for a sporty look in a cute ute class. It's has more room than I expected and it looks much better than the RAV4 or CR-V. These two are good in this class, but I like the looks of the Outlander. So far the performance has been up to par.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As for the new 2008 SE Outlander this one is a disappointment. Sluggish off the line. Yes it is a 4 cyl. But no low end torque to speak of. The CVT is my first and am not impressed in one area. Slowing down it feels like the brakes are being applied. My first Mitsubishi with mechanical problems from day one. Turning left a clank. Same for turning right. Rear end screech when backing. Knocking noise mid vehicle. The dealer said they could not hear the clanking so did nothing. How about putting it up on a rack and turning the wheels? Said the screeching was the brake rotors. Normal. A first for me on any Mitsubishi. Average fuel consumption is not what we want. We want exact MPG.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style of outside and inside. Impressive to look at. Gets noticed. Vast change from the prior Outlanders. Nice light display showing useful data. Appealing SUV that draws looks. The SE is very sporty but the 18" tires take extra effort when turning. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I researched all similar SUV's- CR-V, RAV4, Forester, Santa Fe, and this is by far the best. The closest SUV to the Outlander is the Subaru Forester, but it is nowhere near as sporty, and has only a 4-speed transmission! I traded my Mercedes C240 and could not be happier. I am getting 26.3 mpg driving to work (mainly highway)- more than I got with my small Benz! The CR-V is too econobox, the RAV4 has no nav nor shiftronic transmission, the Forester is too soccer mom/housewife. Both the CR-V and RAV4 A/C is poor- can't cope with our heat! Reliability of Mitsu is outstanding for this model, could not be happier. As with my four prior Mitsubishis, your value for what you pay is incredible</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Outlander now for 4.5 months and have already put 2000 miles on it. It's a blast to drive, comfortable, great handling, sporty. Lots and lots of car for the money. I got mine with all the features, 30GBHDD, DVD player/Nav system, sun roof, Rockford Fosgate sound system, Blue Tooth, and still payed thousands less than I would have for a RAV-4 or CR-V with comparable options. I'm very pleased with the gas mileage. I actually got as much as 32mpg on a recent cross country trip. I average between 25-30 mpg (most of my driving is highway miles). I like the fact that I don't see many on the road. It feels large (I feel safe driving it) but also sporty at the same time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Just about everything! Sound system ROCKS! (you can crank it up as loud as your ears can stand it and there's still no sound distortion); tailgate; bluetooth, Nav system; 30GB/HDD, gas mileage; interior/exterior styling; tons of storage; handling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm from the Philippines, where the xls is known as the "gls sport". It's a nice cuv, with good suspension. The roads here are not too great, but after a long drive, I don't feel beaten up. Also looks good, & people turn whenever I pass by. The car's sound system is also good, and I don't have to buy anything extra just to enjoy my cd's. A lot of new friends are impressed by the exterior & interior looks of this car. It was a toss-up between this and the forester, and i have not regretted my decision in choosing over this one. the fuel consumption is ok, esp on long drives.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had our new Outlander SE 4WD for exactly one month and close to 2000 miles now with absolutely no problems. The number one priority for ourselves, and many other drivers right now, is fuel efficiency. The Outlander has delivered just what it promised with a mixed city / local driving average of around 25 MPG. For a vehicle that size and weight, sometimes carrying 2 - 4 people, that figure is more than acceptable to me and I feel it may improve even more when the engine is completely broken in. Can't wait to check it out on an interstate road trip. With good fuel mileage and the rest of the package working flawlessly, I'd rate the Outlander as a smart choice. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I would say it's the keyless entry system. It may sound gimmicky but it's nice to just slip that remote in your pocket and not have to ever take it out to start or lock the vehicle. Bluetooth hands free phone system is very nice also. Top-notch radio and CD player system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Almost made a big mistake by looking at the CR-V, RAV-4, Kia Sportage, Hyundai SantaFe and making a decision then on which one to buy. Fortunately I drove by the Mitsubishi dealer and decided what the heck, I will see what they have. The Outlander is roomier, just as comfortable and has more standard features for a better price. Was equally surprised when I found out that Mitsubishi has the same 5yr/60K bumper to bumper warranty and 10yr/100K Powertrain as Kia and Hyundai do. </TEXT>

The center armrest isn't very workable and the driver's side cup holder next to the window broke the first time my knee hit it. I've had a big problem with the steering wheel locking up.

<TEXT>After gas hit $4+ we decided a big SUV was no longer an option for us and traded our Mitsubishi Montero Limited. After driving an Outlander demo for the weekend, we picked an XLS (need 3rd row seats) and had them add dealer installed leather. This allowed us to forgo the forced combo pkgs and pick the primary features we wanted. Having driven large SUVs for many years and having a Honda Accord for our "other" car the Outlander is a pleasant complement to our family's fleet. We enjoy the overall stability, quality feel, and overall look of the car. Before you buy an SUV you owe it to yourself to drive one of these.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So I drive a ton, and I mean a ton 25k per year. This car is a daily commuter for me. Why do I love it? The car is just has everything I need. Killer stereo, great seat comfort, easy to drive, even the stock tires have worn well. Easy and affordable to maintain and it takes 87 gas with no issue. I get 25 mph in my daily L.A. fwy/traffic commute which is pretty good. Great NAV sys, as well as a hard drive that records my cds automatically. Environmental stats, and a calendar that reminds me of birthdays. Heated seats, solid control, good ac, wipers work well, brakes are solid. For what you get this car is clearly the best value in the crossover SUV market. Take a look, you wont be sorry.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Outlander XLS for almost a week now. I compared it to the Escape/Milan, Nitro, CX-7, and a few others. For the price you pay, this truck has some nice features. The FAST key is one of the coolest things. It allows you to lock/unlock, and start your truck without ever pulling the key fob out of your pocket. Great idea! The nav/stereo system is nice and easy to operate, and loud when you need it. Bluetooth hands free for the cell is a nice touch. Rear seats not only slide forward and back, but also recline. Plenty of room all around, and I'm 6'3", 240. Engine power is just fine, and in-town mileage has been at 20 mpg so far. No telescoping steering wheel, though.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>-FAST key system -Navigation -Rockford Fosgate stereo has some kick to it -Hard drive on stereo stores a ton of songs -Very good MPG for a SUV -Sporty looks and interior-doesn't feel as stale as the Escape, or as cheesy as the Nitro. -Plenty of cup holders and storage</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle is a "sleeper". Very sophisticated drivetrain, did I mention a 6 speed transmission? Tight handling, pretty quiet tires, could be better. Killer upgraded stereo, heated leather seats and the rear hatch has a lower section that drops down if you unlatch it. Great for sitting down to take off you boots, etc. Gas mileage is "foot" sensitive. Still trying to figure where it is but seems to be around 20 mpg city and some highway. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned car since nov. 06/1500 miles was one trip. Owned Mitsubishi before so stayed with brand (no problems). Had hesitation problems but service bulletin cured that. On road trip car is outstanding just sit back and put on Cruise and front wheel drive (28 mpg) around town not impressed with mpg or noisy motor, like all available features (best bang for buck). I have had no problems with this vehicle at all, what you see and hear when you purchase is what you get. I was rearended at 40 mph (car stops on a dime) and lower tailgate still opened, car took impact really well. My main pet peeve is the interior fit and finish are starting to look sloppy/lazy. Where`s that quality Mitsubishi?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I originally wanted a RAV-4, I'm glad I got the Outlander. It has a lot of pick up for a 4 cylinder, like the braking, pretty smooth ride, like the big tires. Amazed at the gas mileage, I was used to driving an SL1 Saturn. Some days I average 30 miles to the gallon, never less than 25. I really can't say enough good things about it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Beautiful exterior, love sitting up high, fairly comfortable ride, great radio and CD. Have the convenience package and I really like that. Lots of extras for a great price. Love the little tailgate, really helps when loading back.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I owned a 2005 endeavor and was very happy with it except the gas mileage. I purchased a 2008 outlander XLS v6 3.0 awd and was sorry to see that there are not any interior lights in the glove compartment or on the dials for the temperature settings, and fan speed or positions for the vent direction. Cannot set any of the 3 dials at night while driving or go from 2wd to 4wd.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It came down to the Outlander and RAV4. The Outlander looks a lot better, has a lot more technology and a superior warranty and provided more for the money. We really like the car and would highly recommend to anyone. If we had it to do all over we would buy the Outlander again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great exterior. Good handling. Safe-top ratings from IIHS, great xenon headlights. 4WD & skid control - excellent in bad weather. Flexible seating & cargo arrangements. Nice gadgets- paddle shiffters, nav, 30GB hard drive/media player, DVD player, sirius, bluetooth, etc. Great warranty.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I considered all the other compact SUVs out there including the RAV4 and CR-V before choosing the Outlander. The Outlander definitely has the others beat on price, styling and overall utility. Plus it?s a great value and costs thousands less than a comparably equipped RAV4 or CR-V. The 4 cylinder is plenty of power for me and I can use the paddle shifters to quickly downshift if I need to. The handling is very good with excellent cornering. It?s nice to drive a good looking car that you don?t see on the road often ? I get plenty of admiring looks from people.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Rockford Fosgate sound system sounds wonderful ? I was worried it would not be refined but it is. Other favorite features include: the dual-opening rear hatch, the AC outlet in the armrest, the 18 inch wheels, the power moonroof, the leather-trimmed seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I considered all the other vehicles in this class including the RAV4 and CR-V before choosing the Outlander. The Outlander clearly has the others beat on style and utility. The Outlander makes the CR-V and RAV4 look boring. Plus you can get it better equipped for thousands less than the competition. The long warranty provides great peace of mind. The handling is quite sporty with little body lean when cornering. The 4 cylinder provides plenty of power for me with good fuel economy and I can use the paddle shifters if I need to downshift quickly. Overall I am very pleased with this vehicle and might just be a Mitsubishi convert considering it's the first one I've ever owned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our last SUV was the 2002 Mitsu Montero Sport XLS. Our daughter now owns this and it is still going strong. We decided to "trade down" to the 2008 Outlander and love the car. Just like the Montero, 100% made in Japan to last. The 4 cylinder engine will not win drag races, but is peppy enough and CVT is smooth. The engine is a little on the loud side though.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT with 6-speed shifting if needed. More roomy than our Montero and definitely better gas mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was absolutely pleased with the purchase of my 2008 Outlander. Drove it home from the dealer approx. 150 miles & it was love at first sight. Then I drove it in the slush & snow. AWD was great, but then I washed the car & looked at the paint. The design of the body causes chips & sandblasting to take effect on the bottom half of the vehicle. 940 miles & my red mitsu looks bad. Put on mud flaps, but didn't stop the effect. Everytime I drive in bad weather I cringe because more paint is being stripped. Mitsubishi is aware, but has not come up with any solution. Gas mileage is good as promised. Only drive it in Fla.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather heated seats are nice. Love the overall appearance of the vehicle. Sporty & functional</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded a 2006 Montero for a 2007 'Lander and I really like my new car. The Montero was, in my opinion, a thoroughbred SUV with a peerless racing record. But with gas near $3.70/gal. here in NE Illinois, when I got a chance to trade over to the Outlander, I swallowed and went for it. I am not sorry. The 'Lander is a much more wieldy tool in traffic, goes and stops much better, and uses regular gas (the Montero needed premium). I've taken one thousand mile road trip, and the greater economy was much appreciated. It was getting blown around on the return trip, but everyone was (8 degrees, 50 mph winds).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great styling, inside and out.3.0 V6 is perfect and sounds nice. Like the ride/handling w/ 18" wheels. The interior has plenty of room. Lots of storage compartments and cupholders. Seats are comfortable. Navi and Sirius radio are great. I also love the Bluetooth. Big mirrors too. Uses regular gas.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my new Outlander out of state and recently drove it back to Texas. This little trek gave me a terrific opportunity to quickly become accustomed to this car's innate abilities. Once home, I can't believe I didn't purchase this car sooner. Everything about this car is exciting - the design, the way it drives, the technology - I simply don't have enough time to play with it all. If you are searching for an off-brand CUV/SUV that has driving personality, utility AND techno-enhanced design, then the Outlander should be at the top of your list. Go on, be different and check out an automobile that has inherent off-roading qualities perfected through years of Dakar rally challenges.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, sport seats, interior AND exterior design, utility, great highway MPG (I got 26 MPG on my trip home), incredible nav system, ear-numbing stereo system, easy-to-use bluetooth system, buttery smooth 6-speed transmission, paddle shifters, geek appeal, not driving what everyone else does.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've driven cars exclusively since my learner's license when I was 16. From a 1985 Ford Tempo GL, to a 2001 Nissan Sentra GXE, it was time for something different. Now that I'm 24, I was looking for something with a little more cargo room, a little more power, and a little more comfort for driving friends around. So I decided to take a look at the compact SUV market, and had 4 on my list: Hyundai Sante Fe, Nissan Rogue, Honda CR-V, and the Mitsubishi Outlander. The Sante Fe has a smooth, quiet ride, but didn't have many options. The Rogue was pretty stylish, but felt underpowered and cramped. The CR-V has it right, but more expensive. For me, the Outlander had a good balance of everything.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Strong engine, quick acceleration powerful Rockford Fosgate sound system. 3rd row seating is convenient. Stylish LED tail lights. Two glove boxes 9 cup holders, doesn't fit my 1 L SIGG water bottle though FAST key is the key of the future. Hands-free Bluetooth system Informative car display.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Only owned the car for over a week. For the price of a fully loaded 4WD SUV, it beats all the competitors in the same market segment (mainly RAV4, CR-V and Ford Edge). The interior is not excessively rich, but it is comparable to the competitors. The technology features are hands down the best out of the competitors as my XLS model is equiped with touch screen harddrive based navigation, bluetooth, HID headlights, full function trip computer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth. Fold down tailgate. Third row seats (it is tight in size, but it is there).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just picked up the 08 and there's one word to describe it, WOW! I'm impressed. It's my first automatic in over 20 years. I'm impressed by the pickup and the paddle shifters still give me that "standard" feeling. It's very roomy both in the front and back.</TEXT>
