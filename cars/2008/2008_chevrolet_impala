<TEXT>Just turned in my 2007 Impala SS. It was a fantastic car. Took on a few cross country long trips and clocked 27mpg on the hwy. The car always performed perfectly and had real power when I needed it. My new 2008 from the dealer (demo with 6,000 mi.) is similar to the old one. Not much change, and the 2010 are virtually the same so..... I went for the deal. I will continue to buy this venue of car (American all the way) before spending thousands more on a foreign hottie which really can't compare to the American Impala SS. The price is right and the feel is right, both in the car itself and the American pride.... "step on it !!!!"</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 08 Impala Lt 3.5 V6 used with nearly 26,000 miles on it. It was in pristine shape. It runs good ONLY execpt for my excessive tire alignment problems that the factory warranty wont cover. Yea the bumper to bumper the covers "almost" everything. Other than those minor problems and the lagging power of the V6 i think it was a great buy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Huge trunk, really like the look, radio is fantastic for just the basic stock any very roomy</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought with 34,000 miles on the clock. Immediately set off on a 5744 mile round trip to east coast from WA State. Amazed at 32.3 average mpg received with cruise set at 70 mph where possible. Several tanks at 34+. Some heavy head winds in SD and MT on return reduced economy. The suspension is too soft for my taste with excessive body roll on cornering at higher speeds, though ride was very comfortable. As others have stated the side mirrors are on the small side for total safety. Power is more than adequate with the 3.5 liter V-6. Fit and finish both inside and out is very good. Trunk carried dog crate, cooler and all our bags with room to spare. I am very satisfied with this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car for work. The Trunk is great, I have to carry a lot of equipment and it is nice. I have the SS which has the V8. On the highway it get 25-26 avg MPG. It switches from 4 cylinder to 8 cylinder smoothly, which a was concerned about before I bought the car. The Ltz owner I read the review must not drive but to his mailbox and back to get 17 avg. My 2004 GMC has better avg MPG than that (in the summer).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a Mariner that was having drivetrain problems. My car was a leftover (at the end of 08). I drove it and fell in love. The front seats are spacious and very comfortable. The car has the gusto to pull past just about any other car I need to, within reason. I do wish that I had the 3.9L engine as I have added a hitch and the 3.5 seems a bit underpowered on uphill stretches having to rev around 2500 RPMs to maintain speed. My only two complaints are the cup holders. I can't fit a large cup from anywhere in with any other cup. Smaller cups and bottles fit fine, but on long road trips, who wants a small? Also, I have been in the shop for brake pulsations twice in < 1 year.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Radio-For a stock radio (no Bose), it ROCKS!!! Ride Quality-smooth as a baby's bottom. Spacious Trunk. Small windows behind rear doors help with parking lot viability.

<TEXT>i have a ltz chevy impala, very nice car, I think the trunk is too large making this car extra large. The MPG is very low I just can reach 17 mpg, even in highway, making the company statement a big fat lie. I had try it everything to increase the mpg but still making the same, other than that i thing it is a nice car to have it. Thanks</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased a 2008 Impala LT with 33,000 miles on it and it's one of the best cars I ever owned. The car runs great. I needed a dependable roomy car for my daily 75 mile round trip to work and after doing a lot of research focused on the Impala. After finding a great deal I jumped on it. It's a great value compared to other cars in it's class. I would by another one without hesitation. Every time I drive it confirms that I made an excellent choice. The performance could be a little better when accelerating from a complete stop and the side view mirrors could have been a little bigger but over all I am thrilled with my purchase. I would recommend the car highly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Originally I set out to buy an loaded LTZ with a bench seat, BOSE sound system and sunroof in mocha brown. But after taking the SS model for a spin, just to see what it could do, I was sold. Before purchasing this car I did test drive other sport sedans, all of them costing much more $$, and nothing was funner to drive than the Impala SS! The Jewel (dark cherry) monochromatic, red compliments the car and is worth the extra cost. I added low profile tires & wheels and tinted the windows all around. It's a good looking car and inexpensive to decorate.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We turned in a Cadillac DTS and got the Impala. It has as large a trunk as the caddy and the rear seats fold as well. The seats could be improved and the a/c controls are silly but the ride and comfort approach the best. Looked at all the rivals and this was the beat for the money. Have had GM products for thirty years and the reliability has been tremendous. For the money this is the best buy.</TEXT>

Mileage is excellent and it uses regular gas. I am used to that other motorists look at you while driving a Mercedes-Benz, same thing happens with the new Impala. Love that car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am so glad we to Chevy to try out an Impala. We'd been test-driving Toyota Camrys and Nissan Altimas. But we finally went to Chevy, and we really liked the Impala. So we bought the Chevy Impala, and for less than a base Camry! Now I realize how flimsy the Camry and Altima were. The quality of the Chevy Impala is far superior. And with the 3.5L V6 we've attained 26 MPG in the city and 33 on the highway, far better than the window sticker said. I'm glad I didn't fall for the Japanese foriegn car hype. If you don't believe it, go test drive an Impala and compare. There are plenty of old Chevy's and Fords driving around, and they are easier and cheaper to fix. Most cars last with care.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I can't say enough about this car. I factory ordered the LTZ model black on black with cloth seating (as I don't like leather) and the metallic trim on the inside instead of the base woodgrain trim. This car is my dream! 18" Wheels that stand out and look like I went out and custom bought them. Two large exhaust tubes sporting stainless steel tips. I tried to create a great sports car with this vehicle and I succeded by putting two thick stripes running from to back as well as chroming out the front and rear chevrolet logo (over the default gold. A sound system is my only future plan for this vehicle as it turns heads no matter where it goes. I just want to drive it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've heard from so many people that American made automobile is not good as Japaness made. That might be true. It may sound strange. My teenage daughter wanted to buy this Impala SS, not Japaness or other imports. She said "I love Chevy". Driven about 7000 miles so far, and there was no problem at all. Excellent performance(like my Trailblazer SS). Great gas mileage for V8 engine(over 21 mpg with mixed driving). Very comfy and smooth ride. This Impala's interior may lack refinement than some foreign car's. But can they bring a car with roaring V8 under $30,000? </TEXT>

<TEXT>Having recently leased a Cadillac CTS, I expected a Chevy to be far inferior. I have driven the Impala only about 500 miles, but the verdict so far is quite positive. This is a very comfortable ride, with most of the same upgrades I enjoyed on the CTS (dual climate control, heated seats, OnStar, XM radio, traction control, Stabilitrak, ABS, etc. etc.) for less money. As to reliability, I hope that is the case (three separate warranty repairs for the CTS) and have my fingers crossed. So far, so good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a good, basic car that I now regret purchasing. Be aware that even the upgraded "LT" does not include ABS brakes. I didn't even think about this until I got it home. It simply did not occur to me that in 2008 a large family sedan would ship without basic safety features. GM should be ashamed of themselves for this kind of reckless penny pinching. Additional penny- pinching becomes more evident as you drive the car more. Features that most people consider standard in every car, such as a folding back seat, are optional in the Impala. If purchasing, make sure you verify what is included, down to the most basic safety and convenience features that you probably take for granted.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have gone on 2 trips since buying in late Dec. 2007. The longest was 1500 mile roundtrip from LR, Arkansas to Panama City,Fl. Gas mileage is right on the money to what the window sticker said. My only gripe is on the return trip, the CD player croaked after playing about 50 CD's. And the service adviser said they often have problems with "burned" cd's vs bought cd's. The "burned" cd's can cause them to hang up and not eject. One woulda thunk in this day and technology age that "burned" cd's would not be a problem. So in the big scheme of things this is only minor as it is covered by the bumper to bumper warranty and a new unit is on order.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Was looking for a car with decent fuel economy, cost, features, and size. Cross-shopped Camry, Accord, Sonata, and many others initially. Some have criticized OnStar but I'm not sure why. It's free for a year and then you don't have to pay a penny if you don't like it. It offers great hands free calling, emergency features, diagnostics, and lock out service. Have used all but emergency many times. The ride is quiet and comfortable and I notice little wind noise. Many features from heated seats to dual-zone cc were standard. For the price I paid, I would have ended up with a 4 cylinder import comparably equipped. Domestic quality is way up lately and deserves a look.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Impala is a very good value because it includes features of cars costing a lot more money. The features include: power heated leather seats, steering wheel mounted audio controls, XM Radio, On-Star directions, tire pressure monitor and Dual-Zone climate controls. It has a comfortable ride, handles well and gets excellent gas mileage for a car of its size and weight. The 3.5L motor has enough horsepower and runs on regular gas. It has a very well designed interior with comfortable seats and nicely designed controls. The braking performance is good. Prior to buying my Impala, I have rented both the 3.9L LTZ and 3.5L LT models. I choose the 3.5L engine because of fuel economy.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>NEVER AGAIN!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have had a GM car or truck since 1975. My friends point out to me that when you go back you can't complain. But, this car is a new low. After 300 (yes 300) miles the car basically is inoperable. The gauges don't work (except check engine light), no A/C, the message display says "engine hot" yet no heat. Also, there is a vibration in front end. So much for the good new car feeling. After having my car 1 day, the dealer says the problems with "my" car are very interesting. They were unable to diagnose in 1 day. My feelings are that "GM's" problems are very interesting. Maybe I just got "that" car. But, this american will turn to more reliable imports for future purchases</TEXT>

<TEXT> I have had this car for only a month but I must say that GM is really getting their act together. One may comment that the interior materials are not up to par with some of the imports but I feel the black leather looks great on a black SS. I was considering Accords,Camry and Altimas but felt the rumble of V8 and neck snapping torque was up my ally. This car is a joy to drive on the highway and zipping in and out of traffic. The fit and finish is up to speed and the handling is fair.It is a heavy front wheel drive car with over 300hp. I have over 2500 miles in one month and am just under 20 mpg's with mixed driving.I am in sales and will do another review as the mileage piles on.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V/8! Flip and fold rear seats are great! XM with the Bose and the chrome rims. Huge trunk with pleaty of room when I take my wife and 3 kids.Takes me back to my 67 GTO...

<TEXT>Every morning I go out to my car to begin the day's journey to work, a situation that will put a frown on most people's faces. But as I walk up I hit the remote starter and hear the deep throaty roar of the V8, and I can't help but think, this is what Chevy meant by "The Heartbeat of America!" Needless to say, Every morning I drive to work with a smile on my face. This car has amazing power and very crisp handling living up very well to the Super-Sport lineage. The exterior and interior are both clean and sporty, and look distinctive from anything else on the market. In short, on paper this car was exactly what I wanted, in practice, this car is exactly what I wanted!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Many reviewers have stated that the car has pronounced engine and wind noise, and I say, Thank You GM! This is a pony car after all, it has power and it has every right to show it.

The ride is about the same but the handling is a little better than my 03 was. I'm liking the OnStar so far and the XM is great...standard now on all models. Honda, Nissan, or Toyota do not offer any such thing for around $22,000 which is what I paid for my LS. It has enough goodies for me to enjoy and has turned a few heads some saying they can't believe it is a Chevy. I used to buy only foreign cars but that was when Gm had some catching up to do.

<TEXT>Rented a brand-new Impala SS for a recent two-hundred mile trip. With a nice exterior styling and a roaring V8, this car could have been a huge hit for GM. However, it lacks the refinement, features and quality that are present in even entry-level import sedans. Despite its sport pretentions the car's steering and suspension are numbed with novacaine. Transmission lacks the auto-stick feature and is neither sporty nor refined. Wind noise is pronounced The interior lacks any character and feels generations behind both in quality and in content of my 06 Civic. The quality throughout is inconsistent. Overall, the car has a feel of being designed by the bean counters for the rental lots. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is pretty good: it handles well, is pretty good on gas and is quite comfortable. It?s one major drawback is what they perceive to be a marketing plus: OnStar. It is unreliable, an annoyance, and definitely not worth the money. With so many other equally acceptable alternatives out there (unfortunately for the domestic manufacturers, most of them are foreign made) it is a shame that we are effectively forced by GM to look elsewhere if we are to be able to get a car we really want. What really stinks is that most of the rental cars are not equipped with OnStar but the general public is not offered this same level of courtesy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had the car a couple of weeks and put 600 miles on it. It's a very comfortable car, even the 3.5 has more than adequate power, I've never felt like I had to have more. I've only used regular gas so far and gotten 28 MPG. Controls are all logical. I got the leather package and seats are comfortable but could use more side support. Great room up front, but lacking a bit in rear leg room for as big as the car is. My only beef is the paint finish - the hood has 2 big "blotches" - dealer noted it and offered to repaint under warranty, but something as bad as that should have never made it out of the factory.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned over 30 vehicles, mostly GM some Ford, but compared to Cadillac this Impala is every bit as comfortable, quiet, quick, and nimble to boot. Cushy rides are important on long trips, especially if the highway isn't smooth and comfortable. This car handles predictably, and has good view all around. I had a 1984 Cadillac for 13 years and this cars ride and finish is every bit as good. The new radio is very intuitive and has excellent reception. XM AM and FM don't have to be preset separately, you can mix and match up to 36 (yes three dozen) radio combinations. Especially useful if you have favorites or favorite areas of the nation, and if you drive a lot.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The simplified cruise control and the sound system tie for making driving this car especially fun. Similar to my '84 Caddy cruise, there is an on/off and the cancel feature separate from these allows you to quickly cancel and then resume cruise. The radio is 6-CD-MP3, XM, AM, FM superior. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When loaded with leather, heated seats, retractable sun roof and a fine sound system this vehicle is nearly as good as the Hyundai Acera. The car cruises on the highway extremely well. It does not have the pep I would like but it does the job especially when fueled with E-85. This flex fuel vehicle gets a big lift from the higher octaine gasoline that helps solve the sluggish pickup problem. I found the vehicle not as comfy as my Cadillac Deville but it was nearly as nice. The price of this vehicle is right. The 28k I saved made me feel a heck of alot better in giving up my Cadillac for the 31 mpg I now get on the freeway. Good value, good on gas and nice looking to boot.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>GM is finally getting it when it comes to the small things. My vehicle comes with a stereo plug for my i-Pod and three power plugs for all the gadgets we now bring along for the ride. I also like the storage spaces where cables, coffee, spare change and such can be accessed with easy.</FAVORITE>

By changing brands of gasoline, I have increased gas mileage from 21 to 24/25 mpg hwy. I have owned 2 Monte Carlos, 2001 LS and 2006 LT and miss them both. 119,000 and 88,000 respectively. The Impala LTZ and SS are as close as you will come to the soon to be extinct Monte Carlos. The OnStar feature was a selling point for me and the Impala LTZ is priced right--good buy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>American made! The interior is luxurious and comfortable-good stereo. OnStar!! When I hit a deer on the interstate after dark, OnStar was on the phone before the car stopped rolling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is one great all around car. You can easily obtain 27 mpg on a highway trip, but combined your looking at 20- 21 mpg(still not bad for a v8). When I was purchasing this Impala I was also looking at the 08 Honda Accord 4 cyl. They were almost the same in price, but a huge decrease in Insurance on the Impala SS. I couldn't believe it. I have had no problems with this car. Chevy's are great quality cars. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 5.3 v8 (of course). 4 cyl deactivation is great for the increase in mpg. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I was at the dealership trading in my Dodge ram, I had in mind *I need something reliable* well having had my ram for only 7 months and having it in the shop 6 times had me kinda discouraged. Well I came across this impala, loved it at first sight. Unfortunately the only problem I have with the car is that every other impala seems to be the same shade of light Gray! Well that being said I love everything else! The 3.5 liter engine is powerful! And I've gotten 36 miles per gallon on the highway, and average 24.6 in the city, which isn't bad! The trunk is huge! The interior is nicely done and the seats are the most comfortable and supportive I've ever sat in and the ride is amazing! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>standard power everything,seats, mirrors, locks, keyless entry, CD player with MP3 hook up, which i hook my phone into and have conversations through my speakers,so cool! but i think when it comes down to it the tire pressure monitor and average fuel economy readouts are my favorite features! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT> We are very pleased with our car. A little disappointed with sticker mileage compared to actual. All manufacturers seem to get away with that one? However very reliable car, runs smooth, LOT'S of power. Wanted the LTZ because of more HP. Salesman said I would be happy with LT, and saved a lot of money. He was right. The traction control is a must in the snow here in Canada. Never had a problem. 2nd winter with it and reg. all season tires! By the way we found that if you order a car with the features you want it can save you money on the sticker price. Can save another thousand if you order it, as the dealers automatically tack on a thousand to cover cost of the car sitting on the lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Handles great, steering is snappy and sharp, (some say clunky, but for a spirited driver, its perfect). Combined with 4 doors and a large trunk, it's sporty and versatile. Opted for the silverstone metallic with black leather, sharp! Great stereo, firm but comfy seats with heaters. XM and OnStar are great. 303hp doesn't hurt either. Have scared a lot of tuners on the line when the 5.3L makes the tires scream (just remember to turn off the traction control). And it even runs on regular 87 octane!

<TEXT>I've read complaints about the poor vision in the rear view mirrors. On every car I own I buy the little round blind spo" mirrors at Walmart for about 2 bucks each, and put them on the outside corner of each mirror. I then have excellent side mirror vision. Another complaint I've read is about poor visibility through the rear window. Especially with a spoiler. C'mon... I can see everything I need to see through my rear window. (I have a spioler) I haven't had the car too long but I love it. Read the consumer reviews on the higher rated Honda Accord and Toyota Camery, and you'll find a much higher percent of complaints than that of Impala owners. Go figure...</TEXT>

<TEXT>It was between the Impala and the Malibu. I picked the Impala because it was bigger and advertised mileage was almost as good. My driving is 90% highway and the best mileage I have gotten after 5000 miles is 24.5 but usually getting around 23, the dealer had the nerve to put a 30mpg sticker on the car. I miss my 2000 Monte Carlo SS that regularly got 27-30 mpg. Feature wise the car is good although they cheaped out on the radio - sounds terrible no matter how I adjust it and I miss the auto darkening rearview mirror on my Monte. The heat/ac controls are terrible, every time I put my hand near it they move - to small and soft to the touch. OnStar is hard to use and people can't hear me.</TEXT>

Great comfort and XM radio is a great bargain. Haven't listened to AM-FM radio yet. Smooth ride. Heated seats are a big plus. Fantastic pick up and it turns a lot of heads with I drive in to the store or church. V8 sounds tough and kicks it when you step on the gas! Couldn't be happier with the purchase.

<TEXT>I have owned Impalas for 10 years now and love them. I prefer a larger car with some room to move over compacts and this car delivers that. The car's interior is much more refined then my 2005 was. I think the luxury package, is a great addition and I really appreciate the upgraded interior. The extra engine power in the latest model is nice and the car never lacks pickup when it's needed. The car handles well in town and on the highway and delivers respectable mileage, especially considering the size of the car. I have had this car for 6 months and have not experienced any issues with quality or reliability; from my experience with Impala I wouldn't expect to.</TEXT>

The dual climate control is interesting but not a must have. I love the trunk space and the roomy interior. The computer system that displays oil life, temperature, tire pressure, and etc. is a cool gadget. Love the remote start. The gas peddal felt a little stiff because I am used to a 4 cylinder. I like the chrome accents and so far no problems. The factory speakers are kind of weak and the drivers side leg room could be increased in the future. I tried out an 2004 Chevy Classic before I got this car and it was a huge improvement! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This Impala is a terrific family and fun vehicle. 90% of the use is back and forth to work. Between city and highway, there is a 22.4MPG overall. More than happy for a car this size. Took a road trip with 4 people, 5 suitcases and numerous other items in the trunk and averaged 29.7MPG between Chicago and Columbus. Cabin space is more than adequate. Easy handling, very responsive both steering and accelerating. My only concern is front end handling in the rain. The vehicle feels "light" and slides out easily during turns. Overall, I highly reccommend looking this vehicle over when considering making a purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Seems to have a steering response that is way too quick, better turn the traction control off if you plan on stomping on the gas pedal and pulling into the passing lane. As well, you better turn the traction control of if you see someone eyeballing you at the stoplight, or they are going to leave you burning rubber. Factory tires are junk and do not handle water, hydroplanes easy in the rain, Is quite dangerous in fact, this is a 50 mile per hour car in the rain. The steering can correct, but the tail is like a boat out of the water.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Loved the thought of a Corvette engine in a family sedan, hate the fuel mileage. Does the 1/4 mile in about 14 seconds if you can hold the front end straight and stop the tires from squalling. Dual climate control is OK, and the headlights are superb</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my '03 Impala with 3.8 liter engine for this supposedly more fuel efficient model. The old Impala got 30 mpg on the hiway and averaged around 24. This new engine is getting 18.5 mpg on my commute and if babied on the hi-way will get 26 mpg. Also, if you decelerate and then want to accelerate quickly, there is about a 1 second hesitation before the throttle will do much. Really heart stopping in heavy rush hour traffic. Disappointed that this smaller car, with an engine that shuts off half of the cylinders to save fuel, turns in worse performance and way worse fuel economy than the old 3.8 liter engine. Also, OnStar should be an option only. Why pay for it if you don't want</TEXT>

For all the torque steer issues all you have to do is turn off the traction control and the car tracks straight! The traction control applies the brakes on acceleration and pulls the car all over the place. Fuel mileage has been an avg of just shy of 20mpg and I just got under 25 on a recent highway run to Va. Sure you can knock a couple of things on the cheapness of certain things but turn the key and listen to the American muscle! It compensates for everything else!

<TEXT>If you never drove a Honda Accord, Mazda 6, Camry, or Nissan Altima, the Impala might seem like a great car. However, having driven this car for a few months now, I find it excels in only one area -- gas mileage. I get about 28 mpg average, which is great for a large 6 cyl car. Everything else about the Impala seems crude & under- developed. It's already been in the shop twice for a faulty steering part & brake rotor resurfacing (at 15,000 miles). Acceleration is rough & uneven, handling is awful, and seats are poorly designed. This is not the car that will save GM from bankruptcy. </TEXT>

Traded my 03 Impala LS last week, for a new 08 LS. great sales staff, not pushy. first impressions of car, very good.Quick test drive, made the deal, thinking that I was replacing the same ol car with a new one. Wrong! The fuel mileage is better, there is poor erganomics to the car. Cup holders are awkwardly placed in the center console. the seats are hard, unable to adjust properly for comfort. The car handles poorly at high speeds, rocks and pitches in the corners. The biggest dissapointments is the sound system.

<TEXT>I bought this car in April 2008. I traded in a 2007 Dodge Caliber SXT that was fully loaded with every option under the sun for a plain jane full sized car to accomidate our family of five. The impala is quite comfortable and has a huge trunk. Exterior styling is fairly attractive and the interior is straight forward and easy to operate. I received good factory incentives which is why I purchased the car in the first place. Most of my driving is short in town driving so gas mileage is about 19-24 MPG.

<TEXT>So far, so good with our new Impala. I was able to take advantage of the last day GM offered a $2,500 rebate which, after negotiating using Edmund's TMV pricing report, provided a very satisfying purchase price. The black granite metallic paint and 18-inch wheels give the exterior an attractive, masculine look. The front interior is very nice. I like the brushed metallic dash a bit better than the faux wood offered on the base model. Rear seat leg room is cramped if the front seats are all the way back. Performance is what I expected from the 3.5 V6. All in all a very nice looking car that I hope to enjoy for many years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For an SS i find it still underpowered. I feel when you use the symbol SS it should stand for super sport. Chevy short changed themselves on this. With some modifications to increase power it rides a little better, but why do I have to do this for more performance. There are a lot of 4 bangers out there that have as much performance for thirty grand. But still not a bad car </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in 2-door Civic, for this car. So far it runs good. The dash looks nicely grained, and wood grain finish looks good also. Big difference in fuel consumption. Front bucket seats lack thigh support, don't understand why there is no glove compartment light. There is some lag in shifting from 1st to 2nd gear. Driver front door sounds like it is binding. Rides good, a lot of features for the money, love that remote start that came with package. Wish that you could have more selections for fan speed. Thumb wheels can be somewhat of a pain. A lot of power, don't think i will buy it out at the end of the lease. Might go to the Chevrolet Malibu next.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have about 300 miles on my 2008 Chevy Impala 1LT. It has the 3.5 L Flex-fuel engine. I especially like the fuel economy, OnStar, XM satellite radio, ride quality, safety ratings, stylish appearance, huge trunk, seating for six, fun to drive, ride quality and zero defects. GM also gave me 0% APR for 72 months. What a deal on an awesome American car even though it is assembled in Canada. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The vehicle was purchased in February of 2008. I like the looks of the all black, with the cherry wood dash. My transportation has been predominately in the city, which gives me about 24-24 mpg. I have taken the car on one trip across the state of Wisconsin from Milwaukee to LaCrosse. The ride was good, and the vehicle got up to 32 mpg on the trip. It may have gotten better, but we had it fully loaded with 3 people and about 450 lbs worth of 'stuff'. That is what I find neat about this car, it's full size and the ability to get mileage that competes with the small compact foreign cars. The other thing I like is the oil life indicator, I get about 5,000 miles between oil changes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy indicator, OnStar, huge trunk, and Ipod music hook up. Found that tires need to have 31psi cold pressure for best ride and gas mileage for vehicle performance.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Excellent overall execution. This is the first new automobile we have purchased in 33 years, preferring used. But the factory incentives made this new car impossible to pass up, so we went for it and are glad we did. Great car overall. We appreciate the level of standard equipment, even in this base LS model. We did not want ABS and I'm glad it was optional on the LS so we could avoid having to pay for it one way or another. Fit and finish is excellent; no complaints or any need to return car to the dealership. The Impala is an outstanding value for the money; head & shoulders above Camrys, Accords, etc. Highly recommend that it be compared to those makes before assuming anything</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seat comfort. Cabin arrangement up front. Easily-understood controls.

<TEXT>A nice car for the money. 22 city. I like the information center, large trunk, however, it should have some type of center console with cup holders in rear seating, lighted vanity mirrors. My previously owned 2003 Impala had that and it was just a base model. This car is one step up and just the basic features aren't their. Car rides well. I did have to return to dealship first week reguarding a poping noise in trunk. Wasn't to happy about have most of the trunk torn out which resulted in finding a very large bolt apparently left in from factory going from one side to the other on turns. One other trip reguarding a plastic clip left off on right headlight panel. However, I do like my car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I ordered this Impala LTZ new in Feb.'08. Traded in a 2004 Impala SS which I thought I was going to keep as a collector, but replaced 2 for 1 (also traded an '05 Malibu). I have no complaints on the looks or quality of this Impala. Rides well, looks sharp and has been a pleasure to own. Only concern I have is that the gas mileage will improve. Have been getting 25 - 29 mpg on regular Unleaded gas as it is multifuel and just doesn't do well on E-85 gas. Have 2,300 miles on it and have every available feature. Think I have a great car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I previously drove a 2001 Monte Carlo SS after owning two T-birds (hated the 2-seater style change). Went with the 2008 Impala as there aren't many full- size 2-door coupes on the market these days. The 50th Anniversary Edition is basically an LT model with more sporty features, the car looks a lot like the SS (including same 18" wheels/rims). The car rides smoothly, gas mileage is pretty much what the sticker says (it all depends on how you drive it). I like the two-tone interior. Front seats could provide more "lateral" support. Like the heated leather seats and garage door opener. Would have liked 6-disc CD changer and premium sound system, standard sound system just ok.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been driving this new 2008 Impala LS for one week. There are a lot of improvements over my old 2001 Impala; mainly in the computer area, not mechanically. Overall, this car has good value. The LS has power window, lock, seat, and steering; cruise control; keyless entry and trunk release; OnStar; and XM radio. All these in the low end LS model! I just hope that the lower intake manifold gasket will last longer this time. Try to make a spare key (to open driver side door) in Home Depot, no luck!

<TEXT>Very disappointed in this car. If this is the best that GM can do then I guess I finally have to go the way of millions of other car buyer and buy foreign. The design of the car is a cheap knockoff of a Honda Accord. I want an American car, not a copy of a Japanese car. The interior is cheap and plastic, looks more like a Chevy Chevette then an Impala. I paid way too much for this car, even with GMs paultry "incentives". No wonder GM is going broke!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had for short time. But so far I just love it. It's hard to get used to an SS having 4 doors but I like the emblems, reminds me of days gone by. I traded in a crew cab dualy, so this is of course way more fun. I read reviews here before I bought it. And I have to agree about the wind noise and torque steer. But I bought it and like it anyway. I got almost 28 miles to gallon on a three hr. trip. That was at 70 with cruise control. I liked the steering wheel controls in my pick-up ('04 Silverado) better than the switches on the dash in Impala.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for about 18 months. I purchased it as a bit of a compromise. It has many nice features, had some zip, yet also had front wheel drive for northern winters. Turns out, not much of a compromise. Driving this car never fails to put a smile on my face. When you step on the gas, you're gone! It is by no means a high performance sports car. You can quibble about numb steering and other pretentious car guy stuff, but it has great muscle and a fun factor. The average guy, of which I am one, will have a great time with this car. A real plus, especially given $4+ gas, has been the mileage. I get 22 around town and more than 26 on a recent 1200 road trip.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am pleasantly surprised with this fleet vehicle. The efficiency, space, practicality, and good features really work well. An all-day interstate blitz immediately after delivery was a real pleasure. The visibility to the front is great and satisfactory elsewhere. I enjoyed operating the speed control from the steering wheel, and the speedometer is dead accurate according to my GPS. At great velocity, engine and wind noise are nearly non- existent and mileage is respectable. There are door pockets in each door, a glove box, console storage, a map pocket in the passenger seat, and a cargo net in the trunk. This vehicle is a great value.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Picked up the '08 SS a few days ago, and I have to say it's pretty good. Everyone mentions the torque steer, and everyone that has mentioned it is right. This car will surprise you if you are not careful. The seats are firm, but do not "hug" you like a sport seat should, but then again, this car is meant to cruise, not for SCCA solo-D. Highway ride is excellent. AFM system turns on and off real stealth-like...and the fuel economy numbers for highway are stellar for this type of engine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The SS is a good overall car. I traded in an Audi A4 3.2. There is no comparison the Audi wins hands down. The SS is a big roomy car and fun to drive, it has power and looks great but the handling + torque steer makes it an effort to drive other then in a straight line. The car is a gas guzzler unless you drive it slow.When you drive it aggressivly be prepared to get 12 mpg. If you set the cruise control at 62 mph on the highway you will get 19mpg. Driving easy around town your best gas mileage wil be 15 mpg. I do like the car for the money. People stop to look at this car and they really like the sound, most can't beleive it's a Chevy. If the new model is RWD I will buy another one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the car. Had it for 800 miles now. Avg. mileage (65% city 35% highway) has been 28.7 mpg, better than advertised. The car is quiet and comfortable, although some wind noise around front doors is present on highway. I wanted seating for 6, although the front middle seat is not usable for much more than short hops. Trunk is huge, easily swallowing our stroller, other bags, groceries and more. I have a "knocking" noise when going over certain bumps similar to a loose tie rod. Will have dealer look at it. Brakes pulsed when new, dealer turned the rotors stating rust needed to be removed as the car had been on their lot a while. Still, I'm glad I got the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We commute short distances but like to take multi-state road trips. The Impala fits in the garage and budget but flies down the highway without any strain. XM radio and OnStar's navigation are great over the road tools. Finding an E-85 station is particularly cool using OnStar. The hidden storage under the back seat is nice for the lap top rather than in the trunk. All the trip computer readouts are nice when the scenery gets boring. We also considered the new Malibu but tiny things like the 2-zone A/C and power passenger seat ruled the day. A couple of small items would have been nice, memory settings for the seat/mirrors and a wider choice of wheels. Thank goodness for TireRack!</TEXT>

It was tough to get use to at first but the power that the SS has along with the comfort of the ride is taking care of all that. I plan on doing some things to make my family sedan a real speedster. Overall, it's comfortable to drive, it's got lots of power and speed when you need it. The torque steer is something to get used to.

When it comes to hauling children or family this is the car. Something you cannot do in a Corvette.

<TEXT>I decided to opt for the Impala over the Ford Fusion and the Nissan Altima. The car has close to 10,000 miles on it and the experience thus far has been pleasant. The biggest surprise to me was the fuel economy numbers. I was averaging around 25mpg with my 2006 Nissan Altima 2.5S. The Impala averages that at similar driving speeds. However, recently, I decided to slow down to 65mph and my fuel economy jumped up to 28mpg! The interior is very comfortable and the seats are supportive. The CD player hiccuped and had to be replaced - now it works great! The ride is smooth and quiet. The engine can be a bit buzzy when the RPM crosses 2500. Overall, good choice!</TEXT>
