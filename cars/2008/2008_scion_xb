<TEXT>Bought my Xb sight unseen and was not disappointed. I've driven it to California (from Missouri) and back, upstate New York and back and Florida and back with no problems. Gets great gas mileage. I switched to synthetic oil and I average 30 mpg. Love the ease of entry and exit and the roomy backseat.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the IPOD hook-up, center gauges, roomy interior and color (Blackberry Crush Metallic)! Headlights on high beam are incredible.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car. Researched all different makes/models for 6 months prior to purchase. After 21 months and 30,000 miles this definitely was the best value for the money. Fun to drive. Comfortable with roomy. Easy to get in and out both front and rear passengers. Good gas mileage and pickup. Versatile. Does well in snow. Will definitely buy another one when it's time to replace the Sienna.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Clean lines, gas mileage(avg 28 mpg: 30+ on highway), acceleration, interior comfort and space, ease of entry even for rear passengers. I could go on and on.......</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking around for another car last august and saw this one online and fell in love. I got it within 2 weeks. I got the 5.0 RLS Series Gold Rush Mica Edition with the color matching interior and I love it. I love the CVT Transmission though I wanted a Manual. It has more power then a lot of people would think-150+HP in a 4cyl ain't bad. I have no complaints about it so far. Got it used though it looked new with only 3500 miles and now with 12, 600 it still runs like new. I'm only getting 23MPG City which I wish was a bit better but for the size of the vehicle I can't complain.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Easy in and out. Power increase that was worth the 3-4 mpg difference. Easy to drve and to fall in love with. Center guages easy to view with out looking down and taking eyes off of road.

<TEXT>This is my 2nd xb. More comfortable ride, still like the boxy look of the older style. Drives awesome. Wish I would have gotten the standard. I average about 30 mpg. Love the sound system and handling. More spacious for having 3 kids (2 young adults) no squooshing together in back. I will stay with this for along time. Scion is an excellent brand. Would like more unusual colors. My last was yellow limited edition. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I now have over 30,000 miles on this car in just over a year, and I love it more every day. I did have a wheel sensor that went bad, but dealer fixed it no problem. This is my second scion and as long as they make car that fit my needs, I will be a customer for life. For the first 10 months I was only averaging about 24mpg but just like with my first Scion, once I got towards 30,000 miles I am now averaging 29mpg and I do a lot of around town driving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The xB may be the best kept secret of the year.Mine is an awesome conveyance, [this, from someone who has owned about 30 vehicles and did for over 25 years, drive over 40K miles per year. As with my '94 Previa AWD van that has 260K and still runs well, my xB is no disappointment when it comes to reliability,[not a single problem yet],and now that it has 20K and the engine has settled in, I just observed over 30 MPG [only got about 25 whthru the Mt.s of WV, and the hills of VA/PA, [this, with over 500 lbs of luggage/demo gear plus my 230+ wt.]. It has plenty of acceleration and although suspension could be stiffer, [I could cure that for a few hundred $ in factory add-ons], it's fine, as is.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>As an impaired person, I appreciate Xb's ht. which allows for easy exit/entry It has no power seats, yet is extremely comfortable to drive and I never feel as if I am in a small or cheaply-built ride. It comes w/traction control, limited slip, tire pressure monitor, and more. I love this thing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my xB for four months and love it. You get so much car and so much safety for just $16,200. Yes, it's heavier and less fuel efficient than the old xB, but I can drive my wife and three kids in this xB with both peace of mind and some zip. I think Scion has somewhat mis-marketed the vehicle. It's a great family car, notwithstanding its looks. The side airbags, VSC and traction control, four-wheel disc brakes, 2.4L engine, and that extra weight make it a smart adult car. I drove the Honda Fit and the xD before the xB and noticed the huge difference in weight,power, and ride immediately. The xB is an incredibly safe, roomy, and practical car, one more families should consider. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great vehicle. I have put about 400 miles on it so far and have been really pleased with my purchase. The ride is a little bumpy, but going from a giant F-150 might explain the sensitivity. I love the center mounted gauges and the trip computer is so convenient. It gets kind of annoying having to switch between the clock and the other information on the trip computer, but for 17k I can push the button a couple times. The upgraded stereo is a must. It looks a whole lot better and allows for future sound expansion if desired. All in all, I'd highly recommend this car for all people of all ages. I'm 26 and my Dad, much older, wants one now. MUCH better than the Honda Fit, etc</TEXT>

<TEXT>After having a 2005 xB, I decided on a whim to go check out the 2008 xB. Right when I stepped inside this car I was sold! I took a test drive and I had made my decision on the manual. I have now have 4000 miles on my new xB and would never go back to the old xB. I can't think of anything better on the old xB except for the gas mileage, but I was willing to sacrifice that for more power. The new xB does not feel like a tin can like the older models and it is an all around safer vehicle with standard side curtain airbags. Ride is much smoother (especially in high winds) and quieter. I live in Colorado and it handles well in the snow with the stability/traction control and standard ABS.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second xbox. I love it so far. Toyota has out done themselves in the improvements to this car. I had an 06 that was recently totalled and I actually really liked that vehicle. But this is a whole new car. 1L bigger engine (almost 40% more HP), 4 wheel disk brake, cruise control, ipod/mps hookup, side air bags, more comfortable interior seats, sports stick automatic, etc. All the extras for a minimal increase in price. I highly recommend this car. Very affordable, fun to drive, great gas mileage and best of all horsepower! </TEXT>

I only have one problem and that is the FM tuner, it makes distinct clicking and static noises every once and a while, I took it back to the dealer and they said that all 08 scion xBs do that and that i should call the corporate office and file a case if I want it fixed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For the last seven years I've been driving a 1995 BMW 325is coupe. Although I loved the car, repair bills, two-door limitations and so-so gas mileage got me looking at a new car under warranty. After much research, I was ready to buy a Honda Fit. Then I noticed the Toyota xD was getting rave reviews and from there found the xB. For about $2,000 more than the Honda Fit, the xB delivers nice hp, great room and functionality and a whole lot more style. We got black, and my wife says it looks like a hearse. I think it has a 1940s' gangster car look. But we both love it! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling inside and out. A little offbeat & funky: in the xB you rise above the mid-size sea of boring uniformity. Great cargo space and everyday functionality. Good gas mileage</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fantastic car for transporting elderly parent. They can get in and out without stepping up or down to get in and out of the Scion xB. I am also a tall person and this was the one car I can sit up in with out having to lean the seat back. A good value!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am more than impressed after 2 months of quality time with my new 2008 xB. I highly recommend the rear sway bar, as you can take a corner with a $60,000 sports car (believe me, I've done it). The ride is smooth and quiet, and the new Camry 4 cylinder engine gives the 2008 xB a good boost of power when needed. Add in sports stick on the automatic transmission, iPod/MP3 standard Pioneer deck, and a 50s gangster wagon exterior, and the 2008 xB is in a class of it's own.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only put a couple hundred miles on the car, but I thought I would offer an initial review. I will come back and do another one after a couple thousand miles. Any way the Scion xB meets my needs very well. Some people keep comparing it to the old xB, and saying it gets bad mpg and its not unique anymore. Well in my opinion the new xB is a better car. It takes the highways better and as well as the city.The mpg are not bad at all, I've been averaging +29 MPG, and that's 99% city. It's got a great interior with lots of leg room for both the front and back, and I can haul all my stuff. I traded in from an very large V8 Chevy 4x4 truck. Get one, you'll be glad. Its fun, frugal, cool</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The auto transmissions sport shift feature. The abundance of cup holders, the cool center tach display, trip computer and miles till empty. Funky styling. Bright headlights. Decent stock stereo. Price and value. Toyota Reliability. Scions no-haggle price and first time buyer program. Inside space. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great little car. Not only is it fun to drive (I have the 5 speed manual) but I get looks everywhere I go. And it's so big inside! Tons of room! I only have 675 miles on it so far, but have averaged 27.5 miles per gallon in mixed city/hwy driving, which is a far cry from the 10-12 MPG I was getting in my F150. Build quality is better than I've seen in other cars in its price range, and I looked at a lot before I drove this one. If you're looking for a lower priced, gas sipping, fun to drive car, you should really check out the Scion xB. You'll love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the audio quality and the fact that I can control my Ipod from the stereo. The seats rock and are so comfortable. I love all the space inside!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is simply said as, "Well Built". I love the overall package. My vehicle is white. I placed after-market 20" chrome rims. My ride is a definite eye catcher. Riding on rims will always make a little more noise over stock rims. But it is small sacrifice for large rewards. And best of all, it's a Toyota. "Another one for the good guys". Enough said.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Over the previous design, the redesigned exterior with its contoured curves make this vehicle "a sight for sore eyes".</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a trill to drive. The Nypnotic Teal Mica gets many stares, particularly with the black and polished aluminum wheels that I added immediately. I travel frequently for long distances, so having cruise control is a ticket saver. I discovered that you can be doing 80 mhp and not realize it. One of the main reasons for my decision to purchase the 08 xB was the ability to make it a very personal vehicle, its hard to beat the value for your dollar ratio. Shape, weight and power were my second reasons.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>With the ability to add (Toyota & TRD) accessories for the interior: cargo cover, c-pillar storage and cargo net. Exterior: Borla dual exhaust, cold air intake and rear sway bar. I did an aftermarket addition: auto on/off headlights, it saves me from remembering to turn the headlights on or off.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my first Scion a couple of weeks ago and I still go out in the garage just to look at it. It is so cool. I am a musician and it has lots of space for instruments and sound equipment with the rear seats folded flat. I travel on the highway a lot and the comfort factor is a 10 for me. You sit up high and you have panoramic view out the front windows. Everyone comments on how much room there is inside. I have the nautical blue and it is beautiful in the sunshine. I have purchased a cargo bag for the back so my groceries stay contained. I love the MP3 connection and the pioneer stereo. Mine has the spoiler too! It feels very safe on the highway and very cozy to drive. Buy one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall apperance and comfort both front and back seats. Safety features. Solid feel when driving and closing the doors. I also like the locks on the key. High beams on the headlights lets you see way down the road and we have a deer problem here so they help big time. </FAVORITE>

I test drove the BMW 5 series, 3 series, Toyota Camry, and E350, and just noticed the xB by accident while at a Toyota dealership. I liked the automatic, but when I tried the 5 speed manual, that was it . . . saved a ton of money. It is fun to drive, reliable and can use regular unleaded!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My 08 Scion xB was the first vehicle I have ever bought new. I love the style of the vehicle. I wish it got a little better gas mileage though, I am avg like 25 mpg. And what's up with the 2 inch wide armrest??? That thing is ridiculous! And at least put one on the passenger side too. Other than that I love it. This is the first car I have driven where I could feel the transmission down shift when slowing down. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2008 Toyota Corolla for a 2008 xB. The only thing I miss is the fuel economy (35 vs. 28 on xB, highway). But the Scion has a lot more room and comes with more standard features, like curtain airbags for rear passengers, which I required for my 3 and 6 y/o boys, VSC and ABS. The stereo sounds great/unique, and I still haven't seen another 2008 xB on the road yet! When I get to a place I like to stand out from the rest, not possible with the Corolla which is ubiquitous. In the outside the Scion xB is 10 inches shorter than the Corolla, and inside it's bigger, oh so nice. I love this car. The purchase process was very painless too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hatchback style, abundant interior room, yet compact in the outside, not that many people have this car, so it stands out, curtain airbags, ABS and VSC all standard; avg mileage display and real time mileage/gallon, last but no least to buy painless/quick transaction.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When a friend of mine told me to go look at the xB when I was in the market for a small SUV I called him CRAZY. I swore I was not driving a box. Well, this box is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned. It has awesome power and handling. Gas mileage is wonderful since I came from a Nissan Titan. I have all the extras like the Pioneer enhanced radio, rear spoiler, fog lights, overhead console, illuminated door sills, 17" rims, and under dash and cupholder neon lights. All this makes my xB even more unique than it already is. It is a great and fun car for the price, I would recommend it to anyone. Actually a month after I bought mine, my mom bought one too. We are now an xB family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has been perfect for my family and golden retriever. After 1200 miles everything is very smooth and still fun to drive. I am getting 26 mpg with big 18x7.5 inch rims so I am happy. Went with the teal and I still think its the best color choice available. The dash area is plain but I love all the compartments. They are much more usable with added rubber pads. The drive is a bit noisy on bigger rims/wheels, but I plan on adding my own sound deadening to the floor.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded my 05 xB for the 08 xB, I wanted more power and more weight because I drive on the highway most of the time and the other box lacked power. I checked many cars before going for another xB and in all of them I felt claustrophobic, no space at all. The new Scion fit my budget and my need for more power. It will take some time to get used to the new model, at first I did not like the older xB, then I loved it. I am sure this car shape being different will take some time to get used to too. It's way ahead of its time. I love the stance of the car and the price has no comparison with any other brand. For the same specs you need to shell from five to seven thousand more. Enjoy, I do.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Drove to work, parked, and returned at noon. Dead battery. Had left the lights on. Jump started and drove to dealer. Service tech checked the lights-on warning buzzer and said ?yep, it works fine?. I have normal hearing for a 71 year old male, but the high frequency and the low decibels of the buzzer keeps me from hearing it. Dealer said call the customer satisfaction line. Called, was told similar complaints had been received, they would be happy to record my complaint, and 2009 models might change. I checked other car buzzers and can hear them all. Frequent jumping of the battery can?t be my best option.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently traded my 03 Camry LE 4 cyl. in for 08 xB. xB's acceleration is similar or better. Suspension is way more firm. I get 27 MPG in the city (Chicago suburbs), better my Camry. It's smaller outside, but it has a lot of room inside. My 11 y.o. son likes it a lot, so do his friends. On the road, we get a lot of looks from passing cars. Safety features are much better. I like the way the dashboard is configured everything is in the middle. AC/heater vents are awesome; they're adjustable all ways. xB doesn?t have a vent for the rear; however my son feels more air coming to the rear seats cause of the configuration of the vents. It?s not as wide, so 3 full size people don't fit in the back.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When buying the Scion xB I wondered if it might be a mistake on my part because let's face it the Scion name hasn't been around as long as its parent company Toyota. However much like the ugly duckling story, I found that once I got used to the boxy looks (nowhere near as bad as last year's design) I found that I love this little car! I traded in a gas loving 2004 Ford Explorer that I had named slurpy and when I filled the Scion up for the first time I found that my gas cost were going to be cut in half and still getting about the same total mileage out of my tank as I did with my Explorer. My opinion, if you can get over the odd looks of the car I highly recommend it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We had a 2005 xB, but it was totaled in a wreck. It crashed well, and we decided to go ahead with a new '08. We like the new safety feature of a side curtain airbag. The ride is smoother, the acceleration faster, and the noise level has been greatly decreased. My wife and I have both noticed that you have to keep an eye on the speedometer as you can be going 80+ and not realize it. We got 30-32 MPG with the '05, but only get 26-28 MPG with the new '08. It handles well, but I occasionally have a problem with the ground clearance. I have to be careful backing out of driveways with a sharp drop off. The "cyclops" backup light is no brighter than a regular backup light, so only half the light.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The added room inside is nice. The bigger engine is nice. I really like that it's quiter and rides smoother than previous models. I really appreciate that it doesn't look so obnoxious this time.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my xB for about a week. I traded in a 2003 Honda Element when I bought this vehicle. I have to say that the Scion, with its upgraded engine, seems to be a better car than the Element. More comfortable seats, less rattles, better handling and better mileage. I think the xB is a good value for the money when you consider expected depreciation, good mileage, Toyota reliability, and cute factor. I think you get a lot of car for the price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Decent factory radio, real solid feel, the car just seems screwed together tightly. Handles great around turns, no body roll, low center of gravity, good seats for an inexpensive car, fairly quiet inside for the price range, good braking characteristics, quick for a 4cyl heavy car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love it! It's the perfect blend of slick, unique styling inside and out and urban-living functionality, all at a great price, with a great engine, sound system, and tons of cool extras all standard. I traded in my 2003 BSP Toyota Matrix for a 2008 HTM xB. I liked the xB1 but it had too many flaws for me to consider it for my next purchase. Perfect timing for a redesign. Drastically improved exterior, interior, and under the hood over the previous generation. Still has the unique, quirky-but-cool boxy look, Toyota reliability, low base price, extremely well engineered convenience and functionality, awesome upgrade Pioneer stereo. The xB possesses that "fun-to-drive" factor in excess.</TEXT>

I was driving a Honda Civic before, and this car is so much better in every respect - handling, power, room, style, options, ride, etc. The only thing I miss is the 31 MPG I got with my old car - now I get about 27 (90% city). Even so, it's worth the tradeoff for all the other great things about this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's unique, I'll give it that. The fuel economy is a big disappointment, not expecting this from a Toyota brand and there's also a substantial amount of road noise. It's really a 'strip' car, you have to pay for everything including floor mats! There seems to be some vibration at highway speeds (over 60 mph). The upgraded radio ($389) doesn't pick up all the stations in my area and there are 2 FM frequencies: FM1 and FM2 , this is a ripoff!! Save your money!! Overall it's a good buy for the money.</TEXT>

Went out on a double date and fit 4 adults in the car comfortably. I do suggest upgrading the radio to the second upgrade pioneer if you want to enhance the sound quality in the future. I have added a bazooka subwoofer aftermarket and the audio installers could not believe the quality of stereo that came from the factory. The ride is smooth for a small size vehicle.

Which I had planned so many time with my 06 xB but could not get the nerve to do it. Given that the car was fully loaded with 4 passengers and luggage to the ceiling, the ride was comfy, power decent and got a very good 27.3 MPG running +85 90% of the trip. So over all I am very satisfied with the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I dont know where to begin! This is such a great car! It's super fun to drive and the functionality is superior to other cars in its class! I was set on buying an HHR until I happened upon the Scion. The Scion wins hands down for room! So much leg room in front and back! It easily fits 3 adults comfortably in the back seat! And the price cannot be beat! A great value! I was leery about "the blind spot" in the cargo area but I have not had any problems. The engine is peppy and gets up and goes when you want it! And another plus is the gas mileage! I have only had the car for a week but so far my average mpg is 30! that is a combo of city and highway! Try one you will be impressed!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one awesome urban utility vehicle. As more people discover that Scion finally powered it with the Camry 2.4L engine (no longer a power plant that could not pull a dead bird off a fence), expanded the interior cabin space and polished the exterior lines a bit, it should be a huge hit for Scion. Love the black sand pearl paint job (looks like a small hearse) which fits my probate lawyer profession and personality to a tee. It is certainly a head turner in west central Florida. 3100 pounds really helps the ride and feel surpass a mint 420 SEL I once owned. Europe will have a tough time competing with this ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first car at 17 almost 18. Honestly I could not be happier with this ride. I decided to go with the aqua green color (Hypnotic Teal Mica) and this color/car is definitely a head turner. In fact when I was driving, my neighbors literally couldn't believe I was driving in this hip car. So after driving the car for about a good 1/2 hour this is what I have to say about it. The car on the outside doesn't look that big but on the inside there is a lot of interior. The thing I like the most about it is just how easy it is to get out and in. Plus the seats are the most comfortable I've ever been in. Feels like they were custom made just for me. The car has a quiet interior, very smooth.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the 08 xB for 1 week, and I'm still thinking of excuses to hop in and take it for a whirl. Great room, comfort, and pep. Dig the styling, including the center mounted dash. Didn't think I'd like it at first, but now all cars should have it. Standard safety features are tops, and the mileage is better than the sticker advertises, especially for highway driving. Ride could be a little suppler, but then again, I'm coming from a midsize sedan so it's different. Ignore the reviews about the 'blindspot causing C-pillar. .It's not nearly as bad as the reviews say. Much better vehicle than the Fit, esp. w/the engine power and safety features. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I took my new xB up around some nice curves from the Rose Garden to the Arboretum in Portland, OR. This baby really rocks around the curves, and that 0-30 really helps. The xB is extremely stable, staying mostly flat with very little twisting - I'd like to see what the rear sway and front strut bars would do! Add a supercharger from TRD and we're talking head-to-head with a 328i that costs $12,000 more. Add a TRD CAI and sport muffler, and we're talking 'bout beating that German engineering. Replace the OEM speakers, though. These things sound bad as in flat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We enjoyed our 2004 xB and did not intend to make any changes. We had the opportunity to drive the 2008 Scion xB. It was immediate, my wife and I decided we wanted to own it for many reasons. First, safety. Side airbags and curtains, 4 wheel disc brakes, are new in 2008. While it is heavier than the 2004, the ride is improved, handling is improved. Also, the longer wheelbase and length, help the ride and improved capacity for a load in the back. More interior lights, outside temperature, readings of mpg, etc. are all new and part of the standard package. Have received lots of questions from bystanders, inquiring about the car. Looks good (Blackberry Crush Metallic color).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my 2008, manual, Hypnotic Teal xB for about a week and have already put 700 miles on it. It's a real pleasure to drive and has lots of features and options that would normally be found in a much more expensive car. For a relatively small car it feels huge inside and is very comfortable. I highly recommend upgrading the stock stereo to the Scion navigation system. It's a much better sounding stereo and a great nav system all in one. I'm averaging 27.5 mpg at the moment with mostly highway driving. I did a lot of research on the xB, Honda Element, Toyota Matrix and Dodge Caliber and the xB stood out as the clear winner. I couldn't be more pleased with my choice.</TEXT>

Hers has the deluxe Pioneer radio with XM. They are both white with automatic transmissions. Cannot believe the amount of stares we are getting from people as we drive.

It didn't turn as sharply as it should. On the 2008 these small problems have been taken care of. What more could you want than a company who listens to their owners? The 2008 has been refined. The price did go up a little but it is well worth it. The 2008 is the big brother who glides with grace. The ride is smoother, quieter and the big 18 wheel trucks don't make him shake. Great work of art for Scion!! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The most important is the safety features are standard. Even more room, smooth, proven reliable 2.4 engine. Don't worry, the gas mileage is not bad. I got 31 mpg on a 530 mile trip to Flordia at approx. 80 mph.</FAVORITE>

The driving performance and standard features are amazing. Average fuel economy after 1000 miles = 30.7 MPG in mixed highway and city driving. Interior space and comfort is better than vehicles costing twice as much. Toyota's attention to design detail and build quality is exceptional. Also, in spite of the xB's massive interior space for people and cargo, the great handling, powerful engine, and small exterior size of this car make it really fun to drive!

The style has improved 10-fold from the original model. It's longer, a little wider, and about the same height. Fuel economy could be a squeeze better, but I love the torque. The base radio is quite adequate, and the sound is great. The one thing I am most impressed with is how quiet the car is, road noise is almost non existent. All this and it is so much fun to drive, and to be the first one in town with a new toy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this vehicle. The interior design with the inside door cup holders, the location on the gear shift and size are great. My best friend is 6'2" and has leg room and head room in the back. The Camry engine is definitely a plus and there isn't wind or engine noise. This vehicle does 100 mph without engine strain. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded my 2004 xB in for the new 2008 xB. I LOVE everything about the new xB. I thought my old one was great, but the new one is so much better. It is faster, roomier, and much quieter. It still has everything I liked about the old one but the improvements to it are amazing. It has made my bad commute to work much easier to deal with. I would recommend this car to anyone. </TEXT>

I was looking at everything in this price range and below and found nothing but blah until I saw this. Good car, good utility, bit of a head-turner, great safety features, first-aid kit, easy in-and-out, kids love it, and my bride is off my back. It's an econo-Camry with some style. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in an 06 3 weeks ago after driving it just 3 months shy of 2 yrs. As much as I enjoyed the 06, I like the 08 a lot more, it is a much better car overall. The 06 was perfect for commuting and trips to local places. I enjoyed driving it as long I was the only passenger but with wife, two kids and occasional third party, the fun goes away especially freeway ride > 30 miles. The 08 has addressed what the 06 lacked: power, safety, cargo behind 2nd row, lack of basic amenities, cup holders, cruise control. However the MPG, cool styling, and fun to drive has decreased on the 08. For me the 2.4L and safety of the 08 was worth the upgrade. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car comes loaded with everything and it's cheaper than most popular cars out there. Fun to drive, great gas mileage and very comfy. Road noise is much better than others in its class. Very roomy, young couples with a kid or two will love it. Big folks will find lots of room. Car made in Japan which is a big plus since my confidence in domestic made products has declined to low levels. Do yourself a favor and get a GPS if you do buy one, you gonna need it for all the fun driving you gonna be doing in it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Pulled the trigger on this 2008 xB yesterday and hey, words fail me. Except for one... competency. This wagon does every task without even breathing hard. If you need easy access and egress, safety, good looks, fuel economy, and low "cost-to-own" this is your car. Technically, it's amazing, pure and simple. Electric steering and brakes, stability control, antislip, smart suspension that feels more like a Lincoln Towncar than a 4 banger entry level car. In short, the xB is a car for all people, Take a test drive and see! It's marketed for young adults but we baby boomers will not be denied!</TEXT>

Yes, it's design is not for everyone, just someone who wants something well out of the mainstream. Some will think you are wacky. Hey, that's great in my book. In short it is a joy to drive! No regrets here of yet. It is one cool car, and I am not even close to Toyota's target under 30 year old.And what are people talking about, complaining about the center mounted guages.

<TEXT>I traded in my 06 xB for the 08 model because it addressed the weak motor and added side air bags. I loved my 06 xB and it is a perfect urban car where you drive in congestion and less than 45 MPH. I do a lot of freeway driving and the new version is vastly superior in this area. I currently have over 400 miles on it and here are my 1st impressions: more solid, safer feel; performance is way up; ride noise is down; better base stereo; improved instrument cluster; mileage is down (28.7 mpg in mixed driving so far); visibility is down but still very good. In conclusion, I believe this is the best car value out on the market for what you get and end up paying. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 2006 xB in for the 2008 and I couldn't be happier. It has so much more power and the ride is so much more smooth and quiet. In addition, I feel safer since it has side airbags and a higher doorline. I do a lot of freeway driving and can merge and pass with ease now. The vehicle feels much more responsive than the original xB. It is loaded with features for the price and feels and rides like a much pricier car. My only quibbles are the blindspots in the rear corner, the width of the armrest, and the mushiness of the driver's seat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had this car for a few days but I'm already in love with it. I'm a college student and the fact that the car comes standard with so many features (power everything, cruise, cd/radio) is fantastic. Plus the car has an incredible amount of safety features (driver and passenger airbags, side curtain airbags, ABS, traction control). In addition to all that, the car is really fun to drive. It handles extremely well and really gets up and goes when you put your foot on the gas. And the car gets very good mileage for its size. I'm very impressed and I don't regret my decision to buy at all.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased this car 3 days ago so perhaps I am a little biased but I really think it's quite wonderful. We had tested the HHR, Mariner, Freestyle, LaCrosse, Vibe, and Caliber (I know I have tastes all over the place). This was by far my favorite for a number of reasons. 1. Love the look - sleek yet boxy, really stands out. 2. Very roomy on the inside, flat fold seats, great interior, already used to center gauges (thought it would take awhile) 3. Better fuel economy than what I traded in (2002 Suzuki Vitara) 4. Price (great deal! I was going to have to buy used until I found the xB) 5. Engine is nice, not too small anymore, great feel of driving. Check it out! </TEXT>

<TEXT>After a lot of research, I found that most cars simply do not accommodate tall guys like me. This one is S-W-E-E-T! I am absolutely thrilled with the vehicle. Utterly dependable, Highly "customizeable"(new word for me there... lol). Mileage could be better, as this year has the aging Camry 2.4L. I am averaging about 34 mpg, with mixed cargo and passengers. This is the fourth Toyota I have bought, from the '76 Corolla, to my convertible '81 Corolla SR5 w/the 3tc. Kicking myself for ever selling that one, but the Scion more than soothes those old wounds. Summary: great head room, decent mileage, and always great to be the first on the block with a toy. Two BIG thumbs up!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cruise control is a little quirky, but is adequate, stock stereo is wma/mp3, But iPod jack is in center console - don't know what they were thinking there. Rear door takes some getting used to with key control (have to press "unlock" twice. Seats are really firm, but suitable. Overall, great car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>... my Scion xB is still living up to my expectations with zero problems and gas mileage consistently over 30mpg. With 69.9 cubic feet of storage with the rear seats folded (more than a Jeep Grand Cherokee at 67.4 cu.ft.) The xB can carry a lot of stuff if needed. Bottom line is that the Scion xB is a great value, reliable, efficient. Negatives are few at this price point. Ride can be a bit intrusive on bad roads but still solid. Interior plastic scratches easily... that's about it really. I am always looking for a replacement for the car that I currently drive. Just to see if there is something that would work better for the price. I haven't found it yet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is an impressive step-up from the previous generation. The xB handles well and feels overall very solid. The suspension is seriously lacking: you will feel every speed bump or rough road. The fuel economy is unimpressive, but this car was not designed for that purpose. It is extremely roomy and rekindles my love for driving. Every time I'm behind the wheel I'm having a blast. The cluster gauges in the center are weird at first, but easily you can adjust to them. The sound is very impressive in the car. Overall really great vehicle backed by the quality Toyota engineers it with.</TEXT>

All city driving hasn't went below 24mpg. I am young and like to go fast so I dont pamper the gas pedal! I smile every time I look at this car and have been noticing a lot more on the roads as more people are catching on to how practical this car is!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love plugging in my iPod then forgetting about where it's at and controlling everything through the steering wheel and head unit. Cruise is great, awesome pickup and handling even with being a box! I actually prefer to not have the armrest because my arms rest right on the center console and door</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My mother in law bought a 2006 and then traded for a 2008. I just had to have one with the wheels and spoiler package. 30,000 in first year, small accident and seat warped. Then pulled too close to curb and pulled inner fender out. Tried to trade on anther toyota product and found it was worth 6500 less than what I had paid for it. Wanted a Yaris for fuel economy but bought a loaded KIA M/van for 50 less a month than a base yaris. Also trim on roof blew off going down interstate and hit another car. POOR WORKMANSHIP ON SCION. You can tell it is the LOW end of Toyota. Back seat bottom is cheesy and uncomfortable. Gas mileage dropped to 22 on interstate driving depending on type of gas.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With the 2.4L engine from the Toyota Camry makes the xB 2.0 a sporty little box that actually turns heads in a positive way. While I wish the automatic had the 5 speed transmission of the Camry, it shifts without a sudden jerk and scream of the revs from the down shift. I love the lounger configuration that allows you, as a passenger, to sit with your feet up from the back seat. Handles like a sports car. I couldn't imagine how it would handle with all of the TRD options: supercharger, racing springs, sway bars, etc. Interior has enough room for my son to sit comfortably behind me (6'3" driver, 6'4" in the back seat. Wish it came with roof rack option. Load cap. 850 lbs., that's four adult males.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats & headroom a tall person would love. Raked street rod look. Excellent stock configuration. Cargo capacity with rear seats down. Smooth ride. Sporty handling. Tinted windows.

<TEXT>I've had my xb2 for about 6 months and I love it more and more each each day. I average between 30-34 mpg. Everybody that gets inside simply can't believe how much space is in there, 5 can fit quite comfortably. I call it my TARDIS. I live in the Rocky Mountains and so far its handled the snow very well. Just be careful, this puppy sits very low, only about 5'' of ground clearance which will be lessened when I put on the TRD lowering springs ;-) That's one of the best parts of the Scion brand; there are so, so many ways to customize your ride. So if you're looking for a fun hot hatch and you buy anything else, you chose wrong. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Although I am outside the standard age demographic, they let me buy an Xb anyway. After years of driving a fairly large SUV, I was looking to go smaller and more fuel-efficient. I looked at a handful of other sedans/wagons and the Scion Xb was the only car in which I felt comfortable (I am fairly tall). In the others cars, I was either staring into the sun-visor or hunching over to see out of the front window. The Xb also has enough back seat and cargo room for traveling with my kids, a worry I had in giving up the SUV. On a recent trip, we fit four suitcases and three bags of golf clubs in the back. No more worries on space. I also got 31 MPG on that trip.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the driver headroom, backseat leg room, and rear cargo space. The Xb also has a fairly peppy engine that gets good gas mileage. I cannot understand how I ever managed to drive a car without the direct connection to my iPod. Finally, I like the funky styling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looked at and drove all the contenders including Fit, Element, Matrix. But nothing really came close for the price. My last vehicle was the King Reliable Toyota Previa minivan. But I wanted something much more efficient but just as reliable. I do handy work and small remodeling projects for a living and needed some hauling ability. The Scion xB has been doing the duty for over 4 months now and getting 32 mpg in the process. The key to higher mpg numbers is in the 5 speed manual and coasting techniques. I'm always looking for something better but I don't think anyone has made it yet. For now the xB rules. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car for my wife because she wanted something roomier on the inside and smaller on the outside. This was the perfect vehicle for her. She traded her Honda Accord for this vehicle. Built entirely in Japan, the quality is top notch and has yet to experience any problems. I can't believe that I can sit very comfortably in the backseat despite my 6'4" frame and the font seat is the same. Headroom is excellent. The four cylinder Camry engine has plenty of get up and go but I wish the average MPG were better. We do mostly city driving and average 24 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Scion name when it was made was new edgy and had just about everything for everybody. But just like modern bands, you switch a member here and there, and before you know it the name Scion doesn't mean what it used to mean. Take the xB for example, the old one was great, small engine, loads of room. Sure it could have used a bigger engine, but fuel mileage for space was what counted. Then they messed with the image, put a bigger engine, but also a bigger chassis. The result is a car that is no longer what it used to be. Toyota, um, Scion just took themselves out of the market that the Honda fit has all to itself now. The xD is no better and looks too much like the fit to kill any edge.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Loads of room, but it's too much. Rather have the engine upgrade but same size xB as last generation. Great if you want a van with better mileage. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 8 years of driving two Mercedes in a row, the xB is a big improvement! 24 mpg in town, inexpensive to insure and license, accelerates and handles great, FUN to drive, great visibility, comfortable on 600 mile trip, parks easy, hauls a lot, looks cool, stereo with IPOD dock is the greatest, 15 mile commute to work is enjoyable, holds the road on hills and curves along the Missouri river bluffs, handled great in mid- west ice and snow. Ability to add Toyota Racing Division parts makes it something I can personalize, Toyota reliability and service is reassuring. My Mercedes was always in the shop, my xB only goes in for oil changes. Think inside "the box." </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>#1: xB has EVERY safety feature my Mercedes had (except the 3 listed below) and that was critical. GREAT stereo GPS mapping, fold-down seats, my friends say the back seats are MORE comfortable than the seats were in the Mercedes! They fold down for hauling capacity. My dog loves it! ROOMY storage. </FAVORITE>

I added floor mats, interior leather, a sway bar, XM radio, it has the 2.4 L engine motor which is very adequate, zips in out in traffic, park just any where, I'm getting about an average of 33 to 34 miles per gallon, very consistently, no racing here, very easy on the throttle, and coast every time I have a chance, it is easy to do it with standard transmission, I love this little car, go ahead buy one, you will enjoy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Scion xB reminds me of my last new car, a 1979 Volkswagen Rabbit diesel only much larger. Fun to drive, stable and safe handling, great brakes too. Quiet and powerful engine. Very responsive steering. I'm using a fuel additive that increases my millage about 15%, I'm getting 30 in town and 37 highway. Very easy to get into and out of. Now the bad. Poor seating position, steering wheel too far away, pedals too close together. Driver armrest is useless, same for the door armrest. Very little back support, seat too short, poor all around visibility, windows too short and windshield too far away. Clutch travel is too long. Needs sound proofing in doors and roof.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, ESC, antilock brakes, AC, feels very roomy and safe. Great headlights! I've had my xB six months and 85000 miles so far. The best thing about it is it works and is very reliable. Audio controls on the steering wheel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>For the price, this is one of the best vehicles I've owned. Quick, nimble, practical, reliable, and stylish. Fuel mileage is adequate, but nothing to brag about: 18-20 mpg city, 27-32 mpg highway. Above speeds of 70 mph, and/or with the a/c, the fuel mileage drops quickly. The interior is quiet, and visibility is very good, except the low top of the front windshield causes me to stay back from stoplights a little more than normal. Drawbacks: only one speed for variable front windshield wiper, no lock on the glove box, and rear seats are not comfortable on longer trips. Overall, the XB is inexpensive, reliable, roomy, and a great value. I highly recommend a test drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought my xB last week & I'm very happy & impressed. This car almost has everything. It's big enough of to fit 5 full adults with still enough cargo space but not too big to park on a compact parking space. The MPG isn't so bad considering the trade off. The center speedometer takes awhile getting used to but it's an a safety improvement. It's very ideal that side curtain airbags and VSC come standard. If you are shopping for a bigger car, give this car a try. Take it for a spin & decide for yourself. & if you do, we look forward to reading your reviews here.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I reviewed by driving and reading (Edmunds, of course) a lot of cars for over a year before deciding to test drive the xB. I was impressed immediately with the comfort, practicality, drivability, and value of the Scion. I wanted a car that I could haul stuff in, sleep in if necessary, and would look smart around town doing so. I quickly put a hitch on the end to enable the transport of two bicycles and can state you cannot tell two bicycles are mounted to the back end. The car has easy ingress and egress which makes my elderly mother happy. The sound system is great and how many value cars come with stock tinted windows? Totally cool. This is one quick, nimble, easy to drive car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>A blast to drive! Mine is the 5.0 release series, in gold. (only way to get a factory sunroof) as a 55 yr male, I get a lot of looks, and laughs as well. Has a "gangster car" interior feel to it. Tons of headroom, lots of space between you and the windshield. Front seats-backs a bit soft, but accommodating. Takes a little to get used to. Low seating height, high door sills might be a problem for shorter drivers, but is really where the vibe of this vehicle comes from. Definite blind spots in rear pillars. 4-speed auto-trans ratios are perfect. Some reviewers mention the need of a 5 speed, I disagree. I don't believe the 2.4 motor could pull it. Too quick to downshift. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our first xB in 2003 manual transmission, it works we have over 150,000 miles on it. We needed a 2nd car with a little more room and an automatic...The answer was golden - the 2008 xB with the moonroof. It is just the right size, fun to drive, with the larger engine, the gas mileage not too bad. However, it does need some noiseproofing... Nevertheless we love our new goldmember. Now we're going to bring it to Lombards (the Car Stereo Store) in San Luis Obispo for serious Dynamat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am absolutely in love with my XB! I traded in my Cavalier coupe and I am loving the room in the XB. My fiance who is 6'4 could not fit in my old car and was amazed at how much room the XB has. Everyone that sees the interior is shocked at how big it is since it looks so small from the outside. I got it in white and I love the way it looks with the tinted windows and the dark interior. Very happy with all of the standard features, I have not added any options at all. I shopped around for almost 6 months trying to find the "perfect" car for me and this is it. When compared to other similar vehicles, the XB really gives you more features for less money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought this car about 3 days ago and already I can see some fantastic features. Some of the notable upgrades from my '05 Chevy Colorado are the center mounted gauges that make it easier for someone like myself being 6'3", to see them without the steering wheel interfering. This is the first vehicle outside of larger SUVs and some of the larger extended cab trucks that allow a 6'+ person to sit directly behind a 6'+ driver and not have to be awkwardly positioned to the side. Last thing to mention is that the only upgrade I have with mine is the improved sound system with the stereo head unit that includes the RCA outputs, which is the best system for the money that I've seen yet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning a Mazda3 sedan for a year then a Ford Escape for a year I finally found the vehicle that is perfect utility tool. Has the gas mileage and comfort of a car with the hauling capacity of an SUV, all while being a great eye-catcher and conversation starter! Right now on my MPG display it says 33 mpg with 120 highway miles and a touch of city. I usually end my tank with about 26-29 mpg which I can definitely live with. The only problem I have with the car is that the interior dash and exterior paint are both extremely easy to scratch. I have a small dog and he has done his damage. Both the Mazda and Ford.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the shape which enables you to haul practically anything (just hauled a desk last week). Ipod control, full power features standard. I actually like the low center console, it fits me.

<TEXT>I have had this car for a week, but have found it all that it is advertised to be and the other reviews accurate. As an engineer, I research all other potential vehicles thoroughly. The xB is without doubt the best value for the price. My attitude is that a car is an appliance and must meet a list of needs. Scion has created a very utilitarian vehicle -- I don't care about all the style discussions. But you might. The vehicle has all the advanced safety features and incredible space with seats down. The vehicle has all the expected creature comforts and is of expected Toyota quality. Ride is firm but comfortable. MPG on first tank was 30 mpg mixed on hilly PA highways and city.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety and utility. Quality. Good fuel economy despite the over reaction to increasing horsepower from previous. Comfort, quiet, and space. This is a super value -- look around and you can find this vehicle for invoice -- don't believe the pricing claims by some dealers. I paid $14500 + destination</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a nice car for money with very good room inside. Very good quality and lots of nice features for nothing extra. I would recommend getting none of the add-ons unless you are absolutely sure you need them because they really reduce the economy of the car. Great combo of power, build quality, ergonomics, price. Only negatives are the fuel mileage (you have to make a trade for the power & I?m still getting 26), no arm rest for passenger, and engine is a little noisy.

In December 2007 I got my license, the xB, and a TRD cold air intake to go with it. Now, the handling, acceleration, sound - everything is amazing. I just can't help hitting the gas a bit to show off. The CAI sounds amazing under load. My iPod is hooked up 24/7, and I always have it playing whenever I'm in the car.

I was amazed how spacious the interior was. I slipped in and out very comfortably and felt the ride was extremely easy to handle, zippy pick up. The interior was 2 tone/very stylish. I passed on the $400 "Teflon" treatment from dealer and found 5 step Simonize Teflon treatment for $20 on eBay. I did get the spoiler & remote starter, mats. Also ordered side molding and touch up paint. I didn't start out to buy the limited edition,but dealer had only one,and I felt in love. Getting about 24 city, 28 highway. Lots of fun </TEXT>

The improved model boasts a larger, 2.4 engine with A+ pickup. Tighter, smoother suspension and a quiet, roomy cabin make this car a true delight to drive. I've added alloy wheels, rear bumper guard, rear sway bar and Sirius satellite radio. I like the extended trunk room and revised dashboard. The price is right for all the extras, quality and satisfaction you'll find with the 2008 XB. It also handled the road very well in the Western New York/Buffalo winter. I have no regrets buying the 2008 XB. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's all good! Love the bigger engine, seats are very comfortable, roomy cabin, tighter stability and road handling. The cabin is nice and quiet. Easy to enter and exit the vehicle. It has great pick up on the open road. Favorite Feature: The smile it brings to my face when I'm driving my XB!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Dropping down from an SUV to a small vehicle to make my commute more economical was my motivation. Scion xB has continued to amaze me as I use it for everything from Home Depot to camping. Plenty of interior space and it drives like a little sports car. What more can you ask for from a vehicle priced well below 20K that lets you do everything an SUV or truck can do. The new xB sacrificed MPG for more pep, and it's a great trade-off. I've had my xB for almost a year and its running like a champ. Getting about 25 mpg in mixed driving. If you need a little commuter car with big style and plenty of room (I'm 6'0") then this is your car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ipod Jack that displays on your deck, great stock pioneer system. 60-40 fold down rear seats allow me to have a car seat on one side and still fold down the other seat. lots of cubbies and cup holders. More power out of the 2.4L Camry engine. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned my XB for about a month and had several upgrades installed by the dealer. The upgrades are cold-air intake, front strut bar, rear sway- bar, pioneer sound system. The original 16" wheels/Goodyear tires have been replaced with 18" alloy wheels/Nitto NeoGen tires for better handling. This car has a lot of room for a big guy. I'm 6'4" and 290lbs. This is the first car I bought (other than a muscle car) that I enjoy driving. The XB is quite responsive for its size. The new engine size has plenty of power for the normal driver. I have been very impressed with the way this car is built. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is spacious even for a big person. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>i originally wanted one of the "old" XBs, but by the time i got my finances in order, they were gone. having since driven one of the older models, i'm happy to say i'm glad i went with the '08. while many people might point out the decreased MPGs, it should be noted that the decreasing MPGs aren't for no reason. the '08 is much safer than the previous models, it doesn't blow all over the road during inclement weather and it's quite a bit more powerful. while there definitely are things that need improvement, I'm confident when i say i don't have any plans to purchase another vehicle for some time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>EXCELLENT build, mileage, performance, and quality in ITS CLASS. Keep that in mind. My wife traded in her Chrysler T&C and she fell in love with this car. We have two kids and its so roomy. The windshield is huge and impressive. The bigger engine helps pull this small car in traffic. Its about the same size as a BMW X3 and had gotten positive comments from family and friends who never liked the previous models. I'm more of an Acura guy and I have to give respect to this Scion. I would purchase it. Always test drive first.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove the Scion XB in November just after Thanksgiving. I looked and looked at all other available cars in this class. Bought the Scion XB on 8 Feb and absolutely love it. I bought front and rear stabilizer. Tightens up the chassis even more and it corners like a banshee. Was going to lower to improve handling more but find it does not need it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I upgraded from my 2007 "2006" xb. I could not achieve the 30-34 mpg. I averaged 26 mpg, so i went for the 2008 for the performance. It gets the claimed 23 mpg. It is a camry drivetrain and platform, and it rides like a camry. Good acceleration. Smooth ride. All the bells and whistles that were only options in the '06. Are present in the '08. Bigger rear storage area. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was so impressed with this car when I test drove It I put a down payment the same day and I bought it the next. It has everything I was looking for in a car, 4 cylinder engine, a lot of seating room because I am 6'1" tall, decent fuel economy without compromising performance, safety with six air bags, and toyotas legendary dependability and longevity. The brakes stop firmly without the ABS overly intruding. The steering is not soft or hard it is just right. The car takes corners without to much leaning.</TEXT>

The performance of the car is not great, but if you get the TRD performance exahust and the cold air intake, it really helps. The exterior design is amazing. When I'm stopped or just driving around I get people stopping and staring. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a fun car at an affordable price. Lots of safety features which I really appreciate. I put on about 30,000 miles/year and safety is very important to me. I like the solid feel of the xB and its quiet ride on the highway. The engine is quiet and powerful. I have the manual and it shifts like a dream. The best shifting car I have ever owned. I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a car that is fun to drive and yet quite practical to own.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>had to trade it in</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Had a very high expectation level for the 08 xB. The Camry engine was a plus, except for my actual 26 mpg on the highway. Over all, I just didn't find it enjoyable to keep. It was difficult to see stop lights, poor color selection, the rear bumper is a dust and dirt magnet, the style gets a bit long in the tooth after only 6 months. Couldn't slow down the rear window wipers.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of power. style is better than the 06, more room, the MP3/iPod inputs and good trade in value.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After owning this car for 7 months and 4,500, the car feels just like the first day I bought it. Honestly this is one of the most fun car to drive on the road. For one it's very spacious for a small vehicle. There's ample head room and leg room, and it fits 4 passengers very comfortably! The seats are firm but comfortable, I love the odometer and the way its displayed, it doesn't distract you but it's very easy to read. A/C is very strong. Also the package I went with inlcuded an upgrade head unit plus an ipod connection which I can't live without. The car is very smooth while driving but a bit noisy but since the music is on it doesn't bother me at all. This car is a steal for your $'s!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>iPod connection, back row seats folding down, the car is a head turner, lots of cup holders, tray under the backrow, technically a hatch back which makes hauling things a breeze!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my xB for three weeks and I believe it is an excellent automobile. The ride is quiet, responsive and it is extremely fast. The 2.4 liter engine gets up and goes and I get around 26 mpg overall. It has alot room inside and the stereo can rock you like a hurricane Consumer magazines have rated this car very high and its styling is unique. My family calls the xB the silver pearl and we discuss continually about who gets to drive it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>What a box! I can get everything in from my drum set to my bikes. This is a very spacious car on the inside. I traded in an Element for this and I am very pleased with quality, the options, and the car is "stuffed" with airbags for safety and the electrical accessories are top notch. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is exceptional! Between the extremely sharp looking exterior (midnight blue with tinted windows, it always stands out in a parking lot) and a functional, amazingly spacious interior this car has it all for a very realistic price. I can't over-emphasize the spaciousness of this car. Sit in one and you'll see what I mean. We'll drive the hell out of it until Toyota comes out with a hybrid version of the Scion xB or an electric and only then will we make the switch. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The upright, comfortable interior. Lots of shoulder room. The improved styling over the original. Stock stereo is great. Ipod and Aux ports. 5 speed manual makes this car actually sporty. MPG is good too at 25+. Fold down seats to load a large amount of cargo if necessary. You can even sleep in it. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>AZ xB</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>This car feels big, but drives small. The xB covers the fundamentals very well for an inexpensive car. There is enough room behind the rear seats for regular stuff and a ton of room with the seats folded for big stuff. The base stereo sounds really decent, which was a concern because head units are not installed until after you buy the vehicle. Power is good. I have yet to find myself wishing for more. Shifts can be a little chunky, between first and second especially, but it?s not too bad. Manumatic will probably go wholly unused. Overall, the pros of this vehicle dwarf the cons and I would say to anyone that the xB is worth a look, even if you?re shopping the small SUV market.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The xB feels solid. Good amount of power and never stuck waiting for it. Stereo/iPod/XM integration & sound. Access at all 5 doors. Exterior style. Safety features galore. Dead pedal. Rear seat folding process. Discovering nice touches e.g. glove box lip, hatch hand hold & rear cup holders.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>08 XB review</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>08 XB=car is OK but very noisy at freeway speeds. Mileage is low at nfreeway speeds...26mpg at 75mph. Engine just revs too high which is noisy and high revs also reduces mpg. Needs 5sp/6sp auto as in 07Camry. Traction in snow excellent for front wheel drive with standard traction control. Performance is good. Handy as heck...short vehicle yet big room inside. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Disappointed</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I got mine after I read the favorable consumer ratings. I made a wrong decision.The driver seat is so uncomfortable and wablly, I feel like I am sitting on a half inflated ballon. A small bump on the road would send this car jumping all over because of the very soft suspension. The ride is punishing. If nothing else, the car should be recalled for lack of suspension. Toyota's focus should be balanced and away from selling accessories at the expense of comfort and safety. I do not want to buy the firmer lowering kit for better suspension. What an arrogance on toyota's part to have only one color of fabric for the seats!I have had this car for almost 3 months now and it is already rattling.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car looks cute. No doubt it is a head turner. It has a lot of rooms inside. It handles well in the highways. It is sufficently powered and very easy to park. I was also attracted by the standard ABS, traction control and stability control. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I came from a Nissan Frontier to the Scion. I was originally going to get a Tacoma P/U but the newly designed xB really caught me by suprise. I loved the options. The nav with the Alpine audio is a must ! Great quality sound and a whole host of sound quality options. I got 26-27 MPG consistantly (60%HW, 40% city). The center dash gage mount is a bit funky. The first week I had it I got a speeding ticket, I did not realize I was going that fast and with the speedo to the right of driver's sight, I did not know. The multi color neon floor lights were fun but not worth the option cost. Unfortunately, the car was broadsided (pass side) and totaled. If it were not for the curtain AB, my wife would have died. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navi system with Alpine audio. Couple with iPod cable made th car sound like a studio fantastic. Gas mileage good. The new 2.4L Camy engine is super quick. The split auto/manual tranny is fun if you want to drive it like a sports car. Like the over all amount of room in the car. </FAVORITE>
