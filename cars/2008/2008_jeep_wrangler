<TEXT>I bought my Jeep Saraha Unlimited in August of '08. I traded my Honda Ridgeline because I wanted to drive American. Big mistake! The Jeep is very underpowered. If I even tow an empty 5x8 enclosed trailer, I know it is there. When I tow a single Waverunner the Jeep struggles and revs excessively. It is a good off road vehicle, if that is what you are looking for. I have had Jeeps before and this one was an improvement in areas like ride and interior comfort. Keep in mind that even with the longer wheelbase, the ride is still that of a Jeep. It is a lot of work to take it on a trip of 300 miles of more. It is affected by small amounts of wind and the interior is noisy. Not recommended by me. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation, remote starter, and trade in value. Some how they do retain their value very well. I also liked the three piece removable top.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded a 2006 Mercury Mountaineer for this Jeep when it caught my eye at a used dealership. The four door Jeep looks great but its not built as good as it looks. The 3.8-liter V6 is a bit under powered for a SUV especially on interstate as it shifts in and out of overdrive. When the cruse is set it will very 5 mph before it shifts. I find the seats uncomfortable especially the backseats they set up to straight and with no adjustment. There is not enough storage for small things like glasses or change. I have the hard top with removable "T" type tops and the Jeep is fun to drive on a nice day but I think I would take the Mountaineer back in a minute it had more power w/better fuel econ. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the Jeep in December of 08 and bought the 08 because they were trying to get rid of them for the new 09s. But the Jeep has been amazing! We've yet to use the 4wd but we want to. Its been to the shop once for a mechanical problem. It has the freedom top and we love it! The Jeep has been a good vehicle. The only bad thing is the back seat sits straight up, and a car seat is pretty hard to fit in there! But overall a good buy. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Freedom top, 4 door, fun car and decent gas mileage. V8 would suit the car better. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Wrangler!!! I really wanted the Rescue Green (it was the color of my '96 Cherokee), but couldn't find it with the options I wanted. I got the "S" package and it rocks! I do have the annoying door/latch rattle and the back lift window has leaked a few times in the rain, but definitely not the Freedom Top (keeping my fingers crossed). The design of the water drain stinks . . . water runs right into the car when you open then door when it rains & the doors need the hinge stops. They should include the tool needed to take off the back top too. Other than that, it's been a blast and I get a lot of Jeep waves & flirty smiles for being a little chick in a hot ride!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The dual top, the power package and the fact that there are four doors. It now makes a fun truck more family friendly.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have owned our Jeep for a little over 1 year and are in the process of having it towed for the 4th time back to the dealer. Three times for the throttle body light and once for a problem we have heard referred to as the death wobble. The entire front end shook so violently that it rendered the vehicle uncontrollable and impossible to hold on to the steering wheel. The Throttle body issue although not dangerous leaves me without transportation and Jeep wants me to buy an upgraded warranty to pay for my own rental. At best the vehicle is unreliable and uncertainty steals the fun out of driving it. The door hinges are rusting under the paint and causing the paint to bubble. Lemon. Run</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned Jeep Wranglers since 1974 and I have yet to be disappointed in any way. I have owned 8 all together and at the present time I'm in a 2008 Wrangler Sahara. I don't work for Chrysler, so I don't get employee discounts, and I still buy Jeeps. I feel safe and free to travel at any time in any weather that the Michigan climate can dish out. My job depends on me showing up for work every day bad weather or not. And my Jeep Wrangler gives me this feeling. I know what to expect and what not to expect from a Wrangler, same as you would from a Corvette or a pickup truck. I am very pleased with all my jeeps and I at the age of 60 years old I don't plan on any changes. Thank you.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's a Jeep. It doesn't look like every other vehicle on the road. Very dependable! Fun to drive, you have a convertible in the summer and a four wheel drive in the winter.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 60 years the Jeep as we know it and have come to love is very much improved, but sadly, with much more to prove. I personally own the 08 Jeep JK, Sahara, Wrangler "California Concept". I got a great deal, considering the bad economy but read my other comments below to appreciate my findings.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior: Very manly and beefy looks and the wider stance offers better handling on the highway and better ability to take corners harder. Interior: Much more room than ever before and I like the seats capability to "rise or lower" just by cranking a lever up or down and the power windows are nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have wanted a 4-door Wrangler since they first came out. What was I thinking? The first 9 months were awesome, fun to drive, no issues. Ever heard of "death wobble". I suggest you look it up before purchasing any Chrysler product especially the Wrangler. There is a reason it is called death wobble. One reason is it scares you to death. The other is that it could cause you to have a fatal accident. It is a violent shaking of the front end of the Jeep that you cannot control. I found out, unfortunately too late, that this has been an issue with Jeeps for several years. And people wonder why we don't buy American.</TEXT>

<TEXT> My 6th Wrangler. 5th new one, bought on 10/10/07 in Barberton, Ohio. Love the Wrangler vehicle, but this one does not compare to my other ones. Body style is awesome and comfortability is fine. Problem is the clutch is going out. Never had it off road and I've driven a standard shift my entire life, so I know how to drive one. Took it to the dealer yesterday and the tech told me it was the bearing that pushes in on the clutch was rusting. Causing the bearing not to spin properly. Touch the clutch pedal and the squealing stops. They ordered the part and said I could get it put in next Wed or Thur. Then the service writer called me back and said it was not covered under warranty. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE> Top is not as easy to take down as the earlier models. You can't put a toneau on without taking the top frame off. Interior panels scratch too easy too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my 05 Wrangler for the 08 Wrangler in Oct 07. I like the way it handles and being a Jeep owner for 40 years I appreciate the comfort. I'm very disappointed in the roof leaking. I have given up on the dealers attempts to resolve the problem after three repairs it's worse than ever. I had to remove the carpeting and replace the front seat covers because of water damage. I have electrical problems resulting in the vehicle not starting, leaving me stranded 25 miles in the back woods.The jeep dealership has been unable to find the problem. I already have over 50000 miles on the car and have spent lots of money attempting to resolve the problems. I wish I'd keep my 05 Jeep.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned this jeep 3 months and in the past month have had nothing but problems with it. The fan belt has come off 4 times. The dealership had to replace the motor at 1664 miles, put on a new alternator at 1700 miles and it has been in the shop for a week this time waiting for a new power steering pump. Every time I drive it in snow deeper than 6/8 inches deep the fan belt comes off which then causes the power steering fluid to spray all over the engine compartment. Now when I use the heater I have to open a window to get rid of the burnt power steering fluid smell so it doesn't make me sick. I haven't even taken it 4 wheeling yet. These are definitly not the Jeeps they used to be. Don't buy one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the ride and comfort and handling(when its running). It's actually a fun vehicle to drive. Also the heater works a 100% better than they used to.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Jeep but after having a GMC Jimmy there's no comparison. Steering is light but responsive, corners well and the highway ride is much improved over past generations. Noise is still there but not dominating. Engine isn't a powerhouse but with the 6 spd that's up to the driver, and it can go fairly well. No problems with the roof or door seals. Suspension is firm but in town it doesn't have a problem absorbing northern Alberta potholes. If you want a cushy ride, buy a Crown Vic. I plan to have this thing for a long time, and so far so good! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good seats, decent outward visibility, great tires and rims and (with hard top) handles northern Canadian winters quite well. Pay the extra for the infinity sound system w/ sub!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my third Jeep Wrangler and the best one yet, comfortable and stylish. The all wheel disc brakes are a nice feature, very comfortable seats, its a blast to drive. Negatives: The side doors leak bad in rain, there is a TSB#23-002-08 (Tech Service Bulletin) to repair the problem for free. It will take a full day at the dealer for this to be completed. The engine power is less than my 2000 Wrangler on the highways.</TEXT>

True, the engine shifts a bit more than one would want and the milage is quite poor, but one purchases a Jeep for other reasons. Love the flexibility of the freedom top. No issues with water leakage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a 78 CJ 5 and loved it. Have had trucks every since. All have been 4 wheel drive. My new Jeep has been a joy. Mileage hasnt been an issue since I have driven 4 wheel drive pickups so the 22 I am getting is a plus. Not a speed demon by any means but I am not into raceing. The thing will turn on a dime and handles great. Serves the purpose it was purchased for. It really does turn heads. Stereo is nice addition. Love the 3 peace top. Have had no leaks and wont have top on much in the summer. Heater doesnt keep up with the low single digit but its a Jeep. Will go anywhere.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Originaly bought to tow behind our A Class RV. This it does with no problems. After towing down to New Mexico and using on the highway for journeys bup to 300miles and now using off road on the forestry trails etc we can only say what a great fun and accomplished vehicle this is. Easy to use soft top, fantastic go-most places, great turning circle and handling make it a fun, fun, fun car. Only downside is after a few months you feel it would be even better with at least a five or six speed auto. No I dont want a manual thank you. Ratio between third and top is to wide. Overall my wife and I rate it a "Thumbs Up". Dont try and think its something its not. Just drive it and enjoy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first Jeep I have owned. I had a salesman who told me that I was buying a fun vehicle that would keep me smiling and enjoying the outdoors and the kids would never want to get out of it. It was not for commuting or long trips. He told me it would be noisy on the highway because of the flat front and box design, it would be bouncy and not great on gas mileage. He has been right on all fronts. I did not go out to buy an economy car, a smooth ride or fancy interior. Thats not what Jeep is offering.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very pleased with the seats, around town driving is smooth and the engine is quit(I have the standard. Height of Jeep (kids love sitting up high). The sound system is great. Heater is better than I though it would be. Controls easy to use with standard. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought my first Jeep. Oh my gosh it is awesome. My friend had one in high school back in the midwest and we used to mud every weekend and it would never stall in the water. Then he got a stinking Toyota and you couldn't go through six inches of water before it stalled. I love mine so far. I have only put a hundred miles on it, but it rides amazing. I am taking it up to the Sierras this weekend to check out the off roading. The only bad part is it is so nice I don't want to get it dirty. It is nice to own a piece of American History. My wife and I already established we will own this forever. With a lifetime warranty why not!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a brand new 2008 Jeep Wrangler Sahara and it is junk. 1,500 miles and so far 4 problems. Massive Freedom top leak that leaks down on the dash into the radio and speakers everytime it rains. Muffler heat shield loose. Drivers side heat shield loose. Factory Sirus radio TSB issued because radio sounds like speakers are blown out. Trading a used car in because I wanted the security of a new jeep and what a dam mistake. Car has been down at the dealer for 3 days now. Didnt want to give rental until i called Jeep directly. Jeep will only give $40 a day. Jeep quality is horrible along with gas mileage. Cant wait to see what goes next. I reccommend to anyone the life bumper to bumper </TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow! After owning my 4-dr. Sahara now for several months, I still look forward to every time I want to drive somewhere. First of all, the hard tops do not leak if you put them on properly. The most important thing is putting the panels on in the right order and tightening from side to side until both anchors are tight...nuff said. This vehicle can maneuver, brake, corner, and is very smooth. What other vehicle on the market looks cool, has one of the highest resale values, is a great 4WD, it's convertible, virtually waterproof, and is practical and fun to drive? I would've liked a lil more power, but there are upgrades to handle that...good job Jeep!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The MyGig navigation/entertainment system(more advanced for the money than anything in the under 50k price range)rocks, the hard top is easy to remove, excellent looks/functionality, remote start/tire pressure warning, all the upgrades available through Mopar(and they do make the mirror kit..fyi)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the 6th Jeep I've owned. It's very well built. The seats are very comfortable. Sirius satellite radio is awesome. Gas mileage is 16-17 with most being around town so far. The hard top works well with no leaks so far and I've been out in quite a bit of rain. My only true concern is how underpowered the engine is. It upshifts on any type of hill and just needs more torque. There's room in the engine bay for a larger gas or diesel engine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased the 2008 Wrangler Unlimited Sahara, and it a joy driving it; I wish the 4 doors had been out a few years earlier. This vehicle is well adapted for the off road environment, more like amazing. It?s able to maneuver the harshest terrain. I find it to be the most solid built vehicle I have ever owned, and I have owned many SUV's in the past ten years. My average MPG is anywhere from 18.4 to 19.3, this is better than my King Ranch F150 (2WD). No buyer?s remorse here.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love myGig stereo and information center, the removable hardtop. When in passing, other Jeep owners will give you a friendly wave, as if welcoming you to the Jeep family. Don?t get me wrong; Jeep is not for everybody. Test-drive a Jeep Wrangler, and just maybe you?ll get bit.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Nothing better</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I had reservations on buying a Wrangler after reading the "expert reviews". But I always wanted a Wrangler- and after seeing the 2008 2 Dr Sahara- I had to buy one! I never even test drove one...now I have driven it nearly 5,000 miles- including a 1,500 mile trip over the Smokey Mountains w/ ave of 21 MPG and as high as 23. I know perfomance is not of my Hemi Ram, or Corvette...but better than my Tahoe or Saturn Ion. I expected comments on it's great looking exterior- but nearly everyone remarks on how "nice" the interior is appointed... The ride is very smooth on interstates-seats are very firm and supportive...cannot wait for summer to take the "tops off"! Why did I wait to buy this Jeep!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It puts "fun" back into driving! A very compact 4x4 vehicle that I can drive down a narrow lane to my cabin in the woods..or take off across country on interstates and enjoy a great trip. Other Jeep owners always wave when they meet you...and ask and compare to their Jeeps- fun!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Wrangler. Had an '02 and '04 and just traded in my '04 for the new '08 model. The engine on this model is significantly more quiet and has better pick up and gas mileage than my previous models. The additional 6" of length and width also make the new model much more comfortable to drive on the highway. I got the 2dr Sahara with the MyGig Navigation and the Power Group (windows and locks). The MyGig is awesome, loaded 2GB worth of music. The new softtop is cool because you can fold back the portion over the front seat without having to remove the entire top. My wife, who currently drives a Z71 Tahoe, now wants the 4 door Unlimited with Freedom Hard Top! I highly recommend!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this Jeep, it's my first one and I'm totaly satisfied with the ride and reliability. I only have two problems, one is that the roof leaks (I have the 3 piece hard top) and the other is that the front bumper gets damaged to easily. regarding the first problem with the leak, I brought it in and the dealer changed the rubber seal,(that didn't work), I called the dealer back and he told me that this has been a problem with the freedom top and to bring it back in and maybe I could get a one piece top that doesn't leak. The problem with that is the weight, you would need 3 people to take off the roof(boo).I'm just gonna wait and see what else jeep can come up with to fix this problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a two door automatic with a hard top without the s package. It is a basic Jeep but it will do everything I want it to do and more. I have had 5 previous Wranglers but this on is so superior in every way it is ard to belive. It is a Jeep so jthe ride lets you know you are driving not sitting on a couch. With the hard top it is secure and quiet. It does enjoy gas, but I knew that when I bought it. The rear seat acccess is awful, but I don't ride in the back seat. Water runs in when you open the door in the rain and goes right into the door storage pocket, so only put water proof stuf in it. It is a Jeep you deal with it and sit back and enjoy the ride even if it is a little rough.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Wrangler is the most fun SUV I have ever driven. I am amazed at how the Wrangler can corner like a car. There is little or no lean in corners. Its a little under powered but nothing terrible. The ride is really quiet with the hard top, but honestly the ride is bouncy. No blind spots but I did put small mirrors on it. Gets tons of looks from people. The 2DR has very little space for cargo, but back seat removes easily. Awesome seat adjustments. Awesome view when driving! You can almost drive this truck like a car. Getting in and out of the Sahara is not pleasant for short people. Seats are comfortable. Stereo, dash is high and close. Fog lights are awesome! Bumper is killer. Love my JK!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Really fun to drive. Awesome in the snow! No Lean in corners. No blind spots. Killer bumper. Fog lights double view range. Awesome heater! Comfortable seats.

<TEXT>This is my third go-round w/ the Wrangler. I have owned a '95 YJ (College), an '03 TJ(first married), and have now settled into the 4dr JK (w/children). The new 4 doors are functional with the new additions to my family and I do not have to sacrifice driving a cool vehicle. This is not a speed machine by any means, yet is fully functional for on road usage and the offroad capabilities speak for itself. The gas milage is fair given the ride height and lack of aerodynamics. If you own one of these you are in the club. If you want an Escalade experience when driving then keep shopping. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Four door functionality and storage space in the cargo area. 3 piece modular hardtop is pretty nifty with regard to ease of removal. FYI, Soft tops are not that difficult to remove and install once you get the hang of it. It is all part of owning a Jeep!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Owned 03 Liberty, traded it for 08 Wrangler 4 door in mid-September and love it. We avg 300+ miles a week commuting and the car gets between 17- 19 miles a gallon. Seats are comfortable, car handles well. Gets lots of looks. Owning the Jeep is like owning a piece of Americana. This car is steeped in tradition. Once you remove the soft top from the rear, and the hard top is on, there is plenty of cargo space. Handles well if you're driving along at 70 plus miles an hour. Yes there is wind noise, but mostly at high speeds. Nice speaker system. It's 50-56 dollars to fill the tank @ $3.00 a gallon when close to empty. Nice hidden compartment in the rear to hold an ER Kit. I'm extremely satisfied.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hard top easy to remove the front two panels. Need a 2nd person to remove the rear portion of the hard top. Fun to drive. Plenty of cargo in the rear. Rear seats in the four door easy to pull up and down. Front seats are very comfortable. Love the auto starter for the cold winter months in MA.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My husband and I have owned ours now for three weeks and it is the best Jeep we ever owned. We have had Jeeps all our lives from the years of 1977, 1986, 1993, 1999, and 2002.This Jeep is a smooth ride, handles very well, almost like my Eagle Talon TSi all wheel drive I owned in my early 20's. Not as luxurious as my 2003 Suburban Z71, but I didn't order it with that expectation. It actually came darn close. Who wants leather and plush seats in a convertible that is expected to get wet. Can't do that with my Suburban. Simply put, we love it and it is a better ride than a 2001 Cherokee and larger than one. The new Jeep is so quiet you cannot even hear or feel the engine idle or shift up or down when driving.

<TEXT>My 6th Wrangler. 5th brand new one. a 97,2000, 04, 95 (used), 06 and new 08. 97, 00, and 95 had 2.5L 4 cyls. 04 had a 2.4L. Downshifted constantly. 06 had a 4.0L 6cyl. 08 has a 3.8L. The 08 gets a couple MPG better but the electronic accelerator lacks. Body style is awesome. Interior, driver sits against the door and the biggest problem is the trip set button. They stuck it right behind the window washer/wiper lever. Every time you reset the trip odometer you get a window wash too. Overall I like it. Disc brakes all the way around are an improvement too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>OK, to start off let me say I'm a foreign car guy. Ever since my first experience with taking my 1995 Dodge to the shop on a weekly basis it's been nothing but imports. That being said, this is the best product Jeep has put out in quite some time (but don't forget those beautiful little words?Lifetime Powertrain Warranty). I have 2500 miles on my 2 Dr Sahara so far and it is rock solid. No squeaks, rattles, in fact the ride is nothing short of spectacular for a vehicle with it's suspension type and the short wheelbase. Sure, it's not Lexus quiet, but that's not what you're buying. There is high speed wind noise and you aren?t going to win any road races, but that shouldn't be expected here.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's a Jeep - not a Honda, or a Kia, or a Toyota. The MyGig infotainment system is one of the best on the market (IMHO). To have this as an option in a Wrangler is crazy. Just get it; you won't be disappointed. Add to that, topless driving and that it will easily climb a wall and you have a winner!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've had 13 Jeeps between the two of us in our lifetime. From a 77 Cherokee to the most current model year, an 02 Grand Cherokee Limited. Retiring a 93 Wrangler that was my daily driver for the last 13 years for this model and we both are extremely pleased! The ride is impecably smooth even for a Wrangler but so much more car like. It is so quiet you forget your in a Hardtop, unlike the 93 Wrangler with the hardtop. People had trouble hearing me on the cell phone. Unlike the 4.0 in the 93 which could be heard easily, you can't hear the 3.8 motor and you forget you have it running. Factory remote start rocks! Opt for it, it's worth it! It's 10.5 inches bigger than an 08 Liberty!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The remote start rocks! The amount of room is incredible! Jeep specs say it's 10.5 inches larger than a Liberty! The incredibly smooth ride.

<TEXT>I have owned several Jeeps. A 94 Cherokee and 97 TJ Wrangler. After a brief and dull experience with a Chrysler Town and Country minivan, I got my Jeep back. Yes, everything about the Jeep is, well, Jeepish. I have the hard top model so wind noise is not that much of a big deal and I like the fact that I can take the front panels off on a nice day. They are light and easy. On a rainy day I have seen the top leak once and after reseating it not more leaks. I have the manual 6 speed so power is not that much of an issue. Get the power and door lock option if you have a child. My wife hates that we did not get this option. </TEXT>

Trans shifts smooth, quick, and hardly noticeable. Very fun to drive. 3500 miles in 5 weeks, doors off 4 times. Love the room of the 4 door. You wouldn't be afraid to drive this to a black tie event. Gets lots of looks and questions. The electronic throttle is diferent,. takes a little getting used to. Could use more power. Mopar needs to offer post style mirrors that go in top hinge when doors are off, got mine off the internet. Really enjoying the amenities cruise, a/c, elec wdws, pwr locks, 6 disc, sirius.

<TEXT>This is my first Jeep. I have never even ridden in one let alone owned one. I have heard so much about them and all the stories were true. It is super fun to drive and with all the configurations of the top and windows, there is no limit to the look and feel of driving this vehicle. I previously owned a 2004 Durango and the gas mileage on this was horrible. I am currently getting 19.4 mpg in my new Jeep and very satisfied with that. Pulling up to red lights is interesting because everyone wants to know about it and other Jeep owners ask "So, how do you like it?" I say awesome baby! Just remember these things are built for power, not speed! No need for a radar detector!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a very fun vehicle to drive. Gets lots of looks, so be prepared to be asked questions, primarily how much they cost. I guess people think they cost a lot more that they do which makes it a value in itself. The only thing I have to remark on is the position of the arm rest, both on the door and the console. I am 5'8", so not abnormal in height for a woman....the center console is pretty low and there is no arm rest on the door. However, keeping in mind that this is not a luxury car and not bought for comfort, I really can't complain. Love it, love it, love it and really happy with the Jeep!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Although I have only had it a couple of weeks, I am fully pleased with the Wrangler Unlimited Sahara. I left behind a Cadillac CTS at the dealer and really haven't looked back. The Jeep's ride is not as bad as some say. You should know what your getting, but I was actually pretty surprised by how comfortable it is. Power and mpg suck, but I am going to address that with the savings on payment and insurance costs by adding a cold-air intake, exhaust and flash-programmer. From the documented dyno results, I don't think I will have any complaints going forward. Final word: practical, 4 door convertible. The REAL "ultimate tanning machine!"</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had the Jeep about a month but I am extremely pleased with this purchase. I've had numerous compliments on the color (Red Oyster) and the style (Sahara 2D) and have taken the top off and on multiple times as the rain dictates. It is easy and comfortable to drive in the city and on the highway. The sound system is fantastic and it gets better than expected mileage (~16 city/21 Hwy). It is extremely maneuverable and I can park it right beside my '03 Suburban in my garage and open both doors. I wouldn't have gone for the satellite radio or navigation system but they came with it and now I wouldn't want to do without them. I'm a Jeep man now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had 2 Jeep Cherokees, but didnt realize I never had a real Jeep till I bought this. I got the limited slip rear axle, and rarely had to use 4wd through a fairly tough Illinois winter. Have had no problems thru 33,000 miles, get 20 mpg, hauled my 21' boat to Canada, my camper to Oklahoma, and many business trips. My only complaint is that whenever I take the freedom top and doors off, the Jeep disappears (my wife takes it!) If I had to do it over, I would have gotten the power windows and locks, but other than that, I have no complaints. The 4 door model is practical for families, and it is just so much fun in both the winter and in summer, with the top and doors off, it rocks></TEXT>

<TEXT>This Jeep is our 8th in 20 years, and it's quite an improvement over the previous generations going back to our very first CJ-7. We use our Jeeps as daily drivers and they spend a considerable amount of time off-road, camping, hunting, fishing, and exploring. Jeep has made the Wrangler more comfortable in all aspects, plus it's still highly modifiable (like a big Lego set) and we have purpose built ours to fit our specific needs. If you demand luxury and on-road perfection, then this model is not for you; however, if you need a 4 door with above average off-road prowess (and can embrace the inherent quarks found in an open top Jeep), then this is the perfect vehicle for you.</TEXT>

Will roll backwards on the slightest incline when you take your foot off the brake and you are in Drive. Have to use a lot of throttle to force a downshift when climbing any grade. Leaks in around top of doors. Rear window washer hose comes loose and sprays fluid all over the interior. Engine is noisy when you first start it at 20 degrees or below.

<TEXT>Have owned lots of suvs including 3 Jeeps. The Unlimited is the most capable. It can haul more inside than a Grand Cherokee. It tows my trailer with tractor easily. Lot of leg room front and rear. JK's are 4" wider so there is shoulder room. AC is powerful as is heater. The 6 speed is smooth shifting even when it is -11 outside. Nice stereo system. 1st birthday with 18,000 miles. Not a single problem. What else can you ask for? Bottom line: Where else can you get a 4door 4wd, convertible with a great ride and unlimited options for under 20 large? No wood, no leather, no separate climate control, no fleeting styling cues. Just solid performance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I will give credit to the fact that the new style rides and handles a lot better for everyday driving. The tractions control is a feature that should never have been added as I have found while pulling out into traffic on snowy roads the vehicle hesitates to get going and have almost been hit. There also seems to be a power band in every gear which gives it a sluggish feel when accelerating, not impressed!! I think the people at Chrysler should have just stuck with the 4.0 litre. The tire pressure sensor likes to come on when its cold out and the "Change oil" indicator comes on and doesn't shut off even after changing the oil?</TEXT>

<TEXT> I love Jeeps, have owned them for years and find this one to be much "better" or more well rounded than previous models. The power of the V6 is barely adequate but with the stick it does OK. Not sure how one would do with less than the 4.11 gears in mine. Fit and finish is good, the paint is flawless. The seats are comfortable for my bad back, large enough to use my portable lumbar support. It rides better than previous models and handles well too, given it is built primarily for an off-road vehicle. Soccer moms, forget it, you would not find the rough ride is a good replacement for your Lincoln Navigator. The only problem I have had and continue to have is hardtop leaks.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the Wrangler, instant convertible or hardtop. This vehicle is rugged, none better if you like this type of rig. It handles well for what it is too.

<TEXT>This was the first American car purchased in the last 20 year. Along with the Jeep, I own an 08 Acura MDX, 04 BMW 3-Series convertible, and an 06 BMW 5-Series. The Jeep is exactly what I expected; the complete opposite of these vehicles. It drives like a truck and has minimal luxury features. You either love it or hate it... And after the first extreme snow storm here in New England, I love it. The Jeep does exactly what it is supposed to do. The 4-wheel-drive plows though and makes you feel quite safe even though you do not have a lot surrounding you. There is not a lot of power, cannot accelerate quickly, but you can get yourself unstuck. Excellent quality and value (so far). BUY JEEP </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Definitely opt for the power options (remote key-less entry, power windows). The sound system is also decent and has a pretty good sized sub woofer in the back. Sahara Pkg.-- The different suspension makes it smoother on road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My third Wrangler. This one is best by leaps and bounds. Power is adequate for highway use, but another 40 hp would be welcome. Handling is much better than earlier iterations. I bought an X with the 24S option package. Adding the Limited Slip rear axle, rock rails, extra skid plates and the Freedom Top. To date, I've had no issues of consequence. A minor, but annoying rattle in the driver's side. A pillar was traced to an over-tightened screw in the plastic trim that stripped out the plastic. Going up one size fixed that. A minor rain leak between the halves of the top was corrected by cleaning the sealing area and silicon treating the seals. 18/25 mileage so far. I love this beast.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>No other vehicle offers as much customization and after-market hardware. It's easy and inexpensive to personalize or configure for insane off-road adventures.

<TEXT>This is the 6th Jeep I've owned and the best, although the 47 cj2a was almost as fun to drive. The power to fuel economy ratio is fine for us. With a catback exhaust and k&n air filter we brought both up. By selecting the x with s pkg. Along with locking diff. And sway bar disconnect we have all the offroad guts we need without geting the more spendy Rubicon. Also Jeeps are for the most part made in the USA and by not retooling design every year are more eco friendly and less expensive. My only change would be a seperate swing away spare tie and drop down tailgate.

<TEXT>As soon as Jeep came out with the Unlimited (4-door) Wranglers, I knew I wanted one. I only have 2000 miles on it so far and can't really comment on reliability (been great so far!). Otherwise I love it! Design gets all 10s from me -- from the outside in, it's a Jeep! And the drivetrain seems to be as solid as they claim. Love the freedom tops. Sound system is much better than older Wranglers. Road noise with the hard top is not bad, which surprised me. Handles well on highway at 80+ MPH, which is also surprising (though it wanders a bit). I'm a big guy, and interior is very comfortable for me. Fuel economy? I gave it a 10 because it meets my expectations. It's a Jeep, not a Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Besides the horrible experience with the dealership, we found others now, we love our rig. Bought it in Feb. "08 and put into storage in Washington with 1234 miles. Bought a home in Vegas, fly back, picked it up, loaded it and a 6x12x6 ft cargo trailer and headed back to Vegas. I did change the oil and checked it over before we left. No trouble at all coming back! I shifted down manually a lot of the time to keep rpm up as with OD off, (it just didn't down shift early enough) and it pulled every mountain pass doing the speed limit with No problems. Need to mention the trailer was loaded to the limits too! What a rig. Two and a half days! I'm fighting blood clots, so we had to stop a lot. Love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck is great. With the right tires its great driving in all weather. Goes through everything with ease. Its the perfect truck for WNY weather. Snow driving couldn't be more fun. Road noise and wind noise are bad but it is a box. Awesome off road truck. Nice cause it can fit in small areas. Real easy to see all the way around the truck. Great breaks. No complaints other than noise and fuel mileage. Its a babe magnet. LOL</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased an X model with the 24S option package that provides better off road capability than the Sahara while giving up very little of the convenience and none of the comfort. I added rock rails to protect the underside of the body's rocker area. Options include the wonderful Freedom top, automatic transmission, Sirius radio, Side air bags and fog lights. Compared to the previous iterations of the Wrangler, the new JK series is vastly better in terms of quiet and ride isolation. If you've own an older Wrangler, you will be astounded at the refinement of the JK inside and out, on road and off road. Fuel mileage around town is 16 mpg, while getting a surprising 25+ mpg highway.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Owning a Wrangler is really a lifestyle. The Wrangler is adaptable to any weather and driving conditions. Go anywhere and have fun doing it. No better power train warranty in the business and a low-cost service contract extends the lifetime coverage to the entire vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>2008 JK is very much improved, from previous models .It rides much better than YJ and TJ's. The only bad thing is you can't reach the back seat.It could use a little more power, but nothing is perfect. I have an X and it's the most affordable SUV on the planet. It also comes with a lifetime warranty, which isn't bad either. No other vehicle can you personalize like a jeep wrangler. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Everyone is complaining about leaks. Well the only leakage is on 4 door, sundowner tops 2 or 4 and hard tops. I bought a 2008 X w/auto, a/c with standard top. No leaks! Only two pain in the behind areas are the weather stripping on top on opposing corners that come flying off, and the front passenger seat that does not slide froward enough to access back seat. Mileage is good,18 around town and 21 hwy. Not a racer, just a regular ole hippie/biker guy. Performance is adequate, ride is comfy and handling is pretty darn good. Turning radius is outstanding. Yes there is some wind noise, but it is a rag top. What other vehicle gives ya'll as much fun, reliability, and enjoyment for 21 grand. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my Mustang convert in order to get back into a Wrangler. This is my third one and they just keep getting better. Sahara has the perfect trim level for cruising. The 18" wheels and Dueler A/T tires can take you anywhere. Plenty of power and acceleration for freeway cruising. The 6-speed shifts so smoothly! No complaints about gas mileage. The trip computer consistently shows I'm getting just over 23 mpg average per tankful (30/70 city/highway). Almost 6000 miles and not a problem. This vehicle gets a lot of looks.

<TEXT>I had a 1997 wrangler soft top w/ a 4 cyl and I loved it. Finally drove it into the ground so I bought a 2008 x. Coming from a 4 cyl to the new v6 I don't have a problem with the power that many ofter people seem to. The 2008 has power everything, 6 speaker stereo system, a 3 piece freedom top. It's a huge step forward over my old Jeep and I love it. The only thing I don't like as much as my old Jeep is the fact that the passenger seat does not roll forward like my old Jeep did which makes it harder to get into the back seat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Alright so my husband talked me into this vehicle and heck it is fun to drive, when it actually works. I have less than 4000 miles and already the jeep has been to the shop 3 times due to all the indicator lights coming on and the gauges not working (speedometer, rpm) while I was driving. Then once you turn the car off, it won't start. I have called the customer service department and they expect you to keep running it back and forth to the shop to get it fixed while you are paying your car note and insurance.I am hoping that this will be resolved but I have to say be weary to those who are interested in this vehicle. anyone else with this issue?</TEXT>

<TEXT>We are a family of five and most people with a penchant for traveling and camping would have opted for a Caravan or SUV offering a little more space. We were being pushed towards a Durango, but insisted that we go with the Jeep. We had a Jeep Cherokee in the past and missed her greatly and with the new four-door option, it was a no brainer. We grabbed the 08 Unlimited Rubicon and we are not sorry. After logging over 23,000 km on our Jeep green machine, we are definitely considering it to be a "Ruby". We travel between Ontario and B.C. through all types of weather and this vehicle has saved our skins countless times. With it's ESP and 4x4 overkill. It is the ultimate family ride!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I compare our Jeep to a '47 cj2a. My first. It meets and exceeds expectations. Bigger gas tank. Built like a tank where it counts. Can go anywhere better than any stock 4x4 except another Jeep. Still looks and acts like a Jeep! Gas mileage around 18 average. Did not buy for economy. My wife bought it for the looks, everything else is gravy. The ride is good on and off road because the weight distribution is almost 50/50. Braking, turning and handling are better than expected. The stereo is awesome. Warranty the best. We paid less than a 1000 for 7year/100k bumper in addition to the lifetime powetrain. Just hope they stay in business before we die! We like our Jeep!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powertrain, looks like a Jeep, fun to drive, will go almost anywhere if you are willing to take the risk. My wife won't let me. Stereo is a unexpected bonus. Room for the grandchildren.

Further, I was worried about fuel consumption; however, this jeep gets better mileage in both city and highway then my Toyota Tacoma, 4x4 TRD. I have a six speed which may negate a lot of the issues surfaced by other owners... The bottom line is that it's an American made vehicle that looks and drives great! </TEXT>

Needs seat pockets, storage compartments lacks. Hit a deer, minor bumper damage, rest of vehicle was undamaged, can't say same about deer. Aftermarket supercharger is now available adding 125 HP...very expensive though. Chrysler, make the 4.7 L or a HEMI option avail! The hard top/soft top combo is very nice feature. passenger rear windows are engineered very well, the Velcro isn't very stable, at highway speeds they separate from the frame. mygig option is dynamite feature.

Pick up is more than adequate(unless you need to drive on the autobahn) I have never driven a more "fun" vehicle. Go with the freedom top not the soft. It's a 4 door, 4 wheel drive go anywhere convertible. I cant say enough. I drove a GMC Envoy for the past 6 years, don't have the bells and whistles I had with the Envoy but I don't need them. MPG at this point has been close to 17 both in town and highway. Straight out high way I got almost 21, its only a day old!

<TEXT>I Just bought the new 08 x Wrangler as well. I've owned previous wranglers, but since they stopped making the Sport, my only option that was similar was the X Model. I must concur with the other person who rated this vehicle. I definitely notice the difference between the 4.0 and 3.8. The Jeep is perfect except for the power! Fuel economy will never be good for a Jeep, but theres a give and take. It is very slow starting out, and the six speed manual forces you to change gears more often, at slower speeds. I do hope they go back to the 4.0 liter, and I'm sure I will upgrade to the newer model if they did this. I wouldn't be able to switch out the motor on my own, because of the warranty</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The new body style is definitely awesome, large tires and ground clearance as well. Additionally the lifetime powertrain warranty is a good thing, because I'm sure that 3.8 wouldn't last a lifetime. This only vehicle that looks better than this jeep is the Rubicon (also 3.8).</FAVORITE>

Not anymore, I am like a dog in the back of a pickup truck now days, smiling the whole time, and I go when I want.

Still surprised by the poor gas mileage but it's improved to about 16 city and 22 highway with 5,000 miles on the odometer. I wanted the shorter model but the unlimited rides better. Back seat entry is best left to the kids. Can't see the wheel flairs so be careful around close quarters. Steering wheel diameter seems larger than what it needs to be.

It's everything and more I ever wanted. Was finally able to fold back the sunrider roof and enjoy driving my baby around town, smiling at everyone who looked, doing the wave to other Jeep owners. Way cool!! I highly recommend to anyone who loves their vehicles and loves to have fun.

<TEXT>My wife and I purchased this four- door Wrangler last Tuesday and immediately took it on a 250 mile round trip and found it to be undoubtedly the BEST Wrangler we've owned yet! It's very comfortable, quiet and even though it has less HP than our previous 4.0's, I haven't found it to be lacking in acceleration. Also, we achieved 23.6 mpg on the interstate. Incredible for a Wrangler, especially for a brand new one. I highly recommend the four-door Wrangler for someone looking for the best and most capable 4X4.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4X4 system...in my opinion the best on the market. 18" wheels...provide a great view from inside. 4- doors...accessing the backseat is much improved over the 2-door variety. Fit & finish is improved over past years.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Starting it up the first time,and driving off was awesome! Turned the first corner and hopped off road! Incredible!! on or ff road. I've owned lots of 4x4's including other jeeps, and this years 2008 jeep Rubicon has them all beat, hands down! If you can afford the Rubicon, get it with some of the new whistles and bells, power windows/locks in a jeep too cool! The new hardtop is a must it provides security, much warmer in the cold months, and best of all it comes apart in 3 pieces! I highly recommend this Jeep Rubicon!! Love the wheels too. All in all its hands down the best jeep I've ever seen, and the best 4x4 I've ever had! Don't forget to wave, It's a jeep thing!!! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power Windows, power locks, alarm, keyless entry, 7 spkr 360 something Watt, 6 disc, dvd, mp3, cdrw, cdr, cd infinity stereo, Cruise control, 32" wheels, soft rider softop that slides back, digital compass and outside temperature displays on the dash, even the cup holders have small rubber grips inside! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Sold my '06 Evolution IX MR for this. Was never an SUV type of guy but this thing is a blast. Gas mileage isn't anything to rave about but it is expected from a car like this. Ride is comfortable, great seats, acceleration is acceptable. Could use about 50 HP more for highway acceleration though. Off road capability is untouchable by anything out there other than a REAL hummer (H1). Haven't tried folding the soft top yet but looking forward to it. Al ot of nice features/options like remote start, SIRIUS, Infiniti system, Hitch, etc. Interior is a great place to be in, seats are firm yet comfortable for long rides. Handles great even with BFG tires. I would highly recommend this to anyone</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Unlockable sway bar, SIRIUS, Infiniti 368W system with Subwoofer has great sound, Soft top, 5 star front impact rating, Removable doors, foldable windshield, Remote start, Full spare, Extremely easy-to-fold rear seats give tons of cargo space, abundance of aftermarket & Mopar accessories</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I worry about driving my kids around in this.. What happens if we rollover? Would we be cut to shreds by a disintegrating hard-top ? Not my first choice. But my kids LOVE it. I like the utilitarian interior. 6- speed transmission is OK and fun to operate. Reasonable acceleration off the line in 1st and 2nd. After that, there is not much get up and go, but I think in this vehicle, too much acceleration would lead to trouble due to the high center of gravity. Riding around town in this is FUN ... Highway driving is a little wobbly. Steering is vague, which IS NOT GOOD. This is the only vehicle that does NOT look like something else, which makes it unique.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Minimum blind spots. Good field of vision. - Manual transmission. - Easy clean interior - Lots of good after market accessories - High driving position - Great looking vehicle. Not your typical SUV.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I haven't driven a jeep in 20 years. The Rubicon has a good comfortable ride, low range no doubt is a true rock crawler, to truly enjoy the vehicle have no less than 5K on the vehicle. Great equipment, Keep in mind the better the equipment the further to get in deep trouble and far away from the nearest towing garage. I was once told that you need to buy an Wrangler X to build it up a true jeep. Don't believe that, there plenty of more building to get the Rubicon where you want it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Standard gears good A/C and heater. More room to store your stuff (just look its there). the hard top is better than the reviews. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our first jeep ever owned! We love it! It was a toss up between a Jeep and a VW Beetle Convertible. No comparison here. My wife feels very safe driving jeep, especially in the snow. Love the Rescue Green Color. Be prepared for people to ask,what is it? Duh... A 4-door Wrangler! Looks like a Hummer. Can't wait till summer and take to the beach!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dual Tops. Get this option nice having hard top during winter and sunrider soft top during summer.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Was a wrangler owner in 1996, had tons of issues but loved to drive it. They fixed everything I hated about the old models. It rides smooth, layout inside and out is perfect. VERY QUIET-- love that. Performance is good, could be a tad better but I am happy with it. Get BETTER gas mileage than my 4cyl 4dr Saturn wagon [seriously]. so far 20-21 mpg with mixed driving and it is very new [500 miles] so mileage will improve with driving. I missed my old jeep for YEARS, used to go to the lot and sigh every time I saw one but a two door was too small for me now-- enter the 4door unlimited!!! Thank you Jeep-- I luv you!</TEXT>

<TEXT>At first things were going well. I have had my Wrangler just under 6 months. and already had an issue. An ice storm hit my house a branch went through the soft top. Next day had a check from the insurance comp. felling pretty good. Took the jeep to the dealership who sold me my jeep they replied no problem we will order one have it here in 2 days. One week later and shipping my jeep 4 counties away still no jeep. The soft tops do not fit. Before the accident great! Do not ever let anything happen to yours because there is no replacement. At this time I am looking to trade it on a truck or some other 4x4. Love 4x4 hate the jeep! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Minimal sound, Large tires good ground clearance, Good looking interior</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We love our new Unlimited X 4 door. It rides nicely. We had a 2001 Wrangler Sport and it rode pretty well but was noisy. This Unlimited X far exceeds my expectations on ride quality and noise. It also has better gas mileage than the smaller Wrangler Sport. We are averaging around 20 mpg so far. It is a great looking vehicle. It has lots of room compared to the Sport. The engine is smooth but could use more power. The freedom top leaks a few drops but I think they fixed that. It is a great Jeep compared to its predecessors. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Solid feel. Fairly quiet ride. Good turning circle for such a big vehicle. Good roominess. Great looks. Great value holder. Great tradition. Beefy build. Can hold its own against all the competition. Decent mileage. Tinted windows. Great front end crash rating.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well after a couple days with the Sahara Unlimited 4wd, I am having a blast. I love the space, I like how high it sits, and having test driven about 6 different Jeeps (my family has also owned about 4 Jeeps in the past 6 years so I am pretty familiar with them) I am pleased with the final choice. I sometimes think the people who come up with the "underpowered" statements are the same people who drive minivans like sports cars. A Jeep is for beating mother nature's collective butt when she throws hard weather at you. Just come here to Vermont, so these "underpowered" people might get it. Put it this way, would you want an xterra pulling ya outta the mud & snow or a Jeep? nuff said! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Space, by far I like the large interior in the back. I fly remote control planes, and this is going to be just perfect for getting to far fields, and high hills.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Hands down best 4x4 i have ever driven. i work in the mountains east of San Diego and i drive it over some really tough terrain (it's my work vehicle). it climbs like crazy and i can go places that the other trucks cannot. we beat em up and drive em hard out here, but this thing is solid. even rides smooth on the highway; it feels more solid and stable than the smaller jeeps. i love this truck. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>climbs like crazy. awesome 4x4 ability, looks great, stereo is excellent. way more room for gear than the other jeeps.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My hinges and black bolts/washers have rusted after 4500 miles. My Jeep is 100% garage kept. My local dealership cannot figure out how to fix and is not willing to. I am very disappointed and frustrated. This should not happen on any new vehicle. I have contacted my local dealer 9 times now without any luck. I have just filed a complaint with Chrysler which I hope will bring results. The workmanship is poor as well as their service apparently. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Wanted a Jeep CJ back in the day, got married and never got one. Now she's gone and I got my Jeep. Most fun I've ever had in a car. 2 weeks ago took it out with the top down for the first time, can't wait for summer. Comfy ride for a Jeep. Handles better than I expected for an SUV, and this is not my first SUV. Gas mileage is about what EPA rating says it is. Looks good outside and in, but interior needs a little work. Odd placement of window cranks and center dash console has too sharp an edge at the drivers knee. Center arm rest could be higher. Seating position and seats are comfortable. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Top down driving with the soft top. Doesn't leak, even in a car wash. Seating position is upright, very nice seats. Fun to drive with manual tranny, always easy to find the right gear. Extremely cool with top off, stand-out vehicle driving down the road. Off road legend is well deserved.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Jeep, although I have owned other 4wd vehicles. This 4 wheel drive system is the best I have had, other have included Ford, Chevy and Toyota. I have the 6 speed manual tranny, I shift quickly and am easy on the gas and average 20.7 MPG (both highway and city). I have the hardtop with the removable sections over the driver and passenger. No leaks after removing them a few times and reinstalling. Open the door in the rain though and you will get a stream of water in the truck as water follows the gap in front and into the vehicle rather than down the glass on a closed front door. Ride is good up front but in the back you sit on the axle making it bumpy. It is what it is. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>You could roast a marshmallow on the heater vents, they crank. Brakes work great, handling is nice. The 4 wheel drive system is the best. </FAVORITE>
