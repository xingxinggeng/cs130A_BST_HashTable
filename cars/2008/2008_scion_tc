<TEXT>I found this car at an absolute steal. My previous vehicle was a '98 Neon and it doesn't even compare to the Scion. It looks fast, although it's admittedly not suppose to be too fast. I found mine used and fully loaded, and for someone wanting a fun, reliable car-- this has suited me well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I Got this car for my daughter because she liked the style and I knew the car was made by Toyota (I am a toyota man). This car is way over priced. The inside is so cheap. Only 22 mpg. I can not believe that Toyota made this car. I might never buy a toyota again because of this experience.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Everything has been very good except for one thing: the automatic 'transmission' on this car is not very dependable. With the car not yet even 2 years, and the transmission is 'kicking forward' while driving at 35-40 mph and when decelerating. Unfortunately, this only one thing happens to be a major component of the vehicle. Difficult to mask my disappointment with Toyota here, and surely will not. Not quite what I bargained for when this vehicle was purchased. It has enjoyed the luxury of oil changes, minor and major services at scheduled intervals and has been taken well care off so I am not sure what to think of this. It only has 42,000 miles. Its going in for a diagnostic tomorrow.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my tC in October of '07, so almost 2 years ago. I traded in my '00 Ford Focus for this and let's just say it was a huge upgrade! I feel so confident when I drive my tC, especially when it's perfect weather to open the sunroof and go cruising with the iPOD on shuffle. It's always fun to play around a little bit and floor it when the light turns green...great acceleration! You get so much for the reasonable, no-haggle price. Love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had this car for 1 year and 7 months so far and have had only one issue. The front left brake caliper seized, but was covered under warranty. Other than that oil changes and weekly gas fill-ups and the car runs perfect. Has a lot of leg room in the back seats, but head room may be cramped for anyone over 6'. Audio system sounds great stock, and the build quality is typical Toyota fashion. Great car to own, usually see 28mpg. I would have kept it longer if I didn't want something faster! lol</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my tC with a super charger so I didn't think that fuel would be that great but I got 27mpg in the winter and get 31mpg in the summer. I have never had a problem with it, that includes having it start outside in - 27degrees with no problem :) The only problem I have come a cross is the vents are hard to direct and the doors don't have a ding gard (now both of my doors have chipped paint) other than that with a sunroof, mp3 wma and ipod ready(w/ cables) radio & kick'n bass, 2.4L S/C engine, and tons of little fitures and millions of after matket accessories ready for you to customize your tC means to me so much. Oh yea and the price is way too low for me to pass up, IT'S A BUY!!!</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>teener loves her tc</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I think that the gas mileage is great. i purchased the car in november of 2007 and it still feels like i am getting into a brand new car. Although leather seat would be nice, they stain very easily and the material is very hard to get anything out. The lighting inside should be all one color and not blue and orange, but thats not that much of a big deal to me. I have a manual transmission and have driven on the highway many times. I think it should have a 6th gear, it always sounds reved out over 80 mph. The exterior of the car is beautiful but, I would not suggest the color white. It gets very dirty and is hard to keep shiny. but over all I love the TC</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The double sun-roof, i-pod hookup, the backseats fold down, first aid kit ( haha) the lights in the cupholder, and also the things i paid extra for including: spoiler, neons, the scion light on the rockerpannel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking for a new car as a graduation present, but I was originally planning on looking at a used 2005 Subaru WRX and 2007 VW GLI, but I decided to stop in at the Toyota dealership on the same strip. I reluctantly test drove the tC, but was really impressed by all the interior features and the price. In the end, I was willing to save a few thousand dollars to get a new rather than used car with a few dozen less horses, but with a lot more interior features, so I bought it the same day as the test drive. Only issue is the stock tires (Yokohama S32's), which are almost $230 each to replace, even though Yokohama has a better performance tire in their own line at a better price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This Scion TC is something else! Great car. We aren't your every day sporty people but hey this car works well, looked good and came at the right price. We simply could not say no. We tried the Fit, Versa, mazda 3 and the civic. The civic rated well too but for the money the TC was a great car. The only thing I find is that for older people it may be difficult to get in and out as the car is low set. I find it difficult but my spouse doesn't. But I'd recommend this car anytime. Most people are unaware that the Scion comes with a Camry engine; as the camry has been around a long time, this can only be a good thing. Our Scion came with a lifetime warranty on the engine and tranny! </TEXT>

<TEXT>After pitching in a few extra bucks for the TRD parts. I'd say it's worth the extra money to upgrade. Acceleration is proportional to the weight of the car. Enough to get up and go but not so much that you cant control the vehicle. This car looks like a $28k vehicle and gets plenty of looks around town. The sound system is very nice for a factory system. You can't beat the reliability on this vehicle. Having said that, the manual transmission seems to feel like it should have one more gear. The fuel economy seems to suffer when driving in traffic. But overall I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a sports car without the outrageous MSRP and insurance costs.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first new car as well. I had 2003 Nissan altima 2.5 L engine with 5 speed. Tho the altima is powerful and has good acceleration, my new scion seems to take off quicker and shifts faster. This is do to the lighter weight car and a 2.4 L engine. Most cars with 2.4 L like Camry weigh much more. Car accelerates very quick with out much effort on the accelerator. Smooth clutch and shifting feels firm. Gas miles is about right and all depends on the driver more then any factor and tire pressure. Hold good con curbs and has more sportier feels suspension as to a corolla or standard Camry. Now I really love my car and Toyota makes the most reliable car </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was going to buy a Mazda3 but the dealer didn't give me enough on my trade in so I went to look at the corolla and I saw the TC and thought it was a 26k car, I had never seen it before or known scion made it, I knew I wanted it right away and bought it the next day. I'm very happy with it but the seats are very uncomfortable, im 6'2. It needs lumbar support. But honestly for 18k you cant get much more with out stealing it. </TEXT>

My old car did get slightly better gas mileage but the tC still does pretty well. The sun/moon room is awesome as is the reclining back seat and the hatch back feature gives me plenty of room in the trunk. It does pretty well in the snow. I am very satisfied and would strongly recommend buying a tC.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After almost two months of ownership, I am definitely glad I got the tC. I used to have a Versa, but it just wasn't the car for me. The tC, though, is. Some people complain about the mileage, but I'm getting mileage comparable to what I got in the Versa. Cornering is a blast, and getting on the highway isn't really a problem. I'm 6' 4", so headroom is a bit tight, but not unbearably so. The ride quality is good for a sport coupe, and the interior is pretty nice; it's well laid out, with all controls easily reachable, and all the gauges are easily read. All in all, for the money, great bang for the buck!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I used to be a VW fanatic but getting into a TC changed the way I look at sport cars. I bought mines used with 18,000 miles. The person that owned the car before must have loved driving it. It came with TRD exhaust and cold air intake. It most certainly changed the feel of the car compared the a stock TC. VERY Sporty, in time this car should catch up like Acura's Integra all it needs is a rear wiper and make it 200 hp stock maybe a 3.2 engine</TEXT>

<TEXT>Was looking for a replacement for my 2003 Celica GT and this was the most appealing and fun choice. Great looking car that handles well and is very comfortable on my long daily commute (115 miles, round trip). Not looking forward to driving it in inclement weather because of the tires, though, but hopefully Toyota/Scion will offer options on future models. But no regrets so far. Very fun car to drive at a very affordable price. A lot of car for not a lot of money and a worthy successor to the decades-old favorite, Celica.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my car in September of '07, and it's now June of '08. Since then I've already put 15,000 miles on it, because no matter where I go, I choose to take my car. It's so fun to drive and not to mention, it's a toyota so it's extremely dependable. I have a manual transmission and for it being a standard it gets pretty good gas mileage (city) and very good gas mileage (highway). </TEXT>

<TEXT>Being close to 60, I felt odd looking at a car that's the favorite of tweakers. I traded in a 2002 Toyota Solara because I wanted better gas mileage and I'd heard that 2008 was the last for the Solara, so it was out. I wanted a coupe, but the Yaris was too small so I looked at the Scion tC. I was surprised to find there wasn't any haggling about the price - what you see is what you get, but the dealer was very generous on my trade-in. I was amazed at the big interior; even bigger than the Solara. I miss the Solara's leather seats and the cushy interior, but the tC is comfortable and the ride is smooth. And I love the upgraded Pioneer sound system! Wish I'd opted for the navigation system.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The panoramic roof, the hatchback (I've got 3 dogs), the acceleration, the heavy-duty A/C, the 17" wheels, headlights and taillights, the sound system set on "Feel," the spoiler, the Sizzling Crimson Mica paint job, the lack of chrome, the cruise control, the outside temperature reading, etc.!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First car to own; one of many cars driven. Value for its price is above outstanding. Looks great, and IS great as the parts are all made with Toyota quality. I drive about 75 miles per day in Houston weather, and do not have much to complain about. The standard tires are a bit below average, (slide during not too aggressive turns). The radio door squeaks (nothing a bit of oil can't fix though). Has projector headlights which is a GREAT plus! The only major problem is the coin/change compartment. DO NOT put pennies or dimes in there! They will fall through the hinge hole and cause the compartment to NOT open up fully anymore! Be caution of this. Otherwise, Great Value Car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Because of reliability issues, I traded a 2000 VW Jetta for this car and have gotten more horsepower, more fuel economy, and next to no maintenance/reliability hassles. It has the look of an expensive infinity or Lexus sports cars. However, despite how the scion brand encourages owners to customize, there is no choice in interior colors and leather upgrades are very limited to seating only. There is lots of road noise and the ride is very firm, but considering this is probably how most sports cars ride I suppose it adds to the feel. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car was my dream car. I now own one beautiful 2008 scion tc and I am proud of it. It has a ton of Nice features that come standard. This car was my first car and I am in high school at the age of 16.This little car is a fast little booger. When you are driving you don't hear the cars when you go past them. It is built on racing suspension and other race car stuff so it drives really smooth and comfortable. The gas mileage on this thing is awesome. My parents surprised me with it one day and I already wanted one so I was very happy. All my friends love it and my younger brothers want it. I am soon getting a spoiler and a Nice catback exhaust and an air intake system on it to make it More fast. Buy one</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>my favorite features are the panoramic sunroof, the 6 inch subwoofer, the upgraded radio that i have, the rims, the speed, the sportiness of it, the new tail lights, the space that you get in a 2 door sort coupe, the hatch that lifts up enough to fit a lot of things in it.i just really love my car!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My tC provides more of a "sport car" feel than many other "sporty" cars competing against it for market share. Cornering is flat and "planted", giving a great sense of confidence and solid feel. The suspension is properly firm...the way a good sports car should be...but still offers a nice, smooth ride quality. Acceleration can be very strong if you stomp the gas, but then you pay for it next time at the gas station. That may be the biggest thing I'd change if I could help design the next tC update...I think the transmission should include one more gear - a good overdrive to improve gas mileage. The tC is small, while its engine has plenty of torque. An overdrive might give well over 30mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first NEW car purchase. I am really impressed. From the audio system, to the comfort, to the steering, it all feels very "sports car." This car is actually replacing the Toyota replacement, the Celica GT-S. Now, it's not as fast as my Celica, but with the 5MT it is very smooth. The light short-shift clutch is very easy (a great car for beginners), and with the 18" Scion Upgraded wheels I put on, the steering is very aggressive. The upgraded Pioneer Audio with iPod is very bass-friendly and sounds really good to my surprise. The interior space was MUCH better than I expected and the reclining second row is very convenient, since hatchbacks are usually cramped. 7 Airbags</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car for a young person. Not a lot of head room so anyone of 6'2 this ain't the car for you. All the available options are awesome and cheap compared to other places. Good handling and well built. The paint is very thin, I would put a coat of wax on the car as soon as I bought it Toyota is famous for thin paint. But this is an awesome car, I would recommend it to anyone. It is an eye catcher on the road and girls love them guys. I would suggest that they add a rear windsheild wiper. I love this car though and I would buy another one tommorow just not in black again. Fun car to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am the type of person who cannot stick w/1 car for very long. I tend to trade in every 6 months to a year. But this car is different. I absolutely love it and have no buyers remorse. I always get looks and comments from people on how much they like it. And it is way affordable for a brand new car and all the things you are getting standard with it. In fact, people think it is a lot more expensive than it really is. With this car you deifintly ride in style and comfort. No blind spots, easy to see. I also have 2 kids who ride in car seats in the back seat daily. Although this is a 2 door I have no inconveinences or space problems. So roomy. I love this car! It's sexy, reliable, and fun!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first new car purchase. After looking for a quality sporty 2-door car. It was a easy decision after comparing the features, quality, performance, and price. Once you add the features the tC has to a car like a Civic, or Tiberon the tC is a much better value. One of the nicest things about buying this car is that the Scion dealerships do not add any unnecessary features, you get to choose was added features when you buy the car. They just give you a well appointed blank canvass to have fun expressing yourself with. My Scion dealership even drove over 300 miles to get the color car I wanted and in a short amount of time. Plus this car looks really cool and is fun to drive.</TEXT>

<FAVORITE>ALL! Especially the gas mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great car for anybody to drive. The styling inside and out is amazing. Scion is made by Toyota so the car is safe and reliable. I'm a college student so it fits me perfectly.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Two moonroofs, styling, fun to drive, hatchback, and a lot of standard features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a great value! It comes with so many standard features for about 5-6 thousand dollars cheaper than similarly equipped vehicles. The big selling point to me is that it's made by Toyota, the interior is practically a perfect design as far as I'm concerned. I had a Honda S2000 before this car and so there's not really many econo sporty cars that could ever live up to that, but I'm so happy I traded vehicles as I now have a comfortable sporty ride that I can actually go to the store and buy groceries in!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the stereo - I'm a bit of an audiophile so it's much better than average, the iPod connection is awesome, and controls on the steering wheel! Dual sunroofs, cruise, low tire gauge, great looks outside, fantastically designed interior, double tiered glove box, folding back seats, QUIET ride!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I chose this car over the honda civic, and mitsubishi lancer. Bottom line: More bang for your buck. It's better built than mitsubishi being thats its a toyota, and more features while being cheaper than the civic. I love the blue ribbon metallic color, and turns heads often. I put the pedestal spoiler and scion license frame on, obx shift knob and racing pedals, and the scion 2 in 1 floor mats. Ample space as well as a very good stock sound system. Plenty of bass, so all I did was put in 6.5" infinty ref. series speakers in the front and back, and it sounds perfect. Good power and handling, with ample room for 5 people, or hauling alot of stuff. I love everything about it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks: big rims, cool tail/headlights, panarama sunroof. Good gas mileage. Kickin sound system. A steal for one of the best built cars around.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Really enjoy interstate off ramps and merging into traffic. The tC looks like a 2 dr but is a hatch back and the seats fold flat which gives me a bunch of room to haul stuff. Fuel enonomy is great around 25-27 city and well over 30 on the highway and I drive 75-80. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Had TRD rear sway bars installed at the dealership, and the handling is fantastic (had them set for street and not track).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only put 5,000 miles on the car. I do 90% highway driving and at 65 mph get 32-34 mpg. It's a good looking car, comfortable, has decent performance with good mileage for performance level. The biggest problem is the paint is thin and gets a lot of chips and this is in summer time driving. I have noted this chip comment from several reviews dating back to the orginal car and would think that Toyota would fix the problem by 2008!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just wanted to say that I just love my 2008 Toyota Scion tC! It's just what I needed! With the capability to upgrade whenever money is in the bank and with tons of parts to choose from I know that I would never be completely satisfied until I deck mine out 120%!!! Thank you Toyota for putting out such a nice vehicle that people like me can be proud of!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the quickness and pride that I get out of my tC. And the fact that I can customize whenever I want to is just awesome to able to just save up money and then blow it on a car that has such great quality as my tC!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great 2 door car for the money. Nice set of features that come standard and vast array of options and TRD performance upgrades. Making this a performance car might not be worth the money, but a few performance tweaks could make an everyday driver happy. I agree with many others that a rear wiper would definitely come in handy. A major problem in customization for tires. 2008 tC comes with Z rated tires! Sounds great if you are taking this thing to the track, but for everyday driving they are completely unnecessary & expensive. There is no downgrade option for all weather tires - big mistake for car buyers who know what they want.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>LED taillight option, fog lights, upgraded sound system, and overall look & performance. A nice practical option is the floor mats with removable carpeting - it makes clean up easier</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this car for one week now, and have driven 500 miles. My first impression: pros: fun to drive, decent stock handling, fairly quick. So many great standard features, things like 2 sunroofs, cruise control, remote unlock. Very impressive stock stereo. Low price tag. Exterior and interior styling. Roomy. Cons: stock tires don't have amazing performance. That's all I can really think of. Overall: you can't beat the features for the price. It's a great car, fun to drive, looks amazing, roomy, comfortable, well built. I don't really have anything bad to say besides the fact that it doesn't come with great tires.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great stereo. Steering wheel stereo controls. Dual sunroof. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I compared similar models in the tC's price range (Mazda3, Honda Civic, Nissan Sentra) and found this to be the best bang for the buck, very well equipped, and lots of room for modifications. Very smooth and quiet ride, could be a bit roomier as I am tall (6'4") but I fit ok. Looks great and overall fit and finish are excellent! Would highly recommend!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned this car for about a week and a half now and I'm pretty satisfied with it. I was told by the selling agent at the dealership that the car goes through tires quickly, which is really its only negative aspect. I was told one set of tires will last about 1 mile/15,000 miles. The car handles decently, with satisfying acceleration. The braking is a tad on the weaker side, probably because the car is 3000 lbs. Also, when taking a sharp turn at higher speeds (around a corner for example) there is considerable body roll. But other than these minor things, the car is great!! Great features for the price, fun to drive, great body styling!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features were the low-profile tires on the 17 inch alloy rims. I also really like the mini subwoofer that is factory installed in the trunk. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall, very good quality for the money. I average 26-29 mpg mixed highway and city driving; if you drive the car like a maniac, your fuel efficiency won't be as good. Interior looks nice, but can tell it's where Toyota performed it's cost-cutting. Sound system is awesome, iPod connectivity is cool (and yes, it does come standard with the port to connect it, contrary to what other people have said). Few rattles here and there, but relatively smooth ride. Could use more HP, but power is very good for 4 cylinder. Head room will definitely be a problem for taller drivers though, but lots of leg room available in back seat. Exterior looks awesome, especially with pedestal spoiler.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is definitely more fun to drive than a Mazda3, Mitsubishi Lancer or Eclipse. It handles great on the highway and on back roads. Brakes are excellent. It really turns people's heads when you pass. It is affordable and with so many factory accessories very easy to customize from the initial purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I would recommend this car - for the money that you pay it's the best. It's not something I would try to make fast, it's a four cylinder. It's reliable and has just enough HP to get it done.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The new Scion tC is awesome! It seems to be very similar to the previous models with the exception of the taillights, headlights, two more standard side curtain airbags, and iPod connectivity. The Scion tC is really fun to drive. I think it's cool that it comes with so many standard features, such as alloy wheels, sun/moonroof, side indicators, six airbags, and immobiliser.The steering is nice and solid like a race car, and I love the rear hatch. I can fit a whole of stuff in that the rear. One problem with the tC is that it seems to rattle a little more than normal if I drive over old pavement. Other than that it's an awesome car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sun/moonroof, immobiliser, exterior design, the fact that headlights turn off by themselves, the lighting of the speedometer, and the hatch.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Excellent car for the money. You simply can not find a car at this price with so many features. The engine is very "torquey" for a 4 cylinder and delivers great acceleration. The number of additions available to this car is also amazing. The gas mileage is good, but isn't outstanding. The new headlights and tailights really made the exterior go from average looking to attractive looking (especially with the pedestal spoiler). The manual transmision shifts very well, just as well as my old prelude. The handling is ok, could be more responsive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After going from my 13 yr old base style Corolla to this standard loaded out car I feel like I've hit the jackpot for a great price. I absolutely love it. It has pep and looks very smart. This is my favorite car I've ever had. Well worth every penny even if you don't add a thing. Feels like I'm gliding on glass it is so smooth. With the Toyota name behind it you can't go wrong. Get one!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Absolutely wonderful car! It has a good deal of power for a 4 cylinder, and despite the mileage ratings I'm averaging 27-28 mpg with mixed city and highway driving. The tC comes loaded from the factory with everything a buyer could want. The upgraded stereo is worth the extra price and sounds awesome (for most users at least). I have no regrets about buying this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's worth every penny, custom it out the way you want. It's designed by Lexus so you know you're getting quality. I get about 22 mpg and I have a 6.5 mile drive to work. I think they could have designed the seats better but that can be fixed with custom leather. But I would have lowered it a little more from the factory. Overall I feel that I made a good decision buying this car. The car is much quieter than I thought but the toyoguard package was well worth the money. Toyota has quality products period.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very impressed with this year's tC. I love the new tail lights and orange illumation in the dash. Rides very smooth and quiet for a sports-like car. The price isn't bad either (for everything that comes standard). Highly recommended to anyone who loves a nice ride with pretty good pick up. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a 2008 Scion tC with fog lights, pedestal spoiler and premium sound system. Overall I am very impressed with its performance. It handles turns very well and has a bite to it when accelerating. The sound system is good and the car is very quiet, and responsive. A couple of things about it though, it has a cigarette lighter built in but no ash tray. It has an auxiliary mode for an iPod but no place to plug an iPod in. These are all optional features I did not get but in hindsight should have. The bucket seats are nice but a little stiff making long rides a bit tiring, and the back window provides a couple of blind spots but overall the car is very fun to drive.</TEXT>
