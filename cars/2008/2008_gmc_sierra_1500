<TEXT>To JUNK!!!! Too many problems with check engine light coming on constantly. For some reason, the gas cap constantly comes loose. GM should provide better stock tires. Had a flat from a piece of limestone gravel. Dealer told me I should drive on better roads! (It's a truck, isn't it?) Should have stayed with Ford. Big mistake to buy this truck. Dealer isn't interested in helping very often. It takes multiple visits to fix one problem. Maybe if the service manager got off his lazy a** of his chair, it could be fixed. Last GM product EVER! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Immediately drove 2 WD truck (17" tires) to central OH from central FL - 20.2 mpg @ cruise set mostly 75 mph. Returned to FL w/bass boat in tow 15-17 mpg. Ride is super w/effortless handling. Plenty of power with 5.3 engine. I wanted a truck with car type ride. That's why I got 2 WD with 17" rims. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck replaced my 2001 GMC Sierra 4wd with the 5.3 motor. The throttle response on the 4.8 motor is pathetic. The traction control is overly sensitive, and the truck jumps out of passing gear too soon. The truck is comfortable, quiet, and handles well. The brakes are a major improvement over my previous 2001 Sierra. I love the lighter weight of the tail-gate.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought pickup through GM Employee Pricing sale and got very good deal. Not quite sure about pickup, as you can feel the 4 and 8 cylinder activating and de-activating. I have experienced the tranny jerk from a complete stop as well. After changing oil I can smell oil in the cabin for at least the first 1,500 miles before going away, cannot find any leaks anywhere.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned truck for almost 600 miles and really enjoy the truck. It has 5.3 V8 with the Flex Fuel Management. City driving is ok, highway is a lot better. For a base model, it came fully loaded with all power options, CD, cruise, fog lights, chrome bumpers, towing package, XM, and OnStar (which I think XM and OnStar were standard). Truck can ride rough over unkept streets, but still a lot better than my old Chevrolet Tracker. Air and heat are great. Can't wait to try the 4x4!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM and OnStar. As weird as this sounds, truck has vinyl flooring which I love! Lot easier to clean than carpet. Also love that Candy Apple Red color!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Nice truck. However, the transmission shifts hard and catches when leaving from complete stop. Dealer says they have had other customers with same problem and no fix for it, so very disappointed. Was in shop at 2000 miles with this problem and still does it. I looked at Fords and Toyota, quality was better. Why did I buy GM? I liked my selling dealer. I'm stuck with this truck that has a catch when leaving from a complete stop. Think twice before purchasing. I do enjoy the truck and if they find a fix for it I'll be happy, but they may be bankrupt first. Till they get their act together, go with Toyota. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th GMC extended cab and my 2nd z71 SLT. Trade my 04 for the 08 because of the great deals over the summer. I loved my 04 but the 08 is hands down a better overall truck. Adjustable everything for the driver including gas/brake pedal. Heated seats, great sound system, upgraded leather seats overall nicer inside. Like the return of drum brakes in the back and nice wheels. EZ lift tailgate is a godsend. Can be open/closed with one hand. Better heater then the 04 but still slow to warm in stop/go traffic on cold mornings below 20 degrees. Remote start is great, ride is great, looks are good, & no more touchy ABS system. 17" Wrangle ATS much better than cheap Bridgestones.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cabin comfort, tires, ez lift tailgate, sound system, power and ride. Towing - Don't even feel the boat back there. Great off road in mud thanks to tires and locking differential. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second GMC. I recently traded up from a 2006. Good ride and handling, Like the appearance, gets the same mileage as my 06, averages 18 mpg. I have cloth interior, I liked the old cloth material better. Radio controls are hard to reach. I like the new dual zone controls. The backup sensor is a joke, some of the gauges are blocked by the steering wheel, I really like the new head lights the low beams stay on with the high Beam. Fog lights are cheap. the interior quality is better than my 06 </TEXT>

<TEXT>I sold a 95 3/4 ton and bought this 1500 series Sierra. I was somewhat concerned about this 1/2 ton pulling my 16ft trailer and, compact farm tractor. Wow, I am so very pleased with the way the Sierra handles this task. This truck has been impressive in every way.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 5.3 engine is very powerful. The limited slip differential is a must have for my application. The interior is huge and everything on the instrument panel is well though out. I really like the XM radio too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love everything about this truck, except for the upholstery. The charcoal colored cloth picks up lint, dog hair, everything and it's quite visible. But what's worse, the nap on the upholstery is starting to flake off with only 14K miles! Quite honestly, if I had realized what a tremendous vehicle this was in every other way, I would have gone with the SLT or Denali trim, had leather and not have the upholstery issue. This is a keeper -- guess I will be looking for an upholstery shop.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have loved Chevrolets and GMCs for 30 years. My 03 Chevy Silverado was the best truck I have ever had. The 08 GMC has been the most disappointing truck I have ever purchased. I am constantly getting alarms that include: Park assist off, air bag, low tires when they are not. On top of the alarms that the dealer cannot fix I have had two interior fans replaced and they are rattling again. The motor is tapping even though I do the recommended everything. The ABS brakes act like I am on ice on dry road. Cheaper braking system. Already have warped discs. My o3 brakes went 144K miles. The sun visors are not wide enough to block the sun. Cannot handle the same trailer as the 03. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck replaced a V6 GMC I had for 17yrs. The power of the V8 is wonderful for a 4.8L and half the price of the 5.3L The truck handles great. It sits higher than my old truck so is a little harder to get into (I'm 6ft) so I installed nerf bars. Everything about the truck is high quality. Lots of cab storage, cup holders. The stereo is quite good for factory installed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the styling. I got the chrome package and Steel Gray Metallic. The seats are very comfortable. Vynl floor covering. Overall I love this truck. At $17,000 the price was great too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>No way this truck has 403hp. Had two different 06 Titan trucks that would leave this thing in the dust. Also, the Titans would out tow the Denali. The Bose radio system is whimmpy compared to other trucks and cars I have owned. Handling is so-so. No standard step rails or sprayed in bed liner. Come on GMC this is your top of the line? Get real. I guess this will be the last GMC I will buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Gas mleage is remarkable for a large truck with the 5.3 l engine. I typically average 18.9 combined driving and 20.2 on long interstate trips and have measured it numerous times. I test drove all the trucks on the market and this is hands down he best on the market. The quietness, comfort, handling, audio system is just simply the best on the market. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had this truck for a month and all I want to do is drive it. It rides and drives much better than my 05 did. (though I was happy with that truck as well) The controls are well laid out and easy to reach. There is planty of interrior storage. As for all you cry babies about gas mileage, what do you expect from a 5000lb truck with a 315hp V8? I am pretty much getting what the sticker claims. (14/19) If you are that concerned about gas mileage I recomend the Malibu. If you want a great truck then buy a Sierra.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first new truck. I traded up from an '03 Malibu. I gotta say, if that car handled like this truck does I'd still have it! It's like floating over country roads compaired to riding in a friends '08 Ram. But, you still get a solid amount of "feedback" (Enough to keep you interested in driving.) It's solidly manufactured, and gorgeous on the inside! My only complaints are 1) $800 extra if you get the DIC included? 2) Still no cabin air filter... maybe by 2010 and 3) Itty bitty headlamp bulbs...don't get me started on the factory Fog-lamps</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar is nice and all, but I think my favorite "feature" would be the decreased gaps in the bodylines. Especially the gap between the bed and the cab</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Last truck was a '96 Z71 ext cab Chevy. This truck is awesome! I love 99% of it! I chose this, over the somewhat cheaper Silverado, due to the way the dealer treated me and the price they quoted me. No one else could come close to my deal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride is top notch. The overall quality of the vehicle is noticeable from the word go. Gas mileage is very good considering the weight and 4wd. I think my next truck will be a GMC as well if they keep up the great work!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've always been a General Motors man since I can remember being allowed to drive the neighborhood mechanics' '65 Fleetwood Brougham de'Elegance. Man that was sweet. Owned nothing but Cadi' since '77. Been wanting a truck for the last 10 yrs. Researched Ford, Toyota, Nissan, Chevy, and GMC, of course GMC won me over. I love this truck. Just in hindsight, wish I'd gotten the catback system with duals, chrome grille, the tonneau cover and 20s". Owned since Valentines day, 7,000 miles later, several trips to Memphis, one to Tupelo, I can't even complain about the gas mileage (great for a truck), flex fuel management is great. Thanks GMC you hit this one out of the park.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the ride, comfortable for long distances, the look (it's cute)it's an eye catcher, my choices in changing the single disc to 6, cloth to leather, and the color, Crismon Metalic, or as I call it Black Cherry</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Active fuel management is a little disappointing. I thought I would get higher gas mileage. I get higher gas mileage with my 2001 5.3l GMC. It could be GMC's choice of tires. I do like the truck's ride and interior comfort. The cup holder and glove box need work. The owners manual barely even fits in the glove box. All in all it is an 8.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MP3 player 6 disc, rear seperate audio controls for radio and Ipod plug are awesome. Bose premium sound is also very nice. Backup asisst rear drum brakes. The rear disk I had on my 2001 were costly. Automatic mirror collapse button is nice when your wife is trying to put the truck in the garage</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have built quite a few cars and trucks over the years, this by far out performs them in an all around sense. I got a pretty basic truck for my buisness so that's why comfort is a marked low. My only complaints are that I didn't go bigger with an extended or crew cab, and we need the 6 speed in the basic trucks too. The motor is the most impressive part of this truck. I have a tool box and tonneau, and now acheive up to 22 mpg. The six speed wouldn't work here. My friends Scion TC only get 25-27 mpg average so I'm very very happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck drives great! I have an 03 Yukon that gets about the same mileage without cutting 4 cylinders off so that doesn't seem to be worth much. It has developed a squeak in the front end the past few days like a dry ball joint but the dealership isn't open on the weekend so I will get it there Monday, pretty annoying for a truck with 3000 miles. I have always loved GMC'S so I love this one too, it looks great and other than the squeak has been great. There is a lot of air noise from the doors that is annoying with the radio off. There are plenty of power ports for devices in the front and back and even one in the console! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear extended cab doors open all the way open to the side of the truck and rear windows roll down which is really nice. The All Terrain package I got has 18" chrome wheels that look awesome and many people have commented on them, it also has a chrome grille. Love the XM radio. Four wheel drive!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have never owned a truck before, but I will be moving my son to college and am planning some large home renovations. I bought this truck because dealers are making incredible deals on full-size trucks. A 2.5 ton vehicle with a 315hp engine that gets 15mpg around town is not bad in my opinion. Mine is a 4x2 because I am always on asphalt and it rarely snows in SE Virginia. One tip: Stabilitrak comes with traction control. So consider this option with a 2WD if you want a lower sticker and really don't want/need the extra maintenance and fuel comsumption of a 4WD. This vehicle handles well and is smooth and quiet. It reminds me of a 1977 Lincoln Town Car, only it handles much better.</TEXT>

Black it out completely, changed door handles to black got rid of chrome strip, added OMEX 6000K halogen kit, got rid of the orange on front head light assembly, changed tailpipe all black 5" oval, sits on 26" black rims, with a lowered supension kit 2"f 5"b, looks mighty damm good!

<TEXT>Very impressed with this vehicle. Sold my 175K mile Sierra and due to its excellent performance, I'm sold on GMC. The Denali drives and handles great. 18mpg hwy and 16.4 in town. Not bad for a 6.2 ltr V8. My previous 4.8 ltr V8 only beat that by 1mpg! My vehicle came loaded w/options and couldn't pass it up for $38.5K. With gas prices I think they are really having to come down on these things. Very quiet ride on the highway and around town. It does need more storage compartments/center console organizer. I would rather the center console open from the side rather than front. It's somewhat awkward and has a rather flimsy spring hinge.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Coming from a Honda Civic the Sierra 1500 feels like a monster. What a dream to drive. I actually enjoy driving to work now. One of the first things I noticed was how quiet the ride is. With the windows up road noise is virtually none existent. I've been getting around 16.6mpg with all around driving. I suspect that will go up as the motor breaks in, but hey if you're looking for fuel economy buy a prius and just hope that someone in a 1500 doesn't hit you. I highly recommend getting the remote start option. I always start the truck a few minutes before I leave and it either turns on the heater or AC depending on the inside temp of the truck. Nothing like hoping into the perfect climate. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The remote start is a most have. The leather seats are really nice and the 170 degree swing of the rear doors is key. Also having rear windows that roll down is nice.</FAVORITE>

The truck had vibrations in the front and passenger door. 3 trips and 14 days in the dealership did not solve the problem. My personal mechanic said the problem was in the powertrain.

<TEXT>I decided to buy a new truck and chose the new body GMC for several reasons. The overall design is great! The interior is nicer than ever and everything is within easy reach. The big bold grille stands out in a crowd.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The stereo with XM radio built in is great. Great turning radius. Plenty of power and the gas mileage is great! The new rack and pinion steering is a bit touchy, but handles great. You can feel confident when stopping. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Love this truck</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have had this truck for 2,000 miles and about 6 weeks with no problems at all. The truck is solid and fun to drive. I love the exterior design. It looks rugged. I replaced my 1995 Dodge Dakota to get a real truck. I am extremely happy with my decision.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior look and solidness, especially over train tracks. I have no rattles at all. The interior is well designed also. I love the back doors that open 170 degrees and the ease that the back seats fold up. I am very satisfied with the engine performance, very smooth running with a lot of pep.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The truck is solid and fun to drive. I went from a Dodge Dakota which I loved, but this is a real truck compared to the 1995 Dakota. Very rugged looking interior that should look good for years. The handling is excellent and it takes train tracks much better then any other vehicle I have been in. I have 1600 miles on it and have not one issue with the truck to date. I have received several compliments about my truck and I love teh new Stealth Gray color that I chose. The 170 degrees that the back doors open is extremely handy. Mileage is a little dissappointing to date at 15.1, but that is with only winter weather.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After reading reviews about almost all possible kinds of trucks I decided on my Denali. Have had it for several days and this truck delivers. Interior is down to smallest detail without any fault, my truck actually looks better than the LandCruiser 200 having classical and delicate finish. Exterior is also great, kind a smart how low the truck looks giving the feeling of real street machine. It of course performs as a truck, no mistake there, but it's a looker. PS. Did I mention its screamingly powerful?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hmmm, the sound system, the transmission, the quality of workmanship, the power, the smoothness and the almost royal chrome finish all around the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have driven GMC trucks for several decades, this is quite possibly the best I have ever owned. Quiet ride, strong frame, good power and torque, no cheap interior like Toyota. Best looking truck on the market. I drive over railroad tracks every day, completely unnoticeable in this truck. Love the OnStar and XM radio features. Lots of interior room as I am a large person, yet fit comfortably inside</TEXT>

<TEXT>Before purchasing this vehicle I researched everything about it to the inth degree. I ended up trying to decide b/t the 08 Tundra and the 08 Sierra. I test drove the Tundra and liked it, immediatly following I went and test drove the Sierra and fell in love. MPG is as advertised. I can feel the v8 switch to 4cyl but no one else in the veh can, not a bid geal. My 2 dislikes: the brakes and transmission. Simply put, replace the rear drums with the Tundra's disc brakes and replace the 4 speed tranny with a 5 or 6 speed and you have the perfect truck! The 5.3 (w the 4 speed) feels less beefy than you would expect. All in all, I am extremely pleased. I am now a GM man for life.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The comfortable ride is #1. Remote start, solid quiet ride, MPG (Active Fuel Mgt), auto lights, stereo controls, wide stance, roomy comfortable interior. Of course the exterior. I could go on...</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been looking at buying a new truck for a while and the Sierra Denali is by far the best bang for the buck, that is if you can afford it. The truck has the best ride and handling of any truck I have ever driven. Gas mileage is not to great, so far I have average 15 mpg in the city and I got up to 22 mpg on the highway, but that is not to bad considering you have 403 HP on tap. The truck has excellent fit and finish and the exhaust note is very nice. If you pay sticker for this truck you will be paying way too much, I managed the get the 2WD model with the upgraded 20" chrome wheels for $35,900 (retailed for a little over 42). Bottom line, a great truck for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Remote start, bose sound system, 403 HP, power folding mirrors with tilt- down, the leather seats are very comfortable, the overall appearance of the truck (hands down the best looking factory truck, turns a lot of heads), heated windshield washer fluid when ice covers your winshield, smooth ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've been driving my Denali for about 3000 miles so far. It's an allover amazing vehicle. I haven't been able to find any faults whatsoever with the exception of the power being too tempting.... I'm going through the gas a bit faster than I'd like because it's too easy to hit the pedal. I give GMC full marks on this truck, it's got to be the best truck on the market right now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>GMC really did a great job with this truck. I really love the power of the engine and the comfort. I do not drive it much trying to keep those miles off of it. But when I do it is a treat and makes me appreciate life more. It definitely is deserving of much kudos. Thanks again GMC for a really great vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always been a Chevy man, really needed a new pickup so I went with the GMC. I wanted the 5.3l because it does great in my 01 Suburban. My New 5.3, which has fuel management gets much worse mileage. I get 13.5 MPG at any speed or condition driving, even downhill. Also the 4 sp transmission is clunky, brakes are sticky, interior clothe is Horrible, interior plastic comes apart, body has many mud pockets which will rot the metal and the front tire sprays road wash Into the frame by the front door. I am NOT happy with this truck which now has 3500 miles on it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just over 1 week of ownership and I can say I am very pleased with the vehicle. Traded in my Titan LE for this. Interior fit, finish and textures is by far the best I've seen on any truck. Flip up seats in the rear are nice and a necessity (Tundra I test drove didn't have that). Bose stereo is good and Nav seems easy to operate. Not quite as fun to drive as my Titan was, but still decent. Nice rumble from the stock exhaust. 6 speed tranny is smoooooth. Nice and quiet at 60mph. The AWD is a nice feature to have.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The absolute best truck on the market! Had my Sierra w/ All Terrain package for three weeks and at just under 3k miles, I couldn't be happier. Rides like a luxury car on the highway and an off-roader when needed. All Terrain package runs just under Denali as far as price but maintains more of the off- roader feel. Z71 package w/ 20" chrome wheels, 5.3 liter V8, 2-tone leather seating, & much more. I am getting 20 to 21 mpg on hwy & 17 city! Not bad for a larger V8 that really isn't meant for fuel effiency. Overall, best truck on the market after extensive checking and I couldn't be happier. If you are looking for a real deal with a great feel do not stop short of at least drinving one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Remote start, rear parking assist, heated seats w/ memory, rain sensitive wipers, on board computer interface, remote folding mirrors, Z71 package. Smooth, solid handling in all driving situations, folding rear seating w/ high quality leather amenities, 8 cup holders, 4 power outlets, & so much more!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I decided to replace my SUV with a full-size truck. Choice came down to an '08 Sierra SLT vs. an '07 Tundra Limited ('08 Tundra priced way out of my budget) because I've always bought Japanese. Tundra has nice powertrain but falls short in every other category, especially it's bloated price. GMC SLT's greatest selling point is its luxury grade interior. Tundra is very weak here. GMC's shift at any speed automatic 4x4 is far better than Tundra's crude hi/lo 4x4. GMC has better crash test scores than the Tundra. This is the 1st full-size truck I've ever owned but driving it is actually a joy. Parking is a learning experience but the parking assist makes it doable even for a newbie like myself.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>10-way heated leather driver/passenger seats, rear parking assist, OnStar, automatic 4x4 mode, command center, MP3 input, rear doors open 170 degrees, adjustable gas pedal, automatic lights, remote start (heats seats), heated washer fluid, smooth ride/powertrain, EZ-lift tailgate, classic good looks</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted a stylish "basic" regular cab truck. I looked for a comparably equipped Tundra but there were few choices out there...with only leftover '07 models, almost all of them long-bed and white! And none of the base model Toyotas had factory XM radio. So I purchased the Work Truck package Sierra... and I'm very pleased. The dash design, controls, seats, driving position, and interior storage all work very well for my tastes. The cargo management system is very usefeul as well. And the 4.8 V8 has a satisfying exhaust rumble. I drive alot in the bumpy inner-city Houston streets, and this truck hamdles it well. This was a good choice, and I beleive it will serve me well.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Best One Yet</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>After driving GMC trucks since 1974 this new 2008 Sierra is the best one yet. The interior is outstanding with great back support in the bucket seats; easy accesss to everything on the dash; to great controls on the steering whell. This is the first time for GMC to have cruise control on the steering wheel and it is much easier to operate. Performance is outstanding with the 5.3 engine and my gas mileage is good as well. With the 4-6-8 engine I get 24 to 25 mile to the gallon at 55 mph. Amazing! My friends drive Fords and Dodges and their milage is so bad 10-12 mile per gallon. Too bad they didn't buy a GMC. My company truck is a Ford 4x4 and on a good day it gets 12-13. Really sad. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only driven this truck for a week now, but I love it more than any other car I have every touched. The gas mileage is better than advertised, it does very well in the snow and on icy roads. It looks better than the pictures. It handles like a car on the road and a truck off the road. Perfect for any situation. Lots of room in the crew cab, and the bed, although short, is still long enough for most items. I really love this truck!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went into the truck market expecting to buy a Tundra because I have had such good luck with Toyotas.To say that I was pleasantly surprised with the Sierra is an understatement. I priced a loaded SLT with the 6 liter engine and the Denali was about the same price. It was an easy decision to buy the Denali because of the extas like the 6.2 liter motor and six speed tranny to mention a few. This truck will run with the Tundra, rides better, handles better and has a more refined interior. My wife prefers the Denali over her Acura RL, which she loves. My freinds can not believe the power with the engine and tranny combination. Do yourself a favor and test drive a Denali when looking for a new truck!</TEXT>

<TEXT>A family member bought the Tundra in Oct.'07-Toyota is making a big deal out of their 5.7L engine etc...the Tundra is a nice truck--but I decided to go with the Sierra for several reasons: Better road manners--especially on the freeway--very tight steering. Much more luxurious, refined and thought-ought interior. Everything inside is beautiful and solid--not an easy feat to accomplish. Classic looks--yet modern. GM really hit a home run with this design. I get more looks and questions than when I had a Porche. Perfect size Crew-cab. This is the biggest downer with Tundra--you either get the smaller ex-cab or the huge double--bigger than Dodge's. Bad combo. GM hands down!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The stereo is very nice, Remote start is a most if you park your truck outdoors as I do. Stereo controls on steering wheel. Supple leather seats. Perfect height and great visibility from and to all angles. The ride is smooth, yet it never stops being a truck. Denali grille option. Individual air</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my Black/black 08 Sierra Denali for about 2 months now. Amazing power. Amazing comfort.. Amazing headturner. A beautiful ride in every way. The MPG of 11-12 in the city is a bit of a nuisance but if you spend $42K for a truck you better not whine about the cost of fuel!! If you have the means you should buy this truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought this incredible machine. I bought it for the engine even though gas prices are high. It gets decent mileage for its powerhouse 403hp 6.2 liter engine. Best stock V8 horsepower of any brand and you still can chip it to 500hp +. The interior is refined and classy. It looks like my BMW 5 series inside. You can buy a regular fully loaded 4X4 crew and pay the same price. I feel this is the best deal in luxury trucks.approx. 40-45k depending on options. The cadillac escalade has become synonomous with bling bling and hip hop.- it is a little to showy for me. This Denali is not so showy and has a beautiful interior. So far no problems as I am babying it until 1000 miles. Super quality.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Remote start from max 200 ft. electronic control folding rear view mirrors. heated seats, 10 position seat control, surround sound. Nav is good but I rarely use it.

<TEXT>Very nice truck, great build quality. Unlike an ealier review that states the stereo is great, in my opinion the Bose system is a huge disapointment. The Factoy Nav system is great, but the speakers and center dash speaker is terrible. Why GM would even waist the money advertising it is a Bose system is beyond me. For a $45K truck, I would expect a better sounding stereo system. Gas milage is adverage, but you dont buy this truck for fuel milage. Ineterior quality is very nice. Wish GN had a 6' bed option with this truck, 5'8" bed is a lottle small. Looked at the new Toyota and F150 and I an glad I bought the Denali!</TEXT>

<TEXT>With only 5 weeks and 1,200 miles of ownership my new 2008 GMC Sierra Denali has so far been flawless. I have owned Ford, Chevy and Dodge and this is by far the best of the bunch. Fit and finish is exceptional (for a truck or car), for a truck it has a smooth ride, great power and exhaust note, seamless 6 speed automatic transmission and great interior and exterior styling. It is like driving a full sized luxury SUV with a pick-up truck bed in the back. I couldn?t give 14-16 mpg a 10, but that?s not bad for having 403 hp on tap.</TEXT>
