<TEXT>We have taken two trips with this van and love it. The room is great especially considering we have a 6 month old. Miss my controls on the steering wheel and my auto headlights that my other car had, but I am getting used to the lack of these features. Gas mileage could be better. Wish we could have afforded the upgraded model, but love van overall. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety features were a huge plus for us, all the extra room is great, fun to drive overall love it</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my entourage 6 months ago, limited. it is the best part of our trip, everyone is comfortable, room for things cups you name it. the trunk always has space to spare, not mentioning the center area in the rear, the side space between the seats and the door is grand. and the dvd system blows me away. besides it has inputs for consoles or anything else. it is by far the most quiet, stable, economic, fun to ride and drive and powerful (consider the engine size) car that I have ever ridden. I cant wait to take another trip. and for everyday use in the city. economy is better than the competition.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>everything. specially cargo room and the dvd and sunroof</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So after almost 5 months of ownership, I can say that I am truly impressed with the Entourage. All the forum complaints on the power doors, wheel vibration, battery drain, and gas mileage have not been part of my experience. They van has been flawless since day one, except for a crooked Entourage emblem and broken conversation mirror, both of which were fixed under warranty. If they still made the Entourage, I would be recommending it to everyone. I guess the Kia Sedona is the equivalent, but from what I've read, the Entourage is a little bit more upscale, although at a slight increase in cost. If you can still find one, I bet you can get a great deal on this great minivan.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's unique considering that when we go out, we will see dozens of Odysseys, Siennas, and Dodge/Chryslers. Powerful, smooth, quiet, and comfortable. Tilting side mirrors when reversing. Power rear popout rear windows. Impressive 13 speaker Infinity 660W sound system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle in March of 2009 and in the first two weeks I noticed a discoloring in the headlight lens which I was told would not be replaced under the warranty and now I am sitting at two month mark and I am having problems with my driver's seat rocking and popping and now I am being told that yjis also will not be a warranty repair. I will never buy another Hyundai again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have taken my van on two long distance trip, I am very satisfied. The comfort and handling is very good. Fun to drive...trip computer rear sensors great features...I wish I would of upgraded to receive the power gate. The back do not always close properly when loaded.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the convenience of the stowing away of the back seats. Managing the controls in the steering column and the compass is a plus. The sound system is a plus, the surround sound is great. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have had our Entourage for over a year, and have been overall happy with our van. As a family with 5 children, we give two thumbs up for spaciousness and being comfortable. I love the deep well in the rear for grocery shopping day. The two side auto doors are so helpful! I have found the gas mileage to be horrible at 17 mpg on the hywy. Also, I do not like that every time I fill up the van with gas....without warning, when it is full, gas spews out! I have to be careful. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>side auto doors, space, comfort, the fold down mirror that lets me keep an eye on whats going on in the back! the way the seats come out and fold down to make room for hauling different items. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Good looking exterior and excellent mileage. 14~16 mpg in city, 26~30 mpg on Hwy. Detaching middle seats is not easy but it give me very spacious cabin, very useful for loading so many things like sofa. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>good mileage and exterior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my Hyundai van 2 months ago and have been very happy with the way it drives. It is very comfortable inside as well. I love the automatic side doors and the automatic back hatch door. It has a very smooth ride and great pick-up-and-go. But, the gas mileage is terrible. I expected to get at least 15mpg as advertised, but I only get at best 12.5mpg around town. Apparently that is what most owners are learning. Overall I am extremely satisfied with the Entourage. I hope Hyundai is able to improve the gas mileage in the future.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Large front windshield. Automatic doors. Windows that roll down on side doors. Smooth ride. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased our 2008 Entourage a few weeks ago and love it! The ride is smooth and the space inside is roomy.Hyundai seems like there heading in the right direction, the only downside is the fuel mileage. But were very happy and would definitely recommend it before 34k Honda Odyssey!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Entire minivan is enjoyable ride and it has great pick up from 0-60 mph.For the price you can't get a better minivan!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall we have found the van acceptable. Having traded a Pontiac ssei sedan for the van beacuse of medical reasons we've found many of the amenities of the sedan lacking in the van and not available as an option. However, for the task of carrying medical equipment it is acceptable. The large amount of room is pleasing. Gas mileage isn't great, especially for a 250 hp engine. The sedan got 19 mpg in town, 23 mpg on the highway and was a 3.8l, turbocharged 276 hp engine. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Automatic doors Power outlets Luggage rack Ease of access and egress</FAVORITE>
