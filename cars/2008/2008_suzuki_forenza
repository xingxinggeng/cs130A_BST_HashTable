<TEXT>I just totaled my car Sunday night and it held up very well I flipped it twice and none of the air bags went off, im okay though. But I was very surprised at how well it held up with some of the thing I found out why the price was so low and they just kinda found the cheep way out. But I was very surprised. But I would never buy another Suzuki car </TEXT>

<TEXT>Poor fuel milage for a car this size. Inherrant problems with tire wear and admitted problems with head gasket (loosing coolant)as pointed out by an authorized Suzuki service dept.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our Suzuki was totaled out after an older Ford Explored hit the driver side on March 19th of this year. None of the airbags deployed. I loved my car. I doubt I will ever buy another just for that fact. A co-worker has an 07 Forenza...was hit by a deer...twice, within a a few months of each other. Practically the same spot on car, and location within her community; and neither time did the airbags deploy. How can you trust a car that isn't protecting you?!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I loved everything about it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought this for my wife, after looking at numerous cars and sitting behind the wheel, she like this the best. She was happy with the styling, performance and handling. No other manufactor could come near the price and the warranty is great. I have owned Suzukis' before and I'm very happy with their reliabilty. She wanted the sunfoof model but they were sold out. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, reliable, great standard equipment.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have purchased a Suzuki product once before and was please with the quality and performance. I was looking for a car for my daughter and found the Forenza, its quality and performance match that of the previous 1995 Esteem. Suzuki has one of the best car warranties around.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling is better than average, lots of amenities for a low priced car. This car had power everything.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Hey, this is my first foreign car. I was drawn in to the show room for the price advertised. I traded in a 2004 pontiac sunfire. I can tell you, after driving a mitsibishi at work, american cars stink. This car is alot like the mit,and I really like it. The gas milage is fine, pleny of room in car and trunk, rides smooth, I have no problem at all with the acceleration. Not used to the zig zag on the stick, but Im ok with it now.Great lights inside, no way to lock yourself out,latch for gas cap,soft interior,MP3 is great,stereo sounds awesome,did not like the 100.00 for mats,tight over bumps, would have liked nicer rims, power windows are super fast, has the lock for window control,heated mirrors</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got hit by a person driving a Chev Tahoe on my passenger side and got pushed into the highway concrete barrier. I got some stiches, cuts and bruises. Had to be cut out of car with the jaws of life. Interesting thing and concern was that none of the front airbags or seat side airbags deployed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a black metallic Forenza until someone ran a red light hitting me on the passenger side of my car causing me to become airborne and going under the wheel of an F 250. All that and I walked away without any injuries. Plus the driver airbag did not deploy and i am still having questions about that. After all that I am still going to buy another Suzuki because my Forenza never put me down.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The only thing I really liked about my Forenza was the performance. It was slow to respond but when it did you were out of sight. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The acceleration on this is terrible. The seats feel like you're sitting on a rock. The gas mileage is OK and that's being nice. I guess I just expected more out of this car considering I'm paying $455 a month for it and there's no cruise control. Even my 1993 Chevy S10 had cruise control.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really can't say anything bad. One of the sharpest cars you can buy for the money. This car comes with great base model features and is much more solid than econo-cars before it. You don't buy these cars for sheer performance and gas prices should make the driver focus on doing his part, not just the car. With the money you save invest in a $99 mod-chip for even better mpg & hp. The mpg lives up to it's window-sticker quote which is more than a lot of cars can say! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style. Lumbar support. MP3 input. Price. Size. And the brights are fantastic!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have just the basic model of the Forenza, but if you would just look at it you would not be able to tell. My car has chrome wheels on it and the rear spoiler. If you have a Forenza add the spoiler it will make your car look even better. I love my Forenza(Lucy), but having a car like mine you will get a lot of people who are hate on it. My car handles very well in heavy rain (change out the wipers and get the new air dynamic ones they work way better than the ones that come on the car). Why go get a basic Toyota or Honda with crank down windows when you can get a Forenza for about the same price and get all power stuff.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I thought this car would be good on gas and boy was I wrong! The dealership said it would get better the more I drive it, but who wants to drive more than they have to with the price of gas as it is. I get about 325 to 360 miles per tankful, which averages about 25 to 28 mpg. I have the standard and when it is in 5th gear it sounds like it is going to take off. I think there should be an overdrive or sixth gear.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car is comfortable and fun to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has been dependable since I got it, of course it only had 6 miles and was new. I don't like the slow acceleration, and rough handling on bumps. I think the car gets good speed once it is pushed and broken in. The gas does not justice, I had way better usage in my V6 Pontiac Grand Prix then this little 4 cylinder. I wish I would of taken better looks into it and not have let the warranty win me over cause now I want another car so bad and I don't want this car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I do like the steering wheel controls and the new grill style - but that is all, the rest feels like a cheap little normal car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Suzuki car. I liked my '01 Esteem so much, I thought I'd try another Suzuki. So far I have been very satisfied. I am a large person, and this is the first car I have owned where I could not slide the seat all the way back; it was too far from the wheel to be comfortable! It has all the extras I was looking for, has enough 'get-up-and-go' for my style of driving, and the controls are laid out nicely. I do think I will spend a few bucks and get some nicer wheels; the steel wheels w/hubcaps have got to go.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The whole package seems nice to me. I can't think of any one thing I could call a favorite.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Forenza is the best value on the street. I have had two Civics and one Corolla and the Forenza tops them all. For what you pay for the Forenza you couldn't get a bone stock Civic. The Forenza comes with all power windows, a really good stereo, and a world class a/c. Suzuki has come along way from jet skis and motorcycles. With America's best warranty 7years/100,000, why wouldn't you go with the Forenza?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the stereo controls are right at your finger tips. Air bags on driver and pasenger come with front and side. Seats four adults easy. Very big trunk.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>What a Surprise</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>The car performs well, and is quite comfortable - even for my 6'1", 250 lb son behind the wheel. His girlfriend is 5'9", neither of them could fit well in my Sebring. Acceleration is impressive for such a small car, and with the italian styling, I've had people ask me what type of car I'm driving. With a 100k 7 year warranty, I know I can drive this car for years without a worry. It's definitely worth consideration.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MP3 jack. Controls in arms reach. Gas tank cover only opens via auto release. Large trunk.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been driving for more years than I would like to share! I have driven all types of cars and trucks and motorcycles. (Owned a Geo Metro back in the 90s with a Suzuki engine.) And have owned 2 Suzuki motorcycles, all with excellent results. I just bought the car yesterday. My wife and I love it. We think it will meet our needs nicely. I am a big guy and I have plenty of room in this car. Nice interior, comfortable, looks great. This car is worth a look, bigger interior than the Hondas and Toyotas Take a look and compare for yourself, you will be plesantly surprised. When the "after glow" from the purchase wears off, and when I have some miles on it, I will let you know!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice design, all controls make sense and are nicely located. Lots of features and extras, and a killer warranty. Tons of trunk space, fold down back seat is a nice touch.</FAVORITE>
