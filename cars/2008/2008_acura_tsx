<TEXT>Just purchased this car. A used 08 with 20K on the odometer. What sold me was the incredible build quality, handling, comfort and the performance of the 2.4L VTEC engine. This is a fantastic sport/luxury sedan. Clean lines and no "fast and furious" body work. I'm used to an AWD sedan so I'm a little concerned about this car's bad weather handling with the Michelin Pilots. Have to wait and see. So far in the dry heat and heavy thunderstorms of summer, it's handled very well. The car inspires you to test it's limits. The VTEC is very eager to rev and run.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This car has it all. Hard to pick one feature. All are represented equally well (engine, handling, comfort, appearance).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I know there are a lot of complaints about the low end torque. Let's put things in perspective though. It's a 2.4L 4 cylinder putting out 205 naturally aspirated horsepower. It does it in an extremely smooth manor too. Isn't that how a sport luxury sedan engine should perform? After driving everything from fire-breathing pushrod v8's to boxer 4's all I can say is this engine is a jewel. Honda/Acura builds the best 4 cylinders. Period. Smooth, powerful, economical. The gearing on the 5 speed auto is excellent. The interior is flawless. Everything where it should be and it's very comfortable. Awesome handling. Steering is perfectly weighted. Drive by wire throttle is very slick.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, suspension, interior, exterior. In that order. Very refined, mature looking sedan. Not trendy or "boy racer" looking. Might even be described as boring. I wouldn't say that but I know in 10 years this car will still be handsome. Just like an Acura should be.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this car for 2yrs now and overall I truly love it. I have it in pearl white w/ black leather interior and it looks great. The HIDs are awesome and the handling is top notch. The lights in the dashboard look nice (blue white and red) & are bright. The leather bucket seats are comfortable for me (I'm 5'4)and there is plenty of room inside. Driving feels extremely smooth and breaking is great. This is my first car and I'm scared to try a new one b/c I might be disappointed. I prefer the '08 model over the '09 simply b/c the exterior look can't be beat. I love this car & I don't want to give it up next yr when my lease is over. I recommend it to all who love a fun, safe, & reliable car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>HIDs (& highbeams), heated side mirrors, memory & heated seats, bluetooth link, body style & appearance, iPod connect, fast & smooth ride, homelink, buttons on driving wheel (vol., BT link, etc.) It's a beautiful car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned a variety of makes and models. I have pretty much settled on Honda and Acura as the vehicles of choice for me. I sold an RL to get the TSX. I wanted something with better mileage and sportier look and feel. I am very happy with the TSX. It is smooth and stiff in the right places and times. The VTEC really hums when you crank up the RPM's. I am getting pretty good mileage too. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Memory seats are always nice. The bluetooth phone is nice also. Decent mileage for a car that wants to run also. The styling is middle of the road. Preferred over the 09 model.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first experience with a Honda product. Purchased the car directly off the showroom floor. Beautiful black exterior with tan leather seats and wood grained interior; rear spoiler, loaded but without the navigation system. Unfortunately, the dash had a rattle from day one. After 6 trips (and counting) the dealership has not been able to resolve the rattle, and it continues to be worse and never stops - not something I expected from a Honda product. Previously I drove Ford Explorers, Mercedes C230 and Mercedes SLK 320. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned the TSX for a year now. I'm surprised about the inadequate gas mileage. My daughter owns the 1986 model TL, and she gets much better gas mileage than me! A new car? I do like the handling and the driving experience though. The sunroof controls are out of place. The stereo could produce a more quality sound that is reflective of the Acura sound. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning this car for about 8 months I have to say this car is amazing. Excellent performance and reliability. The car handles like a dream for its size and it's perfect in the snow with standard tires. Took it on 3 long trips which were about 2400 miles and the fuel economy on the highway was 34 mpg with premium fuel and city averages around 27 mpg. Was looking at Lexus is 250 and Infiniti g35 but got the TSX fully loaded with nav package for at least 7-10k less and the Acura dealers offer amazing customer service. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>HID headlights, heated seats, nice stock sound system with 6 disc and the Acura nav is amazing, but wished the 08 TSX offered weather/traffic updates like the 09 TSX.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Coming from a long line of Civics (parents bought me a new '98 Civic LX sedan my freshman year of college, moved on to a '03 Civic LX coupe, then a '03 Civic LX sedan, and finally a '99 Civic EX coupe) you would think buying an Acura would be a no-brainer. My next car was going to be a 06-07 WRX, however I wasn't ready to buy one in 06 and I couldn't land a good deal on an 07. I test drove the 6-speed TSX and was sold, offers luxury and refinement ALONG WITH great looks and sporty handling. People complain about the power, but with the closely geared 6-speed transmission I really don't think I'd need any more power unless I was tracking the car. I love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a Jeep Wrangler for 11yrs, & wanted something in this class. I looked at the Audi A4, BMW328, G35, & thought the Acura was the best all- around car. CPO, 14k miles. I've had for 3 weeks & have been very happy. It's been an early winter so far, & the car has generally been great in the snow (this was my main reason for contemplating the AWD models like A4).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The trunk is much larger than I thought it would be. The bluetooth hands-free is wonderful. I got a black one with a spoiler (& black leather), & it looks really sharp.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I found this to be a joy to drive from the moment I test drove it in crisp Alaska October. The handling has been great even on snowy roads. All I hope for now is just a tad bit more thrust, say an additional 75 horses would be nice. I have had a few issues with the hands free but over all love the car, and the deal I got made me felt I stole it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior design was icing on the cake along with the HID lights. Love the carbon gray color, gives it a sophisticated look, without the cost.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After owning German cars for 20 years I've switched to a TSX. This was the only Japanese car that had a German "feel" to it, but with none of the reliability issues that have plagued my German car ownership experience. German cars, when not in the shop, are still the benchmark for interior design and driver handling, but the TSX comes so close that it won me over from selecting a Jetta GLI. The driving feel is very Euro, with stiff steering, taught suspension, and would perform very well on the autobahn as it is the Euro Accord. I'm looking forward to a long trouble free ownership. </TEXT>

The interior is very comfortable as I am 5"10" tall and don't at all feel cramped. Got a great deal at the end of the year and liked the '08 model much more than the "09 model that was about to come out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Previous vehicles were all domestic trucks/SUVs. This little car is big on fun, features, & value. 6-sp transmission is the way to go - crisp and smooth. Could use more torque off the line, but then again I'm averaging 26 mpg with about 60/40 city/hwy driving. Exterior design is clean and has a "smart" look to it. Interior is cozy, with soft to the touch materials, and also feels bigger than it actually is. Had a great experience with dealer; all done over the phone. If you're looking for the perfect balance of design, style, performance, and economy, this simply can't be beat at the price point.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car, with excellent features for its price. I have been driving it for about a week and I love it. Nice handling and great gas mileage. Sure, some people would want a little more HP, but its works fine for me and I have no problems passing other cars. I have the parchment interior with wood trim, it just looks magnificent. Dealer gave an offer that we couldn't refuse. About the same size as my old 2005 Infiniti G35 so it works out great. Been looking to switch to Acura after buying an Accord last year and now my wife drives the Accord and I have the Acura. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Though I miss it greatly, I traded in my Tahoe z71 due to gas prices. As a serious car buff i searched long and hard for a good car to purchase that i could take to college. Factors included attractiveness, performance, gas mileage, comfort, resale value, MSRP, and expected yearly cost including gas. The TSX has filled its position nicely, performing and driving better than my girlfriend's 2009 model. My notes are as follows; allow a break in period as it is required to get to peak performance, 65-70 on a flat trip you will get well over 30 mpg, the car does turn heads, the leather on the seats creases easily, the kick plates will chip quickly, and it is well worth it to add a cold air intake.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation in the TSX, as in most Acuras, is superb. The exhaust note, for those to whom it matters, is a nice purr and evidence of the small but mighty performance tuned 2.4L engine. And for a college student the great trunk space is a major plus. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After a 92 and 98 Accord, I decided to upgrade to the Acura TSX. So far after almost 6 months I am not disappointed. This car is fun to drive and sporty, yet still gets awesome mileage (I have gotten mid 30s on pure highway). Commuting mileage is OK and can get mid 20s. For the price you get so many features found in many higher level models. Audio is OK, but not the car's high point. However almost all the features can be found on the new 8th gen Accord (minus HID headlights and bluetooth phone), in a much bigger but more powerful car. Above all, this car is a Honda. Dependable, great resale value, laundry list of standard features. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth hands free phone, navigation system easy to use, heated/memory seats, great mileage, MID/speedo cluster is intuitive and looks sharp. Controls are easy to use. Great value at this price point.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The TSX is a study in less being more. It may only have 205-hp and a 4-cylinder, but the power delivery is so smooth and the revs come so quickly that it feels quick none the less. It'll never win you pink slips, but it will certainly move you on the back roads. It's not RWD, but it still feels supple and balanced. Steering is too heavy for the Camry crowd, but enthusiasts will appreciate the extra weight and feel. The 6-speed and clutch are so slick and easy to use that the car is easy to wring out when the desire arises (or every time you drive it). The interior build quality is excellent, though the sound system is flat. Never liked Hondas before; the TSX's Euro-breeding fixed that</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Clearly designed and built for Europe. Taut and compact, it moves gracefully. Exterior is simple, but classic and handsome. Interior is outstanding. Gearbox is fantastic. Engine revs freely, quickly and smoothly. 4-cylinder fuel mileage doesn't hurt either. Standard features will drop jaws.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I previously owned a Saturn and the upgrade to the Acura TSX has been unbelievable. I have not had a single problem with the car. Not only is it much more comfortable but I am currently getting 31 mpg with highway only driving. This does drop to 22-25 with mixed highway/city driving in dallas but I have very little to complain about with this car for the cost.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation system is great and by far the best when compared to Lexus, BMW, Infiniti and Toyota. It is very user friendly and has a much large data base than the competitors. The lumbar back support in the front seat is also better than other cars with the exception of a BMW.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The steering, transmission, clutch and the running gear are all in tune. This is a very solid sports car feel, in a small sedan, still with ample room for 4 people. Having had Hondas since 1986, this was a major step up for me, and the car is solid, planted and fun to drive. Too bad that it has to use premium gas, buy that's the way Honda gets 205 HP out of the 2.4L four cylinder. This is a driver's car, with a nicely snubbed-up ride that is not harsh.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the '08 TSX for my wife. My wife actually likes the '08 better. I prefer the '09, but love what we got for the money. The car is solid and I maybe just becoming a Honda guy. The value here is way more than you see with the European cars, so I don't think I'll be buying another BMW. Plus the future maintenance costs with this car are much lower than BMWs.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation is cool (wife talked me into that one), but I wish it had the traffic advisory (like the '09 does). My favorite feature is just the overall value. You get leather, sunroof, nav, bluetooth, etc. AMAZING!</FAVORITE>

I decided on a brand new Acura TSX for reliability, low maintenance and other factors. It has nice interior, every option standard for a lot less. It handles great in the corners, stops swiftly, has good initial pickup, little slow from jumping from 70mph to 90mph. I have started to really like this car now. I plan to trade this in after 3 years for a BMW. It holds its value well. :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>My TSX is a great sports sedan that has enough room to carry 4 adults but still small enough for efficient daily commuting with only the drive. This vehicle replaced my Altima, and I love its smaller size and increase in power. The seats at first were very stiff, but after 2 weeks & 350 miles, they broke in and are now very comfortable. For normal in-town commuting and highway driving, this car is very lightweight and nimble. Personally, I do not need the V6 power, and this car's inline-4 delivers very well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car. Very fun to drive and very difficult to take foot off the gas to slow down even though the 0-30 mph could use some help after that its a rocket. Great standard features that require no further addition. Good price and overall value. Initial MPG is not so good. First 2 weeks of ownership: city: 16-18 mpg highway: 18-22 mpg. I hope it gets better as the car is broken into. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car replaces a 2004 TSX manual without the Nav and no built in XM. This a great car for the money. There is no other model out there with the same features and quallity for the price (aroung 30k). The 08 car has a lot more bells and whistles than the 04 version and I love it. The biggest downside to this car is the underpowered engine. I had a manual last time and went with the automatic this time... big mistake. The manual allows you to get much more power out of the engine.</TEXT>

I've owned 2 Hondas before, 1 Audi, and 1 MB-E class. This is a great car for those $3.50+ per gal. fill-ups without feeling like you are stuck with a boring ride. It handles great in the corners, stops swiftly, hauls tail on the freeway and still gets my blood pumping. I love this car, but when they get a V-6 or turbo, I'm soooo there! I needed better mileage, which the TSX delivers (26 in major traffic everyday). The TL was too heavy feeling for me and I know I would be getting WAY too many speeding tickets</TEXT>

<TEXT>Replaced '03 TL-S and while I miss the power of the V6, the trade off of better handling and trimmer size was worth it. Good power above 3000 RPM, responsive manumatic makes it easy to stay in the power band when needed. Build quality is flawless. Fuel mileage has been the only disappointment-only 24MPG, about the same as the heavier more powerful TL. Overall, I am very happy with this car, and think it is a great value.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got my 2008 TSX. I drove the car online using Acura's virtual system and found it to be perfect. I spent less than 30 minutes at the dealership to get a feel for the real car. After a couple of days of haggling my TSX was shipped from Lexington. This is about the 10th Honda/Acura that I have owned and the TSX has the least peppiest motor of them all. My salesperson described the TSX as an Accord on steroids and I would have to say that the statement is accurate. Acceleration is boring but the rest of the car fits me perfectly. Not sure if they changed the stock stereo system in 2008 but my stereo sounds great. It works great with my iPod.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am coming off a Mazda 3i 2005 and I loved that car. I was looking at the Honda Accord, Camry SE, and the VW Jetta in addition to the 2008 TSX. I test drove all the above and hands down the TSX drove the best. It was the fastest and the best handling. Besides driving excellent, this car has all the extras (standard) that you would want. My favorites are the Bluetooth and auxiliary input for your iPod. Also, I am not sure what people expect out a stock radio but the TSX?s radio is great. I got the car in black and tinted the windows and this baby looks great. In my opinion the TSX is the best car for the money right now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned 4 Hondas (3 Accords and 1 Civic), so I knew Acura was an easy choice. However, I have been surprised by the overall superior experience I've had in driving this car. I also considered the Infiniti G35, BMW 325xi, and Audi A4 but found that with comparable options, their price tags were far too high when compared to the TSX. Solid performance, exceptional build quality, great fuel economy, and brand cache at "value" pricing. Who could ask for more?</TEXT>

<TEXT>After tons of research, and lots of test drives, I chose the TSX because it met my criteria at a reasonable price. Car had to be fun to drive, peppy off the line, comfortable, have lots of gadgets (except navi), reasonable gas mileage, and be reliable. (Previous car was MB C220, which I loved, so it was hard to chose next car. Felt new C class too austere/unrefined on inside for the price.) I've driven 2,000+ miles since November purchase and have found this to be a great car. It has plenty of power for surface and freeway driving, decent gas mileage (23 mpg), great handling, and super nice interior. No problems at all. This car loves the freeway... best ride and handling at high speed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Peppy off the line and when merging or passing on freeway. Great handling, smooth shifting, all the creature comforts from heated power adjusting leather seats to bluetooth. Lots of cubbies for stuff. Doesn't turn heads, but I figure I drive a car from the inside out..great little car! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently returned a lease of a 2006 BMW 3251 6M. I am a loyal Honda-ist and am very pleased to be back on familiar ground. The BMW was a great car, but this is more like putting on a familiar old coat. The TSX may have missed by not having a V6, but overall this car is more satisfying and full of features that I love. The handling is not the same as RWD, but I have quickly forgotten that car and feel more confident in this TSX. I couldn't be happier.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My previous car was a VW Jetta (w/ Turbo). I was looking at 3 series BMWs, Lexus IS 250 and the TSX. I ended up with the TSX and could not be happier. After reading reviews I was worried that the car would not have the pick-up I desired. I envisioned it being like my brother's civic. Not the case and in fact I don't notice much of a differnce outside of not have the turbo kick-in at 6000 rpms. I also thought the body was somewhat plain at first, but have since grown to love it. This is a great car for anyone in the entry level luxury sedan market.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The TSX is not an Accord with a $10k "A" on the front; navigation is great; price to performance ratio when compared to other luxury sedans in its price range; the body and style of the car; and the interior design. My buddy has a 2006 325 xi and when the cars are next to each other, I prefer mine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just got this car last week. After you get past all the fun gadgets and solid interior, it's an amazingly fun car to drive around town. The engine is surprisingly peppy for a 4-cylinder, and the work they've put into the suspension really shows. I'm not a car guy, but when you go around a corner, it's amazing compared to the other cars I tried. It's a perfect daily driver that can also get you grinning on the twisties. Navigation system is great, love the fact that all the other amenities are included!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th "Honda" and 2nd Acura over the years. The ride is quite smooth with very little bumps to be felt. The car is semi sporty so the suspension will be a little stiff. My wife made a note at how it felt like we were going 40mph when I was actually doing 75mph. It is small enough to fit into small space and large enough to fit a family. The navi is just wonderful and so easy to use. For a 4 cyl, it has nice pick up. We have an RDX that has the turbo, I cannot imagine how fast the tsx would be with 260hp. I hear the 2009 may have this?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride quality, reliabilty, fair price for parts and tune ups, navigation, overall price, so much fun to drive I almost look forward going into work.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My eye's been on this car for some time, but after my first test drive, I thought it was a bit anemic under the hood. Decided it was best to wait for the '09, but then saw a great lease deal and test drove again. Realized with good use of the manumatic, you can really bring out performance. So pulled the trigger on the deal and have no regrets. It's a fully loaded little beasty that's just great to drive. Would match it up against the Lexus IS 250 any day for 5k less.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fully loaded with features/gadgets. No need to burn brain cells deciding what to get.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I don't agree with posters who aren't satisfied with the engine's power. I'm getting up to 35mpg on highway and never less than 31 mpg on a mixed driving tank. The car has plenty of zip for me (pleasant surprise) and handles very well. The technology provided is useful (bluetooth, homelink). The stereo is ok but not great, seats are most adjustable and comfortable. Agree with some that looks are mundane but I don't see the outside of the car when I'm driving. The cost to features ratio is very high. I've driven the car three months and 2500 miles. No problems and the interior is big enough, I'm 6 feet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went from a 1993 Honda accord with 250,000 mi on it to this brand new 2008 TSX 6 speed manual. The car is fun to drive, love the interior, tame when you want it to be, and gives you that push back in your seat feel. Plus it is fully loaded. Your options are, with nav or without. This is what I did not like about the Lexus IS 250, you had to compromise on gadgets.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Particularly the shifter and clutch. I also appreciate the aux input in the center console. Love the drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I focused my search to upgrade my ride from a long-in-the-tooth '98 Civic EX (168,00 miles and still going strong) on the Honda and Toyota lines. I wanted an economical sedan that was an upgrade from a Civic. I considered Solara, Camry, Lexus IS, and Accord. The TSX was an easy winner - based on value, appearance, size, and performance. My wife drives an '05 Accord and when we first test drove the TSX, she said "It looks like my Accord". Let me assure you, this is definitely not an Accord. The TSX is shorter and narrower than an Accord (it is actually more similar in size to my Civic). From a performance standpoint this car has great road feel. Try it, you will like it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Silky smooth clutch, great handling, user friendly interior especially heated seats, two-zone climate control, multi-functional stereo system including a great MP3 hook-up and XM radio. Since I live in Minnesota, I can only assume I'm going to love the heated side mirrors this winter. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In Japan and Europe, TSX is called Honda Accord. And this Accord is not the same as the one my dad used to drive. Acceleration is good and feels fantastic when you down shift and mash the gas pedal. Just keep the rpm above 5K and it will keep you smiling. If you want to pass someone in a hurry doing 70 in 6th gear, forget about down shifting to 5th or 4th. Just go straight to 3rd gear open it up and feel the rush as the bigger cam kicks in at close to 6000 rpm all the way to the redline. It doesn't sound/feel harsh at high rpm. Handling is best part of TSX. Being 4 cyclinder makes TSX handle better than cars with bigger engines, and I'll take better handling over extra torque anyday.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very comfortable firm leather seats and thoughtful interior layout. Great handling without harsh ride. Over 30 mph for freeway cruising doing 70 to 90 mph. Heavenly engine/exhaust sound at high RPM. Best manual transmission (precise) and buttery clutch (effortless) I ever experienced.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've driven over 40000 miles per year for the last 15 years and I used to think "a car is a car". Not any more - the TSX changed that! After 4700 miles in 5 weeks I still can't wait to drive the TSX. I am much more involved in driving the TSX, probably because input and response is excellent. Compared to my last "big 3" vehicle this is a definite step-up at a very similar cost. This car likes to run with the big dogs! It doesn't know it is considered an entry level sport sedan.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quality of materials, fit and finish. Headlights are superbright but don't seem to bother other drivers. Handling is predictable, solid and secure and tons of fun. Standard list of goodies is impressive. Driver seat is supportive and comfortable for the long haul. Sound system is strong. 30+ MPG.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first upscale sedan - a big step up from Honda Civic. Wanted to stay with the Honda family so Acura is a good fit. The TSX fits my desire for a smaller sedan, I hate driving big cars. It handles well on the highway and is comfortable to drive. Very happy overall especially in this price range. Am a bit disappointed in sound system but it will do. The navi system is a neat feature but not as easy to use or as comprehensive as I had hoped. Maybe the experience will improve in time as it is all new and I just purchased the vehicle. Great fit and finish inside. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this to replace a '98 Volvo S70 as my daily commuter car. Decision keys were reliability, comfort/ride, sporty handling and gas mileage. I have had the TSX only for 700+ miles and it's very fun to drive with more creature comforts than any competitor and I'm getting 32.6 actual MPG in 80% hwy/20% city Boston commuter traffic. I didn't get nav as I know how to get to/from work and top of the line Garmin is $1300 less than Acura nav. system. Weekends jaunts are smooth fun and it fits the family of 4 just fine. Not as fancy or stylish as IS-250/BMW 3 series, but it looks fine and is also about $7-9k less!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The abundance of creature comforts! Comfy heated seats with power, memory and leather, good sounding AM-FM, CD chngr, XM radio. Good instrumentation, seating position. Effective Bluetooth hands free phone interface & microph., fun sport shift when I want it and plenty of pep with 32.6 mpg to boot!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our second TSX (we have a 2004) and we couldn't be more pleased with this car. We considered Audi A4, Lexus IS 250 and BMW 3-Series before settling on a second TSX. They each had their strong points, but none of them really balanced the equation of price, performance, economy, features and reliability that the TSX manages. This has got to be the hidden gem of the Acura lineup. Check it out or you may just be disappointed with your next purchase! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Starting off with the negative. The TSX is underpowered for this segment. It also has pretty bland exterior styling. I would also expect better mileage for a 4 cyl engine. Radio is just awful. That said, it is fun to drive and no other car comes close to standard features for the price. Interior of the car is well designed and well made. Everything is well placed and comfortable except the station knob for XM radio. Steering wheel controls only scroll through the presets and if one wanted to simply change stations to something not set as a preset, the reach is a little far while driving. Seats are comfortable, but in a sporty way and they hold the driver in place. Very satisfied overall.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth is the best I've used, fun to drive, integrated XM radio.</FAVORITE>
