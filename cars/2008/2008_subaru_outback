<TEXT>I have owned at least 7 brand new cars in the past 15 years; Will not buy a Subaru again. My car is less than 2 years old & only has 8000 miles on it, the rattling noise while driving is very disturbing and annoying. I read the same feedback from another owner too. And when you fist turn on the engine, for the first 3 minutes, it sounds like a diesel truck! Is this because the engine is tilted 90 degrees and there's no oil around the pistons going side to side? Very disappointed, not to mention that there is hardly any room in the back! I will definitely stay away from Subarus. This was a worse experience than my last new car (Nissan Sentra 2.0).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned this 2.5i for 2 years without any problems. Bought new and has only been to dealer for maintenance checks (oil change, tire rotation). Fun to drive. Back seat passengers are a little cramped, though front seats are very comfortable. Mileage is better than EPA. Gets at at least 20mpg in town and 29 on the highway. Cargo area is wide and long. Have hauled a Hoosier cabinet and a large entertainment center. Would be nice if hidden side storage compartment doors would stay on (only thing on OB that is flimsy). Love my Outback. Best decision ever made! My OB 2.5i is a PZEV and it is not loud. In fact, my neighbors call it the stealth car because it is so quiet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Outback Turbo XT with manual transmission for just over a year, and I must say that I've found the perfect match! I love how I can change the driving style by a click of the button, if I want to accelerate off a red light like Andretti, I can by flipping the S# button, and boy do you feel that power! If I want to take it easy on a longer drive or in traffic and conserve gas, flip it to I and I can rest at ease knowing my car is doing its best to conserve energy. The fact that the clearance on my Outback beats most large SUV's is phenomenal for a car this size. I've gone off- roading in Big Bend and I've been able to go down trails Explorers couldn't dream of tackling. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very large sun/moon roof (almost makes you feel like it's a convertible!), Plush interior while maintaining its utilitarian characteristics of an off-road vehicle. My dog loves the cargo area! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall, very nice car. Leather seats are luxurious and comfortable. Decent MPG for AWD system. Accurate Navigation system. Nice cargo room. Back seats are a little too cramped. I've owned 4.9L V8, 4.5L V8, 3.5L V6. Maybe this is why this Outback seems so so so so so slowwwwwwwwwwww. I make sure engine revs at around 6000 rpm and this car doesn't pick up speed quite well. I should've got XT or H6 version. If you don't care about acceleration, then this car may be the perfect car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is designed for driving in Maine. It handles superbly in winter conditions. The low roof makes it perfect for hauling kayaks. My avg gas mileage was always 25+ in mixed driving. Last week we were in an accident in which the car rolled 1 1/4 times. My wife and I walked away with scrapes, bruises and a stiff neck. Of course we were wearing our seatbelts. The car was totaled. I'm looking for another Outback to replace it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a comfortable and well performing car. I use it to tow my pop-up camper and kayaks and it's one of the few 4 cylinder cars with a high enough tow rating to do this. The AWD comes in handy in some state parks when trying to maneuver in campsites and gives a solid feeling while driving in heavy rain and snow. My gas mileage is higher than the EPA numbers which makes me happy. The load floor is long enough to swallow a lot of cargo for our family visits.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had the car one year, kept having a burning smell that dealer couldn't fix. Deal pedal had a cheap plastic button holding that and the carpet down, and mine had a horrible squeak. Took to dealer 4 times, no fix. Had lots of rattles, and the car seemed weak, no power. I made a bad decision when I got this car, and traded it in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my OB LTD w/VDC on 4/30/08 and the car was plagued with various rattles coming from several different places. I was totally unhappy with the vehicle. I'm happy to say almost a year into owning the vehicle, all the rattles have stopped. Now the vehicle rides like a new car should - tight and quiet. So now I'm happy with the purchase and I enjoy driving the vehicle. Maybe the "bugs" had to be worked out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my first Subaru. My past 2 cars were Toyotas. I thought I'd give the OB a try. First complaint is the shockingly LOUD "engine" warm up due to the PZEV. It sound like a big rig truck from Mexico! I have started to notice quite a few rattles in the passenger compartment. It inconsistently shifts on hill climbs. But, the biggest concern is the "clunk" from the rear end or transmission at slower speeds. It is at the dealer now, but I'm told they were unable to reproduce the "clunk." At 5,000 miles, a car should be a pleasure, not a concern!! Regretting my purchase!! Going back to my trusty Toyotas!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>You'll be hard-pressed to find a family-sized wagon in this price range that has a decent reliability record. I opted for the Outback because of its very smooth ride and generous cargo space compared to similarly-priced SUVs. I have not been disappointed. Enjoyable to drive. City mileage for me (~17) is a little disappointing, but highway mileage (~29) has been a pleasant surprise. I wish at times it had a little more power, but in most cases it is more than adequate.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 3 years of researching I decided it was time to downsize from my Ford Excursion. I love my Excursion, but couldn't stomach the cost of driving it any longer. Even though the Subaru is a world apart from my "bus", I am getting used to the small size. The Ltd's fit and finish compared to other crossover vehicles was far superior. It is smooth to drive and after two tanks I've averaged 28 mpg in mixed driving. I'm 6 foot tall and with the much loved sunroof, the head room is tight and the leg room is adequate, while the backseat's leg room is snug for adults. I enjoyed driving the XT but with the premium fuel requirement and decreased mpg I couldn't justify it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The limited's sunroof, leather and wood trim sets the OB apart. The 08's grille gives it a sporty look. Good overall feel when driving. Great gas mileage for AWD.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have a 2002 WRX, wanted a vehicle with power and handling that had more room, more ground clearance and more comfort. The Outback XT fit the bill. The WRX is fun and to this point bullet proof.

<TEXT>Great vehicle, moving upscale to compete with the likes of Audi and Acura in the AWD crossover arena. Too bad they got rid of the steering wheel buttons/paddles on the limited, went to other controls for stereo and cruise. The iDrive system is cool, maps the throttle response and upshift points to economy, sport and sport sharp. If you keep it in economy, expect mixed driving mileage at about 22-23. In sport or sport# mode expect maybe 16 mpg and lots of tickets! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just traded in my '01 Outback for the '08 Limited model. I had doubts about buying another Outback - the last one was not much fun to drive, and there were some leaking problems after 90K. After test driving all the comparables, the Outback was the only one that fit the bill - reasonable gas mileage, good safety ratings, reliable, good roof rack for the surfboard, and can hold 25 bags of mulch in the back when needed. So far, so good. The '08 is lots more fun to drive than the '01 - the sports shift option helps. A little more power than the '01, and a generally smoother, better ride. I'm told that the leak problems have been resolved - time will tell.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Unhappy Outback</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>This Subaru does well in snow, is somewhat fun to drive, and gets good mileage. However, the interior is too small. There just is not enough leg room. When you look at the specs, it appears there should be plenty of leg room, but the seats are at an odd height or something so the numbers are very misleading. I'm actually thinking about selling this thing since I don't have enough leg room up front with a 4 yr old in the back!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car is very LOUD at first start-up (cold after sitting overnight). Called Subaru about this. Said this is normal for 2.5i PZEV vehicle? I mean LOUD. It does quiet down after it warms up. When I went for test drive the car had been warmed up by dealer. Same thing when I went to pick-up car from dealer after purchase. I think that they were trying to hide this from me. I was told that only 2 valves are working at a cold start in order to heat up the catalytic converter faster to achieve the partial zero emission vehicle claim? Sounds like a class action suit in the making for premature engine wear in about 2 or 3 years. I would not have bought this car had I known this.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2004 Toyota Tacoma 4x4 crew cab. I no longer need the truck to go into the woods. Several friends have Subarus. They always talk highly of them. I traded my truck in and got this vehicle. At first I wasn't pleased. It is a vehicle that takes time to get used to. I just went to NYC with my vehicle. I got 33 mpg, 27 mpg in the city. If you obey the speed limits you will get very good mileage. If you need to "punch it" when driving, it is very slow to respond. The back seat isn't made for adults. I do like the dash board display. If you need to replace 1 tire, then you need to replace all 4 of them because of the symmetrical awd. Thats something they don't tell you when you buy the car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The gas mileage is excellent for a AWD. Living in Maine the AWD will be a very good feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the way this car does what it does. Traded out of 1/2 ton full size pick up. I am very impressed w/ interior design, layout and comfort. I have big feet so the pedals could all use some more spacing but is not a problem. I like the aux audio jack but wonder why its hidden the console compartment. This does make it easy to "hide" what you have plugged into it. Hmm. The engine power is adequate and fuel economy is great for AWD vehicle of this size. Handling and ride comfort are excellent. Note on the cruise control... would like to tap the accel/decel buttons a number of times and have the speed change the corresponding number of MPH. </TEXT>

<TEXT>As the title implies we got the car simply because no one does better in this category. Not because we are completely happy with it. We have had long and good experience with 2002 model. Quality apparently still holds. Gas mileage is somewhat better than sticker EPA estimate. Performance is appropriate for the purpose. Comfort is good and slightly better vs. 2002. Design is clean and appropriate for the CAR Wagon, what it should be (Subaru, please remove it from the SUV ranks). Minor ergonomic design errors (location of handbrake and pedals). Major utility design errors (wheels, cargo space).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely fell in love with this vehicle after I saw quite a few on the road driving around. After doing my research and going to this website (www.edmunds.com) and Subaru's website, reading all of the great comments people had on this particular vehicle, I was sold. I got the sport package with the heated seats and the heated mirrors. I think the heated seats will help me in those cold winter early mornings to work when i have to clear the sidewalks at a school where i work at. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Outback rattles!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>This car has way too many rattles, ticks and squeaks. It's driving me crazy and this is unacceptable for such a new car. The rattles started one week after my purchase. I've been a big fan of Subaru for years but not sure I'd buy another one after this experience. If you're thinking of buying one, definitely rent one for a couple days first. A new car should be quiet for the first few years. The car looks good but kind of too small for a family. Black leather interior is hot hot hot in the summer months. The huge sunroof is cool. The fat leather wrapped wheel feels nice in the hands.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just purchased an 08' Outback 2.5i Limited with the LL Bean package, navi, and VDC. We really like this car. The 2.5 base motor is plenty powerful around town where it sees most of it's activity, and after it's first fill up we can proudly report 28 mpg. The seats are outstanding, the build quality is as good as a Lexus and the huge panoramic roof is awesome! Also, Subaru safety along with the excellent AWD system should help us weather the New England winters with ease. Seriously, if you are looking to buy something like a RAV4, CRV, or Forester, give the Outback a try. It is well worth your time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love Subarus and this is my 4th one. Overall I'm very happy with the car. Love the huge sunroof and leather. Comfortable quiet highway ride. But, from somewhere in the rear cargo area there's a tick type of a rattle and it ruining an otherwise good car. It started one week after I drove it off the lot. Still trying to find it. Sometimes the sunroof rattles - not all the time. Usually after hitting a big bump in the road, this sets all the ticks and rattles going. Kind of frustrating for such a new car. If you own one, make sure you set the SRS on the stereo to on. It makes a huge difference in the sound quality.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall look inside and out. Leather wheel feels nice on the hands. The dark gray color that I got is very unique and I've been getting lots of compliments on the car. 17 inch rims look so much better than the 16s of previous models.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the 4th Subaru I've purchased. My last one was a 2002 Outback which I found comfortable to drive. I've owned my 2008 for about 2 months and am looking to get rid of it. I started getting back pain within a week. There isn't enough foot room between the brake and gas pedals to place your foot comfortably on the gas pedal. In my 2002, the passenger side didn't have enough leg space. Now the 2008 does, but at the expense of the driver side. </TEXT>

<TEXT>For those of you considering the PZEV option you should be aware that when started cold some Subaru's will produce excesive vibration, engine and exhaust noise. This is due to changes the ECU makes to the timing to quickly heat the exhaust catalyst to reduce emission gasses. Once warm, the car starts smoothly as you would expect. The sales rep asked us to wait in the showroom while he brought the car around for test drives so I didn't discover this characteristic until I started the car the morning after purchasing it. Otherwise the car does exactly what I expected and I'm pleased with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Replaced my 2006 Outback sport with the larger version. Nice upgrade and significant price increase. I liked the AWD and style of the 08. Car handles great. Constant problem since I have owned the car is the transmission. It has been fixed twice, the third time the shop could not "duplicate it" Going in again tomorrow. The transmission shifts hard and clunks, feels like it is slipping. It was really bad the first 2 times. Now it does it under 40 MPH in city traffic. It's driving me nuts, litterally!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Outback for 6 months and have put over 8000 miles on it. Initial impression of quality is good. I bought the car due to its safety features, additional room for my family, and reputation for quality. I haven't been let down. My only real gripe about the car is the lack of horsepower. This car could really use an extra 20 hp. Not a big deal since I'm not out to win any races. However, the car is slightly under-powered in my opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Needed a 4 door wagon due to the new addition to my family. So I test drove an Audi A4 Avant (2.0T and 3.2 versions) and the Subaru Outback 3.0R was on par with the Audi Avant 3.2. Went with Subaru and saved $14K over the Audi. Also, plan to do a lot of outdoor family stuff (biking, camping, etc) so the additional ride height with the Outback made sense. I still have yet to open it up cause it's still in the break-in period, but this an excellent overall value. This car feels like I'm still driving my BMW. Subaru got this Outback right. Can't go wrong with Japanese build quality and a German driving feel at a Japanese price tag. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Replaced gas-guzzler 3/4-ton ?05 Chevy pickup with the ?08 Outback. My requirements; better mpg, able to pull motorcycle and its trailer, high ground clearance w/ 4-WD or AWD to traverse the 2-track to my cabin in Michigan?s Upper Peninsula, handle winter snow, carry my radio-controlled planes and R/C equipment, ease of front seat access for my 85- year-old mother. Went to test drive an ?09 Forester and while waiting saw the Blue/Silver Metallic ?08 Outback and changed the test drive! The test drive, on poorly maintained paved roads, felt comfortable, and has proven so. There is a very solid feel between the car and the road. Good value. Better than a SUV for me.

<TEXT>We looked at a number of small SUVs and wagons and went with the Outback for a number of reasons: comfort, MPG, and functionality. The other small SUVs did not ride well and seemed cheaply made (including Toyota and Honda). The ride quality in a wagon is way better and does everything I need it to do. MPG (28 hwy, 22mpg city) has been better than advertised, which is rare. Great resale in Colorado and low operating costs. Only 500 miles on it so far so I can't comment on long term reliability.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Outback 2.5i 5-speed manual for about 6000 miles, and I'm very happy with it. It gets good gas mileage, is fun to drive, handles well, deals with lousy weather very well, has plenty of room, and looks great. My mileage has averaged 25.4 mpg overall since I bought it, with a low of 22.2 mpg and a high of 30.3 mpg. That's good for an AWD vehicle. With the 5-speed manual it feels lively and energetic, and the manual transmission shifts very easily. It's a great all-around vehicle that can handle pretty much anything thrown at it and do it very well. It's a practical car that's enjoyable to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the large cargo area, the handling is great, the fuel economy is good, and the car is put together very well with high-quality materials. With good tires, it is a great foul-weather vehicle. I love having a manual transmission...makes driving it a lot of fun!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Outback handles great in every day driving around town or on the highway. Steering is light and responsive. The Outback's 3.0R engine delivers plenty of refined power with a hint of growl. The transmission delivers that power unobtrusively. I normally leave SI drive in Intelligent mode but when necessary "sport sharp" mode (S#) provides that extra punch. The Outback's raised ride height means more suspension travel (take that speed bumps!) and it has a smooth ride over rough surfaces. I think the Outback looks the part of a luxury wagon. The interior is upscale and comparable to my 2004 Passat. The materials feel substantial and fit and finish are excellent. Braking is very sure.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Subaru's legendary AWD is clearly my favorite feature even if it seems to get little use in everyday driving. The electroluminescent gauges are another favorite. The full sweep of the gauges on startup always brings a smile to my face. The multifunction display contains copious information.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my fourth Subaru Outback. For the last 4 years I drove a Volvo S60. The Volvo was a great car but had no clearance and was very expensive to maintain. I was excited to get back into a Subaru. I did have a problem with a tire when the valve stem came out while adding air pressure. The first dealership could not replace the original stem (did not have the part) and charged me for a replacement. It took a second dealership to get it right under warranty. I am also experiencing an electrical problem, the radio display and wipers will cut out randomly. They are always working when I take the car in so to date the problem has not been fixed. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great ride and comfortable seats. The turbo option is wonderful and I would not do without this feature in any future purchase. Controls are easy to use.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had a 1995 Legacy wagon that aspired to be an Outback. Years later, I bought the car I always wanted! My big feet took some getting used to in the footbox, not to say that it is cramped, but pedals are closer than my Honda. I am no WRC racer, but I do like how easy the clutch engages and shifting action feels great. Is surprisingly responsive when passing, especially for a four banger that is a bit heavy in the hips. Excited for the snow and rain, I'd like to see how the AWD handles it. Mileage is better than expected, 27+ in 50/50 city/hwy (as long as the dash computer is correct).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear storage options, fold down rears, supportive seats, seat warmers, shifting action and clutch, 5M rocks! Stereo has hidden Aux port and plays MP3 discs. Overall compact for having similar height clearance as behemoth SUVs. Sedan-like drive with utility characteristics. 12V socket in cargo area.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've had the Subie for about four months now. I am very happy with it. The lackluster acceleration is noticeable, but the trade-off is very good fuel economy with standard fuel (25-29 mpg), I suspect the tranny largely to blame for the slow feeling to the car, and a fifth gear would help mpgs too! The stereo is quite weak, and there is no rest for my elbows on either side when driving this car. That said, the car has generally been delightful. Coming from Volvos I am impressed with the comfort of the driver seat the value (half the price of the XC70) safety gas mileage and reliability. I'd strongly recomend this car-but realize that there are compromises made for mpg & low price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power heated driver seat, handling, quietness, ride, MPG!!, looks, safety, interior design, terrific in all weather conditions (much better than our Volvo XC70 which is AWD) so far reliability has been perfect.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my fourth Subie. I have owned all sorts of cars, from a Mazda Miata to a Mercedes CLK AMG, Mercedes SL, Jaguar XK, Jaguar XJ8, Lexus and several others. Subaru is one of my all time favorites, especially the Outback. This is a reasonably quick, versatile car with reliability second to none. This is truly one of the most comfortable vehicles you would ever want for a long trip. The ride is quiet and smooth, and gas mileage is suprisingly decent. I average about 17-20 in city driving, with 26-30 highway. Handling is much better than most SUVs, the driving position is high with excellent visibility and it has character. Great value.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Don't plan on the Subaru folks going out of their way to provide amenities. I have never seen a car with so few compartments for storage. No open area exists to put down your house keys, so I stick mine in the very small ashtray. There is a useless added-cost armrest which makes one lose more storage space. The lighting is red for night driving, so I feel like I'm on the late shift at a nuclear power plant. There are no night lights for the glove compartment or to find the "Door Unlock" lever. The cupholders cannot be taken out for cleaning and are not too versatile. The wind noise is better than in my last car, a Forester, which was very noisy. Outside visibility good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car replaced a 2001 Nissan Maxima. We got the manual with turbo and VDC. It is such a fun car to drive! It handles great and when you kick in the turbo you pass cars so quickly the drivers mouths are open. Could that be a Subaru wagon? I like the firm ride and tight handling.

<TEXT>I traded in a very nice 03 Subaru Baja and stayed with Subaru because of the splendid 5+ years experience I had with my Baja. In general, the Outback looks just fine and the Limited model has a nicely appointed and comfortable interior. However, the MPG on the outback is not very impressive ? 24.2 hwy (recent trip) and something under 20 around a very rural town. When compared to my Baja at 29 hwy and 24 town, I?m loosing almost 82 miles per tank on the hwy (worth $11.00+/tank at todays prices and subject to increase in the future). All in all, really wish I had kept my beloved Baja. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I did a lot of research and really wanted to buy my 4th Honda. I looked at the CRV and didn?t like the interior. I am a fly fisherman and like to have a vehicle in which I can lie down and take a rest. I have a serious back problem and need to take breaks in my fishing day. The CRV just wasn?t able to provide a long rear floor space. When the rear seats are folded down there is plenty of room for me at 5?9?. Interestingly enough, the Honda dealer sent us to Subaru! The Subie us everything I wanted. I am an environmentalist and biologist so my carbon footprint and controlling pollution output is important. So far we have gotten 25 mpg in mixed driving short trips (a bit disapointing).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature is the ride/handling combination. The wheel base is long enough to prevent pitching yet short enough to allow for a fairly tight turning radius. The smoothness of the ride is exceptional in a ?crossover? vehicle and the AWD gives a sense of security that is difficult to match.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving only Accords for 22 years, I wanted to try something else. Subaru came to my attention on both the NHTSA site, and the IIHS site for safety. Consumer Reports gave it high marks for reliability and user reports say 30mpg hwy. I have come to this conclusion after the 1st 1000 miles: it is as fun to drive as a Volkswagen Jetta or Passat, rated as safe or safer than any Volvo, yet has a reliability rating beating both of these. Below 60 mph it is an absolute blast to drive. I don't know why but it is. My wife keeps asking to take it for her local errands. Above 60, steering is more sensitive than a Honda and is taking some getting used to. </TEXT>

Nav. screen (which should be mounted on the dash). Climate controls placed low behind gearshift, audio controls lowered. You used to be able to adjust with a glance, now you have to take your eyes off the road. No storage for cds or loose change. The ashtray barely holds a chapstick.

<TEXT>We purchased an '08 Outback 2.5i. The car feels solid, drives well, and is adequate in interior comfort. The car's engine power is adequate, but not impressive. We enjoy the handling of the car the most, but haven't tested it in snow/ice conditions yet. We've been averaging around 26-27 mpg hwy, which is impressive considering the full time AWD. A knock against the car is that we've had an issue with the passenger side airbag sensor. It turns on and off intermittently. We were told it's a safety design issue for small children. My wife is approx 5'4" 110 pounds and doesn't always set off the sensor. We find this odd, and are researching the issue further. </TEXT>

I like that everything seems convenient to reach for me. My husband is 6'4 and he actually has headroom. I had looked at the Honda CRV too but I just kept coming back to my Outback and happy that I did!

<TEXT>Subaru has dominated rally racing for decades and it shows. Their full-time symmetrical VTD AWD system, and their electronic stability control are STILL vastly superior to the nearly useless "slip and HOPE to grip" modified FWD systems found on the pretenders. We drove EVERY AWD NHTSA top safety pick vehicle under $40K. I forced my wife to try emergency steering maneuvers at 65 mph. The Hyundai santa Fe, and Honda Pilot were scary ,even the Acura RDX could not match the Outback's "go where you point it" highway stability. Having now driven the Outback on a lot of snowy, icy it has dramatically exceeded my already high expectations.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>No longer worrying when my wife commutes in bad weather! Best traction and emergency handling on the market, crash rating second to none. The 6 cylinder engine with SI-Drive is surpisingly quick, smooth and fun to drive and puts the car in a completely different league than the base 4 cylinder</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my wife's car, I have been very impressed. Excellent handling, especially in the awful winter we've had in WI. Exterior and interior are very well done. Fit and finish is very good. The wagon utility is unquestionable. I think the car is very good value with the AWD and what you get in terms of extras with the LL Bean addition. Nav system is very good, the stereo is actually quite impressive. My benchmark is my 2008 Acura RL AWD, and considering the Subie is close to half the price I think it's an extraordinarily good value. My only issue is that, considering the cars weight, I think the base 2.5 liter engine is a little underwhelming. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Subaru and perhaps my last. After having a fun and wonderful drive home to Michigan from Virginia my Outback gave me a full "light show." Most of the warning lights came on, the most interesting being the "check engine" light. Computer problems. It has been back to the dealer service department 3 times now. It has been in the shop for more then 2 weeks. I bought it on 12/12/07, it has approx. 3100 miles on it, and I just made my first payment. The service department has been great, but my first Subaru experience has been a headache and a heartache. Will be using the lemon law if the car returns to the shop for a 4th time.

With only 1500 miles, the car is getting 23mpg (city/hwy combined). It rides 10x better than my 2006 Honda Accord and much quieter I must say. This Subaru is surprisingly elegant with a great interior layout, quiet, smooth ride, good handling all the while maintaining nice attention to luxury and durability.

Looked at every crossover and small truck SUV available, and found the Outback to be the best combination of sensible size/mileage and cargo capacity. We ski and have a place in Durango, CO so we needed AWD. Very satisfied with the Outback - fit and finish are excellent, ride is superb, decent handling, 170 HP flat four is definitely adequate for us, mileage has consistently been 25 MPG. Interior is nice looking and functional - not the weird and techno-ugly stuff we've seen in other vehicles. Great driver's seat (the 2000 Explorer had the worst!), sound system is excellent.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first new car, and first Subaru. My wife's car (bought new) is a Highlander 2005 2WD. I was deciding between the Outback in LL Bean trim and a Honda Pilot. The fuel economy difference was the deciding factor. I personally think the Outback is a beautiful car. It's also plenty peppy with its V6. I like the nav system, but wish it was integrated into the other components of the car, particularly the stereo. It would also be nice to have Bluetooth. Final gripe is that interior space is scant. There is enough, but more would be nice. This car in LL Bean trim is quite luxurious, in my opinion. The fit and finish are excellent, and the materials appear to be of high quality.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been driving a civic hatchback for the past several years. I loved the civic, but with a growing family, I had to buy something a little roomier. The Outback was a good compromise between the civic that I loved, and the SUVs that I hate. It has enough room inside for me, my wife, and two small children in the back, with car seats. Being a family car, I also like the various standard safety features . The cargo area along with the roof racks, make the outback a great "errand runner". My only complaint is the the lack of power. I describe the outback's power as barely adequete. It could really use about 10-20 more horsepower. Not terrible, but noticable. Overall I do like the car alot. </TEXT>

I immediately upgraded the tires and the rear sway bar - instant handling upgrade. The 2.5i is really well matched to the 5MT (I've been disappointed by rental 4ATs OBs before). Have been averaging ~25+ mpg overall - 70/30 highway/urban. This is my first AWD car and its been interesting in the recent snows - its a new driving experience that's for sure.

<TEXT>Had a 2000 Outback, liked it so well, I bought a 2008 Outback Wagon 5 spd man trans. It has 1,522 miles and just started this engine racing thing. When you shift thru from 1st to 5th gear it seems as though the gas is sticking causing RPMs to go up when you let off the accelerator. Sometimes when you downshift, the engine races like the accelerator is sticking. Took it to the dealer, he called Subaru Techline but before he could finish telling them what was wrong they said it was normal operation. We find that hard to believe. Racing past 2000rpms when the clutch is pressed and no foot on the accelerator doesn't seem normal to us. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We were looking at small SUVs (CRV, Santa Fe, RAV4) and decided to check out the Outback as well. What a difference! The ride is so much better. Subaru is a much safer and more reliable car than the others we looked at. The exterior is much improved and the interior is very simple. This is our "baby car", so we are happy the car seat is easy to install and the cargo space is awesome. The 170 hp engine isn't great, but is still muc better than the models I listed above. I tested all the models on a nasty hill near our house and the Outback actually performed the best.</TEXT>

I find the size to be just right. I am having trouble using the NAV system and dealer thinks it was not "prepped" correctly and is checking things out. Otherwise no problems to date. Wife's 07 has just had the power steering pump go out, however.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2800 miles and I was concerned about the higher height and handling compared to my previous 98 Legacy GT but this Outback can take the corners as well as the Legacy did and has a softer ride. Having a WRX as well, this car handles surprisingly well for something with more ground clearance than an Explorer! Getting 24mpg in suburban roads. Front seats are incredibly confortable but coudl do with a memory function. Radio/HVAC controls need to be easier to use, you need to really look down at the controls whgen using them. The stock Potenza RE92s I have never liked (had them on 3 previous cars).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Obviously people have had differing experiences. Mine have been superb. I had a 2004 Outback with 100,000 miles; loved it, but decided it was time for a change. Tested the RAV4, Hyundai Santa Fe, and Acura RDX; kept coming back to the Outback. After 2000 miles, it's nothing but delightful. The ride is firm but quiet. The transmission selection system works well; gear selection on hills is much better than with the 2004. Biggest surprise is the mileage; guided by the gas consumption guage, and trying to maintain a fairly light foot, I've been getting 23 mpg in-town and 27 on the Interstate (contrary to the 17/24 official rating). The car is great fun to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We had already decided to buy a 2008 2.5i Outback when I happened across an Outback on the dealer lot with a different badge on the back that said "PZEV - Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle". I was curious as to what this was. Basically, it is the exact same car as your regular Outback, but with a more thorough burning of fuel and an emissions system on steroids. The emissions are as clean as a hybrid. My "Inner Treehugger" decided to splurge for the extra $200 for the PZEV option. We have been extremely happy with the vehicle. Unfortunately, I had to discover the PZEV since there seems to be little to no marketing for this "green" option.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>PZEV - Partial Zero Emissions Vehicle. AWD - All Wheel Drive. Great size for young family with kids. Easy and fun to drive. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We rented this car in Oregon for a week and drove it over 700 miles. A lot of mountains and curves, muddy back roads. I found it to be a little too underpowered on hills, very "shifty". Liked the "Sport" mode in the auto tranny. Base engine doesn't hack it. Useless arm rest just like my '97 Outback.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD is nice, Sport mode on transmission. Numerous safety features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>While I was initially excited about the purchase after test driving a well running car, my "dealer locate" vehicle arrived with what is commonly known as "stutter" under boost. The two dealers I have taken the car to both acknowledged the car does not run correctly, but they don't know how to fix it since it is most likely a computer issue. The dealership has "reflashes" for different turbo models and it will fix the problem on some cars but not all and it often returns. Subaru customer service has been no help, not even offering try replacing the computer on a $32k car with 6k mi. I am going to lemon law it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We are a two car family and use the Outback for around town as well as much freeway driving. The car performs beautifully in all conditions. Good feeling of security and reliability. The car is a basic 4 and we got 28 mpg on regular gas. This is our fifth Subaru and so far it is the best.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first Subaru and we're very favorably impressed. The car is quiet and handles very well both on the road and in the field when we're taking feed to the run-in sheds. Fuel mileage is great for a full time all wheel drive vehicle. Safety and reliability were key factors in selecting a Subaru. These cars are legendary in both areas and their strong, cult like customer loyalty reflects it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We like the big two piece moon roof and the solid, comfortable feel of the car. It gives you a strong sense of security and the moon roof lets in plenty of light and air when you want it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My third Outback and by far the best. Wanted a fun mid-life car, needed a practical car for the fam and the mountains. Subaru hits the mark with the XT turbo! Far more fun to drive than my H6 2002 LL Bean! It drives very tight and solid, very smooth and quiet, turbo kicks in nicely and pulls you along beautifully. I love wagons and the XT is the best combination of any brand/model. Steering wheel feels good in my large hands. Still trying to find the best seat position for my tall self. Skip the nav and add your own portable, upgradeable Garmin or other. Looked at SUVs (Tribeca, Highlander, RAV4, CR-V, RDX) and prefer XT. Great car for my wants and needs!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Beautiful gray color with nice off black interior. Great stereo (but had to tame the subwoofer)! Very fun to drive yet hauls us and gear around beautifully. Nice, simple dash and display layout, not high-techy cheesy like so many other cars today. Drives wonderfully. AWD!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this car 4 months ago, replaced 2001 Toyota Landcruiser. Tired of paying $75 premium, now I pay $35 regular to fill it! Owned 2 Volvo wagons (new) before my LC, and the Subaru compared to those in comfort and luxury. I looked at the Honda CRV and Rav4, too. CRV had good safety, but so cheap inside I couldn't stand it. Rav4 has very poor rear crash test, and I don't like when Mac trucks come up on my rear when I'm stopped and sitting in a car with no bumper. Acceleration is fine, it's no BMW or 8cyl, but gets me from here to there safely and in comfort! The Subaru has 5 star safety ratings all around - very important to me (and kids). Check out IIHS website for crash ratings.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable power seats. Safety rating. Ground clearance for charging into driveway in snow. Leather, nav, auto dim mirrors, leg and side room (great space between you and the door!). 30 mpg highway after 7000 mi, 25 city. 6 CD, cool illuminated instrument panel, under 30K, can't wait for snow!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought my outback limited w/VDC about 3 weeks ago. At first, my vehicle was hesitating very badly and I took it back to the dealership where they said it was a loose #3 spark plug wire. I was not happy at this, to say the least. However, since the spark plug has been adjusted 2 weeks ago, my vehicle has been performing very well. My ride is much smoother than most vehicles I've been in; I don't feel bumps in the road as much as other vehicles. The AWD is wonderful in handling a lot of turns as I live in West Virginia. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The panoramic moonroof opens beautifuly with a view of the southern sky. Drives very smoothly at a high rate of speed. Very well insulated such that there is no outside noise with the windows shut. Takes turns very smoothly. The stereo system is awesome!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned many Subaru models in the past years. This new 2008 Outback will be my last. The transmission blew out at 4,200 miles and left me stranded. I think that the new transmission selection of different modes might have contributed to failure. This new feature is more of a gimmick than a useful option. Ride of car is not good, very jarring over small potholes or minor dips in road. Way too much road noise. Leather quality of seat not very good for 32k car. Overall, car is not worth the money and quality of parts and the interior is lower than previous models.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Best midsize value on the market. I wanted stability control as an extra safety measure but was kind of annoyed that this requires a whole host of non-safety oriented upgrades like leather seats and a moonroof (which is actually very nice). The other wagons in the lineup require premium fuel!? Yeah, I wanna spend an extra 20 cents per gallon for the life of the car. Anyway, it is a very nice driving car, very tight for a wagon, and can carry anything when considering the interior and the roofrack. One more thing about the roofrack, take off your crossbars when not in use. That little effort will take 5 minutes and can save you on mileage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a blast to drive. Mileage is good and the sport shift truly rises to the occasion. Hard to believe this is 4 banger that cost under 30,000 for the 2.5i Limited. I trade a 2003 Ford F250 so it was a dramatic change, but definitely for the best. Test drove Honda CRV, Ford Edge, Escape & Explorer, Audi wagons. But for the value, the Outback was truly the best choice. Extremely satisfied. Taken up to the Colorado Rocky Mountains often and its performs extremely well. Compared to my 07 Lexus ES, this vehicle is truly a great value for its outstanding build quality, AWD, and economy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall value! AWD, sunroof, VDC, comfortable seats, sport shift on automatic. Very comfortable seats. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had great Mazda3 but couldn't sleep with winter coming, spent two weeks checking out Rav4 options. Then drove the Suby, game over. Rav4 has +7ft cargo, +800lbs towing, and losses on at least a dozen other comps. This is a classy ride, I don't need speed. It's got all the winter things Toyota charges extra for. Better ride than either Base Rav or Rav Sport. 4AT has 3 modes, what else could I need? The basic climate and audio systems are a good trade off for heated 8 way power seats and true AWD. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated everything, great road feel, easy to get kayak on top, 31.8 mpg on first tank, never under 25 so far, 34 on nice 50 mph north shore scenic road. Beautiful charcoal cloth interior, 3 AT modes. Only 1000 miles on it, but I can't wait to get past new car phase and explore.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great fun to drive. Mileage is better than expected, 24 mpg in SI Drive - "S" mode driving up and down canyon 5400 to 9200 feet on weekly shopping trips and local mountain driving daily. Handles great on curves, highways, dirt. One exception: factory Bridgestone tires squirm excessively on grooved pavement. Road noise is a bit high, but crank up the great stereo with SRS-WOW, MP3 CD and jack. Can't wait to see the VDC work on snow and ice this winter. </TEXT>
