<TEXT>I have to reply to a couple of earlier posts. I get from 26.5 to 29 mpg on my daily driving (40 miles round trip) so I was surprised about the rating. Also I'm still driving on the first set of tires at 17,500 miles. I read a review that listed 3 sets of tires in the first 20,000 miles. It does seem to have blind spots when trying to back up, but overall it is easy to drive and easy to park. It has a huge trunk, large enough for luggage for 4 on a 5 day trip. I bought this used with 7,000 miles and now over 17,000 and have not had any repairs at all.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The large trunk and extra head room. It is comfortable for even a 6'2" 285# man. I had the windows tinted and a remote start added - totally love it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love driving my car, however I have put on 17,000 miles and I am getting ready to put on the 3rd set of tires. Dealership says these cars eat tires and I agree! At $200.00 a pop for 205/50R17 they are expensive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is kind of tricky since I owned a 28,000 dollar jetta before this car. It gets pretty good gas millage for have allwheel drive I get 28.1 though 29.0 mpg most of the time but not in winter winter I see about 20-24 mpg I live in Indiana so I see alot of snow. I love the room in this car with a wheel base of 98 I can sure fit alot of cargo with the seats down. I love the sound system I got the 9 speaker premium sound and it pretty good. Note though my jetta had a eight speaker sound system that sound just as good with better bass and had no subwoofer in it. Love the no key start now I hate using other peoples cars. Basically a good car for the 18 thousand.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is an amazing deal and has been terrific so far! It flies under the radar screen because Suzuki doesn't seem to promote their cars too well. I'm glad I did the research and found it. After 7,000 miles, no problems at all and I love driving it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one of the best cars that I have owned. Fun to drive very responsive, lots of interior room, a very good ride for a smaller car. With all the extras like climate control,cruise control, outside temp. indicator, computer for milage P/G and fuel distance left in tank, all the control are handy. Suzuki did a fine job putting this vehicle together. I would recommed that anyone looking for a car take a good look at this one before making your mind up on a purchase of a car like this.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car for my first car, and it is pretty impressive considering the price. At first, it felt very slightly underpowered, considering that I was used to driving a car with 260 horsepower, but in reality, it isn't bad. The handling on it is amazing. It takes turns quickly and the tires stick to the road well. I live in Pennsylvania, and the traction control and AWD make it a very good car for snow. Also, the touring package comes with a 9-speaker 6-CD changer, which sounds amazing. It is probably one of the best car stereos I've heard. The only small downside is I have only been getting 20 mpg, but that's using full throttle a lot. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car for my wife who had just learned to drive (foreigner) and she absolutely loves it. It is spacious for a small car with plenty of room in the trunk for a full size suit case laid down flat. The car lacks power which they advertise as more than a MINI, but you really have to put your foot into it or use gear 1 to launch it and to merge onto Interstate traffic. Radio is sufficient (4 speaker single Cd player) Head room is great for tall people we are not AWD is not perm. but can be locked in as long as driving below 30mph. I had a 350z before this so this car can not be compared to but is still funish to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD or sense of it when driving in harsh weather, mostly rain in TN. Cheap to purchase as long as you do not get the sunroof and upgraded wheels and NAV system</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the very first brand new vehilce purchase I have ever made. I am quite disappointed. The exterior paint is "cheap & sensitive" (scratches down to the metal extremely easily, I have had to pay for protectant because of bird droppings marking it). The interior "plastic" (dash, doors)scratch extremely easily, and the upholstery snags like mad as well. The little windows on the front sides create blind spots. The window sticker when I bought it said avg mpg 30 highway and I have not ever gotten above 25-26mpg. Small gas tank. Cruise control is not standard neither are arm rests. Not terribly comfortable. Hard to handle in strong winds. Back seat not much leg room. Not "family" car</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Ocean Blue SX4 Sport now has 16000 miles. Its been very comfortable, fairly reliable, and still gets looks and compliments on its styling. Rear seat needs to fold down. At first, I thought that the trunk was huge, but the lack of a fold-down rear seat is a huge pain. Rear seat legroom is tight, and you will need BOTH hands on the wheel on windy days. The car is very sensitive to crosswinds, especially at high speeds. Fuel mileage has averaged 26.7 mpg in mostly interstate driving, which is good, not great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, comfortable for 4 people as long as the people in the back aren't too long-legged, really good handling, stability control, anti-lock brakes, all the airbags make me feel secure, and has been pretty reliable. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Runs ok in slow driving areas. Not good in California, 4 speed transmission needs all it has for Highway Driving. Windshield broke by itself at 13,000 miles, nothing hit it, The Dealer said it is not covered by the Warranty. It fishtails if you need to swerve because runs in front of car, at 40 mph. Gas for me is 29 MPG. The GPS stopped working and needed to be replaced at 10,000 miles. The fender needed to be fixed because it was coming apart at 2000 miles. This car is problematic. Next time I'm going to a Honda or older Oldsmobile or Buick or VW. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at the Mazda 3, the Toyota Corolla and the Nissan Sentry before I settled happily on the Suzuki SX4. This is a great car. I never understood it when people said a car can be "fun to drive" until now. The shifting is smooth and seamless, the car is very peppy and responsive and the acceleration leaves nothing to be desired. I enjoy getting in my car to go anywhere now. The quality of the car is great too. It feels solid and firm and is solid on the road. The cockpit is roomy and very comfortable. The stereo system and sound is just right. Everything just feels right with this car. The gas milage is very good. I do a lot of city driving and I'm getting 28 mpg in the city. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of truck space. Keyless entry and start is a great feature I never need to take my keys out of my bag to get in or start the car again. Automatic climate control is a plus. Traction control and ESP are great in NJ weather. Great gas milage. Very comfortable inside.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Suzuki and I am rather impressed I purchased a Forenza and I will say the SX4 is a huge improvement in so many ways. The car is actually fun to drive with unique style and its easy to own I have had this car for about a year now and I have had no issues with the car so far. This has been one of my favorite cars to own so far. The 4 speed auto is a bit sluggish to respond and the lack of an auto stick type trans was a bit disapointing but it still gets the job done. There is just enough horse power to get you onto the highway and above legal posted limits quickly so this car is no slug. From a red light the car may not seem to be to impressive just wait and see</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior design, 17 in rims no ugly hub caps, Auto climate control, Cruise and audio on the steering wheel, pleanty of head room and a nice sized trunk. All of the controls are laid out well and easy to use. The best feature is the 7 year warrenty on the powertrain and it is transferable. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had the car for 10 months now and I still love it. It has been great in the ice and snow. I have gotten up hills that other cars were slipping and sliding on. The traction control and anti-lock breaks have kept me going in a straight line when other cars in front and behind me have been fishtailing. In addition to being very reliable and safe, it is a blast to drive. It is so comfortable that my husband always wants me to drive even though his Saturn gets better gas mileage. I'm averaging 27 MPG and I drive 100 miles a day back and forth to work. I test drove a Honda Fit and Civic because they got better gas mileage but they just didn't feel as substantial as the SX4.</TEXT>

My sport edition did not come with the driving lights or cruise control, which is about the only thing I can complain about. Other than the 2009 model has an integrated GPS. But in the total package I would say the car is well worth it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As a realtor I drive a lot of miles, so I decided to buy this nice SX4 sedan sport with navigation as a second car. Believe it or not I purchased this car because it had a gps navi, but fell in love with it. You get a lot of car for much less money than other brands. 17" wheels, fog lamps, smart pass entry & keyless start, rear spoiler, ground effect spoilers all around. I feel like in the purchase of a navi you get a free car. This car is worth much more than what is priced for.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I can say I am pleased with this car. So far the only return trip to the dealer is for an oil change. The front tires aren't even feathering which seems to be an issue on other makes I have owned. Suggested Improvements - This is all based on the SX4 Sport Sedan - Sunroof option, remote start, leather seating with heated seats, auto up & down windows on all four windows, auto locking doors at 15 mph & auto unlocking doors when shifted into park, auto on/off headlights, smaller keyless remote that doesn't take up some much room in your pocket, longer wheel base to improve looks & give more rear seat leg room, better gas mileage with better acceleration, larger fuel tank for longer driving </TEXT>

<TEXT>I test-drove the Chevrolet Cobalt, Mazda 3, and Nissan Sentra. For the money, the Suzuki SX4 Sport is the best. The Cobalt would have cost $20 less a month (purchase), but was the no- options, manual-windows-and-all version in white (no other colors available at that dealer). The Mazda 3 was fun, and well optioned. But it was $20 more a month. The Nissan was funny. Neat interrior, but weird seats and looks. And it was about $30 more a month. Now, the Suzuki SX4 Sport had all the options of the Mazda 3, the cool interior similar to the Sentra, and only a little more expensive than the base-model Cobalt. The paint is fantastic, I got the dark grey. And it drives like a sport sedan. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the large 17" tires on rims, the biggest of all the vehicles I compared it to. Evidently this is stock, not an option. And the interior feels like a cockpit with the neat triangular windows ahead of the A-pillars. The high roof fits a 6-foot person like me well. And the stereo is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the SX4 in December of 07. Being my first new car it has been the best compared to my 91 Lincoln Mark 7 and my 95 Mazda 626. It feels like you're doing laps around a go-cart track. It's always eager to downshift wich makes it hit that right note at all times. My mom even wanted to borrow it and she has a 07 BMW 3 series. She loved it until she crashed it. Wasn't anything major but the front bumper, radiator, grill and headlight needed replcing and she still rides the same if not better then the day I got her. It's funny how the first accident my mom's ever gotten in. It had to be my brand new SX4 but you wouldn't even notice the dealership did an excelent job, another great thing about SX4</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the way it take curves, it gets the addrenaline pumping compared to my old cars. The 17's are a definite plus, compared to others that mostly only come with caps. One thing ide suggest is to look at it coming up fast in the rearview mirror. It looks intimidating which is never bad.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall this is a fun to drive little car. It handles the curves surprisingly well and has decent power for an auto. I had a modified Subaru and the Suzuki hugs the curves just as good in stock form. Not the fastest car on earth but it will put a smile on your face. So far we have put nearly 5000 miles on the odometer with no issues. Our sedan has the optional 17" black painted wheels with machined face and they really set the car apart. With the addition of front fog lamps it looks great. So far gas mileage is on par with the sticker but we have yet to get over 30mi to a gallon even on a 175 mile one way trip to the beach we never got over 26mi to a gallon. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the brakes on this car.You can stop on a dime. The exterior styling is very nice and much different than anything else on the market. The trunk space is great and interior space as well. We can fit a full size car seat in the middle with a booster seat on each side in the back with no problem.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looking a new car for me to commute to work. Test drove Saturn Astra, Toyota Matrix and Suzuki SX4 (Sport with convenience pkg). After compare with the price and warranty, the SX4 is the final winner. This car is easy to handle and with about 30 MPG (city and highway combine) but shakes between 65-80 miles/hr. Took it back and Suzuki dealer spend two day to work on it. I picked up the car and they told me it was the balance problem of the tires which is not true. The car still shakes and who knows how many time I need to take this car back to Suzuki to get it fixed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Suzuki SX4 ZXi car though boasts of high end features it's crap when it comes to quality. I have brought new SX4 on 4-4-2008. The reverse shifting gear was hard to function from outset. When I asked about it, Suzuki people told it's designed like that only. When it ran 4900 km,just before second free service, the shifting gear (reverse) got jammed. To add further woes, water started pouring into front cabin from the bottom..</TEXT>

<TEXT>Quick road hugging and fun to drive. I have had several small cars such as Toyota Matrix 04, Honda Accord 92 and Chevy Aveo 06. The SX4 beats them all in overall performance. The trunk room is great and the interior room head room cannot be beaten for a car of its class.My daughter is a tall 5ft10ins and she loves sitting in the rear. The car is perfect for commuting and long travel. So before you buy your gas saver test drive the SX4 you will not be disappointed.</TEXT>

I originally looked at a Mazda 3, but for the same price and options as the SX4 I would have ended up with a used Mazda 3 with 30,000 miles on it. For the money its hard to beat the SX4, good gas mileage, nice interior, warranty, 17" alloys, and more. I drive a lot in town and the highway for my job and I have been averaging 28 mpg combined.

<TEXT>I usually buy used vehicles 3-4 years old. I traded a Ford Taurus. It's like switching from driving a tank to a go-cart. I'm still grinning! For the 3 months I've had it, I'm averaging around 28 mpg with a good mix of highway and city commuting. It's hard to find something that I'm not pleasantly surprised with. The acceleration, performace, smooth ride, handling, braking, etc. took away my apprehensions of driving a small economy car. And, it's simply fun to drive. It has a unique, sporty look that sets it apart from others in it's class. In my view, it has the best quality ratio of all it's competitors. I didn't feel like I paid $2-$3K extra just for the manufacturers name.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the new 2008 Xover in Touring-2 trim and 5-speed, in copper metallic. Great car, solid feel on road, avg mpg so far is 29.2. Good on gas if you drive like you want it to be. I find the seats very comfortable, better than the Prius I was going to buy at twice the price. Cabin noise is quite low for this class, engine is smooth, doors shut with solid thump. 9- speaker stereo is excellent. Front end styling is great, back end could use a little more edginess to it. Very intriguing little vehicle. Suzuki, I wish you would replace rear differential with brushless DC motor along with smaller engine and make it a mild hybrid. I just might do it for you Suzuki!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, a fine little car. Love the exterior styling, a real headturner. Interior design is very good, with high quality plastics. The car has great steering feel, and the 17 inch tires and wheels make it handle like a go-cart. The brakes will make it stop on a dime. Fuel economy is very good, could improve though. Suzuki needs a 5 speed auto in place of the 4 speed. I'm surpassing the city estimates easily, but the highway number seems pretty accurate. Suzuki needs a bit stronger air-conditioner, it takes longer than I would like to cool down the inside on a hot day. Also, the stereo sounds great with CD's, but the radio needs stronger reception. Engine is almost as smooth as a honda 4.</TEXT>

Good on gas (getting 21.5 city driving). Lots of trunk space. Can't wait to see how it handles in the snow. For a 4 cylinder vehicle, it does great on hills.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I normally drive a Dodge RAM 1500 with a Hemi. I was very skeptical about going to a small car. This car was the funnest to drive in the class and also the most competitively priced compared to Honda and Toyota. I got the bluetooth, Ipod, and XM adapter as well. That was what sold me on this car. It had all the electronic gadgets that i need for the car. Overall it is the best in class for sure. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just sold my 19 year old Civic with 165k miles on it. This is a nice step up. Sharp looking car. Gotten comments on it's looks. Comfortable ride for a small car. 17" tires help the ride and looks. The steering wheel controls are great. Climate controls are positioned nicely. Trunk is large. Motor has plenty of power for me. I've put 1750 miles on it in 1 1/2 weeks and it is getting 32 mpg on the highway. Good head room in the front. Would recommend this car to anyone. I feel I got a good value for my money. I hope to have for well over 100k miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the vivid red SX4 Sedan w/ conv & auto. I've owned over 150 cars in my life. New, used, old, big & small. This car really takes the cake for value, comfort, looks, performance, etc. I could go on and on. (Okay, I will!) I am 6' 350lbs and I fit! No tipping the head to get in or reach out and close door. (Big guys know what I mean.) I can easily open the door in the parking garage and slip in and out since the doors are so short. Glass everywhere. Feels like a greenhouse. Tall seating feels like you're in an SUV. Handles excellent. Easy to drift if you want. Sharp appearance. Beats Toyo, Nissan, Subies and most other small cars in the looks, ride and standards department.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The SX4 crossover has mostly met my expectations or in some cases exceeded them. I have read lots of complaints about road noise, for example, but I find it to be a quiet and smooth cruiser for its size. Careful driving has given me an overall mpg of 30. (Quick starts and remaining in a lower gear will drop the mileage quickly.) The instant mpg readout helps you re- adjust driving habits. Staying under 70 on the highway also yields very good numbers. It handles great and is "toss- able," adding to the fun factor. Plus, parking is a breeze.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned the car for about a month now. I've got almost 2,000 miles on it. My first complaint is that the acceleration really is poor, but the vehicle handles corners very well which helps equal out the poor acceleration. The vehicle's IAWD and 4X4 lock works well and the vehicle is virtually impossible to get stuck in snow or mud.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I thought I would keep my Honda CR-V forever. It was 10 years old but I didn't like anything else out there (including the new ones). Sat in the SX4 Crossover at the Auto Show in Cleveland and fell in love. I'm getting 28 MPG driving back and forth to work. I do wish it had a bigger gas tank because with the miles I drive (over 400 a week) I have to fill up twice a week, but otherwise I love this car. It is quieter than my Honda and rides very nice. I've gotten quite a few complements on it and a lot of questions because there aren't many Suzuki dealerships in the area.</TEXT>

Car was fully loaded with heavy luggage (I was surprised how much it held, it didn't look that big). Handles well in strong cross winds at highway speed despite its high profile.

<TEXT>Honestly, I had never owned a Suzuki and was kind of reluctant to purchase one simply because I was not familiar with these vehicles Oh boy, Have I been pleasantly surpised! This car keeps getting great reviews from friends, not to mention the great perks it came with, and the much needed, built-in bluetooth system. On a normal work week, I used to fork out about 60 bucks for gasoline (California), Now after the first week of owning and driving the car guess what? So far, I have only put 35 bucks of gas and still has little less than half a tank left. Cannot beat this deal!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The SX4 Crossover should be advertised as a "Mini-Cooper on Steroids!" This little beauty is fun-omenal to drive! These cars are so agile and responsive, you'd think you were on a Go-Cart Track! The handling is absolutely marvelous! Trading my '07 Hyundai Accent Hatchback for the SX4 Crossover, was a smart thing to do! The SX4 has superb power and a comfortable ride. I preferred the convenience package for my needs, while my wife took the touring package. We are both extremely happy with our choices, and still can't get over how Suzuki was able to cram so much value in such a small package! Thanks Suzuki! After owning 5 Hyundai's, I'm sold on Suzuki!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a good all-weather hatchback car that wouldn't break your bank. It is the same car platform used in World Racing Championship series (w/ exception of turbo engine and vented hood) that had placed 7th at its initial entry. This is fun to drive and suspension is great for a small car and very stable when driven at high speed. I got 23 mpg of mixed driving which is not bad for an AWD car. My wife and I use this as our daily runabout car that is safe to drive through the worst winter conditions in Chicago. This little bug can trek on 5-in snow while most comparable priced sedans spins on the road. The all-weather capability and safety features had the most weight in our decision to buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is really a comfortable ride, it can be bumpy at times, but other than that is is a real fun time to drive, this car is fuel economic, but not as good as someone would expect.

<TEXT>Handling is excellent. Steering provides excellent feedback and control in pointing the car where I want it to go. The acceleration is fine. From a standstill, I have no problems and it?s even quite peppy. The four-wheel disk brakes are excellent. Highway cruising is nice and quiet. Visibility is better than any other car I?ve ever driven. Gas mileage is not great, especially when driving up a lot of hills. I?ve gotten 18-27mph, with mostly 20-21mph. The front seats are very comfortable for both short and long trips. Lateral support is very good. Dash controls are large, easy to read, and easy to use with just a quick glance. Rear storage is decent and versatile.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I could write way more than I'm allowed. I have owned MANY new cars in my life (mostly for business). We have only had this a few days, but I have to admit that I think I would like it for myself rather than letting my wife keep it! This "car" is solid, the power is fine, the idle is silkly smooth, the ride is exceptional, the fuel economy is GREAT for an AWD/4X4, the safety features are awesome, and the value is better than anything I have ever seen, ever. It doesn't have the acceleration of a V6 or the fuel mileage of a hybrid, but it is F-U-N! I will try to update this more later.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Keyless entry and ignition. DaimlerChrysler Slip Control (we just had one of the WORST winters ever). The suspension easily sucks up pothole bumps. The high ceiling and great legroom (I'm 6') fit me... my wife is 5' so it's not as important to her.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle was purchased for my wife as a replacement for her 1997 Toyota RAV4, which we gave to our 20 year old son who is away at college. This car is very similar to the RAV in many respects, small 4 cylinder engine, AWD, about the same size but a little lower to the ground. The SX4 gets decent mileage so far after about 600 miles we are getting about 21 mpg in town and have not taken it for any long rides yet. My wife likes pretty much everything about the car except the lack of an ashtray and the auto climate control is a little confusing at first. Some of the controls do not light up when the headlights are on, such as the steering wheel controls for the radio and cruise control. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Its so hard to classify this car, to match it with the "competition". Maybe it's because its on its own territory. Its a well rounded car - excellent value, outstandingly-well equipped, smart match of performance vs fuel economy that produces a car that exceeds and outperforms the others in everything except the price. Note: its not as fuel-economic as a Toyota Corolla but delivers more power and sporty-feeling, without being as pricy as a Mazda3. The most oustanding features is are the great ride quality and handling and Suzuki's 100k/7ys fully-transferable warranty.</TEXT>

<TEXT> This is my third Suzuki automobile, having owned an 88 Chevy Sprint and a 93 GEO Metro. While the little three bangers were great on gas, and very dependable, they weren't nearly as well built and fun to drive as my SX4 Sport. One of the reasons I bought another Suzuki - my seventh including four motorcycles - is the build quality of the Japanese built models. I considered a Forenza and a Verona but I wasn't comfortable with the quality control reports on the South Korean built cars. My SX4 Sport has two wheel drive (all the four sedans are 2WD) and it handles better than any small car I've ever owned, including an 02 SVT Focus. I haven't averaged less than 31MPG in 3000 miles. Fun</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This car is an absolute blast to drive. I haven't ruled out competing in SCCA SoloII autocross events next year.
