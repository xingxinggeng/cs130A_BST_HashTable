<TEXT>Bought my Mini new in 2/08 and the fuel pump went out at 17000 miles. Although it was covered under warranty I can only guess what troubles lie ahead. I also had to replace one of the run flat tires to the tune of $249. The car is fun to drive and I have adequate space since I no longer have young kids to transport. But once I experience a major mechanical failure I start looking for a new car. I plan to buy a new Honda or Toyota in 2/10.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my car brand new a year ago -- have loved it despite quirks with the windows (no fix for it yet...supposedly coming in late 2008). Drove it responsibly for 14,000 miles in the year to include a trip across country. Now the clutch is "burnt" and its not covered under the warranty. They are blaming me, which is ridiculous. I would be wary of buying one again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It looks cute and was fun to drive...until now because I'm afraid to drive with the clutch issue.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am very disappointed with the engine & automatic transmission design. There is a very bad dead zone in the acceleration in 1st from a dead stop. The top squeals when coming up. The maintenance is free but when they don't fix anything it's worthless. The repair shop isn't familiar with the car and can't fix problems. I have had to go back 4 or 5 times before something gets fixed. They have even lied, actually fixed something and said on the repair sheet that there was nothing was wrong. I would not recommend anyone buy this Car with an automatic. The rear view is cluttered and very dangerous to back up. The automation in the controls is stupid, mostly unnecessary and very annoying</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling is exceptional and fun. I like the convertible.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It's a fun car to drive, great gas mileage, cute etc, but very expensive for repairs. In one year, I've spent $2500 out of pocket on a car I bought brand new from the dealer, in addition to the gas to get to the dealership (100 miles roundtrip in DC traffic) and taking time off work (they close at 7pm).</TEXT>

<TEXT>My clutch went out at 14,000 miles, windows finicky (don't work all the time). Re the clutch: no explanation other than its my fault from Mini of North American and the dealer; I had to pay for the replacement less than a year after purchasing it. My previous clutches didn't burn out until 60,000-75,000 miles, so I don't understand this, but I won't buy another mini and will sell this one within the year.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second mini. The clutch went out in the first one after 2 1/ years years and only 22000 miles. The cause was determined to be a manufacture defect and was covered. My 2008 Mini S has only 10727 miles and is a standard transmission too. The clutch began slipping on this one. It is currently at the dealer and I am waiting to hear if the repairs are covered. I do not ride the clutch and do not drive aggressively or even need to shift that often (not a lot of stop and go traffic). I have read many posts on other sites about mini's and clutch problems. Buyer be ware!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had the car for little over a year now. It is an absolute BLAST to drive, and will always put a smile on your face. Fuel economy is phenomenal for a car this fast as well. Lots of cool features, like the folding mirrors, that are more fun the show of than functional, but fun either way. The pushbutton start is cool, but I wish it had the comfort access system. The leatherette looks nice, but I don't like the way it feels. All in all, for $25,550 and the included maintainance, its a lot of fun for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second burgundy Mini. My first was a 1967 that I brought back from Europe. Both cars were/are go- carts. The '67 cornered better, but was underpowered. The '08 has the power but it overpowers the steering. No complaints, mine you! Lord, what a fun car to drive. By the way, the title refers to a carnival ride, "The Wild Maus." It would snap your head off your shoulders, if you weren't careful. Read the complaints: Bumpy ride: It is a sports car - dodge them. Limited space: drop the back seats and think again. Odd radio controls: It has a radio? - who knew! I love to hear it purr!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Third Gear: The exhaust resonance is perfect, you are going 50+ and you know that you have three more gears. Drop Down Seats: The thing becomes a mini stationwagon. 3 suitcases, boogie boards and a cooler- or a weeks load of groceries.</FAVORITE>

First of all I commute 184 Miles a day up and down from the mountains. Phx to Payson AZ of an elevation change of over 5000 ft. I needed something reliable and could handle the road and elements. This little car has sold me for LIFE! I love the Tech with the Sports handling. If you're thinking of buying your wasting precious time you could be driving. =)</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far, my MINI is winner. As all other reviewers have commented on-- it's a blast to drive! Test drove the other subcompacts and MINI stood out from the pack. Cornering and handling are outstanding with no body roll. Braking is very responsive and fuel economy is excellent averaging about 31mpg combined. Getting 44mpg+ on the Hwy with a light foot in 6th gear. Styling is one of a kind. Base Cooper still nicely equipped without a lot of added options. Interior fit and finish is impressive. Ride is a bit firm, but still in a fun kind of way, although this can get tiring on long drives I must admit. Watch the road dips as this car sits low to the ground.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Pros: handling fuel efficiency (my avg 30.4, I think) parking (mwah, ha ha!!!!!...that little space is mine all miiiiiine!) power/acceleration dash layout fit and finish reliability ipod-friendly ($12.00 male-male cord. Plugs right in...totally easy!) Cons: Very jerky acceleration Somewhat jerky braking The seat belt thing gets caught in the space where the door jamb is.I've tweaked my back/shoulder muscles a few times. Hate that! Awful cupholders. If you can get a soda cup out without crushing it, you are amazing and you should become a surgeon. Trunk locks when doors are locked. Even if you've already "popped" it. Annoying! Wind wiper controls stink. And only two intermittent speeds.</TEXT>

<TEXT>O.K., it's cute, fit well in my garage and was truly "fun to drive", but the novelty for us was over for us in a big hurry. It is a very small car, and while likely the best in its class, we found it cramped, noisey, rattley and poor riding, especially on road trips. The run-flat tires are bricks, the premium stereo was fair at best, it was nearly impossible to get comfortable (no,we aren't big people), and I really didn't care for the valve rattle at start-up on cold days. I switched to a Camry SE V6 which is (yes) faster, more refined, has far nicer/more of "everything", and for about the same money. If you need to drive regularly, long distances or with others, don't buy a Cooper</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had my MINI for about 15 months. I'd have more miles on it but living in sunny AZ, I love riding my Bikes. This is one 'fun' car! Almost takes me back to when I owned a BMW 2002Tii. I had the JCW Performance Kit installed. Yes it really makes a difference! Not so much wth the JCW Brembo Brakes. Save yourself some money and stay with the OEM. Just about everyplace I park my MINI, people compliment it. My wife has an 06 Miata MX-5. Both cars have almost the same performance stats, but really feel different. The MX-5 is so smooth and natural. The MINI feels like every second it looks for a fight! What fun! Watch out for the options you order A $23K car cost over $40K easily Have fun!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Uniqueness. I could order it any way I wanted. Nav-system and voice recognition are light years ahead of my Lexus. Very easy to use. Road feel and handling great! 0 mph to trouble in less than 6 seconds. Back has plenty of room for shopping. It has an 'identity' that other cars lack. ATTITUDE!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I custom ordered my Cooper S manual last spring, and sold it after only 9 months of ownership. It was certainly fast (one speeding ticket), nimble and fun to drive, but even my 8 year old daughter complained that the rear seating was too small and that "she didn't feel safe". I regularly drive 2- 3 hour trips and found this car to be harsh riding, noisy and rattley. The small tires and wheels were simply no match for the rough roads around Ohio and Michigan. My full-sized buddies complained bitterly about no leg room when they rode with me, whether in the front or back seats. Buy it for the city and only if you don't have kids.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After shopping hybrids, smart cars, and flex fuel, I opted on the Mini Cooper. It is great on short hops and long trips. I have been getting incredible gas mileage on regular grade gasoline, 40 in town, 47 highway. The car handles like a dream and one cannot omit the "fun" factor to drive one. I have 16" run on flat tires, so the ride is a little bumpy at times, but for what it is, I consider it plenty comfortable. Nice leg room (I am 6'0" and still must move the seat up some) for the driver and passenger. Leg room for backseat passengers is questionable. My wife liked mine so much, she bought an "S" model with automatic. Recommend sport suspension and seats, with stereo upgrade. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Super Charged Mini convertible for 1 season and have driven it 14,000 miles as a daily commuter. No problems. Unless you call the attention you get from other drivers a problem. My kids think I'm nuts driving such a small car as a daily driver, but I respond life is short and my Mini convertible makes the daily ride an escape from the grind. Put my computer in the trunk, plug my Ipod into the stereo, and let the wind blow on my scalp (not much hair left). Motor on!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Head turner, slick styling. The supercharger whine, exhaust note, and g-force experienced when I punch it are addicting, not to mention illegal. Rough ride on bumpy roads but amazing handling and control. The back seat is small (it's a MINI, duh!). Muscle car performance at 28 mpg and I ain't sparing it. For traveling fast and light, whether commuting or having fun, you can't beat it. Leather, stereo, ergonomics are excellent (I'm 6'3"). Automatic climate control works well and doesn't bog the engine at all. Looking up at Civics and Priuses in traffic took some getting used to, but if I don't want to look at them I don't have to - punch it and watch them get smaller. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance and handling. The high beams will scorch paint. The stereo sound is awesome. A bag of chips, a bottle of water, and change from my $20 bill after filling up with no-lead primo is pretty cool too. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've got 3000 miles on my Mini S convertible and I found out the hard way the marketing in better than the product. I'm getting only 16 mpg, horrible. The exterior styling is great, but the interior is lacking. The cup holders are useless in that they are too close to everything to put other than the smallest cup in it. And that is indicative of the entire vehicle, looks good but doesn't always work and it's usually too small to do the intended job. I thought this would be a great fun car to drive but it seems I'm always driving to the gas station. I had a Toyota before and boy do I miss it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Mini S convertible is a cute and stylish car, with decent power and superior handling, but these are the only positives I can grant it. Ride on 17 inch runflats is appalling (and I have driven track-prep'd cars on the street for years, and ride motorcycles, so I am no 'princess and the pea'). Cannot adjust seats to my liking, knee rubs vs center console constantly. Ergonomics laughable (speedometer is a decoration as it's well out of the driver's vision, window toggles badly placed, climate controls non- intuitive), gearbox vague, rear- visibility non-existent/dangerous. Cute weekend toy car, but non-viable as modern commuter to anyone over the age of 25. Oh, and my mpg? Only 20 avg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Cute looks, good handling and the new for 2007 BMW engine with Peugeot parentage caused me to buy the 2008 Cooper S with the 6-speed transmission. Having driven the automatic I do not recommend it as it does not allow for the fuel economical 6th gear when in sport mode. The car is plagued by multitude of gremlins which in my case caused it to spend 28 out of the first 60 days at the dealership's service department. 1200 miles out of a total of 2000 miles driven were for transport to and from the dealership. If one decides that this is the only car in which they can be happy, I suggest interviewing the dealership to identify their service competency but few areas have more than one dealer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good looks but obtained at the sacrifice of interior space. Adequate power. Excellent Getrag 6-speed manual gear box. Good sport seats but they prefer slender occupants.

Excellent mileage, get- up-and-go, cornering, comfort, reliability, and just down right fun! Total strangers walk up to you and start a conversation about it.

<TEXT>Been driving about a month now in by base mini hardtop. Great car! Fun to drive. Sticks to the road. 42 mpg highway! Great engineering. Tons of room for pilot and passenger. Every feature thought through. The engine will stay on to ensure the car cools down, even if you shut it off. Hold the unlock button down on the remote and the windows go down and sunroof resets to vent. Standard sport button resets steering and gear ratio for more feel of the road. Very impressed.

<TEXT>The Mini Cooper S was the last in a long line of cars we looked over. From Honda, Mercedes, Infiniti, GM, Toyota, Smart, we looked over and drove various models for 6 months before deciding. The Mini Cooper S was hands down the most fun to drive. The acceleration, handling, and manual / automatic transmission features were the most notable. The Mini makes the simplest driving trips more interesting and exhiliarating with the feel of the road evident in every drive.

<TEXT>This is my second MINI. I will tell you that these are the safest little cars you can get. I was hit on winding road and rolled, and I came out without a scratch; and the car looked like it just got rear-ended. I love the go-kart handling, the looks, the tight spaces I can get into! I rode in a 2008 M3 and I noticed everything was very similar to the MINI. Everyone knows that BMW's are "The Ultimate Driving Machine," but the MINI is the "Ultimate Fun Machine," no ifs and or buts. I have the Sport package, Convenience package, bonnet stripes, auto tranny ( with paddle shifters as standard) and leather. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine sound, go-kartyness, great heater, brakes, safe, great sound system, auto tranny and just about everything on my MINI</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The MINI has been described as a go-kart with functionality, and that's not far wrong. The car is a blast to drive, but works as a comfortable, affordable economic daily driver. The gas mileage is awesome: I get about 35 MPG in mixed freeway/surface driving. The standard Cooper has more than enough performance pizzazz to delight anyone who likes driving, and it's even a decent autocrosser for those who are more ambitious. A great way to have fun and not go broke in the era of $4 gas.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sport button: it tightens up the steering and throttle response and makes the car a mad performer on twisting roads.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I elected to build my mini from scratch, and it was a really fun experience. Mini Marketing kept me in the loop with what was going on with my car and supplied me with fun little mini accessories along the way. I live in the city, and commute ~20 miles to work. On both fronts, this car is amazing... it puts a smile on my face when commuting (and not just because of the 39mpg), and makes me want to hug it when it inevitably fits in the most ridiculously small street parking spots. The car oozes character.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>heated seats, sunroof, secret compartment, cruise control, in-wheel audio adjustment, lane change mode for turn signals, power folding mirrors for extra tight parking spots, and most importantly... mini-sized proportions perfect for zippy parallel parking brilliance!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only had my mini convertiable for a week and it is the best car I have ever owned in my life.. this was a 40th birtday present from my husband and he really knows how to get brownie points, when I drive this car I feel like every road is my racetrack, this car corner's on rails, it handles like a dream, it is so much fun to drive, I traded a small suv in for my mini, and i was thought i might feel a little intimated on the road, but it just moves through traffic like a dream.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the auto top, and the heated seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I sold my Ford Escape last June, and hadn't had a need for a car since my job is a mile from where I live (I know lucky!). But as time went on, my fiancee and I were growing weary of sharing here car. You know waiting to get picked up, waiting for me to get home so you can go out, etc. I made it as long as I could, and finally bought the car I wanted, the 2008 Mini Cooper! I ended up getting one off the floor of the dealership, I thought I needed an S, but for me this one was the right one. It doesn't seem as small as it looks when your in it, and that is key for me, coming from an SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Panoramic sunroof, navigation, heated seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have a British Racing Green basic MINI with the cold weather option. Nothing extra and I love this car. People who say it's under powered do not know how to drive a stick shift sports car properly. You must use the tach, rev the engine and you have to love to shift! Use it's power curve and it will never dsappopoint. I have a hard time keeping to the speed limit. My little car just wants to fly! It's very similar to my long-gone MG's, but better. It's faster, handles better, great mileage, little engine, big heart, I haven't had this much fun driving in years. No issues with reliablity. More room inside than my Pontiac and room for friends if needed. What more could you ask for? Love it!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks - so unlike everything else! It has character and presence. Love the interior, stick shift, handling, performance, road gripping is amazing, the faster I go the more solid it feels. Ride quality and road feel are excellent. Steering wheel very comfortable. My little hot rod sports car! Love it</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wow! This is my first Mini and it won?t be my last. I?m an engineer so I first look at the data behind the hype, I then have to touch/feel/analyze the product, and finally I take all the data gathered and throw it on the white- board and present it to my peers. The results are still wow! The Mini convertible fits my lifestyle as my PC locks in the trunk, my CD?s and IPod lock in the glove box, and my Mini has ?BLING? just like my carbon fiber road bike. Don't buy this car if you?re don?t want to be noticed as I?m amazed at how many strangers walk up and ask me ?I?ve seen those and have wondered what they are like. How do you like it?"</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The convertible tops opens partially to expose a sun-roof configuration or completely to expose the full outdoor sensation of a top down experience. The super-charger engine / 6-speed manual transmission combination lets you feel the road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I took ownership of my brand new Mini on January 22, less than a month later the mini lost all its brakes (because the brake hydraulic line was not properly attached to the brake system) while I was driving 65 mph. Scary as all hell, could have been injured bad, but was lucky that the road I was on was relatively traffic free. Response from Northwest Mini was too bad for you and it was the same for MINI USA. Looks like the safety inspections do not include checking the brake lines. You'd think that would be fundamental. The Mini is extremely fun to drive but hard to trust to keep you safe. I really hope my experience is out of the ordinary, but folks should be aware before they buy. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats, suspension, handling, fantastic sunroof, comfort access, bluetooth integration</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ah! I have finally found the car I so dreamed of. Namely a car (to borrow the words of another automobile ad) when I 'press the Start Button' it presses my 'start button'! I traded in a 'perfect' 2007 Lexus RX 350 for the Mini. The Lexus was just too 'boring to drive. I wanted something with 'attitude'! With a doubt my MINI Cooper S is it! The only cars I can remember that I've owned that were this much fun and excitng to drive were my 1973 BMW 2002 Tii or my 1972 Capri (from Germany V- 6)! Yes its ride is a bit 'taut', but if you're looking for a smooth ride, but a Lexus or a Buick. Everyplace I go, people stop to look and ask or compliment me about it. In short, I love my MINI! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 'BMW' quality you find everyplace. My ability to order the car practically any way I wanted. Its 'singularity' as in you don't see many around. The sound system you get in the S model and a much easier to use than others NAV System. The ergonomics!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We took ownership of this vehicle a mere ten days ago. We traded in 2002 Saturn. The Mini Coopers S is 100X different and better than the Saturn. My biggest worry was storage space. All of our groceries fit into the car. The drive is like being a rat in a chase. It moves flawlessly through traffic and poor weather.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy to manage dashboard controls. Cold weather package. Power folding mirrors. Heated mirrors and washer jets. Heated front seats. Satellite radio lifetime subscription </FAVORITE>
