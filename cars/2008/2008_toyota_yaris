<TEXT>I get 40-41 MPG, mostly freeway commuting. Zippy and fun to drive around town, but not a great ride on the freeway (the car is very light and doesn't seem to hug the road well at high speeds). Definitely go for the manual - you'll get a lot more juice out of it AND better gas mileage. I test drove the automatic, and it was sluggish. The base car comes pretty stripped of amenities, but that's probably why the car is so low priced. I put a simple spoiler on mine, and I think it really helps the style. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The longer I have this car, the more I love it. As much or more than anything it is just plain fun to drive. It handles like a go kart around the corners. It gets around 35+ mpg in town. I love the 2 door hatchback because the doors are longer than they are on a 4 door and easier to get in and out of. It is short enough to walk around to the hatch to put things in very easily, especially with the flat floor. If you want cruise, make sure to get if from the factory, as an aftermarket unit is clumsy to reach and it is more expensive since the car is not pre-wired for it like most other vehicles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling is great. Gas Mileage is great. Most fun car to drive. Super easy access to rear cargo area. Turns around in very small spaces, very maneuverable. Did I mention how fun it is to drive?!! Easy to wash and wax. Neat looking car!! I love this car!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This month is my Yaris' first birthday and being my first new car, it has been a pretty decent experience after 15,000 miles. Very reliable car, no engine issues, manual is almost... fun sometimes. Air works well, and stereo is not bad. Only issues I've had are the easily scratched panels, very annoying... also the panels where seat belts are get gauged. My Camry had a more resilient interior. Gas mileage is excellent, best I got was 360 miles to one tank on the hwy, and for an 11 gallon tank, that ain't too shabby. The exterior damages way too easily also. Bumpers on this car are horrible and expensive to repair, try not to back into anything, its going to be over 500 to fix. Good car overall.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Peppy, good gas mileage, reliable, good basic transportation. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After months of research last year between the Yaris, Versa, and Fit, I chose to get a Toyota Yaris, and I am so glad that I did. I am on the road a lot for work (both hwy and city), so when purchasing a car last year, my main concern was reliability and gas mileage. When I first purchased the Yaris, it got around 36 mpg, but now that it is broken in I have gotten up to 41 mpg. I am very pleased with my purchase, and would recommend the Yaris for anyone wanting an economical car to zip around town in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm not sure why everyone rates the mileage so high. This is a 1.5l 4 cyl engine that should get at least 35 mpg in mixed driving and 40-45 for highway cruising (50-55 mph). I have been very disappointed that in 50% highway driving at reasonable speeds I can only get 30 mpg when going downhill with a tailwind. Otherwise I'm happy with my Toyota. I'm 6'2" and have plenty of headroom and decent legroom. No problem loading the family of 4 (2 car seats) with all the necessary gear in the spacious trunk to head out for the weekend. The trunk is also large enough for 4 sets of golf clubs (barely), however the back seat passengers need to be less than 6' or there's complaints about the headroom.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Yaris for 10mns and I love it. It is the most fun car to drive and you can make a lot of U turns. The gas mileage is wonderful, I get 33-35 except when running the A/C then it drops to around 25. There is more power than you would expect from this little 4cyl. My 6'4" friend has plenty of head room. I can't say anything bad because as far as I'm concerned it's the perfect car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car used in April 09 after my roommate's 94 Grand Am finally 'died'. He LOVES the car and uses it on weekdays and I get to use it on weekends. Mileage average is 30MPG with mostly short trips. Plenty of trunk room. My other car is an 08 Camry Hybrid and while the ride/performance are not in that league, the Yaris is a competent, safe performer. Radio reception is weak and it's hard to read the LCD screen for the radio settings - the CD sounds adequate. If you drive conservatively and like to get good MPG - this is a great car for you. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The doors have the most solid feeling when they are closed of any car I've ever owned. The power windows are quiet/quick. Tight build quality, no problem getting used to center gauges, excellent steering feel, cold AC and adequate headroom for this 6 foot 250# driver. Much quieter than expected. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the four-door hatchback, 5-speed (Mexico). Ordered the "base model" - got 15 inch tires, CD, ABS brakes, A/C, Tach, rear window wiper; which seems more than the base model in the US. I wanted to buy American made but could NOT beat price, quality, economy. Broke- in on Mexico-Florida-Michigan-Mexico trip. At 65 mph I averaged 39 mpg. Replaced back seat with carpeted 3/4 inch plywood, so it's a mini-minivan: the hatch and back doors are a dream for access. I really baby it around town and love its eye-catching good looks. It is FUN to drive; stable, peppy, stylish. I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I do. It is satisfying, even after over one year.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Yaris mainly for reliability and gas mileage and so far the vehicle has been good for this. BUT there are some issues that I wish I had known about before purchase. They are significant enough that I may have chosen another vehicle. 1. You cannot drive with the windows open because of a strange sound effect that hurts your ears. 2. The sounds system is TERRIBLE. 3.Cup holders in TERRIBLE places. 4. Air smells like dirty feet when you turn it on. On last oil change they found NO cabin air filter. 5. Just plain too small. My teens cannot sit in the back seat so we have to take TWO cars on trips. There goes mileage savings.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am used to small cars so a Yaris Sedan is not unfamiliar territory. What amazes me every time I get in it is how it has all the things I love about small cars without feeling small. All my other cars felt cheap and cramped. Not the case here. The performance on the manual is impressive for a 1.5L! You get plenty of pep. Now is a great time to buy too, got my 2008 used for almost 2,000 below TVM and I admit, I am no negotiator. I went with base model and I don't miss anything. Nice radio, solid handling, great styling, VERY comfortable. So I have to lock the doors and roll my own windows. Big deal. What a value.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Manual trans zips along. Love the styling in and out. Roomy interior for the class. Comfort way beyond most compact sedans I've ridden in. MPG!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded a Hyundai Santa Fe because of the gas prices. Stunned by the room in the back, better knee room than the Santa Fe. We were drawn by the looks and the Toyota reputation for high quality. Love to drive this car. No intimidation feeling on the highway around semis. No load road noise. Parking is wonderful. Control is like a larger car. Interior layout is brilliant. Simple 2000's style transportation.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased the 4-door Yaris a week ago as a second car & I am amazed at the gas mileage. We have a Jeep Commander but needless to say it's going to take a break until the snow comes. The car is so easy to drive & pretty comfortable. I really like the radio with the MP3 cd read. It's definitely a great car and would be a nice choice for someone's first car. The backseat is very spacious (for a small car) and the trunk has optimal space; I haven't had to fill it up yet but it seems like it'll get about 440 miles per tank, that's such a huge difference! I'm averaging about 35-40 mpg only city driving, thats in comparison to 12-13 mpg. so it definitely benefits my budget. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this for MPG but got so much more. Great stereo also plays MP3. I am getting 37 city & 46 highway because I drive really S L O W. If I wanted to, I could cruise at 80 miles per hour in silence & comfort & still get great MPG. Absolutely nothing to complain about after 4 months. Quality of construction is like a Rolex. I am so lucky to save so much money with the purchase & mileage. I expect for gas to hit $6 per gallon or more & I am so lucky to be ready.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Yaris climbs our bluffs at a respectible 60 mph. Then again, I didn't expect a 1.5L to boil tires. My thoughts regarding room in the Yaris. I am 6'2" and 320 pounds. Nuff said on that. My Yaris is a blast to drive on our back roads. Other owners smile and wave at you when they go by. It has been a long time since I've owned a car that I liked as much as the Yaris. I will recommend to any one, try this little "sports" car. Mileage to date, 29.76 city and 42.36 highway. And it doesn't even have 400 miles on it yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Until I got to the dealership, I had never heard of a Yaris. 2 hours and much test driving later, I would not have bought anything else! The interior space and comfort are incredible for this size of vehicle. I love the extra room with the fold down rear seat. Better gas mileage was my ultimate goal. After feeding a Trailblazer every 5 or 6 days I am looking forward to seeing the gas pumps 2 times per month! Excellent vehicle that I have an will continue to recommend!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I saw this car and I immediately fell in love with it just because of the looks. I got online and I saw how amazing the gas mileage is. I get around 38 MPG. It's a very comfortable car, so fun to drive. Great for the economy and handles like a dream. You can fit into any spot in a parking lot, and I have had it for about 4 months and it's still perfect. I have had no problems with it. It's very roomy, not how you would think because it's a small car. I just test drove it and then I knew that I was hooked.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love how it has soooo much room that you would not normally think it would. I love the MP3 player jack. The sound system is amazing! I prefer the automatic version. I love how it is sporty looking, I love the dash on the drivers side, and the cupholder, and I love how it has the gauge in the middle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We filled it up for the first time in the two weeks we have had it and average getting 37 mpg, mostly city driving. Fun to drive, handles easily. I suggest DRL on all vehicles and a little better seat quality on Yaris, but what can I expect at this price point. My husband and I cannot decide who gets to drive it. We both love it. I think the radio sounds great. Cup holders are fine for summer because I drink iced tea. Lots of storage places. Needs one extra 12v outlet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased my new car and I love it . I have always loved smaller cars vs big suvs. This car is so fun to drive it handles so well. It is comfortable and can comfortably seat four average size to five adults. Trunk space looks decieving on the outside of the car but was much bigger then my mitsubishi eclipse. This is just a great car I had drove 100 miles and my fuel gauge still hadnt moved off of full. You can not beat this car for the price. And it is friendly to the environment passing all emissions standards. I drive by big old suvs and truck at the gas station and realize this was such a great decision to buy this car. I have absolutely no regrets and would tell my family to buy it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car! I'm getting 36 mpg city and 42 hwy so far. I just moved and was amazed at how much I could stuff into the hatchback. After reading the 'expert' reviews on this car, I was a little worried, but I went in for a test drive anyway. Handling is great, and it accelerates faster than I expected (manual transmission). It's nimble around turns and quick stops are no problem. The stereo is much better than I expected. I thought I'd miss power windows and locks, but it's really been no big deal. I'm pretty picky about cars, but I have no complaints. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I actually have the 5 door hatchback!! Our van was falling apart so we replaced our gas guzzling 2000 Venture van with the Yaris, and we wish we had done it earlier! The interior is clean & simple. The car is fun to drive! The many compartments are awesome & I really like the cup holders, they are easy to grab and sip. I drive each day and we really needed something that is easy on the gas, which this is. To me the Yaris is the real "smart car"... great on fuel & seats 5 people!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent gas mileage!! Love the storage compartments, back windows roll down all the way. All you have to do to start the engine is twist the key to "start" and it starts on its own. Very easy to park, very roomy for a compact, includes a cargo cover, other automakers has that as an option.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has completely met my expectations. I love the body style and exterior design. It is very roomy inside (I am 6'2" / 210 lbs and fit perfectly inside). The gas mileage is great. The lowest I have ever gotten is 37mpg but I am averaging about 40mpg most of the time. I thought I was not going to feel safe inside of such a small car, but I was wrong. I feel really safe. The only bad thing about it is that is really light so the car gets shaken by the wind if it is too windy. However, as long as you keep both hands on the wheel, there's nothing to worry about.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car for the $$. Tons of great features with Toyota's rep for quality. Xlnt int and ext styling. Gets good mpg, but less than expected @ 35 avg (likely due to 75mph hwy speed- my fault, I know). But it's "pep" means mpg are wasted with high rpm. A better 5th or added 6th gear would increase the mpg without killing the power. Lack of cruise control option stinks. I commute 150 miles/day @ 90% hwy. No CC means focus is on speedo not the road. Also drops mpg. Auto daytime dash & headlights without auto daytime tailights is dumb & dangerous. As day turns to night while driving, you have to "remember" to turn on the (tail)lights. Almost rear-ended. Also pulled over by CHP.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hatchback has "double-take" looks & styling, especially from the front. Great engine. Impressive handling & brakes. Endless storage compartments & drink holders. Driver's glove box rules. Seat & door fabric pattern is awesome! Comfortable seats. Big doors. Long life-expectancy & A++ resale value.</FAVORITE>

I love the performance of the car, but what I really LOVE is the gas mileage. 117 miles and the bar finally went down once from full. It is very comfortable and fun to drive.

<TEXT>I just bought my Yaris 2dr to avoid the high gas prices and am thrilled to date. I have put 800 miles on the vehicle so far and have averaged 35+ mpg in mixed driving (25% city/75% hwy). I am 6'4", 280 and have more than enough room, actually pretty comfortable for a car in this class. As a matter of fact it is really roomy in front as a friend (my size) and I commuted around the DC area running errands and found it surpisingly comfortable for two guys our size. The Yaris does exactly what I asked of it, great mpg, more than adequate comfort; throw in snappy performance and easy driving and I am thrilled.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This zippy little car has totally exceeded my expectations. Its got phenomenal gas mileage- almost as good as my inl-aws hybrid civic, and for half what they paid for it, so really its a better deal. Way bigger inside than it looks, really attractive body style (I especially love the front, it seems to smile at me whenever I walk out to it), and it doesn't feel or sound like a tin can which is often the case which cheap cars. It feels like a much more expensive car. It took me about a day to get used to the center gauges- now I prefer them, and about a week before I realized I could simply shut off the vent in front of the cupholder if it was making my hot drinks cold (duh, I know). Go Yaris!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>fuel economy, full LATCH carseat system, seatbelt alarm (it bothers people so I don't have to), Aux jack, peppiness, STYLING!, roominess,etc. Just keep in mind this is not a Lexus or a Ferrari- it lacks certain elements of either, however it is way better than it should be for the price.

<TEXT>Good all around car. It gets good mpg in the city. I like the low cost of ownership as well. It has a slightly asthmatic sound when driven at only 30%. I think the car should keep the low weight but get the 1.8 from the scion xd/corolla. This would give it a more acceptable rate of freeway merging. The interior finish seems kind of cheap although better than the Chevy Aveo. And the rear defrost must be switched off manually, sort of annoying. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, I've only had the Yaris for about 3 weeks, but so far so good. It has great interior room, handles well, and has good power for a 1.5L engine. The gas mileage is really good as after 4 fill-ups I'm averaging about 34-35 mpg. Most of my driving is highway and the Yaris has no problem going highway speeds and has plenty of acceleration to get up I-70 in the mountains outside on Denver. Given the looks, performance, comfort, and gas mileage that I'm getting for the price I paid, this car was an unbelieveable deal.</TEXT>

I see this vehicle lasting many years. It's fits any liftstyle, I'm single with no kids and I think its very stylish, but it also has room for a few car seats should I decide to upgrade in that area soon! If you want a reliable, fun to drive, economical, stylish sedan this is it! I recommend the manual drive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 1.5 4 speed engine in this lightweight, low-to-the-ground package has all the get-up n' go you'd ever need for safe driving on a fast highway. Picks up from 75 to 110 w/no problem. Good performance in 3rd & 4th gear. Very little low end (duh). Nice tight turning radius, which is quite a compliment since my other car is a Wrangler. Ergonomics: cozy but I'm baffled by the cup holder behind my steering wheel. I guess I could keep my phone & wallet in there. The flint mica 'S' trim looks tight & will look better with a few inexpensive tricks. 18" chrome rims, 35% window tint & I'm in the air about the bra. That almost-vertical front end is distinctive but it could eat some stones on the hwy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MPG, throttle, brakes, & handling are all responsive in 3rd & 4th gear, noise is pretty low, crs ctrl is peppy & the controls are well positioned, decent trunk space, stereo & speakers sound great, auto tranny is smooth when you shift manually, bright cabin lights, good adjustability on seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently replaced my 05 Saturn Vue with this car. I just like the idea of being able to travel more than 300+ mi. in 11 gallons of gas as opposed to +/- 300 mi. in 16 gallons of gas in my Vue. That is 5 gallons less and 100 more miles. My last fillup, I got 38 mi to a gallon. You can't beat that for a reliable, inexpensive non hybrid fuel efficient car. It drives pretty decent, acceleration from 0-60 is sub par (under 10 sec) but I bought it for it's fuel efficiency in mind. Since I installed an SGII, I am more conscious about how I drive and how much fuel I use. It can be fun to drive with the manual but the automatic is not bad once you got it going.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Essentially, it's fuel efficiency and lowest cost of ownership. It's compact size is perfect for parking in downtown where parking is limited. It's an inexpensive commuter car for people who are tired of paying big bucks in the pump. Now I have more beer money!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My idea of a good vehicle is one you can harmonize with. The Yaris does a pretty good job of that for me providing close to ideal basic transportation. Gets you there fast and does it comfortably at a respectable fuel consumption rate. My biggest disappointment has been no place to hang a couple of clean shirts and pair of slacks. A fairly easy problem to fix but a real annoyance the dealership should have made sure was looked after. Seat belts work better than most cars but you need to make sure they are in place before you begin moving. I've had mine for 6 months and have 23,000 kilometers on it. Nothing has broken and no rattles. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is difficult to keep under the posted speed limit because it is so zippy and responsive at both the throttle and the steering. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this little car. There is more interior space than what it first appears. I had three adult passengers in it last week and all were amazed at the comfort and room. Also the gas mileage is phenomenal! I am getting between 39 and 40 miles per gallon, mixed driving - highway and city. I have no complaints thus far. I've had my Yaris for a month now. It replaced my Saturn Vue V-6 AWD which only got 18 miles per gallon. I am saving a ton of money on gas. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my Yaris for 6 weeks. So far, there are no problems whatsoever. The car is a lot of fun to drive. Due to the variable valve timing, the engine is very flexible. It pulls, no matter what gear you are in or where you are in the rev range. Have no fear about this car being under powered. It is not. It is best described as peppy. The fuel economy is fantastic! I average 33 mpg in city driving and 40 mpg on the highway. I am 6' 2" and find the front seats very comfortable. I really like the center gauges. When I get in a "normal" car, I wonder why the gauges are hidden behind the steering wheel. I love the cute styling. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am going to write this for what it is, one of the least expensive cars on the market. I am really impressed for the price. With the first fill up, got 42 mpg. A/C, AM-FM stereo/CD with MP3 plug in. ABS, 15" wheels, drives nice, plenty of power to weight. I bought a car that is much quieter then my Ranger XLT, gets better mpg then my RAV4 and is fun to drive. Unlike those who want all kinds of standard features, I am happy that they aren't loaded as I had a lot more choice in the price. I understand that I didn't buy a Lexus, I bought an economy car and am very happy with it. I look forward to years of Yaris miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car for fuel mileage and I'm 100% satisfied. Mileage so far has been different every time. Lowest mileage so far was 31 mpg city. City with limited hwy has been around 34-36. My friend told me that I drive really hard but I told him it's the cars fault, it's hard not to not race around in it. So I tried easing up on my "hard driving" and my last mileage check came in at 42 mpg. Maybe he was right or maybe it's just starting to get broken in. Either way the price of gas isn't controlling what I do or where I go like it does with some of my friends. What a great feeling to not have to spend half your paycheck whenever you jump behind the wheel.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really love my Yaris. I had to replace 97 Chavlier and went looking for a truck and bought a 2 door, (3 if you count the hatch), small car. I like the way you can get into the car without feeling you about to sit in a well. I'm only 5 even and that was one selling point is that I could get in and out without fighting gravity. The dealer thought I was crazy when I said that the Yaris had a small "growl" like a Mustang I test droved. I didn't realize till two days later that I had it in Drive 3. Duh.</TEXT>

<TEXT>At first, I wasn't keen about losing my sporty convertible and exchanging it for the Yaris; but gas was a major problem and the Yaris' mileage was the most influential factor for choosing it. However, I love my Yaris! Although it's an economy, four door, I think its bubble look is cute along with the metallic red color I chose. Mileage is amazing! I commute 80 miles every day and find I'm averaging around 40 mpg while dirving 80 mph! I think the stereo is great and highly recommend the power package option. The Yaris responds well for a 1.5L and definitely keeps up with the other cars on speed - it just needs a little oomph at first to pick up speed. This is the best economy car for 2008!</TEXT>

Its only been a few weeks since I purchased but still no compaints, the gas mileage is great, 35 mpg 80% highway 20% city. The interior is roomy and the ride is comfortable.

I drive 122 miles a day, 5 days a week, total of 610 miles per week and I spent $40 on gas the first week on my commute in the Yaris, comparing to my 2004 Audi A6, which I was spending $50 every 2 days, I will probably save about $4,000 or more on gas this year because, last year I spent $6,900 on gas driving my A6 to work. Now that the A6 is parked in the garage I stand the chance of saving extra money on gas. Thanks Toyota. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle for its fuel economy as my daily commuter. I have been getting close to 40MPG regularly as most of my driving in on the highway and that it is going to and from the mountains to Denver every day which means it would suck more gas going up "the hill" where I have to downshift to get more speed. If I was on flat highway I would imagine it would get even HIGHER! I took a road trip to New Mexico with my two children and my husband and it fit us and our small bags without a problem and we got about 39 MPG even driving 80 MPH most of the way. It was as comfortable as our other larger crossover AWD vehicle. I have been very pleased with my purchase. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of room and storage. Excellent fuel economy!! Never gotten below the top 36 MPG listed for highway driving. Plenty of get-up-and-go, never lacking for power! Room - I am a 5'8" female and the room in this vehicle is incredible.</FAVORITE>

All the controls are easy to reach & you have full control of your choices. No computer changing things for you. Feels roomy inside, seats are firm & comfortable - air conditioner vents have full range control. Everything is easy to use & easy to reach. Buy this car for fun, buy it for economy or both.

<TEXT>Very fun to drive. Compact enough to get into any spot and large enough for leg room for all 4 people. Cute bubbly body style. Cup holders are a bit weird because they block the AC, but you can cool your drink, which is really handy, and they are not on the floor by the seats where your purse keeps knocking them over. I took it to the dealer and had the passenger seat belt chime disabled so I can put a backpack on the seat without it going off (very annoying). Gas efficiency is very good. When I use 76 gas, the car gets 5 mpg more than with other gas. Chevron: 35, Arco: 28.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior, leg room, the huge trunk, the folding seats, that you can lay the seats down to almost flat. Turning radius!! Large tires don't affect mpg but give you good mpg still. Driver seat height adjustment. Tall people friendly seats. I also love the knobs for the ac. </FAVORITE>

It did take me a little bit to get used to how to roof was shaped because I felt like I was in a bubble. I like the odometer and everything in the middle because I can see how fast my husband is driving. I would definitely buy another one of these. I can get about 500-600 miles out of a tank (11.1), plus it only takes about thirty bucks to fill up.

<TEXT>Traded in my gas hungry SUV for a blue Toyota Yaris Liftback. Trips to the gas station have not been as many. The little bars that indicate the amount of gas that is left move down very slowly. Inside it does not feel as small as it looks on the outside. The sound system is more than enough and there is even a jack on the lower console to plug in an MP3 player, pretty awesome. The back seat is kept folded down so there is always plenty of cargo space to toss stuff in the back. The engine is fairly quiet for a small car with plenty of pep to make it move in city traffic and on the highway. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an exceptional little car. Nimble, smooth, comfortable and quiet. Peppy at city speeds and adequate on the freeway. Engine noise typical for the class, but road and wind noise are hushed. Front seats very comfortable, though steering wheel a bit too far from driver. Large trunk. Adequate leg room in back seat for a 6-footer. Center gauges not a problem. Stylish interior. We liked the Honda Fit, but thunderous road noise and slow acceleration were deal breakers. Yaris somehow felt more solid and substantial. Professional car reviewers are enthusiasts and write reviews from that perspective. We found many of their complaints to be exaggerated or bogus. Give this car a test drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have to say I was a tad hesitant to buy such a small vehicle, but after having it for a week, I can honestly say it does not feel small at all, either in terms of interior comfort, or the way that it handles and feels on the road. I normally drive cars with manual trans., so switching to an auto had me a little concerned, but in test driving them, I found that the auto seemed a little quieter on the highway. I do not regret the switch to auto at all, in spite of my reservations. The car feels just quick enough to get it where it needs to go (passing, climbing hills etc), and offers great fuel economy. I have filled the tank 3 times, and have averaged about 36mpg 50/50 city/hwy.</TEXT>

The instrument cluster on the center of the dash is great, no looking down through the steering wheel. The hatchback design provides tremendous room for hauling things, with the split seats folded down. It has a high roof line which allows comfort for back seat passengers, truly a 4 person car. I have three other cars and purchased this because I wanted something with good mileage for city driving. Little did I know how smooth and fun this car would be, freeway driving returns 45 mpg and 39 mpg in the city.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted a commuter car as my truck gets 15-16 mpg. My choice was a Honda or Toyota. The Yaris fit the bill. Good fit and finish, turns on a dime, 36-38 mpg around town/freeway and 40+ on freeway driving alone. I figured that in a few years I could drive to work -55miles daily- and purchase a new vehicle with the gas for the same price of just putting gas in my truck and wearing it out. The oil companies will make minimal off my driving. I purchased the arm rest-dealer installed for about $140. This has been great!! worth the money. Car is a blast to drive-co-workers say it reminds them of a remote control toy car. Great value, great car- I've owned other Toyotas.</TEXT>

The higher clearance works great for living in Fargo, ND. So far the handling has been awesome. It's been such a pleasure this winter since it's so reliable, gets so warm, and is overall so much fun to drive. I'm beyond happy with my purchase. I've been raving to everyone I know.</TEXT>

For a subcompact it is very roomy. Handles well and has all the basics. Even without the power package this car satisfies the commuter needs at a fabulous price. I love filling up for 1/2 the cost of my minivan. The sport model gives you a little more in the way of handling. Just a great all around car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned my Yaris liftback for about a week now. Just finished my first tank of gas and got 38 mpg. That is a combination of city and highway. I spent a lot of time researching all the options, including the Civic, Fit, Aveo, and Scion xD. I was mostly looking for a second vehicle that was affordable, reliable, and got exceptional gas mileage. The Yaris, I believe, provides the best combination of these things. Just like every other Yaris, it is made in Japan.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the little nooks and crannies for storage, including 3 glove boxes. Exceptional gas mileage, probably the best gas mileage of any non-hybrid. Manual transmission makes the vehicle rather peppy and fun to drive and offers better mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car just over two weeks ago and wanted to write an initial review. I replaced a Honda Accord because I wanted something smaller for the city and because I wanted better gas mileage. I am really impressed with how safe I feel in this car. It is also very fun to drive - it won't win any drag races, but it's perfect for me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After having several new Toyotas of all sizes, the Yaris 2D Hatch is the most fun to drive. I road tested the competitors and none handled as well, or were rated as high in mileage. This car rides very comfortably and the small turning circle makes it a real pleasure to manuver around in town. I've had mine 6 weeks and average 36 mpg in city only driving. A 300 mile trip on the freeway returned 42 mpg @ 70mph. The interior is very well thought out with lots of cup holders, 3 gloveboxes, & many small storage areas. Mine has the sport seats which have high grade material and are very supportive & comfortable. I could not be happier with my new 2008 Yaris.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Yaris is a dream for long-haul commutes. I get over 40 mpg on the highway, and well over 30 mpg just tooling around town. Although small, I never feel cramped inside, and I love the control of the manual transmission. This car has zip when you need it and is sporty for such an inexpensive car. I commute 50 miles per weekday, and find I am filling up about once every 8-11 days. And that's a $30 fill-up! You can't beat this car for price, economy and style. I love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm only averaging 42 mpg, but that's probably because I haven't been driving to maximize mpg - this car is very zippy, and I can't resist! It's also very maneuverable, with an incredibly tight turning radius. It's also darn cute, like a cross between a VW Beetle and a Camry. Complaint: the transition from park to 1st gear is very jerky (and means I stall out a lot if I'm wearing other than my normal sneakers). I highly recommend the manual transmission with power package and ABS brakes, giving you maximum control over the car. (That way you also get a radio.) This car will last ten years no problem, and will carry me in style all the way.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Aside from the mileage, there's a surprising amount of room, and the driver is sitting up high (better visibility), both of which were unexpected and nice to find. The interior is also much more nicely appointed than I expected.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I needed to buy an economy car and I'd read a lot of good things about the Yaris (I did a lot of car research!), but I was concerned about getting something solid and safe; I didn't want to drive a "tin can". When I finally tried the '08 Yaris sedan, I was happily amazed. Surprisingly solid for an economy car! Has all the extras (side curtain air bags, ABS brakes, power everything) which pushed up the price but still was a great deal. Gas mileage is the best I ever had on a car. I've driven it almost a week and the tank level has barely moved. I'm surprised this car doesn't get more attention.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I find that having the console in the center makes it easier than having to look at it through the wheel! Adapted to it immediately; I don't have to "adjust" to see. Also love: solidness; gas mileage; "good looks" factor; roomy interior and trunk; good quality sound system.</FAVORITE>

From my studies, I severely underestimated this car. I love it to death. I get more than double the gas mileage and I'm hoping that the reliability will be on par with my grandmother's '96 Camry, which has NEVER been in shop for anything but wear and tear. Fun to drive and I love the storage. My buddy bought a 2008 Focus and he says, "I shoulda bought a Yaris" I don't regret the purchase and I can't wait to get it paid off.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is tiny - head-turningly so. People gawk as if it's a toy car. But the interior is so well designed, with many cup-holders, compartments and the hatchback, that I feel as comfortable in it as I did in my 4Runner SUV. It's been years since I had a hatchback, and the accessibility is a wonderful convenience. I have a manual and know how to drive it efficiently. I get between 36-45 mpg, depending on whether the gas station sells 100% gas or an ethanol blend. Can reach anything from the driver's seat except the very back (trunk) part of hatchback. Gets in any parking space. Never had such a convenient, easy access car.</TEXT>

There is nothing fancy or luxurious about this car, and if you rely on your car to impress your fellow man, this is not for you. But, if your desire is to have affordable, economical, and reliable transportation, image be damned, then you want a Toyota Yaris. This car just keeps running, requiring only gasoline and the 5K mile routine maintenance (oil change, tire pressure check, etc. This is an excellent car and I heartily recommend it to anyone who asks. Buy this car, and you too will have a hard time keeping a straight face when passing the Escalade, Hummer saps.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Considering the # of reviews I read before purchase, I feel it is my duty to pass on the word that Toyota has produced a real winner. Although, I'm a very conservative driver, I am getting upwards of 800 kilometres on a single tank! The manual transmission is exceptionally smooth and seems to be a helpful tool during inclement weather. Exterior design is beautiful, perhaps a bit of a head turner, but the interior location of the centre mounted instrument cluster took some getting use to. I wish that cruise control was a factory option as I spend a lot of time on the highway. The car seemed so small when I took delivery, but now, vehicles like I use to drive, seem unnecessarily large.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car for the fuel savings over my old Grand Cherokee. You could say I got a free car out of the deal once you factor in the savings, and not a bad one at that. Tons of space for a small car and fun to drive. I drive this in a mountainous area of Canada which has the highest snow fall in Canada, most years anyway. So it is December and the studded tires are on and the car seems to be fairing quite well. A little noise from the studs but not as much as I thought there would be from a small car. The first gear is a little spongy but actually works well in limiting wheel spin in slippery situations. Other than that, not much wrong with this econ-o-box.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The fuel mileage. With the adequate ground clearance it seems to handle well in the snow, which is why I didn't buy the Civic. My friend gets stuck in her Civic, even with studded tires, to low to the ground. I suspect you will see lots of these in Colorado. I live in a very similar place.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Last fall while gas prices were on the way up I traded my Mazda MPV. I told the salesman I wanted automatic transmission, air conditioning, CD player and great gas mileage at the lowest price possible. He pulled up a Yaris. After a test drive I agreed it fit the bill. Now 1 year later after going thru $4.00 plus per gallon gas prices and rough Michigan roads the car is holding up amazingly well. I consistently get 37-40 miles per gallon, and all I do is get the oil and filter changed at 5000 mile intervals. Now gas prices are under $2.00 per gallon I can fill up for $10.00-$15.00. The car hauls four full size adults in reasonable comfort and we always get comments.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently went car shopping for two cars. My first one was a Nissan Versa hatchback, and the second was the '08 Yaris S type. I got a little carried away with adding things on to it like cruise, a sun roof, tinted windows, etc., and my total came out almost $4,000 more than my brand new Versa. I found that very disheartening, especially since the Versa came stock with cruise and the features I had to add. I was even told that the Yaris S type can not have power doors and locks added on. I find that very hard to believe, but that's what I ended up with. Other than the price being more and the non auto lock/window it's perfect for going around town and a little interstate.</TEXT>

Mine came with 17" mags and wider tires, so my mileage is a little lower; but I did get 35 MPG out of my last tank with mostly highway driving. The car drives nice and is fun, but certain things should come standard and not options, such as power windows and locks. Plus, the numerous gloveboxes should have lights and locks. Otherwise, it is a great commuter car and even with the auto transmission, it has pep! The AC saps some of that as well as gas; but with such a small engine (1.5L) it is to be expected.

The Yaris was the most affordable and I was able to get the options I wanted (i.e. alarm, car starter, ABS, power package). I enjoy driving this car and it is very comfortable for me. The only thing is, this little car can be quite noisy when switching gears and the ABS feel a bit "mushy" for a lack of a better word.

I am 6'2" and about 250# but fit in this vehicle just fine with plenty of head and legroom. I've tested the gas millage and on average city/hwy combined with some AC use it does between 35 and 37 mpg. It provides a comfortable ride, relatively quite interior and smooth going over bumps. 1,500 cc motor is just perfect size for this vehicle. European version is 1,300. The weak spots is lack of power to accelerate on the spot (AT, manual must be better), weak AC, and small trunk area. Amazingly roomy for a small car.</TEXT>

The first day I drove it to work everyone commented on how small it was, then wanted to buy one for themselves when they sat in it. It is SO roomy inside, more roomy than my Civic, and drives very smooth. The body seems solid on the interstate and it hugs the roadway. I was surprised to find how high it sits. There have been many times when I am sitting at a red light and a crossover or SUV pulls up next to me and I am eye level with the driver, and I'm only 5'4". It makes me feel much safer. </TEXT>

For a small 2 door hatchback it has a surprising amount interior room. With the rear 60-40 rear seat down it has a great cargo space in the back. I added a few options for comfort and appearance.

<TEXT>This was my commuter that I bought a few months ago. On the good side I average about 34 MPG with around 70/30 city/highway. Another plus is the design, cute and well made. Unfortunately, the car has quite a few downs... such as the acceleration. It truly feels economy car like. If you really want any type of hustle from this car, you need to darn near floor it. It is also not that great to drive. The small thin wheels and comfort tuned cheap suspension don't make for very exciting backroads adventures. It is decently comfortable for front passengers and has a reasonable amount of space in back. But that driving position is just weird. Bottom line, it makes a good commuter/city car thats it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am so happy with this car!!! There are tons of compartments for storage, and 5 cupholders! There is no front seat console unfortunately, but I found a website where I can get an aftermarket one that will fit my little car. I got the hatchback SPORT edition, and although that wasn't what I initially set out for, I'm so glad I got it! It's so fun, and people are always smiling at it and saying things like "sweet"! The hatchback is great for a single person like me, or just a couple, but if you have kids, the hatchback really isn't as practical as the sedan would be. This car has a lot of pick-up and power, it can climb steep hills with the best of them, especially with that 3rd gear.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's so spacious inside, the passing 3rd gear is awesome and fun and easy to use, and it really gives the car extra power when you need to pass. MPG! I love the extra glove boxes on the drivers and passengers side of the dash board. It's a breeze to park and get out of tight spaces too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I really enjoy our Yaris S 5-speed. The lowest mileage we've gotten is 44 and the highest almost 49. Have driven it nearly 7000 troublefree miles and are impressed with the ride and quietness for such a small relatively inexpensive car. There is plenty of passenger room and the trunk is amazingly large.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my Ford Excursion for this little car. After driving a monster SUV, I find this car to be nimble and quick. It's the only cheap car that a 6'2" man can slip in and out of easily. It's noisy on the freeway but handles well enough that I don't feel I'm in a death trap. I drive on Houston's busy interstate system, even in the rain and my lil' Yaris holds its own which really surprised me! I miss my monster SUV, but hey, get over it! I'm averaging 41 mpg which is almost 4 times better than my Excursion with it guzzling V10 engine. I've gotten lots of compliments and questions from strangers. This car will pay for itself in gas alone. I don't like the "cute car" comments though.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable for a cheap car and GREAT gas mpg. Interior is "different" with speedometer in the center but I like the extra glove box behind the steering wheel. It helps make my economy car seem a little different than the rest of the cars in its class. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought our Yaris to help with commuting back and forth to work which is a 45 mile drive each way. We were using a Durango, which we still have. This vehicle is great with the fit, finish, build, and quality it is like no other!!! I was a GM technician for a long time and have driven every little "Cheese box" under the sun and I tell you this vehicle is no "Cheese box" Toyota really did their home work when they built this vehicle. We bought the lowest priced 4 dr sedan they sell and I love driving it. Gas mileage is 39 mpg when my wife drives it averaging 70-75 mph going down the NYS Thruway and about 34-37 mpg when I drive it, Fun to drive and quiet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I carefully researched this vehicle, comparing consumer reviews, cost, safety, and insurance premiums for the Yaris, Fit and Aveo. The Yaris won "hands-down" and was worth the one month wait for my vehicle. My Yaris is replacing our Ford Escape in my daily commute. I am now driving twice as far on 1/2 the price of gas. There is also plenty of interior space with the versatile seating capability. I packed the car for a trip "north" with golf clubs, gym bags, bike rack, dog and kennel. There was plenty of room to spare. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2008 Yaris sight unseen and never test drove the model. I am pleased with the ride and build quality. This car is not a Camry, but rides remarkably well for a small car. I was surprised at the noise level in the car. I was expecting very noisy, but find the sound level to be tolerable. I have achieved 45 mpg on the highway which is amazing. The car is rated for 37 highway, but I have run thru 2 tanks of gas and registered 44 & 45 mpg. The only secret to my success is driving no faster than 60 mph. The car is quiet enough at that speed and it is also the sweet spot for MPG. If you want great MPG drive this car gently and you won't be disappointed</TEXT>

We've driven almost 200 miles now and still have 3/4 of a tank of gas. Handling is great, and it has a tire pressure monitoring system. Controls are laid out logically and are easy to operate. Air conditioning will put icicles on your nose! The center gauges are different and take a little time to get accustomed to, but are nice. One word of warning, it doesn't feel like you're going 70 mph, so watch your speed. Great overall car with lots of personality.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well I hit the 1000 mile point in two weeks. The car I bought is a bare bones unit with an upgraded radio and cruise control. No power locks or windows. The car has plenty of power to get you down the road. This is not a rocket, but does good. My mileage over rural / highway has been 34.7. I have a heavy foot and my daughter found that she was driving around in 3rd instead of Drive. Very roomy feel in the drivers seat. There are several things that take some getting used to, like the position of the steering wheel. The seats are a bit stiff, but should soften in time. This is a good lower priced car, but it seems demand is driving the price up. Wait to buy when the price comes down.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty European looks. MPG is great over my 4X4. Drives sporty and has a great turning radius. Plenty of room in the back for grown ups to sit. Plenty of cargo room with the seats down. Get up and goes well. No problems driving through Atlanta traffic. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I haven't had so much fun in a car since I owned a cheap European convertible in college. But this car in no way feels cheap. My seats are fabulously comfortable, I love the interior (fantastic fabric & spacious for 5!!), it handles like the little convertible I so dearly loved, and it's as quiet and smooth as any car I've ever owned, including the $27k gas-guzzler it's replacing. I've put 265 city & highway miles on it in 2 days and the tank is half full! Love it, love it, love it!! I call it my little red "Toy"!! It is everything I was looking for. It is the perfect commuter car!</TEXT>

I've seen 80 mph with no problems and it seems pretty peppy for a 1.5 engine. I think I'll get a scan gauge and try to increase my mpg, I have a heavy foot which probably accounts for my lower mph, 33 mph isn't really that low as far as I'm concerned as I was driving a Ford F150.

<TEXT>In 75 to 85 mph on the freeway and a/c on I consistently get 41 to 43+ mpg!! And this is an auto transmission. The very best was two weeks ago in Yellowstone National park. We fueled up in Jackson Hole WY and drove to Moran junction and entered the park and later that night arrived to West Yellowstone Montana. Our speed was between 30 and 50 mph and our mileage was 60.11 mpg!! No a/c, lower speed obviously contributed to the mpg. Three other vehicles in our party and we double checked all of the figures. Before you doubt, please know that I am a pilot and do know how to calculate mpg and a whole lot more. If you want reliability and mpg, go buy the car. You will not regret!</TEXT>

We poked a lot of fun of his Yaris -- mainly because you could fit three of them inside his Suburban -- but then we drove it and thought it was pretty cool. When gas prices started climbing, we went to Toyota to buy either a Prius or the Yaris hatchback (the sedan is ugly). We got the Yaris and we love it. It looks tiny from the outside but when you're inside, it's big! A day after we got it, we put on cool rims. Week later, had the windows tinted. People stop me all the time to ask what it is. Many think it's a SmartCar. I say No, it's a Smarter Car 'cuz it doesn't need premium gas!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 08 Yaris sedan in May after trading in my 01 Mustang. Going from a Mustang to a Yaris was a little scary. But the savings in insurance and gas balanced out the decision. Right now I'm undecided on the Yaris. I love that it's fun to drive and packs a good punch for a car with a 1.5L engine. However, in the month and a half I've had it, it's now been in the shop twice. When the car was 3 weeks old the keyless entry stopped working. Now, after the car shuttered violently, a bearing broke in the AC compressor, causing the AWFUL noise. I got it home, limping. The car was towed yesterday (how embarrassing for my brand new car!) and I'm now waiting for it get done at the shop.. again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really wanted a Toyota because of their resale value and I managed to get this totally bare bones car and does not have any extra features AT ALL, not even power locks or windows. Having said that, I now have a very affordable Toyota that is holding its value, especially with gas prices going up. Gets 36 mpg in the city and over 40 on the highway. The lack of a tachometer has never bothered me. My main concern with the car is that in the winter on snowy roads (we had a doozy here this year) it is like driving a go-kart on ice skates. I plan to get new tires before this winter to see if it helps. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Large opening on the hatchback means I can put bulky items in the back, such as a chair or large plastic bins. People are constantly surprised at how comfortable it is to ride in, even in the back seat. Toyota quality, great gas mileage, and a low monthly payment = nuff said!</FAVORITE>

I average 38 mpg (mixed driving, both city and highway) and have a record of 41 mpg. While not the Yaris is not the quickest accelerator, I do not feel out of pace on the freeway. Not recommended for tall consumers. I am 5'5" and feel that this is the perfect sized car for me. The Corolla feels slightly too big, for comparison. The center gauges do not take long to get used to, and are not as distracting as you would think. Stereo is excellent, storage capacity good for a car of its size.</TEXT>

My only concern is how this car will take the winter and sleet/snow. The S package does come with bigger tires so you do lose some gas mileage but the handling is better. The AC is great. The interior room is plenty. I do give Toyota lots of credit for making a peppy 1.5 16 valve . The Yaris should pass every test possible that my BF will put it through. I look forward to the east coast winter and see if it really is all that. Oh I did add my own GPS and Sirius and tinted the glass. Let's rock this Yaris.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It'll be two weeks tomorrow that I've owned this car. The gas mileage is very good. I got about 380 miles out of the first tank (11.1 gallons) and I think that once I'm more accustomed to it, I'll do a bit better (I had a 94 escort, so this has much better acceleration than I'm used to). It drives better on the interstate than I thought it would with enough passing speed. Turning radius is tight, handling is better than expected and the ride is smooth for a sub-compact. Interior is roomy, I'm 6'2" and have no problem with leg/head room, but it sits me a little too high. The cargo space is amazing for its size, having 3 glove boxes is nice. All around, I'm very pleased.</TEXT>

Keep the tires properly inflated, drive gently, and you'll save a lot on fuel. If only Detroit had the vision to compete with this car, they wouldn't be scambling to dump the huge SUVs. Toyota introduced the Prius eleven years ago, and Detroit is just now realizing that oil is a finite resource.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy better than expected. Electronic power steering. MP3/WMA capable CD player.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my Yaris for about 1 year and a half now, and I LOVE it! Awesome mileage, although the addition of a Turbo would be even more fun. I looked at some competitors, and all things considered, the Yaris was the best bang for the buck! Quiet, *for a sub compact* fun on twisty roads, and super comfortable for someone that's 6' tall like myself. Anyone considering a small car, don't even bother with the competitors. Yaris is it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Awesome turn around. I can snag parking spots easier than most people.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I always had SUVs or mid-size sedans and thought I would never get stuck in a compact as small as the Yaris. I did so, for the mileage only. After driving it for a week, I love it. The stress of paying at the pump is gone. Before my daughter saw the car, she suggested that I get tint, so people wouldn't see me. After I got it, she thought it was pretty cool. I went to a major public event, when I came driving out of the parking lot and my window was down, people walking by started asking me questions, about the car. All the other cars in the lot were Mercedes and BMWs. It seemed as if everyone was more impressed with the Yaris. I haven't paid so little for a vehicle, since 1980.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Yaris is fun to drive. It handles great. Good acceleration. I go 80 without even trying. Everyone who has seen it is impressed. The hatchback is very cool looki Its the best looking small car out there and its environmentally friendly. I feel like I am making a statement driving this car</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Totally shocked by the wicked gas mileage (45 hwy)! No lie! Almost two 20s to fill it for 4 days, unlike former jeep ($100) for four days! Rides like a Go-Kart! Sweet! Currently installing an aircraft mixture knob to lean it for more gas mileage. Haven't calculated yet. Rat rod tires and a shrunken head foe a shifter. I love this car. I have 17000 miles and had no reliability problems. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Awesome gas mileage, inexpensive, MP3 player.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the 2008 Yaris for one reason,gas prices. But I am pleased at the quality of this car. I bought the automatic which has no acceleration problems. This car is fun to drive and comfortable! I love going to the gas station. Have been offered more than I paid for it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this car as a commuter and delivery car for my business. Got to say going from a big crew cab diesel 4x4 to this was a big change. But once I drove it the car feels much bigger than it is inside and out. Brought a smile to my face when I filled up and was getting almost 40 mpg on the first tank. This was driving in the city for deliveries all day and my freeway commute of 70 miles. I like this little car more and more never getting below 36 mpg even got high as 42 mpg! Yes its is basically a throw away car after 5 years but what it saves me in gas for work and my drive, who cares!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage decent ride for a little car. Exterior design</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am very happy with my Yaris. Toyota makes the best car. I have a car that will not only save me gas but also will last for a long time because it is a Toyota:-) Very nice looking interior.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice to drive, cup holders, very comfortable, and the odometer is in the middle, which doesn't distract me when am looking at how fast am going. I also love the cruise control. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This little car may have saved my job, home health aide. Though I get a gas allowance, it no way covers the cost of gas for a Buick LaSabre at about 25 mpg. This Yaris so far gets about 39 mpg on the highway and county roads. I travel about 200-250 weekly. Love my blue Yaris!!!</TEXT>
