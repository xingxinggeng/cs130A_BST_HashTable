<TEXT>We traded my wife's Rodeo for the GV, she wanted something smaller. We spent 2 months researching every SUV on the market. This is a great little suv for the value. Nothing to brag about-just an ordianry suv with limited features. It's perfect for the local driving... </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my GV after having a SX4 for a year. (Loved that little car) But I was too accustomed to a Grand Cherokee for many years! So after convincing hubby I wasn't totally crazy for trading cars, even he has to admit the GV is wonderful. I mainly do city driving, so yes, the gas mileage isn't the greatest, but not the worst either. I have taken it on a few runs to nearby states, and actually got top gas mileage. And I can fit us comfortably in it and we can look good in the new SUV! I too, would like lit features on the steering wheel, and a rear window that opens would have been a big plus! All in all, I'm very happy with the purchase.(we got a great deal by buying year end!).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks great, rides nice, lots of great features!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Being a suzuki owner for the past 6yrs, I didn't hesitate to buy another. I wish I would have looked a little harder though. I got a good deal, but I understand now that my monthly savings on my loan is going straight into the gas tank. Features are missing too... but I didn't miss them until I started reading the other reviews. I didn't mind that the steering wheel buttons didn't light up until I read about it and now it drives me NUTS! I love the size, I can haul a lot inside and tow my camper with no problem. I would recommend to a friend but warn them that gas will kill ya! Nice to read about the K&N Airfilter on the other review, I'll try that! Oh, whats with not having an ipod jack????</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4WD, Comfortable seating, roomy, cool design and so far it's been very reliable... talk to me again when we're in the middle of a MN winter!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the first SUV i have ever bought and so far, i love it! got rid of my van and bought this, i love being able to whip in to parking spaces with so much ease. Handles great on dry roads as well as in the rain. very roomy, great for my family of four. the back door opening like a regular door is great for getting groceries out with the garage door shut, i could not ever do that with the hatchback door on that van! great family car and i love the way it looks!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>style, sunroof, steering wheel buttons for the radio, 6 disc changer, seat warmers, keyless entry and drive....reallly love not having to hunt for my keys in my purse! i love everything about this vehicle so far!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the SGV for its "bring-it-on" performance and it delivers. Nothing can match the looks and the 4-mode drive-- having AWD and low range-is awesome. The SGV is at home in the city or for light off-roading. Its handling, build, safety, fit and finish are at a par with its closest competitors. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Size, appearance, drivability, and of course, The incomparable 4-mode drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The ride is astounding and the features this car has in unreal. Climate control, all time 4wd, anti lock brakes, tire pressure monitoring system and many others. There is plenty of leg room and head room and the ride is so nice and smooth. I did have the front seats altered. As someone said they were uncomfortable and it is an easy fix. In both seats are three steel rods that can be easily removed and when this is done, the seats are just perfect and comfortable. I also had an upholstery man make a 3 inch pad and add it to the center console and this car is a great comfortable ride. Buy the car/truck. You will not be unhappy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I wasn't looking at Suzuki at first to replace our 2004 Honda CRV which was totaled after a accident but after owning and driving the Vitara I am quite impressed with its performance and styling, inside and out. The fwd/rear mounted engine is easy to work on, having low range control is great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Climate control, controllable 4wd, the added fog lamps, v6 engine with 5 speed auto transmission</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Needed a tow-car for the new RV. Not a huge listing of vehicles that can be towed all 4-wheels on the ground. Looked at the Honda CR-V, Saturn VUE and the Grand Vitara. Loved the idea that we could get a 4WD tow vehicle. Inspected all and by far the Suzuki gave us the most goodies for the dollars. I love the smartkey, the streamlined lay-out of the dash, different lighting in console, auto climate control (south Texas gets hot!) Fun to drive, very responsive. Not sure on the reliability yet. Haven't had it long enough to gauge mileage. Know it's not as good as the CR-V, but it has so many more features, we can certainly live with it. Looks to be a great little vehicle! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smart key rocks! Dashboard layout easy. Rides nice and high off the ground. Great responsiveness. Seat heaters! Never knew I'd like them until it hit freezing last night! They're great-good for my arthritic lower back too!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had originally went to dealership to look at SX-4 crossover. Liked it, but wife thought we needed something a little bigger. I agreed, so we decided on the GV. Great driving vehicle to commute to work, great around town and on interstate, easy to park, and holds plenty of stuff. Put in a K&N air filter and averaging around 24 mpg mixed driving. Looked at CRV, RAV 4 and Escape. Went with the Suzuki and thus far no regrets.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior design, steering wheel controls, Smart Key. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the GV for my wife due to the ever rising gas prices and let me be the first to say "We are impressed!" . I never thought I would ever own a Suzuki, but this mid sized SUV has it all. Now if you are looking for V8 power, buy a V8 but the 2.7L V6 has enough power to get ya' down the road. The GV is loaded with extras that most others charge for! We are getting 17/19mpg in the city and we have not taken a road trip yet. I'll report on that later. Can't complain about the handeling or size I am 6' and I have no trouble getting in or outof the GV. Heck, Just go test drive one and see for yourself. The car sold itself! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I never imagined loving my car this much! I absolutely LOVE my car. I would never have purchased a Grand Vitara if my sister didn't work for Suzuki. I was able to get a great deal on the car! I highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a small SUV. It drives great & is extremely comfortable. The features are endless. I am 25 and live in O.C. & anyone who drives my car says the same thing. All my friends want one & the VP of my company said he was definitely going to look into Suzuki SUV's when they purchase their next car. I had never even driven a Suzuki until the day I got mine. I got it becasue of the deal & never imagined loving it this much. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>KEYLESS entry!!! It has changed my life. It's better than TIVO. Being a women & not having to search my purse for my key has made my life SO much easier. So many times I have almost gone crazy looking for my keyes. Now I never have to! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love everything about my Grand Vitara except for the lousy gas mileage. I only get 14-15 MPG in town. Other compact SUVs are far superior in this area. If gas mileage is a primary concern a Rav4, Vue or CR-V would be a better choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far this little truck has been doing a great job for my wife and I. We have taken a few road trips in it now and she performs great. The last trip it was a total of 6 passengers as well as luggage and all fit comfortable within the little truck. Great pick up on the engine smooth shifts just a pleasant drive all around. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The simplicity of driving this vehicle. Easy to park wherever we go good turning radius. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was enamored with the vehicle but now that I've driven it a month in different conditions/road surfaces, I've feel that I overlooked a few things during the purchase phase. The seats are physically hard to get comfortable in. They're designed/built for an anthropometric model of a 5'5" person. Leg room in cockpit seat is cumbersome and your legs go numb on trips lasting 3-4 hours. Controls for the stereo and cruise control on the steering wheel are also awkward to use when not looking directly at them. They're not lighted for nighttime operation... Extremely annoying. The stereo's tinny and rattles when the bass is on 0 & volume on 15. The cloth seats are minimal~go with leather! Good luck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the appearance of the vehicle from the street and the fact that you don't see yourself coming and going around town. Bright headlamps and fog lights; it's like landing a 757! Good nighttime road visibility.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We traded my wife's Murano for the GV, she wanted something smaller. We spent 3 months researching every small SUV on the market. Test drive and features sold us. This is a great suv and a great value. Handeling is marvelous, and the ride is solid. Could use a tad more power. Smart key took some getting used to, but love it now. Everything about this little truck rocks. I want to drive it, and leave my Lincoln in the garage!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather seats, moonroof, looks. A great 4wd system. Great stereo. Center stack is set up really nice. Cargo area is great for a trip to Costco!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It's been a few weeks since i bought it and I already love it. As others, i do have a :( about the Fuel economy but i can't complain since its an SUV. My first one for ever. Its nice, peppy and great interiors. The fuel economy of the new car generally increases within 1-2 months of the purchase. Love the ESP, Tire pressure monitoring, mp3 and great interior. The head lights are similar to new Land rovers and are really bright. I also like the audio controls on the stearing which come standard. It gives me around 20-22 (hwy + city) and 24 hwy yet but i am sure its going to improve a bit after a month. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great interior, MP3, steering mounted audio contols, warranty and free roadside assistance (ask for when you are buying one, saves on insurance) and loaded saftey features and reclining rear seats. </FAVORITE>
