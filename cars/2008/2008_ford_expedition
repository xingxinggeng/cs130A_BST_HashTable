<TEXT>I've owned my 2008 Ford Expedition Limited for just about a year now and have 8k miles on it. For a fully loaded truck with all the toys got a great deal that was significantly cheaper than most competing models. Fuel-economy could be slightly better, but for a large SUV it's sufficient. Don't drive it daily, it's just the family shuttle bus. Extremely comfortable and handles well on highway. 6-speed transmission runs smooth, but takes a second to kick in when you really need to accelerate to pass other vehicles. Needs a little more instant HP "KICK". Cabin reasonably quiet. Kids love wireless headsets. Why pay $10-15K more for the same basic features in GM, Toyota, or Nissan models?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power fold down 3rd seat great for wife loading groceries, or kids' football/baseball practice. Heated/cooled seats great. Adjustable pedals perfect for a 6'2" husband and 5'4" wife. GPS Navigation and DVD is great. I have the 2-tone black/brown leather seats which add a nice touch. Beautiful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my 08 Eddie Bauer after my 02 Explorer bit the dust. Initially, I wanted the Limited, but chose the Eddie because it had the chrome grille and the Limited did not. I LOVE my new truck! Every time I get into it I remark about the comfort. My husband loves it also. The third row folding seats are a godsend. I will continually buy a Ford. I love this truck. I hope they never stop making it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The comfortable seats, running boards, features, navigation system. </FAVORITE>

<FAVORITE>3rd row power folding seats,this was the deciding factor over the Chevy Tahoe. Rear DVD entertainment system is great, with headphones my kids can enjoy their movies and I can enjoy my music.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the way my new Limited Expedition rides, however, I am having problems with the windows. When the driver side is rolled down half way it makes a loud rattling noise. I took it to the dealer to get looked at several times and they said there is nothing they can do and that it is a normal occurance. It seems strange that a SUV of this caliber is suppose to have rattling windows! The Texas Customer Rep. is not trying to help my situation either. I feel like they are trying to sweep this problem under the rug! Is anyone else having this problem?</TEXT>

<TEXT>All I have to say is I'm so glad I got over fear of big SUV's because this one is amazing. I'm 4'10 and I have never had an easier time driving a vehicle, all the ways to adjust make it so easy and comfy to drive. I love how it fits 3 car seats side by side just in the second row alone. I love this car and I am never giving it up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>On my third Expedition. This one is a 2WD EL Limited and I must admit I like it better thatn my others, it has a softer ride, feels heavier and is a little better on gas ( maybe the 6 speed ). Only issues are soft shifts but for 18 mpg hwy I'll deal with it. Hope I can afford to buy it after lease and get the Supercharger and chip</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking at getting an SUV. I went and test drove a new 2008 Expedition XLT model and fell in love with it. It rides great and handles like a car. I bought it the same day. I have been getting 12 MPG around town and 22+ when I drive only freeway miles It comes with many great standard features for a base model and has the same engine and transmission as the Eddie Bauer or Limited versions. I also like the looks of this vehicle a lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>10 months and 2700 miles later I'm impressed with the rock solid, quiet interior, great road manners, surprisingly stable, short braking, and 14/20 MPG. I've owned 3 different Japanese vehicles in the past, but given this massive Ford's decent-for- class mileage and quality, I sure am glad I resisted the inclination to get a Sequoia and pocketed the extra $9,000. This SUV is the hidden gem in the field. Just compare its third row to the equivalent regular wheelbase GM, Rover, Infiniti, and Toyota, and you'll know that Ford's engineers have slaved as hard as their accountants to produce untouchable SUV value. Finally, I find it exudes a strikingly handsome blend of toughness and aristocracy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Expedition and I still love the vehicle. Every time we compare to other SUV's and minivans. For the price and size, you can't beat it. Our last was the 4.6L 2002 model so this was a change for us. While I miss the better gas mileage, we are still getting 17 mpg. With kids, we pack heavy. There's always plenty of room. The new design is boxier than the older style. I liked the older style's exterior better. However, the new interior is much better. The stow-away 3rd seat, and the middle bench that folds in three places is a big improvement. And as much as I miss that better MPG of the 4.6L, I love the power when I hit the gas now. Third Expedition, no complaints!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this truck! After six months, only one small problem(heated and A/C seat module needed replacement). Extremely comfortable ride, better than any car I've owned. Seats are great on a long trip. Tows my 6000 lb. boat with ease. I'm now getting 18 mpg in mostly fast highway driving which is 2 miles better than my '03 V8 AWD Explorer.(10 mpg towing the boat) The turning circle is reasonable given it's size. Acceleration is adaquate. Better ride quality and much better value than Toyota.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride quality, comfort, memory seats, climate control including rear A/C, power liftgate. The rear camera makes hooking up boat trailer a snap! I love that the auto headlights go on when wipers are used (helps comply with my state law). Power rear flip out windows reduce buffeting.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our 2nd Expy and and what an improvement over our 2004. We liked our previous model but this one is so much better. Quiet, smooth ride, better control placement, heavy duty brakes are a huge improvement, back up sensors and more standard features included. Love the Sirius radio, power fold flat seats are so much easier to manage and DVD entertainment system with the 8" screen. The 18" chrome clad wheels look great. Gas mileage isn't great with a vehicle this big but it is improved from our 2004. About 14mpg in city driving so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first Ford I have ever owned and, in fact, the first domestic car since I was a kid. We tested every large SUV from the QX 56, to the Denali and Sequoia. The Expedition was the best priced and best balanced of the entire bunch. The independent rear suspension does make a difference in handling in comparison to the GM Yukon/Tahoe variants. The interior is well thought out and, while there are some rough edges, no where near the interior disaster of the new Toyota Sequoia. If you have a large family and need to tow, this vehicle serves its mission well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Most versatile vehicle we've ever owned. Grand kids get into/out of child seats/3rd seat thanks to 2nd row buckets. Lots of safety features and great sound/dvd/nav system. Haven't taken a long trip yet but look forward to doing so. White Tri-Coat paint and Sand leather interior is great for hot Texas summers. 20" chrome wheels make it the best looking SUV out there Local driving so far has been very comfortable. Commanding seat position and good visibility all around. This is a vehicle we plan to keep for a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 3 Explorers, decided to move up altho I didn't need the size. Probably would have stayed with Explorer if there was power lift gate available. It is very comfortable but given its size it lacks any nimbleness. Pickup is only fair and stopping distance seems excessive. Just took our first long distance drive, 800 miles r/t and got 19.1 on highway which is better than any of the Explorers got. Don't use it for local drives so don't know about mileage. Like the fact that you can buy certain options as stand-alone like rear camera.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As a life long Toyota buyer. I evaluated all the large SUV's and the Lambda platform and chose the Ford Expedition. Here's why: More leg room and thigh support for driver & passenger. Fold flat 2nd & third row seats. Rear ratio of 3.37 gets equal gas milage with the Lambda AWD. I get 15 city / 22 Highway driving the speed limit. It's a quieter ride. (Dual weather stripping) 6 Sp trans that doesn't hunt for gears. 6000 lb tow is 1500 more lbs than the tow package Lamabda. Adjustable pedals. Interior fit and finish is top notch and better equip for less money. Insurance is less. The Expedition is more capable and a better overall value. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Narrowed my search down to new Sequoia and the Expedition based on the fold flat 3rd row seats and need for V8 for towing purposes. After comparing the 2 vehicles, I was able to get a comparibly equipped Expy for 12K less than a Sequoia. And, the Expy has a smooth 6 speed transmission and surprisingly I have 2K miles on it and trip computer is saying 16.4 mpg. Hands down the best bang for the buck in the large SUV segment. Buy it and use the extra $12k savings vs the Sequoia to pay for gas for the next 5 years! Also, settle for the smaller standard tires and you will get better gas mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navi is very easy to use, and still easy to use the radio unlike some vehicles with navi. Rear view camera, DVD system, power t/g, fold out rear side mirrors, fold flat 3rd row seats (a must), very roomy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ordered 4x4 Expo on 1/21/08 and took delivery on 3/11/08 Drove to Lubbock (325 miles) and on 3/21/08 replaced torque converter. On 3/26/08 at 421 miles replaced torque converter and transmission. So far, have not left city limits because of apprehension that it will leave me stranded at the ranch. Selling dealer and repairing dealer have been great. Gave me 2008 pickup to drive while repairs were made. It had only 220 miles on it and I was sure not to exceed 400 miles...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love everything about my Limited. It's the perfect vacation-mobile. The sound system, the ride, comfort, utility, etc. are all excellent. I even put a bike carrier in the hitch receiver and take my sport bike to the track. I really like the copper metallic color too. This is the first vehicle I've ever owned that I can't think of anything I would change. I haven't had even one problem with it (knock on wood). This review almost makes it sound like I work for Ford! I don't.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In the first month of ownership, I have no regrets about my choice. I traded a 2003 Explorer with many problems at 55k miles so I am leasing this one. I enjoy the room (at 6 feet 2, I have lots of head room and extra seat travel both of which the Explorer lacked. The ride quality is excellent, much better than the 2008 Toyota Sequoia I tested, particulary over less than perfect pavement. Power is adaquate although I haven't towed my boat yet. Turning circle is fine for such a large truck. Gas usage is not terrible given it's 5625 lb. As per the trip computer, I an averaging 15.2 on mostly highway compared to 16 on the Explorer. 6 speed transmission very smooth and low revving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power rear liftgate very convenient at the supermarket. Rear view camera in the mirror is great (no need to order expensive navigation system in order to get rear camera unlike competitors). Heated and cooled seats work well. Sirius radio reasonably priced option. Oil and volt gauges.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I gave my Expedition "10" scores throughout for a reason; For a large SUV, one cannot expect to get 25 MPG. I drive the posted speed limit at all times and my average up till now, (only 2100 miles) is 15.6. Considering that I came back to an Expedition from a Honda Pilot, I am thrilled with the gas mileage. Comparing my Pilot which averaged around 19 MPG, I didn't give up that much gas mileage, given the much larger vehicle that the Expedition is. The comfort and ride spells luxury in my book. So far no problems and the dealer is the best I've ever dealt with.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our Limited looks great, gets a lot of compliments and is a very nice vehicle to drive. Big vehicle and you feel very safe but pay in gas mileage, but nothing unexpected, avg for us is about 14.7. Major disappointment has been useable storage space. The front of the vehicle is largely taken up by the center console. There is just one big hole in the armrest and little else. If two people up front you will have stuff tucked under your legs, on your lap etc. especially if you have kids. Back seats not much better, seem like always stuff all over the floor boards. Coming from a T&C minivan the space has been a real issue. Power could be slightly better, but did not expect to drag race!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have liked this new design since it came out for 07. Finally got one early this month. Wish I had done it sooner. 20" wheels really set it off- perfect size in proportion to the size of the vehicle. Truck feels very solid & tight. Very quiet inside. Very comfortable. Heated seats warm lower back in addition to seat bottom. (that was a pleasant surprise!) Brakes feel very strong. Engine feels strong as well. My wife drives it more than me. She absolutely loves it. I'm looking forward to trying out the air conditioned seats next summer as well as the 9200lb towing capacity. -Have a 5200lb boat (8000lbs with trailer, fuel and gear) My old Tahoe was only rated to pull 7000lbs. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This Expy makes our 3rd. A gold XLT witht he 4.6 V-8, an black XLT with the bigger V* and this white 08 XLT. The progression and evolution of these vehicles is remarkable. The 08 is a s good as anything from any other manufacturer, including GMC, Chevy, Toyota, Nissan and Honda...and in fact better than them in many ways. The quality is great, features for the price remarkable, ride and handling not at all what we expected, very smooth, quiet and controlled. The V8, as typical for the Expedition, does not feel as peppy as the sound and horsepower would indicate, but it's a trailer pulling mule! Big and barn like inside, comfortable seats, leg room and head room great. Love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Everything you'd expect in an American full sized SUV. Solidly built, exceptional comfort, surprisingly nimble (especially in parking lots)all at a decent price. Our first choice would have been a Mercedes GL 450 at $64,000. Almost $30,000 more than the XLT, and the XLT was far more comfortable. The only problem with the XLT is the poor MPG. 13.5 MPG for an average is not unexpected, just getting to be expensive. 19 MPG on the highway is OK, but not good enough. With that said, overall our family loves this truck. Comfort, safety and quality sums it up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Seriously, how do you rate this as "fun to drive"? It's as big as a boat. That's why I bought it though. It gets lously mileage. I knew that up front. You'll not get more than 14 with the 4wd. But no other SUV (other than the new Sequoia) will have as much leg room and be as comfortable. The specs on the Tahoe look comparable but if you actually sit in one you'll wonder what kind of ruler they were using. The 3rd row is useless and the 2nd row is still tight. I wanted room. Besides the Expo has absolutely the most non-truck looking interior of them all (at least in the under $50K line) I tried not to go back but saw no compariable options out there for ride, comfort and usability.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Ford Leasing sold me! I can lease it and later buy it for less than buying it now due to the low lease rate. If gas prices are high I can walk away from it in two years. GM's rate was not comparable. Air Conditioned seats rule. Flat folding 3rd row makes this the king of large SUV's!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just recently bought a brand new '08 Expedition Eddie Bauer. It is my best SUV so far. The back-up camera and GPS systems are excellent. The new 6-speed tranny is also smooth and powerful. I used to own a '05 Expedition and was about to buy a Tahoe until I noticed that the Tahoe had absolutely no legroom, and used a '90s 4-speed tranny. Then I saw the new Expedition and fell in love with it. Not only does the new Expedition feel good, but it's fun to drive. The fuel economy has also improved from the previous generation. It is my new favorite in my driveway.</TEXT>
