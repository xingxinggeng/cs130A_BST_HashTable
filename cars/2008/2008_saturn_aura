<TEXT>I've had my Saturn for about 3 months and so far have loved every minute! My 4yr old and 2yr old fit perfectly in the backseat with their carseats. I am disappointed we couldn't find this car in our price range that had leather because the cloth seats are already showing wear and one drop of water makes it look like a ugly stain. It rides smooth at 75mph and my highway mpg is 31 and my city mpg is 26-27.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The look - Very hot! XM radio is nice and the car is very roomy - fits my 2 children perfectly.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Now that I have had the car for a while, I can now say I am more than pleased with it. I have discovered that using semi-synthetic oil helps a bit with gas mileage, as does putting better tires on the car. Now getting 22 mpg in town and 34 on the highway. Better than with regular oil. The ride, quiet and handling are vastly better with Continental 225/50/17 DWS tires than the OEM ones. All in all, a lot of bang for the buck. Too bad they are going away. I'll be driving mine into the ground since it works so well for my needs. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The XE6 with sunroof and power driver seat has all the right stuff to make the car a comfortable and great handling travelling car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT> I have owned this car since 01/08 and bought it new. i am extremely happy with it in everyway. it rides as smooth as all of the other cars that i looked at in the $40 to $50,000 ranges and looks just as nice if not better. I have had hundreds of people looking at it and asking what kind of car it was and who made it because of it's beauty. I am especially impressed with it's smoothness and gas miledge. others may have rated this Saturn low but as for me two thumbs up Saturn.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This has been one of the worst cars I've ever owned!! Major electronic issues -(blows fuses, radio speakers quit working randomly, none of the onboard computer info works properly, alarm goes off without being set) - Transmission - will not downshift normally, ex: must hold throttle completely to floor on a hill as car will be in 4th gear at 800rpms, will shift in neutral (while in drive), redline, then downshift to 2nd gear, car takes off backwards while on any slight hill as if it were in neutral - Horrible gas mileage (11-14 mpg) - Dealership is horrible...they always tell me there's nothing wrong, its completely normal for these things to happen & it's too complicated for them to explain.</TEXT>

So far my only complaint is the key fob failed to function properly and had to be replaced by dealer. If Saturn continues to around ,I will buy another and I hope it does </TEXT>

<TEXT>XEV6 has the right stuff to make it nice to drive. Amazing ride and performance but gas mileage not much better than a 1998 DeVille. For my tastes and budget it's a CTS at a Chevy price and better looking to boot. Multiadjustable power driver's seat is a must for taller drivers. A/C system is pretty much useless on hot days or if the car has been sitting in the sun for a while. Takes quite a while to cool down, even at the maximum cooling settings. Saturn dealer says this is normal. I guess I'm just spoiled from driving Cadillacs for 25 years. Now if Cadillac could make their cars as reliable as the XEV6, they'd really have something.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cargo space with the back seats down is fantastic. Lots of features for the money. Doors open wide for easy access. Remote with illuminated entry and trunk release is great. Styling is spot on overall. Drives like a 3-series BMW but with features of a top model.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I look the style and looks of my Aura. However it rides like a buckboard at around 55 mph. Had it back to the dealer when I frist got it over and over. They were never able to resolve the issue. And the left compartment will not stay closed they also worked on it over and over. I just don't use it. I drive a lot of highway miles 40,000 a year so most times I am over the 55 mph's were the bumpy ride is. Dealership has been a disappointment. I was also a little shocked to see how much value the car had lost in one year. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So far so good. I have owned 2005 VUE for the past 2 years and it seem to be cheaply made, the Aura so far from I can tell is a well built car and worth the $21K, I looked at other cars with the same options that were in the $30K range and not as nice to drive, Saturn has a winner with the Aura. The Aura handle nicely and is very comfortable, seems to have a lot of power with good gas mileage, Very quite car when on the highway doing 80 mph, and big bang for the buck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We had a 2008 Saturn Vue and had problems so I took it back before the 30 day return was up and got an Aura. Best move I ever made on a car. The ride is great and if you turn the track control off you can leave smoke with the tires. Many people think its a Honda. And it cost many thousands less than a Camry. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was hesitant to purchase a Saturn at first until a coworker talked me into visiting the dealership...I'm glad I did. I'm very satisfied with my new car. In two months of ownership I've actually had 2 different people stop me after parking my car so they could ask me about the vehicle (which is a first for me). Anyway, the car is great and I'm very impressed with the performance, styling, features, etc. for the price. It really does seem like it should cost around $10K more. The all around mileage has been decent (around 24.6 mpg) and it has been a joy to drive. Didn?t feel the extra $4K was worth it to go to the XR.. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling - I've never had so many people stare at a car that I bought. Handling - very crisp and effortless. Peformance - Don't think you need the higher priced 6 cylinder engine as this car has more than enough get up and go! Fit and finish - things fit the way they should and looks good doing it</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After test driving the alternatives, the Aura XR blew me away. I was a confirmed Toyota fan but the new Camrys and Avalons did not measure up. The Aura has been a pleasure to drive and the dealer experience great. Only time will tell if longer term reliability will rival the Toyota and Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did a lot of research before buying my Aura XR. I wanted to replace my boring 2005 Accord with something more fun to drive. The Aura did that and far exceeded my expectations. This car is on the same level as the Acura TL not Accords or Camrys. It's quiet, smooth, powerful and loaded with just about every option you'd ever need. This is my first Saturn but I anticipate staying with them for a very long time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This new Saturn did something that I thought would never happen, I bought a Saturn. After trading in my 2003 MINI I have not looked back. The Saturn is more pleasant to drive and certainly has more power. The switches and controls are much more intuitative and are easier to reach. The interior looks and feels like a much more expensive car. The body looks more German (in a good way) than a lot of German cars do. Is it as nice as a loaded 3 series BMW? No it isn?t but at close to 20 thousand dollars less for a comparably equipped car it certainly is a bargain. If you want a sport sedan with a lot of comfort and luxury features at a fair price there is no other choice.</TEXT>

This car is what an American car can and should be. This car is so quiet that you can not hear the windshield wipers working.

<TEXT>We purchased this car for my wife in May of 2008. A life long Honda/Toyota owner, she pursued test driving those makes. Accords, Civics, Corollas, Nissans, she test drove them all, often several times. She came away unsatisfied with all of them for one reason or another (style, driving experience, interior quality.) Then, on the way to test drive yet another Accord (YAWN) she saw an Aura on the road and that was that. The car's beauty, performance, engineering, and price were absolutely second to none. Perfect car. People offer positive comments about the car often...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm about 8000 miles in now. It has great performance. I get compliments on the looks of the car (one lady thought it was a Lincoln MKS). The interior still baffles me. For the most part, it's quiet and comfortable, but the plastics are a bit cheap. The traction control switch is under the armrest, the heated seat buttons are down low on the side of the seat, and the side mirror switches are too far away. These all need to be re-positioned so they are easier to get to. And who still puts an emergency brake pedal on the floor? I had a bad rattle, which ended up being a bad weld on the sunroof bracket. Dealer fixed it under warranty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First let me say that I love this car! It is the first new car that I have purchased and I am so happpy with it! For the most part. It looks great! I love the styling on the exterior and interior. It is fun to drive, responds well and looks way more expensive than it is. I wasn't able to find the color of car with all the features that I wanted so maybe if I did I would give it 100% but as it stands I can really only give it 92%. And here is why. Now depending on what you are used to the interior materials will look cheap or ok. I think the hard plastic looks cheap. And there isn't a gear indicator anywhere. The interior lights are orange which is hard to see when sunlight hits it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks, it turns on a dime and it gets really good gas milage for being a V6 (although the response time could be slightly better. By bf has a Nissan Maxima and I can really tell the difference in the acceleration betwn his V6 and mine). LOVE the safety features! All in all I think it is great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this baby (black with black & gray leather) at an incredible price. I am a GMS customer, and I got$5K rebate and some GM loyalty. But what a car at any price. Quiet and smooth. Love the tap shifting, and it can scoot. Parked next to an $60K Audi S6, also black, and my Saturn got more attention and alot more walk arounds. But what I really like the most is the window sticker that says "Built in Kansas City with 98% USA components". The 3.6 V6 is manufactured at the Tonawanda NY engine plant, that GM spent $400 million renovating in 2000, with good high paying engineering & manufacturing jobs. My first 300 mile trip averaged 30.8 mpg at about 65mph.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After spending 8 years in Volkswagens, I decided to trade my 2005 Passat for the Aura. Overall, I'm impressed with the Aura. Saturn sure has come a long way. Good power (although a little slow to react when you punch it). Little things I notice like some cheap plastics, and poorly fitting panels in the Aura. Especially the door panels, and door sills, which get scuffed very easily. Shouldn't have that at this price point. Seating is not as comfy as the Passat. I'm a taller guy, and trying to get a comfortable driving position has been a challenge. Curious to see what long road trips will be like. If I could have the VW seats in the Aura, it would be perfect. </TEXT>

I have gotten many compliments from coworkers and from people on the street about the new look of Saturn. The experience I have had as an owner has been nothing less than superb! I have scheduled appointments for regular maintenance with various dealerships and everyone has been friendly. The only issue I have had thus far is a remote that worked at its own convenience. At the dealership, the service representative was friendly and swapped my remote while my oil was being changed. I would truly say that this car is a very good buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We absolutely love this car. Our previous vehicle was a Ford Explorer so it's been quite a change. Once all the comparisons were made in this class the Aura impressed us the most.We live in a hilly region so our gas mileage is only about 34 mpg hwy but still twice as high as our old Explorer.We just finished a 10 hour drive on our world famous Cabot Trail and this car stuck to the curves like glue.From a dead stop the 4 cylinder is a bit sluggish (not for the lead footed drivers) but has more than enough power to pass anything on the highway. At over 6 feet tall it is true that getting into this car takes some getting used to but once inside the fit and finish is the best bar none. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the interior and exterior design. Also enjoy the light show on start up as well as the ambient lighting at night. Satellite radio, Onstar, remote start and sunroof are nice touches as well. Another favorite feature of this car is that it is so rare to see one since it is only 2 years old. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Test drove just about all mid size sedans and once I drove the Aura my mind was made up. Great style, profile and roomy interior. To top it all off a V6 getting over 30mpg. Saturn making big mistake not offering 3.5l in 2009 Aura XE. The 3.5l has plenty of power and I have no complaints with the 4 speed automatic transmission. I still can not get over the MPG, a pushrod power plant getting that kind of mileage. Handling is second to none, put all of these factors together and you have one fun sports sedan. You owe it to yourself to at least test drive and you will want one. Then compare price with other mid size sports sedan, you will be sold.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Saturn, the first one was a 1997 SL-1 and I still have it. I bought another Saturn because my first one was an excellent car. I have put almost 6,000 miles on the Aura and it has been smooth sailing all the way. People have asked me if it was a Lexus or Acura. The car rides smooth, handles well and is very quiet. The fake wood on the inside makes it look like a luxury car. The car is Red Jewel Tintcoat and it turns heads. The 4-cylinder has enough power merging onto the freeways as long as you turn off the A/C first. Plenty of power is available for driving around town. Fuel economy is good , 30 MPG on highway. I love this car and would defintely buy it again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving higher-end, foreign vehicles for the past 12 years, I decided to give an American-made car a try. Before I decided on the Saturn Aura, I already tested a Saab 9-3, Mercedes C, Audi A4 and Lexus IS250. The Aura was roomier, quieter, more comfortable and almost as nimble as these much higher priced cars. It's fresh exterior has piqued the interest of many fellow motorists, who have stopped me in parking lots and at the car wash. To a person, folks were very impressed and even more so, when I told them the cost of my XR which is equipped with every available option Saturn offers.My other vehicle is a pricey foreign make yet I get as much a kick from the Aura as I do from it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When I started looking at these, my husband insisted we get a loaded 3.6 XR version. When I came home with the loaded 3.5, he did not even blink an eye. It has a smooth ride and is so darn quiet! Road noise is minimal - the first time we were on an extended highway drive, my husband noted that he could fall asleep it was so quiet...thank goodness I was driving. Acceleration is fabulous, although with today's gas prices, I tend to conserve as much as I can now! I would recommend this car to anyone - and it was fabulous in the snow this winter.

<TEXT>I went from a 02 Acura RL to a new 08 Aura XR which actually has more features and options than the RL or TL for a lot less money. I like the stance and handling of the XR on its 18" wheels. The performance is quick and responsive and I enjoy the paddle shift on the steering wheel. It's a bit tight to enter and exit but maybe that's just for me at 6'5" tall. The insulated glass makes for a very quiet ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall I am very impressed with this vehicle. This is my first experience with Saturn and so far it has been great. Getting 30 or 31 MPG just everyday driving. The OnStar and XM are great. Major selling point for me was the traction and stability control. We previously owned an 03 Hyundai Sonata that performed terribly in the snow. This V6 is very impressive. The inside cabin is very quiet, no wind noise that I can tell, a little road noise, but still a very quiet car. It handles exptremely well and I am very happy with it!</TEXT>

The combination of power, fuel economy, styling is perfect. Plenty of room(I'm 6'2"). The dashboard info and interior accent lighting one would expect on a $10 - $15,000 higher priced car. I love this car so much that this will be the first time I repeat-buy on a vehicle, and I'm a former Honda owner. Move out the way I'm coming to get a 2009 Aura!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my fully loaded Aura XR for $21K. The Cadillac engine is smooth and very responsive. The stiff suspension works well for me. The neighborhood teenage kids have already complemented me for having "one bad car". And these kids won't drive anything but an Audi A4 or a BMW 3 Series. I am truly impressed with my Aura XR.

<TEXT>I needed to replace my wife's 8 year old Maxima. Always liked the looks of the Aura since it came out. With the new GM incentives I decided to take a drive. It is an impressive car in every way. It is smoother and more refined than the Maxima it replaced, the ride is much better and it is much more quiet. It has tons more features and was still $3000 cheaper than the Maxima was eight years ago! I cannot get over how great looking this car is in white.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle this month. Far superior to any foreign label, the ride, handling and performance is superior to anything in its class. An excellent road car that exceeds its EPA fuel economy should alarm all competitors, the smooth ride reminds me of the Cadillac but has the performace of a Corvette with European stying. Forget what you have researched and go Saturn Aura. You really won't be disappointed. By the way this is 5th Saturn I've owned and the best.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a Honda Accord before and I struggled with purchasing a Saturn. I had purchased two other Saturns before for the wife and hated them both but this one has been a pleasant surprise. Smooth quite ride with what I think is preety good gas mileage for a V6 (Avg 25) doing city and highway 50/50. Had one small coolant link since in the first 6 months, which was just an occasional drip. Other then that perfect. Wife always had a hard time with Nav systems but the OnStar has been the perfect solution. I drive it about 80% of the time and the wife uses it when she nees directions. She's got an 07 Honda and just admitted that she likes this better. Time will tell if it's as reliable as a Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my new Aura a month ago. I spend a lot of time in a car (95 mile round trip commute). This car is the most comfortable riding car I have ever owned, and that is from coming out of a 2004 CTS. Ride is very comfortable on the highway and it handles great for a sedan I am currently averaging just over 30 mpg. The sound system (advanced audio) is incredible. Interior noise is almost null. Excellent styling turns heads everywhere I go. This new Aura is definitely the most car for the money in the mid-size sedan segment. With everything that is in it, I would have expected to pay thousands more.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Value - this is by far the best car for the money. Sure you can buy a Toyota or Honda with the same level a reliability, but this has style. And you don't see 30 of them in whenever you look for a parking space. The car drives wonderfully with more than enough power. More power is available with the XR but the XE - V6 is plenty of power. For more spirited performance drop it in I from D. Every guest in my car compliments the design and comfort and thinks it is much more expensive that I paid.

<TEXT>I have had my Aura for 3 months now and I am really enjoying it. The ride is quiet, smooth and comfortable. I got the 4 cyl because of the initial lower price and fuel economy, and I am glad I did. The 4 cyl is smooth and quiet, plus the gas mileage is pretty good for a car of this size. I have been in the habit if getting a new car every 2-3 years because I grow tired of them, but I think this car will change that, I can see myself driving it for a lot longer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My family of 5 bought a 2.4 L Aura. With the 0% deal, it should cost less to buy, own, and drive 100k miles (incl. $5 gas) than a Camry hybrid. Outside, it looks a lot like the Audi A4; even the standard alloy wheels seem to copy those once offered on the Audi A4, a good car to copy. The red exterior with tan cloth and faux wood interior is gorgeous, but some plastic bits are low end. Only the Morocco leather (which you cannot get on the 4 cyl) is better. This car rides smoothly, and is quieter on the road at 70 mph than the 2008 Accord and is about even with the 2008 camry I test drove. It's quick enough for us. The 5 year 100k standard drivetrain warranty should make for low hassle ownership.</TEXT>

Details like quiet and ambient lighting, OnStar all excellent. I have had a lot of trouble with the 19" tires, dealer replaced all of them at least once, and they just cannot seem to get balanced smooth - the car rides crappy at 60MPH or higher, and I have been so disgusted with this that all the good things get overlooked. Its a shame, either the tires or my dealer can't get it right - they say its the way the car was designed-yeah right! GM always designs cars to vibrate at 60MPH</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Saturn Aura has very good pickup and power for a relatively small sedan. All the comments about it being the "poor man's Lexus" are true. Several friends told me that they thought it was a Lexus. I had a Saturn wagon about 10 years ago and loved it, had a very good experience with the car. My take is that Saturn has upgraded their product line with a sporty, dependable line of cars that are popular and fun to drive. The only thing that bugs me about the car is that there appears to be a weird "blind spot" at the right front of the windshield due to the design of the front (windshield) of the car. But maybe this could be offset by adjusting the seat? Overall I love this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great stereo. Holds the road very well. I love all the controls on the steering wheel, especially the information I can get by pressing the "Information" button on the steering wheel.

We drove the XR and found that there was too much torque and HP for our needs. Also, drove the Malibu.

<TEXT>I have been in the market for a new sedan for 6 months. I have been very picky about what to buy, because I tend to drive cars for several years. I drove the new versions of Mercedes C- Class, Accord, Camry, Passat, Saab 9- 3, as well as the TL and a Fusion. I couldn't decide on what I liked best. Then on the way home one day I saw a used TL sitting at a Saturn lot. I pulled in- didn't like it, then saw some promotions on the new Aura. I loved the way the car looked on the outside, but I am also no real fan of Saturn- in the past, they have had some of the ugliest cars on the road. Once I drove it, I knew immediately I would buy it that day. This is, hands down, the best car I have ever bought</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the "get up and go" offered on this car. The exterior looks amazing and the interior finishes are similar to luxury imports.

The lines of the car impressed me, and I liked it's stance on 18" rims and rubber. I decided on a test drive and was again impressed by it's handling, the interior styling, and the available options. The XR had everything and even more than my 2001 Acura RL, including steering wheel paddle shift, adjustable pedals, and a separate rear seat audio system with wireless headphones. I love it so far, now it just needs to match my Acura's reliability. </TEXT>

From the chrome trim rocker panels to the solid closing trunk lid, ambient lighting, trim details, XM radio, smooth shifting, comfortable and supportive seats this car is impressive. The exterior color midnight blue with tan interior and wood trim is awesome for a car in the price category.

The car is very quiet and the ride quality seems European. The stereo system is top notch and the seats are very comfortable. I know they have made some minor changes to address a few issues for the 2008 model year and I hope they continue to do so for the 2009 model year to make this a nearly perfect midsize sedan. Some folks are mad about fuel economy but the sticker said 17/26 for the XR so they should not be surprised. The car is heavy and has 252hp so you cannot expect 25mpg in city driving.</TEXT>

Went for the 4-cyl because of price & MPG (commter car). It has a lot of nice unexpected touches- -the auto-up driver's window, interior "mood lighting", telescoping steering wheel, cargo nets. Wasn't expecting any of that in this level Aura. Interior is very quiet. 6- speaker stereo is above average for a base system. Large trunk. Good power. I really like the styling, one of my top reasons for purchase. It looks more expensive than it is.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Saturn has successfully brought over the German essence of this car. The exterior is very striking - I've recently had a Passast, Audi A4 and Audit allroad. This compares well. The interior is close to these cars but a bit below - see first suggestion below. Fit and finish is so much better than any previous Saturn. Driving on both highway and back roads is a pleasure - good feel,quiet (except standard tires are not so quiet or good and there's maybe 2 aftermarket alternatives). Vision Ok but A pillar is obtrusive. The engine is very strong and works well with tranny. It is definitely a lot of car for the money and if you find the right combo of incentives/rebates it is a steal.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Aura was purchased to commute in and be towed behind our motorhome. The vehicle has excellent acceleration and outstanding road manners. The placement of the controls is well arranged and easily accessible. The caution of buying the first of a model year, albeit earning the Car of the Year Award, certainly holds true in the case of the XR. The large number of problems in almost every system of the vehicle is indicative of getting the care to market before a full shakedown. The issues range from poor rocker panel design to fuel economy much less than competitors. There is no question that these will all be solved in subsequent model years, as is the trend with US Automakers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the best Saturn of the four I've owned. It's fun, sporty, handsome, luxurious, and decent on gas. It rides extremly quiet, and turns heads whereever I go. On the highway, I get about 29MPG, while around town it's more like 20. I don't expect much better than that in this class of car anyway. It's really the same car as the Chev. Malibu, but I really like the look of the Saturn better. Lots of gadgets and toys to play with too. I love the LED light in the cabin, my leather seats, all the safety features and the remote start.

<TEXT>I sold my 2000 Impala and bought the Saturn Aura XE 6cyl. My Impala got 30mpg on the freeway at 70mph. I'm a bit disappointed in the Aura. It's supposed to get 32mph highway. If I keep it at 60 it might get that but who drives 60 anymore? Right now I'm getting about 27mph. Not impressive. I find it hard to get a comfortable temperature with the heater also. Love the XM radio and OnStar and the interior is very nice and comfortable. And I still prefer cloth seats to leather even with the heated seats so wish I had cloth. Very roomy trunk. Good visibility. Good get up and go when passing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar, XM radio and lumbar adjustment.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We parked our red Saturn Aura XR next to a red Lexus ES-350 and could not tell them apart except for some minor trim! Consider saving $7,000 off Invoice with Saturn Aura XR. After 2 months of ownership, we love this car. Nice design overall. Saturn has renewed my faith in American designed and built cars. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort & ease of handling. Good visibility from behind the wheel. Gas pedals and brake adjust to fit driver.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Love My Aura!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I had not even considered Saturn when I started looking for a new car. I saw a great deal in the paper and decided to check it out. I had driven a few other cars, but Saturn really had it all. I also found it to be superior to the similar, newly designed Malibu. It is a surprisingly smooth ride and the heated cloth seats are amazing! With the Aura, I was able to get all the features that I was looking for, at a great price! I would definitely recommend this car if you are searching.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated cloth seats, illuminated door handles, remote start, big sunroof, steering wheel audio and cruise controls, , unique exterior styling, and love the red jewel tint-coat color.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far very plesed! The silence was deafening at first. After driving a BMW I was taken back by the plush quiet ride of this American piece of art. Don't get me wrong German cars are made to drive where as Aura was made to relax and enjoy the ride. If you truly want to be pleased you will love this car. I am getting rave reviews from evrybody that sees it. Generally people are shocked when they learn that it is an American made vehicle not to mention a Saturn. This car is Lexus on the cheap. I have only driven this Aura 1000 miles but, I can tell you Accord Camry, Malibu, Mazda, Mercury, and Ford can not touch this vehicles many attributes! You owe it to yourself, try one. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Design, interior, comfort, price. Looks like an A6, Lexus, and even a Chysler 300 minus the bad attitude. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drove a 93 Acura Legend for 12 years and wanted another Acura but I saw the Aura and fell in love with it. (To me the Acura had a smoother ride; but it had a lot of miles and to expensive to fix up.) The morocan brown leather in the Aura is awesome. Didn't think I wanted the XM radio, was going to get my free 3 months and cancel, but I love the stations, especially the jazz stations. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Its appearance interior and exterior; XM radio, heated seats, roominess.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Buying this car was an accident. I have driven Volvos for 12 years now, and decided to check this car out when shopping. Boy was I surprised - pleasantly. The car is beautiful to look at (if you get past the tail looking like it was caught in vice- grips).18" wheels are beautiful, horsepower very good, interior style, excellent. I had a lot of tire problems - took dealer 10 tires to get rid of roll-out on the Goodyears. Other than that only time will tell. There are some things I would design differently, but all in all this is an amazing American car. Back seat room is great - driver entry is not. Center pillar needs moved back about 3-4" for easier ingress and egress. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall style, OnStar, remote start, just enough chrome accents, handling, horsepower, and love how quiet it is. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had the Saturn for about 6 weeks now and have been quite pleased with all the features. Fuel economy is pretty good for a 6. Road noise is minimal. Heated seats and remote start are a nice add on. Heard several comments, That's a Saturn? Wow</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hands free calling is awsome! Very comfortable ride and handling. It is so quiet. Steering wheel audio controls are well placed as is infor center and cruise control.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My Aura is Deep Blue with Morocco Brown leather interior and it looks like a million bucks! A buddy got a 320CLk Mercedes at the same time and when he saw my Aura and found out what I paid for it he said I got the better deal. I took advantage of Saturns 30 day exchange program as my original purchase was a 2007 Ocean Mist w/black interior car. The dealer swapped it out for my 2008 no problem after owning the first car 3 days. I love the performance and looks of this car! On a recent trip to the desert, it averaged 28 mpg according to the trip computer. I get a lot of compliments from friends and complete strangers alike. My license plate sums it up- GR8AURA!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Classy looks. Deep Blue paint with Morocco Brown leather interior. Roomy back seat, huge trunk big enough for 2 sets of clubs. Performance! Love the paddle shifters</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fit , finish, comfort are all first rate. Better looking than the new Chev. Malabu with a richer more Europeen look. Trying one of these better built American cars was a pleasant experience that costs, nothing. You owe it to yourself to try one of their cars out. I really shouldn't be rating anything at this time as the car is still literally untested. I would advise looking at more informative reviews that can be more helpfull regarding reality versus expectations.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving German cars, Audi, BMW for the last 10 yrs, I was pleasantly surprised when I decided to try last years' Car of the Year, The A4 and TSX are changing next year, so who wants an obsolete car after 6 months, so I took a test drive and was impressed by the power, nice handling, and improvements in the American interior. It's not up to Audi but they are trying and hopefully will continue to evolve. The Tapshifter is fun, the sound system decent, and 6 speed transmission smooth. The Moroccan tan seats are very attractive and make the interior very supple. While some of the European cars are making their styles more angular, the Aura continues the style of the older models.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>18" wheels and rims, Moroccan interior, roominess, power and ride.The metalic black is very attractive with just the right amount of chrome trim in the XR model and remote start.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 1000 miles I'm very happy with my Aura. I compared Camry, Altima, Accord, Milan, and Legacy. The Aura won easily for the best combination of styling, performance, and value. I was very satisfied with the performance of the smaller V6 but wanted to get the dark interior with Moroccan leather which is not available on the XE. Not too crazy about the auto dimming mirrors that keeps me from seeing behind me when I back out of my driveway due to my neighbors porch light. I'm not to keen on the automatic climate control, zero fan speed should mean fan off. It still blows lightly meaning you have to play with the temp setting to avoid getting cooked or frozen). I miss manual controls.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats, styling both inside and out. Good low end torque which allows decent acceleration without needing to rev the snot out of the engine. 29 to 33 highway MPG. Kickin stereo. Excellent handling. smooth, quiet, powerful</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Aura's acceleration is extremely smooth. When I sit in the Aura it makes me feel like I'm surrounded in luxury and its so quiet, Saturn uses Acoustic Laminated Glass to reduce wind and road noise contributing to a very quiet ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The remote mirror adjustment is in the wrong place -- can't sit in final position and adjust mirrors accordingly. Put the compass and temperature in lower left & right of rear-view mirror -- can't see past rear headrests anyway. Heat the thighs - not just center of seat. Can't see any info when manually shifting (the tap shifter is a joke anyway). Can't get to pass- side rear seat storage (why is it recessed?) Itsy bitsy cruise-control and radio buttons and no cruise-control pause. Mirror dimmer doesn't dim enough -- manual would be better. HARD seats very uncomfortable. Wish I hadn't bought this thing -- I hate every one of the 150 miles I travel each day! Feel like I'm getting bed soars.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The tap shifters -- since the car shifts whenever it wants to anyway, I leave the car in Drive, and use the shift buttons to pretend they operate a machine gun like WW1 sopwith camel!</FAVORITE>
