<TEXT>I posted here previously, and now have 2 years on the truck. Only problem was a rattle in exhaust that happened in cold weather. GM replaced the converter and back tailpipe, the best warranty experience I have had. Leer canopy did not increase mileage, but still getting around 20 mpg highway, 18 town. General Ameritrac tires are poor at best. Drove truck on Alcan highway with full load, and it performed great. Love the steering and suspension even on a full load with 55mph tundra waves. Need posi-traction on slick surfaces such as snow, rain or loose gravel. Get it on the 2WD. Overall, this is the best truck I have owned. A great value. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>performance as a truck. Looks great with canopy, hood deflector/window shades, and Bully bars. 20" or 22" wheels make it look "Cool". I can't afford cool. Driving comfort (I am 6'1" 250 lbs) and find the truck very comfortable. LUV the automatic lights....very safe feature in Alaska. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was a little worried about the tires that came with it, but they held up surprisingly well a year later. Leather seating and comfort allows us to take lengthy trips exceeding 6 -9 hours without aches/pains.Initial flapping noise at 60 mph was found to be front windshield plastic trim. We got it replaced. Oh yeah, there is this little thing called GM driveline lash, where there is slop in the differential, between the ring and pinion gears, so you hear a clunk when starting forward after a stop. GM says its normal...I'll keep checking.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cab allows full view over the hood. 5.3L engine has good power and acceleration. Towed a 5000 lb trailer and felt no engine strain in the slightest. Low road noise, so I could carry on a nice conversation. Dual zone AC is NICE!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>nice quiet ride. very smooth. we take the truck for family outings, while the suv sit in the garage. i've learned to drive easy to maximize mileage using afm, but would like it to stay in 4cyl at higher speeds/rpm. average is 17.1 on computer. had one problem with pass lock not locking/unlocking. it was fixed under warranty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Truck is great, for those of you worried about MPG, i got to 13000 and finally started to see much Much better gas mileage. Very happy with the dealer, great looking truck, came with chrome bumper, fender,chrome rims, and its very sporty for a pick up, i love the 8 foot bed, as i can lay a full size queen mattress down in the bed flat. Haven t done any towing but have driven from Orlando to Nashville, and only stopped once, Didn't have any issues doing 65-75mph, just dont go above 75mph as the over drive starts to really hurt mpg. I get on average 400 miles a tank on 30 gallons, not to great or bad for a V6, i love my truck im 6'6 and i can fit in it just fine , GM is still a great company. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice big Side view mirrors standard , not power but i dont change them much, Big steering wheel, turns pretty tight, less than 35'turning radius, Very sturdy, Get the Cargo Management system thrown in on the bed, very handy for tieing down to load bearing points. high off the ground rides very high</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had a water leak in the cab due to improper vent installation from factory, lots of wiring issues from water damage, fuel mgt. system robs power and does improve mpg, truck averaged 18-21 mpg for the first 6-8 months. now averages 15.3 hwy with cruse set at 65mph, 13-14 overall. Previously had a 2004 with 5.3 engine that got 19mpg on hwy at 80,000 miles, 2004 was much stronger hauling hay and a boat, 2008 5.3 runs at 211-212 degrees. Seems too hot for just going down the road empty. I am not convinced GM has improved the truck over previous body style. rear bumper is nothing more than stamped sheet metal, very cheap,</TEXT>

<TEXT>After my first year in the new Silverado I can say I am very pleased. As this is a business truck and I spend a lot of time in it. the ride is fantastic. The 4x4 can't be beat. Great interior although it is lacking in cup holders and storage space. Only one problem so far and that is the stereo. Once the Serious radio was turned off I noticed the radio volume fluctuates horribly as the radio struggles to pick up the digital radio transmission. This is not due to the auto volume adjust option. Just poor radio design. It is so bad that if I don't have a CD to listen to, the radio is turned off. Wished it had a non-satellite radio. Back to dealership 3x on this issue.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was a little disappointed in the fact that I have serious lack of options on this model, but after comparing other crew cab trucks for the same price I realize I have more. The Dodge Ram would have been my other choice, but I have some full sized kids to tote along with other work related items. Performance is decent the engine responds well in a pinch. The ride is smooth, only second to the Ford F-150 (and I've test driven all the competition). I've put 2500 miles on it in 2 weeks...and I have filled it up no less than 10 times...so the gas mileage stinks, but hey...it's a truck! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased two new GM vehicles in 2008, a Cadillac STS AWD and a Silverado 1500 LTZ 4WD. The quality of workmanship was the best I've every seen in my 62 years. 0 defects, good fitment, quality throughout. As good over better than any foreign car or truck I've every been exposed to. Thinks I, "They've finally got it right". </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great quality of manufacture, smooth ride, very comfortably. 6.0 VMax engine has great power for pulling some pretty good loads up Casper Mountain switchbacks. After 1 3/4 years of fairly hard use, I have found NO defects, NONE. Including Japanese it is the best quality 1/2 ton pickup I have drive</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My lease was up on my 06 Z-71 LT3 truck in October 08, so I decided to buy the new 08 for about $2500 more than it would have cost to buy the 06 off of the lease. Wow! What a huge difference a redesign can make. Same basic powertrain, but 5.3 now with flex fuel, same 4L60, but I am almost sure that GM has stopped using that junk rear end supplier that plagued the previous body truck. They claim the new truck is 146% stronger in the frame, and I would say that much and more. I like the Active Fuel Management, but it doesn't seem to work above 70, or on an incline of any sort whatsoever. Overall A+ </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>More intuitive audio controls on wheel, better HVAC (dual) system. New body 3.73 gears just feel stronger and don't have the lock/unlock issues of previous generation.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this truck for its great looks and big bed. I have had many Chevy trucks in the past but this is the best by far. Drives like a big car and rides like one. Pulls a car trailer with a car on it like nothing is behind it, and it is the 4.3 v6. Love the rack steering. Wish it had a grab handle on the drivers side so I wouldn't have to grab the steering wheel to enter the cab. Don't care much for the black cloth on the seats. Shows my cat's hair.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the truck on Jan 5th, 09. Last day of the Red tag price. It has the heavy duty chrome grille with chrome mesh, chrome mirror caps, wheels, door and tailgate handles, carpet with all weather floor mat, cargo management system, window and bug deflector, plus deep tinted glasses and a color matched OEM hard Tonneau cover which made by fiberglass. All the chrome makes the truck looks really sharp. The manager accepted my $15000 offer, then I used $1500 GM cash to bring the price down to $13500. The MSRP was over $26000 included Tonneau cover. The truck is nice, but it would nicer if it has a V8. My co-workers didn't believe the price until they see the receipt. Overall, I am satisfied</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system with MP3 is nice. Second row leg room is big compare with other brand. Tonneau cover's design also match with hood. I highly suggest to get a OEM tonneau cover. $8000 rebate plus reg tag price, and $1500 GM card cash reward made a sweet deal. Ride is comfortable and quality is good. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wanted a dependable work or play truck and got exactly what I was looking for. Purchased a 2008 (4.3 / Auto) with LS package (chrome bumpers and wheels), locking rear, keyless, carpet, cruise and A/C for around $13,500 (Original sticker $20,850). I couldn't find a used truck with those features for that kind of price. Getting mileage as promised (17-18 combined) Everything in the engine compartment is easy to access. Very pleased with the truck. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck has been fantastic! I test drove many different vehicles before deciding on the Chevy. My wife and I do lots of research before even going to look at vehicles and really can't believe someone would purchase anything but a Chevy(GMC). The engine (5.3L) is really good on gas and provides loads of horsepower. The ride feels very firm and the truck's standard features are great! My buddy's Ridgeline (that he bought a week before my purchase) is a lesser truck in all areas. He regrets his purchase after riding in mine. I haven't used to roadside assistance but am happy to have it. My advice... Before buying anything else- go drive a Chevy and you will buy it. Best truck ever! This truck is perfect in all areas. Make sure you buy the 5.3 L so you can get great gas mileage and still smoke the tires. Buy the level of truck that you want. The LT1 package was good for me. Rails are a good investment.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas miser, yet power brute! Firm handling and smooth ride. On Star is great and I love my 20" rims. I still can't believe more people aren't fighting to buy this truck! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only had the 6.0 for a bit over a month and love it! Got the 6.0 trailering package to tow for Moab, but fell in love with the power and comfort! The LT doesn't have the leather and heated seats, washers, etc., of the LTZ, but with a remote start, who really needs that? And for 8 grand more than I paid, I sure don't! Ride is great for a truck, better than most cars! Interior is far superior to Ford or Toyota - which I considered as well. Gas mileage is not that great. I've been averaging around 12-14 for the past month, but my foot is a bit heavy with this new toy! And I don't do much freeway driving yet. Overall, A great vehicle for 15000 under invoice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Several annoying features that detract from an otherwise solid design. (1) Steering wheel too far forward. You really have to slide forward to get a comfortable position thereby placing your knees very close to the lower dash. (2) No locking fuel filler door. (3) No grab handle for the driver. GM uses the weak excuse that a wiring harness goes up the driver side pillar. (4) Poor design lower dash trim panel (closest to your knees) that protudes rearward instead of forward further reducing leg room. (5) Poor radio control placement. The most used knob, the one to change stations is on the far right. This makes a long reach. Should have been on the left of the radio.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The tailgate has about 2 inches near the top on each side where it is gapped and lets in snow, slop and salt. Very poor design. Also, cab leaves little room behind the seats for storage. Front suspension is noisy and causes a flutter when driving. Had it back two times and dealership cannot solve the problem. Appears the front suspension system leaves alot to be desired. Nowhere close to the quality of my 1997 Chevrolet K1500 4x4. Rather disappointed with the quality for a General Motors product. 17 inch tires made by Goodyear are not as smooth as my previous truck 16 inch Dunlop tires. Bench seat was much better since the center seat is too far forward for an adult to sit comfortably. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one great truck, I looked at the Toyota but it was no comparison to the Chevrolet. The styling and handling are great. The LTZ is loaded feels like a Cadillac not a truck. We took it down to Bristol this summer and the mileage was better then expected (22-24mpg). Finally drove it in the snow and the stability control and ABS are great, my wife loves these safety features.</TEXT>

<TEXT>LTZ Z71 Crew Cab is the way to go! So far, I am averaging 17.9mpg with 12k miles of driving in all conditions. I love pretty much everything about this truck and I haven't had to take it in for any warranty work yet! the only thing I can say need improvemnts are the roof height if you get a sunroof. I am 6'2" and sometimes I my head brushes the roof. Annoying as heck. Also, the rear bumper is worthless in the new trucks. I was bumped in the rear left corner. With the old truck, I wouldn't have had any damage at all. However, the bumper on the new truck folded right in and the side panel crushed. $1500 to repair! The lady hardly touched me!</TEXT>

I purchased the truck with all the goodies to include, 5.3 v- 8 flexfuel, dvd, leather, the works. All still work well, I only wish the 5.3 had a little more power or I should have gotten the 6.0 v-8. But when gas was 4 bucks a gallon I was glad for the 5.3. I only wish I held out for the 6 speed auto. The 4 speed is nicely matched, but there are times when an other gear would greatly help expolite the power of the 5.3. </TEXT>

I have the 6.0 MAX in it, skid plates, stabilitrack, max towing package, aux tranny and oil coolers with the KN2 option. Love this truck. Not my first Silverado, but the best so far! Only thing lacking on this vehicle is the NAV system. Wish I had opted for it. XM is great, but it has very poor ability to receive local AM/FM bradcasts with its antenna design. I am going to the shop this week and see what can be done to improve local radio reception. There must be another digital antenna with a 2 1/2" mast molded into it.

I've read where the new truck is worlds better than the old but I can't tell it. Both are great handling, comfortable and well built. I wasn't sold on the looks of the 2008 model but its growing on me, especially in Ruby red. The interior is very nice and comfortable and it also has the dual climate zones which we loved in the old truck. The XM radio feature is a nice change and I like knowing OnStar is there for emergencies. My insurance premium went down also. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a 2008 Regular Cab Z71, 5.3L V8, Flex Fuel and AFM, 3.42 gears and all of the interior trimmings you can get. I got an amazing deal, $7500 cash back! I cannot even begin to explain how great this truck is. I love it! It's so sharp and the drive is so smooth and turning radius is very tight. I am so glad that I bought this truck. The secret to the AFM is to use the V8 to get to your speed (55 to 65 is the "sweet spot"), let off the gas slightly until the V4 kicks in then gently back on the gas and hold it to the next hill and repeat. You will see that you maintain the same speed and get 40+ MPG expressway. Learn when to get off it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This whole truck is just beautiful. I love all of the LT1 Convenience features like the steering wheel controls, the remote starter, under seat storage, playing with the AFM, it's huge inside too for 2 door.

<TEXT>Just bought this truck to replace my 15 year old Chevy Silverado half-ton pickup. Got the LT1 package with 5.3L V8. First trip had 19 mpg with combined city and highway. In just the city, it seems to only get about 11 mpg. The truck is very quiet and rides well. So far, I'm quite pleased. Pricing was good in Sept with the GM employee discount and additional 5K discount. Also got $1800 off with my GM card savings and I qualified for an additional GM company card bonus of $500.

<TEXT>Nice design of the new body style. Very comfortable as well. But, why oh why has GM made the 1/2 ton trucks so low to the ground. Had to put a 2.5" leveling kit in the front to take that nose dive out of the front end. Also, they made a change in the steering that is way too responsive. The slightest little movement and you're going off into the next lane which does get very scarry with any hiway traffic. They put the radio controls a little out of reach so changing the station on the radio has become a frightening situation. The old steering response in my 2002 2500HD was great and a more relaxing drive. Now it's more of a stressed drive than before. Why can't a good thing be left alone.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 5.3 is a very peppy engine and the fuel economy is not as good as GM boasts but 17 combined in a pickup truck I can't complain about. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Born into a "Bow Tie" only family and being the first to purchase a Honda due to lack of confidence in any American segment, I can now honestly say, Chevy has learned! I feel confident in the truck's performance, comfortable with better build qualities inside, and safe. 15000mi and not a problem (Honda CR-V blew up its A/C unit at 14000 and power window problems never stopped). OnStar is a great feature I feel should be on every car, not just GM (needs to be cheaper). Rear-ended by a Camry (crushed its front end, nothing to the truck) and an F-150 (crushed its front end and fender, bumper damage to my truck). Best fuel mileage for a 5.3L compared to others. Great truck!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet inside but beautiful exhaust note from the factory outside. Interior layout. Looks sexy but tough. Girlfriend is afraid to drive it. Good fuel economy (comparatively speaking - it is still a truck) 14/19 sticker but more like 14.5/22 actual when driven conservatively.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned three Silverados so far..1995, 2000, 2004SS, and my new 2008 is far superior. The options that are available are excellent. I opted for the extended cab LT2 package with the Texas Edition upgrade which includes fog lights, special 20" rims, and cargo management system. Stickered for $33,000. Out the door with gap insurance and extended warranty I paid $23,480. Thanks to employee pricing of course. If you have your doubts, just test drive one...there is a reason people refer to the Silverado as the Cadillac of trucks.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Integrated trailer brake controller, power sliding rear window, fuel management system, super comfortable. Cargo Management System is a must. Great looks!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned several Fords and just traded a 2004 Ram hemi for the Silverado. Very happy so far, averaging 19.1 mpg after the 1st 1K miles. Not sure what took me so long to get the Silverado. I bought the 2 wheel drive model due to all of the hiway I drive. Everyone thinks it looks like a 4 wheel drive. It came with traction control, should be fine in winter. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My first pickup in 12 years but have been GM fan for 10 (was Ford). As with my previous Tahoe this is a well built truck. In & out looks great. Ride is somewhat more truck than my Tahoe. Engine run and road noise is great except for tire noise but that's due to the dueler tires on when purchased. Already better gas mileage according to the computer than my 03 Tahoe.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My previous truck was a 2004 Nissan Titan SE model 2 wheel drive crew cab. I bought the Chevrolet because I wanted a four wheel drive. I was averaging about 15 mpg in the Titan.

<TEXT>Drove a 93 Toyota 4x4 Ext. cab I bought new for 15 years (200k) & loved it. Was planning on a new Tundra, researched all the 1500s & Silverado is hands down the best. 5600 miles since 4/7/08, runs like a fine watch, quiet and smooth. If I take it easy 17-18 mpg in city with some freeway, 20-22 on the hwy on the DIC. You can drop 1-1.5 mpg off the DIC mileage & be close. If you get into the torque, goodbye mileage. You can be a hyper-miler if you watch the DIC, learn when to coast on your daily drives, and save your brakes & dollars. I don't have any major complaints, it is as reviewed by many here. I have Z71, wanted Z85 w/6-spd tran. but they ship mostly Z71 on lot. I'll drive it 15+ & like it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my truck for 7 months, and I like it ok, but it's not as good as previous Silverado models. First, the fuel economy is terrible for a V6, and it's not responsive enough. Next, the truck has a tremendous amount of wind noise at 50 mph or higher. The ride is way too firm, even for a 4WD. Also, I think the truck is geared way too high. So if you buy one, then definitely get a V8. The seats in this particular model are not very comfortable either. You just about have to get the higher end model to experience the comfort & quality of these trucks. I like Chevrolet better than Ford, but they sometimes leave things off their vehicles that just don't make sense. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Great truck, by far much better that the 2006 2500 HD 4WD gas guzzling machine I traded in. Not sure what the active fuel management is, however after the purchase process on the long journey home over a 100 miles this baby got alittle over 18MPG compared to the 13 mpg the 2006 Chevy. This truck is much more quieter and much more fun to drive. Smooth acceleration quick to stop. This is by far the best truck Chevy has ever put out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far, so good. No issues what-so-ever. The mileage is not great, but it is a truck so I'm not upset at all. The 5.3 is plenty for my applications, but I do think a 6 speed tranny would be better. The Crew Cab layout is great. I narrowed my selection to the Silverado and the Tundra. After driving both, I chose the Silverado. No regrets at all. Overall it's a very nice truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The OnStar is pretty neat. The XM radio is OK, but I probably won't continue with it. The steering / handling are great. The ride quality is also very good. I tend to keep vehicles awhile. My previous was a 1996 Extended cab Silverado. This is certainly a vast improvement. Good job GM.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 6th truck, and it is by far the best. Plenty of power for a 6 cyl and the mileage is fair too. I avg. 18+ in town, and get a bit over 20 on the hwy (3.23 gears). I wish the highway was better, but just put a Leer canopy (Legend-100) on and hope the highway mpg improves. The canopy increased the wind noise, which is unusual. The truck had been the quietest I have driven. The steering is absolutely the best, and the tranny shifts smoothly when warmed up. The suspension is like no other, and does not skip around "bumpy" turns, but hugs the road. OnStar and XM radio are great, although the rear speakers are weak at best. My box seems to fit fine, although slanted up. </TEXT>

<TEXT>More power & gearsI live in MN. I have the Z71 off road. Been a great truck during the winter and summer. This is my first new truck. I love it. I am getting about 18 to 20 MPG on highway. New style black truck with 18" rims looks very sharp. The fuel mgmt does help but doesnt seem to stay in 4cyl for very long even on strait level areas. Truck drives and handles very nice. Kind of tough to park in tight areas but thats to be expected with a truck. Quiet smooth ride. I have used the remote start and it is great. My only complaint about that is that it shuts off after 10 minutes. Should be at least 15 minutes for a MN winter to defrost windows and heat truck up. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Told the dealership I did not want OnStar. OnStar activated anyway. Tried to call and cancel. Only the dealership can do so in the first year. My truck and I can't cancel the service. Worst customer service i have experienced in a while from GM. Dealership has been fine. Okay truck beyond OnStar, but this service which hijacked my radio the other day drives several low ratings ratings. Think the gas mileage was better with the 5.3 in my 2007 Classic than the 5.3 in the 08. Will not buy another GM until OnStar in not mandatory. Sad that they can't figure out to center the OnStar antenna on the roof. 4th new GM truck in the last seeral years and the last until OnStar is optional</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had an F-350 when the fuel went over 4.68 a gal I had to get rid of it. I've always known Chevy was a good ride. This truck is great so far, I do find I drop power once in a while going around corners like a fuel hiccup. It's only second or two but it feels strange. The fuel mileage was great while I was watching it but it drove my girlfriend nuts so I stopped (took it off instant miles per gallon) since then my avg fuel mileage went from 16.5 to 15.8 so watching what you're doing while driving helps slow stops and gradual speed take offs does a lot. I also am a bit frustrated with the seats I can't keep the lint off. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I went truck shopping and drove the competitive model Ford, Toyota, Dodge and Chevy extended cab trucks. I was replacing an F150 that had been a very very good truck for the 7 years I owned it. Not one issue ever. So naturally I was inclined towards the Ford. After driving all the trucks I decided on the Chevy. I likes the power from the 6.0L compared to the Ford which seemed pretty weak in the pwer department. The Toyota used very poor interior materials and rode terrible. The Dodge was nice but the bed was 6.25 feet compared to the others 6.5ft bed. Overall the Chevy offered a great combination of features with the LTZ package and the Vortec Max package.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 6.0L V8 is powerful and on my commute to and from work it averages 19mpg. I also like the remote start and the design of the interior. The Vortec Max package gives you 4 wheel disc brakes which I think is important.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Where I live you need a truck you can count on, Wyoming. Unlike most states you can drive for hours and not see a town or even a person. You don't want to be stranded. Cell phone coverage is spotty at best and you need reliability. OnStar. This truck has taken a beating and has never looked back. It's comfortable even though you are going over some of the roughest roads. Fully loaded or not great truck for the snow flying months. This truck was built for the heavest of jobs and the most roughest conditions. I never was a Chevy man but know I will only buy Chevy's. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first truck I have purchased new. Totally enjoy the truck so far (3500 miles). I did have a leak in the front trasfer case, took it in and they found nothing. It hasn't leaked since. Looked like a seal was leaking. The only complaint I have is something I have seen on here, the cloth seats need constant removal of lint and seat shedding. Didn't know if this was due to "new" seats or if this will be a constant battle. Maybe should have spent the extra money for leather. Other than that it is an awesome truck, get lots of looks and compliments. Added a soft bed cover, spray in liner and chrome door handles. Back in black and lovin ever minute of it.

<TEXT>I initially got into an accident and totalled a fully loaded Tahoe. I put 96,000 problem-free miles on the Tahoe prior to it becoming a total loss. I never considered happiness could be had in a pick-up truck until the rental company put me in a crew cab Silverado for 30 days. I had to have one. The vehicle drives very smooth and due to the fuel management change from 8 to 4 cylinders on the highway, the improvement in gas mileage is very welcome. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Nice ride, very comfortable, quiet truck. My only issues are small ones. The 20" factory tires rub on the GM mudflaps when you turn sharp, the dealer tells me there is nothing more they can do. Some of the double faced tape that holds the body side moldings to the doors was too long and I had to trim off. I have to agree with some of the other reviews that the active fuel management system seems to be a joke. I just returned from a 3600 mile trip and averaged 18 mpg. My 2006 Silverado with 3:42 gears averaged 19 on the same route. Overall I do not believe there is an truck that compares to the 2008 Silverado.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the handling and performance. It is a sharp truck; sits up high unlike any of the past GM trucks that I have owned. The V6 has plenty of power and the interior is stylish and comfortable. The only thing that I can find troubling is the way the box does not line up to the cab the same on each side. It seems the box is build slightly crooked. I have checked several other new trucks and they are all the same. I would love to hear if anyone else has noticed this imperfection. Other than this I think Chevy has hit a home-run.</TEXT>

<TEXT>All in all, a much improved truck from my '04 Z71 ext. cab Silverado. The ride is great, handling is much better. My first road trip averaged 18 MPG. Hopefully it will get better as it breaks in. Chevy did away with the "plug & play" trailer brake controller harness. You'll find the wire bundle under the dash, plus 2 taped wires under the hood that have to be connected, plus an added fuse to buy. My biggest complaint: The doors lock automatically, either when shifting or at a factory set speed. There is no way to disable the auto locks. #2 is the required use of the keyless remote. Unlocking the driver's door with the key sets off the alarm. No way to change this either, I'm told.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My previous 4.3L managed almost 24 mpg on the highway, however my 2008 gets 14 to 15 mpg. I can't roll the window down with a container in the drink holder, this appears typical as I am finding more and more ergonomic issues e.g. try getting the jack out of a standard cab. I installed mud flaps over the weekend an noticed how easily the rear fenders flexed. I crawled under the truck and took a closer look at build quality; and it appears that I am the victim of excessive cost cutting.

Chevy went back to the drawing board with this one. It is a serioulsy great truck. Looks great, handles great. If you plan on carying any kind of load, I would strongly recommend the 5.3 liter. (I never tried the baby 6 cylinder) With a lumber rack, Camper shell, and full of tools, I can still get upto and maintain highway speeds like it was empty. (and about the same mileage)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive this because its a company truck. Let me first say I am biased because I hate automatic transmissions- they stink for mountain driving, and I live and work in the mountains. The auto gearing is terrible for steep descents on this truck and other automatics. The truck has got 6000 miles on it and the gas gauge just broke and the check engine light came on. It is constantly beeping with alerts and warnings. It does not go smoothly in and out of 4wd and 4 lo is super hard to get into. I am comparing this to my 1989 (almost 20 years older) Toyota which shifts in and out of 4wd and 4lo way smoother- (and the gas gauge still works.) Otherwise this is a very comfy and smooth truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfy independent seats, plenty of power, fold up bench rear seat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>No fuel economy improvement over 04 model even though I now have active fuel management. I have the 5.3L engine with 3.73 gears, flex fuel, and get about 16.5mpg hiway on gas. Wish I could have gotten 3.42 gearing for better mpg, but the catch is to get incentives you must take delivery from dealer inventory and they just don't set them up that way. Both trucks turn 1750 rpm at 60mph. I can set the info center to instant mpg readout to learn when the vehicle is in 8cyl vs 4 cyl mode. At highway speeds, wind resistance forces truck into V8 unless going downhill. And, parked together, the 08 cab is noticeably bigger than the 04 cab = more wind resistance. At 75mph, econ drops to 13.5</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cab is more comfortable than 04. Like info center. Center console roomy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Chevy truck and I can't believe the upgrades. My last was an 04 Crew Z71 4x4. A nice truck, but it is no comparison to this truck. Fit and finish is superb, ergonomics are awesome. Ride is phenomenal. Enough adjectives. Early on, it's a really nice upgrade to the previous generation "workmanlike" truck. I'll have to wait and see on reliability, my 04 had it share of issues in the early going, but I'm loyal to Chevy. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Layout of dash, seat comfort, radio controls.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have driven this truck everywhere. I race motocross for a living so it has gone all across the country and never let me down. I also tow a 22ft enclosed trailer with me for races and the truck never lets me down. Always has enough power to tow up hills. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM radio and OnStar. Two best things ever.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded my 05 of similar features. The new 08 is years ahead in quality. The ride, noise and comfort are extremely good. Very quiet at even 70+mph. Back seat comfort is better than most cars.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I too am expericing the terrible mileage. 12 in city, 17 on HWY, V-6. Chevy must have been testing this truck downhill when posting the MPG. Great to drive and up high. Quiet, great audio sound, OnStar is a first for me and love it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Best feature in just the great ride and low road noise. Lots of room, side doors swing fully open (about time). </FAVORITE>
