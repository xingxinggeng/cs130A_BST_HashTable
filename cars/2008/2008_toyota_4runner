<TEXT>A reliable SUV, it's our third 4 Runner, but our first 4 wd, and we will never get another one. We had alignment issues since the SUV was new, and still have problems with it wanting to drive off the right hand side of the road. It leaks air in all four tires approx 2-3 psi a week. As far as the Tom Tom Nav unit, we are on our 3rd chip replacement, and it still isn't very accurate.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned over 30 cars in the last 11 years-- many lux/sporters as well as 6 SUVs--suburban, 2 mits monteros, suzuki, 2 pilots and a Honda ridgeline too. I had always thought the 4runners were over priced--until I found a used 2008 Toyota certified one owner 45k mile sr5 in Denver for ~$22k. Very impressed with the ergonomic/practical design AND I actually get 22+ mpg in city and 27+mpg on highway!!---puts my Honda pilot and any other full sized SUVs to shame. None better! Now I know why they are so popular. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>fit/finish; practical design; excellent mpg-- 22/27mpg actual mileage!; Toyota certified used car program (7yr/100,000 mile warranty)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I picked the 4Runner after a years research. The ride with the Xreas suspension is very good. I receive many compliments on the color (Salsa Red) and the looks of the vehicle. This is my second Toyota. I got my wife a 2004 Camry V6 Limited and she loves it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Went looking for an SUV at a Chevy dealer and bought a Toyota 4runner, we were so impressed with the vehicle and I (male) love looking at it in the driveway as well as driving it. I read the reviews and say they are spot on! Paint chips easily and the front end/hood needs to be more aggressive. We have the hood scoop with a V8 and Magnaflow exhaust...sounds great, drives great. This vehicle is fun to drive, handles great, and is solid! We looked at/drove Hummer H3, Jeep Laredo, Pathfinder, but walked away with the 4runner on the spot! We never owned a Toyota before, but we are extremely glad we bought this one. Never buying an American model again, over priced!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V8, AWD...fast! Like the interior also, but living in Vegas we have recently had problems with the CD Changer/radio display because of the heat. Not sure what's going on, but CD's are getting kicked out on start up. H3 didn't offer the rear air vents, amongst other standard features on Toyota!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove many SUVs until I got into this 4runner. Right away I could sense that this vehicle was a step up to another level. It's definitely in another league from the all wheel drives and cross overs. It drove like a luxury car and I and my wife were hooked. We love this truck. Can't wait to go out into the desert 4 wheeling and exploring. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I originally wanted a Tundra Limited Pickup because of the versatility, the sunroof, and the electric back window, but it wouldn't fit in the garage, so I waited until there was a 0% financing option and bought the 4- Runner. I love it with a few reservations. As I've read in other reviews, the mpg indicator is somewhat optimistic. I've been averaging about 20 mpg at highway speeds of 70 mph. If I keep it at 55-60 I've done as well as 23 with the V6. The interior with the Urban Runner option is much nicer than the standard Sport, but I wonder how sturdy the Alcantara portion of the seats will be over time. The Tom-Tom GPS is great, as you can remove and use separately.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>With the sunroof open, side and rear windows down it reminds me of my 1965 Mercury Montclair with the Breezeway window ... feels like almost like a convertible. Great looking in Titanium Silver Metallic. The seats are very comfortable and non-fatiguing on a 8.5 hour trip taken recently.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my 4runnner because I had a severe shoulder injury where I could not drive my manual 2006 Tacoma. Of course nothing could replace my truck, the 4Runner came in next. I bought it because there is the potential for my family to grow. Living in Alaska, there is A LOT to do, and even more to see and I need a vehicle that would take me where I needed to go and all the gear I need to take with me. I tow a fleetwood evolution trailer with my V6 and it is noticed, but not a hindrance. I love driving my sport edition and love the XREAS suspension. The fuel economy display is inaccurate at best, but I have no real complaints. It does what I want it to do, and in style and comfort. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sport edition with the 8 speakers is among the best stock stereos I have heard. I really like that the back window goes down, so do my dogs. Fold flat seats allow me to sleep when I go camping and fishing. We'll see how it does on my trip to the arctic circle next month.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Major Exhaust prob..</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have already taken my '08 Toy. 4Runner 5 times to 3 different Toyota dealerships for service... they've changed my catalytic converter and I still have a problem with my exhaust and emission system of this car. When I drive it in the highway in the speeds of 60 MPH and faster I get a real STRONG and HEAVY sulfuric and ammonia scent entering inside of the vehicle which gives me a headache and bothers my newborn baby. I basically cannot drive this automobile with my windows down!!! Toyota service is the worst that I've ever seen!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the 4Runner for my wife's daily driver to haul all the baby gear as well as vacation traveler that can drive out on the beach, etc. It is the best-quality vehicle we've ever owned by far. It has enough power (V6) and the XREAS makes the handling very good for a truck-based SUV. Interior and controls are top-notch, and it's a great looking SUV, especially in black. Only complaint is cargo space is low compared to a highlander, but that's the trade off for an SUV with a body-on-frame construction. We have a large Yakima box for the roof which fits all the overflow cargo when going on vacation. Overall, highly suggested and I hope Toyota never gets rid of the great 4Runner.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roll-down rear gate window, seat adjustability is great, BRAKES are awesome (better than some sports cars I've owned), engine super-smooth, 4WD features are nice and easy to use, vehicle is quiet on the highway. Rear blind-spot backing mirrors are a nice touch too!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drove a 2006 4Runner until it was totaled on January 29, 2009. That vehicle gave me back my life. It suffered a severe side impact at 55 MPH, rolled twice, slid on its roof and ended up with the driver's side on the ground. I walked away with no serious injuries. Even though there was severe damage to the sides and roof of the vehicle and suspension parts and some of the drivetrain were all over the highway, the roof pillars never collapsed and the interior was intact. Before making the 06 purchase, I did check to see which SUV's best protect their occupants. The 4Runner was the leader hands down. Now I am driving an 08. This time I made sure that I had the side curtain air bags.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very comfortable and fun to drive on our three hour drive to the mountains. Capable of off-road navigation from the dealer. My dogs love the rear cargo area.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have a 2008 Sport Edition with the V8. I love driving the car. For a truck based chassis, it is a nice ride. If I wanted a car base SUV, I would have purchased a car or a Highlander. The gas mileage could be better, but after all it is a truck with a big V8. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been driving for more than 20 years now and this is my first vehicle with automatic transmission. I always had sports sedans before. I love this SUV. I tested the V6 but found it too buzzy and underpowered (my last car was a Subaru Legacy GT though which was very fast). The V8 is buttery smooth. The ride on the highway is almost as smooth as my wife's Lexus GX470. Great size (not too big, not too small). Trip computer is a bit optimistic. I average about only 17mpg doing mostly highway driving at 70-75 mph. Hopefully fuel stays cheap!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove two Pathfinders for a total of almost 20 years and wish I had stuck with them. While I agree with what most of the reviewers say about the SR5, I find it difficult to understand when they say it has a smooth ride. To the contrary, I find it stiff, bouncy, and very fatiguing, and nothing like the Pathfinders which were very smooth and non-fatiguing. One other gripe. The displays for the radio/CDP and the stuff below are extremely dim. I can barely read them in daylight hours and there's no way to brighten them up. Audio quality is also mediocre. I will keep it for three years or less and then trade it in when I can afford to. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>None I can think of. Perhaps it's build quality, but it's brand new so have no way of knowing what the long term outcome will be.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well - this is my 1st SUV. Was purchased pretty much for cross-country traveling. Rides much better than expected given that it is body-on-frame with a solid rear axle. Of course that is what gives the 4Runner true off-road capability which includes true 4-wheel LO with the ability to lock up the axles. Excellent tracking in rain and snow with at least a reasonable chance of getting out if you foul up and get stuck. Leather seats are comfortable and multi-adjustable. Good visibility and the LTD comes with a back-up camera that plays thru the nav system for a decent view behind you. Rear hatch closes electrically once you get close to avoid slamming. Not a rattle or a squeak </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>NO rattles or squeaks. Electric rear window. Heated seats. Very smooth ride on the highway. Compass in rear-view mirror. Nav has a good sized screen with adjustments for brightness and color. A bit daunting to learn for an "old guy", but I'm getting there. JBL stereo. Steering wheel controls.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well got my 4Runner back in April 2008 and already have 12,000 miles, this cars runs great so far. It's a V6 Sport Package and it looks mean with that hood scoop! The car does its work how SUV should. The power is great the comfort is great just took it hunting and off road so it's a good piece of machine. I would recommend this SUV over any American made SUV!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned a few vehicles in my time and nothing comes close to matching the overall quality and purchase experience I have gotten with the Runner. I went with the limited V8. Oh so smooth and quiet and not a single rattle... Handles unbelievably with the XREAS. Gas mileage more than reasonable for the smoothness, quietness and capability provided. Have had it for almost a year now and my feeling is that I will be able to keep this thing for my planned minimum 10 years easy. I can not say enough about this truck... very attached to it :-) I considered a new Pathfinder. Not the same vehicle for sure. Could have gotten a much better deal on the Nissan but just couldn't do it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our third Toyota (Tundra and Matrix) and have been just as impressed with the performance and quality save for a couple of small annoyances like the TPMS and the temp controls with a mind of their own. Very well behaved and comfy on and off road, tried to spin the tires on the dirt but couldn't due to traction control, just launched (scary). Head room is limited but will learn to live with it (I'm only 5'10"). We will keep this rig for a very long time. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sun roof and rear window, V8, Galactic Gray paint, cup holders that a Nalgene bottle will fit in (still need one more for the wifes and my coffee). Plenty of leg room in the back seats for adults. Did I mention the sun roof and the V8?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I replaced my 2002 Ford Explorer with a 2008 4Runner SR5. I got about the same vehicle, options wise, with the exceptions that the explorer had leather and a 6 disc CD system and was about $10,000 less new. Although I love the way the 4Runner looks, it doesn't have as much head room, the double decker cargo system is a pain, and you cannot touch the vehicle without scratching it. (Try keeping your kids from touching it.) It's also harder to reach the backseat from the front. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I chose the 4Runner Sport V6 RWD based on reliability and looks despite the RAV4 Sport V6 getting better gas mileage and sports-car like performance. This is my first SUV (on my 9th car in 17 years of driving) and I am getting used to sitting high up and the car with more of a truck-like feel (Tacoma versus the RAV4). Keep in mind my view is based on previously driving an Audi A3 and BMW 3. The Galactic Gray Mica is beautiful and I get compliments (brighter with blue sparkle than most dull grays). The V6 has plenty of power for urban driving and I get a respectable 22mpg hwy (19.5 mpg mixed). The X-REAS suspension works very well, providing for a comfortable ride on twisty roads. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of trunk space, sunroof, Galactic Gray paint. X-REAS suspension. I also like the cupholders, which really can hold large bottles.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my '08 SR5 2WD 4Runner now for over a month and have put a couple of thousand miles on it. Wow, this is it, the best true SUV. When I was ready to replace my '97 LT 2WD Chevy Tahoe I looked and test drove a bunch of vehicles. After driving the 4Runner for an extended tested drive I knew it was the truck for me. The V6 performs so well in so many areas, the truck is laid out perfectly and thoughtfully, and at 6'-5" and 280 I'm very comfortable. It is awesome on the highway, very quiet, very solid and plenty of power. Lots of compartments to stowaway stuff. I am set for canoing, fly fishing, biking and camping.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After almost 6,000 miles, we are still impressed with our 4Runner. We recently towed our Lund 1750 Fisherman (2500 lbs with motor and trailer) 525 miles and averaged 17.5 mpg. Most of that was in 4th gear, using overdrive only when going on level or down hill roads. AND, that was into a headwind going to the cabin and a strong cross wind coming back. Pretty amazing. What impressed us the most was the stability of the truck and trailer rig. Not once did a semi-truck passing in the other direction on 2-lane roads shake the 4Runner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Navigation big disappointment, Eclipse AVN 2210p with lousy radio, CD and nav. The iPod connector is behind the unit, special cable and rip apart the dash to set it up. The iPod connector should be readily accessible in front of the unit like the USB port for other media storage devices. The interior should be leather, either gray or black but not with with suede. For trouble shooting neither Toyota, Eclipse, nor TomTom are of help as they will blame each other or refer you to the other for help. The rest of the vehicle I have no complains, have a 2008 Urban Runner V6 4WD blizzard white pearl that borders on spectacular. Have noted the drive shaft "clunk" also a problem in Lexus GX47.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased Urban Runner Sport edition because of the overall appearance and option package. After 1000 miles, I have enjoyed the driving experience. The Blizzard Pearl color really stands out. The xreas stability control is not just a gimmick, but gives a safer feel to handling. MPG has been running from 20.5 to 22.7. I drive 65-70 mph with 80% hwy driving. Bluetooth function paired nicely with my iPhone and works well. Tomtom was a big letdown. Don't buy the UR package for the Tomtom. Instead opt for the nav option in a Sport or Limited. It cost more, but if GPS guidance is what you're looking for spend more for the nav/backup option. V6 engine has good acceleration for a 4.0.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, MPG, ride. Will change my own oil thanks to nifty idea on oil filter/drain idea. Like the overall looks of the UR package and the pearl really stands out over standard white 4runner. Use my phone a lot and Bluetooth option is great.</FAVORITE>

We don't know why we didn't buy this car back in 2003. The build quality is superior and has very useful features that any American car would envy. I have always heard of Toyotas lasting for 250,000+ miles, so lets hope this one will do the same!

<TEXT>Ever since I sold my '94 4Runner in 2006, I've always had my eye on getting another. My only complaint about the '94 was that there was no V8 at the time, and the V6 was WAY underpowered. So when I was in the market for a new car, I purchased the V8 Limited 4WD, and I'm happy. The new 4Runner is futuristic enough, while still maintaining the DNA of the original generations. The solid construction, "never-die" dependability, and fun driving attitude make it a joy to drive. It's as if I'm back in the '94, but this time, with all the power I've ever wanted with 270 HP, and 300+ ft/lbs of torque. I'm raring to get this thing off road where it belongs.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, we traded in our 2006 V8 Limited X-REAS for a 2008 that is exactly the same in every respect. The new Michelins ride nicier but have less grip and are softer (bouncier) than the Bridgestones, we do not like the new tires. The X-REAS suspension is softer on the 2008 and does not handle as well, if the shocks were a little stiffer it would be perfect. We drive fast generally and live in the country, the handling is important to us.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V-8 feels stronger on the low-end and midrange than the 2006, love that. Mileage is still great 20mpg with all synthetic oil. Rear window, JBL stereo, nav, wheels, perfect size car for us, Torsen diff is awesome, live axle and great towing for a med size SUV. A perfect compromise even my wife loves!</FAVORITE>

Until just last week I was hit broadside by a woman who fell asleep behind the wheel driving @ 60+ miles/hour. My 4runner took the hit like a champ. Every safety feature worked flawlessy, saving my life. I feel there would have been a much more tragic result if I had been driving any other vehicle. The other driver survived as well, but then again she was driving a tank. I plan on buying a brand new 4Runner this weekend and will be a loyal 4Runner owner for life! This is a great buy for many, many reasons. I highly recommend this SUV to anyone with style and safety in mind.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety features are by far the best on the market. Every safety feature works flawlessly. Believe me, I am a living testament. I really would not be here if it hadn't been for my 4Runner. The XSP package is awesome. It really made my truck stand out from the crowd. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had my runner for a couple weeks. Came out of a ford supercrew which i loved, but needed something with better gas mileage. I get off road some and pull a utility trailer with my atv or mower on it. I did not want one of the car based SUVs and the 4runner seemed like the perfect fit for how I use a vehicle. I miss the room from my truck but am tickled with the gas mileage improvement and the the sr5 drives and handles great on and off road. The ride is quiet and smooth while still being a true truck based vehicle. I am quite happy. The vehicle I got happened to have a moon roof. A feature I would never have ordered, but really enjoy it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage (22-25 hwy), looks, 4wd performance, ride, quietness.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Searched and searched for a replacement for my wife's Toyota Tundra. Wanted something smaller - but still had some capacity to haul stuff. Looked at Mercedes ML350, VW Tourag, Chevy Tahoe. We kept trying to convince ourselves not to buy another Toyota, now we have 3 in the drive way. This SUV rocks! Solid build, great ride and all the comfort you can ask for. Like the Limited look, lighted running boards, nav system and heated seats. Don't know about gas mileage yet as we have yet to fill the tank. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav & roll down rear window. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great build quality, excellent ride (even with the XREAS suspension, which firms up the ride just slightly, but it handles great in the corners), good brakes, comfortable seats (I am 6 ft 1 and fit easily) - couldn't be happier. Silky smooth V8, and gas mileage after 1 week was a pleasant surprise - 20.3 combined city and highway (I drive it gently, though!). Can't wait to take it to the mountains in Arizona and find some snow!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, quality interior materials (i.e., no cheap plastics anywhere), solid feeling, great view, fun to drive, its general utility, plenty of space, great ride for a truck based SUV, love the nav system, especially the back up camera (a GREAT safety feature). Rugged good looks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Nice truck. Toyota reliability throughout, but they aren't giving anything away! If you want the nice features like lit-up window/lock/mirror controls on the door or a simple garage door opener, you better pony up a few more bucks. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety features like stability control, ABS, side bags and curtains. Nice ride and again, Toyota reliability, and higher than average resale.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It?s all in the details. This 100% Japanese-made wonder is exactly what those who appreciate automotive excellence in engineering are looking for. From the convex mirrors on the ?D? pillars so you can see what or who might be approaching as you think about backing out into the parking lane, to the 3 jets in each of the two windshield washer spigots on the hood, to the extra compartment in the glove box, to the oil filter on the 4.0 liter V-6 located on the top of the engine, to the quality of the leather on the seats, to the built-in trash bag holder on the rear of the console, to the wonderfuly quiet ride and smooth suspension. It is all so very impressive. We couldn't be more pleased.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>X-REAS suspension (opt on Limited) which flattens out corners; QV Limited Value package; flattest folding rear seat (models w/o 3rd row); lights on running boards; distinctive black wood- grain; Nav with backup camera; tilt & telescoping wheel; lots of torque; LED taillights; factory trailer hitch.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had a '96 4Runner and decided to get another, the 2008 Limited 4WD. The only Japanese SUV with a solid axle - I tow a 3000 lb boat. The 6 has lots of pep for towing on the weekends. I don't feel like I've given up any towing by not getting the 8 (but I bet the 8 can really tow) and benefit from good mileage during the week. The car is solid, nav and Bluetooth are excellent. Backup camera allows me to line up the tow hitch, a valuable option for me. I did remove all the 4Runner badging - one of the only Toyotas to have the badging on the sides of the car. AC controls are Gameboyish, but I keep the Auto climate control on all the time (even when towing), so don't use them.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine (6) and solid axle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I?m very happy with my 4Runner and with a little tweaking plus a few accessories I will like it even more. Hopefully the TRD supercharger will be available soon. So far (three tanks) my mileage has been slightly better than advertised which is always a pleasant surprise. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bumper to bumper full length ladder frame with the body?s robust front, side and rear crumple zones plus the roof corners are heavy gauge steel and feel solid. Four piston front brake calipers, active headrests,fast navigation system with plenty of extras. Excellent paint finish and body panel fit.</FAVORITE>
