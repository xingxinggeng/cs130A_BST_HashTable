<TEXT>I bought my 1st Vibe in 2003. I loved it. I am a park ranger but grew up in the city, this car was the best of both! It has nice style for the city yet it was perfect when I moved to Yellowstone. The back has ample space to fit all sorts of gear and the roof rack adds extra space. Front pass. seat flips down so when I bought 10 foot 2X4's they fit perfectly. Even if they had been longer I would not worry cause back window pops open! While traveling X country I recharged by AA batt. using the 2 prong outlet in dashboard. After hiking I throw my dirty boots in the trunk & never worry about a mess cause it is durable plastic. Never had a prob. In June I got 2008, gave 2003 to mom- she loves it</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Two prong outlet, flip down seats, durable plastic trunk and the Engine is a Toyota!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>i love this car. its is a reliable, fun, peppy sporty little car, but at the same time works for my baby. getting him in and out is easy as the car sits fairly high as opposed to most other cars you have to bend over into.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>sunroof, 5 speed manual transmission, sound system available for purchase(i reccomend buying this, extra subwoofer makes such a difference and you dont have some big aftermarket clunky thing taking up precious cargo space)car sits high off the ground, very comfortable and easy to get in & out of.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased this car on ebay from a dealer in texas. paid 13,000 car had 13,000 miles on it. i love the roomy interior. i use this more as a truck sometimes than a car. always seems i have something to haul and the fold down back seat is a lifesaver. we used this on a trip from NW indiana down to mississippi and had no problems. we use this car now more than our other one. havent had any problems and have owned for about six months but have made several long distance trips in it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>gas mileage! we average 31-32 easy mostly country roads and highway driving. hatchback with the window that you can open. very conveinent not to have to open the whole hatchback to put in one bag.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I guess I picked the fully loaded version GT, which has everything everyone wants. In comparison to my Ford Explorer, it is small but roomy. Handles pretty well in wet and slick conditions as long as I don't try to put her on test by making sharp turns. Traction control is awsome, kept me straight on the road in past snowy days. It is not designed by Toyota but GM and Toyota has several projects done together under the name of Nummi. Just like Ford had been building Mercurry Villager and Nissan Quests on the same assembly line but general public does not know the inside facts.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of room for luggage and after folding rear seats. Fits in average parking spot, parking is easy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great car getting 34 mph highway with a manual. Capable of 150- 200 K easy. Too bad it takes Toyota to design such a great car for GM. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of room, solid, dependable. Much road noise from plastic inner fenders but great fit-finish. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Only problem I've had was the auto trans not shifting into the next gear at the end of a 550 mile trip, but that could have been the terrain. The seats are nice and hug you so that if you drive sporty you wont slide off on sharp turns. Tons of space if you need it. I got a loaded sun and sound, auto, preferred, monotone 08 Vibe for 18K out the door because they redesigned them for 2009 and pushing the 2008's out. Get a 2008 if you can! The MPG is great, really worth it because you get a nice zip without ruining your wallet.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hatchback makes life easier from parallel parking to transporting things. I really feel like I have the interior space of an SUV, just lower to the ground. I like the premium sound system and I think it's definitely worth it if you like to experience music.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Paid $17,400 out the door..auto & power locks, keyless, etc. no sunroof. I needed a car that could haul a lot if needed AND pull a small boat. This car has so far been great! Had a U-Haul hitch put on and it pulled my boat with ease. I threw a beach cruiser bike in the back with no trouble, plenty of room, didn't even put the front seat down! Had an antenna ipod adapter installed so I can play my iPOD...yay! ONLY thing I am not thrilled about is that I did not get white! This color (a blue-green) shows every speck of dust! And the Black-Charcoal interior is just dumb...draws heat and shows every hair, dirt , etc. I got cream seat covers and has made a difference.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>"Zippiness", roominess, outlet for my laptop, and MPG. Getting 30-31 hwy & city with A/C on and Automatic. My Savannah Dealer gives a loaner car anytime you use their service dept. I like that!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The visibility, fuel economy and cargo space for us is outstanding. GM is missing the boat by not promoting it more on TV. The joint venture between Toyota and GM is evident regarding the motor and drivetrain quality. Our experience in wind, rain and snow has been good. Vehicle has good heater and air conditioning. Can't afford a convertible so the sunroof gives us our fresh air fix. We have driven it on 500 mile trips and at 2600 rpm it is just whispering down the road. Sitting comfort for 2-3 hours at a time was excellent. The car is only half of our joy. The other half is the dealer who takes care of it for us. Most of our driving is in the city but I would recommend it to anyone. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>visibility is great because of elevated seating. Fuel efficiency compliments our driving needs. We get 26-28 mpg in city and 35-37 on highway. We do follow all speed limits but do drive 67 on highway. AC does not pull car down. Cargo space is great for walker and other needs to transport. Love it. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I commute several miles each way and this is the perfect car for me! It's very roomy and comfortable! Not to mention not that bad with gasoline. The interior is what amazes me each time I get into it! I had been driving a smaller model car and this is like driving in a dream after hitting all of the bumps in the car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the Vibe for a month and I'm liking it so far. As mentioned in other reviews, it seriously needs a telescoping steering wheel. The despicably low center arm rest can be replaced with a Corolla arm rest for much better comfort. The roof rack- less roof rack makes no sense. The cross bars used to be standard. Have to unscrew the antenna to use it anyway. The upgrade stereo is nice, so are the alloys. I like the head rest positioning, never had a car that I could actually rest my head on the head rest while driving. Plenty of rear seat room, and cargo carpet and bungee tie-downs are a must-have. Getting 32-34 mpg using 10% ethanol.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Storage compartments, ease of entry - exit. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As you can see from our ratings, we are enjoying the comfort and gas mileage of our Vibe. However, we are experiencing one problem other Vibe owners do not seem to be having: a poor fitting hatchback. We live on a dirt road and dust accumulates inside the hatchback top, bottom and side ridges. Moisture, leaves, and twigs also are in evidence when it rains. Daylight is seen through the top of the hatchback when it is closed. This is either a poor design or a fabrication error. We intend to pursue this problem directly with General Motors as the dealership was unresponsive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 5-speed manual is fun to drive and we are getting 39 mph on the highway and almost 30 in town. The storage area is great with the seats down. Overall, it is a great-looking car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Nice reliable transportation that offers acceptable gas mileage at the cost of acceleration, performance & in cabin comforts. I am experiencing a few rattles in the cabin during acceleration that gets louder the harder you push the small 1.8 L. Sunroof is disappointing, 2 visits to the dealer has made the leaking almost stop. Versatility of fold down seats and cargo capacity are spectacular.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We looked at cars for over a month and decided on the Vibe. It has plenty of room for me(6'-2") and my wife(5'- 10"). It has good looks, great fuel mileage, and comfort all in one affordable package. Great for weekend trips as it has plenty of room for all our things. Overall a great car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sporty looks, dash view you get as the driver, plenty of storage area in the back, 32+ MPG.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We were looking for a family car and came across the Matrix and then realized the Vibe was less $ and had a lot of rebates. We like the Vibe styling better the the Matrix. We have the base model with no options, it's perfect for us. It is a undertaking to make sure all 5 doors are locked. Good power/gearing. A/C seems on the light side. Can't turn off head lights at night! Check the vibe forums to find out how to turn off seat belt beep for passenger seat (if you put a backpack on the passenger seat it will loudly beep at you. Blind spots are bad, buy blind spot mirrors. Nice stock tires. Lots of cool little storage areas. Love how the seats fold down. Liked 08 better than 09. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fold down seats. Very active forms online that help with issues. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought for gas mileage, style, and storage capacity. Mileage varies between 26 - 36, depending on type of driving. Used for vacation and was pleased with capacity, mileage, responsiveness and comfort. Was surprised that there was not much noticeable road noise in most circumstances. A little stiffer suspension than expected on rough roads.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cargo space and functionality are excellent. Fun to drive. Responsive, good acceleration, good gas mileage. Love the look of the two tone appearance package.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was on a business trip in San Diego and rented a Vibe in 2006. Before I arrived at my Motel, I was very impressed with this car. I am 6 foot 6 inches tall and fit very well in it. What really sold me was how little fuel it took. I now own a 2008 and average 33-35 mpg in town and 36 to 39 mpg on the highway. By the way it is a 5-speed, which is a hoot to drive, especially around town. Thanks for a great little car Pontiac! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>How well a tall person fits. Very user friendly dash. Great fuel mileage. Very easy to park and get around in the city. Union made in the USA.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is proof that you can get great fuel economy without buying a hybrid. drives like a sports car, handles well carries our big Bernese mtn. dogs lots of cargo space even for 8 ft. lumber. the vibe is in my opinion much better, and sportier looking than than the Toyota Matrix version. I get consistently 34 to 36 mpg. which gives me around a 400 mile range I average 37 mpg with non-ethanol gas. It handles well in the snow with the front wheel drive and my manual transmission (which I had to search for) I traded a gas guzzling trailblazer for it and the vibe is just as much fun to drive. I love this car and would definitely considering buying another at trade in time. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the optional 5 spd. manual transmission which I would highly recommend. I tried an automatic which lacked acceleration and pep. the 5 spd changed the whole equation. the sun roof, folding seats, rear suv style door, handling, side curtain air bags and fuel economy make this a great car</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this to save on gas mileage, commuting 1 hour a day to work Hwy. I'm only getting 25 mph, sticker says 26-31 and am not happy. We planned on traveling and using luggage carrier ( we unfortunately discovered rails to hold carrier don"t come with car so you need to spend extra to buy that) but where to put carrier as radio antennae is on roof? I do like driving it tho, not sure if we will keep car tho with gas mileage poor.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was attracted to this car for its potential for versatility and gas mileage. I have owned it for a little over a month, and have been very happy with it so far. It has a fair amount of pep, but will never be mistaken for a six cylinder. To me this is a fair trade-off for the great gas mileage. My average mileage has been 26 MPG with heavy city driving. The steering is responsive on dry pavement and the car is very predictable driving in the snow. This car is a great car to run around town with your kids or take a trip</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the versitality of storage in the Vibe. I can transport just about anything I need to. The heat and air conditioning blower delivers alot of air. The 110 volt plug is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is now our second Vibe based on our great experience with our '05 Vibe. It is used as a commuter and vacationing vehicle - it has great fuel economy and comfort for long trips. We are both over 6ft tall and have had trouble finding a comfortable seating arrangement that is not a SUV. Headroom is great but *watch out for the sunroof if your any taller than 6ft*. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cargo space (actually moved a two- seater couch), Instrument panel(good illumination), good sound system with XM option, fuel economy, maneuverability is excellent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Defintitley notice the change going from a Forester (AWD) to the Vibe. It handles slick roads rather poorly, spinning the wheels as we turn corners on wet roads. But the mileage has ranged from 24 mpg city to 36 highway, doing better than our old Forester. Very cute and hip! Love the size and larger backseat. </TEXT>
