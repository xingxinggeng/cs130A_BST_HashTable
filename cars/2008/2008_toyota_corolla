<TEXT>Our 10th Toyota, 3rd Corolla. Reliability in 31000 miles: 0 problems. Economy with automatic: 27-30 mpg city, 36-42 hwy. Great seats for local or long distance. Steering position a little awkward on long drives-- telescoping wheel would be a plus. Popping noise some have mentioned in other reviews may be ABS self-test when you are starting forward from stop (owner's manual mentions this). Gripes? Upholstery poorly sewn (wrinkles from the git-go) on US-assembled model (never had this problem on Japan- assembled Toyotas). Roof- and rocker- panel trim strips came loose in normal driving. Power adequate, auto-shifting is smoother than my Subie, quiet on road, comfort, cost of ownership.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Reliability, MILEAGE, comfort, top value for the money. AFFORDABLE service (less than $50 for 30k service, vs. almost $600 for my Impreza!!!) Steel timing chain. Regular gas. Best options: ABS, curtain/side airbags.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just drove 440 miles to Rocklin, ca. from orange county ca. What fun, 34.0 to 36.4 MPG and handled great at 80 mph with new Michelin tires. I bought this 2008 used with 27600 miles and its like new. If you are thinking of a Corolla just drive one, I am 5'10" tall and fit perfect in it. You may pay a little more for this car but well worth the $$...</TEXT>

<TEXT>My last 9 cars have all been $35+ luxury cars. When my last 2002 Odyssey bit the dust (after 220,000 miles) I decided to buy a car that would pay for itself because of improved gas mileage. After test driving a Civic, I realized I needed something with more interior space and focused on the Corolla instead. I found a great deal on a used 2009 LE, and have enjoyed it ever since. Very spacious inside (important, as I am tall as are my 4 sons) and great gas mileage. I do consistently about 38 miles per gallon on average and as such the car pays for itself (compared to my Honda). I only wish there was a remote trunk release and a horn beep when you remote lock the doors. Overall, rate it A+.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage, spacious interior, easy to maneuver, brightly lit controls, love how the lights are always on (no need to turn them on at night... all automatic), great stereo, split fold down of rear seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this car for almost 2 years now. I fell in love with the color first (Speedway blue) and then liked the rest of it. LOVE the sunroof; I drive with it and my windows open every day during the summer. It handles pretty well, EXCEPT in snow! Do NOT buy this car if you live where it snows a lot. I end up taking public transportation every time it snows. I haven't had any mechanical problems with it - just the regular maintenance. The only thing is the driver's window rattles and the breaks just started squeaking, but those are very minor. It is very spacious - inside the car AND trunk. Overall, great car, just wish it was better in snow!</TEXT>

<TEXT>A great car. I call it my golf cart for the interstate. Gets great gas mileage, roomy interior and trunk. Great sound system. My 15 year old thinks it is the bomb with speedway blue metallic color and the exterior moldings. I think I may not be driving this car when she turns 16. Oh well, I'll just buy another one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Lets see, I traded in my 2005 Toyota Matrix XRS 6 speed manual for a 2008 Toyota Corolla S automatic. First thing I noticed was how smooth the ride was. Interior materials are excellent...and the exterior styling was very well done with the ground effects, and spoiler. The white faced gauges are something I really like...very sporty but also very useful day or night time. I see they did away with those in the 2009 model. Overall, very pricey for a small car but hey you get what you pay for. I think the Corolla is worth it. Test drive it...appreciate it for what it is...a small fuel efficient vehicle that has some nice sporty accents and a bullet proof engine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I now have 21000 miles & love the car. I avg 31mpg on my short trips lots of 3mile rides to work. When I am on the freeway I get 38 to 41 mpg depends on how much of a hurry I am in. Love the 5k oil change interval. The trak control or VSA is a must have. JBL sound upgrade is not that special. It's the best car for the money for sure.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car for my own first brand new car off the lot. Came as a recommendation from my parents who wouldn't help me look at anything else. A year later, I wish I would have taken my chances on my own. Uncomfortable, poor ride, driving position is horrible, can feel the engine vibrating through the floor boards with only 9000 miles on it. Way overpriced for what you get. Recently test drove other cars and realized how big a mistake the corolla was. I would not recommend this car to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got 35 mpg for this little car, I am wondering if because I am a tiny woman or the added sporty package gives me extra miles. Anyways, I am so attached to this car. I wish a little bit extra storage inside of the car like my husband's RAV. I have put 22000 miles on the car so far, never have any problem. Car still performs like new one. The state I live in has speed limit of 65 on the freeway, so I cannot say much about the power. But I do know it accelerates slower on the ramp. But it does get a little fishtailed in the strong wind gust.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was of the opinion that I would never buy another American automobile again, because of repairs, when I purchased my 2008 Toyota Corolla. The Corolla has changed my mind back to buying American. The Corolla gives a rough ride and, within 24,000 miles, has given me several problems. The problems are: poor handling in the ice and snow, loose steering, front brake assembly recall, constant rear brake adjustments, wipers that don't cycle properly, power windows that cycle properly, tires that need constant filling, squeaky frame when under load, and loose gasoline filler tube.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We love the ride and gas mileage of our 2008 Corolla S. The big negative though is exactly like another owner stated if you do not warn this vehicle for at least 10 minutes in the winter the car has a lot of PISTON SLAP. We took the car to the dealer and was also told that this noise is normal but this cannot be for a car so new.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great mileage, easy handling, dash components within easy reach, tire pressure monitors a pain on real cold days - likely with any car with TPM systems. Why they left out an MP3 connector is beyond comprehension - otherwise a perfect car. Good height, visibility, what you want in a larger vehicle but with the great fuel economy . </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Great car</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>After purchasing this car, and knowing how Toyota builds their cars, I found that this Corolla had what it for me to drive. Handles very well on dry or wet roads. In city, mileage is good but on the highway, I was able to get about 35 mpg; combined about 31 mpg. Interior is very comfortable and those in the back seat are very pleased with comfort. The 'blind' spots that everyone is concerned with is not really there; one has to still move their head to look around. Getting in and out of the car is a breeze and easy. All controls are where you would want them. Great car as far as I'm concerned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite is the stereo system. The sound is amazing. Also the controls are where I like them. Comfortable to reach and use. It's easy to fall asleep in this car, even when it is moving down the road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is absolutely amazing. It's also a road-trip machine. First road trip was from KC to Dallas and absolutely felt refreshed after arriving. Gas mileage is A+ and I love the thickness of the seats. It's also got decent pickup. Cons: Sunroof is having sort of a rattling sound. I'm also experiencing the brake pop issue another reviewer posted on. I also agree it only happens when you move from reverse to drive and vice-versa. I have yet to go to the dealer for an explanation.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first Toyota I have ever owned and I am very satisfied with the Corolla. I commute 110 miles each day (mostly highways) and I have gotten as high as 41 mpg. My average mileage ranges between 37 to 39 mpg. Who needs an expensive hybrid with this kind of mileage. The engine is willing and fairly quick from a stop light. The five speed is fun and the ratios are well spaced. The a/c works great and there is plenty or room for passengers and parcels. Although the handling is not quite as sporty as my old Mazda Protege, it is a much quieter and smoother ride. Overall, very impressed with the Corolla. Is it perfect, no. Is it a great commuter, yes-especially at the pumps.</TEXT>

<TEXT> I started getting this popping clunking noise from brakes whenever I take off from park position or after I have reversed the car and apply brakes. I only have 14520 miles on it. I bought it brand new. It is a loud noise. The dealership told me it was a normal noise. I don't think so! The other Toyota Corolla models from previous years don't make this noise. Beware before you buy 2008 Corolla. Other than this noise my Corolla runs great 28 mpg in town, 325 miles to tank of gas of 12.5 gallons. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car stability was awesome, in extremes weather of -40 degree F during winter, it will cruise to a 12-14 inches of snow (without winter tires). Question of mileage? 29-30 mpg city & 36-37mpg highway... what can you ask for? Side curtain air-bag, TMPs, day-light running time, spacious leg room, wide trunk space, 6 CD changer, good AC/defroster, power locks/window, variable windshield wiper control & the fuel consuming cruise control, excellent brake against crossing moose & deers, and good suspension. Corolla rocks beyond expectations!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I feel so smart having purchased this car. I was doing a lot of research before buying. I get on avg 28 mpg within city and around 35 mpg on highway. Exactly as advertised. Only drawback: no mp3 player however, I feel reliability, safety and gas mileage are important than a mp3 player or fancy in built gps in a car and if you are a middle class guy like me who values money, corolla makes sense.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Never had a Corolla before this but my husband's family has owned quite a few. I like the gas mileage and it drives smoother than the Honda Civic we test drove. I dislike the fact that the brakes make a loud "popping noise" when you take off and/or put it in reverse. It's loud enough that ppl in the back seat and on the street will make comments about why a 2008 car would sound like that. Have taken it to the dealership who says the brakes have "floating" parts on them & all 08s sound like that. Next visit in, I heard someone else complaining of the same thing. It didn't happen until the car got about 15,000 mi on it. Now it's more frequent than ever. Other than that it's fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car just over 6 wks and I am impressed with all but a few things. The mileage is great, but you have to adjust your driving habits to get the most from this car. I am averaging just over 35 mpg in combined city/highway driving. I love the look and the fact that the "S" model comes with all the looks without the premium price. The nit-picks: 1) there is no indicator for which gear you're in on the dash (you have to look down at the shifter), 2) the rotating knobs seem a little cheap when you turn them, and 3) the outside mirrors don't fold away like many others). Other than that, this is a great car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the style, and the fuel economy. Keep the RPM below 3k and you will see what I mean. It is fully loaded with everything I wanted in a 'sporty' car. Keep the tires at 40lbs in front and 38 in back for better mpg. Reliability is on par with the best in this class. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've driven it for 11 months now. 2 months after the purchase power steering started leaking. I had to replace rack and pinion. Acceleration is very slow, but the car maintains the speed pretty well. My fuel economy is about 30 mpg with 80/20 highway/city driving. Because of the awkward rear design, I find it hard to see what's in the back while parallel-parking. The turning angles are too sharp for the car this size. This car also lacks folding mirrors and power seats. Anyways, I think Corolla is a good entry-level car to drive short distances in the urban environment. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The driver's seat is very uncomfortable in a city driving condition. It does not hold you in at turns, very hard to sit on. The height adjuster for seat is not easy to work with. My Corolla LE 2008 has only 12700 miles, but the engine makes a popping noise and a shifting noise when I either put it in Drive or Reverse gear. I constantly have to adjust the side view mirrors to match the seat height. The car gives me 28 mpg in town. It's hard to see the side of the car at turns. There should have been a turn signal built on the front side like 10" behind the head light on both sides. It will be easier for other cars in the lanes next to Corolla to see. Same signal should be on all four sides of the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Good gas mileage and reliability. Will never buy again unless gas is $10 a gallon, due to the fact that the interior quality is terrible, cloth seats rake in the smells, engine power is downright pathetic. Have not driven in signicant snow, but I do not look forward to it since the tires spin out from a stop in the rain. Handling is decent, but body roll is terrible and uncomortable. Good suspension, loud engine but only decently loud from the interior. Good sound system. Good car only for those who care nothing about power and all about gas, as in slow highway drivers. Would much rather have a more luxurious car with decent mpgs and power.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Corolla. I traded in a 1995 for a 2003. Loved the 2003 S, I only traded it in because the miles were high (I drove a lot back then.) I feel that Toyota really let the interior quality go down hill. There are rattles and shakes in the doors, glove box and sunroof. My gearshift wobbles and the felt lining in the ceiling is coming out... not what I expected. I'll still keep the car until it gives out on me, but I'm very disappointed in the interior quality.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We now own 3 Toyotas and we will buy again. This was by far the smartest purchase we have ever made. We are a family of 4 and this is our main mode of transportation. Now that gas is almost at 4.00 a gallon, it takes roughly $40.00 to fill it up when it is dead on empty. We bought it for the mpg and it performs well. My husband uses it daily for work, and he is rather a large person. I would suggest this car before purchasing a Yaris. The Corolla is really a nice car that you don't mind driving if you're downsizing. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2008 Corolla to replace my 1995 Geo Prizm which I recently retired having driven it more than 338,000 miles with its original engine, transmission and clutch still intact and never having been rebuilt! Since the Geo Prizm was a Toyota Corolla clone and having experienced first hand how reliable and economical the Prizm had been, I was naturally drawn to the Corolla, although I did consider the Honda Fit and Mazda 3 as well. I chose the Corolla for the legendary reliability and build quality, the excellent fuel economy, a comfortable, quiet ride and an excellent value overall. So far, I have been very pleased with my Corolla, but the Prizm will be a tough act to follow!</TEXT>

<TEXT>35 MPG, head/legroom similar to my Altima and the feel of driving a Camry. Comfortable enough for my family of four on long rides and enough trunk space to fit everything. We've owned small sedans and the kids were just too cramped. Now, they like riding in the "small car" because it feels more spacious. It's also incredibly quiet, which makes up for a rather plain stereo in the CE. Lots of cupholders and storage spaces - more than I know what to do with. I also like that the clock is separate from the stereo, so I don't have to choose between telling time and finding a radio station. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of standard features in base model: AC, CD, power locks and windows, cruise control, and lots of storage internally. The 35 mpg is the best feature but it's also remarkably comfortable for such a "small car". It drives like something that will last.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have driven many different vehicles since the mid 1960s and cars have certainly evolved over the years. I have also done minor repairs and maintenance on cars. Have owned several sports cars and even a Honda Hybrid a few years ago. The Corolla offers the best of all worlds. Over 30 mpg city (32 to 34), with the standard transmission. A solidly built and realible vehicle, good gas mileage, fun to drive and attractive enough in design and style (the "s" model). While the Corolla may be a bit more expensive than similar competitors, "you get what you pay for". Toyota's reliability is worth the price alone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the Sport to replace a bare-bones 02 CE and absolutely love it. I could find no comparison in the mileage and value and feel spoiled. I see a new side of the Econo-box, you can get a fully loaded comfortable car for a good price. I commute 200 miles each day and love the ride quality and comfort. There is little road noise and so far with just over 7k miles I average 37-38mpg in a mix of highway and N. VA traffic, about 390 miles before the reminder light comes on, trying for 400. I sometimes wish for more horsepower but the motor is still smooth and able and for the mileage I suppose there has to be some give. </TEXT>

<TEXT>First new vehicle we have purchased for a number of years, so we were looking for a great value. I have owned Toyotas in the past and have been impressed with their reliability. We compared this car against the Honda Civic and Mazda 3. We liked the Mazda the best based on design, look and finish, but decided it wasn't worth the extra $2-3K. Honda was overpriced as well. Overall we are satisfied except I hope the gas mileage improves with age. We have been getting mid-20's on a mix of urban/rural commuting and the best so far was 32 mpg on an all interstate highway trip. Driver comfort is not great on long trips. Steering wheel is too far away when you adjust the seat for proper leg room</TEXT>

However, I am not so impressed with the acceleration once the car has warmed up a little... gets a little sluggish while entering freeways too. But that apart, it is perfect for the value seeker and environment friendly drivers (who save both money and gas!). The car is a lot sturdier than the 2000 model. Just close the door and you'll find out!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior looks very nice and is very spacious. It seems like driving a much bigger car than it actually is! Fun to drive. Great fuel economy on the highway.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Toyota (have a Tacoma & traded the Camry). The Corolla S is a sporty looking and handling car, a bit short on the power but what you get in return is good fuel economy. When you close the doors you know you have purchased a good solid automobile. My only complaint is the steering wheel is a bit awkward and uncomfortable as far as hand placement on long drives. Overall, I'm completely satisfied with this car so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2008 Corolla excels in all the important ways. It's nicely styled, it's most reliable, it's efficient and well handling. I've read editorial reviews that feel things are not placed exactly where they'd like, or that the model is not of a 'style' to their liking. Well, they are most welcome to spend their money on flashy boats. I smile all the way to the bank with my new 2008, and all the way down the highway. In particular, I find the driving column and seat extremely comfortable and well placed and wonder if they knew the seat had three adjustments possible (seat height, forward placement, and backrest) as well as a tilt steering wheel. I think they may have missed that .... :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a gas guzzling, cramped Mustang. One of the best decisions I made last year. We are much happier with the Corolla. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage is number one! Surprisingly roomy interior for a car in its class. My wife likes the adjustable height on the driver seat. Power windows and a roomy trunk. Also like the outside temperature gauge.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this car in December and have liked the overall interior and exterior look. I got the black/charcoal interior. It looks really nice and I'm hoping that the clean-look lasts in comparison to beige/tan interiors. I'm really happy with the look. The exterior color is Phantom Grey and it's absolutely gorgeous! It's dark enough to cause some mystery but not too dark if you know what I mean. My car comes with slight factory tinting, though you may want to get a darker tinting for that special look. The fuel economy is pretty average. I think that the last time I looked a full tank lasted 280-miles give or take a couple of miles. It's pretty average, considering it's a 2008.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has been a dream. Reliable, great price and great looking. This car I think is fun to drive. I opted towards the side curtain air bags, ABS (Winter Weather Package) and sunroof. Great gas mileage rides smooth and the engine is quiet. I like the S model because it looks sporty but are not paying the price of the sporty cars. Be careful not to bottom out going in and out of driveways and parking lots! </TEXT>

<TEXT>We are very happy with our Corolla and it is a great economical runner. Roads are rough down here in Mexico and there are a couple of annoying rattling noises from the dash and center console driving over cobblestones or paving stone roads. It isn't an easy starter. Quite often takes two attempts. Very roomy and comfortable for a small car. Not particularly impressive off the line acceleration but in highway driving performs extremely well with lots of power for passing and no down shifting even in fifth gear going up most hills. Very stable at high speeds for a small car. If it turns out to be as reliable as its reputation we will replace this Corolla with another.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2008 Corolla is a good car? if you get a good one. I bought this car because my wife and I really like our 2007 Matrix, which is in essence a Corolla wagon. Both cars have the same engine and transmission, but you would never know it. Our 2007 Matrix is smooth and quiet. The 2008 Corolla has a loud knock when the engine is cold, that diminishes when the engine warms up, but does not go away. When I had this checked out by the dealer, they confirmed it is piston slap also known as cold start knock, but informed me it is considered ?normal? for this engine. I find it irritating to listen to this. I wish I had test driven the car when it was cold, before I accepted this car for delivery.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased the 08 Corolla; traded in an 07 Mustang GT. I couldn't be happier with this decision. The Corolla is peppy, smooth, and handles well. Plenty of horsepower for commuting to and from work in a combination of city/highway driving. When you shut the doors, it sounds as solid as my wife's Volvo. No chance to check on fuel economy, so my rating there is based upon what I've read; I hope to get in the mid to high 30's, however. The halogen headlights are very bright. The four speaker, base stereo sounds fine. I love the simplicity of the design. This car just makes good sense. The more gas prices rise, the more money I save. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1.8 liter VVI engine, very quite for a four cylinder. The manual transmission; gives the driver better control over the available horsepower. Also, it is very easy to shift. I really like the conservative styling (this is the last year for this style).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our third Corolla. Wife had a 2003, daughter has a 2005. When my wife's HHR was totaled she wanted to return to a Corolla as long as it had side air bags. Driving my Jeep was a bit scary for her. We got the LE model with power windows, wooden like interior trim and cruise control. It sets the standard for all compact economy vehicles. Excellent mileage, smooth ride, roomy interior and a huge trunk. Perfect for city driving and for long trips for two adults and a maximum of two preteens. Well put together and indicative of Toyota's pursuit of quality even in an economy vehicle. A great bargain. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Gas mileage is great. Small size for easy city/tight spot parking, yet spacious inside. Has a luxurious feeling to it inside. I got the LE fully equipped: ABS, EBD, curtain airbags for rear, cruise control. Acceleration is a bit disappointing on highway, but once cruise speed is attained has no problem reaching 90 mph, and sounds and feels quite smooth.</TEXT>

<TEXT>S type Corolla has a much more interesting look to it, for those who are knocking the "plain" look of the Corolla, the S package doesn't add much in price but adds a body kit and rear spoiler to jazz it up a bit. Yes, it's still a Corolla, but it's much better looking in the S version. For those griping about performance, it's either gas mileage or performance, not both. Face the truth; you and I grabbed this car because it's cheap to buy, cheap to maintain, cheap to drive. If it had a monster V8 in it and had tons of performance, we would have bought a Civic; we're not happy with 10 mpg. You DO however feel much sportier and more in control of engine horsepower with a stick. Try it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My S type has the power roof, which I like, the body kit and spoiler, which I like, and of course I've been sold on Toyota quality for most of my adult life.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car gives a nice smooth ride for its size. Acceleration is smooth and the transmission shifts great. This car rides a bit high and the driver's seat is adjustable; all nice features. However, I find the steering wheel a bit too far away, making driving a little uncomfortable and the knee ends up too close to the console. I'm somewhat disappointed with the fuel economy (rated at 26/35) when my bigger accord of 1988 produced 30/34 mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sound of the doors closing rival those of expensive cars, acceleration and automatic transmission shifting is really smooth when compared to my 2001 civic. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car makes more sense than any I've driven in years. First tank of gas gave 40.5 MPG! Room for everything necessary.

<TEXT>Things I wanted in my car: fuel economy, reliability, good price, enough seating room and trunk space for my two teenage daughters. My basic Corolla CE met all my requirements and more. Only additions are an after market alarm/keyless entry system for $260, an Obus Forme seat cushion (for my back), and a free front dashboard cover from my dealer. Everything is great with this car - very satisfied so far. BTW, I still don't understand why people are complaining about the "boring" exterior and interior styling. My Corolla looks like a solid car to me - none of those fancy, weird looking "fun to drive" features inside and out.</TEXT>

It gets great gas mileage, is very reliable, and is actually somewhat peppy for having such a small motor (if i wanted a fast car I would not have bought a Corolla).

<TEXT>The Toyota Corolla is not a fast car but is powerful enough for daily city drives and occasional holiday outing. It is more of a touring car rather than a racer or a rally car. The steering is superb with fine cornering abilities. Only the power for engine is a small let down. City driven mileage is 9.86 kmpl but highway driven mileage is 11.0 kmpl. </TEXT>
