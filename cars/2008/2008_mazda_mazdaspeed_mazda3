<TEXT>I purchased this car used to replace my 2005 Nissan 350Z. I got it because I test drove one and people had recommended it. I enjoy tricking out cars and have added many upgrades to this vehicle. It responds very well to mods and it ridiculously fast. People will talk trash and compare speed to a 350Z. Having had modded versions of this car and modded 350Z this car is definitely faster, the turbo is what seals the deal and sounds great when you open it up and mod it with a louder intake system and bypass valve. The 350Z is of course more sporty looking and RWD and a coupe, but having upgraded to this being my first 4-door car, I was pleasantly happy with my purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The turbo sounds great when you add a few mods to the motor. It is very responsive to mods. It is very fast and can hang with the best of them. The interior and build quality is top notch and does not appear to be cheap in any way. This car is a great deal for the price it costs to buy one.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this 2008 speed 3 new but in January 09. I got a great price as the vehicle was discounted greatly to move it. It's definitely the great value that everyone has said it is and yet lately I have found myself at dealerships in search of a step up. The car is fast but the ride and handling don't reach my previous VR6 Jetta, driving experience despite more speed and power. The torque steer is enormous comparatively and the ride and handling are not up to par. I also happen to be an audio nut and the Bose sound system is quite awful. The speakers sounded crappy, the bass bloated and the system has a noise circuit that makes the volume fluctuate uncontrollably. It has been replaced.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cool exterior styling, cool interior styling, engine prowess which is pure speed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My husband bought it for me, I'd not driven one, ever. Love the concept: small 4 door hatch, manual, fast, etc, BUT can't drive it very long cause the seats are painfully stiff. Only had it a day, but probably will sell soon. My butt and hips are literally numb on the sides from the awful seats. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After a year of ownership, this car has exceeded all of my expectations. It is VERY quick and the rush you feel when the turbo kicks in doesn't grow old, and neither when it corners or brakes; this is a very competent car and it's nice they can sell it this cheap. But when you don't want to dance, it will take you home without fuss; The vast amount of torque lets you be lazy and it feels no different than it's non speed brother. I've had no mechanical issues, and love the Alcantara/leather seats, and also it's cargo capacity (40 inch flat screen tv in its box?? no problem). After an unreliable and slow car, this car is what I dreamed it would be. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, braking and handling. Practicality, reliability and understated good looks. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My Speed3 is nothing short of amazing! I have had it for over a year, and I still look for reasons to go for a drive. There is so many good things to say about this little ROCKET, and so few negative. The take off in this thing is amazing. If you need to get out in traffic, it's not a problem whatsoever. As far as gas mileage is concerned, I am getting 24.1 in town, and that's jumping out at every red light. I drive within the speed limits, but it's fun to rocket yourself as quick as possible to that speed limit. The last car I owned was a Pontiac Grand Prix GT. That car I thought was pretty quick, at about 200 Horse power. When I saw that the Speed3 had 263 stock, I was floored! What a RUSH</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>How it forces you back into the seat when you punch it! The dash lights, the head lights, automatic wipers are cool. The 6 speed. The 18 inch rims. The media input for my Zune to play through the speakers, that's cool. Controls on the steering wheel. I can go on and on, but there is not enough room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It doesn't get any better than this. A sleek hatchback design, 18" alloy wheels, humming sport-exhaust, all wrapped around a intercooled, 4 cyl turbo cranking out 263hp, doing 5.45 sec from 0-60 mph. The ride is the most responsive handling experience I have ever incurred. I sell cars, and drive BMWs, VWs, Mercedes, etc., day in and day out. Only the high end Lexus GS, and C350 AMG move like this car (however not nearly as agile) Buy this car if you like sportscars with room for 4 (comfortably), a tape-measure turning radius, and getting sucked back into your seat going from 80-110 mph. Bottom line: the MS3 has the best horsepower:cost ratio (faster than the R32, GTI, Si,& Caliber SRT-4).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Favorite features on my new MS3 include: 18" alloy wheels, scooped hood design, Xenon High Intensity Discharge headlights (Auto-Off), and modified rear spoiler.

<TEXT>This car is amazing! Couldn't be happier. The power this thing puts out is unbelievable. The only bad thing about this car is the gas mileage. But I guess thats just a minor downside to any car with this much power. Definitely worth it though. The 6th gear helps a lot with highway driving. This car can run circles around an Rx8. Any Mazda person can tell you that. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched all the brands and always came back to the Mazda3. I chose the speed3 after driving both and simply enjoyed the fun factor and economy of a sporty car that has all the details I hold dear. The interior is excellent, design outstanding. The firm ride makes for confident handling, the engine a superb powerhouse or a fuel sipper depending on how you drive it. I can trundle along at normal speed and save the gas, but if I need some passing power, it amazes with its pickup that never ends. The torque will pull strongly in any gear and turbo lag is minimal and predicable. I cannot find any other vehicle for the money that gives so much. Get one while you can. $$ will only go up.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Climate control is nice, the turbo engine is a blast. Steering wheel cruise and radio controls are perfect.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ive loved my Speed! Super fun car to drive. Handles incredibly well even under high speeds. Great driveability in the city. I have no complaints thus far and have now owned mine for about 4-5 months. Im actually getting an average of 27 mpg even though the combined av. should be somewhere in the neighborhood of 21 mpg. This car is fast, fun, easy to drive. The clutch took a couple weeks to get used to as it is a bit more touchy than the conventional version, but now I cant drive without it! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Feeling of dropping into 5th on the freeway and watching the speedometer climb! Interior design is great and very comfortable. Looks a lot more pricey than the actual price tag. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Like every other reviewer here, I think this car is great. It just seems like you get more for your money here than in most cars. The power and handling are suburb, the interior is brilliantly designed (love that HUGE glove box!) and seems to be of higher quality than most sub 35k cars I've seen. The car is just all around fun to drive, and with the hatch and the fact that it makes its power from the turbo charger, it's practical too! My only real complaint is the transmission. The clutch is just a touch to delicate and takes some getting used to. 1st gear is only useful for getting the car moving and the shifting is "notchy". I've missed gears. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>*Gobs* of mid-range torque and power, road hugging suspension, comfortable leather/alacantre seats, 6cd changer, automatic wipers, LED lights, the fact that I can drive a powerful and well handling sports car every day. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Vehicle only three months old but have found 0 build problems. I am 62 years old, so probably don't fit the 'normal' buying profile. I don't care! This car is a true hoot to drive. Goes like a bat and at this price point, it's a steal. Very decent ride and the performance tires REALLY grip the road in fast turns. No matter they will probably only last 15,000 miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We looked at a replacement for our '03 wrx wagon. List of must haves: boosted 4, room for the dog, sporty handling, good reliability, and not much over $20k. After a lot of research, it was the best decision even if we're not "in love". The '09 model WRX-GT isn't available yet and the present is a boring compared to our old one. The HHR SS was a player, but not as available on the lots and prices are higher because of it. Mini Cooper S looks dated and could be only worse in 5 years. The is the one left standing. See my likes and dislikes below, but it's a real shame that more manufacturers don't "get it" when it comes to fast efficient commuters. Upscale doesn't need to mean BIG. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>2008.5 has great interior, great engine, pretty good looks with a surprising amount of room inside. Really the best bang for the buck out there.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did a ton of research and found a deal I could not pass up. The power for the money is amazing plus the convenience of 4 door with room it was hard to not to buy one. If you've read ALL of the reviews and research of this vehicle, you have heard it's a blast to drive. And it is. The suspension will greatly exaggerate any small pothole or bump. Especially at high speeds. I do love the power and getting it out on the freeway. In 3rd it really lets loose with the turbo and before you know your doing 90mph in 5th! One complaint - I have noticed a few rattles near the windshield area. Power, convenience of 4 doors and decent mpg was everything I was looking for. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought this car in may of this year. I had the Mazda 3 GT before this one but wanted to get the Turbo version. This car is very fast, and you have to get used to the torque steer when you are shifting. For some reason it always pulls me to the left. Again the car is great, you got your 4 doors with a hatch and seats that fold down. I had a problem with the stereo (volume) had to take it back to get it changed for a new one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wanted one since they came out. Was going to wait 'til spring '09, but this is the last year, so I jumped early. This car is phenomenal! Great power and handling. Not sorry I bought it. Acceptable mileage (it's not a sipper, but it does very well if driven gently). Very comfortable on a recent weekend trip, and the throttle response is amazing!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power and handling, auto HID headlights. Rain-sensing wipers. Great fit and finish. Especially like the subdued leather interior. The six-disk MP3 changer is a plus, as well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned this car for 5 months now, so we'll call this a long term road test. The Mazdaspeed has baggage room and comfort to keep the wife and kids happy, and performance to satisfy the Wild Child inside of me that just won't grow up. I owned a 5.0 Mustang and missed its raw power when I bought an Eclipse GT. Now the Eclipse is gone and the power is back, in spades. The Mustang didn't handle curves well, the Speed will go as hard as I dare, I've never come close to finding its limit on a curvy road. If you look up "bang for the buck" on Wikipedia, there should be a picture of this car next to it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had a number of sports cars over the years, including Corvettes, M3s and others. This thing is in a class by itself in terms of the cost/benefit equation. For street driving, it will do 95% of what those other cars will do, and at half the price. It gives me a big smile each time I drive it, and think about how little money I paid for the performance I'm getting. Highly recommended. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car about 2 weeks ago, and just finished break in. Before I bought this car, I had to decide about sport or comfort. I chose the sporty features of the vehicle. This car is a pure fun to drive sport car. Handling is excellent, and power is off the hook. Even though it is in 6th gear in about 40mph, it jumps up to 70 mph very easily. It is very pleasure to see and drive this vehicle everyday. It's turbo boost starts about 3000 but that doesn't mean that this car have a turbo leg. I test drove GTI before I bought this car, and GTI had a some turbo legs. It is a true sport car with most of comforts you want.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm an admitted car nut and have had the opportunity to drive quite a few performance vehicles over the years. With all things considered, the Mazdaspeed3 comes out at the top of the heap when it comes to performance, cost and comfort. I just knew I had to have one when the car salesman punched the accelerator for the first time during my test drive! ZOOM, ZOOM!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The turbo-charged engine, silly! Accommodates a family of four, exhaust note, seats, 18-inch wheels, Solo Cup red paint, limited production. The exterior styling is not too much nor too little. Anyone who knows cars can tell that the MS3 is something special. I could go on.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The biggest surprise, even for those who have read road tests on this car, is the huge amount of torque once behind the wheel. Just stepping into it moderately in 2nd, 3rd or 4th gear it reminds me so much of a '67 Mustang 390 I once owned. But, compared to that ancient beast, this little jewel is light years ahead in practicality. And it is mega-light years ahead in handling, cornering power, braking and steering response. In summary, this is a confidence-building and unfinicky sportscar with very good seats, great comfort amenities for its price, a very useable back seat area (when in place) with lots of hauling room by folding the seats down - a near perfect practical sportscar to me!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Absolutely incredible roadholding grip with excellent steering response to go with the macho-torque on the stock summer Bridgestones at 50 degrees or warmer. To enjoy this year-round in the snow belt though, I had to get a second set of tires/wheels - 225/40 all season Potenzas on Enkeis. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far no problems. Has awesome pickup, handles just fine. Fun to drive. This car is perfect. If you want to go slow and save on fuel you can but, if you want to go it is right there with you. No trouble passing, taking bends, stopping is great too. I think the way everything is set up inside is great, do not change it. Love the cup holders in the doors in the back especially. It is great for my children. The seats are firm but give great support in all areas. The material is easy to clean when needed. I love my color mica blue. The seats are two toned which adds character to the car. I always liked hatchbacks. And this is not your typical one. If you want a sports car drive this first. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was leaning toward getting a Lexus IS 250 or an Audi 4 when on a whim I stopped by a Mazda dealership. I drove an RX-8, which I loved, but I live in Colorado and it's really not a practical winter car. So a friend suggested I try the Speed3. This thing is an absolute blast to drive. Performance-wise, it's very comparable to a BMW 328 -- it's impossible to tell it's a front-wheel drive car. You can go 80 in third if you want, you can take curves at 60 with no sway at all, or you can drive it sedately and still get a fun drive and pretty decent gas mileage. Plus it seats four adults very comfortably, and of course the hatch is convenient for hauling stuff. Great car at a great price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, transmission, steering, brakes, styling, Bose sound system (note: the sound system had to fixed on all 2008 1/2 GT models -- make sure they've made the repair on the one you're buying or you'll have to take it in to get it replaced.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Unbelievable acceleration and handling for a sport wagon. Great gas milage if you're not a lead-foot. The Metro-Grey-Mica is an excellent color. I've always been a Mazda fan. I've test drove a lot of different cars before I decided to buy the MS3. By a long shot, this car won me over. Best bang for your buck as many others have said. There are so many upgrades that you can do with this car if you have the extra $$. I couldn't be happier with the purchase of this car. I got the GT model by the way. I really liked the leather and red stitching seats, steering wheel, and shift stick. Keep the MS3s coming to North America!</TEXT>

I do not want to give up my G35 and my wife does not drive. After A LOT of research and test driving the MazdaSpeed 3 gives me everything my G35 has to offer plus the ability to seat 4. So I get to keep my G35 and now I have another sports car that does everything very well. Actually, I enjoy driving my SPD3 now more then the G35.

<TEXT>After a day of finding my way around the car, I feel as though I have literally "melted" into my new MazdaSpeed 3 GT. I've never had a car before that seems to fit the driver like a glove. This one does. As for performance, I'm extremely impressed. I've had a Mazda MX-6 GT and a Volvo S70 T5 with turbos before, but neither of them could touch the MazdaSpeed 3. This car seems to know what you're thinking at any given time and just does it almost instantly. Truthfully, this car is just a bit smaller than I'd like, and I actually prefer the overall styling of the Mazda 6. But sadly, there's no MazdaSpeed 6 anymore, so this was my next choice. And I'm very happy with it overall.</TEXT>

<TEXT> After driving the usual suspects, WRX, GTI, Civic Si, etc., I found the MazdaSpeed3 the best bang for buck. The car is very, very fast, once you get into 3rd gear the car explodes. Handles amazing as well. The GT interior is very nice, the seats are very form fitting and comfortable. The Bose system sounds great. The xenon headlights are great at night. The fuel economy is fine for the speed of the car, I'm not sure how people expect a car to be a sub-15 second 1/4 mile car and get 28 around town. I average 21-22 around town and 25+ on the highway. For a car this fast that is very good. Handles Colorado in the winter nice enough.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE> Speed, 6speed, handling, stereo. The turbo is very nice, you can keep the car under 3000 rpm and drive it nice or kick it over 3000 and let it rip. Very nice car to have as a daily driver. Can tear it up or drive nicely. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am in the car business and work at a Honda dealer, but the SPEED3 was my only consideration. Faster then the Civic Si, and much more practical in the hatch body. Build quality is on par with the best Japan has to offer. I get 28 MPG on a 48 mile one way commute with a small amount of town driving, if I keep my foot out of the turbo. But when I need to go, (or just want to), very few cars give you this kind of thrill. Handling is superb, braking is outstanding. The only things missing are heated mirrors and seats, and if you like them, a sunroof. It even did OK in a snowstorm with the summer tires. If you want serious preformance, good gas milage, practcality, and quality, look no farther.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car may be the perfect combination of practical features and all-out performance. I owned a few BMWs prior to buying the Speed 3 in November, and while the Mazda doesn't quite measure up to the Bimmers' build quality or luxury, it is surprisingly adequate in both areas. I will probably keep this car forever as nothing even remotely close to its price is appreciably faster and nothing this fun to drive has as much utility.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you haven't heard, the Mazdaspeed 3 is one of the best bangs for the buck. The turbocharged 2.3L engine is smooth and responsive, but power falls off above 5500rpm. Handling is nice and tight, with the ride being borderline over dampened. Interior quality is good, but I have encountered a noisy seat belt buckle which was easily fixed. The car is just too much fun to drive. Its the ultimate compromise between a sporty car with utility, at a great price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was initially skeptical concerning my wife's insistance on a Mazda3 to replace her aging and self destructing PT Cruiser. After some study and talking with a retired Ford engineer I went for it and upped the ante to the Mazdaspeed 3. I have never been so pleasantly surprised. After 61 years I have had a lot of high performance cars and the Mazdaspeed 3 gives us more performance and sheer fun for dollar spent than anything previous. I expected a much cheaper constructed and engineered vehicle. It is every bit the performance car it has been written up to be. If the top went down I would even perfer it over my Honda S2000. Torque steer is minimal and the power band is excellent. </TEXT>

<FAVORITE>Power! Great overall package, I can't believe everything it has at this price point!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car new w/the Grand Touring package and optional nav system. Wow! Mine is black mica. Body is aggressive yet tasteful, and the 18" wheels and larger spoiler distinguish this car. The controls are intuitive and there are many luxury features (i.e. auto a/c, 6 CD changer, Bose stereo, steering wheel controls, auxiliary input jack). The seats feel awesome and hug your body. The performance speaks for itself. Great handling, ridiculous amounts of torque, all around solid feel on the road. My only complaint is low gas mileage 16 city, 25 hwy. However, bottom line, I love the car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather seats w/mesh inserts to reduce stickyness in summer, red-lit instruments w/ blue backlight, the power, halogen headlights w/height control.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I waited for 4 months to get a black grand touring. I figured the extra 2 grand was worth it for the leather, stereo, Xenons, LEDs etc. The car drives perfectly. It sits low and has tight steering. It's my first turboed car and it packs a wallop. 2nd - 4th gears throw you back. Going from 5th to 6th when merging today was great. It went 60-80 in what felt like no time at all. Finally a car that makes my daily drives fun. Gas mileage on the premium fuel and tire prices are gonna be nasty, but it's all worth it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Adj Xenons, the interior and exterior styling is amazing, the power, the steering, the stereo, the wagon functionality, red stitching, aluminum pedals, the seats, the glovebox is huge, it basically is the perfect car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have over 1000 miles on it and I purchased this baby on 8.7.07 and it is 8.13.07. This is so much fun to drive. I am in the Salt Lake Valley. I have taken it around I15 up to Heber City and down through Provo Canyon. This car can run at any gear as long as you have it in the correct rpms (3000-5500); short band width but she is a beast in that range. Be careful I have also received my first ticket; I wasn't even driving hard, I was talking on my phone and before I knew it I was going 20 over. I am 21 and can't say there is a better car, the closest would be the Subaru WRX, but also 2k more and everyone and their mom has one. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the power, yeah baby!! The interior is nice, stereo is good enough for me, I'm sure the GT with the Bose is way better, but for the price my sport will have to do. Mazda seems to be a pretty reliable brand and no aftermarket parts needed to make this car a real fast baby.</FAVORITE>
