<TEXT>I thought Saturn was the car it was meant to be when it first appeared on the market but was sadly mistaken when I bought a 2008 Vue which has given me nothing but problems since I bought it and I am writing this review while it is at the dealers for major problems for the fourth time in a year. Always loved GM products but this one is a joke. DO not buy one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this little SUV. It's fun to drive, hauls everything I need, including three kids to college, and gets much better mileage than expected (21 in suburban Chicago and 27 on the highway). Too many times to count, people have ridden in the vehicle and asked, "What is this again?" When I tell them it's a Saturn Vue, they are amazed. Several have mistaken it for a Lexus SUV, which cracks me up! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Gets great gas mileage. Customer service not so great. Car seems to have design flaws that no one wants to admit to. Had to take it in 5 times to get the door handles fixed. Inside door weather stripping kept coming off, they ordered and replaced wrong parts and damaged other part in the process. Had to take back 2 more times for that fix. Now the sunroof is leaking, they say there's not a problem, but I've had several GM cars before and the sunroof never leaked from the drainage tubes. Will be glad when my lease is up, grateful I did not purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I needed a commuter with space for some cargo. I didn't like the look of the Rav4/CR-V, and the others didn't match up to the Vue. Full complement of airbags, standard (my 08 Accord is actually rated lower in crash tests than this Vue). No major issues; all minor ones were successfully resolved by the dealers. As-advertised MPG (I get 22city/26hwy/25combined). This is one vehicle that GM should be showcasing as a reason they can and should survive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The design pulled me in at first. Nice test drive. Then things started to go wrong. Cruise control is terrible, it revs really high when going up the slightest incline. Brushed metal trim on steering wheel started peeling off and cut my wife's finger twice. Had it replaced, only to find out the audio controls on the new wheel didn't work. Had a 3rd wheel put on. A few weeks later, the chrome passenger door handle started peeling as well. Had to have that replaced. Gear shifter rattles when temp is cole or hot. Dealer can't find anything wrong.Very limited storage in the back (holds 1 stroller). Should not have even offered a 4 cylinder option. Wish I still had my '05 Honda CR-V.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had our Saturn XE Vue FWD for 11 months now and recently purchased a Toyota Venza which we now can compare it to. The Saturn 4-cyl. is a very good match for this vehicle. The 4 speed auto trans. works very well, but I like the Venza 6-speed better. The Saturn has a very comfortable ride and has a great deal of room inside. The driver sits nice and high and this vehicle has an extra fat steering wheel, which I also like. The as built quality looks to be as good as the Toyota. The price makes the Saturn Vue an excellent value in the market, even as we see GM going through all of this change. I would buy another one without question.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Vue for 14 months and have not experienced any mechanical or electrical problems. The V-6 is a very good engine and has plenty of power. It handled great in the snow last winter. The only complaints I have are the tires seem to be wearing out faster than I would have anticipated even though they are filled with nitrogen gas and maintains the recommended pressure in both hot and cold weather. The rear cargo cover gets in the way of hauling larger items. I like the exterior and interior styling. I'm glad I got the V- 6 AWD. I did my research before I bought and was a little scared that the 4 cylinder would not be powerful enough for the weight of the vehicle</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a 2008 Saturn Vue with the 3.5 V-6 AWD. I had looked at other SUV's but after test driving this vehicle, there was no question that I would purchase it. I was impressed with the V-6 Engine power and the overall construction of the vehicle. The interior design and comfort is incredible. The vehicle I purchased has the electric heated seats and heated exterior mirrors. They work flawlessly in the cold Minnesota weather. I was also impressed with the OnStar and hands free phone system. My opinion is that this is a great vehicle for the money and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great SUV. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I?m very much enjoying my new 2008 Redline Vue! I traded a 2004 ford Cobra so this was quite a difference, but I couldn?t be happier! My mileage was better in the Cobra but the fit and finish and options more than make up for that. I?ve been in much more expensive SUV?s and I?ve got to tell, ya, you?d be hard pressed to find a better interior and fit and finish anywhere close the this price. The NAV system works flawless and the way it handles MP3?s burnt to a disk is second to none too. If Saturn continues to offer this level of vehicle and price, I?ll be driving another new Saturn in three years. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Before 1000 miles the check engine light came on - bad oxygen sensor. Flapping noise in the dash when the fan is turned on to higher settings...not fixed after pulling the dash apart...driver's seat squeeks like an old box spring...not fixed either...a lot of wind noise. Poor fuel economy for the size of the vehicle 15 - 18 MPG is all I have gotten even driving mostly expressway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove the Honda CRV and the Chevrolet Equinox and looked at the RAV4. I'm so happy I purchased the Saturn Vue. It feels like a luxury vehicle and for all the features it's priced very well. Has great acceleration, smoothe handling, smoothe ride, love the grey leather heated seats and really enjoy having XM radio and OnStar. I think the leather seats are worth the upgrade. I parked the other day by an owner of the 2007 Vue. She said she really liked her car, but said she wish she would have waited for the 2008 model. If you are looking for an AWD SUV I'd highly recommend the XR model. Test drive it and you'll be pleasantly surprised.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My family had owned 2 Saturn SL1?s for 11 problem free years. We knew that the local Saturn dealership was fantastic so when my mother needed a new car we took her to check out the Astra. That is when my sister and I spied the 2008 VUE. We were both impressed with the build quality and materials used in the interior. We test drove both the 4 cylinder and the XR V6. Both drove well, but the 3.6 engine was the clear winner. By the end of the day,my family purchased 1 Astra (another fantastic car) and 2 VUE?s. The 2008 Saturn VUE is just fantastic. It drives like a dream, has plenty of power, a comfortable interior, flexible cargo area and many thoughtful features. Definitely test drive it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Way better than my previous 2007 Tahoe because of a bunch of reasons. I honestly don't see any problems with the 4 cylinder on the interstate. I've been up to 80mph many times and it is very quiet and smooth. I live in Indianapolis where it's mostly flat so it could be different in the mountains but we have went up and down several hills and it has plenty of power for me. This newly redesigned Saturn Vue is just right for a family of 4. I had a difficult time finding out if a family of 4 would be able to comfortably fit in this vehicle. My kids are 1 and 3 and they love the aftermarket DVD player. I could see where this vehicle would get tight for a family with teenage kids.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our problems began after 4 months and less than 3000 miles when a p.s. hose burst on Jan 21/08. Dealer said it was probably water in the p.s. hose that froze and burst the line! No hoses available in N.A. so dealer finally stripped a new vehicle to get us going after a week. Second p.s. hose burst Feb. 13 causing smoke and fumes to enter our vehicle while driving! P.S. hose replaced again. Feb 21, 3rd hose ruptures, radiator is leaking antifreeze, transmission leaking oil and various electrical problems occurring. Still waiting on parts and without the use of our Vue for almost 2 months . Dealer does not know what is causing the problems. We are very very disappointed with this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a 2008 Vue XE 4cyl during the President's day weekend sale. Traded in a reliable, fast Passat Wagon - so I was looking for something fun to drive, practical, took regular fuel, and got better mpg than the Passat. Most of my driving is around town with occasional slight hills. The tradeoff in power for the economy of the 4cyl is worth it! We have slight hills in San Diego & I just use the gear hold feature - does OK! Wish it had the 6spd auto from the Malibu w/ the same engine. Interior is awesome - so much better than the Japanese competitors. Lined large compartments all over! Got both premium packages, incl heated seats. Only 1000 miles, average 22 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We had originally test drove the Vue to eliminate it from our list of vehicle options, just so we could say that we had actually looked at all of our options within the price range we set for ourselves. But instead of eliminating it, it moved to the top of the list. Of the vehicles that we looked at, the Vue Red Line was the only one that we walked away from the test drive with that "gotta have it" feeling. It had all the power we wanted, looked great, a smooth quiet ride, and it drove like it was on rails. If you are looking for a sporty compact SUV, don't dismiss the Vue Red Line until you have actually driven it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We went from a Ford Explorer to the Vue. It is a little smaller, but the wife and I both like it. It has plenty of power. We got one that is pretty loaded and the options that came with the vehicle are nice. It is fun to drive and the new bodystyle is sharp, plus it was thousands less than other comparable brands.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Vue. It is fantastic for the money, good mpg, easy to drive, plenty of room. I love the orange color and little touches that make it a pleasure to own, I got $3000 of MSRP and the ride is great. I traded in a terrible V6 Mustang and never looked back. I am very pleased with my dealer and the Saturn product. I bought off the lot, I would have ordered it with some different options had I been able to, but very pleased overall with the purchase. Glad to say goodbye to my gas- hog Ford! (16 mpg)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM radio, OnStar, folding passenger front seat (makes a desk), door courtesy lights, delay lighting and power, bodystyle, color (sunburst), and the interior fit and finish. Excellent value and MPG, I average 23 combo, 27 highway on cheap gas! has a large 19 gallon tank. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I like many of you had condisered other cars; my first favorite was a Nissan-any Nissan. But one day we had to rent a car and we got the 2008 Vue. I was sold. When I went to the dealership they had the Black Onyx Red Line. This car is sporty upon spory. Right down to its red trimmed leather and suede seats. I have received so many compliments about this car but the outside is only half the story. It is fun to drive and it has great saftey features. Especially the OnStar. It has a quiet interior ride with loads of storage space. Includeing the one under the passenger seat. It is roomy on the inside plus it has great cargo space. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just picked up our VUE last week and so this review is based on only 7 days of driving, but so far, this is an awesome purchase! Dealer was great to work with and we have no complaints about the vehicle so far. A 6 cylinder would have been in the running when we bought if the mileage had been a bit better. However, so far, the 4 Cyl has done well in both city driving and on the highway. This is not the engine if you want to run at 200km/hr, however, if you drive properly and are not trying to win any land-speed records, this is the vehicle/engine for you! We looked at the CRV, RAV4 and CX-7 and this was definitely the best-buy of them all! What are you waiting for, go test drive one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Last new car was my wife's 2005 Honda Odyssey Touring which is still a great vehicle for its age. For a second vehicle we wanted a more compact yet versatile suv and first considered the new Honda CRV, then others before coming accross the new Saturn VUE. Never buying a GMC product before I wasn't expecting too much when we took a new V6 fwd for a demo. Its' handling and ride on both local and interstate roads was so impressive especially for such a small suv I immediately began seriously considering it. I looked at several in stock and all of their fit and finishes were flawless, their safety features were state of the art and their styling was very appealing. Still happy after four months</TEXT>

<TEXT>Since day 1 I have had nothing but problems. The car squeaks more and more every day but upon taking it to the dealer have been told all the 2008 squeak and that is how they were designed. Well I am no looking into a lawsuit against them. Anyone else having this problem? I am beginning to think mine was a 30 day return as it had 300 miles on it and I was denied the 30 exchange policy because they gave me extra inncentives which was not disclosed to me, as at purchase they kept reminding me I had 30 days, well not when trying to exchange!

<TEXT>Don't buy the 4 cylinder model if you drive the highway. Local driving is fine. The car accelerates and handles fine, but on the highway it plays the little engine that could every 30 seconds. It can't handle any sort of incline & in the mountains its so bad that I have sought a trade in. And the gas mileage trade off is not stellar: I only get 22MPG. also don't buy with out factory installed roof rails. Without them you can't get an ofter market system. Period. I love the style of the car. If I could get the 6cylinder I would be happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have to admit I was a little unsure when my wife said she wanted to test drive this vehicle. Boy was I surprised. This is the new design and body style based on a GM European design. Finally, GM gets it right. This looks and feels like a luxury vehicle. The steering wheels, console and doors are very modern. Most everything is standard. We have a small child and one on the way so the 5 star crash rating and airbags everywhere really sealed the deal. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Love my Saturn Vue</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have only owned my Saturn Vue for one month, but I can tell you that I am very satisfied with my vehicle overall. As others, I researched the Honda CRV, Toyota RAV, and even the Nissan Rogue. This vehicle is much more stylish then the Honda, and the price is way better than the RAV. The Nissan Rogue had too bad of a blind spot. The Saturn has it all, looks, style, comfort, room, and the gas mileage is not too too bad. I bought the 4 cylinder and it gets me where I need to go in ample time. If I want to pass someone, I can pass someone with ease. You will love how the Saturn holds the road. My insurance went down $33/6 months compared to my 05 Toyota Corolla; Saturn crash rating better!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are the standard power windows and keyless entry. I really like that there is no seatbelt dinger. The interior has nice styling. Cupholders are sufficent. Someone wrote about them being lower, but I like that personally; before I felt as though I was hitting my cup wth elbow.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looked at them all and have owned Lexus RX & Honda Pilot in past. This SUV is the best I have owned so far. Only have 3000 miles on it but have nothing but praise for performance and quality. First US made car in many years. The VUE brought me back. Did 2000 mile trip in first 2 weeks and it was flawless. GM can compete if they keep the mentality they put into the VUE. Stopped by dealership on a lark and owned the car in one day. 4 cylinder just didn't make it, but 6 is a dream. Make sure you drive it before you buy anything else, I know you will love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was not planning on purchasing a Vue. After seeing the quality and test driving it, I was very impressed. I didn't care for the gas mileage, but figured it was a trade off for the AWD and power for Maine driving. I opted out of the original Vue with the 4- cylinder engine. Please take the lack of power into consideration when making your final decision. But, true to their word, Saturn took my 4-cyl. back and put me in to a 6 cyl AWD. What a difference in vehicles. Overall, the Vue has been a pleasant vehicle for me to drive. I use this vehicle for business and drive it every day. When you drive past an older Vue, you'll be proud of how far along they've come.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features would have to start with the AWD. I have never had an AWD vehicle and I am very inpressed. Secondly is the built in XM option and OnStar. I never thought audio / safety options would be "as" important as they are. I can't forget the interior and exterior design. Much improved.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Not much experience yet but this gives insight into why we chose the VUE and our early impressions. My wife and I test drove the Outlander, Rav4, XL7, Vitara, Tuscon, Santa Fe, CR-V, CX-7, and two Kia models before choosing the VUE. The VUE felt more powerful and tracked and handled better. It felt more subtantial. The car simply feels different from the others which might be the European engineering (this is an Opel with a GM motor and rebadged as a Saturn). The interior materials and details are superior to others at this price. Acceleration is quick and effortless,the 6 speed trans is smooth,the ride quiet and smooth. Too soon to rate reliability but no problems to date.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior and interior design and detail. Acceleration, handling, and 6 speed transmission. Heated leather seats and remote start. XM radio and OnStar are nice value added features. Turn by Turn navigation works well - you don't need to spend 2K for the navigation option. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've been researching replacement vehilces for my '01 Ford Escape for ~1- year, on-off. When the Saturn Vue came out a few months back I took a first test-drive in an XE 3.5 AWD. It felt good and was adquately powered, but wanted to test-drive the XR, but didn't get a chance to. Waited until the Red Line's started showing-up and decided this was the one for me. Put down a little more to reduce the monthly- payment. Mine's Polar White, with the Ebony interior. Looks good, feels good to sit-in, and best of all it's a hoot to drive so far. The 6-speed transmission is silky-smooth, with a quiet V6 engine, and just enough rumble coming from the chromed tail-pipe tips, sounds great too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6-speed transmission, 3.6 V6, Ebony leather w/faux suede inserts. XM radio and OnStar are great, as I've never had them before, but plan on keeping and extending service.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We love the looks of our Orange 2008 Saturn. It has lots of power and amenities. I was surprised to see magazine articles saying it is heavy and underpowered. In my experience, the extra weight makes it ride so much better than our 2006 Vue and the 257 hp V6 has lots of power. It is a hot rod.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is amazing...forget what the magazines say! I even saw a magazine bashing it because the middle seat in the second row didn't have a headrest. The car is very roomy and quality interior. The exterior looks amazing and always gets heads turning due to the RL styling. Seats are so comfortable and great quality throughout. Wish the gas mileage was better, but it is good for what it is. I wish they would have put a different engine in the RL though. The new 3.6 with DI and different pistons would be top choice. This engine is an option on the Cadillac CTS with 304hp. The 6 speed transmission is purely amazing. The engine is very responsive and doesn't hesitate to hit the rev limiter.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really like my 2008 VUE. It's fun to drive, has great visibility, and is easy to maneuver in parking lots. It was a great deal compared to other cars and SUVs I considered. I love the XM radio, OnStar, and steering wheel radio controls!I wish I could have afforded the larger engine, because it's not very peppy - especially on the highway. The cruise control is also poor - the car shifts up or down every 10-15 minutes or so, which isn't very enjoyable. I still like it, though, and I have no regrets. If I wasn't upside down on my trade-in, I would have gotten the bigger engine, remote start, and the package that included motorized seats. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Originally purchased the 4 cyl model with all the bells and whistles. After driving it for a week, I found myself almost always using passing gear going up hill. Took it back and switched it for the v6 and wow, what a difference. Ride was much more smoother and quieter. Low end power is great. It will hold freeway speeds at under 2000 rpm. This is my 5th Saturn and it's the best by far.</TEXT>

Rides nice, handles well, is fun to drive and is very suitable for cost- effective driving to work every day. The style has really grown on me, too. There are other similar styles out there but these definitely outstyle the others. Kudos, Saturn - fine job. This is our first Saturn and we couldn't be happier with it.

Its modern exterior turns head and its interior is much nicer and more stylish then the Lexus I traded in. This SUV is a real pleasure to drive. I really didn't expect to like it more then my last SUV which was a 6 cyl. This 4 cyl. is quite smooth and gets good mileage. I do almost 95% city type driving and its peppy in town. There is plenty of room for my family of 4. I got a model with heated seats, storage area cover and mat, roof rails and sunroof - which only added about $1500.

<TEXT>I purchased the XE model with the 4-Cylinder after comparing the CR-V, Ford Escape, Mitsubishi Outlander and Mercury Mariner. The Saturn had the best look to it and best features for the money and the quietest ride - also for the American brands had the best resale value. I have had a few fit and finish issues that the dealer easily fixed. Another posting mentioned a problem with the 4 speed automatic transmission with erratic behavior and gear-dropping to accelerate. Last week during the recall for the "Brake Control Module" the transmission was reprogrammed and works significantly better - like it should have in the first place. Performance is greatly enhanced!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I narrowed my choices to the 2008 Vue and Rav4 months before they hit the lots, test-driving them both the same day. I'd also narrowed my choices between Toyota & Saturn 10 yrs earlier when I bought a Saturn SC2, and for pretty much the same reasons the Vue was an easy choice. Saturn makes good-looking vehicles w/superior color choices, that come well-equipped with lots of luxuries that make them especially fun to drive. I was impressed with its nimble handling, tight steering and solid stability at cornering. The 4000-pound 6cyl can haul 3500 lbs. Between OnStar and standard alarm, it's safer from theft. I upgraded to the premium package, and now own one stellar car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have thoroughly enjoyed owning a Vue. Looks a whole lot better than our old 2005 Vue (the 08 model is easy on the eye). Interior is a little smaller than the '05 model because of the styling change, not bad though. OnStar free for one year is great. XM radio is always on 60's station. Can't imagine so many standard features, figured we'd have to pay extra for all of them. I miss those polymer side body panels. Also miss having a compass. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The multi-adjustable driver's seat is great, abundant headroom, OnStar and XM radio, body styling is pretty, we've noticed many looks and double takes as we've been driving. Very comfortable to settle behind the wheel and go. I like not having to squat down to get in it. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Buying from Saturn was a pleasure. I drove several other import sedans as well as small SUVs before buying the Saturn. We got one with most of the extra's and don't regret it. The 3.6 V6 is quick (zippy) and quiet. The vehicle looks and feels high quality. I'm hooked on the standard satellite radio and the great sound system. Roomy enough for four adults (or three adults and our other daughter the lab). Front seat cushion a little short for tall folks, but still comfortable enough. The cargo net and divider for the cargo area are really handy and easy to use.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our sixth Saturn, our third Vue. We have only had it a week, but during that time we drove it from central California to southern Arizona. This Vue is superior to our previous Vues because of the V6 engine, increased stability, OnStar, European styling and increased comfort. It's a smooth, fun car to drive. The fuel economy is not as good as our last Vue, but that's because we went to the V6 engine. It's worth it. The 4cyl we had on the last Vue just didn't have the pickup you need to pass and get up the hills with ease. My husband loves having the radio controls on the steering wheel and satellite radio. We also love the Saturn service. (I just wish they'd had a red one.)</TEXT>

The first one had huge transmission issues and shipping damage I found after delivery. THe dealership stepped right up and provided an exchange, no questions asked. My second one seems fine, just don't expect to step on the gas and go anywhere quick. The transmission is also extremely sluggish. If you can afford the v6, this would be a fantastic SUV. But if you're like me, you have to live with the 4cyl.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been in the market for a compact SUV for a while and I narrowed it down to either the CR-V or RAV4. I have been waiting for the '08 VUE just to check it out, but didn't have high expectations. I saw an XE 6Cyl sitting in the grass of a local Saturn store on my way to a Honda dealership and decided to walk in and ask to take it for a spin. First time inside the cabin and I was really impressed with the quality of the materials and the seats were super comfy and supportive. It had standard XM satellite and one year free OnStar which was a plus. I drove it on back road and the freeway and was blown away. No windrush and the ride and handling had european characteristics. I was sold! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a Saturn xe 4cyl, Power is not enough for a 3800 # car. Electric P/S gets harder to turn the faster you go, At 70mph a small correction requires quite a wheel movment and that makes you wander from side to side .(Not fun to drive at 60+) Cruise shifts down at a slight grade so much so that i can't stand it and don't use it. The 4 speed whines in 2nd and 3rd before in shifts. I pulled a very very small lown mower trailer got so tired of the whine i used the manual shift button. Up side 22+ mph overall,Looks good in side and out rides firm but nice. Give the 4cyl a good test ride at 65mph+ 1/2 and you can see what I mean.

The interior and exterior are beautiful its very quiet and is very exciting to drive. My other Vues were nice but not stylish.

<TEXT>Great look and feel. The only, I mean only, flaw is the 4 cycle engine. I get great gas mileage but I would sacrafice a few MPG for some more power. I struggles to maintain 70-80 mile per hour on the interstate - the smallest hills, even overpasses, cause a 4-8 mph drop in speed which causes a downshift. Even if you give it a little more gas it won't help, the 4 cycle VUE has to shift down to get back to the cruising speed. If you are not concerned with power and would rather MPG then stick with the XE but if you need power then spend the extra and upgrade to the XR. But definitely get a 2008 Saturn VUE. Excellent vehicle.</TEXT>

The '08 had a superior ride to not only the '07 but every other small SUV I had tried. I bought a 4 cyl so the performance is sluggish but it still has get up and go when you really need it. Steering and agility is great for a vehicle of it's size. Most of all it's styling seems to be a decade ahead of the '07. The gas mileage could be better but keep in mind that it's 08 EPA numbers won't look so bad when we see all the other SUV '08 numbers. All in all the 2008 VUE is very nice ride for an SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently traded in my 06 vue for an 08 vue xr due to an extremly good deal on the 08. Wasn't really sure how well i would like the 08 but i have to say it is a big improvement over the plastic vues. being all steel now the 08 weighs more and that gives it a better ride and better road feel.Drove both v-6's and the 3.6 is so much better than the 3.5.The interior is much improved as well,with less 'cheap' feeling plastic parts. Only have a couple of complaints -1 being the fuel economy.it's about 5-6 mpg less than my Honda powered 06. i'm sure part is due to the extra weight (500#)but also to the fact the the engine is now GM built.and 2,the torque steer is worse than my 06.but overall better</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>love having 257 hp under the hood . the remote start is great in NE winters .Still hate having automatic traction control ,but at least the 08 has a switch that can turn the system off ..has a nice solid feel thru the steering system over the vague 06 .XR has a nice compliment of comfort features .</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>V6 XR owner</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>The 2008 redesigned Vue has an exceptional ride quality. The comfort of the interior is much higher than several leading competitors we considered. The V6 XR is recommended over the V4 because of the vehicle's weight. The 3.6 V6 is refined and smooth. Gas mileage could be better - but a steel unibody and a wealth of standard safety features are worth some trade off. A great vehicle, despite a couple irksome fit and finish repairs that were fully covered under warranty. Perhaps the best product that's come out under the Saturn label. It's amazing that a previous reviewer is trading down to a clunky Nitro rattle-box from this refined small suv.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great ride quality. Solid lumbar support. Good looking exterior. Great dealership service (the best I've had). It feels like a more expensive vehicle than it is. XR 3.6 offers plenty of power when needed. Wonderful to travel in.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this '08 model in January '09. It was a demo but had only 60 miles. I've still has only driven it for approx 2000 miles, but so far so good. As quite a few mention, the front seat could have been slightly more generous. From before I have a '98 Grand Cherokee 5.9L V8 and the only thing that can compare, is the performance! The Vue and I are usually long ahead of the rest, leaving the red light. The Vue is nice and "tight", while the G.C. is like a ship in high sea. Are however more pleased with the automatic AC in the G.C. The VUE's automatic AC feels to be of a "cheaper" type. However, it gets the car cool. And since it's only a crossover and not a real SUV, it has it's limitations.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 3.6L V6. The remote start. Where I live we have an yearly average temp of 86 degrees, so it,s nice to start up and cool things down a bit, before entering. The simple instrument panel is good. No need for unnecessary info! If the engine gets hot you'll be warned anyway. The manual shift function</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my '04 VUE, 4cyl/5sp, for the 4cyl/auto '08 VUE. It was nice at first, but the more I drove it, the less I liked it. The 4 cylinder is not strong enough for the heavier version VUE. It chugs up hills and gets bogged down while the cruise is on. Also, the vent makes a strange noise off and on. The windshield defroster does not work very well. I miss the better gas mileage of my '04 VUE.The sun visors are still as puny as in the older VUE models. Pretty worthless. As far as good things about the '08, the interior looks much better and classier than the older style. But that's about it. I sure miss my '04....</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this Vue to replace a high mileage Buick Rendezvous that was having issues. Not as much interior space but I knew that going in. The Vue is fun to drive, the engine revs to make the power you need without complaining, the ride is quiet and controlled, and the controls are easy to use. I get 25-26MPG on the highway and 22 in town when the WX is above freezing. For winter, I bought four Pirelli snow tires with steel wheels and sensors. This combo on the FWD is awesome. The Firestone LE tires are crap on snow and ice. Winter MPG has not slipped below 20MPG and that is with remote starter use and lots of slow traffic on snowy road. So far at 13,000 mile, reliability is perfect.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I picked up my '08 Vue at the end of the '08 redtag event. It was a demo, so it had a couple thousand miles on it, but that also helped make the car extremely affordable. I love the look and the feel of the car. I traded in a VW Rabbit for the car, so this has 100 more HP and the AWD makes the winter weather conditions almost nonexistent. Despite everything I love about the car, it broke down on me within 500 miles of purchase. The dealership said that the computer logged nearly 900 codes, but that once they were cleared they could not identify the specific problem and chalked it up as symphony of glitches at occurred at the same time. Needless to say, my fingers are crossed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my Vue for less than a month and am not very happy. The first day we bought the Vue we went to activate the OnStar and the button pushed into the ceiling and had to be replaced. It took them 3 weeks to fix it because they could not get the part. Finally after my third visit they took the part off another Vue I hate the door handle on the passenger door it sticks if pulled from the side. The dealer told us it is made that way and that we just need to pull the handle straight out and not from the side to avoid it from sticking (great design there). There is no storage I have to leave my childs stroller at home if I want to carry any other items. I miss my Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very happy with my Vue Redline with a few exceptions. The good: Handles as well as, if not better than compareable, and more expensive, German crossovers. I have driven the X3 and the Vue handles as well. It's obvious when you drive the Redline that the vehicle was engineered in Germany. Even though it has a relatively small cargo area. However, Saturn designed an ingenious sliding cargo net that increases the flexibility of the cargo hold threefold. I was able to pack the family of 5 with $500 worth of Sam's Club groceries inside. The bad: Mexican assembly is also apparent. 1 recall and two minor trips to the dealer are frustrating. But overall good vehicle</TEXT>

The driver's seat is very uncomfortable, and hurts my back. The wiper's don't work well, and make that horrible scraping sound. The rear wiper button is located below the stereo and you have to take your eyes off the road to find it. My major complaint is that the sticker said it would get 26 mpg. I'm only getting 21 mpg.

I bought the 4cyl because of the better gas mileage. I get 26 mpg on the highway and about 24 in the city. Sometimes I wish I had bought the 6 but I find the 4 has enough pep for me and what I need it for, just everyday running around. I love this VUE and have had no problems with it at all. Very fun to drive and I love the looks! I bought the orange one. Even pretty good in the snow without the AWD because of the traction control.

After I drove it off the lot, the check engine light came on. Saturn serviced it and found a faulty electrical relay. A few days later, it was dead in my garage. A flatbed had to come take it to the Saturn dealership. They said my battery is testing fine, and don't know the problem...I'm now back to driving my 96 Escort.

<TEXT>I like driving the car. It has pep and is comfortable. The 40 feet turning radius makes it hard to park and turn around. The V-6 burns more gas around town than I like. I sure wish they had an engine size midway between the 4 cyl and the V6, about 3000cc. On cold mornings the car will not start correctly; it "searches" for an idle speed which it can't find. It will not accelerate until it is warmed up. The dealer and Saturn engineers cannot find the problem. It is 33 days in the shop and remains there. They keep throwing more new parts at it, but the problem persists. It meets the Virginia criteria for a lemon. GM says no other Vue's have reported this problem. Its now a sour experience.</TEXT>

The low rolling resistance tires perform well on highway; the ride isnt as good on local streets or unimproved roads. Gas mileage has been excellent so far, my first tank was 26.3, second 26.5 and after a short road trip, I averaged over 28.7.Still modifying my habits to maximize mileage and keep the "econ light" on.

<TEXT>I drove my last truck until it died. When I had to get a new one, I knew I needed an SUV despite high gas prices, because where I live, we get a lot of snow. I bought the AWD Vue, and while I saw on the sticker that I could get about 24 MPG, I was still excited because my old vehicle got more like 8. I'm not a professional hyper-miler by any means, but I am able to coax out 30 MPG on my daily drive to work and back. Add in the very nice design, the awesome feel and power of the vehicle, and I'm getting far more car for my money than I expected when I bought a Saturn. Their "Rethink" campaign is fitting, because I have "Rethought" my previous view. I love the view from my Vue!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'll admit that the Saturn Vue wasn't on the top of my short list of potential new cars. But after test driving top choices - the RAV4 and CR4 - neither one impressed me - I decided to take a Vue for a spin. The interior fit and finish are much more refined than the RAV4 and CRV. I like the handling and suspension more on the Saturn as well. Price was also lower on the Saturn and had more standard features. So for interior and exterior styling, great XM radio and interior looks, and a better price, I decided on the Saturn. No problems with the car at all!

<TEXT>Searched hard for something in this size category. After renting one for a week, I knew this was it. It is quiet! The car is tight and easy to drive, not floaty. The steering remains on center except for full throttle take offs. I find the seats comfortable even though the seat bottom is a little short. Great attention was paid to details, for instance the glove box is lined with a felt like material to keep things from sliding on plastic and be quieter. The gas door is sealed with a gasket. Wind noise is very low. The headlights even come on when the wipers come on. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Chrome, something nonexistent in most other cars. I have advanced audio with nav and the sound is pretty good. Easy to use once the manual is read. Rain sensing wipers. Remote start. Lots of interior lighting. Chrome on the inside too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only had my Vue for a few days so I can't write much. What i can say is that after owning a Honda, it's refreshing to deal with people who actualy value your business. I researched almost every car in it's class and decided on it because it comes with so many more standard convenience and safety features that anything else in its price range. I'm a big guy and don't have a lot of luck finding cars to fit. The Vue could use a tad more leg room but overall it's very comfortable for me and real nice to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The dash board, it's very European looking and with the tan interior it has wood grain panels which make it look very rich and stylish. Also, the cargo area is spacious and well designed. The vent looking thing on the side is a nice touch too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This auto has some great features for the price and is fun to own and drive. We had to select between a CRV and this vehicle and the value proposition made the final decision easy. The two cars were actually very similar, but the Saturn Vue XE had more features for the money. We also looked at the HHR, but this Vue had a larger-car feel from the inside. While the car is a German design, and built in Mexico it actually had a good US part content. This was our first American brand vehicle since about 1994. The ownership experience is making me think I will trade my Acura MDX in the future for another American branded car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar with hands free calling. Nice MPG for a small SUV. Good fit and finish. Drives like a bigger ca.r XM radio with input for iPod/MP3. Attractive and practical interior design. While some owners don't know it, the console slides forward to make it a better arm rest. Adequate performance for a 4 cylinder</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the VUE because I use public transportation and mainly needed an errand/recreational vehicle--so, mpg wasn't that important to me. Since I'm averaging 18 mpg city driving, I'm really glad I don't need it as my commuting car. That said, the car is nicest thing I've driven and rides like a dream. I have the leather interior package and the heated seats, lumbar support, and climate control is just fantastic. My back windshield fluid sprayer doesn't work, but that's a factory problem and the dealership will fix it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had been researching and waiting to buy when my old car(Blazer) made the decision for me. Wanted the utility but better mileage. Drove major players and decided the looks/features of Saturn offered more for less. When GM decided to let me use my GM points on Saturns, the decision was easy. Thought driving a 4cyl would be boring but it just takes a little change in driving style. No regrets on the 4cyl. It'll run, just makes a little more noise. Got 24.5 on first tank. Interior is fantastic. Love the interior, no GM cheap plastic, things where they should be. Decent base stereo, love the XM. Drives like a car. Realized I'm a car (crossover) guy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This VUE was my third - and sadly my last - Saturn purchase. This brand new vehicle was in the shop 4 times in 6 months: tachometer went out, CD player quit working, car would not start at all ("bad alternator"), and "cluster failure" w/no tachometer, odometer, turn signals, etc. I recently sold this VUE after it was repaired last as it was no longer a reliable vehicle. I have never had this many problems w/any vehicle I've owned, especially a new one. I do not recommend a VUE to anyone unfortunately.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Like everyone else we were hit by the gas crunch so I downsized from by 8 cyl Cadillac SRX which I absolutely loved so we could get one fuel efficient vehicle for our family. Checked out the usual: Acord (noisy and did not like interior), Camry (noisy and horrible handling), Malibu (surprisingly better than expected but still did not do it for me), VW - Jetta came close but too small and Passat too expensive for a VW, plus a whole lot more. Finally found myself in a Saturn dealer and was blown away with the VUE - near luxury drive, German engineering and design in and out, quality materials, handles well and 4 cyl.economy - no it is not a luxury car but comes darn close for the price!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride is unbelievable, Styling is great both inside and out - friends keep telling us it looks like a BMW - Feels so roomy inside for compact SUV. Fit and finish are first rate. Quiet on the road - much better than other $20k cars. And did I mention I love the interior! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my VUE! I wanted cargo room and good mpg so I went for the 4 cylinder instead of the six. After a grand total of 476.5 miles driven, the combined mpg was 27.09. As others have noted, I also felt the drag with the engine shifting and hill climbing, but I let the engine do it?s thing and didn?t try to compensate during the first 500 miles. After reaching 200+ miles, the transition was noticeably smoother and with very little or no drag. Compared to the other small/midsized SUVs I looked at, the Vue?s value, good looks, and competitive fuel economy made my choice easy. The exterior is very attractive with clean, classic lines.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Attractive interior, lots of handy compartments. Front cup holder location is perfect! Comfortable seating front and back. Got all the extras. The tilt/slide sunroof was a must as was remote start. All the creature comforts of my previous $35,000 vehicle and then some, plus money in the bank!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My Vue has been in the shop 8 times in 6 months. The inside of the windshield has been freezing over completely in the winter. I come out of the house and it's frozen. They had to replace the heater core. It has never sounded or driven the same since it came back. Also, the windshield wiper fluid leaked because they made the reservoir and neck two pieces and they had to replace pieces there as well. About a month after I got it there was a recall to reset the computer because apparently some had lights staying on too long draining the battery. Also, I never got better than 17 MPG / 250 miles a tank. They had to take rust off brakes after only 6 months too.</TEXT>

Tons of options for the base price. For the money, it is a great buy. Interior well thought out, very European, which I like. Buying experience was good. Disappointed with gas mileage, but I suppose it is good for a small SUV that carries that kind of weight. You feel safe in the car, that is for sure.

My new VUE XE has been in the shop 4 times in 6 months: tachometer went out, CD player quit working, alternator went out, and electrical cluster failure (no turn signals, tachometer/odometer not working,etc.) Loved the updated exterior, overall handling and vehicle feel, but after repeated problems with this vehicle, I am in the process of getting rid of it as I simply will not own an unreliable brand-new SUV, as this has sadly become.

<TEXT>Good value, style and safety for the money but the 3800 lb curb weight is too much for the 4 cylinder if you try to use the cruise control on the hilly back roads of NH. The good news on the 4 cylinder is you can average 26 mpg or more if you keep it 70 mph or less on the highway. Any hill will cause a downshift and jump in RPMs. The downshift is usually smooth except in the hills. Front seats seem short and drivers foot rest uncomfortable. Ride and handling are very good for the style of vehicle. A fuel efficient V-6 mated to a 5-speed auto would be perfect. But at $4 a gallon for gas, I would still go with the 2WD 4 banger if this is the style of vehicle you want. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2008 Saturn Vue Redline has the potential to be a great vehicle but it falls short in 4 important areas: 1) the front seats are too short, too stiff and not wide enough. 2) the driver seat adjuster is supposed to be 8-way but you can't adjust it to your needs--adjust it upward and you're forced to move forward--adjust it downward and you're forced to move backwards. 3) the car does not hold the road in wet weather when making turns--a very dangerous problem. 4) the gas mileage is dismal: on a good day I get 17 mpg city and 21 mpg hwy. On the plus side this is one of the best-looking SUV's out there. The interior design is user friendly with lots of storage in the glovebox & console. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Redline model is eye-catching, one of the best-looking SUV's out there. The Vue has great soundproofing with minimal engine noise and almost no road noise.

Engine pick up is quick but for this the gas mileage suffers a bit but it's hard to find it all in one vehicle- power, economy and versatility. I would suggest the $595 convenience package as it provides a couple of nice additions- rain sensing wipers, heated washer nozzels and remote start system. I would have liked a back-up sensor or camera available like is offered in the Outlook. Overall very satisfied so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I just bought our first Saturn. Very pleased with the buying experience, which is another first for me. The Vue is an excellent choice for a family of 4 that needs a vehicle with extra cargo room or light towing capability(we will tow our 2 jet- skis), but still want some sporting character. I love the VVT V6 with 6spd automatic! Tapshift feature makes it more fun/engaging to drive and give an extra measure of control over the driving character. The Red Line has minimal body roll, very good handling for an SUV, solid brake pedal feel, good steering feel, and an awesome interior. Seats are supportive and comfortable. There are many thoughtfull touches/features in the interior</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling is very attractive. Excellent interior quality and attractive styling(material, textures, layout, ergonomics are all good). 3.6L V6 and 6spd auto is an excellent powertrain combination. Clean engine compartment layout.

<TEXT>Waited 3 months to write review. So far I like the VUE a lot. Only problem is heated washer fluid doesn't work. Lots of features more expensive suv's have. Read the manual - found out "wow" stuff. Ride is nice. Seats are way too short though - I'm tall. And lack support - feel like I get tossed around in turns. Can't get as much in back as my last wagon. Bikes and recycle cans don't fit. Old wagon they did as did a washing machine and snow blower. Don't care about XM or OnStar - won't renew. Wish trailer hitch was 2" not 1 1/4" - had to buy adapter for bike rack - not it sticks out. But overall it's a great small suv for the price. I hope it holds up over time. Had more but limited space here. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchase our vue in Nov. The first week we had it the check engine light came on and the panel went out. The dealer reset the code and told us it was the gas cap. After another week or two the check engine light came on again. To make a long story short. We have had our vue in 8 or 9 times to the dealer. Parts have been replaced and wire harnesess spliced. We requested a buy back from GM. My wifes father worked for GM for 35 years. The bottom line is they told us too bad. Offered extended warrenty only. The dealer would not even work with us on a trade in. Offered 21000 for trade on a 30000 vue with 3000 miles. I will NEVER buy GM again. Avoid the problems stay away from this and saturn.</TEXT>

I just love my new VUE. The looks is great, the interior is amazing, and the quality is reaching the same quality demanded from an average consumer. The engine is powerful and you can barely notice at the gas gauge, like in the old days. The VVT seems a bit slow to react when going to high revs, but when it gets there you will notice. The heated seats are not very useful down south, but came standard with the trim package. The 6 six speed transmission sometimes is also slow to react, ( My previous car was a 5 speed</TEXT>

The 4 cylinder provides ample power and the gas mileage is around 22 mpg. We expect this to get better as the vehicle breaks in. Time will tell if this was a good choice. At the price we paid, it seems we can't go wrong. The only option we ordered was the Prefered package.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I decided to test drive the 2008 VUE based on the rave reports I'd seen from European automotive writers (GM introduced the car there as the Opel Antara in 2006). I instantly fell in love & bought one although I plan to trade it for the 2010 Plug-in VUE with an EV range almost equal to that of the 2010 Chevy Volt. I'm not an impulse buyer, so I did extensive research after my test drive. Bottom line: IMO the '08 Vue is the best suv on the world market for the money. Only BMW's X5 (nearly the same size/shape) is equal at 2-3X the price!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Since 1996, I have owned 3 S series, an L300 and the 2008 Vue. I have experienced the Saturn evolution firsthand and, overall, am very satisfied with the brand. The new Vue is my first SUV and, so far, I have nothing but praise for the experience. I have been driving it for a week and the ride is very comfortable and the styling, both interior and exterior, is the finest Saturn has offered. I bought the 4 cylinder model for economy and drive 60 on the freeway and have averaged 22- 27 combo. Coupling this engine with a 6-speed transmission would improve the driving performance, though. The increased storage and bigger/better glove box are definite pluses. </TEXT>

Well, after an awful experience at my local Toyota dealer, I went to Saturn. The outlook was far too big for me so I climbed into the VUE, and was sold. This car is such a great value for the money I felt like I was stealing it from the dealer. I got the Sunburst Orange (had to wait 5 days to find one) With a few options, roof rails, heated seats, conveince package it stickered for 22,800 after rebates and a supplier discount only paid 18,500. This car is the best deal out there. Too bad more people don't know about it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have only driven for 500 miles but realize the 4 speed auto isn't great. It seems to bog down when traveling between 45-55 mph, where I spend most of my time driving around town. So I have to always decide whether to live with it or use the manual feature (which is fun but defeats the purpose of an auto). I think a 5 or 6 speed with the 4 cylinder would be better. Also can't figure out why they put a 12V outlet in the rear but only have one up front...and it's in the console?! Even my '97 Explorer had two up front and in the front dash. Need at least one in the dash (radar detector) and keep one in console for cell phone. Otherwise love the look, drive, ride, and fit and finish.</TEXT>
