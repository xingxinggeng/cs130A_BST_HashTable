<TEXT>I have had my Accent for over a year now, I bought it when gas was near $5.00 a gallon. The car is great for running around town in but not so good on the freeway, I am getting 26 and 32 MPG. I still like the car but it has some flaws. The 5 speed is a must but the clutch really takes some time getting use to, the plastics of the interior are the worst I have ever seen, scratch very easily, the ride is quite and comfortable but you do feel most of the bumps and holes in the road. Reliability has been outstanding so far and still have no rattles. If your on a budget or looking for a cheep 2nd car then this is a good choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned the car for 1 year and almost every 2 months it is in the shop. The check engine light is always & the engine is misfiring. Have had to coils replaced. They always say "sometimes these things happen & we'll get it taken care of." The car is 1year old, should have no problems. I would seriously reconsider my options before buying this car. A bus is more dependable. Thank goodness for a second car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car to replace my aging '98 Saturn just under a year ago, and it has been a great car so far. I was looking for basic transportation with a couple of extras, and that's exactly what I got. With the Accent, I get good gas mileage, reliability, freezing cold A/C even on the hottest Texas days, good looking body style (girls tell me it's "cute"), solid feel, excellent warranty, crazy tight turning radius, XM radio (LOVE the XM!), ample room for my 5'8" self and all my camera equipment, and I can almost pick it up and put it in my pocket after I reach my destination. My only complaint right now is the poor visibility in the hatchback when checking lanes before a lane change. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Accent to replace a 2000 Saturn that failed me only after not even a year. I drive over 100 miles a day and this has been a good car for that. I have had the check engine light on a couple of times for a random misfire but it goes out after a couple of starts (I did have the dealer check this and they said it should be fine). I compared this with a Yaris and found the Yaris was more expensive considering the features (and warranty). It is not the most comfortable car but again I drive a long distance each day. I would and have recommended this car as a cheap commuter (though I could have gotten it even for less if I could have been able to wait a few more months).</TEXT>

<TEXT>My husband and I bought our second Hyundai Accent about one month ago. Our first one we purchased in 2001 and it is pushing 95,000 miles and still scampering along (we never had any major problems with the car!) I have been driving the car approx. 62 miles each day for my commute to work and just love it. Even for a smaller engine, it still has pep. The interior is actually bigger than our 2001 and I like the outside styling much better. The only downside is the quality of the plastic interior; Hyundai should use better plastics. Our side panel did not fit correctly and that needs to be replaced but no big deal (dealership has been great!) 27 miles gas mileage 'round town; highway 33+!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is ok if you just want a puddle jumper to get back and forth. I bought this car as a left over 2008 b/c the price was right, but I should have spent more for a better car. The sheet metal body panels ding very easy. This car rattles with every bump, maybe due to the sport suspension. The interior plastic scratches easy, very easy. Plus I am only getting around 20-21 mpg in the city. 25-27 mpg on the highway. I do better with my old awd Subaru. The car is good for parking around town in tight spaces and can hold a large amount of groceries with the rear seats folded down. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car in September '08 as a replacement for my previous car, a '96 Saturn SL2. I test drove this car and the Yaris before ultimately purchasing the Accent. The Yaris felt narrow while the Accent felt much wider, and has a warranty that can't be beat, for a couple thousand dollars less. There have been mixed reviews about gas mileage but I am averaging 30mpg with the manual. This car turns on a dime, and I have gotten TONS of compliments about how cute the car is. (Tango Red - looks much better in real life than on the website). The shifter isn't as smooth as the Yaris, but all in all I am very satisfied with my purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Accent drives quite smoothly and in that way, it fits my driving style quite well. The most pressing complaint I have is its long shift time, which makes the GLS 4-speed automatic feel kind of like a manual. The suspension is loose too, which makes curves a little wobbly. However, it returns good real world MPG figures, and is very economical in other categories. Accent offers plenty of trunk room, passenger area and leg room, rear head rests, height adjustable seat belts, and many other features I probably still haven't discovered. For what it is, Accent is an excellent car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior design is cute. It sort of looks like a "goomba" from Super Mario Brothers when viewed from the front. I also like the design of the passenger compartment (the radio is tilted to the driver's point of view) and the smooth ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A lot of car for what you pay. The gas mileage is fantastic, I get about 32 to 34 mpg. The interior is great but you can tell that the plastic on the inside doors would scratch easily your not careful. I have the SE model and it comes with the stiffer suspension which really improves handling. Acceleration is very decent too because I have a manual. Don't get an automatic, the manual is cheaper, lighter and a lot more fun to drive. (Beware the trunk is tiny) Also buy the SE coupe as its the only Accent model with ABS which has already helped me out this winter. IMO ABS is pretty important. XM radio is great, even has a input jack for an MP3 player. CD player is also MP3 enabled.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked around for a car for almost 6months then I found my Accent! The price the payments and the insurance all fit perfect! I'm 20, live on my own and work full time and go to school! So money is tight but I never stop moving. I needed something cheaper, dependable, and good on gas. My little car is perfect! I can park anywhere and I love my XM. Oh and I had it out in the country for the first time the other day and it handle the gravel roads and bumps great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My radio and the trunk, it has a enter handle so when your hands are full its still simple to get it shut. also i like the seats, they feel secure but they keep you comfortable. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The overall configuration of the two door hatchback is nice because it gives you large doors to get in and out of and large items can go in the back without the limitation of a small trunk opening. My Hyundai only got 21 mpg to start and that declined to 15 mpg!!! For a 1.6 liter engine that is unreal. The wipers did not work from day one and the dealer took over a month to get the part. It ran cold always, the transmission way slow to react and locked up at times. The engine would tach over 4000 on the interstate in any kind of a grade and gave the feeling of going backwards. The service department was impossible to deal with at my dealer making the warranty useless. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The two door hatchback allows for large item to be put in the back the visibility is good too. The car handled very well but hit bumps hard. The standard features on my SE were a good value. (if the car was worth having) the lighted vanity mirrors are well thought out in how they operate.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought my 2008 Accent new. It now has almost 5000 miles on it, and 90% are high speed highway miles. I have had no problems with the little car at all. At 75 mph it gets 31 mpg. At 60 mph it gets 41 mpg. At 80 mph its turning 4,000 RPM. It's a 5 speed manual, and I had a cruise control added. Service these guys correctly, and they should run several hundred thousand miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car as a long distance commuter car. It's a GS model with the bottom options package so I could A/C. 5 speed manual. I work a week on and a week off so I drive once a week 135 miles there, and a 135 miles back. I have also driven this car all over Southern Louisiana and Eastern Texas for work as well, and once to Chicago. The comfort level of this car for long trips is good. The seats do hold on to you well in tight turns. The shifter, steering wheel, and pedals are all positioned well. I have gotten as low as 27.5 mpg and as high as 35.5 mpg. My average 31.5 mpg. I researched the Yaris and Aveo as well and this is hands down the best deal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is fun to drive. It's not the fastest but you make it happen with the manual. The passenger seat moves far enough forward so I can get my son in his car seat in the back while standing hunched over in the car! I'm 6'1". 6 airbags and the leg room. Easy oil changes, I've done one of them.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After a lot of research I found that the Accent was by far the best vehicle for the money. I got the SE with all the options including sunroof/body kit/Auto for $14700 including tax and fees. Just like the one you see in the marketing posters. If it wasn't for my wife I would have preferred a 5M and saved some more. I wanted a economy car with great looks and some options and the accent covered it. I avg 30mpg with DC traffic. Low 27 high 35. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After 3000 miles I'm still thrilled with this car. I've averaged 34 mpg so far with about 70% of my driving highway miles. I test drove the Yaris, Corolla, and Mazda 3 first, but found this a far better value. I also considered the Fit and Versa. I was most interested in a quiet ride, mpgs, price, and warranty. The Accent hatchback is great for these reasons. I was surprised the others had so much road noise at a higher price. That said, over about 60mph the Accent engine gets more noticeable. The only things I miss from my old Rav4 are cruise control and a rear windshield wiper in snowy conditions. Traction with snow tires has been great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my new Accent for a few months now. This is the 4th Hyundai I have owned and Hyundai never lets me down. The best warranty out there. The best price for a small car out there. The 2-door Accent is sporty, peppy, has style and class you cannot find in anything in this price range. I bought the vehicle with automatic and AC with XM satellite radio and CD for only $11,200 including TT&L. No one could come close to that price. Not Aveo, Fit, Yaris, or anything else. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only 1000 miles on her but I'm extremely happy with the car. It isn't a fast car but feels very well built, is fun to drive and is extremely high-value. I drove all the competition and liked the Accent for both the interior layout, quality feel, conservative design and price. It was a good $4500 cheaper than the Honda Fit. Gas mileage was 36 MPG on first tank with mostly highway driving. In town driving on 2nd tank was down around 31 MPG. That could improve with break-in, airing up the tires and synthetic oil. Overall I'm pleased with the purchase. Hyundai has made incredible strides in quality. Fit/finish is as good or better than the Japanese cars. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Don't misunderstand my title, I love this car. But it does what it is supposed to well. If I expected heated mirrors, seats, navigation, chrome wheels, etc. I would have purchased a Cadillac. I wanted an inexpensive, comfortable commuter that gets good gas mileage. I love XM radio so that was a surprise and the fact it has curtain airbags is a surprising benefit. That's extra with the other mfgs. I must admit you have to be very deliberate when driving it, 0-60 in 13sec. Does not a dragster make! But once up to speed it does fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my new Hyundai Accent last weekend. I replaced a 1999 Accent and this one is light years over the old one! As soon as I sat on the driver's seat, I fell in love with the car. It's my first new car and I couldn't be any happier. My dad owns a Nissan Versa and the Accent has a much more comfortable driver seat, and have to admit the Versa it better in the back seat. Overall, I find the Accent to be a great value and an excellent car for a college student like me. I already took it to a 250 mile trip and was awesome!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did a ton of searching for the best but cheapest gas saver on the market today. I considered the fit, matrix, aveo, rio, and serveral others. By far Hyundai makes the best little gas saver out there. The warranty cannot be beat. This is my 4th Hyundai! I have never been disappointed yet by a Hyundai product or service. The only thing I can say is that if you buy a Hyundai in the Houston area do not go to best Hyundai as they are total crooks. I dealt with hub Hyundai in two different areas in the Houston area and they have both been great. I got this little baby for $11,250 with automatic and air and I just love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife drove Accent thru a tough commute & winter, getting 33MPG. She let me drive over 1400, 3000, 4000 & 5500 ft. mtn. passes, getting exceptional 41.5, 42.6, & 45.2MPG, 13 MPG over the EPA highway! Think Honda Fit would have a tough time getting such mountain MPG. At 10,000 miles, Accent is 100% w/no squeaks, creaks or rattles. Although Accent, Yaris & Honda Fit have the same exterior width, Accent has 1 to 3 more inches of shoulder room than Yaris, & a bit more shoulder room than the space efficient Fit. The rpms at 60MPH are too high at 2900rpms. Needs a 6th gear. Engine & ride are smooth. Short shifter coupled to the clutch is the 2nd smoothest combo I've ever tried.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the clutch-shifter combo, recommending this dealer installed option to all manual drivers. Feather foot Accent for excellent MPG. Wherever you can get it, install a High Definition radio, if you have such stations in your area. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this little car. The short shifter and sunroof are great. The car rides really well and is very spirited for a small car. The back seat folds down and creates a large cargo area. I took my sister and niece on a 150 mile journey. The back seat had plenty of room behind the passenger side seat. The back seat armrest and cup holder was Nice. There was no difference with one or three riders. The car rides smooth and very quite. The seats are comfortable and supportive. The rear window wiper and defroster works, the air conditioner is ice cold. Never had to change the radio station. Nice quite car and fun to drive. Get the manual. Filled up before we went needle hardly moved. Tire pressure system.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sunroof/stereo. Simple controls and shifter. Quietness and engine note sweet. Antilock brakes/warranty and design are pluses.

<TEXT>I have only had my Accent (Named Terra) for less than a month and I have to say it's doing me well. The acceleration and power isn't as good as my Ford Ranger but the handling is pretty decent and it has great gas mileage. I get about 27mpg, however, I haven't been able to use it for a long drive or that much highway driving yet. The comfort is pretty good and I really don't care about cruise control. My Ranger has it, and I hardly ever use it. Trunk space is decent as I have been able to fit in groceries for 7 people. Fairly sporty look even with the GS version. Breaks well even without slamming it or ABS. As long as you don't abuse it, then it will love you back!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love how the back seat back rest folds down, while the back seats lift up. It's the best design so far I've seen (Yaris/Fit). Great Warranty! Aux in is sweet! All in all, a really good car for the buck. Best deal for a car out there.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife bought her base 2008 Accent for her tough commute. Thru the long winter she managed 30 to 32 MPG, rising to 33MPG into the warmer spring. The clutch & 5-speed short shifter is the 2nd best combo I've ever driven. It shifts & engages smoothly with little engine drag. As a feather footer I was hoping my wife could get better MPG, but the low gearing hurts just like the Yaris & Honda Fit. I finally got to drive Accent on 3 trips over 1400, 3000, 4000, & 5500 foot mountain passes, to 101 degree E. Washington & to Mt. Rainier. Accent turned in spectacular 41.5, 42.6 & 45.1MPG! If Accent had higher gearing I would get 50MPG on a flat highway. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plain Accent has great MPG for feather footers, shorter shifter & clutch, tach, 8-way adjustable driver seat, remote manual adjustable rear-view mirrors, 2 12Volt plug-ins, very easy roll down windows (forget the electrics for dependability), & standard mudflaps. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My car does not have the XM radio option so I added a Sirius radio to it. I also added cruise control (for $400). In my opinion ALL vehicles should come with air conditioning, cruise and Sirius radio. With the addition of the cruise control, this little car has become our daily driver. My wife has parked her 15-16 mpg F150 and started driving the Accent. We get around 30mpg in combined driving and this car can do 90% of the tasks we need to do when driving. It definitely won't tow my car trailer or haul off a bunch of branches, but it does most everything else just fine. I have the basic white car and added a set of red racing stripes down the side (ala Mustang GT) and it looks great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Needed a small economical car as have been driving a 4X4 PU. I wanted the stick shift as it gives a little better gas mileage. Also wanted the A/C and radio. It is a basic car with not many extras, but at the price ($11500)it is a lot of car. It has plenty of power, shifts smoothly, corners and brakes will. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>GAS MILEAGE. On the first tank of gas I went 250 miles and 150 of those miles I had myself and 3 other adults with the A/C going. I recorded 34.9 MGP. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is the absolute best value out of all cars in this category. Better acceleration and more horse power. Why it isn't getting the rave reviews for fuel savings is unjust. It is a mile or 2 off per gallon of the best econo boxes out there. Given the lower out the door price more than makes up for the 1 or 2 mile per gallon less than Yaris. I put a set of 17 inch aluminum rims and the car handles like a Cooper for a third of the price. Yet is has the same horse power and a warranty that the others can't claim (except Kia which Hyundai owns). This is my 5th Hyundai. I left Mazda and Toyota a long time ago and there is no looking back.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my accent about seven months ago, the drivers side window rattles when opened from just a crack to about half way down, same thing on the other side just not as bad.

<TEXT>I rated this car first of all after being very frustrated. The rattle is not fixed yet, but after having to take a 2600 mile trip, thank goodness for XM. The gas mileage was awesome, I, at one point, got over 400 miles on one tank, of course, filled to the brim. Comfort was awesome, even without cruise, but it hung with the big boys on the highway and in the mountains. I retract my first review.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I picked up my 08 Accent about a week ago, I did about 4 weeks of research before choosing the little Hyundai, The car is fun to drive, looks good and best of all gets 27mpg city and 35 highway. It seems to be well built and comes with a 5 year bumper to bumper warranty. I drove both the 5 speed and auto transmission, what ever you do, go with the 5 speed. Look, it's not the fastest or best looking car on the road but since it is our 3rd car, we also have a 98 Honda Accord and a 02 Toyota Tundra, and with gas coming in at almost $5.00 a gallon I am finding myself driving the Accent every where I go. I paid $13,800 with the rebate for a fully loaded SE, A comparable Civic came in at $17,900. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Hyundai. I bought it for the commute and haven't been disappointed. After looking at the the Yaris, Fit, and Rio I found the Accent to be the best value for the money. At 10,000 dollars and mileage at 37-38,(moving along at 70-75mph) the cost to own in my opinion is better that the 15,000 dollar Toyota or Honda. I have the GS manual with the "popular" package that has air conditioning and the upgraded radio. If you are looking for a reliable commuter vehicle that will last forever and get excellent gas mileage, this is the car for you.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 38 years of driving I decided to buy my first new car. The style, size, performance and costs all come together with this car. I get 29/35 mpg. Accelerate lightly, let the car get up to 36 and let the overdrive kick in. Don't beat it to death. More than enough cargo space for day trips. Checking under the hood is a breeze. All cabin controls are at your finger tips. I'm over six foot tall and have plenty of head, hip and leg room. Very quiet cabin, even with a big truck next to you. Best warranty in the business!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We actually bought two Hyundai cars at once. I had one graduating from UCONN and another from community college that needs a commuting car for her junior year. The price was right and the warranty better than the others. They each bought the version they liked and they are better than the used cars out there. There is nothing on the used market with good gas mileage like the deal we got on new cars. They both complained about the blind spot, but are happy with the mileage and having reliable transportation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my Hyundai Accent SE for less than two months, it is under 3000 miles and has already been at the dealer twice for rattles from either the rear suspension of the hatch. The dealer can't seems to fix it, took it to a body shop with no avail. Driving 80 miles a day, the noise is VERY annoying. I was told if they can't correct this time, I would have to "Deal With It".

<TEXT>Honestly, I was set on buying either a Nissan Versa or Sentra but now I see that my Hyundai Accent was a great choice and is a great starter car for me because of the great gas mileage it gets and it is compact with all the necessary options. I especially love the radio because of the bigger screen and the XM. Most of all I feel safe driving it even though it is smaller than most cars. It has great control and sustains the bumps and potholes on the streets. Overall, I would recommend any student driver to purchase this car because it is affordable and has mostly everything you need.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So today I bought my 2008 Hyundai Accent in the bright green. I think it's called candy apple. Anyway, I have put all of 5 miles on it so I will be writing a follow up review but thus far I absolutely love it. It has an aux jack which is a plus, 90 days free XM and great fuel economy. I would opt for the SE if possible because of the extra features but they didn't have one so I settled and do not regret it. It is a little slow to accelerate which any one of these reviews will tell you, but the fuel economy makes up for it. As far as ride goes it's great. It's my first Hyundai and I am super happy. Just do your research because that's what smart car buying is. I hope this was helpful. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always driven either a large sedan or suv. I thought that a small car would be uncomfortable,slow and poor quality. Boy! Was I wrong! The Accent that we purchased is quick, made of great quality and is as smooth as any large sedan or suv that I have ever owned. Let me clarify quick. I took this Accent on a short road trip to California from Las Vegas. I was able to cruise at around ninety and I was passing much large and more expensive cars along the way and in L.A. The best is now I put in $25 of gas every eighth day instead of $50 every three days. I did look at other small cars such as the Toyota Yaris and the Chevy Aveo. I found the Accent to have a better value and warranty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the car about a month ago, and I've enjoyed every minute of driving it. It handles much better then other small compact cars that I have driven. The gas mileage was the biggest reason for purchasing this vehicle. 38mpgs highway, you can't beat that. Its a very fun and peppy car to drive and the 'Mellow Yellow' color just adds to the fun. The only thing i had to get used to was the blind spot. Very large blind spot. Overall though, very impressed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive about 70 miles per day to work and back, and my 90 Montero had over 200K , so I went for it. I am totally happy with it, no complaints whatsoever. I am averaging 37-38 MPG on every tank. I am a consistent, conservative driver who has kept a record of every drop of gasoline since 1959 that I have bought. Nothing has ever compared to this car mileage wise, and it is surprisingly fun to drive as well. With a price of $10,000 including A/C, I recommend it to anyone who needs fuel economy combined with a high quality vehicle (10 yr/100K warranty thrown in) that is fun to drive. I normally keep them until they die, and hope to have this one at least 10 years. Go see your Hyundai dealer now</TEXT>

After checking VW rabbit, Scion XD, Honda Civic and Lancer, I drove the Accent SE as I always liked the looks and still own a Santa Fe with 70000 miles. It has respectable power and the SE handles very well. The 5 speed B&M shifter is smoother than the Mazda's and is very comfortable and quiet on the road. Interior is spacious and fit and finish is very good. I'm averaging over 30 miles per gallon so far in combined city/highway driving.

<TEXT>While out shopping for price and value, I happened to get lucky with the '08 Accent GS. While the one I bought has little more than a stripped base car, it's well-made, handles better than it should and is a comfortable, peppy little car. Best of all, for a guy 6'4" there's not only room for long legs but also I can even get in wearing a hat! Right now recording about 25-27 MPG in mixed driving, far better than the EPA estimate. But in Tampa, visit another dealer than Courtesy. And watch out for "full disclosure" financing presentations that try to run up the price, especially for unnecessary, rapacious "gap" insurance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was seriously considering getting a Toyota Yaris until I stumbled across this car. The Accent offers more standard features than the Yaris: arm rest, adjustable height drivers seat, tachometer, 6 air bags, split fold down rear seat. The construction quality is superb. And the warranty is unbeatable. The car is peppy and very nimble in traffic. It is especially good on curvy roads. Shifting is smooth. It hugs the road. It also gets good gas mileage. This car is equal to anything being produced by Toyota or Honda. And it is very fun to drive.</TEXT>

I have found it with the 2008 Hyundai Accent GS in the new color for this year 'Mellow Yellow'. This car is so fun to drive.
