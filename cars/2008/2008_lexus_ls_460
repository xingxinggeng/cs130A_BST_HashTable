<TEXT>My wife and I originally went into the Lexus dealer looking for a new GS. The salesman took us for a ride but said upfront that the car may be a little small for me. I am 6'5 and broad shouldered. He was right and the car was a bit cramped. While we were waiting for him to return with the keys my wife saw the LS460 and said she loved how that one looked. I of course responded that it was also the most expensive! When our salesman returned we said we would also like to drive the LS. Of course there was no comparison and we bought the LS. It is just the perfect car. So fast and incredibly comfortable. The interior is the nicest we have ever seen baring none. Highly recommend it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The high horsepower engine is amazing, blue tooth and hard drive are great. Mark Levinson sound system is truly unbelievable. 19 speakers! Remote controlled window and sunroof opening is great too. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great car, smooth and comfortable ride. Great mileage - have driven ~5200 miles and have gotten ~22mpg in city and ~30.5 mpg on a 475 mile trip from NC to KY via the Virginia/WV mountains. Worth every penny (since I got it for a discount buying a new 2008 as the 2009 models were coming in).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love driving it on the highway. Very smooooooth. Love the interior comfort & am content with the outside styling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After a year with this car, it has been very dependable. However, like with most other owners, the side wind noise drives me batty. And calls to Lexus say that it is a design problem, that nothing can be done about it, and the problem won't be addressed until about the 2011 model year. Bummer. Also, the complete lockout of nearly every navigation feature while in motion renders the system nearly useless. Don't waste the money on this. Buy a Garman instead.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent sound system when the wind noise doesn't overpower it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First off this is my fourth Lexus. The car is great as far as comfort, handling, and performance. My major complaint is the difficulty of modifying the navigation system while the auto is in motion. I understand the safety ramifications, but when you have a passenger in the front seat this should be disarmed. I was pleasantly surprised with the gas mileage...I've actually hit 33 miles per gallon with this car, which to me is unheard of with this large of an engine (and considering how fast I drive). The navigation system is not logical. The Acura RL I recently traded in was very intuitive, this one, the driver actually has to arrange his thoughts before hitting the "talk" switch.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned a BMW 3 series, 540i, MB SL 500 and a Porsche 911 C4S. The LS is no Porsche of course but it is the "Porsche" of luxury sedans in my opinion. The ride, power, and luxury are at the top and the reliability is a good feeling to have. The performance is very good for a large sedan, not as good as the 750, but pretty close. For the money, the LS 460 L is by far the best purchase I could have made in this segment. unbelievable car, go and get your own yow won't regret it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my 2008 LS and am extremely impressed. The two things that absolutely stand out are the following: interior styling and fit and finish, and the smoothness/quietness of the ride at any speed. Clearly Lexus is well known for both of these attributes but on a daily basis they continue to impress. I shopped the 7, S550, A8 and all of them are very fine cars but none of them though outdo the LS is the aforementioned categories. AND - the LS is 20k less than all three of those models. Bottom line : An extremely fine vehicle in every sense that tries not to scream "I am rich".</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased in Sept. My first Lexus and am still excited to drive it everyday. Very quiet and comfortable and it has plenty of gadgets. The sound system is unbelievably good. I am currently getting around 27 mpg, mostly highway. I haven't had any problems or have had it serviced yet and so a good service visit will put it over the top.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mark Levinson sound is number one followed by all the other gadgets.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 6th Lexus and like all the others it is performing well and is totally reliable. Although a big car the fuel economy is very good. On my regular highway journeys I get 28-29 mpg. Average mixed around town and highway this only drops to about 24mpg. The park assist steering is too complicated to set up and responds too slowly for it to be useful, but it is a fun feature. This is truly a luxury car which is quiet and a pleasure to ride in. The extra rear legroom is always appreciated when I carry passengers.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything is well thought out for driver comfort, but especially the rear view camera, parking hold, navigation system, vented seats and Lexus Link. The sunroof wind deflector protrudes just a little too far and causes wind roar. If it is lowered one eight inch, with your finger, it is much quieter.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Extremely comfortable, quiet and smooth car, yet surprisingly powerful and fuel efficient, a great car for commute and family trips, can't find anything wrong with the car. Lexus service has been excellent, no complains at all! This is my first Lexus and I'm very happy with it so far. ML audio is superb, got to get it if you want good music while driving!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My second LS,and as expected, quite satisfied with the overall performance, and comfort. I only have 1600 miles at this time, and have had no bad experience with wind noise. Average miles in the city 21, and 28 on the hwy. Only regret was not getting the Mark Levinson system.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Lexus, and have owned several cars previously. This is probably the best car I've ever purchased. The one flaw is the input control on the nav system, you have to stop the car. If it was a way to design the system so that if the passenger seat is occupied, the the passenger would be able to operate the system. just a thought, otherwise, very nice and enjoyable vehicle to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The best feature is the to me is Mark Levinson stereo, best sound I've heard in a vehicle. In addition the parking sensors are a great idea.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>True luxury vehicle with no real drawbacks. Acceleration excellent at all speeds and driving conditions. Went with all the bells and whistles. No wind noise experienced at highway speeds so far. Driver feedback from steering wheel could be greater compared to a M45 or 5 series. Liked LS 460 ride and street acceleration much better than considerably more expensive 7 series. Much more luxurious and larger than 5 series or M45. Great mileage so far. Fit and finish are excellent. Only driven 1500 miles so far but includes lots of driving including highways and rough back roads. Extremely comfortable.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Blue tooth phone, navigation, rear camera, retractable mirrors, parking sensors and Levinson sound are all excellent. Upgraded front and rear seats are all adjustable, with memory settings and separate heat and cooling functions. All seat functions work well. Most controls are intuitive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my sixth Lexus vehicle and the best of all with the Executive Package. It is a solidly well built and quiet vehicle with absolute comfort and interior design, especially in the rear compartment which almost resembles the cabin of a private jet. Despite its 4300 lb weight, I get about 20 mpg around town and 30 mpg highway, depending upon traffic conditions. Its power is impressive as well as its 8 speed transmission which is seamlessly smooth. One minor drawback is the roughness of downshifting at 30 mph. Handling is good for the most part, except for some slight pitching on turns which is to be expected due to its size. Overall this car has everything one could ever want. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I waited until my 5000 mile service to evaluate. This car makes me feel like I'm sitting in the lap of luxury! Wind noise issues are being taken care of with new side window glass later this week. Biggest negative is that the navigation system features are rendered virtually useless while driving. It is silly to have to stop the car in order to find a nearby restaurant choice or gas station. This should be allowed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Levinson sound system. I seldom in the past have even bothered to listen to sound. But this one is so unusually excellent and crisp, I love it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 4th Lexus and my first LS and it won't be my last. This is a true work of art and a brilliant machine. The car rockets from zero to 60, opens up and is cruise-like at 70 MPH plus. The ride is so quiet and serene it is easy to forget you are actually in a car even at high speeds. The LS is unbelievably quiet even at all speeds & in the city. Even driving at 50 MPH with the sun roof open is quieter than most vehicle with a closed sunroof. The interior is impeccable and is likely nicer than many living rooms you will encounter. The car surrounds you in luxury at every turn from the plush heated/vented seats and roomy feel to the easy to reach controls and tech features. Overall a gem.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mark Levinson is utterly brilliant in this vehicle, large screen for nav unit, power trunk, rear sunshade, parking sensors great for tight garage parking, backup camera and bluetooth sound quality is top notch. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>While I'm a little confused looking at the EPA estimated miles-per-gallon performance, I certainly do enjoy the performance of my LS. Around town, including a 25-mile interstate trip once a week, I'm enjoying 19-21 mpg. On a highway trip when traffic is moving, I can almost achieve 32 mpg, and that's at 75-80 mph. Except for a trunk opener failure, this is an unbelievable machine. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite has to be the 8-speed transmission, hence the good gas performance. In addition, the many safety-and-convenience features -- back-up camera, auto door closure, park-assist warning signal, push-button start -- are so helpful. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have taken several long trips, and the car has handled like a dream. I averaged about 27.8 mpg driving 78 mph. I arrive w/o feeling road weary. The only area of disapointment is the Voice Command System. Lexus needs to go back to the drawing board and make changes. I suggest the computer be programed to accept the zip code since it is often incapable of understanding the city name. I have on several occasion made a game out of it by allowing other passengers to get the computer to accept their commands, most often with no success. I strongly dislike having to stop in order to program.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great ride, very comfortable, plush cockpit. In my opinion the best looking and most comfortable large car on the road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Took this car on two long trips, to Washington, DC and Florida, and now have 4000 miles on it. At highway speeds, there is significant wind noise. Also, unlike my earlier 1994 model LS 400, it feels lighter on the road. I don't feel any pride of ownership. Yes, it gets good gas mileage: 29 miles on the highway. But no feel for the road, and wind noise is simply awful. I miss my BMW. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Lexus. I've owned a 1996 Lexus coupe, a 2001 LS 430, and now a Lexus LS 460. I believe the 460 is both smooth and powerful. I like the wind tunnel design and the 8 speed transmission. I also drive a 2006 Corvette coupe. This car accelerates with a rush, and the controls are where they were on the LS 430. I like the changes to the navigation system, the bluetooth phone and the hard disk on which to record my music.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features (I am still learning and reading the huge manual) are the style, the workmanship and the engine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Our 4th Lexus over the past 14 years, and clearly the best ever. Previously drove a '98 GS 300 for 10 years and considered the '08 GS. In the end, nothing compared to the overall comfort, performance, quality, features and styling combination offered by the LS. It is an expensive "value" compared to many other cars in the same or higher price ranges. I recently turned 40, and wasn't sure if I was "old enough" yet for the LS based on the styling of older models. The 2007 / 2008 is a significant improvement in every respect and I have no regrets whatsoever for going luxury instead of sports/luxury. Levinson stereo is incredible and navigation is better than most reviews indicate. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2001 LS430 which I loved, but it was time to change, so I went out to drive a couple of vehicles. After driving and reviewing a couple of other vehicle options, none could compare with the quality and value for the price of the 2008 LS460. It drives smoother, better and faster than the LS430. The interior is quieter than any car I have ever been in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased a new 2008 Lexus LS460 in mid- December. I thoroughly enjoy driving this car. I owned a 2001 LS430 prior to the LS460, and I could not imagine a better made, more luxurious car in the price range. However, I believe that the LS460 handles better and has a sleeker design than the LS430. I especially love all the new amenities, such as the backup camera and 8-speed transmission sport settings.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had an '01 E430 for the past 5 1/2 years and decided to move away from German cars in general, mostly because how often it needed to be seen by a mechanic (and it is never a cheap visit). Ironically enough, I orginally went to look at the GS first but it took only 1 test drive for me to know the LS was it for me. I looked at pretty much all of the other cars out there, but this was the best deal for the money. Keep in mind, that this car competets with the S Class and 7 Series BMW, but is much cheaper. All of my friends love this car and I get so many complements on its beauty. You are not doing yourself justice if you have the money to spend and don't test drive this one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seriously fast car. Gets almost 30 mpg on the highway when you throw it in 8th gear. The amount of leg room in the back seat is amazing My girlfriend has back problems and loves the plush leather seats (she hated the Benz). Gigantic trunk. I swear the car floats when you drive it. Incredible.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After having driven a Mercedes E-Class for the last seven years, I fell in love with this Lexus. I had initially planned on purchasing the GS model, but felt that it did not have enough headroom for me. After testdriving the LS, I knew that it was the perfect car for me! With the exception of the two suggested improvements noted, I love everything about this Lexus. It seems that Lexus considered even the most minute details when they designed this car, in order to create a ride as close to perfect as possible!</TEXT>

<FAVORITE>I have everything except the Advanced Parking. I know how to park so I couldn't justify the additional expense. The stereo system is a major upgrade from my 430.

<TEXT>Extreme comfort, reliability, and a smart layout internally. Reasonably quiet ride. Lexus separates you from the road so expect a different feel if you're previously a BMW or Audi owner. Gas mileage is better than I expected but it's not about fuel efficiency if you buy a 460, it's about the ride. I call it a "magic carpet ride". I am very pleased.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Waited for 2008 model because of the wind noise, grabby brakes I read for 2007, but I have this car for a month now and I don't see any of these complaints. The LS 460 is smoother, slightly quieter and faster than my 2001 LS 430, although there is a little engine noise on low speed which I think is the current design. The brakes are as good or better than my LS 430. The rear seat leg room is more than enough. I don't see this small footrest complaint for 07, this car is simply the best.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just traded from years of driving BMWs and Mercedes for my first Lexus, the LS 460 with all the options except laser cruise. It is a nice car with great creature comfort features, but is it really worth the price tag compared to the build quality of german sedans (the jury is still out with me!!)? There is a lot of wind noise that should not be in a car of this price! It handles surprisingly well for a large sedan and gets great gas mileage for such a powerful engine! </TEXT>

<TEXT>After reading about the quality issues of the BMW 750 and Mercedes sedans, I bought the Lexus 460. Lexus 460 developed engine trouble after the first 100 miles or so. The car started shaking badly, even at idle. After phoning the dealer, we limped home. Tonight, the dealer picked up the car with a flat-bed truck and took it away.</TEXT>

The noise and interior vibrations will beat you to death. The sound system and power door locking system is fantastic. The navigation system cannot be added to or changed while you are moving - very poor "feature". My wife has an Acura with a much better nav system. </TEXT>
