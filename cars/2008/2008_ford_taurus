<TEXT>Took car in for 20K check up after having it inspected 6 months earlier. Found out that my rear brakes and rotors are bad. Asked how rear rotors would go bad after 20K miles. Was told manufacturing issue but they were not responsible. Also need new tires after 20K. Want to buy American but looks like Toyota may be getting a new customer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned Ford's for the past 30 years and I must say this is by far the best one. Among those Fords was a Lincoln Town Car signature series loaded and theis Taurus has it beat by a mile. Gas mileage is great (29 hwy 22 city). There is more room in this car then in the conversion van I use to own. Comfort is beyond reproach. I always buy used cars about one or two years old and add on extended warranty. I do not think (hope) I will need my 100,000 mile warranty on this vehicle. It is just great. Ford you need to bottle this up and keep it on the shelf for future models. Now is I could only figure out how to put a SHO engine from a 2010 into this 2008 I will be happy. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything. Response, comfort, ride, trunk space, leg room in the rear seats, gas mileage, price, and on and on and on. Also I have a rear spoiler on this Ford that was on it when I bought it. Boy does that look cool. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I liked the Taurus from the first time I saw it. Not impressed with the gas mileage though. I average 18mpg. The engine is strong, smooth ride, plenty of interior room and trunk space, nice stitching on the seats. The stitching is darker than the camel color seats I have which makes cleaning easier. The trunk space has as much room as my 2007 Explorer minus the height. I am totally satisfied with this vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior and trunk space is awesome. The 18" wheels are cool. Cupholders for everyone!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first Taurus was a 97 model. It currently has over 215k miles on it with no major issues and is still going strong(we did not trade it in). That's the main reason we decided on the Taurus when it was time for another vehicle. We have only had it a few months but we are well pleased with the new design. It's comfortable on long trips even for my 6ft frame and is a pleasure to drive. The dual air, multi disk cd changer and other new amenities make road trips much more comfortable. The huge trunk also makes it easier to bring everything we need. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Large trunk, comfortable seats with lumber adjustment, plenty of cup holders front and back, Power Moon Roof and putting the Power supply and accessory plug in for MP3 player inside the center console keeps everything out of the way while you are driving. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased a one year old Taurus SEL with leather and the major convenience group (auto climate control, 6 CD changer etc.). Overall, I have been extremely pleased with the car -- absolutely no problems. I have a couple of previous Tauruses, most recently an '06 SEL and there is no comparison to the current version. The older cars were OK, but they were basically appliances to get you from point A to point B. The current version is much more refined, favorably comparing to near-luxury cars such as the Toyota Avalon and for a bargain price! (No kidding, when guests ride in the car, they are surprised to find out it's a Taurus). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Maybe, I'm getting old (55), but I do like to upright driving position. Some people have commented on the fuddy-duddy appearance, but I like the clean look (kind of like a large VW Passat)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought a used '08 Taurus with 1K miles. I think that this is a very underrated car. The interior is well finished with lots of features. Power is decent and fuel economy is better than expected. This is a lot of value for a VERY affordable price. It is a better car than Camry and Altima. It is very spacious in both interior and trunk. Drive one before you buy Japanese and you might be in for a surprise.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good engine performance/economy. I like the space and price for what you get. The interior is much nicer than Japanese competition with leather, dual A/C and CD changer.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only had this car now for five weeks, and I'm really getting to enjoy its comfortable ride. Although I'm the only one in the household, I chose this vehicle because of its high rating, its likable style, in and out. It's a fun car to drive and can't wait to take it on a trip. MPG for me are 24 mixed city/highway, hoping for 30+ on the highway. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Happy with 1st Ford</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I am so happy with my first domestic. This has been the most reliable car I've owned, better then Toyotas and VWs I have owned. Almost 30K miles, and just perform maintenance. Highway mileage is best at 60- upper 20's, city is not great, but this is a 2 ton plus car (4075 with AWD loaded -C&D article) with 263 horsepower, larger than any Toyota or Honda by 400-500 pounds with AWD, so gas mileage for its size is commendable. It is not a Corrola or camry 4 cylinder, and honda and Toyota V6 cars, including the Avalon, are much smaller regardless of class (400-500 pounds), and they do not offer AWD. Taurus feels more stable at fast highway speed, especially with cross winds than other sedans.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort, outstanding reliability, value, Sync, easy to use, visibility is best of any sedan, safety, acceleration for its heft. Even though this is an updated 500, I like the large interior, the high seating position, the enormous back seat, the huge trunk, and even the useful rear wing wondows.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Getting 26mpg at steady speed of 62mph. I assume those getting better mileage have 2wd version. Performance adequate. Main reason to purchase this car was that leg room in rear seat, even with driver seat back, is excellent. We were unable to find any other sedan with enough leg room that even average adults can ride in the back seat for extended trips. They all seem to have yielded this market to mini-vans, which I don't car for. Can't figure out lack of automatic headlight switch. Even our $10,000 cheaper Chevy Cobalt had that! Now we are out of the habit of turning on lights at dusk and catch ourselves driving with them off at unsafe times. Nature's ugliest shade of brown on dash.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Disapointed</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I've had my Taurus SEL for 1 year and 2 months and put 17K miles on it. Other than the engine noise around town & the reliability, I like the car, but the reliability is to the point I'm looking to buy Toyota or Honda. I get 24 on the highway, unlike 30+ as others say. The good: Nice design. Nice interior. Nice headroom. Good long distance car. The bad: In the year I had it, it's now been in the shop 8 times to fix problems. Currently in shop for 2 days to fix loud tapping noise when air is turned on/off. Last week it was in shop for 2 days to replace bearings on struts. A month before, replaced other bearings..all for squeak/grinding noise. Replaced rubber seal around door. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We still own a 1994 taurus, and when we need a new car we bought this one. My what a great car, and its american. It is very quiet which was one of the most important factors as we looked around. The new engine seems to have plenty of power. The only thing I don't like is, I wish it had more room for your feet. Other than that the steering wheel tilt is kind of strange, two postions. My old Taurus has more.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive 42k+ miles a year so yes I drive a lot. After having some unexpected problems with my Camry I figured I'd give a Ford a try. Let me start out by saying this was a replacement for an 07 Camry XLE V6. My wife has a 08 Accord EXL. First of all it is so much more comfortable, my mileage is 28.5 on the highway and 20 in town. It has power to spare. It runs and drives worlds ahead of both my Camry and my wife's Honda. My Camry had 88k on it when I traded it in. Many problems with engine, cv issue, had rotors replaced under warranty, and tranny leaked at 85k. Was not cheap to repair. I am approaching 102k and have never seen a dealer for anything but regular maintainence. Unreal</TEXT>

<TEXT>Although this it's technically my mother's car, I do most of the driving and this car is amazing! I had a '92 Taurus and this car is light years beyond it. The engine is smooth and powerful (you can't hear it running, I have to look at the tach to make sure sometimes). Very good fit and finish as well, interior is comfortable but my only gripe for the whole car is that the driver's side needs more room for your feet side to side. AWD is great, I was driving through snow banks, where my old FWD got hung up every time, with ease. No wheel slippage that I could even detect. Perhaps the best thing is the "command seating". You sit high and can see almost like you're in a pickup, it's great!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth, strong engine. Seating position is great for egress and exiting as well as visibility. AWD is very reassuring in slippery conditions. Interior that is nice and comfy and doesn't feel cheap. Back seat, I am 6' tall and 380 lbs. and I can sit in the back seat with the fronts all the way back!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a 2005 500 AWD which was an excellent car. Bought it used , ex rental, I drove it until 2008 and never put a penny into it except normal services. During that time I got 30mpg on the highway at posted speeds. If you put your foot down the mileage dropped like everything else on the road. Best big car I have had. In 2008 I had promised myself a new 500. When Ford changed the name I pretty well gave up until I tried it out. The car is not much different than the 500 except the trans and engine. Otherwise the Taurus is a 500. I have the sel AWD which handles better than anything else I have including a 2007 F150 4X4. This truck I leave parked during the winter and drive the car. Best car yet</TEXT>

<TEXT>In nearly 11,000 miles, I have found the car to be excellent. With 60 yrs, +900,000 miles, of driving experience in all makes of automobiles, I consider it one of the best cars I have ever purchased. It is comfortable, roomy, quiet, smooth, reliable, safe and peppy. I get >27 mpg hiway, 23.3 overall & I'm not a slow driver. Appearance - very good, finish - superb, both in & out. I'm baffled how your review can be so negative. I disagree with almost every rating, e.g. brakes are not mushy. I find them to be quick & very effective. Same for steering - precise with litle body roll & stable on all road conditions. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has an incredible amount of interior room (front and back seats) and a huge trunk. Ride is very quiet and handling/acceleration is good. Fuel economy is decent for a car of this size; I am averaging 20 city/27 highway. I change my own oil and the placement of the oil filter is very convenient. I've had too many other cars where the filter is hard to reach or it is placed so that oil drips everywhere once removed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a wonderful car! Always liked the look of the 500 (more so the Taurus) and the safety features on this car are second to none. I have the Safety/Security Package, Comfort/Convenience Package, and the Reverse Sensing System. All of which were absolutely worth it. Looking for something to stuff a couple of child seats into and lug around the necessary stuff too. My friends chuckled at me when I got it. That is until I took them for a spin in it and then it was, "Wow!". My wife liked it so much, she went out and got a Taurus X a month later. Fords have come a long, long way and their tag line is spot on. Drive one, indeed. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety, visibility, "Command Seating", gobs of room, smoooooth ride, and super-duper quiet. The engine's got plenty of pep, and shifts smoothly too. Gets an acceptable 24 mpg in mixed driving but it's a big V6 for Pete's sake, not a hybrid!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>While it's a sharp looking car, it's still a Ford. Disappointing highway mileage (26 mpg) is the biggest issue to me. Engine noise is a little to high and the interior quality looked a little cheap, and my cloth seats and plastic trim are already showing signs of wear and I take care of this car! I'm having transmission shift problems (as is another person I know who has one) and the car just developed a coolant leak that the dealer had to put dye in the coolant to find out where it's coming from. It is a sharp looking car though!</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Taurus Owner Indiana</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I purchased a year ago, and 22,000 miles later, this has been one great car. This is a large car, and for the class, the ride and handling are better than expected. It is no barn burner, but acceleration is very good, and the ride is very good. The car is comfortable, quiet and rides well. I almost bought the Avaolon, but I wanted AWD and back up sensors in a large car. The saftey factor and visibility, and the fact that the ride and quietness rival the Avalon won me over. The car has been cheap to own, and trouble free. Coming out of German cars the last 10 years, this is a nice change. I like the bold looks, even with the over the top use of chrome. Mileage on highway is very good, city OK</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hands free communication, AWD, ergonomics, visibility, lots of car for the money, ride, quietness, roominess, no squeeks or rattles typical of other domestic cars, the touch of luxury for the price (wood steering wheel package, analog clock, seat memory/heated, back up sensor, nice wood grain trim)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my 04 Mustang GT in for this car (I needed a back seat) so I know power. The Taurus will accelerate decently if you put your foot down with force--but the mpg really suffers. The Limited series has a quality feel to the interior and the tech system is impressive, especially with the nav and synch. The exterior styling is less impressive, but I was after more space and the car delivers that well. Gas mileage is tricky. I was actually getting better mileage with my GT in town. On the highway I notice that if I drive steady at 70 mph I get about 22.5 mpg; cruising at 65 I get about 24.5; and at 62 (tried today) I get about 26 mpg. Not sure what speed gets 30 mpg--55 maybe?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I indicated in my first review 8 months ago that poor fuel mileage might be a deal killer, although I liked the car very much. My mileage has improved significantly since my first road trip in January. In June my round trip mileage from an identical 2000 mile route improved over 4mpg to almost 31. The difference could be due to winter vs. summer conditions, and break in. My car was new during the first trip. Now I am happy to report that highway fuel economy is excellent. Town mpg's continue to be a little disappointing. Overall, I have found my Taurus to be an excellent road worthy car, expecially for a 6'5" guy like me. </TEXT>

<TEXT>More than enough power. Shifts are incredibly smooth; smoother than the 2008 LE-V6 Camry I drove recently; probably the smoothest transmission I've ever experienced, actually. Engine noise is very muted; most of what you do hear is the exhaust note, which is quiet, but has a nice sound to it, very smooth yet husky. Handling is secure, and the ride is very smooth without being floaty. Brakes respond nicely, without much extra pedal travel. Sync is a pleasure. Seats are broad and supportive, but lack much side bolstering. Makes for easy entry/exit but doesn't hold you tight in corners. The leather is soft and perforated. Stereo sound quality from the more basic 6CD system is great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SYNC, automatic headlamps, keypad entry on door, 263 hp with a true 28 mpg highway (recently took a 300 mile trip and averaged that, and it's not even broken in yet with only 400 miles on it). Dual climate control, </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have used this wonderful sedan for a year. It is quiet, smooth, and very comfortable.I am sure if Ford continues this direction, it will get back to its previous place in the market. I used to have many Japanese cars, and thought never bought an American one. But this Taurus (my first try on American cars) has proved that Ford can make a good car if it wanted to. The Taurus is the kind of car everyone wants: high performance, comfort, affordable price, and save a lot of gas. On my last trip from San Jose to Los Angeles, I have got 30mpg with use of the cruise control.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car replaced a 2002 performance package Crown vVc - and is the only car we liked when shopping for a new car. It drives like a much larger car and feels like a rear wheel drive car. We dislike front wheel drive torque steer common in so many of today's cars. The Taurus has none of that and has great road manners. I know it's not the fastest, or the sportiest, but it represents great a great balance of comfort, performance, utility and economy. To me that is the mark of a great car.

<TEXT>Looking for a car that was safe, comfortable with better than average gas mileage? This is it. This car is the most effortless driving experience I have ever had and I do 30k per year. The ride is quiet, compfortable and a joy for drive and passenger. I was used to driving big cars and never thought I could get used to a vehicle this size. Was I wrong. When I test drove this car I just wanted to keep going. If you are in the market for a car you must consider this one. Mileage is never bad. If you are looking for a superior value in an automobile, you just found it. This is a car that can be driven for a long time and then passed down to kids without them complaining. Drive safe.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My husband wanted large and luxury. I wanted mid sized and fun. I lost out as this car has not one sporty bone. This is a road numbing boat car, remniscent of the Olds 98 my parents drove in the 70's. You can steer it at low speeds with one finger. There is none of that Ford/German stiffness/road feel like in my 01 Taurus, which I still love. But this car doesn't get much less fuel economy than say the Malibu. It has enough bells and whistles to keep me happy, with the Interior Convenience Pkg which has good stuff included. And thankfully, Sync works great and is fun; cause I'm not having much other fun driving this car. It's just too big for my tastes. </TEXT>

Lots of standard features. 263 horsepower. 28mpg. I was going to get the base SEL but eventually decided for the Limited and I'm glad I did. It has a soft ride and handles better with the larger/lower profile tires. Sound system is great, fit and finish is impressive, rides like a dream, dual temp climate control, tons of room in the front and back seats and the truck is huge. Everyone in the family is thrilled with the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've driven Mercedes, Infinity and Hummer for 20 years so I never thought that I would buy a Ford. But, when gas hit 3.50 a gallon, I wanted better mileage. I stopped at a Ford dealership and drove a Taurus. I couldn't believe it. It is as solid as a Benz and it drives like a dream. The second day I owned it, I drove 1100 miles in one day. I just never got tired. What a great car. Ford should be proud. The 6 speed tranny is so smooth. I am more than impressed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My wife thinks the interior look like our Benz. I've gotten 35 MPG on a few tanks. (flat land on interstate) And, the seats are very comfortable. I love this car. We take it on trips and leave our expensive vehicles sitting in the garage. MP3 Plug is very handy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Am extremely satisfied with 2008 FWD Taurus Limited. Car I bought doesn't have all bells/whistles available but is very nicely equipped. Car is comfortable, very roomy, economical, attractive. Fuel economy excellent for car of this size (30 mpg on highway, cruise control at 74 mph, average terrain). The trunk capacity is astounding and with rear seats and passenger front seat folded down, ability to carry large, long items superior to anything on the road of which I am aware. In short, an outstanding automobile & one that Henry would be proud of. Incidentally, the car is in his only color (black) and my favorite [two tone- (black & chrome)] </TEXT>

<TEXT>My last two vehicles have been an Infinity M-45 and a Lexus GS-400. I would rate my Taurus right there with these two vehicles for much less money. I admit I drive my vehicles very hard and my Taurus is up for the task. Highway cruising at 75mph plus is a dream with a smooth comfortable ride and enough power to easily overtake slower vehicles when passing. The handling in city traffic is surprisingly good. I prefer a performance/luxury car and my Taurus fits the bill. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was going to buy a Ford Escape or a Ford Edge, but my son said to try the new Taurus. I bought the Taurus SEL FWD, which is almost 200 lbs lighter than the Limited AWD. The Taurus 3.5L V6 engine with its 263 HP is as fast as my old 2004 Marauder with its V8 and 302 HP, but with 18/28 MPG! Its also just like a baby Lincoln. Probably the best sedan for the money around, considering its roominess, performance, handling, ride quality, quietness, and its build quality. I suffer from partial paralysis in my legs, so I need a car that I can get in&out of more easilty. The new Ford Command Seating allows me easy ingress/egress. I feel like a normal person again when I drive our new Taurus SEL! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought a 08 Ford Taurus last week and can't believe what you get for the money. Since 1998, I had five Cadillac Devilles and two Eldorados. When I drive the Taurus, I don't see much difference between it and the Devilles that I've had. I suppose there may be a little more road noise in the Taurus, but not much. I've been resetting my mileage gauge when I go from city to highway or highway to city driving to see how the mileage looks. So far, it appears that I'm getting about 17 city and 28 highway which is great for a car that is this big, comfortable and safe. I'm quite pleased with this purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>With stability control, this is a very safe, solid car. The build quality and fit and finish appear to be top notch. Based on my impressions, I don't understand why the highways aren't full of 08 Tauruses.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I replaced my 98 Avalon with the 08 Taurus. It is as quiet as the Avalon, has more interior room, and comfortable- -even for a 6'5" guy. Fuel economy is very important to me, and I am very disappointed. A recent drive, Wyoming to Iowa and back netted only 25.5 mpg hand calculated. I would consistently get 30 on the old Avalon doing the same route. It missed the EPA estimate by 2.5 mpg, and I drove conservatively as I typically do. Also, I find the heater, a/c, and fan controls on the lower dashboard are small and difficult to locate and adjust when driving. I would give a strong recommendation for the Taurus, but my disappointing gas mileage might make it a deal killer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've put about 4,000 miles on since October. My first Ford and very impressed with the combination of space and mileage. Very quiet car on the road. We're able to stick 3 car seats in back which is very important for this young family. I've been driving on snow and ice recently and it feels very secure in those conditions. The ergonomics of the car are quite nice. My only complaint is I wish it had a telescoping steering wheel. Lots of soft surfaces inside. The auto climate control has been the surprise feature for me. It works great and the fans are really pretty quiet. You set it to a temperature you like and never have to worry about messing with controls again. Good Job Ford!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wouldn't have thought I'd buy another Taurus. Our kids are gone and we was thinking sports car. Go figure, my wife saw the new Taurus and was in love. The new engine transmission combination is a dream. Interior comfort and style are all a person could ask for. We wanted to get a black exterior but didn't like the way the black stiching showed up on the gray leather. We went with the white exterior with the tan leather. Turns out to be a great combination. We've had the car four months now and couldn't be happier. Havn't taken a long trip yet so can't comment on milage. City MPG seems to be around 18. Only complaint is my wife won't let me drive the car.</TEXT>

We have driven Crown Vic's prior to our last car, so we really had to be pleased. After the test drive, we were convinced this was a great car. After 3 weeks and 1500 miles, we still think this was a great choice. Rides great, handles great and the power is great. Must watch the speed. My combined mileage is 22 to 23 mpg. Highway driving at 65mph in Florida results in 30 to 31 mpg. A great choice for anyone. Were not buying great looks, just a great car with a lot of safety, handling & being towable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The big 4 never came close to the imports until now. Ford has outclassed all of the foreign cars that I've driven. Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, BMW 3 and 4 series, none of them come close to delivering what the Taurus has: Good value, unsurpassed quality, performance, comfort and beauty. I'm surprised to say that I'm a proud owner of a 2008 Ford Taurus. For this past 20 years, I've only driven the Taurus cars when I had to rent them or when I was required to drive one for the Army. I wasn't impressed with it before. I am now. It's the best car that I have ever owned. I can see having this car for this next 5 years or more. Good job Ford. Thanks for the redesign!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this as a replacement for a 2005 500 SE with the CVT transmission. The new engine and transmission is better than the old 3.0/CVT setup for everyday driving and the ride is softer and quieter too. I like the interior better with richer looking woodgrains and improved fit and finish. The exterior is where my disappointment lies. This is where I like the 500 better. The rear end of the 08 Taurus looks plainer than the 500. The 500 also had body side moldings which help protect the sides of the car and broke up the tallness and plainess. Seems like this is happening on many new cars, a way for the manufacturers to cheapen the car and save money perhaps. Also a glovebox light would be nice</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one of the the best cars Ford, or anyone else, ever built. I should know I have bought over 20 new vehicles in my lifetime. It is a cross between a Ford 500 and a Volvo. This car will holds its own with anything built in Europe or Japan. Has the ride of a Lexus, the handling of a small car, and the horsepower of an Audi. The biggest plus is it is huge- as big as a Crown Vic inside- and sill I am getting 27.5 MPG in combined driving. It is like paying for a Ford and being given a Lincoln.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow, what an improvement over the old jellybean style Taurus that lived only at rental car fleets and some taxi fleets! It's beautiful to look at, angular but not like a CTS, rounded but nothing like the old one. It has 'presence' and attracts looks, something other than the 1986 Taurus couldn't do. A VAST improvement over my last Ford, a Mercury Mistake, err, Mystique with the disappearing transmission. Well done Ford!</TEXT>

<TEXT>From the outside, this car doesn't look much bigger than my 2005 Taurus, but specs say its 20" longer. The trunk is massive -able to fit two bikes in there with extra room. Haven't tried to fit it into the garage yet! Kudos for the 6spd transmission. It shift just where it ought to shift and still provides an avg 24mpg on the big 6-cyl motor (Highway I'm showing 28mpg!). Radio sounds nice and is easy to operate. Sunroof is well-designed with pop-up to reduce wind noise. I'm two weeks into this car and am very impressed. Just wish they'd made the "ink blue" color a tish lighter; it seems, from a distance, to be black. Will follow-up at six months.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The new 2008 Ford Taurus is definitely a step up from my previously owned 2005 Ford Five Hundred. From acceleration, to handling, to quietness, the Taurus is much improved over the Five Hundred. The attention to detail in the interior cabin design was greatly enhanced, the seats are still the most comfortable we have found in this class car, and in at least a dozen other ways, great and small, the car is an improvement over the Five Hundred basic concept. The gas mileage is a bit disappointing, but I enjoy the new power and feel of the engine! The '08 Taurus is a winner!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ride, room (cabin and trunk), and a quiet cabin! The 2008 Taurus is large! It has the most back seat room and the largest trunk I have ever seen in a six-cylinder car, no contest! The new Taurus is heavier than the 2007 Five Hundred which gives it a smoother ride, but the Five Hundred was a little more nimble. Take it on the highway where it belongs! 3.5L engine is a significant improvement over the Five Hundred but acceleration has only been upgraded to adequate. Rather quiet cabin, turn on the radio and hear almost nothing outside! Glides over bumps in the road. The high seating position is great, and the (front) seats give good support for your back.
