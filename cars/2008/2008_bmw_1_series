<TEXT>This car is amazing. I have had it for 9 months and love it just as much as the first day I bought it. The build quality is the best I have ever seen in a new car. Acceleration is good in Drive mode and great in Sport Mode. On the highway it is as stable at 75 mph as it was at 25 mph. It is the best car I have ever owned. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Brakes; acceleration; ride; rain sensing windshield wipers. Defroster clears the windshield in a couple of seconds, not sure how they make it do that, but makes me wonder why others haven't copied it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this car to replace a 3 series BMW that saved my life in a crash involving a deer. I traveled to Germany to pick up the car and was able to drive at 120 mph with complete confidence because of the safety features built in to the car. A few weeks ago I was returning home on the freeway around midnight when I saw a wrong-way driver coming right for me in my lane. I had only about two seconds to react, and the Dynamic Stability Control helped me move quickly and safely out of the way. I can't say enough about my confidence in this car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Harmon Kardon stereo, HD Radio, and iPod interface turn the car into a private concert venue, while the driving experience, comfortable seats, warning chimes that harmonize, a quiet cabin, and Dynamic Stability Control all contribute to making this a complete package. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Exceptional performance, fun and reliability. Purchased my 135i convertible in Dec 2008 (good time to buy, great deal, low 0.9 financing). Must say we are a BMW family, and also own a 535i, and previously owned a 330i and Z3 (3.0) so we are biased to the exceptional service, warranty, and purchase experience at BMW. Have put 24K miles on it in 9 months with no problems. Very comfortable for one or two people, excellent seats and ergonomics. Purchased this as a replacement to a 2001 Z3 3.0 with 200K miles, so I view the small back seat as extended cargo space. Smooth, for it's class, on the highway and exceptional on back roads and acceleration. A true wolf in sheep's clothing. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>300hp twin turbo engine and famous BMW handling. Makes it a better daily driver than the M3, for much less. Superior warranty and service at my dealership.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought a NEW 2008 model from the showroom floor. It's loaded with every conceivable option; but I got the car nearly $6,000 off invoice. Still pricey... but definitely worth it! I can't say enough about this little gem! It is the MOST fun I've ever had driving! I wake up every morning and cannot WAIT to drive my car to work! I love the top down fun with my iPod tunes blasting. The iDrive is a little quirky, but once you figure it out, it's fine. The ride is superb, the fit and finish is all BMW... the drive and handling is exactly what you would expect... perfection. Love it, love it, love it... you will NOT be sorry you bought this car! Just do it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Even after 15 months, I still absolutely love this car. It's very unique as you don't see many around, so that's a nice touch. Wasn't even in the market when I bought the car, but had to have it once I drove it. The handling of this car is very smooth and very precise, glides through corners and turns with ease and precision. Lots of power for a car this size. Others are surprised by how fast and quick this little car can be. I don't think of it as a true sports car (although the backseat is basically unusable) because it's got a great ride for a car that is so low to the ground (no sport package) and lots of nice luxury touches as well. Nothing else like it on the road.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Precision handling, smooth transmission (6sp auto), power folding mirrors for tight spaces, ambient/welcoming lighting, hands-free bluetooth, back seats lay forward to expand the trunk, color (metallic sedona red - gets lots of compliments), uniqueness.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Relentless acceleration, great engine sound, and fantastic handling. Regular mode for automatic is like an economy mode in normal driving. Sport mode feels like a manual in that it holds a gear and quickly downshifts. Do not really use paddle shifters very much.There is plenty of room in front and the rear is acceptable if average size. Rear is difficult to access. Top mounted seat position adjusters are very handy for this. Careful driving results in excellent gas mileage. Ride is acceptable, and would be much better without run flats. Great visibility and very nice interior. At first sport seats seemed confining, but now they feel very comfortable. I enjoy each chance I have to drive it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought mine as a leftover 08. Got a great deal. Idrive, Nav, Cold Weather Pack, Sport Susp, Convert, Sport Seats, Active Steer, and whatever else they can add. Owned 3 weeks, rear quarter window switch went out. Replaced w/o a problem. Dealership is excellent! Gas mileage is a little poor. But I can't keep my foot out of it. This is a great little car for fun. Works well as an everyday driver. This car is amazing. Speed, handling are crazy. Do yourself a favor. Drive one and you will be SOLD. And resale is great. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The pure driving force and speed of the car. It handles like it's on rails and then some. Words cannot say enough about how this car's performance and how tame it can be for daily commutes. But when you want to GET IT it's there for you. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I went from a Z4 to the 128i convertible and from manual to automatic transmission so there was an adjustment in expectations. Overall, I have been very happy with the 128. The build quality is outstanding. The handling is exceptional and the motor has plenty of punch, especially in manual shift mode. I love the way the car learns your driving style. The only negative is the standard sound system (not the premium pkg). Speaker placement makes it virtually inaudible with the top down at freeway speeds. The Z4 was better probably because the speakers were directly behind the seat. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>No favorite feature, just a well rounded, well engineered, semi-sport German convertible.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Awesome...just awesome. My wife and I bought our Baby B a year ago for our 20th anniversary. We bought it specifically as a weekend car, hence the low miles. Our car is loaded with every option possible except for heated seats which we don't need in Houston. The car is stupidly fast, handles incredibly well and is built SOLID. I never really noticed a difference in build quality before with my American or Japanese cars...until I bought my first BMW. Tight is the only word that comes to mind. Since the 1 is still somewhat rare I get head turns everywhere I drive her. It really is an amazing car. p.s. We got a stick :p</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The N54 engine. Pure unrestrained love. It pulls from 1k rpm's all the way to 7k nonstop. Handling. She just turns with no body roll or push in the corners. It wants to go fast. Looks. Jet Black, Boston Grey interior. Love it. Seats me <I'm 6'3"> Wife, 14 year old and 7 year old kids just fine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car after being overseas for 2 years. I wanted a car that was fast and fun, but I didn't want the 'boy racer' look that the Evo conveys. After two days of shopping looking at both American and foreign cars, I choose the 135, and I was not disappointed. It is small so you have all the maneuverability that you want, yet big enough that I was able to move from Jersey to DC with it. I have gotten many compliments from people on the car, as they are still relatively new. I got the Sedona Red Metallica color, and it looks awesome. Also I wanted a true sports car so I got a manual and the clutch is extremely smooth. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>At 6?4?, the main thing I like about this car is that I fit in it. I was unable to fit in the 370Z, Altima Couple, Mustang GT, and Camaro. The only car with equal driver room was the A5.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I took delivery of the car just prior to the summer and got to enjoy the full on summer experience but wanted to live with it through a winter before writing a review. The verdict: invest in good set of snow tires and the car is almost as much fun in the winter as in the summer. The DSC system is totally effective at keeping things under control on snow packed roads. Switch it off and it's donut time. All year round the power is enticing - smooth and unrelenting -if you keep your foot in it you will be in road-side vehicle seizure territory in a blink. Yes, the cabin is a bit tight and you wish for a few more cubbies and a bigger glovebox but the overall experience is worth it. Practical fun.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the heated seats, blue-tooth and I-Pod interface and overall ergonomics of the interior. The car fits like a glove. Surprisingly the trunk is actually useful - even with the top down. The active headlights are useful as well. This is not just a gimmick. The remote key/start system is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I sold my Audi A4 3.2 to my son and drove to Roadshow BMW, Memphis, TN to look at a Mini Cooper S. Drove out with a BMW 135i! They were great to deal with. I test drove one in Little Rock last summer and didn't realize how fast it is. I now understand what BMW mean by Ultimate Driving Machine! The A4 is a great car but the 135i is even better. The car is much quicker, the handling is better, road feel is better and it's quieter.</TEXT>

<TEXT>All around solid, stays on road. Engine has a "low throaty" sound that sets off other car alarms - too cool! Small size is very convenient, fun and adds to the great acceleration. Quiet interior with top up, car suspension handles train track crossings and bumps with ease. In rain, excellent perf both from a handling, sound & water management. I have to admit, it is expensive and very unpractical, BUT it is a kick in the pants to drive and makes my commute fun! To hell with the economy and my crappy 401K perf - let's go for a drive! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>When sun hits dash board, red lighting becomes blue - quick top up/down, night time ambient lighting, satellite radio, folds/channels in rag top that prevent drip from coming across passenger window, easy gas cap, pressure sensors in tires - an owner's manual that actually thinks I will baby it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>6 months and zero issues at all (never had this experience with prev. german cars purchased). Everything works well, surprised at how well it drives in snow (took it to Killington VT). If you drive carefully, easy to get 30/31 mpg on the highway (auto trans), but the moment you put some gusto in your driving and you hit 22 mpg very fast.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great front seats, and very good trunk capacity with seats down (put in the back Queen bed head and foot boards + 40inch TV -- all with boxes. Very smooth auto trans, and great handling (I do not have sport package, but for me it suffices).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Been looking forward to getting my 135 and it's finally here. What a great car; amazing engine of course and with better brakes than the new M3. Drove my brothers 09 M3 and this car felt almost as quick. I say felt because now I added the computer upgrade from Vishnu that brings my 135 to 400hp!! This car is now a monster! Of course the materials used in this car are not quite as nice but, for the money you can't go wrong. </TEXT>

Handling and corning are smooth. Overall of this vehicle is fun to drive with, but too expensive to own it. MBenz C300 sport is worth of buying, they're nearly the same price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car looks great from a distance but open the trunk and wham, primer everywhere, that paint should be like on the outside! Guess that's why the rust protection is what 4 years! Then they put those cheesy plastic plugs through the carpet on the trunk lid to affix it to the metal and put holes in the metal to do it - cheap. I open the hood and there is a long line of open unfinished jagged steel down the inside of each side of the hood. Talk about cheap! Everywhere I look I see corners like that cut.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I actually live in Germany and have the hatchback 118d version of the 1 series which I don't think is available in the US yet. It has been a superb choice, extremely fuel efficient in a country where gas has been even more expensive, an absolute blast to scoot around town in but with an interior comfortable enough for a ong trip. The business stereo package is incredible also. I am leasing now and will likely buy when I can.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you love driving this is the car you need to get. Fast, no turbo lag, unbelievable road feel when cornering, great brakes. The controls are intuitive, bluetooth works fine. Test drove an automatic however bought a manual (even without trying it) which I think is far superior. If you live in a cold climate and you are getting the Sports package have in mind that you'll need winter tire/wheel combo - around $2500, this is if you go for the only BMW approved winter tire option. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my 128. It is great fun to drive. It has more than enough power for a casual driver such as me. With its 6-speed transmission, it generally gets around 24-26 mpg in the city. I have always liked the looks of BMW. Now I get the look at a fairly decent price. The 128 is a luxury car without many frills. The interior has been pared of luxury to make space for roominess. Well for the people in front, anyway. It's still pretty much a 2-seater. Oddly, for a BMW, the interior is without many standards items I have grown used to over the years. Example: The 128 is curiously without a functional cupholder. The only working cupholder is directly behind the shifter. I still love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the BMW the way it suppose to be! I have been in Germany since 2006 and I drove tons of different vehicles on the autobahn, but this baby is a rocket!!! Took it to 220-230 km/h on the autobahn and it was solid planted on the road. I have the Sport Package with the Z-rated tires and that helps a lot. Love the sound of the engine, great rev crescendo, no turbo lag, corners amazing on European twisted roads! Overall, a better "driver car" oriented vehicle compared to the 3 series which seems heavy after driving the 1 series.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a lovely and potent little coupe. A true driver's car, taut, precise, nimble and all those other accolades one can conjure for a superlative German performance car. The car corners like it was on rails with no discernible body roll. Absolutely NO turbo lag anywhere on the power curve which is nothing short of a miracle. I have found nothing to dislike about this car whatsoever after 1700 miles. Of course the mileage is mediocre at best (16.5 city, 22-25 highway) but I knew that going in. Fit and finish are superb and the cockpit is both comfy & functional as a true Germanic driving machine should be. Instruments are well placed and easy to use. No iDrive = no complaints. A superb car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Zero turbo lag, power on tap from the bottom to the top of the RPM spectrum. Great clutch, very responsive brakes and the perfect sport suspension for this rocket. I find the body very appealing although I understand others may not. Never liked red, but the sedona red is very subtle and attractive.</FAVORITE>

Recently, I had something in one of my tires and the lights came on to alert me. I took it in to BMW service dept. and sure enough I had a nail in the tire. Not cheap tires to replace though! I have the sport package and it has run-flat tires on it. Where ever I go, I get people coming up and asking me about this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got done driving 4000 miles across country. All I can say is that I'm very disappointed. Engine is fantastic, and the suspension is good, if not a touch soft. Fuel economy is decent, and pretty much what I expected. The seats are pretty comfortable and supportive on long trips, though not the best I've been in. What I didn't expect is the car surrounding this great motor to be such a piece of junk. It rattles over every pebble, the passenger side window no longer works, and the "premium" speakers are defective and emit nothing but static when playing high notes. Overall, not worth $40,000. And the last BMW I ever buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned a 135i for 4 months now. It's fun to drive, but suffers from multiple problems/issues: Throttle response is poor for a car advertised as having no turbo lag. My wife drives a Saab 9.5 which has a better throttle response, especially at low RPM. Dealer tells me performance is 'within spec'. I can't see the radio with polarized glasses on. Radio seems to shut down intermittently, usually right after power-up. Dealer diagnosed a faulty fuel pump, and I'm on a waiting list for a replacement. Apparently they're on backorder??? Run-flat tires are a disappointment. Overall, the car handles and accelerates well, but is a disappointment compared to the E36 M3 I drove before the 135</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's fun to drive and has a good amount of power for the size of the car. Overall it's a decent car. A few initial complaints would be the passenger seat is a little uncomfortable when the cupholder is installed (although it is removable), the standard stereo is mediocre (speakers rattle at times and changing stations is not intuitive), the second cupholder can only be used when the armrest is in the up position (unless you use it for a really short cup), and the iDrive needs improvement. If these complaints seem trivial, it's because they are. Overall the car is a great little car that most people would enjoy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have never driven a car as much fun as this one is to drive. I may even take my wife to a driving school so she can enjoy it. I didn't like the look of the car when I ordered it but I bought it after one test drive around the block.{the demo car} Now I like the looks but that had nothing to do with the purchase. It is that much fun to drive. I average 22 miles per gallon but you can get 27 if you want to drive that way. I don't. On the highway 28 is easy. I wanted a sports car but with a little more room. This car is by itself when you factor in room and handling. It wasn't cheap but the best never is.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Everything in this car is in harmony from the shifter that snicks into gear to the razor sharp precision of the steering wheel to the sport seats with adjustable bolsters that hold you in place. If you exercise restraint when ordering (and don't mind the wait) this car is actually a bargain. I got an 08' 135i AW w/6sp and sport package. Everything from Xenon adaptive lighting to rain sensing wipers are standard. It comes with a lot of feature content for the money. The ride is stiff but well damped, it is amazing how well BMW pulls this off. Everything in a BMW revolves around the engine and what an engine it is. There is power in every gear at every RPM.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove it on the Autobahn and it is the bomb! Really fast. There is a slight lag in the throttle response during highway (Autobahn) overtaking, but I can live with that. Probably from the turbos. Using the sequential manual transmission is a blast. However, the gas mileage is really poor in that mode. I drove a total of 29 miles all in the SMT mode and used a quarter of a tank. Assuming a full tank is 16 gallons, I used 4-gallons, or about 7-miles to the gallon. Too bad. If you really like sporty driving then get a manual transmission. That said from a performance perspective, it is almost a perfect car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A very fun car with great power when the new software doesn't make the turbos lag. Not as much low end torque as the first 135i I test drove in March 08. Now needing a fuel pump makes me wish I bought an Acura or Infiniti. Lots of fun when it's not in the shop. Run flat tires ride like bricks. The suspension is a little soft. I wish the cruise control was on the steering wheel. Getting into 2nd gear is slow and temperamental. Can't read the radio with sunglasses on. Headlights look like a crazy cat. Overall it's a blast to drive, but the magazines must have tested one without the new 29.2 software that causes turbo lag. Would I buy it again? Not sure???</TEXT>

<TEXT>I considered the 3series convertible before purchasing my Mini Cooper S convertible in 2005. I loved driving it in town but it was stiff riding and uncomfortable on the highway. One day, one of my students brought in a 1 series brochure. I loved the car from the minute I saw it. Immediately I scheduled a test drive and ordered the car in April. After returning from Germany on June 20th, my BMW was waiting for me. I own the car for 9 days now. The car really drives well and I just love it. It performs well and is smooth riding on the highway. My husband liked the Mini Cooper S conv. a lot but after driving/riding the BMW conv. he changed his mind. I'm/we are sold on the new 1 series.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Premium Package, Cold Weather Package, Xenon Headlights, Park Distance Control I like the fact that you can put the top up and down while driving. I also like the look of the 1 series when the top is down. Bluetooth and MP3 Player integration are very nice as well. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is both comfortable and very fun to drive. Being six feet tall, I thought the back seat would be a little tight for me, however when I have sat in the back it is more than enough room and also very comfortable. The materials and interior design are very excellently crafted, as well as the beautiful exterior. Automatic roof works great and car is amazing with the top down. The engine sounds powerful and exhilarating, and yet the ride is very quiet. The premium Hi-Fi sound system sounds great with the top up or down. iPhone compatibility is great and sounds great on both sides of the phone, even with the top down and strong winds.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After test driving this little beast for almost an hour I got back in my 04 G35 Coupe 6M, that I had loved for 4 years till that moment. My G felt big, bulky and slow by comparison. I had also driven the new G37 which is a big improvement over the older model, but it just could not compare to the nimble, precise pocket rocket that is the 135i. The car handles like it's on rails and yet is so comfortable. If you don't need a big car this little gem is pretty much perfect. Actually, the trunk in the 135i is much bigger than the older or new G. Bottom line, this is the best car I have ever driven or owned and I still can't get the silly grin off my face when I get out of it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>That sweet twin turbo with effortless power and no lag, amazing brakes, sport seats are the most comfortable I've ever found, iPod integration, handles like a dream.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a Z4 previously and loved it, but overall I like the 1er better. Meets or exceeds every one of my expectation. The 128i is plenty fast and is more practical than the 135i. The 135i is almost stupid fast and very few drivers will be able to get more than 30% out of what the car is capable of.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fav features are the step tranny, the windblocker, the sweet engine, the extra driver/passenger legroom, the overall small exterior dimensions.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am 6'2" and I am very comfortable in the car. I have been in it for several hours at a time and never felt the urge to have to shift my weight in the seat. I was initialy concerned about my leg resting against the firewall and it becoming uncomfortable but its actually quite nice. The stock stereo is very nice and the iPod connection is effortless. The shifting is incredibly easy, the clutch is quite predictable and the power is relentless. I can be going 80 mph on the highway and floor it and the car just takes off. The footwell is a little cramped and I don't suggest driving with sandals on. Cornering is incredible as well and if your going too fast the DSC kicks in just when it should. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine power, interior comfort, exterior design, stereo w/ iPod, looks from other drivers. The car is very tight too, not a single rattle of any kind. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my Z4 for the 128. I like the comfort of the interior and the addtional room of this car. It is responsive and the braking is excellent. The 128 doesn't deliver the same level of power as the 135, but I drive in heavy traffic and the six cyl. is more than adequate. I really love this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I test drove many new convertibles and decided to purchase the 128i convertible. I'm 6'2" and discovered I don't fit comfortably in most 2-seaters out there. We are very happy with our car and would highly recommend it for many reasons. The car handles like no other car I've ever driven, probably due to the sports package. It is very comfortable with the leather power seats and we were actually able to fit our two teenaged sons in the back, a bit snug but do able. Acceleration is very smooth and the 6- speed automatic transmission shifts just right, in fully auto or manual modes. We also like the zero-maintenance cost feature that covers everything except tires for 4 yrs</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Like the looks of the car with the top up or down. Lots of fun to drive down country roads with the top down, ya hoo!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just finished an 800 mile roadtrip across NM and CO. What a treat! I bought it as a roadtrip car to keep forever, so no turbos or nav/iDrive. I have an automatic with premium and cold weather pkg. The car was comfortable and smooth. The unexpected highlights were a roof that had amazing sound dampening, plenty of engine power even at 10000+ feet and a final gas mileage of 32.2mpg across central Colorado (avg speed 54.5mph). The car was FANTASTIC, everything I hoped for and more when I decided to buy it. I researched many other vehicles from an Eos to a MB CLK350 before getting this. As a first year model I thought it might be valuable one day, too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort (ride and seats), gas mileage, softop operation and sound qualities. Excellent visibility top up or down. First year model but the engine and components have been around for several years on other beemers. Best of both worlds if you ask me.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wonderful design, with a lot of power. The seats are uncomfortable, and the ride is rough over NYC streets. It is not built for long rides. The windows rattle & the radio is not good. I think that the engine is too powerful for the size of the car. I find that driver must fight to harness the power, only very experienced drivers should drive the car. The car makes interior noises as it rides over rough roads. The car burns gas (22 hwy & 16 city) & it burns oil. I have had to bring the car into BMW service three times to have oil added in the first 7K miles. I test drove the BMW 328i coupe & I should have paid the difference for a better car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just received my 135. It's the best car I've driven. I drove a wide range of cars ranging at all different price points up to over $100k. For $40k though, you can have one great performance car. I'd say the sports package is a must have. The iDrive takes some practice to get used to. The brakes are just amazing on the 1! 60 to 0 length is on par with far more exotic cars. Oh and one more thing, I think this car looks WAY better in person compared to photos. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It's only a few hundred pounds lighter than the 3-series, but it feels a lot more light and nimble when you drive it. Both manual/auto transmissions are great: the shifting action of the manual is precise and confident; the clutch is predictable and easy to engage. There isn't much sacrifice at all in ride comfort because of its relatively tight dimension and suspension tuning. It truly is a great fun little car to toss around. It's certainly not as edgy or raw as the M3 (E46 or E92), but feels as quick and manuvable if not more (especially when compared to the new portlier E92 M3), and it has better gas mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very addictive, smooth yet powerful linear lag-free twin turbo engine. Great transmission and clutch feels. World class suspension/chassis that blend in high performance and day-to- day comfort just so perfectly. Nice BMW-typical luxurious interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just traded in an '03 911 for the 135i--wow, for about half the MSRP, I think I got twice the car. This is my first sports car without a stick shift. Love the beefy aluminum paddle shifters. Car absolutely flies. Inside is very quiet, except for the growl from the 300 hp engine. My Porsche was loud and uncomfortable and the 135 is so comfortable. I got the sport package and the seats are amazing. The thigh support is great for long trips. Car is an A+ and really does rival a 911 for performance but exceeds it for comfort and practicality with real back seat and room for two or three sets of golf clubs in trunk. I've owned a 911, Boxster S and a TT Coupe. The 135i blows them all away. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth for phone. Performance. Brilliant and effortless acceleration. Steptronic transmission with two automatic and one paddle shift option. Interior comfort and look. Reasonable cost. Real back seat and good trunk space. Push button ignition.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 135 is the perfect size for me. The power is awesome. Was concerned about the iDrive but learning curve is quick. Inside storage is pitiful. No place for even your glasses case. One usable cup holder. Red LED ambient lighting, without turning the dash intensity up to practically full, is not visible. Should have been blue. Premium sound system/HD radio is supurb. Blue tooth and conviencence access great. 6 speed shifts like butter. Cool feature is the brakes hold on a hill for a couple seconds so you don't roll backwards. Paint, fit and finish top notch. One gripe... Offer 18 inch, performance, NON RUN-FLAT tires w/spare. Run-flats are problematic, expensive and wear out quickly.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, Blue-tooth, premium radio, handling, engine sound and front seat comfort. This is my first experience with the adaptive headlights. They work so well I will probably always order these on future cars if available. They are unbelievable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I never thought I would fall in love with the entry level baby bimmer!! This car is quite capable of being considered an entry level M car. It's got more than plenty of power, agility, speed, and superior performance handling. If you want a nicely priced bang for you dollar this is it. It's a definitely in the "gotta have" car list. Although back seat is a bit cramped, but what do you expect on a "premium compact" coupe? Gas is not too bad at 26 highway. Great everyday car and always fun to drive. You have to test drive it and really drive it both normal and hard to appreciate it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turbo charged engine, paddle shifters, navigation, handling, sexy muscular look, and well balanced. Sound system is great for not upgrading to the premium sound price. Minimal options is best!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Took delivery of my jet black 135i coupe the day they went on sale in the US. Truly a great car, both in terms of performance and styling. I chose the automatic with the paddle shifters since I use the car for urban commuting. It's hands-down the best automatic I've driven - just put it in Sport mode and the car moves like a rocket. It costs the same as a 328 coupe while delivering performance that is several notches above. While there's no other car that exactly compares, of all the other cars I drove the Cayman S feels the most similar - and at $20k more, it makes my $44k loaded 135 seem like an even greater bargain.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>An exhaust note that should make every 3 Series driver jealous. High-quality materials and standard features (xenons with corona ring DRLs, for example) that are on par with other bimmers. Blistering twin-turbo performance that makes an M3 or Cayman S hard to justify.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Not only the best looking BMW, all the legendary handling and driving dynamics are there. The interior has adequate room for four although the rear seating can be somewhat lacking for large adults. Wonderful safety features such as door anchors and BMW assist give you a break on insurance rates. This car feels absolutely rock solid! No creaking sounds, no rattles, as if its made of a single piece of metal. It's cute on the outside and plush on the inside. Get the premium package... worth it with beautiful leather/electric seats, cool compass mirror, and bluetooth. This car may outsell the 3-series someday!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a car that was fun to drive and the 135 fits the bill. The six-speed manual is a welcome change of pace from the ordinary and makes the twin-turbo a pocket-rocket. The sports suspension is firm but still very comfortable and the handling is superb. I'm 6'4" and there is plenty of room for me to change gears and maneuver. The profile of the car is spectacular and has already gotten a number of positive comments. If you are looking to get into a Bimmer that is all about fun, this is the car for you.</TEXT>
