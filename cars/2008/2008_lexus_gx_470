<TEXT>I purchased a used 2008 Lexus GX470 2 weeks ago with just 7500 miles. I love this car! I previously drove an Acura MDX and this vehicle is so much more comfortable. The ride is smooth and there is no road noise at all. My only issue: my Blue tooth. I can hear perfectly but no one seems to hear me! Hopefully, this can be fixed. If you enjoy an SUV but yearn for the smooth ride of a luxury sedan, consider this model! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Of all the vehicles I have owned, this must be the best one suited for the whole family. Used to drive an Infiniti Q45 that was an excellent vehicle but not enough room, my wife drives a Honda Pilot, which I dread to drive because of intolerable road noise. The GX470 is the end result of my hours of research and test drives. It is like driving in the quiet comfort and luxury of my previous Q45, with the roominess of the Honda Pilot.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation, ride and comfort, high quality interior materials. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I picked up my GX in 3/08. I wanted to wait awhile before posting a review to allow for some perspective. The craftsmanship and build quality is fantastic. Power train the smoothest I've experienced (previous BMW owner). The car has been 100% trouble free so far (14K miles). No squeaks or rattles to speak of. Superb driving position and seats. Having just moved into a new house with a new baby, this car has been very useful for carrying boxes, etc. Rock solid in snow as well. Wish gas mileage was better though; I've been averaging 17.5 mpg on premium. I would recommend this car as long as you don't mind the mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V8 engine, seats, cargo space, quiet interior, Bluetooth, overall feeling of quality</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was the first one here to write a review (see bottom). It has been a year and a month and a happy 14,000 miles since I got my 2008 GX470. What can I say, I STILL LOVE IT. I feel like 100 bucks when I get in and I know I made the right choice when I get out. Every day I look forward to driving the car. I use it primarily for commuting to my workplace (40 miles both ways). When I get home it feels nice to know that this great vehicle is waiting for me in the morning. I had 2 problems: driver side mirror was sticking and my aluminum wheels had some black spots. Both problems were fixed promptly and the dealer even apologized for the inconvenience. I will drive this truck forever!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Space inside, while small overall. Distinct look.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I can't say enough great things about this truck! It's a phenomenal piece of machinery and if you love the 4runner, the GX 470 will put it to shame and make you wonder why you ever drove one! The ride is smooth. The interior is plush and luxurious. It rides so quiet! As many have said already, there are a few things that need improving but that's the advantage when you own one. You know it will only be a few years before they roll out the next new model. I just couldn't be happier. I traded my RX350 in for this and I think I made an excellent choice. Much roomier, not too much difference on the gas mileage and it's just a more solid vehicle. Truly outstanding product!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heats up in a snap! Keyless start is a great option. Navigation is top notch with vibrant color screen and easy to use buttons. Seats are angled high so you're looking down towards the road, unlike the 4runner. Big side windows. Ultra smooth ride!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was driving a 2006 Acura MDX. I then decided to take a look at Lexus. Well, so far the GX470 drive like a GEM. The ride is very smooth and I really couldn't be happier. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is very nice, navigator/Mark Levinson stereo. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Lexus and I love it. I traded in my BMW 530 because I now have 5 grandchildren and I needed more room. I looked at the Volvo X90 and the 3rd row seat was not very accessible, Sequoia and Tahoe are too big. This LX 470 is just right. The third row seats are very easy to fold up and down. The ride is very smooth and luxurious. The bluetooth and navigation system are easy to use. I am very happy I bought this car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Folding third row seats, Bluetooth and navigation.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This was the first Lexus we have purchased and traded in an 05 MDX. We have had the car since December of 2007 and have put 10,000 miles on. The ride is superb and the acceleration and handling are just right for a vehicle this size. This is the first car my wife ever said that she liked. We considered the RX, but it was smaller than the MDX we traded, so we went with the GX for the extra space. The build quality is superb and every angle you look exemplifies luxury. The handling in the snow is superb and you feel safe at all times. Was very impressed how well the vehicle handled considering its height. If you're thinking about the GX, its well worth it and you won't be disappointed. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation and Bluetooth. Luxurious interior with the highest quality materials. Sporty yet luxurious look of the exterior. Graphite alloy wheels - they help hide dirt and brake dust. Adjustible suspension and height control.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought this car in November before Thanksgiving and I wish we would not have. We compared it between the Tahoe and Escalade and decided to go with the Lexus because of the resale value. What I really hate this car because of the lack of trunk space with the third row folded up and the big bulky 4wd shifter. Most manufactures have put 4wd at the touch of a button and lexus desided to leave it as a shifter to take up half of center console. Because of the positioning of the shifter and 4wd shifter you have to reach around to control the heated seat controls which gets old real quick. The transmision is all so a joke because it has shifted into a higher gear as soon as i begin to lay into it</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The plush leather seats and that is about it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded my 2001 4Runner for a 2008 Lexus GX. What a great upgrade from the Toyota model to their luxury brand. This vehicle rides amazingly smooth. It is a little thirsty on the tank, but hope this improves over time. The seats are extremely comfortable and all the features in it are just wonderful to use. We love the looks we get riding around town in this. You see why Lexus is at the top of their game.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the sound system and the ride on it is so smooth. We drove it from Kansas City on a 4 hour trip back to our home and the ride is phenomenal. The XM integration works wonderfully. Like the auto windshield wipers, too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought an 08 GX 470 for my wife and love every bit of this truck. I own an 06 Trailblazer SS and love it to death. I can say the Lexus out performs the SS in every category except performance. The Lexus is tight The doors don't rattle when you shut them. At the age of 33 I'm really sick of all the American cars I've had. I guess I'm getting old and tired of dealing with the problems. GX 470 is awesome.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav is nice, good power, great quality for the price. Perfect ride for being 4wd capable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 5th Lexus, had two ES 300 sedans, and this is my third GX 470. We love the luxury ride, the look, the amenities, the comfort, and the regular mountain driving is superb. I trade every two years, and don't think I would ever consider another car as nothing I have seen matches the quality and the Lexus service.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Colors available are fantastic. Leather is real quality, navigation and sound system are incomparable, and the Lexus Link is a really special extra.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought our GX on 12/24/07. We looked at the Sequoia and the Yukon. I drove all three. The GX blows the other two away in driving luxury. We were selling our 12 yr old Jeep Grand Cherokee and needed something bigger. The Lexus is a great SUV for both road trips and everyday driving. 3 days after buying it we put drove it to the UP Michigan for a ski vaca. Drove great in the snow and the long distance. Third row is easy to remove for extra storage. I thought I'd hate the way the hatch opens in the rear, but I am liking how easy it is to get things in and out. My only complaint is I wish the side mirrors folded in mechanically and the third row folded flat, that's it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Reclining 2nd row for kids to sleep. Turning radius is great. Head room. Favorite feature is the change suspension option. Navigation system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just picked up my new car last night. Already put 200 miles and loving it. If you want speed, performance and fuel economy, get something else. If you want plush luxury ride with great ergonomics this is it. I had 2000 LX 470 which was a little too big for me. My wife has a 2007 RX 350 - a little too small for me and too many chicks riding in that. But when I got into GX, I knew right away, its a match made in heaven.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hight position, nav with camera, Mark Levinson sound, iPod hook in and bluetooth.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving a Durango for many years, we wanted something a little nicer but still powerful enough to keep up our active outdoor lifestyle. We were looking at the Sequioa, but decided that for a little more the GX had all that we wanted and more. This is a great deal. The vehicle performed on a recent road trip under conditions ranging from 110 degrees to below 32 without any issues. It handled on ice, snow, mud, dirt, rock and pavement better than expected. Performance is unbelieveable when you accelerate. It tows like a truck and the engine doesn't even balk. Sometimes it is easy to forget that you aren't driving a luxury sedan. The only close competition is the Mercedes GL class. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The nav is top-of-the-line. Integrated Bluetooth works flawlessly with the RAZR. The leather is the highest quality we have encountered. Reclining rear seats are a plus. Seats 8, bring some friends along! Adjustable suspension (the sport mode is great on the highway - 4x4 does wonders off road).</FAVORITE>
