<TEXT>This is my favorite vehicle to drive. I'm not sure what is different about my Pilot, but I've got plenty of acceleration on demand. So much so, I've caught myself by surprise and squealed the tires while leaving a parking lot. I've never owned a new car before but I came into this expecting Honda reliability and my Pilot has kept up its end of the bargain. The only parts that have needed replacement or adjustment were minor and the dealer replaced them quickly and under warranty. Fuel economy is better than the EPA estimate with 24 average MPG on the interstate, city mileage is worse at 14 average MPG but I live in a city with quite a few hills. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The automatic air conditioning controls. I set it for 68 degrees and it makes it happen. I love it! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Driving in the Canadian winter is not fun, yet the Pilot, even at -45 degrees C runs fine. The traction assist will catch you unaware on ice corners and might cause you to over-correct. The get-up-and-go on ice is fantastic! Cold starts without plugging in are no problem, and the engine warms up very quickly. Feild of view for a tall person is limited by the side pillars I find myself leaning forward and back with a lot of head movement while checking intersections.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The variability of the cargo space. This vehicle has great pickup.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We got the outgoing 2008 Pilot EX-L at a great deal as the 2009's were coming in later that month. We are glad we went with the Pilot as this is my 4th Honda product. Chose the mocha metallic with saddle leather seats. The lighter color gave it the sense of more room and upscale over the gray available in the darker models. Lots of room for the baby's carseat and easy hook up to the latches. Tons of room in cargo area with 3rd row folded. Stroller and groceries fit with room to spare. Engine is very smooth and eases with on ramps and passing. The interior is a little dated, but after 5 years of this model, Honda has worked out all the bugs by now</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seat warmers, conversation mirror, tons of storage, center console, XM radio high view of road, overall fit and finish, great visibility throughout.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We traded in my 2001 Honda Civic for the Pilot. Like other reviewers, we looked at the MDX, Highlander etc. This was my favorite by far. I love the look of this truck vs a cross over. I feel like I have a presence on the road and I love looking at the car. The interior could be a little more fashionable It is pretty simple but it has plenty of storage space and room for all passengers. We recently had 6 adults in the car for an hour and everyone was comfortable. Comfortable, fun to drive, great leather and XM. Who wouldn't love this vehicle? I see a lot of complaining about the gas mileage. I am getting about 17- 18 mpg in city and 20 mpg if I am on the freeway. Pretty good!</TEXT>

<TEXT>August 27th, 2008, I took my 2001 4Runner Limited to trade for 2008 Pilot AWD w/entertainment. I need more than five seats and like Pilot appealing. I have a big disappointment, ROAD NOISE! Here is my two cents for potential buyer, test drives on freeway, drive on a road with speed 40 mph or more and try to open back windows. It could break your EARDRUM. I learned how to overcome the road noise by turning on radio as loud as I can take every time I get on freeway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I loved my Pilot the whole time I had it. Recently I was involved in a accident where I rear ended a sedan and another SUV rear ended me. myself and the other 5 passengers were all safe, but my airbags failed to deploy; none of them. My radiator was busted, but still no airbags. I filed a complaint with Honda, but have not received a response. The NHTSA is also looking in to the matter. My insurance company told me that I hit above the airbag sensors. I'm no expert on sensors, but rear ended a sedan! My radiator was busted! The only thing I want to know is where were my airbags when I needed them?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned SUVs from Expeditions to Escapes and this was my third Honda purchase (never disappointed with Hondas). I love this SUV. The exterior is nice, nothing too special but as a family man I don't really care. What matters to me is a great vehicle for me and the family. We have two kids and the problem was taking along their friends. This vehicle is large enough for the family with friends and their stuff. I also drive this daily to work through narrow city streets. It's a pleasure to drive. Good acceleration, great handling and fun to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased our Pilot in May of this year, while we like the ride, although the road noise is pretty bad, we feel safe in it and it is comfortable. However do not expect to come close to the EPA estimates on the window sticker, the last tank of gas was primarily in town driving, we got 10 mpg, the best we have gotten on the road was 18 mpg. We have 6000 miles on it and we are looking for something else in and SUV that will come closer to the EPA est. Our 36 foot motor home gets 8 mpg, so go figure.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 2005 Civic in for this, but there was just never enough room. My DH is over 6' and the 2 kids are growing fast. I miss filling up for $35, but we took a 2 hour drive to shopping mall with 8 adults, and we were perfectly comfortable. We are leaving tomorrow for vacation, and have plenty of room to bring everything we could want, and we will be comfortable enough to take the scenic route. The DVD player is our first in-car system, and I am glad I finally gave in. We didn't get the NAV, because he prefers the Garmin after market.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the regular house plug in the console, its a God-send!! Plenty of room, power and space, without being lost in the crowd of Suburbans and Tahoes. A little more ground clearance for local flooding issues than our old minivan.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>CR-V's gas mileage and handling is much better. However, the year-end discounted price was almost the same as CR-V, and one big car in the house wouldn't hurt. Didn't like the look of 2009 Pilot. It's a set of best compromises that we settled on.</TEXT>

I have 1 broken bone, fortunate to be alive. The police and hospital both said how lucky I am. You only get 1 chance in an accident, so choose the safest vehicle on the market.

<TEXT>This is now our third Honda and definitely the nicest.The Pilot has amazing interior space, is incredibly comfortable and, like all Hondas, the engineering is superb. I would have liked to have the option to get both the Navigation and rear entertainment systems together-something Honda really ought to consider. Additionally, the steering wheel controls are inadequate. Unlike my Civic, which you can go up or down on the radio stations, you have to cycle all the way through 6,1, 2,3,4 to get to preset 5. Stupid. I would also like a cooling option on the leather seats. Even with climate control, in a hot climate the leather doesn't breath and gets hot.</TEXT>

I also like the integration of the radio, navi, CD, back-up camera. The wife loves having a commanding view of the road. Some minor issues, wheel noise for one, which seems to ba a common complaint. Also, no MP3/Ipod hook-up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had shopped around for an SUV for six months. First, I looked at the 2008 Toyota Highlander and test drive it. Second, I checked out the 2008 Honda Pilot and test drive it. I was very pleased with the Value Package and the way the 2008 Honda Pilot handles the road. It is very smooth and quiet ride. I have always owned an Ford vehicle. My last vehicle was an 1998 Ford Explorer. There were several recalls with the tires, etc. However,I love my Ford. I am happy with my 2008 Pilot. I would recommend an Honda Pilot. It is an great SUV for your money. It holds value, and cost less on repairs. I wish it would offer 100,000 miles on extended warranty. Try it and you will love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We received our Pilot LX 2WD May 30 after returning our Mazda MPV. I have to say not having a minivan is nice. I don't think we sacrificed anything except indoor parking. The width of the Pilot is about 6 inches wider than our old van was but is a much finer vehicle. Still good for carpool but has the added power needed to accelerate and overtake. On the whole, with all incentives, this was a great purchase. I think it looks nicer than the new 2009.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my second Honda Pilot in March 2008 after being the happy owner of a 2005 Pilot. The vehicle is perfect for a large family as it seats 8 comfortably (kids in th rear). There is one flaw and it is identical to that in the 2005 model. When driving at speeds greater than 40 miles per hour, try opening the rear passenger windows ONLY! Start with the back right and you will notice a very loud hum or vibration. It is NOT a minor noise as it is almost deafening and pounds on your ears. I am not sure if Honda is aware of this problem. I thought it was just my own '05 model that was doing this however it is identical in the '08. The pilot otherwise is perfect! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats are easy to fold down. Plenty of leg room in the 2nd row and decent space in the third row for children. It takes regular gas - big $ saver and gets decent mileage for a full size SUV. Attractive styling, easy handling and comfortable for long trips. Factory DVD is a lifesaver.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and our two kids stepped up from a 4cyl 07' accord to the 08' Pilot expecting more kids soon. So the space was perfect. We got out of our lease with 1 1/2 years left on the lease and still got a really great price! The Honda Staff was very accommodating as with our first lease. The truck has great handling for a seasoned driver. And the power is there when I need it. Living in Brooklyn with a family means I need great gas mileage, the ability to modify the seating arrangements with room to spare for a quick trip for groceries, and a great sound system! I love my truck and could not imagine driving any other!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the 4WD, overall design cues (head/tail lights), I actually like the VP 16'rims more than the EXL rims. All of the power, safety, reliability, none of the frills.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2006 Accord SE for a 2008 Pilot VP. I got a great deal because SUVs are no longer in high demand and the new body style was due out the following week. I only use about 2-3 gallons more per week than I was using in the Accord, so a few extra bucks in gas is well worth the extra room for my kids (car seats, stroller, sports gear, etc). It was actually cheaper than my Accord and my insurance has decreased. Go figure.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After only one months of ownership, about 1300 miles driven, the car broke down. The following warning lights came on: "check engine", "VSA", "4 wheel drive" and "!" The car was barely moving and I called the dealership for a tow. It took 3 days to figure out what was wrong with the Pilot. Apparently some pin came out around the fuse box. Nothing major but what an aggravation! This is not my first new car purchase but my first Honda. I never expected the car to go down in 1 month. Never happened with any of my other cars. Actually, in 20 years of driving, I never had to call a tow. Now I am not sure if the car is less reliable in general than I expected or if it just had this one thing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got my 08 pilot and thought I was going to love it like all of the other Honda products I bought in past years. But it turns out, I was pretty disappointed. The suspension is too mushy to tackle anything off-road, I don't know why everyone raves about Honda's interior fit & finish, because the Pilot's is horrible.

<TEXT>Anyone looking for a GREAT deal on an 8 passenger SUV needs to take a look at the 08 Pilot. Honda is GIVING these things away to make room for the new 09 Pilot's that hit the lots over the next week or so. I was able to get my EX-L for under the TMV price and the dealer had added pin stripes, wheel locks, mud flaps and a cargo tray. I love this vehicle. I'm in sales and have already driven 5k miles in 2 months and it's a breeze to get in and out of. Huge storage space with the 3rd row folded down. It is noisy on the highway and the body lean in corners takes a little getting used to but the overall ride is nice. I looked at the VeraCruz, Journey, Pacifica and CX-9 and the Pilot is best</TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased AWD VP due to Honda great regional leasing program. Test drove both the EXL & VP, found the EXL's heated leather seat is far more comfortable and better support. EXL has lumbar support that VP does not have. The radio and climate control knobs seem to be designed for right- hand steering because the most-use knobs are located on right instead of left side. I traded the Odyssey since I want 4x4 for New England winter ice/snow and for the 90 degree turn from main street to long slope leading to my home. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Picked up my new EX-L on Saturday, by Monday the following negative traits were observed in the first fifty miles: Shudders at idle. The transmission and/or engine surges at cruising speed. Road noise is absolutely horrid at highway speeds. My eight-year-old F250 CC 4x4 is quieter. Ditto for handling. The body lean on curves and corners makes this vehicle feel like it is tipping. Even at low speeds. The aforementioned F250, with much greater height, weight, and ground clearance handles better. Suspension allows the front end to "dive" under just moderate braking. Positives: Brakes are excellent. Interior fit and finish are above average. Audio, though outdated no MP3 disc or USB.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased on Good Friday at a substantial discount (26% to be exact). It is powerful, roomy, has an excellent feature set, and big! The 2006 makeover gave it a rugged look all its own (instead of a larger 1st Gen CR-V). Gas mileage could be better, although, considering it is a 4WD, 17-18 combined city/highway isn't bad. Have slowed down considerably since moving from a Grand Prix to the Pilot, which helps with gas mileage. I'm a pretty big guy and this vehicle fits me very well . . . plenty of headroom, shoulder room, and hip room.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a brand new 2008 Pilot EX in southern California in Feb 2008. A day later, replaced a defect door trim, and about 30 days later spotted many rusty parts underside the car. Some of them appear to be very rusty and must have started a while ago. Contacted both dealer and regional Honda office. They claimed that surface rusts are not covered by the warranty and declined to fix it. So before you decide to buy a Honda, it might be a very good idea to check out the underside paint carefully. We never expect this poor paint quality. We also have a 1999 Camry. Even today, it shows no underside rust at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the '08 Pilot a week and half ago and today. I lost it to a rear end collision. The air bags did not deploy which was every odd to me because the lady that hit us was traveling at about 45 mph and we were at a dead stop for traffic. She pushed us about 10 feet forward from our original position and we hit a ford truck off set, the passenger side was toast. You can see where the crumple zones did their jobs to absorb the energy. Thank God my pregnant wife and 2 year old son where ok after the accident. If they total it I sure will get another Pilot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Would like to write a review, unfortunately, the car was been in repairs since I bought it. Heard squeaking like a fan belt slipping on day one. Returned it to dealer and they started replacing parts, (belt tensioner, alternator). Seems like they are just guessing. Tomorrow is day three and maybe will get it back then, maybe not. Fourth new Honda, third in 8 years. Will see how dealer/ Honda handles it. So far obviously not impressed. Performance and fuel economy are guesses, less than 100 miles on it.

<TEXT>The Pilot has Power on the road. I did a lot of research on several automobiles I was interested in and decided on the Pilot. I love the Pilot and I feel I made the best decision for my family. The Pilot had everything I needed in safety, comfort, and style. It had the best ratings and beat out all the other SUVs in its class. It also had the best value in price. The service at DCH Paramus Honda (NJ) was great, and my salesman was terrific. I will recommend them to family and friends whenever they need a new car.

<TEXT>I recently leased a 08 Pilot for my wife after seeing a great lease price. Our 06 Chevy trailblazer was coming off lease and although the Chevy was excellent, we opted for Honda due to the deal. The gas mileage claims are true. A 4,500lb., 4 wheel drive Chevy with 291 HP!, gets better mileage! The Honda will be in the shop 4 times due to the drive Line vibe issue someone else wrote about. Keep in mind I have been driving GM'S mostly, and they are much smoother, a lot quieter and have knocked Honda and other foreign cars off the initial and long term quality charts recently. This certainly is not like my 1998 Accord EX coupe. I miss my Chevy. Honda does have better interior</TEXT>

<TEXT>Safety and reliability is what made me look at the Pilot to replace a Toyota minivan. For the value of the current incentives, it is too good to pass up. It is a great choice for a family vehicle. The interior is logical and the exterior, well, it's a traditional SUV look. I like the Pilot but I wouldn't label it as a stand out. I do recommend it for its practical purpose and Honda's good safety name. I also feel that Honda treats their customers better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Spacious, traditional clean design, adequate or better road handling than most SUV's in the V6 class. VCM feature, and standard safety features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been researching this SUV for a while now and it far surpasses what I expected. The interior design is more for utility not luxury.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>i had chrome side steps added and that makes the pilot a mean car to see in your rear view mirror</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is one sweet ride. Have owned two other Honda's in past 10 years. Both sedans, needed more room to haul more people and stuff. The Pilot is just the ticket. The ride is smooth and very quiet. Leather heated seats are a nice plus. Room for 8 if needed. Smart styling and Honda reliability. I looked at other American made SUV's and could not do it. Honda reliability has a powerful way of keeping customers coming back. Honda's do seem to sell themselves. Well done Honda!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Field of view is outstanding from behind the drivers seat. Leather seats are very nice, Moonroof, XM radio and speaker system </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well we finally pulled the trigger and purchased the 2008 Pilot EX-L AWD. We first test drove the VP, then the EX- L. The leather seats are far more comfortable, heated seats too! Nice...It handles very well, plenty of zip, and Honda reliability. I thought about buying an American product for about 2 seconds, then came to my senses. This is our third new Honda, Civic/Accord, now Pilot. My fellow Americans, before you buy anything else, test drive this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather seats- heated :)my rear likes that, power seats, Moon Roof, capability to drop seats into various configurations to haul stuff.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We replaced our 2005 Chrysler Pacifica (boat) with this truck and are loving it. The Pilot is so much lighter on it's feet and nimble in the urban jungle. Driving is quiet and smooth on all roads and it's great in the snow! Wife loves that it heats up quick on sub-zero MN winter mornings. Husband loves the acceleration and visibility from sitting up high in the cockpit. Kids love the DVD and parents love the wireless headsets for quiet long trips to grandparents.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet smooth ride, sure footing/traction in snow, Honda reliability(we have an 06' Accord w/ 64k miles on it, never been in the shop). Heats up fast on cold Minnesota mornings! Cell phone holder in foldout of main console. Fog lights really light up the road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have been driving our new VP AWD Pilot for almost a month now and absolutely love it! We decided to take the plunge because of the horrible weather we've been having in the MidWest and we also plan to start a family soon. I've owned many Honda's, so owning a Pilot was always a goal of mine. I have to say that it has delivered up to my expectations hands- down. We plan to add a few extras like a towing package, all season floor mats, and a remote starter in the near future. We only went with the base VP model without all the bells and whistles and everyone still compliments on how nice and luxurious it looks. We were comparing the Pilot to many other SUV's and it easily beat them out.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love all the safety features of this thing! The auto-shut off for the passenger airbag if there is less than 70lbs in the seat. Full side airbags throughout the vehicle. Tire pressure and oil life monitoring systems. Multiple cup holders and outlets throughout cabin are also nice. Good job Honda!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 2008 Honda Pilot is a great deal, pricewise (especially with big rebates now) and quality. Honda has had over 5 yrs to work out any bugs from an already solid SUV, so I feel like I own one of the most reliable vehicles on the road. In addition, it has enough pep, is versatile and roomy inside (we love the 60/40 split 3rd row seat for extra passengers when needed without shuffling around the car seats in the second row). It rides like a heavy-feeling, rather sporty car instead of a "floaty" truck- like truck. It?s a Honda with great resale.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Price. Easy to use voice command controls for everything from climate control to Navigation. Ride. 3rd row seat. Fit and finish. Firm, heated seats with high-quality leather trim </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We recently traded in a Volvo XC90 for the Pilot and are loving it. The interior is quite spacious and having a third row seat is a wonderful convenience. The interior integrity compared to other makes we looked at does not compare. I think we will keep this car for awhile.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had a 2004 Pilot loved it and bought the 2wd 2008. Great car and love the Honda's reliability.Gas mileage on the 2wd seems much better than my 2004. Live in Ohio and 2wd doesn't seem much different than my 2004 awd. Love the XM feature on the radio, no more looking for stations on trips. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded my 04 Pilot in for a new one. They gave me 20k for my 04 with 52K on it. They are aggressively pricing these whick is why I bought a new one now. More importantly you cannot find a better built, more reliable, reasonably priced vehicle on the market today. It is the best of all worlds. Part mini-van, suv, 4 wheel drive vehicle with good gas mileage. If you are looking for a family car, look no further. This is one of the best cars on the market and their price hasn't changed much since I bought mine previous one on 04.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've had our Honda Pilot for one month and love it! The stereo sounds great from the front seat, but needs the base turned up to sound as good in the back seat. It's very comfortable during long rides, and fun to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice smooth ride, and very quiet, except on noisy roads. We love the storage spaces and cup holders, which are scattered throughout the car. The second and third row seats fold down easily to provide additional space. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We searched for an suv that was large enough to be comfortable yet economical to operate and affordable. We found it in the Pilot. We test drove several before the Pilot and was not impressed enough to lay down the money. This impressed the both of us. It had what we needed and wanted with a couple of extra's that are nice. We like the room, the engine performance,third row seating for the grandkids,cargo area is great and the dependabilty factor played a large part of our decision. </TEXT>

<TEXT>With 4 months and 3,000 miles now logged I feel I can offer some insight. With the Honda nameplate you obviously are getting a quality vehicle. I'm planning on getting 10 years/110,000 miles out of it and then handing down to my son in elementary school for college use. I did lots of research beforehand and wanted the optional 3rd row w/out having a huge vehicle. Bingo! My colleagues piled in for a trip with the 6' 1" guy choosing to sit in the way back. He said he was comfortable...but he didn't look it. They all commented on how much bigger it looked and felt inside than what they thought it would be. I upgraded from a Jeep Gr. Cherokee, and this is hands-down far superior. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Firm ride and handling-much less truck- like than you'd expect. Some people complained about seat comfort, but I think it's great feeling of safety with keds in the car (loaded w/ airbags-and very solid) Entertainment system and conversation mirror are great for trips w/ the kids</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my 2008 Pilot EX-L with navigation after considering all other SUVs. The most important considerations in selecting it were safety, room for 8 if needed, comfort, and flexibility to go in snow and travel on moderately rough unpaved forest roads. I also wanted a vehicle with driver's compartment space for stowage of essential gear. The navigation system and XM radio have made driving more efficient and travel more enjoyable. Thus far, my Pilot has met all of my expectations. Fuel consumption has been quite reasonable considering vehicle weight. Ride has been very comfortable on 10+ hour trips. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Favorite features are ease of driving, accessibility and readability of instruments, comfortable seats, sound system, navigation system, visibility of road, and plenty of room for luggage, etc.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this vehicle. It is everything I could have asked for in a suv. I love the fact that it seats eight. I don't know how comfortable it would be for an adult to sit in the third row but kids would be just fine back there. My husband bought this vehicle for me for my 30th birthday and I am ecstatic!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After totalling my Chevy TrailBlazer, and then rushing to buy a GMC Yukon, I wanted a vehichle with a fold flat third row, 4wd, rear entertainment system, and lots of extras. I found it all with my Pilot Special Edition, with kids we knew we didn't want leather. I haven't had to use the 4wd yet, but hope it's everything Honda promises. It seems noiser than my Yukon, and not as comfortable, but I was willing to compromise given the rest of the goodies. The gas mileage is reasonable. In town, I get about 16-17 mpg, and 20-21 on the highway (at ~70mph). So far, everything rings true to the Honda value.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I already own a 2004 Honda Pilot. I test drove comparable Toyota, Nissan, and Acura SUVs. Honda is the best car/value Bar none. They've made so much enhancements to the Pilot since 2004 that I feel like I am driving a different car. Navigation is easy to use and I love the XM radio. I also like the fact that rear camera and fog light is now standard on Navigation model. I simply love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought to replace an aging Isuzu Rodeo we're very happy with our Pilot. The Pilot is comfortable, a pleasure to drive, and of course Honda reliability. Acceleration is very good and noise levels are reasonable. The 2nd and 3rd row seats are easy to use and, folded down, they provide a large cargo area. Leather trim is nicely done and the two-tone effect of the Saddle color is attractive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>You can fold down the 2nd row seats with the headrests on. If you fold the seats often this is a big time saver. Climate control works well and is easy to use.</FAVORITE>
