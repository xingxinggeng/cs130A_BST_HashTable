<FAVORITE>The only good thing worth mentioning is the XM Radio!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my G-5 last July as sort of an impulse buy, part of the "new me" I wish I would have done more research on this vehicle. I also wish I would have known that Pontiac was going under and that right now i can buy my car for as cheap as $10,000! Anyways, I drive my car 90 miles round trip to school and it's never left me on the side of road. In the year i've had it though, its been to the shop twice for annoying squeeks. One is in the rear brakes (they said nothing was wrong), and the sunroof squeeks. Also, when i make a turn the car twist and pops the sunroof out of the roof. The crome on the door handles peeled off. The warranty for Pontiac is nice, but not bringing it in for repairs.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior look, definately the radio, LOVE the tire pressure sensors, and my leather seats!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This was my first car. I got it brand new in 2008 as a 2008 model. Its really fun to drive, sporty looking, and quick for its powertrain. The Pontiac G5 hasnt given me any trouble, and im getting 30.3 mpg average. I baby my car, keeping it clean and not dogging it, only go above 3500 RPMS every so often to hear her hum. People always want to race because it looks so sporty...Victory Red. Love the car, would recommend it to anyone!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM Radio, IPOD Connection, Cruise on steering wheel, 6 pages of favorites on radio, radio is loud for stock, and my favorite the 2.2L engine...quick from take off, and the driver information center. (MPG average and INST, tire pressure, oil life, miles, a b trip, tank fuel economy and coolant.)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So I gave Pontiac a second chance. I traded my 2005 Pontiac G6 in for a 2008 Pontaic G5. This car stinks. Been in the shop too many times for a new car. Motors replaced in windows and locks. Seat belts replaced, failed. And now with only 10,000 miles on it replacing brakes. The engine is loud for a 4 cyl. Chrome peeling off the door handles. Pontiac stinks. I gave them a second chance and I no longer will drive one. Gas mileage stinks, I'm lucky to get 24 miles to the gallon, maybe, if I drove 55 on the California freeways, I think not.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I would have to say the XM radio and ipod connection</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is good for someone buying their first new vehicle. Other than that stay away from this car. The inside is plastic, and feels like its going to fall apart. The handling is crappy and that is putting it nicely. It is supposed to have about 148 HP but it feels like 100. The suspension is terrible. The road noise is outrageous and the radio signal is bad. You get static all the time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my Pontiac in May brand new and it ran great until it started getting cold out. Then it decided to have problems starting.We tried jumping it and nothing happened. I have had it in the shop 3 times for the same problem. 1st they asked if I pressed the clutch in far enough, 2nd they replaced the ignition, and 3rd they replaced the starter not to mention they had to put a hose on the radiator due to a recall and fix a leak in the windshield and do some work in the transmission due to grinding when going into 4th gear. So my advice, get the extended warranty, you will need it</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car this past January, but was disappointed. I really only bought it for the gas mileage (since gas prices were peaking just over $4.00 per gallon!). I'm an avid weightlifter, a big guy (6'2 260). I have a small waist (I wear a size 33 inch/34 length cargo pants) but I have very large arms and very broad shoulders. My point is, my upper body feels too cramped in a car this size, and there is not much headroom. Bigger guys definitely should not purchase this car because I guarantee you that you will not be comfortable!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car has decent acceleration, the interior styling is much improved over the now discontinued Sunfire, the XM radio and OnStar are awesome features to have!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My job involves driving over an extensive area, and the mileage I get with my G5 is worth every penny that I spend on gas (30-32 mpg highway, 25-29 mpg city). The driver information system alerts are also very helpful - so far only needed for traction and tire pressure. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my G5 preferred package in competition yellow for 4 months now and I love it. I like that there are not many on the road so people tend to do a double take when I drive by. Lots of people wanna race (maybe because it's yellow) which I think is ridiculous with fuel prices being so high. I commute 74 miles one way to work on highways, freeways and city streets with lots of hills and I am averaging 29.5 mpg. Just as good as a scion tc but way cheaper.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM radio, white gauges by day, red at night. Looks sporty. Great suspension and handling. Gutsy engine. Onboard computer is really helpful. Have put 12,500 miles in 4 months and haven't had any problems. 100,000 mile warranty is awesome.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2004 Mazda 3 for the new G5 with automatic tranny. Even the dealer asked me why I was trading the "great" Mazda for the Pontiac. But the Mazda was a piece of junk. Over $2k in repairs after warranty. So far I'm happy with the little Pontiac. I like the black exterior too. I got the preferred package with the nice 16" wheels/ABS. But my gas mileage has been poor so far. Only averaging about 24 mpg. Maybe 30 on the highway. But So Cal gas stinks too. I would recommend the car for the reasonable price easily instead of the overpriced, underfeatured Japanese makes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All of the standard safety features and traction control. Good power once on highway. 100K warranty covers the engine and tranny.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my G5 six months ago - so far, it has exceeded my expectations. My daily commute is 57 miles round-trip, 90% highway. I'm averaging 32.5 MPG, despite the 4-speed auto transmission. The 4-cyl Ecotec has plenty of power and the cabin is quiet for an economy car. The tire-pressure monitor alerted me to an air leak in one of my tires caused by a nail BEFORE I drove on the Interstate - very nice. The climate control system is excellent - HOT heat and COLD AC. I like the firm, supportive seats - like a VW's and very comfortable over long trips. If you like soft, cushy, couch cushions, this isn't the car for you.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>+ Onboard computer & driver info center. + Very nice radio head unit with XM. + Very firm seats and supportive seats. + Attractive exterior and nice, dark interior. + Highway mileage + Ridiculously easy to change the oil. VERY well designed cartridge oil filter system - you won't spill a drop.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have had our G5 a short while. But I have to say! The car has performed up to it's consumer ratings and some. I would highly suggest this car for anyone. A lot of fun to drive. Very sporty looking. And gets great fuel mileage. Very cool little car. Will make you feel young again. We had a 2006 Dodge Charger. Nothing but problems with it. I have always been interested in Pontiac. Until now! I can say! If you have a interest in the G5. Go for it! You will not regret it. We absolutely love our G5.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is simple but well done. We love the instrument panel. And the stereo is great. XM radio is awesome.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my car about a month ago in June. I am always finding a way to drive my car, or I am always telling my friends and family I will drive! I love getting up in morning to go to work so I can just drive my car! I am also loving the gas mileage!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love my XM, Not much outside noise when going down the road! Cruise control and comfort, air condition will freeze you out!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 5th car. I have owned a 86 grand am, 84 fiero, 00 grand am gt, and a 04 dodge stratus. I traded in my stratus for this car. I have no regrets! This car is day/night comparison to my stratus. Drives nicer, more leg room in the back, nicer stereo, much more power, and gets much better gas mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sunroof, 6-disk cd changer, on star, pioneer system, remote start, not very many around like the cobalt. I'm 1 out of 11 G5s in my county which is a fairly good sized. I get 31.2 mpg average short trips less than 7 miles per trip.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second car. I bought it for the price and the fuel economy. I have a 5-speed and get 29mpg City. I would highly recommend it as a stylish alternative to the "bubbly" fuel economy cars. It rides beautifully and quietly for a standard. However, I have had it back to the dealer TWICE because of problems with the ignition and my keys not being recognized by the car. They said it was not a "recall" on the car, but there is a "bulliten" on this problem. So, beware.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Automatic headlights, the doors unlock when you turn the car off, easy to use radio and controls while driving, comfortable seating.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased this in May '08. I test drove the Chevy Cobalt and ended up liking this a lot. Gas mileage is fairly good. (25 city/32 hwy). Price is right too. Beats buying the Japanese products!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The dealership was amazing and nice but I have had a problem where every time I go to give it gas or go up on a hill it will pull and roar. It's not suppose to do that. I took it to the dealership and they said there was nothing wrong with it. I'm going to continue to take it to the dealer until the problem is fixed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>When it turns dark my speedometer lights up and my radio and lights turn on. I also love the the way the radio is set up.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this G5 as a "go to work" vehicle. Solid performer. Drive train (engine & transmission) are very smooth and responsive. I got 7,000 miles on it and I'm averaging about 29.5 mpg (mostly interstate driving). Road noise is minimal. Limited visibility on the passenger side "blind spot".</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Trip computer / tire pressure sensor. Radio quality and features with XM.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ordered this car to replace 1999 Sunfire in October and have been very satisfied with the performance of this car. This car replaced the Sunfire and Pontiac responded to all the Sunfire owners on how to improve it. The ride is much smoother and the handling with the improved suspension is great. It has a lot of the features that more expensive cars have at a lesser price. Handles well in snow!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine performance, comfort, information center, smooth ride for this size of car, good trunk size, good factory stereo system </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car about one month ago and I can say I am very happy, excellent ride, very comfortable seating, good cornering , nice style, small and fuel efficient, what else could you want, for this price? I am very happy i have had many GM cars in the past, like the impala, century, malibu and they were all great, reliable vehicles. Overall recommended. At least test drive one and you'll see what I am talking about.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In the time I have now owned my 2008 Pontiac G5, I have absolutely found nothing I have not liked about he vehicle. It was a steal at the price, with the five year warranty, plus it has all the extras that I wouldn't have been able to afford if I had bought the competitor vehicles such as the chevy cobalt. The car handles great, gets competative gas mileage, no better or worse than any other small car, and it is so quiet while running, and has great brakes in comoparison to other cars I have driven. It was definitely a great buy for my as a college student, but it wouldn't be something I would reccommend to a really tall person, as it would be too tiny, or someone with kids.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The fact that the car locks only when it is in gear, it automatically unlocks when it is in park! love that! Plus, I like the screen on dash that tells how many psi are in each tire.</FAVORITE>
