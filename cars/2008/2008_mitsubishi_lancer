<TEXT>I am in the military in the middle of nowhere, so I get a whole lot of highway miles. However, I am from Chicago so I am very much a city driver. The GTS fulfills my needs. My only after market modification is a K&N cold air, and my GTS is superb. Handling is definitely sharp, brakes and safety are more than what you can ask for. Lacks a bit of top end speed but with the right shifting you can overcome more than you think.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 4b11 mivec engine is awesome, and I love the bluetooth, especially useful in California.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my lancer for 2 years now and I work at a GM dealership believe it or not. I love my lancer. I was surprised to see all the problems that people were having with paint chipping and noise in the cabin as I have not experienced any of these. I have the GTS with AWD and it handles absolutely beautiful on the snow here in upstate New York. I'm going to keep this car till it hits 200-300k. In the meantime I am buying a 2010 Camaro for a toy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Loved this car, I have the ES. Nice cheap car to get you around. Have taken it to Dallas and back a few times which is about 4.5 hours away from me. Loved driving it every mile of the way. Haven't had any problems with it at all yet. The engine doesn't feel that luckluster for a tiny 4 cylinder which is good. Car is amazingly sharp when just putting tint on the windows and giving it a good wash. A real looker. Gas mileage is awesome, I drive the highway to work and back and get around 33mpg when I don't use the a/c. Very very nice car, I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't have kids. Backseat is a little small.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sirius radio built in! Bluetooth built in. This car can turn on a dime. Gas mileage rawks too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had the 08 Lancer ES with the sun and sound package for a year now. I've found it extremely enjoyable. I added a K+N air filter, and an axle back Flowmaster 40 series exhaust, and noticed a performance increase and MPG increase immediately. The sound system is great, gives a nice rounded sound without being overbearing. The transmission is smooth, and the car can be tossed around with relative ease. I love the interior design, there's beauty in simplicity. Everything is integrated into the dash, making it flow wonderfully. The only complaint I have is that after a year, the padding used on the rear dash to deaden rattles has worn out, causing vibrations with the music. Annoying.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>New style, inside and out. Unlike others, I LOVE the sound of the engine. I like to hear whatever I'm driving. The dashboard is a brilliant design. No seams from a detachable radio interface, and a wonderful flow throughout the cabin. Amazing backseat room for a compact sedan.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought in 07-Drawn in by the great new design I decided to give Mitsu a chance. They were rude from the start and never should have bought this car. Had problems with tires, window leaking, sunroof, the car pulls to the left, TERRIBLY CHEAP paint- hundreds of tiny paint chips. Brought the car in over 15 times in the 1.5 yrs I had it. I was always upset over the problems and no one cared. I spoke to everyone that worked at Mitsu and they were disrespectful and rude. I have never been treated so badly. I asked them to check out the paint and that was months ago and never heard back. No matter how good this car looks, do not get it. I hate the comp so much I took a hit and traded it in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I overall was excited at the purchase of this car. Based on the reviews previously I had read & thought wow this car will have everything I've been looking for. Afterthoughts of ownership - 1.5 yrs - car is lacking in quality at build. From day one I had asked the tech about engine noise above 2500 rpm. The cabin is always filled with noises of some kind. Recently, the rattles from the doors are killing me. I warn those who buy this vehicle that any car that gives you a rebate will come back to bite you in the end. When they give a 5k rebate, that means you're now 5k down in what you paid for it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the style of the body & the curves/lines. The upgrade from the previous body style really helps to attract buyers who need that "Look at me" feeling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My Lancer looks awesome with the body kit straight from the manufacturer and the exceptional look of the front end. But I live in central Pennsylvania and my car is not looking good after only three months of winter. I was told to purchase mud flaps to prevent chipping, and when I went to purchase the flaps after I bought the car, the dealership informed me they do not make them for the ES body type. Now not only is it chipping but there are 8inch strips of paint by the back doors that are gone. THIS IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY BECAUSE IT WAS BROUGHT ON BY AN OUTSIDE SOURCE. Do you think it may have something to do with the paint or the way the car was designed????????</TEXT>

<TEXT>Many complain that gas mileage is "poor under hard acceleration, no HID lights, no leather option, etc." This is an economy car people!!!! Of course mileage is bad when you drive aggressively, HID's come on cars that are typically $25K+ (as well as leather). I will review this car for exactly what it is and against it's competitors. The build quality is horrible. Paint is very bad as well. Mileage is excellent, though. Interior materials rattle, interior noise can be deafening. It's not "exciting" to drive, nor is it fast. SUV's smoked me at on-ramps. It looks good though. For the same price, VW Rabbit, Mazda 3, etc are all better choices. I got rid of my Lancer after 5 months.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the 08 new and have had it now for a little over a year. I have the "sun and fun" package along with the wing on the rear. The only real flaw I can think of is that the car should have had a 6th gear. Gas mileage would have been far better and the wear and tear on the engine would be reduced. I would buy it again </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my 2008 Mitsubishi Sedan ES Manual with 41,225 miles. It never gave me any problems except for getting use on those computer gadget on the dash. I live in the northeast and drive on Interstate 95 all the time 7 days a week sunny or nor'easter. Who said it's bad on snow? I realized it is not the car it's the tires. I almost hit the railing on 95 but the car tremendously responded on my driving and avoided a total wreck. No power? Just use 4th gear all the time to pass cars. it can pass 2 to 3 cars in a second especially with a manual. The secret is learn to drive this car. "You control the Lancer Don't let the Lancer control you." The Lancer is fast just be aggressive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Okay there is the DE Lancer the ES Lancer and the GTS, I own the GTS and I just don't see the point, because it looks just like the others. I have the CVT transmission which makes the 0-60 an astonishing 11.7 seconds. It is extremely underpowered and overpriced for that power, you can get the same car in the DE or the ES. you can order the same accessories as well. The car weighs 3100 lbs, and puts 139 hp to the wheels. I put rims on my GTS and it looks amazing, but needless to say wouldn't they all. I would also say get it without the spoiler if you ever hope to see out of the rear window. It is a great car I can say that!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation is extremely easy to use and awesome to find different restaurants. The paddle shifters are cool if you don't want to down shift. It handles like an F1 car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have this car in Silver without a wing. The wingless lancer looks classy especially in silver. Added limo tints to the back half of the car. This adds amazing privacy for that luxuriously large back seat area (if ya know what I mean). Also if you take time to notice, the fabric used for the seats is perfect and very cleanable (much better than leather would be). I couldn't ask for sportier gauges. Thanks Mitsubishi. If 152 HP isn't enough, slap an intake an exhaust on it, you'll pass TCs, Civics and Mazda 3s. I must say when driving this car, I feel very in control of it. Many other cars don't compare. I adore my cars spacious interior so much. It's not just a car. It's an adventure. Thanks Mitsubishi.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>-VERY ROOMY interior (especially in back) -Sturdy and Responsive handling -Facial features -Bright headlights VERY bright hi beams -Comfortable seats in front and back. -GAS MILEAGE got it up to 44.1 MPG doing 55 MPH!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had the car for over a year now and i regret to say that im not impressed. From the first time it was driven off the lot i noticed that it was a very noisy engine. From a stop there is no power, getting in the third from second gear is a different story. Overall, the car is very nice. It is a seriously big jump from previous generations of Lancers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>LANCER 5 speed is a cheap car with better gas mileage than predicted. I get 25 in the city and 37 on the road. It needs a 6th gear however, the rpm are high on the highway after about 60 mph. It's very peppy and easy to drive. Has a horrible blind spot on left side. The "fast key" and map system are bogus and the time clock takes forever to display. However, it's economy and fun to drive make up for the blind spot (bought a blind spot mirror). This is my third Mitsubishi, the cars do very well overall. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Had the GTS CVT for over half a year now, and I have to say, this car is extremely fun to drive. I paid a tad too much for this car, but it was worth every single penny. This car is great, looks aggressive, perfect for those teenage drivers like myself. Although I have to say I'm a little disappointed in the engine power, it's a blast to drive. The 152 hp engine could be a little better, certainly the 09 GTS with the 2.4 L 168 hp engine will be much faster. The fuel economy is rather good on this car. I get about on average 21 to 22 MPG. But for me this is hard to obtain because as a teenage driver, accelerating slowly doesn't give me a rush of adrenaline. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation system, and the sound package. The 600 watt sound system will give u the thrill. The handling on this car is superb. It can take corners easily. The sport tuned suspension is a great addition to this 08 Lancer. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought my GTS 4 months ago and i am really enjoying it! Exterior looks great, i get compliments wherever i go. It lacks a bit of power at first but fast once up to speed, and extremely fun to drive. I have taken it to a few mountain passes and driven it along the California coast and i couldn't be happier with it. The car handles very well with very good steering feel, although with the 18" stock wheels on the GTS it can be jarring at times. Rockford system sounds great and the sun roof is a plus. Plenty of room for me and three friends. My only complaint is the use of some cheap plastics on the interior which tend to rattle a little with the sub turned up. Overall tho i LOVE this car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks great. Stock 18" wheels get attention. Handles very well with improved suspension on the GTS and multi-link rear. Rockford-Fosgate system is one of the best stock systems out there. Pretty good mileage (about 28/30 for me)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first review was under the name Adam S. Just an FYI to all reading this. The car has been holding up pretty well. My only issues with the car has been the stock Dunlops which the dealership swapped out. They had a pulling issue from day 1 & they put on Pirelli P-Zero Neros instead. Now the car doesn't handle quite as well. Hopefully they will be better in the winter. The Dunlops were pretty scary! The paint on this car chips very easily! The front & right behind the rear doors my car looks awful! The Navi system is only current up to 2006! That is ridiculous! Mitsu's customer service has been quite poor. But overall, 10K later, the car has never given me any trouble. A+ for that.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Still the Fast Key system. Navi w/ 30gig hard drive. Looks. Mileage! Doing normally 55-60 on my 37 mile trip to work, I avg. now around 35- 38 MPG! Best so far has been a click OVER 38 for the whole tank. It can be done!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Me and my wife both love this car. 13,000 km on it now and preforms great. The style is the best on the road for a sedan. the warranty in Canada is the best on the road. Wish I could have had the 2.4 from the 09, might have more power. Not an overall fan of the CVT. I drove this car in heavy snow all winter and it preformed great. Temperature hit -40 and relays blew with only 2000 km on it. Moisture out of the factory they said. The joys of a new car I guess. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased a 2008 GTS in Dec 07, only to get rid of it shortly thereafter. The right front door rattled terribly and the dealership kept pretending not to hear it. They also refused to print work orders for my car. The windshield wipers went out on me in the pouring down rain for about 5 minutes on the highway during rush hour. The subwoofer in the trunk became dismounted within the first week of me having the car. Ended up getting an 08 Nissan Altima Coupe. I love it. Better quality car and comes with better customer service.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. It's my first "new" car and for the price I am 100% satisfied with what I got. I love the sound of the mivec when you get on it a little. There has only been a couple things I don't love about my new lancer: I wish the 5 speed had another gear; when I am cruising at 70 and my rpm are just over 3k, I feel like I am straining it even though I'm not. (it does have some crazy response in 5th though, jumping up into the triple digits with just a little push!) and gas mileage could be a little better especially with the way prices are going. But in all, I'm very happy with the car. Its a joy to drive every day!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The thing that I like most about this car, is that even at the base model the entire car looks aggressive. You didn't get that with the previous years. I have the ES 5 SP with the 650 Watt stereo and I love it. I'm 6'4" and had to scoot the seat closer for comfort. The new forward swept windshield keeps the sun out of your eyes, great feature in Florida. The engine is quick to respond for a 2.0 L, and you're hitting 80 before you know it. The gas mileage leaves a bit to be desired, but it's not horrible. The interior is wonderful, doesn't feel like it was built with cheap plastic parts. And the AUX port to plug in the iPod, thank god. I'm able to carry my entire music library. Great car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has lots of features that would cost some serious green with other competitors. The Nav and sound system alone is good enough for a purchase. The car itself, unfortunately could have have been better. I found it sluggish. The CVT is almost unbearable. It feels like it's being pushed to catch up with the engine. The car screams to get going from a starting position. I think that a regular automatic would have been a better choice. This engine is supposed to be lighter and have impressive HP for it's size. My Suzuki Reno is faster getting to 60. Other CVTs in the market don't feel like this. I crank the radio up so I don't hear the motor. It also gets poor gas mileage on hard acceleration.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Like the Mitsu NAV sys and it's impressive features build in. Also like the sound system, paddle shifters and steering mounted controls. Overall design is good. The 18" wheels are a great addition.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wow!! What is there not to say about this car. I've had it for almost a year and already put 16k on the thing. I can't leave it parked in the driveway, it's just to sexy for that. It definitely needs to be opened up to get best results. I have the fully loaded GTS, has nav, blue-tooth, great system and don't forget the paddle shifters. The new Lancer gets great gas mileage and is extremely fun to drive. I do enjoy the keyless entry, however, don't leave the car on and take the remote out too many times, soon it will tell you the key is missing even though its not. This car is definitely a "Head Turner".</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I definitely like the navigation the most. The keyless entry is cool, no need to have a key, the alarm system is excellent, no one can ever break in without the remote! The paddle shifters are amazing and blue-tooth technology is great for me. Love the MP3 player, records up to 150 cd's. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a great car!! I cant say enough about it!! i was worried when i bought it, going from an Infiniti to a Mitsu. Boy was i wrong. Much quicker response, funner to driver, more sportier. Don't let the 2.0L engine scare you, this thing is flying down the road before you know it. The CVT really makes that possible! I Have the fully loaded GTS with nav. It's ridiculous how many options you get for such a small price. I paid twice as much for my Infiniti and got a lot less.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 6 weeks of owning the car and 3,000 miles I noticed Paint chips on the side in front of the rear tires. I took it to the dealer and they took pictures and sent them to Mitsubishi and they said they wouldn't cover it that it was my fault. The front tires kick off stones causing a sandblasting to the side of the car. They said they didn't make mud flaps for them yet. It gets worse everyday. I see more people are having the same problem. I am now filling out paper work for the attorney General. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was told at the sale of the 2008 Lancer that it would be "fine" in the snow. Much to my dismay, it was completely the opposite. I first discovered just how scary this car was on a snow covered slight uphill driveway when the whole front end slid to the right! There was absolutely no traction from the tires and when I called the dealership, they suggested I get snow tires to the tune of $1300. They did offer to mount/balance them at a discount, however I was very disappointed. I was unable to drive my NEW car during predicted snowstorms and when I got caught in a few "dustings", I was unable to get up my driveway and once barely made it down the road! Has anyone used snow tires? Did it work</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned the car for 3 weeks now and put fuel in it twice. I am averaging 27.5 mpg in a city/hwy mix while being rather aggressive with the throttle. Not as good as I could get with a smaller car but I am 6-4 300 lbs and I'm comfortable in the Lancer. The car has plenty of HP and torque. I have found myself doing 90mph on the freeway without much effort. Getting around town is effortless. At 6'4" I actually have the drivers seat up a notch which surprised me. The back seat provides enough room for 2 kids (1 in a car seat). Seats are comfortable too. The gauges are laid out well and the car performs all the functions that it should rather well. I need more room to write the review</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>FAST Key-I love that my keys stay in my pocket. Don't need them to get into or start the car. Plenty of room for my big rear, the wife and two kids.

<TEXT>The car has decent room w/ comfortable seats for long trips (folding in the rear 4 more cargo space). It has great features like the GPS, hands free Bluetooth, 650W stereo w/ the 30GB hard disk w/ Sirius and especially the Fast Key! The CVT is really smooth and the paddle shifting is fun w/its 6 dedicated gears. The 2.0 engine is surprisingly peppy, though just not off the line. Mileage has been much better than I expected w/ 33-40+MPG doing 55-65 mph on the highway and no less than 26+ around town. Overall ride is well controlled & neve r harsh. Handling is really fun in this car and the brakes are also really good.</TEXT>

Anymore (i.e., Ralliart or Evo) would just get me into trouble. If you are more concerned with excellent looks and cutting-edge tech goodies at a great price, you cannot beat this car.</TEXT>

So far the car's been great sure we all want more power but for the money I think its pretty peppy of course low end torque could get more work but satisfied overall. Can't wait for all the upgrades since its the same engine as the Evo yay!</TEXT>

This car has the looks and prestige of an Acura TL for many many thousands less, 650 watt stereo, 30 gig hard drive to store cds, navigation that is able to play DVDs! This is my third Mitsubishi vehicle, one of which I retired after 328,000 miles!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did my research and test drove a lot of cars. This car is by far the most car for the money! I got a loaded Lancer for the base price of other brands (altima, etc.). I've had my car for 4 months now and I am very happy with everything! Love the car, especially the extras. Get a lot of looks on the road and family and friends love it! I haven't looked back since I got it. It makes driving fun again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a fully loaded Lancer GTS manual with sun and sound package and navigation, Love it, car gets better fuel economy that I expected, combined city/hwy of 29.3mpg and straight hwy at about 34 or so. Not bad when usually traveling at about 75mph. The only complaint I have is the car pulls slightly to the left and my dealership has stated there is no issue. I am hoping they will get it resolved soon as I went back and test drove another GTS and found no noticeable pull. I am starting to think that the suspension might need adjustment as the other GTS I tested had a much tighter steering which I preferred.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav works perfectly it can even locate my work (a building that has been there since 1970 that my tomtom could not locate). Sound system is a nice upgrade and fuel economy better than expected.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2000 Firebird Formula on a 2008 Lancer GTS. I was shocked at how great the performance was on the GTS. The CVT takes some getting used to, but with the paddle shifters I'm able to manuever in traffic fairly easily. The car feels faster than the specs lead you to believe. The technology of this car is amazing. I got the optional DVD navigation system with the 30 GB hard drive. I'm able to store 100 CDs on the hard drive which is very nice. I love the fuel economy too. I've been averaging 26 mpg and using regular gas, so I'm saving a ton of money compared to my firebird. I would definitely recommend this car to anyone looking for a sporty practical car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It was very nice at first then unusual stuff started happening to the car. Stuff Mitsubishi won't cover. For example, earlier this week, I was driving down the highway at 60 mph. There was no one on the road in front of me and there was no overpass. Clear skies. All of a sudden I heard an explosion right above me. It was the sunroof. Glass started flying off the back of my car from the sunroof. I had no idea what just happened and am absolutely positive that nothing hit the car. After getting the run around from the dealership and their hot line, and finding proof this happened to other people (there's an entire forum with people with similar stories) They still said they would not cover it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It looks great, has a lot of features for the price but it really really needs more power!! The engine is small and very noisy! Every time you try to accelerate from a traffic stop or even worse, at the toll booth the poor engine screams. Except for this, the car is really great. The CVT is nice, the paddle shifters are even nicer and in my opinion the next better looking car on the road is in the $35/40k zone . The Lancer is really a head-turner, stylish, sporty, remarkable!</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I first saw the commercial for this car I was very intrigued. When my truck died I needed a new daily driver car. I test drove it and ended up buying it the same day. Sadly, after a month the problems crept up. It?s been in the shop for 10 total days now because of warranty issues. Anyone who has the nav system and the Rockford sound system try this: turn on the accessories but don?t start the car. Watch a DVD or listen to your radio for an hour. Then start your car. On two separate occasions, my car shorted out its throttle body. 8800 total miles on it, inexcusable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded my Montero Sport which I loved but it didn't have any toys in it. Shopped for weeks and no other car or SUV could offer 1/2 of the options my Lancer GTS has for the price I paid. I got everything including dealer aftermarket leather which I love. I almost went with the aqua but I am so glad I changed my mind and got the Graphite Grey with tinted windows. It looks so sporty but, still very classy. Even with the suggested improvements I note, I have no regrets whatsoever... okay one, I really wanted a nav system with real time traffic maps.

<TEXT>The 2008 Lancer GTS is almost where it needs to be. It looks the part, but if it had more juice it could play the part. I have owned several cars and looked at/drove several others prior to this purchase. Bottom line up front: you get your money's worth with this car. The ride is firm and balanced, not too harsh. It looks interesting both inside and out. It is on the verge of replacing the Honda Civic, Scion tC and Mazdaspeed3 as the next tuner favorite. The CVT is a pleasure to have along with the other tech-worthy toys inside. Mine is a daily driver, but will also be my hobby to add upgrades to. My intent is to find the hidden horsepower that Mitsubushi neglected to give the GTS.</TEXT>

Everything about the car, from displays and gadgets to handling and mpg, this car meets every one of my needs and wants!!

<TEXT>My wife and I recently picked out this car as we wanted to go from a two vehicle household down to one to save some money. We sold her 07 Honda Fit and traded in my Nissan Armada towards the Lancer GTS w/ nav and tech package and sun and sound package. Have not looked back since. This car looks beautiful and turns lots of heads on the roadway. For all the features you get (safety and tech-wise) you really can't beat it at all, not for the money anyway. Far too many Accords and Altimas out there, do yourself a favor and at least test drive the 08 Lancer GTS!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation system (beats many aftermarket systems) with Music Server and Hands Free Bluetooth calling. The exterior design looks far more like a BMW/Audi than it does a Kia/Scion.

<TEXT>I really wanted a 2007 Mustang, but I started comparing, and chose this one. I couldn't be happier. I got an Electric Blue Lancer GTS with the nav system. The car runs smoothly, handles well, and looks great. With 18" wheels, the ride can be a little rough, but that's ok. The car is gorgeous. I get looks where ever I go. I've used three tanks so far and get good mpg, about 32 hwy and 26 city. The paddle shifters are fun, but prefer to use the stick to hold it into 2nd gear for acceleration. And so far, that's the only real draw back, it can be hard to get up to speed in auto-mode. But, kick it into manual mode, and all that goes away. I don't regret my choice at all.</TEXT>

Handles great, stereo system is awesome (Rockford), lots of features for your money. You do hear a lot of road noise and engine noise. I think they need a quieter engine. It sounds like it's knocking. They took away from the quality of the interior for all of the electronic features. I love this car, though, it's fun to drive.

I just wish this car, the GTS variant that is, was given more power and I do agree with another reviewer that it should be about 10-20 more horses. Despite that, the car handles greatly thanks to a solid chassis that also is begging for more power.

Fit and finish on the exterior is excellent, same on the interior (I question the carpet and 'crushed velvet' lint brush interior cloth). The NAV system is precise, the stereo very good with lots of power but decent clarity. Mileage so far is great too. The MT/Paddle CVT setup is actually pretty good, but almost demands you manage it manually if you want a sporty drive. Definitely could use more HP, 10-20 more.</TEXT>

Compared to my 2003 Galant ES, this car is a generation better in technology. However, the Galant is better (fun and comfort) to drive and has better fuel economy. Having said that, this car holds its own in terms of performance and comfort. The interior is basic. Cheap looking/feeling fabrics and hard edged plastics. Not a lot of amenities such as an additional power outlet (option), covered storage, arm rests, seat adjustments (has fore/aft & back tilt), coin holder, etc. I have to step back and tell myself that I purchased this car as a beater to drive to work.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I intended to wait until next year, and get the EVO, but after asking the wifey, ... well, you get the picture. :-) First off, the suspension/handling package (on the GTS) is unbelievable. I've driven quite a few cars, and I must say, this is the most impressive part of this car! Word is, it's fairly close to the suspension that will be found in the EVO-X. This car has more available features than any car in it's class (I got them all). The Multi-Communication / Navigation / Sound package is something you'd expect out of a $100k luxury sedan. Looks! Got it in Electric Blue Pearl, and with the GTS package, it turns a lot of heads. WORTH EVERY CENT!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1. GTS package includes 18" wheels, decent tires, nice suspension package! 2. Hard disk based navigation is VERY fast. 3. MusicServer, AUX vid/aud input, DVD player, Bluetooth Cell. 4. CVT w/6 pre-selected ratios using Magnesium paddle shifters = FUN! (Test drove w/manual too, CVT seemed faster.)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Car is fun to Drive, but seems you sit higher then in the new Civic, the navi is a pain to use....and the Lancer still feels tinny. I had a Lancer OZ before my Civic EX Coupe and the civic is more of a solid well built car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have wanted a Mitsubishi for a few years now. I am in college and I had an '04 Mazda3. We had so many problems with it, it was time to get rid of it. I saw the new Lancer and I fell in love with it. I am a red guy, so I saw the commercials with the Rally Red Metallic paint job and I fell in love with the car. I needed the Sun and Sound Package for sure. The navigation was a little too expensive for me, but the car is great without it. Within a week of looking at them, I bought one. I have the only Rally Red Metallic GTS CVT with the Sun and sound package that was available in the state. It was very hard to find, but the salesman did a great job at getting it for me. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the Rockford Fosgate 650 watt 9 speaker sound system. It is absolutely amazing. The bass it puts out is incredible. The seats are very comfortable in my opinion. They are similar to the Lancer Evo of last year, they 'hug' your body. The ride is amazing, it is all racing tuned suspension.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 2008 Lancer is by far the best vehicle I have ever driven! I was one of the lucky few that was able to purchase one of the very first GTS with nav and tech package, sun sound, full load! I have waited ever since I saw the concept online. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who enjoys a great value for the money, and look great doing it! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Proximity key, (for doors and ignition), Rockford fosgate sound system, sirius satellite, navigation (very easy to use), on board computer with calender, barometer, altimeter, lat on long... everything very cool.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Mitsubishi has a winner on their hands with the new 2008 Lancer. Everything from styling to creature comforts has helped raise the bar for this class of sedan. The car is a joy to drive, and the paddle shifters for the CVT transmission on the GTS model allow you to keep the engine in its sweet spot while carving through tight corners. The car is built tight with no squeaks or rattles of any kind. The optional 650 watt Rockford Fosgate audio system packs a punch, especially with the included subwoofer. I would recommend this car without hestitation.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Paddle shifters for the CVT transmission, 650 watt Rockford Fosgate audio system, sharp and edgy exterior styling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Let me just start by saying, I never was a Mitsubishi fan. Most of their cars were small and dull. I actually went to the dealership to test drive a 2007 Mazda CX9. The price wasn't right so I found myself walking off the car lot, but I had to go through the Mitsubishi side of the dealership to get to my car. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a Graphite Gray Pearl Lancer 4dr CVT with paddle shifters and the Sun & Sound Package with Navigation and a 30GB hard drive calling my name. Needless to say I went home that night with the car. And it has been breaking necks every since. This car is pound for pound untouchable by Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, ScionTC, Chevy Colbalt, Acura NSX. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I must say the Titanium Paddle Shifters make the 2.0L 4cyl sing of a mid-engine car. The Rockford Fosgate sound system is just out of this world. The bass alone souds like there is a little man with a jack hammer under your car. I love the Navigation and the Bluetooth interface is outstanding.</FAVORITE>
