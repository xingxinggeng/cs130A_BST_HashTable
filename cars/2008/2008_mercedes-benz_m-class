<TEXT>SUV is more than we expected. Good driving experience, excellent mileage @ 30 mpg highway and 25 in town. Radio and MB tech pkg helpful. HD lights a must, XM radio and NAV work well. Seats comfortable even with MB Tex. Would definitely buy again. No problems so far in this nearly 2-year- old MB Diesel SUV. Bought the extended warranty to 100K miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 17,000 miles, tires developed excessive thumping. After a couple of conversations with the dealer, the dealer, as a favor, agreed to replace the tires, but I was responsible for the four wheel alignment. After 11,000 miles on the second set of tires, the thumping came back. Dealership agreed to check the alignment. According to them, it was within specs. They told me to talk to Michelin Tires. Michelin agreed to replace the tires as a favor. However, they are no longer responsible for wearing of the tires. So at this point, the car having 28,000 miles, the third set of tires has been put on. Mercedes will not accept this problem as their responsibility. HELP! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2006 ML500 for this 2008ML550 because I wanted a few more options such as a hitch and backup camera. My 06ML was wonderful and I had no problems for the three years I owned it! My new 08ML550 is awesome! The extra 80 hp makes it even more powerful (ML500 was fast to me) and the gas mileage is about the same! How do they do that? The quality is top notch and this vehicle is so much fun to drive! Love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd ML starting with a 2000 ML320, then a 01 ML430 and now this awesome 08 ML350. The advancements in technology, comfort, performance and design are amazing. My ML has almost every option including the Bi-Zenon headlights which are incredible in form and function. Even the power tailgate makes life so much more pleasant. Mercedes began the luxury SUV line and has totally raised the bar with the latest ML350. What an awesome vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife had a '06 ML350 and loved the looks and how it drove; however, it was in the shop several times for power liftgate and squeaking rear suspension. Decided to trade in for 2008 with P2 package and never regretted it. The 2008 handles much better, probably due to larger wheels and tires. Bought it in June '08 and overall reliability and build quality has been excellent. The '08 also seemed to have improved on the 7sp transmission as it does not hesitate like the '06. Had opportunity to drive in 3 inches of snow and handled very well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this vehicle new and have been impressed with the handling and the fuel mileage. No one even guesses that this is a diesel when they are riding in it. One of the best features is the locomotive like pull while merging onto the interstate. Absolutely no problems finding diesel and with the large tank you cover a lot of distance. 27mpg in mixed driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's no RR Sport. Not as fun- but 27.4mpg hwy and between 20-22 overall. The gas mileage is great and less carbon emissions. Diesel engine noise is annoying. Porsche will win if they can combine sport and "green" in the new Cayenne!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the ML320 CDI after much consideration vs the BMW X5. It is better than advertised on MPG! I get 24- 28MPG around town and 30-32MPG on the hiway! Minimum 600 - 700 miles per tankfull! Plenty of power and torque that no gas engine can match! No black smoke and no noise! Americans should re-educate themselves about diesel! No hybrid can match the power and range - period. It is way ahead of any competitor in this range and I am 100% satisfied and as a previous Mercedes Benz owner - this the best I ever had! </TEXT>

<TEXT>My ML550 has the power to scare squirrels on trees a quarter mile away. I love the take off speed. The stereo is very rich and nice. I never dreamed that satellite radio would be so addictive. The seats are seductive in their contours. While the nav has quite a few limits, such as the joystick and the lack of new roads, it serves it purpose well and has a much nicer voice than the 2006 edition. While road noise is more pronounced then the E class, it is much quieter in the ML than in many other cars. The car is just fun to drive. I really like at lights when someone pulls the other lane expecting to blow past the bloated SUV only to be mistaken.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ive had the ML-350 for 4 weeks now.The performance is great. Quick,solid,smooth shifting. The steering is very sensitive and I tended to oversteer until I got used to it. I think much more responsive than my Jag XJ-8. The ML-350 has so many bells and whistles it takes time to learn them but once you do it seems easy. I was actually happy with the non leather seats. I've had trouble in the past with leather. Seat adjustment is wonderful. I am 6-4 and my wife is 5-3 so you can imagine what kind of workout the seat motors get. Great car as you would expect</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd MBZ, coming from an E- Class, I thought I would give the ML350 a shot, after reading so many good reviews here. I must say, they are true. This is really a great vehicle. The Alpine Rain color is hardly seen here in NY and love it, with the Ash interior. I think MBZ should have more standard features though.. you have to pay for everything! My buddy's KIA came with bluetooth, but MBZ wanted $400 for it. I really have nothing to complain about. Rides excellent and looks even better. Much better than previous shape.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Solid as a rock. Turns on a dime. As far as I'm concerned this SUV is the most car for the money. Two large teenagers can sit in the back seat without any complaints. If you need extra space for traveling get a trailer hitch for the back and a box that will easily carry 4 sets of golf bags. I have now bought three 350ML's. I truly think they're the best car for the money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Sold my '03 BMW X5 and purchased my ML 320CDI in Jan '08. I was torn between the Mercedes and the new BMW X5 but chose the ML based on good looks, power and fun to drive. I find I just want to get in the car and drive. The SUV is smooth, quiet, luxurious and most of all great fun to drive. Terrific sound system. Average 22 mpg combined city/highway. No problems since I purchased it. Would highly recommend.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had ML350 for 1-1/2 weeks now. Very impressive, sylish, drives very well. Mercedes clearly pays attention to detail. I am replacing an Acura MDX which I liked very much. ML 350 has the pickup necessary for Dallas area freeways. It is very quiet inside. While the toys (voice recognition, touch screen, nav system) are not as sophisticated as the Acura, the comfort and safety features equal or exceed the MDX. The resolution of the rear camera is outstanding. The Acura has a few more storage areas which I miss, but the power liftgate on the Mercedes is a very owner friendly feature I am still getting used to the shifing lever. It is unlike anything I've had before. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When I had to look for an SUV to replace my 05 Range Rover, I wanted something smaller and hopefully with a bit better fuel economy. I had already leased a BMW X5 and didn't really love it-it was very heavy and "trucky". The Lexus R was sort of cheap feeling and I believe if you buy a Lexus or Infiniti, you are paying for the badge not the quality. I thought I would miss the luxury of the Rover, but from the moment I p/u my car I have not looked back. It handles beautifully, feels more like a car, much better mileage already w/o breaking in. The only thing better on the Rover was the navigation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>As others,looked at RX250,X5,and ML. Came to MB ML in looking for SUV with better than average MPG. Diesel won me over and liked exterior above others. As some have noted, nav (need touch screen, improve intuitive flow) and signal stem (proximity to cruise control) need updating/improvement. MB could use better value packaging like Lexus. Start w/ P2 and tailor to need. Downshifting non-issue with slight and logical modification of driving habit. Very pleased with choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As the owner of three ML's since 1998, currently a 2005 Special Edition, I went into my local dealer today to test drive a new one. I love the exterior styling and wanted to love the interior but was very disappointed by everything. The gearshift on the steering column - what were they thinking? And the MBTec standard fake leather is ridiculous on a supposed luxury car. Inside much cheaper looking overall. So my love affair with MLs is coming to an end. My heart is considering buying the one I have now, but my head is telling my to give serious consideration to the Acura MDX I test drove yesterday - don't care much for the look but it's all around higher rated and a better value. I'm sad.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the car for couple of months now. Great power under the hood - the turbo really makes a difference. The fuel economy is excellent. Once you get the hang of it you can get about 32MPG highway and about 20 city - I get about 25-26MPG for 50-50 city/highway. Not bad for an SUV with this size an power. Can't mention enough about the torque! All in all the best SUV I have driven (compared to Lexus, BMW models). Have taken it to the mountains - starts with ease and pure pleasure to drive up hill - gasoline engines are no match to the power!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Coming from two BMW's (most recent being a newer model 7 series), I was going back and forth between the X5 and ML. I decided to go with the ML since the value was much greater and I like the ML design better. Also, the standard seats on the X5 were uncomfortable. Although I am accustomed to a smooth ride, I found the ML to drive very well especially considering it's an SUV. I also like how the transmission shifs so smooth. I bought the ML 350 with premium 2 pkg, parktronic, Ipod and running boards. Unlike the review from spicoli on 3/17/2008, I do have Xenon headlights, rain sensing, power tailgate, driver/passenger memory seats and rear climate control and many other cool features. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased an 06 ML500 to replace my 2001 ML430. Loved it so much I just purchased a 2008 ML550. The motor is fantastic. The 550 is so smooth and fast, it blows away the 500 engine. Heated and cooled front seats, air suspension, and 19" AMG rims make the car the ultimate long distance cruiser. Handles the Canadian winter with no problem, and takes us skiing every weekend in style with heated rear seats for the kids. As my 4th ML since 1999, this one can't be beat. We plan to keep the ML500 and ML550 for a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car! I recently bought a 2008 Limited Edition M350 and it's the first SUV I've owned, having previously owned 4-door luxury sedans. The car is a vast improvement over previous models. The newly designed exterior is sleek rather than boxy, interior is luxurious yet practical, and handling is responsive but not truck-like. The interior and ride are more like a luxury sedan than a work- horse vehicle, though I got the car to perform in the snow. It hasn't snowed since I got the car so I can't comment on that aspect of its performance, but I'm sure I won't be disappointed since previously I owned a rear-wheel drive car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When I had to look for an SUV to replace my 05 Range Rover, I wanted something smaller and hopefully with a bit better fuel economy. I had already leased a BMW X5 and didn't really love it-it was very heavy and "trucky". The Lexus R was sort of cheap feeling and I believe if you buy a Lexus or Infiniti, you are paying for the badge not the quality. I thought I would miss the luxury of the Rover, but from the moment I p/u my car I have not looked back. It handles beautifully, feels more like a car, much better mileage already w/o breaking in. The only thing better on the Rover was the navigation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>As others,looked at RX250,X5,and ML. Came to MB ML in looking for SUV with better than average MPG. Diesel won me over and liked exterior above others. As some have noted, nav (need touch screen, improve intuitive flow) and signal stem (proximity to cruise control) need updating/improvement. MB could use better value packaging like Lexus. Start w/ P2 and tailor to need. Downshifting non-issue with slight and logical modification of driving habit. Very pleased with choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As the owner of three ML's since 1998, currently a 2005 Special Edition, I went into my local dealer today to test drive a new one. I love the exterior styling and wanted to love the interior but was very disappointed by everything. The gearshift on the steering column - what were they thinking? And the MBTec standard fake leather is ridiculous on a supposed luxury car. Inside much cheaper looking overall. So my love affair with MLs is coming to an end. My heart is considering buying the one I have now, but my head is telling my to give serious consideration to the Acura MDX I test drove yesterday - don't care much for the look but it's all around higher rated and a better value. I'm sad.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the car for couple of months now. Great power under the hood - the turbo really makes a difference. The fuel economy is excellent. Once you get the hang of it you can get about 32MPG highway and about 20 city - I get about 25-26MPG for 50-50 city/highway. Not bad for an SUV with this size an power. Can't mention enough about the torque! All in all the best SUV I have driven (compared to Lexus, BMW models). Have taken it to the mountains - starts with ease and pure pleasure to drive up hill - gasoline engines are no match to the power!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Coming from two BMW's (most recent being a newer model 7 series), I was going back and forth between the X5 and ML. I decided to go with the ML since the value was much greater and I like the ML design better. Also, the standard seats on the X5 were uncomfortable. Although I am accustomed to a smooth ride, I found the ML to drive very well especially considering it's an SUV. I also like how the transmission shifs so smooth. I bought the ML 350 with premium 2 pkg, parktronic, Ipod and running boards.

My car has so far exceeded all my expectation in terms of performance and quality. The tremendous diesel power propels the car into any traffic when needed. But mostly I like driving very gently and the car rewards me with 30 miles on highways (when I am really gentle) and 23 miles in local/highway (40/60) mix on average. Its creature comfort is well designed and well executed. The car feels like a marble rolling on glass pane in highways.

The SUV only has 101 miles however we have already received a warning message indicating a problem with the rear tail light. The dealership wants me to bring it back in however they are over 40 miles from my house and this vehicle is leased. Kind of soured me on the whole "new car" experience. So far we like the SUV and it has a lot of power, especially compared to my X5 which was terribly slow. I will follow back with a reliability report and how this issue is handled by MBUSA.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great SUV all-around, but the diesel clinched it for me. It just makes so much sense for trucks and SUVs. Yes, it's a hair louder than a gas engine under acceleration (which is excellent, by the way, because of all that torque). But cruising is very quiet, and there's absolutely no smoke or odor, ever. Bottom line: you get the space and utility you need at a thrifty 26 mpg. Plus, you can feel good about being green with the smaller carbon footprint. Really, you've got to try one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am so glad we'd got this SUV. The Mercedes Benz ML550 has been very good to our family so far. I love everything about and I promise if you take it for a test drive you will love it too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th ML by Mercedes. This is a real Mercedes-Benz compared to the 3 other MLs I owned. I think it is better in every way. The interior is the biggest upgrade. I like the 10th anniversay features, special leather, badges, exterior headlites, and tail lites.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is just perfect all around. The engine is out of this world, the best I ever own, responsive and gas consumption better than I expected. I had BMW X5 2001 nothing to compare and then my LEXUS LX 470 2004 the worst car I had. I am so glad that I got the ML550 </TEXT>

<TEXT>Too new to be totally fair with this vehicle, just bought it October 18. The SUV only has 101 miles however we have already received a warning message indicating a problem with the rear tail light. The dealership wants me to bring it back in however they are over 40 miles from my house and this vehicle is leased. Kind of soured me on the whole "new car" experience. So far we like the SUV and it has a lot of power, especially compared to my X5 which was terribly slow. I will follow back with a reliability report and how this issue is handled by MBUSA.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Radio sound and performance. Plenty of power from 3.5L</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great SUV all-around, but the diesel clinched it for me. It just makes so much sense for trucks and SUVs. Yes, it's a hair louder than a gas engine under acceleration (which is excellent, by the way, because of all that torque). But cruising is very quiet, and there's absolutely no smoke or odor, ever. Bottom line: you get the space and utility you need at a thrifty 26 mpg. Plus, you can feel good about being green with the smaller carbon footprint. Really, you've got to try one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Diesel motor, 7-speed transmission, navigation system, and I know it's safe.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great fit and finish. Fast 0-60 mph 4.4 sec. Rides like it is on rails. Handles like my M5. Solid with great corning on the twisting roads. Great seats and Harmon Kardon sounds system. Passing and power unlimited.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine fantastic with usable torque and horsepower at low and high rpm. The Nappa Leather is wonderful. The cargo management system is fantastic, things never slide around when traveling fast.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Lexus has no chance on this one, for the time being, as we did consider the GX 470 and many other SUVs. Standard equipment on this car is unbelievable and the ride is irreplaceable. Great job MB </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD, great seating and instrument panel, interface with phone, much improved appearance</FAVORITE>
