<TEXT>When gas prices started rising we decided to buy an economy car. The Aveo was advertised at getting app. 34 mpg. This car is not what we expected. It has a slow jumpy start until it warms up, it only gets 17 to 18 mpg. The accelerator acts like its stuck wide open when it is started for the first time in the mornings. I have been told by the dealer that the engine is performing the way it was designed to.Most of my driving is to and from work, which is a 40 mile round trip. The gas mileage does not vary if my driving is on the highway or in town with a lot of starts and stops.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was disappointed in buying the 2008 Aveo. The car was defective with no parking light, driving panel lights and shifter indicator light. The dealership closed that day and I was pressured into buying the car. I drove the car not feeling safe in it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The good feature is the front left driver side door. You will need a key to lock the door from outside it will not lock from inside.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought a used Aveo 5 with 5speed. I earlier had bought a new intro Aveo in 2004. I was never quite happy with the mileage. I aso found the shifter really mushy and it really needed an armrest. Those issues are fixed in the 2008. I get 37+ on the highway (70-75mph) and the old one would only get 33 if you babied it at <65mph. The shifter is much improved, it now has an armrest an the handling is much tighter. I gave up A/C to get a cheap purchase price but haven't missed A/C so far. I still am concerned about the reported troublesome timing belt but will just plan on 50K replacement. All-in-all I find the Aveo 5 very fine for my needs- inexpensive-fun to drive- efficient.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Aveo, but am not excited about my fuel consumption. I live in Canada and am supposed to get up to 49 mpg and I average 36mpg. I am guessing now that it could have something to do with my throttle body as it is presently in the shop being replaced. On Friday my service engine light came on, I had been noticing a choppy feeling in the car and thought it wasn't getting its fuel properly for some time now but tried to explain it off for something else. When the light came on I had no other choice than to except my first assumption. Hopefully this change will improve my gas mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfy seats have taken a 7 hr trip and was pleasantly surprised that I did not have a sore butt after the trip. Love the smoothness of the stick shift. And the fact that I have to use key to lock the driver door is great, haven't locked my keys in the car once.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Aveo hatchback. My 1st was a 2004 (1st year production). It was the automatic and I learned that to get the most out of this vehicle, I should have gotten the 5-speed. I only had this car for 1 year as I traded it on a Honda Element. I regretted it from day one. Anyway, last year (2008) I purchased another Aveo5 LS 5-speed new for $12,000 "out-the-door". It was equipped with factory cruise control and was pinstriped! I now have almost 25,000 miles on it and it still is a great car! I get an honest 35 MPG without the air on and 32 with the air on. I have noticed that on the highway I only get 30 MPG when the cruise is set to 72 MPH. Great car..minor issues covered by warranty.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great gas mileage, very comfortable (I'm 6', 245 lbs.), very solid, no rattles, original tires still good at 24,000 miles, very reliable, easy oil change, GET THE 5-SPEED and the car becomes FUN. The auto tranny slows response. Great headlights, tracks well, easy to maneuver.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was searching for a used car, well a man I know buys wrecked cars and fixes them up, I happened to see this lil 08 Aveo, and bought it on the spot, the front bumper is cracked but other than that it looks great, I drive alot because I am a grandma and the Aveo gets great mpg. The check engine light was flickering and the mechanic said it just needed an o2 sensor, not bad for 48000 miles runs and drives like new, o and the bumper is only 130.00 online!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great little car for people who drive a lot. It is comfortable and reliable and the gas price is excellent especially if you get the federal reimbursement rate. I am having trouble with the front tires wearing unevenly on the outsides. Just be aware that I have 28,000 miles on this car and bought it brand new with 13 miles. I am on the second set of tires and will be needing new ones to pass state inspection. Another Oveo driver I know has the same problem also. The tires are rotated and balanced appropriately. Just be aware you may need tires yearly. I have not had any other problem with the car besides this. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The back seats folding up against the front for extra room. The seats have scotch guard so spills are easy to clean. The gas mileage is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm a college student and this is definitely great for that. I bought it new. Once I got an oil change and rotated the tires it drove like a dream. It survived a harsh winter and still holds up. You might need better tires for the snow. I wish the speaker system was a bit better. Also there's a design flaw that causes the windshield to whistle from an air pocket when I drive on the highway. Also the check engine light is on and I've only had the car for a year. The car is really roomy despite its outward appearance. It's definitely a good car. Oh yeah, amazing gas mileage! Saves me money!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely loved this car at first. It was the first car I had ever bought in which I picked it out and everything. It was the perfect color-- blue my favorite! And great gas mileage, I got 35 mpgs which was great for commuting to school... But within 5 days I had to take it back to the dealer for the sensors coming on and the gas gauge not working. I also have had two problems with the "shift-lock release" first the solenoid was replaced then, last week, the whole shifting column! I have had the car less than a year! Before this, I owned a Toyota and a Ford and I was never disappointed and now I know I never should have gotten a Chevy aveo. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife & I love the car even after downsizing from a mid-size auto. I was shocked when I was told about the car requires a 400.00 tune-up, coolant change every 36000 miles and a new timing belt after 60000. Dealer never mention that at the time of sale!!! Other than those items the auto is nice for the $$$$$$ </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased this LS with air and auto for $9,340. We have been looking at Aveos since they came out. We love the way they sit. They sit high, so you don't have to fall into the seat and clamber out. The mpg is disappointing so far. Just 22 mpg city. I figure I can afford at least $10,000 worth of gasoline before I reach the price of a hybrid. I don't think that the hybrids would ever match the overall economy. We really do like this car. It could be a little wider for large people though, and I don't understand why little cars don't have arm rests for both front seats, or one that is big enough for both people. Right now, I would say go for the best priced non hybrid to save the most money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>29,000 miles and doing exactly what is expected of it, with no issues. Auto averages 29 mpg in WV terrain. The door does lock without the key! Just lock the door then hold out on the door handle when you shut-it and it'll stay locked. A little word of advice for those of you who are planning on owning for a good while. Keep the pil changed and use good quality oil. The oil pick-up tubes in these engines are very small and will sludge-up creating a blow-by which will cause the exhaust to smoke and loss of oil, power, and potential over heating, and small engines don't like being overheated.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If money were no object, some relatively minor improvments would make the Aveo a contender. So, for the price paid ($10,400 brand new off the lot!), this car was a fantastic deal. Since new, and now with 11,000 miles, only two minor problems: a tire pressure sensor went on one wheel. No biggie. This was repaired by the dealer with no issues. Developed a front-end shudder due to improper lug torque on both front wheels. Again, an easy fix. Design and build quality is excellent. Seams are even and tight. Not a squeak or rattle has developed. Motor remains perky and trouble-free (easy starts, no stalls). There is a buzz in the gas pedal over 60 mph, but have learned to deal with it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Peppy performance (but affects economy). Classy, roomy interior. Excellent seating. Great sound system. Roomy trunk. Includes "upscale" features (cabin filter, oil and tire monitoring systems). Dependable to date and virtually hassle-free. Excellent warranty includes 5 years road-side maintenance.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted to write this review due to the fact that people have complained about this lovely car a lot. I got a 08 Chevy Aveo because I needed something better for my job and this car fit perfectly. No it doesn't have the power of a Corvette but if I wanted the power of a Corvette I would have bought one! This car has been getting me from point A to point be and this is a nice family car but sporty looking too!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After paying almost $200 for a tank of gas in my Suburban, I decided it was time to make a change! I wanted a "no frills" car, didn't even know if they made such a thing! When I saw the Aveo5, it was exactly what I was looking for! After the initial shock of switching from a Suburban to this car, I was in love! Drove 2,000 miles the first month just because it is so fun to drive! My monthly payment is less than the cost of one tank of gas in my Suburban! I did have a stereo installed. Couldn't deal with AM/FM...but other than that, I'm as thrilled as can be with my car. Her name is "No Frill Lil"....very basic, but an awesome drive!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the fact that the interior is so spacious. You do not feel like you are in a tiny car! Also love the split, fold down rear seats! Also like the fact that you have to use the key to lock the drivers side door! No locked keys in the car this way!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Based on other reviews I've read, it seems to me that the people who are most dissatisfied with this car are those who expect to get a Corvette or a Cadillac for the Aveo's price. After my test drive, I was really quite impressed. It's obviously no Corvette, but it accelerates better than I expected. The engine is smooth and the 5 speed transmission is easy to drive. I am 6' tall. I have plenty of head & leg room in both the driver and passenger seats. The seats are firm, but comfortable. I've driven the Aveo for an hour on the highway several times with no comfort problems. The hatchback holds tons of stuff. Taken it to the hardware store and Costco and were able to haul everything we needed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Price, can't beat this car for the money. Great gas mileage getting about 27 in the city. Surprisingly nice stereo. 5 speed is easy to drive with good clutch feel. Easy to fit into tight parking spots.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car was much better than I even expected! It has great power for only a 4 cylinder engine. That is saying a lot. Has chrome areas, built much better than the Chevys I have had in the past which include a Cavalier and a Lumina. I have a sunroof, spoiler, makes it sporty yet still a family car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car for the money. Honest! We've got the manual loaded with the sunroof/moonroof. Not the most fun car I've ever bought but a great one. I needed a cheap car that got good gas mileage. I wanted a hybrid but figured that extra $8-13 grand would buy a lot of gas at $4 a gallon. I've owned this for 10 months (took in once for a sensor, fixed that day) and only have 7,500 miles. If you drive it gently (Yeh, not my style either) you'll get the estimated mileage or slightly better. I'll never call this a "fun" ride, but I'll always call it a smart ride. Need more fun, room, or "style", then spend the money. Need around 200 or-less miles a week and real economy, give an Aveo a look.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great around town and not afraid of it on the highway. Nice trunk for lil' thing. Jack for my IPOD nice, too (Just got my first IPOD at 37 years old).</FAVORITE>

I couldn't be more pleased with the way it handles, reliability, gas mileage and appearance. I have received numerous compliments on it. I can't understand why I don't see more of them on the road and why they are advertised very little. I would recommend this car to anybody and in fact have done so. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was planning to buy a Toyota Yaris but stopped to look at the Aveo and got it instead. I liked the 4 door and the price was thousands less. I got the 5 speed and wish I had the auto. I added cruise control and use the car for hiway driving. I can get 40mpg on long distances, but generally average about 36mpg. Worst thing is the sloppy shifter and hard seats. Lots of best things: Easier to get in & out of than my Buick, 4 doors, great mpg, easy to park and do u-turns, very simple interior controls.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car three weeks ago and I havent looked back. I bought the Value Special stickered for $10,700. I paid $7700. There is no car anywhere close to this price that performs this well. I don't feel buying this car loaded is a smart deal at $14,500. But at $11K to $8K you cant go wrong. Rides nice. front seats fit me great. Great 5 speed transmission. Shifts smooth. Good fit and well I think it is fun to drive. I drive 300 miles a week for work and spend around $36 to $38 in gas a week. Payments are low, gas bills are low. What is not to like. Sure there are nicer cars out there but at twice the price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good front seats. Nice ride, fun to drive. Good fit. No leaks. No rattles or squeeks. Good tilt wheel. Real window defroster works good and fast. Nice fabric covering on seats. Good headlight, nice and bright. Smooth steering and handling. Very responsive for a small car. Good tight turning radius. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love it. I purchased an Aveo for a work/travel car and price and fuel economy made me take a look at it. So far I am extremely impressed. It won't win many races, but is peppy. It is capable of getting more mpgs than 33mpg/gallon. A great value, but is realy a basic car. If you want good value and basic transportation you cant beat it.

As of now I only average 18 mpg, but it's brand new. After I break it in I hope to average at least 24 mpg. Otherwise they'll need to be more honest about the actual mileage.</TEXT>

I also have a Hyundai Accent hatchback SE 2007 which is lemon lawed and being bought back. I would like to see this car with 4 disc breaks rather then 2 but what can you do. I would also like a different color opt for inter leather (black). This is a opt for 2009. I did a few things with this car to make it stand out.

<TEXT>I was looking for a car with good gas mileage and enough room inside for my 12 year old son who is now 5'11 1/2" tall. He needs room to grow over the next 3-4 years of anticipated ownership and is supposed to end up about 6'6" tall! We checked out a variety of cars in the similar class, with fuel efficiency & cabin size being the #1 priorities. Not only does the Aveo offer ample headroom and decent leg space for a compact car, but it's paying for itself! The reduced insurance cost, improved gas mileage and decent styling led us to this car. Our former car was an Xterra, and there is as much interior cabin space in this tiny Aveo as we had before - but more then twice the MPG's.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have seen just a few reviews that dont like the Aveo. I have had mine six months and some of the complaints are hard to understand. Gas mileage and room are the two that bother me most. Only a few have written but I would like to say I get 36 to 41+ driving country roads and some city. No highway. I am 6 ft 1 in tall weigh 265 pounds and it is more room than I need. My nephew is 6 ft 5 in tall and he has no problem at all. I have 7000+ miles on my car and I love it. So all I can say is try it out make your own decision. It is by far the least inexpensive. I paid $8998 with air. Super car to me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been driving this car for 3 months now. I average 22.5 MPG in mostly suburban driving, with a roundtrip distance to work of 20 miles each day. I also use it to deliver papers in every morning, which takes about 30 minutes. I use to do the same routine in a Honda Civic which had a larger engine and got 30 MPG. So I am very disapointed with the fuel economy. Even open road driving you can watch that gas gauge visibly drop. You cannot lock the driver side door except by using the key - this is a pain when you have bundles to carry and/or its raining.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Yellow exterior stands out and looks good - I wanted the copper color but they don't produce many of those so I had to settle for yellow. I like the hatchback - plenty of head and leg room in front, although not much cargo capacity. Car drives well out on the road, but has poor control in cornering</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I researched everything under $20k. My Aveo is loaded with everything they had and was still sub $15k. What a great car. Small enough to be economical, heavy enough to ride smoothly and quietly. I'm 6'0 275 lbs. Best fit of any car smaller than Chevy Malibu. If you're looking for zoom-zoom, this is not for you. If you want a comfy ride, low road and engine noise, plenty of interior room, upscale accessories and good mileage (I avg. 32) all at a great price, then the Aveo is your ride. Much better than Yaris, Scion, Versa, Fit. There are some bad reviews out there, but that's true with any car. I have been a Toyota believer for 30 yrs. The Aveo beats every other small car hands down!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very comfortable, quiet ride; like much bigger car. Love the sunroof, love the cruise, good a/c, good stereo/CD/mp3. Nice, tight 5 spd manual. Reminds me of the MG Midget convertible I had in college. Loved that one, too. Nice bright blue. Euro styling draws interest. I look forward to driving again</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car for the gas mileage. I drive at least 30 miles a day in my commute to work 6 days a week. Supposedly it gets 33 mpg highway. I drive the express lanes at 60 mph every day with 2 to 3 miles of my commute on surface streets. I am getting between 22 to 24 mpg consistently. I am very disappointed. My son is 6 foot tall and even with the seat all the way back his legs are almost resting on the steering wheel. It comes with an arm rest which is so far back in the seat it barely reaches my hip and is so low that I can only rest my wrist on it if I reach behind me. As far as driving goes it is easy to drive. I have to fill up every 4 days. My other car went 1 1/2 weeks per fill up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I would recommend this car to others based on initial driving. It has exceeded my expectations, which were for a small, simple, economical car. First tank of gas off the dealer's lot in 60/40 highway/city driving for 2 different drivers yielded 32.8 mpg. Haven't owned it long enough to rate build and reliability. For an economy car, I find the engine performance more than adequate, although not fast. 65mph comes in at just under 3000rpm. Ride is comfortable for a small car. Like the forward dash and high ceilings, which create greater interior room. Initially looked for used, but price of a new (with A/C installed by dealer) came in within budget.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the kind of car that these manufacturers are producing. Good on gas, drives like a big car, fun to drive, most specially, very practical. For a single mom like me, there is no car in the market that is comparable with the quality, prize for your money and so far no major problem. I just follow the maintenance schedule and voila, the car just simply perform and does its job. I will highly recommend this as a good buy </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned about 6 months, 6000+ miles. Was impressed when I bought and even more so now. Fit and finish inside and out is still excellent. No new noise or vibrations. Still tight and solid. I am 6 ft 1 in tall weigh 265 lbs. I am very comfortable. The ride is super for such a small cheap (cost not build) car. Was getting 39 to 41 mpg driving very conservitive. Tried driving more agressive and still got 37 mpg. This is with some city more country driving with stops. No highway. Based only on my experence it is the best small car I have ever owned. Have had Toyota, Honda, Ford, Mazda. Am 52 years old. Had a lot of cars. I hope everyone finds a car they like as much as I do this one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a car enthusiast who wanted a car that was low in price but would be fun to drive .This car has more than exceeded expectations The car we bought is bright blue , has manual tranny , roll up windows , six speaker upgraded CD radio , optional 15 inch aluminum wheels. Upgrades after purchase include hood protector, custom side moulding, LED tail light bulbs. A local performance shop fabricated a straight thru flowmaster muffler and pipe that bolted onto the original exhaust to give car a bit of a growl and more get up and go. My wife refers to the Aveo as a Flintstones Pedal Car" because it is so small and unadorned with frills. I just love it , best car I have ever owned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Aveo is large on the inside and has a high roof line so my head does not scrape the roof getting in and out. A switch can turn off inside lights even with door open. Great visibility, firm suspension, roll up windows, excellent stereo, top post battery. Simplicity at it's best and fun!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you are looking for a great quality affordable car. The Aveo LS Sedan is the best! The gas mileage for me is 33hwy and 27city. It is so affordable and for it to cost so low it really looks nice from the inside out. The design of the Euro lights to the cool sound of the six Speakers built inside. The seats are pure comfort and the Woodgrain adds a very nice touch. If you do lots of traveling then you would really want to consider this pick. Its drives very smooth and you do not hear much outside noise. This is my first time owning an American car, and the way I see it if you pick the Aveo you will forever be a Chevy fan!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great design. It has a nice sporty look. Very happy to have a MP3/Ipod jack & six speakers built in. Smooth ride, and a quiet engine. Great gas mileage! Great quality vehicle! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is one fine small car. Interior comfort and quility is more than expected for a car this size. The exterior is great to me. I love it. Now as to mileage going back and forth to work and driving around, I have gotten over 40 miles to a gallon. I do drive easy but still I think for the cost there is no comparision to other cars in class. This is by far better. I know others would not be better on mileage than this one I own. Best small car I have owned. I think for price I paid and mileage I get this is the cheapest to own don't care how you compute it. Love this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a 5 door hatch in the LS trim in March of 2008. Did lots of research on the car and found it to be as advertised. Gas mileage is roughly 30 on the highway and about 25 city. Not quite as good as I would expect in a vehicle of this size. Aerodynamics are questionable as the vehicle is boxy and this probably leads to some loss of mileage. I took the car on a trip to a surrounding state and found that it did surprisingly well on the highways, even on a very windy day. Cruise control would be a nice addition for higway driving. The interior is surprisingly roomy and 4 people can be fairly comfortable for short hops. This is an excellent commuter car and has some nice features.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my 2008 Aveo that I purchased in aug 2007 however I have had some problems with it. Not once but twice the struts had to be changed (the same side). And just a month ago it was in the shop for 3 weeks because something happened to my transmission. Now that it is fixed and it is running okay I love it. I get great gas mileage and I love that it has 4 doors. Great for families with a 5 year old like me and still is somewhat sporty. Love the spoiler.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With negotiation, rebates and GM card earnings,paid $11,133 for all-option car listing at $17,255. City mileage 26-30mpg;no highway trips yet. I love this little car for what we have been using it for. It is comfortable, and although not a high performer, has plenty of zip for city and highway driving. I am impressed with the build quality,'though carpeting is not dense. Winter mats are $80 for the set, are a custom fit and have good water retention edges. Rear seat a little tight, but rarely used. Mud flaps offer great protection. Modest steering vibration (Engine idle feedback), but no worse than Honda Civic Hybrid. Our other cars are a newer Suburban and Tahoe, Corvette and Ford GT. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Upgraded radio/CD/sound system is great. Leatherette interior is nice;should hold up according to other reviews I've read-would prefer black to the light tan, but not offered. Steering wheel controls nice, but not lit at night. Cost/warranty was unbelievable-couldn't buy a Harley for this price!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the Special Value package to be able to park my F150 for the daily commute (90 mi round trip). Bought it for just under $7700 and have been very pleased with it so far. Gas mileage averaging about 29, but that is due to either in-town driving, or 75 MPH highway, very little in between. Can live without AC, will just drive the truck when it's too hot. No big deal on the cheapo radio, easily remedied for $150. Has a few things I wasn't expecting for such a low priced car. Serving its purpose wonderfully, and saving more than its cost in gas as compared to driving my truck! Plus a 100,000 mile drivetrain warranty. Almost forgot how much fun a little 5 speed can be!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car is much more than expected. Must take into account cost and type of vehicle. All things considered it is a 10 in my book.Milege is better than rated 34 some city and more rural driving no highway. Have to give ten on mileage gets better than rated. Fit and trim inside and out is excellent. Better than other big name small cars I have owned. So far it is the best small car I have owned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is definately the lest expensive new car on the market I could find, and one with excellent gas mileage. This car has allowed me to justify easily the purchase of a new car for driving back anf forth to work, about 23 miles one way. With GM's excellent warrantee, better than Honda FIT's and other similar vehicles, I don't have to worry about paying for a tow truck if it breaks down, or paying for a loaner while it sets in a garage, this is part of the warrantee. I don't have to worry about those costly budget busting repairs to a used car, all covered under warrantee. I enjoy the ride especially when I'm getting between 33 and 38 mpg, averaging 36 mpg! Purchased for under $10,000 !</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the hatchback feature with the folding rear seats. The heater puts oout hot air quickly and disperses it to the rear passenger area well. Rear wiper and defrost standard along with front and side airbags for driver and passenger. Gas savings the first month more than made my payment.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did my research on this vehicle before I purchased, so I knew what to expect. Great value for the money. I love the car, its lots of fun to drive and I highly recommend it. In regards to fuel economy, oddly the DOT estimates rate this car as 34mpg/24mpg. I have gotten 37 mpg highway and 33 mpg in mixed driving with the 5 speed manual transmission during the winter. I expect to get even better gas mileage during the warmer months. To maximize fuel economy, I would suggest to keep the tachometer at around 1,200-1,500 rpms when shifting gears, and accelerate smoothly, no jack rabbit starts. During highway driving, try to keep the speed between 55 and 60 mph and the tach around 2500 rpms. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tilt steering, driver side lumbar seat support, great styling (looks like the Scion XA), tire pressure monitoring system. Comfort, handling and acceleration was fine for me. You have to pace yourself. Its not a race car! The seats were very comfortable and the car has a great solid "large car" feel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have owned for about a month. Am getting 35+miles to the gallon back and forth to work and around. Rural driving not city not highway. Has been super so far. Truth will be down the road. So far it has been everthing I had hoped for. Better than rated mileage I drive very conservative). Much better fit and finish interior and exterior than 2003 Corrlla that I had. Mileage is better also driving the same way. Was Ford and Toyota person. If keeps going like it is I will stay with GM.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought a bare bones that was advertised on the newspaper. The offer included an extra $1K just by showing up on Dec/24th before 2pm, so I did. It took some time and patience to make the dealer agree, after all I was taking a big deal. Bottom line, $6K + tax, fees, brand new w/ 3mi on the ODO. My "other" car is an Audi S4, so for a daily commuter (100mi/day) the Aveo is impressive, gas savings are huge, build quality is better than expected, suspension is soft and body roll is moderate. Don't try to smoke anybody, unless you use your moving momentum. Brakes are quite good also. This is my 1st "Domestic" car and so far I'm very and impressed and pleased.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's a manual, it's simple and not a bad or weird to look at. Suspension is soft and pot holes and bumpy roads are easy (big difference than Audi's sport susp + low profile 18"), plenty of storage and quite roomy. Heater is cappable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I went into my local Chevrolet dealer looking for a good used car, ended up buying the 2008 Chevy Aveo. Bottom line price. The actual mileage I get on the highway is not what was stated on the sticker, but all things considered I only have 1k miles on it. Not quite broken in yet. Best mileage 32.47. Not bad for a car I payed $7499.00. Mine is the base model. I highly recommend if you are going to commute which I drive 100 miles a day, get cruise control. I have cruise control on order and send it to chevy tomorrow to get it installed. Small on the outside large on the inside. I am a 5'11" 240lbs. I have enough room in it. Plenty of visual all the way around the car as so I can merge easily.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Price. The driver side arm rest, clever feature for the commuter. Zippy, easy to drive and park. Fold down seats allows for more cargo room, nice. Rear window wiper blade, nice. Interior has been thought out nicely for such an inexpensive car. Very happy with it all around.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Due to a lengthy commute, I began to look at the economy segment of the auto world. Really like the look of the redesigned Aveo sedan, so I took a test drive at the closest Chevy dealer. Wow, was I caught off guard with this little guy. The one I drove was an 08 LT bright red, with pretty much all the bells and whistles. Leatherette interior (very nice), moonroof (power), auto trans, steering wheel controls, etc etc. Very smooth ride with solid acceleration. Took it out on the highway, and had no problems whatsoever in keeping up. Cabin feels very upscale and roomy. Lots to like on this one, and it has a safe feel to it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the bare-bones "loss leader" car that the dealers advertise as "2008 Aveos for $7995!" The price was great, given that we are willing to do without A/C in an around-town car, and prefer the manual 5 speed. The promotional price was way better then the Edmunds invoice or TMV price, even after the dealer's add-on $275 "title fees." We also had to fight to not pay for other dealer add- ons. As expected, this car feels quite underpowered and is noisy, but overall we got more than we expected. The gas mileage is really not as great as everyone says, and is less than the old Escort we traded in. I don't know why it is low, but we can buy a lot of gas with the savings compared to a Yaris.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior width side-to-side, and rear leg-room. Split fold-down rear seat. Tire low-pressure warning using radio telemetry. 4 doors for this price. A tachometer. The speedometer is in front of the driver (unlike Yaris). Side airbags. </FAVORITE>
