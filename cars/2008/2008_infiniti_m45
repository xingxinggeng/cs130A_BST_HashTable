<TEXT>Love the car but I have a clunking noise coming from the rear of the car. Infiniti knows about this & it's been with the M series since 2006. They say its "unfixable". WHAT??? I am very displeased with the way Infiniti is handling this problem and plan to take it to the fullest, if it should come to that.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>lane change warning, voice activated nav system, in cruise control the auto pacing is great, sound system is great seats are very comfortable, dash lighting very easy on the eyes</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in a 09 Maxima for the 08 Infiniti M45X. I test drove the 08 G37 and a 08 BMW 550. The G 37 actually drives better but I figured I would get the top of the line and go with the M. The car does not turn heads but as the other reviewer put it, you get pampered when you get inside. I had a Maxima prior to this so I understand all the gadgets. Everything is laid out well. It has great power, you will not get embarrassed on the acceleration lane and on a smooth road you cant tell the difference between 65 and 85. The surround sound is like a concert hall. Around town the ride is a little bouncy, you will feel most bumps in the road and the M goes through gas. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car is very comfortable inside. The extras like rear view camera, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, 9.1 Gig hard drive, DVD player, user friendly navigation, the surround sound is the best I have ever heard. I still look forward to the drive to work. Mood lighting. Seats are comfy</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2009 Maxima for the 2008 M45X (new). This is a very nice luxury vehicle. It has all the toys inside that the BMW 5 series has. The smart cruise control is awesome. This vehicle accelerates very quick. This car is a keeper. It is not a head turner. I think the goodies inside with all the electronic gadgets you get to play with is where you get your monies worth out of 2008 M45X. The surround sound is awesome. Pretty quiet ride, not as smooth on rough roads as I was expecting. On the highway you cannot tell the difference between 75 and 90 mph. Simply a well built machine. I had buyers remorse initially but the car has won me over, this car is a keeper!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The acceleration. This car can move. The compact flash, hard drive and satellite radio, gives you loads of entertainment options. The surround sound is simply awesome. I am 240lbs and 6 feet tall and this car is comfortable. I enjoy taking long drives in it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased a 2008 M45 Sport in December. It was "used" with 3,700 miles and includes the Sport, Tech and Advanced Tech packages, which are just about everything you'll need unless you are shuttling around some very special friends. (The only thing it's missing is the reclining, heated rear seats... boohoo.) I looked at dozens of cars before finding this one at an incredible deal. Giving up a Porsche 911, I wanted power... check. I also wanted something luxurious... check. All without making me feel like I should be twice my age in order to drive it... that's where the Sport Pkg comes in. This car handles incredibly well for something this big and the acceleration nearly matches my 911.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The rearview camera is awesome, the sound system is incredible, the interior design and layout are very attractive and the seats are very comfortable. Also love that Infiniti puts thought into the design of their rims. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I leased mine with a two year contract. At the end of the lease, I am very happy with the car. It has good acceleration, its comfortable and its stylish but not over the top. It doesn't attract too much attention but when I sit inside I feel pampered. Good features are ride and technology. Bad features are gas mileage and noise level.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2008 M45x is one of the most luxurious and best handling sedans in this category. It may not be the best in every category but the combination of luxury, performance and features is excellent.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features of this car are all of the technology items. The lane departure warning and prevention systems are awesome. The intelligent cruise control is also great. I do a lot of driving to Vegas and Salt Lake City and I appreciate the adaptive front lighting system with HID headlamps.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I was shopping for a new car, I checked out several in the price range of 50000-60000. The Infiniti M45x beats all in this range. The car has great power and acceleration, and a sporty stance. The exterior is not quite as aggressive as it could be, but whatever the exterior lacks, the interior quickly makes up for. The interior design, layout, and overall look is amazing! The ambient lighting is beautiful and the control console is like none other. The comfort is tremendous in this car and is spacier than almost any car in its class in this price range. Overall, it is a beautiful car and does everything that I need it to.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Incredible interior, excellent technology, love the hard drive for storing music, big navigation display, lots of room, and very good power and acceleration.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am at the end of my 39 mo lease (bought 2006 model on 10/30/05), love the car from day one. Perfectly comfortable inside and outside. Excellent nav system, very useful rear view camera (day or night), especially for parking in tight places, plenty of power. Overall 9/10, only because I know, there is better cars out there which I have not tried yet.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Beautiful interior, good power, nav, satellite radio, reliable technology (computer and mechanical)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After thoroughly reviewing several cars from BMW (3 and 5 series), Jaguar (XF), Mercedes (C class), Lexus (IS F), I settled upon the M45 sport, almost fully loaded (lacks mobile DVD system). Some of these cars are like comparing apples to oranges but, the M45 above all others is best in overall value to performance ? it has the best of all worlds. It offers great performance, plenty of space, excellent design and the best technology features of anyone. While all the other cars were always sorely lacking in some features (for example, the IS F lacks space, the Jag lags in technology, etc.), the M45 simply glimmers best in everything overall, and at a respectable price comparatively.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Technologies such as a built in hard drive, compact flash and the best interface and visual navigation system are what clearly help separate the M45 apart. The interior design is excellent and build quality is superior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have the Sport model. Exciting car to drive with all the extras that a driver could desire. I don't find the control center confusing, but rather find it loaded with useful features. I push the car hard on winding roads and I find it very responsive and easy to handle. (It compares favorable to BMWs I owned in the past.) The gas mileage is not good, but that is the only disappointment (especially when premium hit $4.00 in Santa Barbara.) All together, I highly reccomend this reasonable priced luxury sport sedan. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling/performance; Blue Tooth; all control/data features. Comfortable ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this after testing the 550i. outstanding performance. Handles like a sports car but rides like one (19"wheels). Interior is quiet and serene at high speeds. I find myself regularly doing 100-120mph without even feeling it. Exhaust note is sweet. The best low beam headlights in any car I've driven (the road is evenly carpeted with bright white light) but strangely very lousy high beams. Leg room in the front and back is class leading</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>air conditioned seats. adaptive lights. wood finish.</FAVORITE>
