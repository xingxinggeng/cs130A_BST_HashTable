<TEXT>Excellent power and rides like a car. Plenty of room for my 6 foot frame. I had a full-sized 2006 Chevrolet crew cab that was easier to get into a parking space than my Frontier. Turning radius is terrible for a mid sized truck. Highway mileage isn't all that much better than the full sized Chevy 2 wheel drive, but city mileage is about 5 mpg better.(18-19 mpg). Headlights aren't very good, fog lights should be standard.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plenty of power, doesn't seem to know when you put 1000 pounds on the back! Plenty of room for hauling passengers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 18 mos, still a great truck and I am very happy with it. No mechanical problems at all. Service at dealership has been great. Just got back from a trip into the Colorado Mtns. and it did great on the steep and winding roads. Plenty of power with the 4cylinder. Got my best gas mileage yet of 27.3 mpg coming down out of the mountains. So far have averaged 24 mpg in 13,000 miles of driving with 90% as highway driving. No towing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>High seating position with good all around vision if you fold down the passenger seat or take off its headrest. I removed the rear jump seat headrests to give better vision outward.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This truck is as fun to drive today as the day I bought it. It has plenty of power, amazing handling, great 4x4 features and capability, and it very comfortable. Reliability has been great so far, and the interior and exterior hold up well to the elements. It's a great looking truck, and I frequently get compliments on it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The fully boxed frame really makes this a "truck". Other great features are the 4-wheel disk brakes, metal box (Tacoma uses composite), utilitrak tie down system, and the locking tailgate.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle because I own a 2001 frontier which has given me excellent service. I have close to 200,000 miles on it and havent had to fix anything, not even the shocks or muffler. Hoping this 2008 frontier will be just as good. My complaints are to much plastic on the inside and the turn radius is awful. I like changing the oil myself but the oil filter is really hard to get to</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have over 50,000 miles on my 2008 Frontier. It has performed well. Gas mileage on the highway is about 20.5 mpg. Good in the snow (4wd). Rides very well on the highway. Smooth ride. No mechanical issues to date. Down side: Turning radius is an issue. It is hard to park and turn in tight spaces. Inside front cabin space is noticeably smaller than a Dakota (I have had 4 dakotas). The Nissan zip type toneau cover is terrible. The cross bar support brackets break easily, it can't seal well at the corners and thus it leaks, harder to remove than a snap-type cover. The standard radio is not as good as it should be (one disc, power is low, no aux audio input). Overall I like my truck. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive a lot and I do heavy towing with this truck. I just went up to Maine towing a 7X14 trailer with 5500 GVW and got 17 MPG.

<TEXT>I purchased this truck based on the reliability of my older Nissan 4X4 pickup which I purchased new in 1984 and which still runs well. This '08 vehicle is solidly built and engineered to accommodate the demands of a truck which is used for work both on the highway and off-road. Shifting is exceptionally smooth and power from the V-6 is plentiful. Excellent handling on mountainous terrain and in winter weather. Interior features are accessible and comfortable for +6ft. passengers. Rear Jump seats not designed for long-haul comfort but space is useful for stowing items needing protection from the weather. Fuel economy has been 21 mpg highway driving. Utilitrack system a big plus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far so Good! The truck was bought in Jan 2008 and my wife only has 6000 miles on it. But fuel economy of 14 my rear end....she gets 12 and 13 if lucky! Now I will say we put a Flowmaster exhaust on there (which sounds GREAT!) and that has helped some with gas mileage. I reconmend everyone doing that to their truck. Now we did go on a road trip and got 20 mpg but that city mileage hurts. The interior is plasticy but no biggie......I mean it is a truck. Smooth shifts, powerful V-6, love the looks, etc. Other than gas mileage we have no complaints.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my forth pick up truck and second crew cab in 12 years. I had a B2200, Sonoma, Canyon and now the Frontier. While they were all good vehicles this one is by far the best. I did a lot of research and a lot of test drives before making the decision. The Toyota and the Dodge were both good but not quite good enough. I found the Frontier had more get up and go. Gas mileage is pretty standard. We have 20k and 9 months under our belt.The interiors were also very close. I am not sure what Auto reviewers have against hard plastic interior finishes but in the real world they work very well. This is probably the best all round vehicle for anyone balancing work and family.</TEXT>

Plenty of room for a field serviceman for tools and whatever you need for 4-5 day trips. Gas mileage is reasonable, 23mpg on hwy if you don't go over 70mph.

<TEXT>I was looking to buy my first pick up and test drive a new LE 4 door v6. I hit the accelerator and that truck took off and felt like it just kept gaining HP. Within the hour I was the proud owner of a Nissan. The heated seats are great. The leather is nice. The power I wanted was there. The armrests lack, need to be bigger. Fuel economy not great but it is a pick up. About 17 mpg in city, 20 on highway. The truck is really fun to drive. It handles really well in the snow, descent in rain. Glad I bought it.</TEXT>

The Frontier is a very solid truck and I'm really glad that I checked it out before making a decision.

<TEXT>Just passed 5000 miles and still impressed. Compared with Tacoma and Tundra (also have a 4Runner that we love) and was stunned by the apparent quality of the truck and great ride. Actually reminds me of a BMW that we used to have-smooth and solid. Economy just ok, about 17 around town and 20 highway. But very fun to drive. Interior is cheaper feeling than Toyotas but more flexible. And the exterior is much more attractive. Just works for me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is about 6 mos of use and 5,600 miles on the odometer. Turning circle is rather large but this is do in part to the longer wheel base and that is what helps provide a smooth highway ride. Still very comfortable on long trips. Very quiet interior, with little road, tire, or wind noise. I have averaged 24 mpg on regular fuel since I purchased this 6 mos ago. Mostly highway driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did about 6 months of serious truck research on the mid size models. I narrowed it down between Toyota and Nissan. Toyota was about $5000, more, had spongy brakes, and low seat position. Nissan offered a $5000 cheaper truck, better seating position ( I have a 34 inch inseam). Engine and transmission are super smooth and I like the gentle rumble of the engine when it starts. All controls (AC/radio) are easy to reach and I like the big knobs and well illuminated dash for night driving. Nissan has pulled away from Toyota and made a better truck. The frame is rigid, spray on bedliner as well as utilitrak and the bed extender make for a great package. The SE power package perfect. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked around for about 3 months for a truck (toyota, dodge, chevy, honda). My buddy was the one who took me to check out the frontier. I didn't like the 07 model, because of the roof-rack it had (UGLY). It's a truck, it don't need a roof-rack. When I saw the 08 which I got (no roof-rack), and test drove it, I fell in love with it. I got a great deal on it. This truck gets great gas mileage for a 4.0, handles and takes turns like a car, has a smooth ride, lots of elbow & head room. The outside looks tough, but at the same time sleek. Got lots of goodies for the bed also.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Did my homework on this truck. I was considering the Tacoma but when it came down to it, the Frontier was a much better value than the Toyota. You get more bang for your buck, more available options, and a better selection of exterior paint. I got the storm gray with charcoal cloth interior. This truck is a beauty, much better looking than the Tacoma! The Utili-track channel system and factory applied bedliner are much nicer and sturdier than the Tacoma's as well. Toyota has cheap plastic tiedown cleats while Nissans are aluminum and has five channels in bed. The powertrain is real smooth and powerful and the interior is smart and comfy. Great truck for adventure sports guys! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>One great looking truck! Nismo technology package (Rockford Fosgate stereo system, bluetooth, iPod interface). Stereo sound quality.

<TEXT>This is a really great truck. The 6 cyl gets great gas mileage-20mpg with a mix of city and highway. It has lots of storage compartments under the rear seat and you have to love the sprayed bed. The turning radius takes some getting used to. It has all the basic features one would need on a truck, plus more. We were fortunate to get model without the tacky roof rack although I wouldn't mind the running boards (I'm 5'2). </TEXT>

<TEXT>Recently purchased a SE Kingcab v6. It rides great with plenty of power. I was surprised how quiet the interior cabin is and how smooth the ride is. The only drawback is the turning radius is rather large. Gas mileage is decent for a truck - about 18-21 mpg. Visibility is great, making the truck very easy to drive. Was considering the Tacoma or the Frontier but chose the Frontier because it drives just as well but had more features for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Like the title says, Great Truck...Period! Did a lot of shopping and comparing before deciding on the Frontier. Standard features plus what you get with the SE V6 Value Pkg blew the others away. Absolute best value out there. The ride is very smooth and quiet, transmission shifts are almost unnoticeable, more power than expected, handles great. Fit and finish is awesome. Especially surprised at how little, if any wind noise at highway speeds. Plenty of interior room. Interior is rather plain but very functional. I've only got 2000 miles on it but on my last trip I avg 24.5 mpg on the highway. I highly recommend this truck!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Frontier. First was a 2001 King cab with no place for my little dogs to sit and look out the window. They love the back seat of our new truck! Day after we got our truck we went on a 2000 mile road trip. MPG was 20-25. Best mpg is at 60-65 hwy. It might take you a little longer to get where your going but worth it at the pump. Better ride than my old truck more like a car. Turning radius took some time to get used to, old truck was much better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the end of March. Have put around 4600 miles on in 4 months without an incident. Performance is incredible, handling is superb for a 4wd truck and the ride is very comfortable, but it is still a truck with a light back end. Mileage is on par with the EPA average. The light output from the headlights is not the best, highly recommend getting the foglights as they help a great deal. Only issue thus far is a cracked windshield washer nozzle which is being replaced under warranty in a few days. I was torn between the Frontier, Ranger, and Tacoma. This truck can not be beat for its value, power and practicality. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded the 06 4x4 Tundra for this one. Just couldn't justify 15mpg after selling the camper. More power would be good but this 4cyl is a big upgrade from older versions of the Nissan 4cyl automatic, especially considering how much larger this truck is than frontier's of the past. Excellent handling, great breaks & smooth ride for a small truck. Would like to see Nissan incorporate their cvt technology into this 4 banger to maximize it's power.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I decided that it was time to buy a truck I narrowed my choices down to the Tacoma, Dakota, and the Frontier. I quickly decided that the Tacoma was out of my price range, so that left the Dakota and the Frontier. When you put these two trucks side by side there is no comparison the Frontier wins by a knockout. It's bigger, more powerful and comes with way more features for a smaller price tag. I love this truck, it's is fun to drive, looks great with the chrome grill and bumpers unlike the cheap grey plastic bumpers of similarly priced Dakotas. Also, there may only be 23 reviews on this site for the Frontier but every one is good. That has to say something! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just like almost everyone else writing here, it was between the Tacoma and Frontier for me. Always wanted a Tacoma, until I drove the Frontier. More options for $2000 less than the Tacoma, more interior room, bigger engine, 4-wheel discs, and traction control. The engine revs like my dad's G35, I had to get out and check under the hood to make sure it wasn't the same engine. Nope, just the same technology. The truck also rides much sportier than the Tacoma, again, makes me feel like I am driving that Infiniti again. I am getting between 17-18 MPG around town going from work and back, but I also don't hammer on it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently traded my car and stepped up to becoming a truck owner. I had planned on getting a Toyota Tacoma forever, and came very close, but before purchasing I decided to shop around alittle, and I am glad that I did. Once I took the Frontier off the parking lot for a test drive, I knew it was a done deal. The smoothness of the ride and powertrain blew the Tacoma away, not to mention a larger truck for less money (especially the dump)and more POWER. The dealership was very friendly and threw in a few extra accessories (unlike Toyota). It was a no brainer. It's a truck that handles like a car or SUV, I love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have wanted a truck for the last 10 yrs so I finally bought it. It was either the Tacoma or the Frontier that I narrowed it to. The exterior of the truck is gorgeous. The interior has a lot of hard plastics but are assembled nicely. I am amazed how smooth the powertrain is in this truck. It provides plenty of power for passing on the freeway. The optional stereo sounds very nice. The audio controls on the steering wheel are handy as is the bluetooth. Seat comfort is very good in the front seats and acceptable in the rear. Fuel economy is about 16- 17 mixed and 20-22 on the freeway so far. Purchased for invoice plus $3000 in rebates. Nissan was a better value than the Toyota overall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Nissan Frontier since their redesign in 2005 just turned my 3 yr lease and now I have the Red Pearl 2008 as loaded as it can come. It's a great midsize truck good for work or play. I used it for both work family and a little beach riding. I regularly max the 4.0 out highway driving daily in PA. It will max out right about 115, electronically limited at 4500 RPM top gear which is acceptable given that you're still going way too fast anyway.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Beige soft leather, dual power seats, Nice bedliner, utility rack, roof rack, I use it all the time. The Rockford Fosgate 10 speaker system sounded great, free 3 months XM, 6 disc in dash changer w/MP3/WMA iPod plug. No in-dash navi, poor decision.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drive a lot of miles (25,000/year) so a reliable vehicle is my primary concern - followed by 4X4 as I live in a rural area. So far both are met in this vehicle. At present I have 10,000 miles (5 months) so have had a chance to knock it about a bit. The ride is a bit harsh, but not unexpected. Interior is a bit plain, though functional. I have developed one small buzz in the dash in this point. No other issues to date with build/function. The sound quality of the radio does improve over time. Wish it had an ipod jack standard. Despite the many miles there are so far no chips nor blemishes in the paint. Seats need less front cushion or more rear cushion. Overall: Good truck</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Reliability/build both seem up to challenge. Visibility is good, Highway mileage at 22MPG seems great for a 4X4 vehicle of this size. Power is excellent. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove the Tacoma before trying out the Frontier. I had no intention of purchasing a four banger, but after giving both the Tacoma and Frontier 4 cyls a shot, I wasn't let down at all. I like both trucks, but I picked up the Frontier for a couple of thousand less than a comparable Tacoma. Currently averaging 22+ MPG with mixed city/hiway driving and a lot of up and down RPM fluctuation while it is still in the break-in period. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Peppy four banger with good gas mileage so far.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I live in the Northeast and owned an earlier version of the 2WD Frontier (a 2000), so there have been a handful of days each year where I have said "I'm getting a 4-wheel drive next time," but when that time came, I just couldn't do it. I couldn't bring myself to go with the 14 - 19 mpg. This is my primary commuter, and I just couldn't justify it. That having been said, this truck at least makes you feel like you chose the 4 X 4, with its high riding position, decidedly big-truck suspension and aggresive styling. If you can bring yourself to own up to it, you'll find the four cyl engine is plenty tough enough for weekend chores, hauling a popup and merging onto the highway. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, comfortable seats, seating height, and the "suicide" doors to the rear seat. The interior is pretty civilized, and I think at least on a par with the Toyotas.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased the Crew Cab 4x4 LE with floor mats, hitch & cloth interior in March 2008. Traded in a 2002 Ranger. Driving position is comfortable and the feel on the road is solid and sturdy. With the 261hp engine, good acceleration and the BF Goodrich OEM tires are good, but not great. The turning circle is a bit too big for the size of the vehicle. I like the covered/weather tight hitch connection. Two glove boxes are nice, but one could be cooled. The steering wheel mounted cruise control buttons are not illuminated at night. The orange dash lights should be blue for easier night vision adjustment.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Appearance and acceleration. Factory spray in bedliner is a superb feature for those of us who use our trucks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased the truck and have only been driving it for about two weeks. I love this truck. I have always liked Nissan Frontiers, found them to be very reliable. This truck is a winner. I do wish the arm rest was longer though and it got better gas mileage, but overall I'm very satisfied.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very smooth ride, good for family trips.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Only have 170 mi on odometer. Drove home to Littleton from Greeley, CO on I-25 at 75MPH. Truck surprised me on the broken concrete with the amount of bump steer. Front end of the truck gets light and jumps all over. Wife following me in our van and I noticed swaying in the long bed when changing lanes at 75 MPH (not to severe). Other than that this truck is a pleasure to drive. I enjoy the power and solid truck feel. I bought the truck to tow my Ford Windstar while we are traveling. Surprised to find out that UHaul considers this truck too small to haul my Windstar on their tow dolly. Nissan owner's manual also recommends electric braked trailer to haul anything over 1000 lbs. Recommend!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, ride, lots of storage, looks. Solid feel. Utility bed. Standard equipment.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased this truck within the past week so please keep this in mind when reviewing this score. This is an impressive truck with a quiet and smooth ride (could feel no vibration from the 4cylinder engine). this is a 4x2, with manual 5 speed tranny. Shifts smoothly. Great outward visibility. As soon as the artic conditions moderate here I plan to drive this vehicle a lot. Right now truck and I are hibernating. I will review this truck once a year.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Manual transmission, a/c, and cruise control. High sitting position with good view. AM/FM, CD radio.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have 1000 miles on it and am well satisfied. Have driven full size trucks for years. This is my first compact truck and I love it. Size is perfect. Performance is excellent. Looked at Toyota, Colorado, Ranger. This is the best of the bunch.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the handling. Firm steering and no body lean or roll. Ride is a little stiff but not objectionable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It was between a Ford Sport Trac and The Nissan. I have a 99 Ranger with 334K on it and still running with no major repairs. After comparing the two, Sport Trac vs Frontier I picked the Nissan for mainly two things, price, Frontier was less expensive and second, it had a longer bed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Impressed with the 261HP & 281FT-LBS of the 4.0L V6, even at >6000ft elevation where I live. Excellent quality all-around! VERY spacious in the front of the cab. Mine has "SE Value Pkg" which includes ABLS brakes, bedliner, pwr windows and locks, RKE, cruise-control, and painted aluminum wheels. It's actually a mid-sized truck with a nice, high road-stance. Overall a great truck for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Nice tight little truck, but not too little. Ride is stiff/ bouncy, but not bad for the wheel base and it IS a 4X4. Yup, it does have a wide steering radius, but I'll get used to it. Did good when I had 18" of snow in the driveway. Haven't had it to the hunting camp (mud) yet, but performance in that arena depends on the teeth on your tires, not the drive train. Comfortable interior, good ergo's for the controls. Drove carefully on a road trip and got 22.2 MPG with the cruise set at 65 MPH. Not bad for a 4.0 liter 6 cyl 4X4 w/ auto transmission. I like it a lot, and would recommend it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet, solid. But I'm a Jeep wrangler guy, so am used to amish buggy-like ride quality. It is a good sized truck, not stupid big like everybody makes them now.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great family truck with lots of power. The Nismo model I purchased had all the features I was looking for including the most important feature of all, the full side curtain air bags. I highly recommend the Nissan Frontier. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought my '08 Nissan King Cab w/4.0L V6 and only have 100 miles on it. So far I love the vehicle although it's too early to tell about the gas mileage which is rated 14 city/19 hwy. which is pretty poor. However, the price when compared to the Tacoma with the same features is much lower for the Nissan even though the quality is right up there with Toyota.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rides like a car, not a truck! Plenty of power and plenty of room for up front driver and passenger.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The drive is solid. The power is excellent and it is very quiet and comfortable inside. I compared it to the Toyota tacoma and the Ford ranger. It was obvious to me that there were very large quality differences. The Frontier was a much nicer vehicle then the other two makes that I compared it with. Also the value of the dollar for similar features beat the Toyota. Buy this truck if you want to be completely satisfied with your decision.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Let me tell all of you out there that are going back and forth on the frontier and tacoma issue Ive had tacomas in every model from 00 to 2007. I just purchased 07 Nismo 4wd cc, there is no comparison. The newer frontier is a lot more solid truck than the new taco. Engine, trans, axles oh ya 32 spline vs 31 even interior. Overall the frontier is a much more solid truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first pickup truck. I looked at a Titan and it was just too big for my needs. I live and work in the city, but snowboard, mountain bike, and haul around kids, dogs, stuff. This truck is a lot of fun to drive and feels really solid.</TEXT>
