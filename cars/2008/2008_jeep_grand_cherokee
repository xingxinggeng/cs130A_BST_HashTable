<TEXT>I LOVE MY JEEP! This is my first GC. I purchased my 08 Overland last summer when gas prices where over 4 dollars a gallon, got 11 grand knocked off the price because they were not selling. Who's laughing now! I test drove a Lexus IS350, Ford Explorer, Edge, Lincoln MKX and Acura MDX. None can compare to the quality of this Jeep. Great fit and finish! For a SUV it rides like a Dream! Leather and Wood is Beautiful! Black with the chrome really turns heads, HID's are flawless! And let's not forget enough power under the hood to really humiliate the kid in the Mustang at the red light. Bustin a** with a EMPTY baby seat in the back! HaHa, I Love My HEMI. German styling/American Muscle, Awesome!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>HEMI! Leather Interior, NAV and My GIG Actually, I Love It ALL! Can't complain about the gas mileage. I knew what the EPA was when I bought it! Actually gets 16/18 city and 18/21 Hwy!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the real deal. It is not a cute-ute. It is not a car on stilts. This is a Jeep descended from the original. What does that mean. It means that the Jeep will not be the most spacious, it will not be the most efficient, it will not be the most refined. But, when properly equipped, it will take four people and their gear through almost all conditions in great comfort. Looking for a family hauler - - look elsewhere. This is not a modern SUV. It is old-school. If you want to really use your roof rack, use your 4wd, and use your hitch, then this is your vehicle. If you want to putter around the mall with the kids, this is not your vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>What drew me to this jeep was probably what draws a lot of women to a 4x4 SUV- I wanted to be able to drive over stuff and feel powerful so no one would mess with me on the road anymore. After years in 4 door sedans, it was time. The 2008 JGC has a sleek and classic body design and a standard interior design- nothing fancy, and that's the way I like it. I get about 21 mog, which is way less than when I drove a Honda, but I was well aware when buying this Jeep, fuel economy was not going to be that great, but I wanted something big and if I wanted fuel economy, I could have bought a Prius. Bottom line- I have fun everyday with my Jeep. </TEXT>

<TEXT>2006 SRT8 marked our return to Jeep. We found it a blast to drive and were completely satisfied with all aspects of the car. It was trouble free and was reluctantly traded for the 2007 Overland diesel. We ran that car continuously for a little over a year , with oil and filter changes the only work required. After 40,000 trouble free miles we traded for 2008 Overland diesel to avail ourselves of the last great meld of German engine and the best of Detroit. We could not be more satisfied, the 2008 is more refined than the 2007 with the feature list expanded and perfected. The reliability and build integrity is something we have remarked from the 2006 SRT to today's Overland. Love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I bought this Jeep due to the great service from our 96 Cherokee. We could not be happier. The style is great, the interior and function extremely well thought out, and it is very comfortable and safe to drive. The room is generous and the performance with the 4.7 V-8 is incredible. The ride is excellent, brakes and handling very impressive. It is also a perfect size--fits nicely in our 2-car garage with another car with room to walk. This is a fine and durable vehicle to serves us as we move into our 60's with grace and verve! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a JGC Overland with 5.7 HEMI. What a nice car! Very quiet yet engine is strong when it needs to be. I was considering to buy a Range Rover Sport, but JGC has definitely nicer ride and navigation system with hard drive to rip your songs. If you are considering JGC, try to get the HID headlight because they are really bright.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle 1 year ago and have had no major problems. Information system is excellent. The hard drive option is excellent for music, I have 1600 songs saved. I've averaged around 16-17 mpg in the city and 18-21MPG on hwy for the 4.7L V8. Bluetooth for the phone is excellent, heated seats front and rear are great. Only option I don't have is rear DVD player. Only issue is sometimes the navigation/radio will freeze up. Shutting the car off and back on solves the problem. I can count on 1 hand how many times its happened, and I've driven it 22,000 miles. Steering wheel radio controls are great and rear view camera helps immensely in parking. Great in towing & snow. No maintenance</TEXT>

<TEXT>OK, I went to get my lease '08 Jeep and have regretted ditching my BMW every since. Soon after I picked up my overland the sealant on the quarter glass window started melting, took numerous calls to Leith Headquarters and Chrysler headquarters until they finally agreed to fix my Jeep. On top of that the electronic items in the car fail at any given time - including auto headlights!!! Still after all this time it malfunctions at any given time, stalls on the road while driving, speakers stop working, hard drive crashes and stalls, wipes out info stored in it, the list is endless as to what malfunctions on this Jeep!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently traded my old car in because I needed a vehicle with a trailer hitch. I had looked at many different vehicles, and none had everything I wanted. This Jeep is perfect for me. I got a well equipped Laredo 4WD model with the Red Rock Crystal Pearl paint, and black interior. The color is awesome! It drives smooth and it has a lot of power. The build quality feels very good. I love the sun and sound package which has a power sunroof and the 6 CD and satellite upgraded radio. Overall, for the decent price, it is a great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my JGC in Aug of 08 and have now had it 6 mos and put 14,000+ on it. The ONLY problem I have had is to replace the RF window regulator. When I picked it up it had no problems for warranty repair and none since til the regulator. Drives great and gets up 26 mpg on the hwy and 18 to 22 in town. The roof, due to the sunroof, is too low, but otherwise I love it. The only other problem: the reset for the trip computer is on the steering wheel and is too easy to accidentally hit getting in or out and you inadvertantly reset it without knowing it! Put the reset on the dash. So far, it has no rattles or odd noises. This is my 3rd Jeep and by far the best. Good acceleration.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Everything considered - this is far and away the best GC that we have ever owned. The 2004 Overland that we traded in was great - but this one really shines. The design and build quality seem far superior than previous years. The engine - although thirsty at almost all speeds - is responsive and relatively quiet for its size. We had 34" of snow during December and the Jeep navigated the hills and drifts with ease. Far better in fact than our Wrangler. The MyGig Nav system / audio is great.</TEXT>

It's really nice (wood, wooden steering wheel, leather, and much more. the fastest I've had this SUV up to is 140mph (actual speed) and this car has no governor.

<TEXT>This is my first SUV and my first Jeep and I must say I am truly pleased so far. I've had it almost 3 weeks now and it is exactly what I was looking for. It drives smooth, has good pickup, and has some really great features. I got one with 16k mileage with the Xpackage for an awesome deal! I saw on some of the other models that people left reviews for that they had a problem with water leaking, I drove mine in torrential downpour last night with no problem. I looked at many different kinds of SUV's before choosing this one and I am fully satisfied with my choice. Comfortable, roomy, fun to drive, and an overall great SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What's the Caddy commercial say about returning the favor? Yes! My JGC definitely returns the favor! Nice ride, fun to drive and the 4.7L has great pick-up. Haven't tried the E85 yet - so can't comment on performance/mileage there. Now that gas prices are down - my purchasing a V8 in June when gas was near $4 doesn't look so stupid. How are people complaining about gas mileage in these reviews? You saw what the EPA estimates were when you bought it - as long as you're not getting worse mileage than EPA estimates, how can you rate gas mileage as poor? I'm consistently getting a couple of more mpg in comparison to EPA estimates. Got 21mpg on 600 mile highway trip recently.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our second Laredo, having purchased one brand new in 98, that we now use as a third vehicle and for the kids to use. Our new one: after driving it for week, we noticed this noise coming from the back of the engine when the radio and everything was off, except the car itself. It is a very annoying noise, clicking sound. We took it back. They pulled another 08 off the lot into the service garage and had us listen to it. It had the same noise! Nothing wrong and nothing they can do about it. Probably would not have purchased an 08 had we heard this before hand. And it says 4wd, when its actually full time awd.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I agree with everyone, it is a fun vehicle, and the 4.7l v8 is a thrill! I bought 2 Rocky mountain models, both with the 4.7's. My problem has been quality and Chrysler. One door had 1/4" drop, and the instrument cluster blistered. Chrysler llc's support and dealer support are non existent. After great hassle they have had the vehicle for > 36 days, and > 6 attempts. Worst part is that they have since caused more damage than if I had hit a deer. Bottom line is it is a really fun vehicle... But quality is questionable, and support of product is non existent! Hope this helps buyers find things before purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased a 2008 JGC limited with a HEMI. Great ride, great comfort, very luxurious. Before purchasing, I test drove, the BMW X-3 and X-5, Lincoln MKX, Hummer H-3, and the ML 320. The jeep has the best ride of all, has the most features for the money, and has real capability. I did tons of research, then test drove the jeep and it clearly has been engineered with higher quality than the past models. The Hemi is a great engine, and does use gas quite well, but I've been on the highway getting around 21 mpg. I'm told it gets better. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Was perfectly happy with my 2001 GC Laredo until I saw a "half price" ad in the paper for a new 2008. Went to find the "catch" but ended up buying a loaded GC for less than $17k plus my old 126k miles Laredo - just add tax tag and title! After about one week I have to say this is a much nicer vehicle than my '01 ever was. Leather, fog lites, sunroof, all power, heated seats, adjustable pedals, etc ... First tank at just over 18 mpg and though it's not a strong engine, it's good enough for what I need. The Boston stereo sounds decent and Sirius for a year is great! Top it all off with the lifetime power train warranty and it was a pretty good deal.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought as subsitute for a FJ Cruiser. FJ is too expensive used. JGC-Loredo was in my P range - meets my wants & requirements. Bought used with ~25K mi. Would not recommend brand new purchase - too expensive. Wife likes it, good crash ratings (5/5 & 4/5). Not so good in traffic. Not driven in bad weather or long trips yet. Price can be great if used. I see lots of older JGCs on the road - leads me to believe it is a quality vehicle. OVERALL RATING: WOULD RECOMMEND. Cheap if used, good quality, fun to drive. Meets SUV and comfort expectations. See other fields for additional info.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a great looking Laredo entry level 4WD V6 model in August. I couldn't turn this deal down because they were offering such a bargain. It cost me the same as a new Honda Civic- a much smaller car! This car, however, is "bare bones" so to speak, with no options at all. But that's okay, I don't have a family so I don't need all that leg and cargo room and all the fancy gadgets. My Jeep, however, came with an inherent electrical problem that took the dealer two days to fix- it was the Junction Box that contained the wiring for the rear door lock that wasn't working correctly. I know I will love this vehicle for many years- it's perfect for me!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd G.C. in a couple of years. What a treat to drive! Compared to the foreign bubbles and even Ford and GM's tired designs, the Grand Cherokee has them beat, hands down. Chrysler's incentives are the best in the industry. Gas mileage is consistently in the high 'teens around town and low to mid 20s on the highway. The 6 cylinder engine has great low end torque and doesn't feel like it's straining at all, uphill or on acceleration lanes on the freeway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With only 1300 miles and three trips to the dealership I have not received any satisfaction with a leak. If it rains hard I can be assured of water leaking into the drivers compartment. I'm very disappointed by the lack of interest on the part of the dealership and Chrysler on repairing this issue. There appears to be an obvious design flaw they appear unwilling to confront. Chrysler gets a zero on customer satisfaction or empathy. Despite being a Chrysler customer since 1987 I would stay away from this company. They're giving American manufactures a bad name.</TEXT>

Compared with Ford Escape, Hyundai Santa Fe and a few others of similar size, price. We had bought our son an '07 GC last year, so I stopped at the dealer to look at the '08 GC's. MUCH more comfortable than Escape or Santa Fe. Have taken it off road in CO mountains and it performed great. It is my everyday drive vehicle and I am very happy.

Fit and finish is on a par with the Acura MDX and Toyota Sequoia that we also looked at. The GC, because of dealer incentives, was clearly the best buy.

<TEXT>This is our Fourth Jeep grand Cherokee and our second New one. I think they went the wrong direction with the design. The cargo area is now just barely large enough to take our Dog, much less some of the home improvement items I need to haul on the weekends. With just over 9000 miles we have it in the shop for the second time. It is the Laredo with the 4.7 V8, but does not run as strong as my 2000 JGC with the same V8. Seems like they detuned or adjusted things to make it hold up for the lifetime warranty. I'm still a fan, but if I have to have it in the shop again my impression of Jeep and approval will drop drastically.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've driven cross country twice, it's my daily driver, trail rig, and family mover. My Jeep has done everything I've asked of it without a single maintenance issue to date. I've ridden trails from IL, OK, TX, NM, AZ, CO & UT, and the QDII system is hands down the best 4WD system available on the market. Front, rear, center ELSD's provide a sure-footedness I never experienced in my other 4X4's. The luxury is top shelf. Every gizmo I could want, MyGig, HID's, 4 seat warmers, nav system. All work together to provide an incredible driving experience. And it always looks sharp, aggressive, and ready to go.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my family's 5th Jeep and I love it! We purchased an 08 Commander in March and this rig a few days ago - by far the most comfortable Jeep I have owned or rode in. I have no preconceived notions, it isn't a BMW or MB It's a Jeep and meant to be dirty and ridden hard. It is responsive, quiet on the road, reasonable at the pump (22 MPG so far), and an overall fun experience. Not to mention I purchased on last day of July and got the $6000 factory rebate before it expired. I have found Jeep very responsive at the dealer level to customer issues in the past - far more than the company car Fords and Mercs I had been driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet and comfortable ride - easy to talk on phone or listen to radio at normal levels. Boston Acoustic speakers are a terrific with satellite radio too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently purchased a 2008 Black Jeep Cherokee Limited (4.7L V-8). Believe it or not, this is now the third Black Jeep Cherokee in our garage (both my wife and son drive 2004 models)...and overall we couldn't be more pleased with the performance, reliability and quality. I am getting 19+ MPG! The 2008 has all the "bells and whistles" (automatic high beams, automatic wipers, iPod compatible, excellent storage, GPS, chrome accents that really dress up the exterior especially of a black vehicle). My only complaint is with the narrow leg room and pedal configuration for the driver (however I am over 6' tall).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our Jeep Grand Cherokee had the 5.7 Hemi with the Quandra Drive II transmission. Last week the entire car was engulfed in flames and my wife and in laws were lucky to get out in time. Luckily a police officer was directly behind the car when the fire started, stating he thought that transmission fluid leaked onto the exhaust system and that cause the fire. However, what started small got aggressive real fast, entering the passenger compartment in under 90 seconds. Car was back to the dealer 9 times for the same problem, the transmission. Stay away from this vehicle. Chrysler can't fix their own product and it could have killed by wife and her parents. Never again Chrysler.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this Jeep Grand Cherokee brand new. It had only 6 miles on it when I drove it off the lot. I now have had it 16 days and went to wash it for the first time and the paint starting peeling off the front bumper. I called Jeep services and they said I need to bring it in to see if it was covered under my warranty. When I bought the car it said the paint was cover for 3 years unlimited. I am just so upset! I mean how can the paint already be peeling when I haven't even made a payment.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Previous review posted on 1/30/08. I just want to update my review of this vehicle for potential purchasers. My original review noted MPG at 14. It has since improved to 17+ MPG which is acceptable to me. I have the Laredo with 4.7 V8 not the Limited. (No listing for Laredo V8). Laredo V8's are hard to find, most are 3.7 V6's. Get the 4.7 V8 if you can find one. Good value and performance for $34K with "E" package minus discounts and rebates. "E" package includes remote start, heated seats,adjustable pedals. 115V outlet, Boston Acoustics stereo and more.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance of 4.7 V8 at all speeds and better gas mileage than Hemi. Remote start and heated seats in winter. All weather traction of this 4x4 is superb. Better than my 05 Chrysler Pacifica AWD which was excellent. Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo handles like a sports car and is fun to drive anywhere.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Jeep GC.. had a 04 GC Ltd and loved it. This vehicle is definitely heavier and I felt the Hemi would help. It's got all the power and luxury I wanted plus the upgraded touch screen nav (I had the old one on my 04), Haven't actually used the myGIG feature yet. Love the looks, fun to drive. Gas mileage sucks but that's the trade off. Good pricing for all the features of a luxury vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking at all non-American made vehicles as my next car. All these cars came with a premium for this luxury I was looking for in my next car. I decided to go with the JGC Limited because it met all my needs with out the premium price. After have driven this for three weeks, it was the best choice I could have made to stay with Chrysler! It has all the toys and buttons I was looking for in my next vehicle. The only real thing I would like to see improved is the gas mileage in city and highway. I am proud to still be driving American again, which completely surprised me! You will not go wrong if you consider this vehicle for price, style and toys included.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sounds of the engine and sound system. Blue-tooth was a must for me, but the Nav, SAT and DVD was a great plus for me.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Look before you leap. If you are in the market for a fun to drive SUV, this jeep offers a smooth ride. However, for the $45k plus, you are better off with choosing a luxury model, so you have something to show for it. While they claim, the seats are leather, they feel and smell like plastic or as some marketing genius dubbed it, leatherette. The backseat is so stiff that you can barely make it around the block without a backache. Same for front seats, no lumbar! Engine revs a lot, between shifting and no one needs to remind you how often you will be handing the gas attendant $50+ to fill er up. I'm stuck in a lease, but the good news, I can just hand the keys over and say so long. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 5th Jeep Grand Cherokee. 1st and 2nd were Laredos with the 4.0L 6cyl engine. Jeeps 3 and 4 were fully loaded Limiteds with the 4.7L V-8's. These limiteds were great with lots of power and torque and fun to drive. Without doing much research I decided to get the 6cyl 3.7L in my fully loaded Laredo. Since I no longer had to tow, I thought I'd save some money and get better fuel economy. BIG MISTAKE. This has got to be the weakest engine in its class and because it has to work so hard to keep this relatively heavy vehicle moving the gas mileage is bad too. I get about 1.5 mpg better than the v-8 and at highway speeds the mileage is actually worse than the V-8.Get the V- 8!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned 1 wrangler,leased 3 GC's and 2 Libertys. I bought the Jeep Overland after comparing it with Land Rover, Benz and Audi. I was so impressed with Jeep's exterior,interior and price. I am a loyal Jeep guy and thought about the Land Rover, but the price was not worth the value. I love this truck and I am glad I stuck with Jeep. It is a head turner, very comfortable and the power is unreal. Every morning I look forward to driving to work because of the luxury and sound system and the ride. I know there is a new design out in 2011, but it will have to be drastic to get me out of this one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the Laredo 4x4 with the 3.7 v6.it is a very good family vehicle.the rear entertainment system is great.no problem going on vacation with it. the engine is decently powerful and has OK acceleration loaded, i wish it felt more powerful or i should of got 4.7 but the 3.7 is good enough.watch your fuel economy because it goes down very fast if u have a heavy foot. i wish it had more oomph at 40 mph but this jeep engine is for better fuel economy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've Owned and driven many types of SUV's, from the Ford Expedition, and Explorer, Suburban, Dodge Durango, which I've all owned. To the Hummer, Cayanne, Range Rover, which my friends own. I'm very impressed, with Jeep Grand Cherokee, it has a very sturdy, yet comfortable, luxurious drive. The layout of the controls, and room and the car are great. If you are thinking of mid size suv to get. I highly suggest this one. One thing that might help you over the top is the fact that this is the Suv choice of many millionaires.</TEXT>

<TEXT>One of the things that really sticks out is how quite and smooth the vehicle is. It's almost like riding in my Acura TL. There is no squeaks or rattles unlike my TL. The GC has many techy things like backup camera, auto dimming headlights and auto wipers that I think are great. I like the new HID lights that really light up the road and adjust automatically depending on road/load conditions. Build quality overall is an 9 overall. Some door panels do not line up. Also the drivers seat bottom needs to be replaced because of a pucker in the leather.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had been dedicated to Japanese cars based on too many bad experiences with American cars. I wanted to buy American, and gave Jeep a chance based primarily on their warranty. It was a great decision. I absolutely love this car. Jeep used quality materials throughout the car, giving it a solid feel. It rides nice, and is great in the bad weather we can get in the Chicago area. The acceleration on the 6 cylinder is good, with the mileage being what I expected. I shopped for quite a while before buying this car, and looked at just about every small and mid size SUV on the market. If I had to do it all over again, I would make the same decision. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After considering a number of other SUVs, this our 6th new JGC, and it may be the best of the bunch. Quality is perfect so far, the fuel economy is better than the 2005 JGC that was traded-in, and the interior has been upgraded. This is one beautiful Jeep, inside and out, that gets lots of compliments from people we don't even know. It is solid, comfortable, safe, fun to drive, and we love it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the GC just a few weeks ago and couldn't be happier. Bought a loaded Laredo with the 4.7 engine. This motor has plenty of power and has decent fuel mileage but not great. Leather interior is very comfortable and all controls are very easy to reach and use. Jeep redesigned the GC interior for 08 and it shows...it looks richer and not so plasticky. Exterior front fascia has been improved also and has a more "clean" look to it. All in all I highly recommend especially with the 4.7 engine. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Both exterior and interior upgrades to the 08 GC. Easy to use controls and comfortable seats. Raw power of the 4.7 engine...fantastic four wheel drive vehicle. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the third Jeep I have owned. They interior is getting smaller and cramped in the back seat. Too many cavities around the shifter/console area. I have a 6 cyl and it is loud when starting off. No under the hood light as on other similar Jeeps I have owned and I get better gas mileage from my 2001 Jeep. The tach display has been moved to the left which is awkward. For a vehicle this expensive I rate it average. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd JGC, having traded in a 2005 JGC Laredo. Getting into an 08 JGC Overland with the 5.8L Hemi was awesome. The power and acceleration is amazing for an SUV. Gas Mileage so far is about 15 MPG in the city, not too bad for a big engine. Ext. looks are good, and the interior is sharp and refined. Lots of extras with the Nav, Sat. radio, Bluetooth, Back-up camera, etc. I chose this JGC over the Acura MDX because of what you get for the price. Dealer incentives made the JGC more affordable than the MDX. Plus I got the same or more bells and whistles and a vehicle that will leave the MDX,CX9, and RX in my dust. Great Truck!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>4th Jeep - all Gr Ckees. I've been purchasing Laredo with Rocky Mtn edition - currently equipped with the X-package - perfect for me. Handling is solid as usual. Not as nimble as our Subie Tribeca. Fuel economy is as advertised. Since 05, I'm more confident with the handling. The shift placement of the gears has changed - I'm not certain if for the better or worse. Outside, nice stylings. Inside, huge improvement. Doesn't seem dated anymore as 05 did. Seats are more comfortable. Steering column and seat placement make for good(better) driving posture. We have two Britax in the back and plenty of leg room for driver, passenger and two boys to kick the seats. I'm very satisfied.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior stylings improved! Remote starter on Xpackage. Better instrumentation layout - dash and radio, steering wheel controls placement. Telescopic steering column. Seat positioning. I'm impressed with the handling since 05. Lifetime warranty on engine, trani and 4wd sys. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Jeep. I've owned several SUV's and the JCG ranks very favorably with all of them and exceeds most. Although I went with the V6, I am happy with it. I'm getting 20.6 mpg with 80 percent highway driving. My range varies between 340-360 miles per tank. So far I have 2000 miles and expect the mileage to improve a bit. The JGC handles good and seems well put together. The transmission shifts smoothly and haven't heard the "clunk" so far. I think Chrysler has finally got the message about their poor quality reputation. </TEXT>

Every option available on the car was ordered. I have always been a big Jeep fan, but this new model is much more refined than expected. I compared to "luxury" SUVs, and for the price, there is no comparison. The engine has plenty of pep, and the interior is nicer than the Lexus or Infinity I looked at. I don't care what the reviews say, the Jeep is as big as any "crossover" in terms of interior space, but the build quality is much higher of any SUV I looked at. This is definitely a huge contender against any SUV you look at.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After considering many other vehicles, I'm so glad I got the JGC. Smooth acceleration, quiet cabin, great techie tools--the Nav, bluetooth, hard drive for my music (uploaded via USB, about 800 songs fit w/room to spare). Incentives made it more affordable to lease than the Liberty, and when I feel the Hemi respond, I know I made the right choice. Of course, the gas mileage is lousy, but after driving a 4-banger for 3 years, I was ready to get some power....and this Jeep really delivers. It won out over the Honda Pilot, Ford Edge, Saturn Vue, Mazda CX-9 & Mitsubishi Outlander. The incentives plus dealer's willingness to negotiate made it a no-brainer. If you like 'em loaded, look at JGC!</TEXT>
