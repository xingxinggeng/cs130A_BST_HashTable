<AUTHOR>Q7 Stowe</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Our Q7 has been at the dealer for the past 45 days and they have no estimate as to when they will return it. This car has been a nightmare. Brakes started screeching at 2000 miles and in the 2.5 years that I have owned this car, it has been at the dealer over 20 times (excluding scheduled maintenance). The starter has been replaced twice which requires the entire engine to be pulled from the vehicle (nice design). Audi does have roadside assistance which is nice since I have had to utilize this service 6 times to have the vehicle towed to the dealer. The Q7 S-line is a cool looking SUV, if the cool design does not turn heads, the screeching brakes will!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this vehicle now for about 9 months and completely love it. Mine has most of the extra bells and whistles, and I have been totally spoiled by the features - even the ones I thought I'd never use (keyless entry/start, lane assist, back up camera). With the 21 inch wheels this thing corners and handles more like a sports car than a SUV. But the beefy curb weight (while providing for a sense of security and impervious-ness-ity) definitely makes for less than thrilling accelerations. I expected this though when I bought it, so no surprises there. A few minor issues with squealing brakes and the like have been promptly handled by Audi care and all-in-all I am very happy with my Q7.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Keyless start/entry. Handling with the 21 inch tires. Look/feel of s-line. Feeling of security. Technological features </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love the car except the electronics. Console buttons shorted out from windex used to clean off finger prints. Really bad design as the buttons are not sealed and will short out with only a couple of drops. Audi will not stand behind. Cost $1000 to replace in the first 6 months. Afraid to use the cup holders that are located above the elect. 2 drops and another $1000. pule the hassle. Want my Range Rover back. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have Q7 Premium S-line 4.2, absolutely great, fun to drive. But, it would not be so great without all features. In my opinion adaptive air suspension is a must, adaptive cruise control is fun, great help, but be careful, it provides safety, but stay alert, in critical situations you need to take over. Parking sensors is also a must with such relatively large vehicle. The line assist possible saved me already from couple of dangerous situations and side assist also, although it takes some effort to learn to look at it. A lot of features and after 5 months I am still discovering how to use them in concert effectively. Tested BMW X5 (too small) and Merc. GL550, did not like the controls</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Adaptive air suspension. Adaptive cruise control. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My husband purchased this car for me and traded in our A4 cab for it. I loved it at first. Then a month into ownership, the trunk latch broke. It wouldn't close all the way so I had to drive the hour away to the nearest dealership (twice) to get it fixed. 2 weeks ago, my MMI system stopped working and it was stuck to only play CDs. I took it in today and was told you're out of luck because you spilled something on it. Had I known this was such a common problem, I wouldn't have bought this car. Now I have to shell out the money out of pocket to replace the MMI system. After reading a bunch of reviews, it seems to be an extremely common problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Drove 4700 miles from Ohio to Wyoming and Montana, thru Chief Joseph highway and Beartooth pass. Typtronic tranmission was spectacular in moving through the passes, hair-pin turns and altitudes over 11000 ft. Six passengers very comfortable. Gas mileage acceptable and with hi speed western states 75mph limits a real dream to drive. Rear camera very helpful in parallel parking and in exiting parking lots. The water bottle storage in the doors was easy access and convienent. Air conditioning throughout the whole car was effictive. Access to rear seats challenging but once seated, very comfortable. Great car for a great trip.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dynamic look. Stable at high speeds. Water bottle storage in doors a great idea. Sirius radio great on long trip without any local stations around. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the car but am so disappointed that with a Britax diplomat infant rear-facing seat (one of the smallet, most narrow on the market) installed in the center position (the safest), I can only use one of the two adjacent seats. The other is unusable because you cannot access the seat belt buckle! Even in my old A6 wagon this was not a problem. Further, with a carseat in the center location, it is impossible to move the seats forward to access the third row. You can move the carseat to the left or right but then your two rear passengers (imagine grandma and grandpa) are squished together and the one in the center has a very small seat. This is a silly problem to have in an SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love everything but the carseat issue. I suggest you try your carseat(s) before you buy this car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>OK. Here we go. How do we make the case to not lease our fourth minivan in over ten years? Currently three children 10, 7 and 5. Get the whole family in the van and go visit the Q7. You won't regret it I promise. I know we need all that space and cupholders, but still just go check it out...you deserve it! Maybe, just maybe, the kids can sacrifice a little for mom and dad. Afterall, this vehicle has everything you need to survive as a family of five and it performs, looks and rides like no minivan I've ever owned in the the last ten years. I drive a BMW 5 series so this is for my wife. But, this vehicle alone has made me consider an Audi for myself.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I have to say the back up camera, panorama sunroof, mmi system, third row seat comfort and those 20" wheels with all season tires for all year beauty.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Shopped for while... Mercedes, BMW... test drove all. All great but Q7 won. Special ordered, S-line, adaptive cruse and adaptive suspension together was worth waiting for. Love line assist and parking assist system. Bought 16GB USB drive and have all my favorite music at my steering wheel controls. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Adaptive cruise control, adaptive air suspension, MMI with USB connection.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased this vehicle for my wife because of increased need for space but without the minivan appearance. It has been a pleasure to drive with good handling (minimal body roll) and reasonable acceleration for the class of car. (I drive an RS4 and still enjoy the Q7). The ride can be rough, however, especially at lower speeds -- some likely related to 20" wheels that were a part of the s-line package. Wish the air suspension was an option on the 3.6 which would likely improve ride quality. Gas mileage is reasonable with the 3.6 (21mpg at 70 mph) given size/wt of vehicle. I'm willing to take 5-7 mpg hit over a minivan for the sportier ride and appearance.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice exterior appearance with s-line (especially 20" five spoke wheels which a very easy to clean). The car is unique appearing vehicle. Interior layout and space. MMI and quality of Bose surround sound. Panorama sunroof. Steering wheel mounted controls</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had an 02 and 05 X5 but needed something larger. Now have 3000 miles and no problems. Love the S-Line option but Audi takes 2 points off the residual value for leases which doesn't seem fair when you pay more.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy, backup camera and parking assist, S-Line appearance, wheels, steering wheel. Large moonroof (option) with shade that still leaves some light come thru. Sharp looking exterior, MMI interface. Blue tooth and steering wheel phone controls</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my Q7 4.2 premium s line for about 3 weeks. I just came back from a trip to North Carolina and I am in love. I think that the best feature hands down is the lane assist; it makes everything easier and you always are aware of your surroundings. I have owned an ML, X5, Range Rover, Escalade, 4 runner, Montero, and I don't regret or miss anything from those vehicles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving a bulky Expedition for 5 years, I really wanted a car. But with kids and lots of carpooling, a car was out of the question. I really needed 3rd row seating. My quest was to find an SUV that handled like a car. After lots of test drives, nothing compared to driving the Audi Q7. It was actually fun to drive! The all wheel drive makes turning ratios a breeze. I bought the 4.2 L and wow can it go! I love the MMI (takes a few hours to get used to but it is a great system). Seats are very comfortable, 2nd row seat huge, 3rd row I can sit in comfortably (I'm 5'6"). Interior is so cool at night with lots of red lights. The huge sunroof is a must. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drives like a car, can shift down to "sport" mode and take off, MMI interface was easy to use, very luxurious, 2nd row very roomy, sound system rocks, phone intergration was a breeze, iPod automatically shows all of your music on MMI, automatic tailgate, beautiful SUV that gets tons of compliments!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my Q7 for a few weeks now and I couldn't be more impressed with it. The ride, design, and comfort is unsurpassed. Being a technophile, this vehicle leaves you asking for no more. The iPod/iPhone interface is seamless, the navigation is easy to use and the overall MMI provides you with any information you could ask for. I selected the adaptive air suspension option, and that has turned out to be a great option, giving the car an adjustable ride, depending on the conditions. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride, comfort, technology, bluetooth, iPhone interface. The sound system is also fantastic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned a Volvo XC90 AWD since 2004 and I was looking for a change. I narrowed my choices down to the BMW X5, Land Rover and the Audi Q7. After many back-to-back-to-back test drives I bought the Q7 and I have never looked back! This car continues to impress and amaze me with it's effortless driving and sumptuous interior... this is my first Audi and it won't be my last. The MMI system works great (much better than the iDrive in my wife's BMW 3 series) and the advanced parking system makes short work of tight parking spaces.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort, power, room, quietness, MMI interface makes using all of the cars features EASY, sound system is fantastic, easy iPhone integration through the MMI, easy Bluetooth connection.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first return to a German car in 6 years. This car feels rock solid. The handling and seating position makes for comfortable commutes on DC's Capital Beltway. The parking sensors and rear backup camera are great. The MMI and nav. system takes some setup and getting used to, but once you've mastered it, it is quick and convenient. The 6 speed auto delivers on its promises. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The panorama sunroof, parking assistance features, handling, and fantastic interior design quality and build. Great lighting scheme, inside and out. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I rented a 07 3.6 for two weeks in March. The ride is much smoother, handling not as stiff, brakes not as touchy compared to the 07 I rented. The standard front sensors and rear parking camera are incredible. The slight front bucket seats are very comfortable. The standard 20 inch wheels are a great touch at medium and high speeds but a little rigid at speeds below 45mph. Better off with these 20s than the 19s or 18s when it comes to handling.The acceleration, S turn capability, ride are perfect. Stereo system doesn't get any better. For driving around town, I suggest getting the 3.6. Second row leg room would better for a SUV of this size. A Plus grade over all.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear parking camera, front parking sensors, stereo system, and acceleration, perfect metallic finish, driver visibility, plush leather interior, sports sedan like handling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 08 has front and rear parking sensors which are perfect addition. The front seats have a slight bucket which is also new. The MMI is very easy to use but have to agree with others that the nav. system takes getting used too. The handling and acceleration are incredible, taking hard S turns in the Q7 is a lot of fun. The brakes aren't as sensitive as the 07's. The 20 inch wheels are also standard. The ride with these at lower speeds is a little noisy but over 45 it's smooth sailing. Better to have these 20s than have the 18s or 19s with less handing. This Q7 needs to be driven hard on the highways or along coastal or mountain passes. This is not a putt around town SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power. Braking. Handling. Style. MMI/sound system. Comfort. Driver seat visibility, front and rear parking sensors. Amazing exterior detail (paint finish is A plus). My Q7 has gotten a lot of compliments (it is a real head turner). Rims and 20 inch wheels. The leather and real wood interior detail.</FAVORITE>
