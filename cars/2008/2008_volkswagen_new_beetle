<TEXT>I wanted this car for a long time before my husband bought this one for me as a surprise Christmas gift in 2007. It is so easy to drive, and the seats are a good fit for me. I have the automatic, so the gas mileage isn't the best, but I really love the experience of driving it every day. This is the best car purchase we have ever had and I will likely own this car the rest of it's life!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The New Beetle is so distinctive and the salsa red really gets everyones attention. I just love the way it looks!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife's 08 beetle has been pretty great. its a fairly smooth riding car (an impressive feat considering its based of the mkIV platform and thus has a torsion beam rear suspension) and is a a great long distance cruiser. the stock tires are not the greatest and in typical stock fashion has grown loud and tiresome, but the car itself is very quiet, peppy with great low end tq, and style my wife loves.(and i actually don't mind it either.)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>great shade of red, solid tuetonic driving experience, great highway cruiser, good range on gas tank, fairly inexpensive to maintain, decent steering feel, low end torque, engine growl.</FAVORITE>

<FAVORITE>The heated front seats, great on cold mornings or just to ride with top down on cool days. Harvest moon beige, cream top with cream interior is just a fabulous color combination. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Day one from picking up the car from the dealer the handbrake came off when I parked. The car doesn't feel at all like a German car, in fact it feels like it's coming apart. About 2 months later on my way home (45 min. commute) on a very hot Summer day, the underneath engine cover came loose fell off and broke into many pieces. When I took it to the dealer, they accused me of running into something and refused to fix it. The service manager even went through the trouble of fabricating a story that I ran over a parking turtarrier with a piece of rebar sticking out tearing the cover off and again refused. Both their customer service and chairman of the board also refused to help </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>At this point I'm disgusted with the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the yellow SE in July and have been driving it everyday just smiling. The handling is great,and the seats are comfortable. I just love all the fun it is to simply go anywhere now in my new "Sunflower Yellow" bug. Gets tons of compliments and fits in the smallest spots. I updated mine with "daisy" steering wheel covers, flower vase, license plate, and seat covers for an even cuter look.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The way it handles, so smooth and secure, the color, and the shape of the car. The gas mileage is average esp. since it contains 6 airbags and has a big engine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased a 2008 "S" with automatic about 3 months ago for my wife, with the intent of passing it on to our daughter next year. I was reluctant to purchase this car based on customer reviews of previous model years. I should have listened, because this piece of junk has been in the shop 4 times to fix various squeaks and rattles and we haven't even had the first oil change yet. So far gas mileage has been in the 22-24 mpg range, mostly suburban driving. While it's within the EPA estimates, it's still low for a car this small. Did I mention that it requires synthetic oil and a filter not carried at any quick lube establishments? </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's a cute car and my wife gets lots of compliments on it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Nice fun car - gas mileage could be somewhat better. The triple white model is really fun. I like the solid feel of the way it drives - tight. I especially like the blinker system where the blinker is also on the outside mirrors. Outside lighting of the car is well done as well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Blinkers and the so-called leather seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought a beautiful black with cream interior SE model a few weeks ago. Purchased this mainly for my daughters to drive, although I have to admit the old man likes it too! Haven't had a VW for a number of years, but they were always a fun car to drive, and this convertible is no exception. The SE comes with a power top, so makes it much easier for raising and lowering the roof. The car has plenty of pep and the Tiptronic 6 speed manual / automatic transmission is a pleasure. I also like being able to set it to "sport mode", where the transmission holds the shift pattern to higher RPM setting. Good handling as a touring vehicle and sure stopping brakes. Great little car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tiptronic 6 speed transmission is great, power top, comfortable seats. This car came with a beautiful Monsoon stereo, which included a CD player as well as satellite (Sirius) radio. Have a Sirius satellite radio in another car, and got this hooked up right away - great sound!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a fun, stylish car that is a "blast from the past"! It has the classic Beetle lines with the luxury of a Mercedes. This car is fun to drive, inexpensive to operate - I have been getting 33 - 35 MPG - but the AC kills the mileage - down to about 24 MPG with the AC running). It has lots of "get up and go" with acceleration onto highways rapid and sure. Interior space is great - I am 6'1" and fit quite comfortably in the back seat. I had two Mazda MX-5s prior to this VW and the VW wins hands down - for value, for comfort, with comparable handling and VERY much better when the roads are slippery. This is a delightful car - My wife liked it so much, she bought one for herself! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Tiptronic is great for someone who drove a stick all his life - the convenience of an automatic with the fun of a stick. The dash read-outs are plain and simple with colors that are easy on the eyes. I was able to get my choice colors, and the finish is great. All around great car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My mother went and bought this car for her Birthday and we have loved every cotton-pickin' minute of having it. It gets pretty good gas mileage. You would think that a small car like the Beetle-bug would be really tiny in the backseat, but it is really comfortable.It is the best car that our family has ever had. I also think it is really cool to have a car that there are only 1,400 of in the whole United States. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>One of our favorite features probably is going to be is the moon roof. You can adjust it to your favorite way. So it doesn't have to be fully open or fully closed!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first beetle was purchased in 1966 that was a great car but this one is even better. I drive 150 miles a day back and forth from work. The comfort and ride are exceptional and the car actually has a passing gear. The car has excellent pick up and I am experiencing a little over 30 mpg. I get a lot of looks and have referred many to the dealership. Thanks for providing such a wonderful vehicle it is what I need and also fun.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car has the ability to get up to 70 mph very quickly and has no loss of power with A/C on. It is very easy to put the rear seat down for additional cargo space. The cruise control is the best I have had on any car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I gave my 2004 Toyota Camry to my son and I purchased a Red Beetle with a Black top. I have owned my car for two months and I just love it. I shopped around for a convertible car that is fun to drive. The New Beetle is perfect. The gas mileage is not as good but is so much more fun to drive. My husband is a large guy over six feet tall. He has enough room in this car but back seats are for small children. He was not sure about a small car but he fell in love with it too. When I was sixteen my Dad had one of the old beetles they have made alot of improvements. Great job VW. People stop me all the time and tell me how much they like my car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats and how the car looks with the top down. Radio sounds great even with top down.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned 6 Beetles in my lifetime and I have loved everyone from my 1968 to my 2005. I recently traded in my 2005 and upgraded to a 2008. What a shock. The appearance and features are all basically the same as all my other New Beetles, however, the gas mileage is another story. I have paid more for gas than I have in payments for this car since I purchased it. It is only averaging 200 miles per tank of gas. I have had it to the dealership for service, and they insist that there is no problem with it. My last full tank of gas I got 193 miles. I am certain that there is a problem with the 2008 Beetle fuel system. I am not happy with the 08 VW. YUCK!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature would have to be the heated seats. Love them!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I shopped for a small car that was comfortable and has good visibility in all directions, VW won. This car looks small from the outside, not so when you get in. With tilt and telescopic steering wheel and three way adjustable seats, comfort comes easily, making entry and exit a breeze. Tiptronic is fun, the heated seats are hot, 6-disc CD changer/Sirius is cool, 17" low profile tires give it a great look. Lots of head room too. I got triple-white and love it. I threw out the flower holder.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort, radio, tiptronic, interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded a 2004 VW Touareg for this conv. I love my new Beetle. I got the triple black model. It gets attention everywhere I go. The 150 HP engine has enough juice to move. It would be nice if they had a turbo. Maybe they will come out with a sport model. I miss all the comfort features that the Touareg had. Power seats and lumbar would be nice. Also a nav system. I ride hard all the time so fuel economy is not the best. No this car is lots of fun to drive. It beats my Touareg in that department. Having a rag top is awesome. That is the main reason why I got my new convertible. It needs some nicer wheels. I'll be investing in some chrome wheels soon to bring out the bold looks on this bug!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The semi top. It not only works great, but looks very cool when it is down. It has that Cali look. I also love the bold looks of this bug. It can be considered cute or bold looking depending on how you trick it out. </FAVORITE>
