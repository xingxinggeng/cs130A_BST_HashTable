<TEXT>I was looking for a nice truck that was fully loaded, but wasn't too large. After comparing all of the models available, I noticed that the smaller, almost car-sized trucks were comparable to price of the Dakota. After taking it for a quick test drive, I immediately noticed that the V6 Magnum had the power that could be used if needed. Great interior - almost nice enough to be considered luxury - and all the features you could ask for. Great ride all in all. I average 18-22mpg combined, which isn't too bad for a truck this size. Towed my 16 foot, 1500lb boat with no effort. Nice stock stereo system. New design for the exterior makes the truck look much nicer. Great truck for the money!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior and exterior looks. Extended cab is nice for storing - no need for toolbox in bed. Comfortable ride. Wouldn't mind taking it on long trips. Powerful V6. Just an overall great truck. Wouldn't change it.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Nice Truck</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I wanted a truck that wasn't too big, but had enough grunt to work. Love the space the crew cab gives, wish the bed was about 1' longer. 4.7 V-8 is a great engine in search of a decent transmission. Very slow to down shift, yet won't up-shift in parking lots. 4X4 knob is in a poor location. Ride is a bit too stiff--the 07 was too soft. Handling is terrific for a truck, but I would trade a bit of handling for a less stiff ride. So far 14 mpg city 21 mpg highway, pretty decent for a 300+ HP V-8 4X4. Overall head and shoulders above the Ranger and Colorado, better looking than Toyota and Nissan. Best mid-sized truck out there</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable seats, V-8 has plenty of power and is smooth and quiet. Perfect size, roomy interior, neat storage bins under rear seat. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I reseached this purchase before spending $27K, and nothing compared to the value received in the Dakota. Oh yes, all the magazines love Toyota and Nissan, however, these same magazines receive a heck of a lot more incentives from these manufacturers for the positive take. This Dodge is every bit as good, more powerful, more capable and better looking. Take advantage of all the incentives, compare, and you'll come to the same conclusion---Buy it! You won't be sorry.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powerful V8, interior room, comfortable/quiet, towing capability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd truck in 5 years, and I must say my favorite. I bought the v6 because I drive so much and its better on gas. Love the looks of this truck, and the interior is like a luxury car. Never liked the exterior of the Dakota till the 08 came out. They are giving 08's away, mine was 10k off MSRP. The quad cab is very roomy, drives and handles way better than my 06 Titan. This is the top of the small truck class. I looked at and test drove a Canyon Z71 and a Nismo Frontier, and I was surprised that I liked The Dakota so much better. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Big Horn edition looks are amazing. Love the interior seating, back seats fold up to reveal storage slots, awesome feature. The front end is a much better improvement from Dakota's of past. Bluetooth standard is pretty cool.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Great Value</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I was in the market for a pick-up and researched for a year. Settled on the Dodge Dakota with V8. I like the size and power. Meets my needs for a vehicle that supports my fly fishing, weekend camping, towing small trailer. I bought for Sport Crew Cab with V8 for $26,800, freight and tax included. Sticker was close to $34K. Bought at $1000 under invoice, plus Dodge is offering factory $5000 rebate on 08 Crew Cabs.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Not too big, not too small. Great V8 power. 310 HP, 329 lbs of torque. Yet I'm getting 18 mpg on highway, which is not bad for a V8. Note that 2008 V8 has 2 spark plugs per cylinder, and gets as good as mileage as most V6s. Go for the power, baby! Heated seats are great. MyGig stereo with VR</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having done the research for a bigger engine to pull with, I decided on the SLT, V8, 4WD with 4 doors. Like the new design for exterior, and upsized engine. Lots of power, and average MPG is around 17.5 with the auto. transmission. First thing I noticed was trailer lights not working properly. A computer glich. This turned out to be a small recall. The truck came with a trailer harness when purchased. Now the blower motor quit and the interior lights. A wiring cluster behind the dash for the odometer has my HVAC wiring running through it. Why would they run a 40 amp fan through this? I've been driving Toyotas since 1983. Considering going back to Toyota before my warranty expires. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just picked up my 08 Dakota. Turned in a Ram for this little beauty. Very impressed with the looks, interior, and drive-ability of this truck. This is a very capable truck in a smaller package. Very easy for the wife to maneuver in traffic. Vehicle fit and finish is excellent. Better on gas than my old Hemi. Interior is very quite and the upgraded stereo is very crisp and clear. Really like the Sirius radio option. Had an issue finding room to store all my gear from the Ram. Solved by mounting on of the collapse-able bins from interior to the truck bed with sheet metal screws.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Originally was going to get the 07 at the end of the year. But after hearing about the new V8 I waited. I was not disappointed, power is very good. MPG could be better but is OK at about 16.5 average. I like all the storage, but dash looks and feels like cheap hard plastic. Cab has a lot of wind noise, but with stereo on it is not noticeable. Ride is stiff and bouncy, very noticeable while going around a turn with bumps, feels like the back end is going to lose traction. I have the Sport and it should have been set up to look sportier like the Colorado with a lowered stance. Front seat only holds 2 people while my older model holds 3, 3 would be better. Stock rear tinted windows are dark.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V8 is awesome, might be faster than the Hemi in the Ram due to the Ram being a 1000 LBS more. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My truck is actually a Sport w/V-8, crew cab. This is my 3rd Dakota. So far, my favorite. It's red, fast, looks sporty, handles great, rides good, doors open wide, seats firm and supportive, tows, looks good anywhere, best warranty of anyone. Traded down from full-size Chevy. Like this better. Easier to get in and out of and wife likes the size. Mileage is 21-24 on highway driving sensibly. City is lower of course. Acceleration is matched by nothing else is its' class. Brakes and transmission work flawlessly. When you turn on your truck, does it return the favor? Mine does!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Did some research on this truck and the ratings I read are true. My mpg on highway at 71 mph at 65 degrees, little wind, is around 19 mpg the truck had 65 miles on it. The V8 has some good power. Got the Laramie package with the trailer tow package. Truck pulls 3000 lbs real good. Love the black metal flake paint with the chrome front end looks like a Harley truck. Truck gets a lot of looks, Dodge did a good job on redesigning the front clip. Ride is pretty good for a pickup truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After having a Honda, and a Toyota, I find my new Dakota to be their equal in terms of build quality. In fact I drove a Ridgeline, and a Tacoma on the same day I drove the Dakota, and the Dakota blew them away in terms of quietness and ride quality. The 08 interior is an upgrade from the previous year. I have the V8 which I need for towing, and so far MPG is not the greatest (14 around town,18 HWY) but it should improve once it breaks in and the weather gets warmer. The new engine has a lot of guts and will serve my needs very well. So far I love my truck</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I bought the Laramie with the tow package. I like the heated seats, and the remote start has been a blessing in this cold winter</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I looked at all th mid/small pickups. My father-in-law owns a Colorado. I have driven many of my friends' pickups and none compare to the Dakota. Better ride and definitely more fun to drive. The new redesigned suspension is a bit stiff, giving it a tighter feel, but it is still better than the Nissan, Chevy, and the Ford. The Toyota rides a little better, but the Dakota, even with the V-6 Auto has better passing ability. Gas mileage is OK, I am getting about 22-23 MPG in mixed driving. Overall, I am very pleased I chose this truck and I look forward to many years of enjoy my time behind the wheel. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It has a firm, borderline stiff ride, much less spongy than the previous model years. We have many 2006-07's in our fleet and you can tell the difference. The console and cup holder layout is great and much improved. All controls are easy to reach and use. The ride is quiet. I would recommend the V8 if you need serious power. So far, my 3.7L accelerates good enough and maintains highway speeds adequately. We have had very few quality issues in our fleet so far with Dakotas, and hopefully this series will even be better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The rear storage baskets are collapsible and are a neat feature. The cargo rails w/moveable tie downs are a long-overdue improvement. YES fabrics are nice feature and are easy to clean up, especially good for fleet use.</FAVORITE>
