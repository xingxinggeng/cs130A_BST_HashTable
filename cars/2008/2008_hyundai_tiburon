<TEXT>Absolutely love this car! Quick, sexy, stylish, just over all this car stuns people. Could use more power but hey its a four cylinder. Almost beat my roommates El Camino with this car. I've been rear ended with this car twice and both times there was no damage just some scratches where the license plate lights are. This car drives like a dream. My only regret...well sort of, was not getting the V-6 model but i'm still happy with my four.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my Tiburon SE one week ago. The prices that they are selling these things for is crazy, mine is a brand new 2008 SE with 22 miles on it when I drove it off the lot, all for only $16,000. I sold my 2008 Accent SE and bought the Tiburon. It has a sports tuned suspension which makes it very stiff but handles well, interior is very nice with leather and cloth, nice dash layout, but the car does sit very low and so will you when driven. The exterior is outstanding, looks great, nice lines, dule exhaust, projector head lights, 17" wheels, and it all comes with the best warranty in the business, mine has the remaining 4 years which is still better than GM or Ford.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought a black on black V-6 with 9,000 miles on it. This car is SO awesome. It is fun to drive, handles great and looks so much more expensive than what I paid. People flip out over it, when I stop at a red light, everyone in the cars around me check it out. I am even getting pretty good gas mileage. I like the Tiburon so much better than the new Genesis Coupe. This car was really hard to find. I found a new one in my area, but the dealer sold it before I got a chance to buy it. I was lucky to find this one with low mileage at a great price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the tiburon sight unseen 3 months ago. I was pleasantly surprised by almost everything about this car. Although the backseat is tiiiny, it has comfortable front seats, agreat look, easy to drive and all the features I wanted. I was in an accident 2 weeks ago that totaled the car (flipped it). I walked away with a scratch on my foot. Fantastic car... really! My only complaints are: size of backseat, pretty big blind spot, a bit bumpy on older roads Highly recommended... especially after the wreck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this 2008 used in 2009 a week ago with 40 (forty) miles on the odometer. What a steal!!! The car is sporty/fun/economical. Anyone driving this car that is over 6'1" might not have enough headroom. I got the GT LTD, and it has plenty of power, and being front wheel drive it seems to have more power than I need. The price cannot beat, and the GPS,Stereo,Auto Air conditioning are all great features that came with car. I highly recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am just so used to my Toyotas that the quality of this car just stinks in comparison. The consul is already scratched up, it rides really rough. It jerks and feels like it is out of balance but the dealer says it is not. It looks like it has some power but it doesn't at all. I will never buy another Hyunai car again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I now have over 1200 miles on my Tiburon, and thought I'd give an update. I finally broke in the engine, and starting at about 500 miles, my usable power increased dramatically. The engine now responds much more quickly when I hit the accelerator. The car is listed at 17 mpg in the city. That is what I get. It is listed at 23 mpg on the highway, but on a recent trip I got over 30 mpg at 75 mph. I still wish the GT Limited had an available 6-speed manual, or at least a 5-speed auto.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought this car a week ago, so keep that in mind. I immediately took a 200 mile trip. The seats are fantastic! Very comfortable. I have a bad back, and my back did not hurt at all. The ride is surprisingly smooth, especially given the low-profile tires. The 4-speed manual is not real sporty, and acceleration is not blazing. The engine sound on acceleration is sweet. There is a lot of room under the hatch. The rear seat is for children only, but holds a booster seat comfortably. If you want quicker response and acceleration, try the SE with 6-speed manual. I drove it, and it was smooth with great pick- up. I only got the Limited because my son will learn to drive on this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car since March and have to say it is a fun little car. First, the engine lacks a great deal of power. I do a lot of highway driving, and the on-ramps kill me with how slow the car picks up speed. 138hp is not enough for the car. While the car is fun to drive on streets for the most part, it's pick up is just ridiculous. Looks wise, the rear-end of the car is great but the front just looks old-school Hyundai. The headlight revision is an improvement but not much more. I expected fuel efficiency to be a bit better considering it was a 138bhp 2.0L engine. Interior is awesome. The "subwoofer" is cheap and rattles too much. Seats are great, but don't sit on your wallet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 08 Tiburon really caught my eye. This was not the Tiburon of yesteryear. It fills the void of an econo sportscar very well. People have asked me what kind of car is it and they are surprised to find out it is a Hyundai. I have an Elantra, which I am pleased with, and had high expectations for the Tiburon. It is what I expected it to be and have been quite satisfied so far. My buddy has a 3-series Bimmer and I can't help rub it in that my car is less than half the cost of his car and looks just as good!</TEXT>

Great on corners, smooth ride and has comfortable interior, use to have an elantra but I am enjoying new ride.

<TEXT>I have had this car for over a month and even though that's not a long time I can't help myself but write a review. The car is pretty quick, not fast but quick for a daily driver. I like the interior design also over something like the Mitsubishi Eclipse and Chevy Colbalt. It looks unbelievable at night too. All in all it's a great car but the engine should be able to put out more power stock. Nothing a little aftermarket support can't fix though :).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Only a few 2008s left for sale in Southern California: only 100 left for sale in USA. Purchased the six cylinder because don't want loss of power with AC on. Dealer gave huge discount off sticker and low 2.9% financing. This car is a bunch of fun to drive, my wife loves it, even though there are physical adjustments with seat, mirrors instead of all automatic features. The Kenwood radio is great sounding and the AC will literally blow you away. I like the sport seats too. Needless to say, it is the exterior styling that recommends the car most. The interior lighting is exciting and I opted for BlueTooth connectivity rather than sunroof, which I never use. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exciting exterior look, red safety light in doors, tightness of steering, good braking. Trunk is good size, and fold down rear seats make for even more carrying capacity.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned both the Tiburon GS and SE. Though I loved the GS for its fuel economy and affordable pricing, the SE surpasses it by miles. I noticed that the only negative reviews about the Tiburon are from owners of the base trim; all I can say is that you get what you pay for! Though I prefer a good old fashioned American V8, the six speed manual transmission that comes standard on the SE makes the most of the 180 horsepower offered by this V8. This car FLIES and the upgraded suspension and brakes(better than the GT) make this car a blast to drive on the back roads! Not to mention - the SE tops out around 150. Hyundai always has and always will make the most car for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just recently purchased my 2008 GS and I am very impressed with its appearances, and the smooth shifting 5 speed manual transmission. However, I have driven many manual cars, a Mustang Cobra, Jeep Wrangler, Camaro Z28, Honda Civic, and an Eclipse GSX; I have NEVER driven a car with such a weak clutch. The clutch seems to ruin the good fun of the car for me, however when it goes bad I plan on upgrading to a stage 1 Clutch Master FX100, and there shouldn't be a problem with it. Overall, the Tib is a great car, and has a lot of potential. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a sporty car within the 16-20k price range.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature of the Tib is the interior styling, the black cloth interior is very attractive, as are the blue illuminated dash displays. I like the change of tail lights on the 07-08 models but the headlights are a bit less attractive than earlier tibs in my humble opinion</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you are going to buy a Tib stay away from the standard shift or you will regret it. My car has had to go in four times since I bought it. Twice for the clutch, once for a flywheel, and once for a snapped cable. The clutch will cost over a $1000 off warranty. I've been told privately by at least two different Hyndai mechanics that they are always replacing the clutches which are crap. The car is red, but it should be lemon yellow.</TEXT>

<TEXT>At first, I was attracted to the more powerful Civic Si, Scion tC, and the GTi from VW. The GTi and Si not being in my price range, I had to choose between the tC or Tiburon, which was very easy. The Tiburon GS is a great little coupe that looks a LOT better then most coupes in its price range. The Tiburon has a decent acceleration, and decent high-speed max. Handling is very good, and this car is also a good platform for the modding enthusiasts. The car is small, so its easy to maintain the exterior and interior.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The redesign of the headlights makes the new Tiburon look menacing, and the overall shape of the car goes with the headlights a lot better. The headlamps is projector lens, so you can install HID lighting. Chromed, dual exhausts looks sick, and makes a good sound, although a bit quiet.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>You're not going to get the styling & features for the money in any other car. My main complaint is I could use a little more headroom. The sun roof takes away some of the headroom. I'm used to driving cars in this price range & I have to say this is the sportiest car I've had in a long time. Gas mileage could be better. I don't think I get the mileage advertised. Seems like I don't get very far on a tank of gas. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When I first saw this car, I knew I had to have one. So I test drove and bought my Tiburon about a month ago. After driving a Jeep for two years and an Explorer for five years before that, I was ready to get back into a fun car. The Tiburon is just that - fun. Very smooth ride and decent acceleration for a 4 cylinder, though when the a/c is on, the power cut is noticeable. The five-speed transmission is a little stiff. Also, that blind spot took a little getting used to. And don't expect to give rides to anybody over about 5'-10", especially in the back seat. Face it, this is not a family car. However, it is a lot of fun for the buck. Oh, and despite fuel ratings, I average 25 city/34 hwy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sleek styling, punchiness, sheer amount of fun to drive, sunroof, five speed. Big enough trunk room for my guitar, amp, gigbag, and pedalboard. Tight steering. Decent acceleration for such a small engine except when the a/c is on.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Let's start with the advantages: its pricing, its fuel economy, and its lack of show-offyness. Pricing is very good for the Hyundai Tiburon GT limited edition, at just $17,000. Actually I sometimes think that it's a good buy. It's not a "fast car", but it's great for backroad bombing it works pretty well on the highway. Driving isn't considered fun, however. On the other hand, fuel economy is ok at 22mpg in the city and 28mpg on the highway. The car gets to 60mph in 8.0 seconds, which isn't impressive these days, but better than some cars of this Tiburon's price range. It's an acceptable car for its price range, and not too show-offy either, but Hyundai needs some improvements to the Tiburon</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great little car that my wife and I just bought after finishing college. We're very pleased, overall, with its performance. We've had Civics and Mustangs in the past and this Tiburon rates right up there. It doesn't handle nearly as well as a Civic Si, but it handles better (and is more fun to drive) than a Mustang.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car is beautiful inside and out; I'm particularly impressed with the classically-styled gauges (with "modern" blue interior lights) and the impressive cargo room that neither Civic or Mustang can come close to. The Kenwood stereo is really cool and Tiburons are an absolute blast to drive!</FAVORITE>

The I4 and 5 speed manual trans gets me going down the road very smartly and gets great gas mileage. I notice that people come up beside me on the freeway to take a double look to see what it is I'm driving. It's a real fun ride and I'd highly recommend it!!</TEXT>

I am really enjoying it and it's overall performance it plenty for me. Never thought I would want a sports [or in this case just sporty] car, but I'm glad I did.

<TEXT>I have only owned this vehicle for a short time, but I already love it. I love the exterior and interior design and the price tag was great too! It is sporty, and practical compared to some other sports cars, especially with gas prices being at 4.14 per gallon where I live. When most people first look at this car, it takes them a while to realize that it is a hyundai tiburon. In my opinion, it somewhat resembles a Maserati GranTurismo. Compared to my friends 2008 honda civic si coupe, this car is more solidly built and more pleasing to the eye inside and out. Overall, I love this car and would definitely recommend it!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior, dual exhaust, wheels(or as some people call them, rims) side mirrors, i love the front end of this car and side detailing. I like the partial leather seats because leather wears so fast, it looks sporty too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Tiburon GT, at minimum, is adequate in every area. It's ride is smooth and nimble. The experts claim that the handling is "numb", but I have found it to be the best handling car that I have ever driven.(That includes Acura TL, Acura CL, Honda Civic, Ford Taurus SHO, and Ford Mustang) The brakes are extremely responsive and took some getting use to. The engine is a little weak, considering it is a V6 with 172 HP, but it will give enough pep for realistic driving. I have been extremely pleased with the gas mileage. Critics, and Hyundai themselves have posted 17/23 MPG, while I have been consistently getting 25-27 MPG when driving conservative. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I find the automatic climate control easy to use and equally effective. The cruise control is uniquely designed and easy to operate. The instrument panel is simple, yet very cool. The GT model comes with 17" alloy wheels that are really pleasing to the eye. Overall, the exterior design is superb!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just broke the 1000 mile mark over the weekend...I have owned this vehicle since Feb. 16. This car is really fun to drive, looks amazing inside and out, and has pretty much every feature you could want in a car. I love the Kenwood head unit. At night the car is beautifully lit up on the inside. I can't wait until my first long trip this summer to see how the highway gas mileage is. The car is a 4 cylinder but to me, its not that noticeable. A side note, this car comes with the "tiptronic steering" where you can somewhat experience driving a manual. I would recommend not using this feature...I have in the past in other vehicles and had to replace the transmission.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned 4 manual cars in my lifetime and have never had to replace a clutch until now. I have had to replace the clutch on my 2008 Tiburon 2 times already and it has come out of my pocket. Hyundai says the clutch is a normal wear and tear item and is not covered under warranty. My alternator went bad a month ago and hyundai took care of everything. If you buy this car get an Automatic or you will be kicking yourself later. The car is truly fun to drive and the redesigned headlights make it look great.</TEXT>
