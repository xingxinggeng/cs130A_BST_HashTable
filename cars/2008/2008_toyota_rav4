<TEXT>This is a great SUV. My first small SUV as previously owned Dodge truck and Durangos. Bought new 18 months ago for V6 w/ tow package. I tow a 19' boat (~3,500 towed weight) and all sorts of stuff in my cargo trailer. I have been very impressed with the towing! I don't miss my full size truck (trailer is easier to load) or the gas mileage. I included trailer brakes on the boat trailer and am glad I did as brakes are the only weak point of the RAV4. Roomy, reliable, fun to drive and competent towing makes me very happy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Zippy V6, Better than expected towing performance, great audio pkg (have added XM), lots of passenger and cargo room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have always wanted one and when I got rid of my echo I decided to go ahead and buy a rav4. I am 5'6 and I love it. The inside is roomy the radio does sound like its wheezing when the ipod is hooked up but oh well. I love this car and wouldn't trade it for anything. The lights in the trunk don't bother me and my seats do fold completely flat. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The storage in the trunk its great for cold items, the ipod jack is hidden so you don't have to have your ipod on display.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Rav 4. After a brutal northeast winter I had to get a reliable, sturdy car and fell in love with the Rav 4 on first site. It's a lot of fun to drive and with all the bells and whistles, I can't wait for winter. Even without the V-6 component, the 2.4 liter engine still moves like a rocket. Loving the Ipod Jack and the bluetooth features from the steering wheel- awesome!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Throughout 25,000 miles in 1 year, 24 mpg w/V6 in a metro city is great while my 4-cyl '06 PT Cruiser gets less than 18. The V6 and a comparable large rear window is the reason Toyota got my green. The turning radius surpasses my smaller Cruiser's. As you can tell, my practical focus is on safety, function, and economy. My wife's preference is style and speed. With the Rav, we get both. Researching options and reports, Toyota seems to exceed American auto-makers for trouble-free longevity. My wife (5'3") and I (6'2") both ride in stable comfort whether driving or riding. Leg and cargo room are ample and head room abounds in front & rear seats. Acceleration? Pray and fly with angelic speed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powerful V6, ample interior space, fuel economy, turning radius, exterior styling, cargo area rear-seat releases, below-deck cargo storage, dual climate controls, rear-door mounted full-sized spared tire (Thanks, Toyota, for not making me lie on the ground while unapologetic, 80- mph cars whiz by).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Lots of pluses for this "little" Toyota (our first new car was a '71 Corolla, now THAT was little!). Traded in a 96 4Runner with the same engine, and we're blown away by the performance difference. 4Runner wasn't a slouch, but the RAV4 is a hottie. Even driving it hard on trips, we're getting 26.5-28.5 mpg on the road, which is dang good; best we ever got with the old truck was 18.5. My wife likes the way the hood slopes down; says she can see more of the road up front. I'm 6'5" and although it isn't what I'd call roomy, the RAV4 is adequately sized; we took a 9-hour road trip with 5 in the car (2 seater) and all came back still speaking. A miracle! Never feels like a truck will blow us away.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Me: strong engine, xlnt finish, great gas mileage, solid "car" feel, sound system, 4W-dr stability, good visibility, roomy. Wife: Engine, heated lthr seats, mileage, safety features, visibility, dependability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At 1 year old, I still love my Rav 4. The Barcelona red color is gorgeous. I would buy it again. My parents want one in 4WD for the mountains. Test drove the Mitsubishi Outlander but the Rav 4 blew it away in performance and quality. I ordered the bumper guard to protect the very deep rear bumper and the vinyl cargo tray. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this SUV. I had a jeep and traded for this for fuel economy. I averaged over 26 mph on a 1000 mile trip. I don't like the excess engine noise when cold. Seats are hard but for a smaller person comfortable. Performance is better than Pontiac gt with 3.8. Some wind noise but have a Lexus also and it's quiet. Great steering response in the mountains where I live. Corners not a problem. I got a lifetime drivetrain warranty from the dealer for free as long as he does the service. </TEXT>

<TEXT>If you want to stay warm in winter while riding in the second or third row seat, I suggest buying another vehicle. Other than that, the RAV 4 is a great little car -- especially with the V6. I've had the dealership tear the vehicle down looking for the reason why there is no heat coming from the ducts in the second and third row seats. Their final verdict -- verified by Toyota's engineers -- the system is functioning as designed. Since I live in Wisconsin, going with a marginal heater is not an option. Toyota's suggestion -- trade it in for something that has heat but I take the loss on the vehicle -- about a $3-4K hit. Pretty rotten on Toyota's part but they know I have no choice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V6 engine (very nice), just about everything else is good except the heater.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>No surprises with the RAV4. I dove into this purchase with extensive research, and optioned it precisely to suit my family's needs (well, mostly my needs): Limited, V6, 4wd, leather, JBL, 3rd row, tow package. On paper, it's exactly what a family of 5 needs to motor about the local area (with three kids in car seats) in a bit of style. What this vehicle lacks (unbeknownst to the spec-sheet analyst) is any serious personality. It's fast, but handles like a van. It's a suitable light-medium duty tow vehicle; I frequently tow a 2,000 lb enclosed trailer and barely know it's there. The interior is laid out fine. Exteriorwise, the front is nice, but the back bumper is just plain ugly.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powerful V6, almost too powerful for the suspension. Leather seats are firm, but comfortable. 3rd row seats flip up individually, so you can still transport a large, long item with three kids still seated by flipping down only one side of the middle and 3rd row. Note the 3rd row is only for kids.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought 2008 rav v6 limited 4wd in august 2008. Vibrations at 80 km/hrs. 4x4 assembly was changed but did not solve problem. Finally replace the drive shaft. Now it's fun to drive. Noise isolation is bad particularly in the back. Seats are not comfortable. Very hard. Other then that it's a great car and VERY performant.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car in early October and have already hit 5000 very enjoyable miles. We've run from NYC to Boston and back twice, one of those trips in the thick of the recent snowstorm. The AWD plowed through several inches of fresh snow (the electronic AWD lock being a very useful feature when the plows haven't come through yet). Having a V6 gives added confidence, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this car. I'm 6'2" and quite comfortable up front. I have 4 kids under age 7, so the optional third row gets used at weekends. It's a little tight back there - cargo space pretty much disappears with the third row up & in use. When the kids are older we'll go for a Sienna. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD is handy in the snowy northeast, very peppy V6, surprisingly roomy interior with the 3rd row stowed into the floor. The optional 3rd row works well with young kids but *one* adult can't really sit back there for more than short trips. Gas mileage is about 24mpg combined town/highway.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased in Nov 2007 and simply love driving my new 2008 RAV4. I'm amazed at how agile and fun this thing drives. It's like driving a peppy little sports car that sits high off the ground. The vehicle is well engineered and the traction control and 4wd provide impressive handling in the snow. The only downside I see to the vehicle is somewhat lower mileage than I had hoped for/expected. I get around 23-24 mpg on mixed city/highway driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car drives like a dream and is very comfortable. The V6 provides tons of zip - very peppy. Bluetooth works very well. I like the side-opening rear gate. Test drove the car and it rode rough. I found the tires over-inflated - lowering pressure fixed the problem. The car is quiet and handles better than our '05 Highlander. After 1000 mi., I'm quite happy with this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Limited V6 for a week and about 600 miles. It's been smooth and agile on the two trips I've taken. Plenty of power to get around trucks and slower vehicles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Bluetooth is terrific! Luckily they set it up at the dealership, since I understand the pairing is the toughest thing. The voice-prompts make operation idiot-proof. Blizzard Pearl white looks terrific--it's like a different shade every time you look. Taupe leather interior also a must! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got my Rav4 yesterday, 2008 4 cyl base model with roof rail and 17" wheels. Today I added 250 miles on it through moutain roads and freeways. The 4 cyl responses quick and provides sufficient power. The enginee is not quiet but sounds sporty. Handling is fantastic for a SUV at this price. It actiually handels much better than many sedans i drove. The ride is a little bit stiff tho. I think it's the trade off of good handling. Interior space is bright, roomy and functional, the design and materials are nice but not the best in class. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Elegant and tougher (than CRV/Rogue) look. Impressive handling. Plenty storage space and fold down seat. Huge side-opening back door and back mounted spair tire.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Toyota. It's been a little over one month. The first week I couldn't believe my eyes. I got 400 miles on the first tanks. WOW! 25 mpg for bumper to bumper traffic. And then it went downhill from there. I am now lucky to get 300 per tank or 19 mpg. Cold weather this week, the back brakes are making a high pitched noise when stopping. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned the Rav4 for about 6 weeks and have almost 1800 miles. I have a 4WD limited, 4cyl. It runs smooth and quiet. When it switches gears, mine doesn't "clink" as a previous reviewer said. The 4cyl has more than enough oomph for basic driving. I'm not one for towing/hauling, so I didn't need the 6cyl. I like how the CD player reads MP3s. My previous car did not. I can get about 180 songs on a CD. However, the random function seems to play about the same 25 songs... not sure why. All in all happy with my purchase. If I could go back, I would still buy it again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very adjustable driver's seat. Smooth acceleration. Getting about 24.5 mpg city/highway combined. Dual climate control. Rear seat (2nd row) folds down to make a flat surface in back. Makes for a lot of room if needed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After lots of research, I traded in my Camry SE for the 2008 Limited, 4wd,4 cyl RAV I drove a V6 to compare, and it was fast, a quieter engine, but they didn't have the V6 available in the Limited. However, the 4cyl is peppy enough for me. From a dead stop it takes off with plenty of speed and for my commuting needs the 4cyl is fine. The overall feel of the car is super and spacious. I'm up much higher than in my Camry and I like that. I love the interior, the safety features and its a smooth drive. Wind noise is nil. I am very happy I bought this vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gorgeous Barcelona Red color; airbags/ 4wd provide security; good leg room; sporty look; nice lines; large cargo space with "privacy areas" for packages; radio controls in steering wheel; good radio, dual air control for driver and passenger, sun roof & sturdy rack. Love the rear door appearance.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After trading in my Xterra, I am very happy with my RAV4 Sport model. What impressed me was the tremendous acceleration of the V6, the safety features and the "on demand" 4WD system. No more locking in hubs or shifting into 4WD. It took a while getting use to the different configuration of the stick shift. There is good visibility out the front windshield due to the short angled hood. Road noise from the tires is apparent and is probably due to the brand of tires. The seats are not too comfortable on the Sport but these shortcomings are minor to me compared to my previous vehicle. The gas mileage is quite good although it needs more breakin to see more improvement.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hidden compartment under the floor boards. Skid plate over the vulnerable parts underneath. Black color looks great with the 18 inch aluminum wheels. The rear seats fold flat allowing me to sleep inside when camping out. Temperature display on dashboard is a nice feature. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Excellent Crossover</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Been owning for about a month now and put about 800 miles on it. All I can say is nothing but good impression of everything that comes with it. Plenty of power to fool around on the road, handling is just like a car, gas consumption is impressive for a 3500 lbs crossover SUV(got average of 21 miles/gal). Design of the interior is as good as sedan but too much plastic materials used. Toyota did a good job to fool your eyes (you'll think it's a leatherette from a distance). This is the reason why I took 1 point off the interior design evaluation points. I love how the exterior look, from the headlights(resembling BMW headlights) to the curve line on the sides, side mirrors, but weird rear-end.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sport suspension, auto-off headlights, roof rack, 18" wheels, electric power steering, 3.5L 269hp V6, 4WD, 5spd automatic, 3500 lbs towing capacity, supportive headrests, 1-touch power windows and roof, hidden compartments, dash design, good brakes, gas consumption, decent assist & stability control.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Totally surprised with the snap that this 4 cylinder engine has. Wife feels very safe in this car; have been in pickups the past 10 yrs and ready to downsize. Toyota quality and reliability brought me to the car; retiring next year and this is the sensible solution to fuel economy for a non hybrid. Plenty of nooks and crannies to put things, net assembly and cargo cover have out of the way place for storing. This car gets there now, no problem getting up to and over speed limits; runs so quite and handles so well you can be up to 80 mph before you realize it. I'm a big guy and the driver side is roomy and comfortable, selected the liqui-cell leather seats for my disabled lower back.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style, handling, Barcelona Red (candy apple red for us old guys) paint, roominess, quietness from road noise, unable to hear engine. A lot of research went into decision for new car and this is right choice for us.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased a new RAV4 Limited and absolutely love it. The drive is very quiet, the ride smooth and handling is great. I traded a Jeep Liberty and besides getting me out of my 300 ft driveway in 8" of snow, I loved the turning radius. It would turn on a dime getting into parking spots. The RAV does too. One of the reasons I bought the RAV was for the gas mileage. Of course anything is better on gas than the Liberty. I also wanted a RAV because of the safety features. We've had 2 Toyotas in our family and would have literally driven them into the ground; they were built so well. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a great SUV!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I'm probably one of a few people who like the side opening back door! Also like the foot lighting, the BT and the stereo system. There's plenty of big & little storage places. One of my main considerations is the safety features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I put in a lot of time and researched all the available makes and models, both hybrid and gas, that would satisfy my current needs. Based on the MPG, reliability, looks and price the RAV4 edged out the Honda CR-V. Now that I have had the car for several weeks I am thrilled that I decided on the RAV4. The V6 is surprisingly powerful and quick for the MPG that you actually get. We are averaging 25.3 MPG so far. The sport model has larger rims and tires with fender well moldings that really make a difference in the overall look of the vehicle. The interior is very well thought out and convenient. As I drive around and look at the other new cars on the road I'm very pleased with my purchase.</TEXT>

I find the V6 to be very smooth, and the cabin to be very quiet for an SUV. The leather seats are firm, but still comfortable. There is plenty of storage space, and easy access with the fold-down back seats. The options with the Limited are wonderful, and everything is easy to reach on the dash. The exterior is very sporty, and I love the new Savannah color. It is beautiful on this SUV. The safety features saved on my insurance. I added the exhaust tip, rear bumper applique, mudguards, and XM radio which is awesome with the premium 9 speakers! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought a 2008 Rav4 4cyl fwd, base model with a few extras. A friend has an 05 and loves it; another has one of the original Ravs and loves it. Something must have changed. You can really, really feel the road; very rough ride. Seats are very uncomfortable. The interior is new milenium plastic. The car has an unexplained "clink" on shifting, exceleration and braking. Burned plastic smell (like I picked up a plastic bag on the muffler - hope that goes away). Really disappointing ride</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I love this SUV... she calls it a rocket! With the 269 HP, it gets you going no matter what speed you are at. I tried the 4WD/AWD system and VSC this past snow storm and it didn't even flinch in 15" of snow, if you started going sideways, purposely or not, the VSC had you straight in 1 second. The interior is comfortable, roomy, and full of great extras. The sound system rocks with the JBL subwoofer. I tow a jet ski down on the beach with it and you can't even feel the ski back there. It could get a little better fuel mileage, but hey we are heavy on the pedal. 9500 miles into it and not one problem at all! Great SUV, highly recommend. Wish you could get 3rd row with leather.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my RAV4 for about 4 months and I like it a lot. The 4 cyl engine is amazing and the braking is the best I've ever had in a car. There are a lot of little extras which are nice. I have only two real complaints. The seat, while having a good lumbar support are quite uncomfortable. If you test drive be aware. The mileage is somewhat under the estimated mileage. My mixed city-highway is running between 18-21 mpg. Last, they should have had some heavy duty cover on the back bumper. It can easily get roughed up as you put things in the rear. They offer a little plastic cover, but it does not cover the critical area. This may have been fixed in the 2009 model. Great car-bad seats</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased the RAV specifically for gas mileage when the price per gallon was near $5. It has delivered high 20's on the road and around 20mpg in town. Ho-hum. The engine pulls like a freight train and easily tows up to the 3500# limit. Unfortunately, the engineers didn't sort out the torque steer problems under heavy acceleration, it can be very darty. Also, notice the acceleration rate keeps coming on even after I stop pushing on the gas any harder (like a turbo). We bought the Sport to get the darker interior, but the ride quality is too harsh for commuter style driving. And, worst for last, the AT has an irritating whine at 25-35 mph that is louder after warmed up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have put about 5000 miles on a lease/return since purchased 10/08 including about 1500 miles in extremely nasty snow/wind/icing conditions across the northwestern US. Handles snow packed "driveways" with 12-15% grades. We have room for my yellow lab in his kennel, 3 suitcases and a box of apples behind the split rear seat. Road noise is less than our Subaru OB. We have averaged 25+ MPG since purchase with individual tanks running between 24 MPG and 29 mpg highway. V6 cruises easily at 70 MPH with power to spare while passing. Driver visibility is great. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Pleased with the fuel economy. The arrangement of space in rear seats and behind the rear seats is great. 5- speed AT allows you to select the appropriate gear when climbing or descending steep grades. I like the space saved with the externally mounted spare tire.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car new from the dealership last year (jan. 07), and I was looking for a slight upgrade from a small sedan, and for a car with better reliability in the snow, considering I live in the Northeast. Last year didn't really snow but this year we've gotten a few big storms one with snow falling 3-4" per hour and I had absolutely no problems! the anti skid is fantastic and the 4WD kicks on automatically so I didn't have to do anything but drive! I've driven the car down to Florida and to DC and had no problems got good gas mileage (26 MPG), I love the car and would recommend it to anyone looking for a small SUV. Its very spacious and comfortable... and it drives just like a car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased an '07 RAV4, February, 2008, used, from a Toyota dealer, replacing a '01 Ford Taurus. Bought a 4 cyl, fwd. Use for daily commuter and weekend chores. Occasional trips. Just recently, averaged 27.5 mph at a steady 75 mph on a 500 mile round-trip. Around town, am getting 22 to 24 mph. As a daily driver, the car is excellent. Perfect for weekend chores. The swing rear door does cause some problems while carrying lumber, however, I knew that when I purchased the vehicle. Otherwise, car is perfect for intended use. Am very pleased with performance, handling, and overall build. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior room; peppy engine; sliding rear seats allowing for massive amount of legroom for rear passengers; fun to drive for a 4 cyl suv.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This seems to be a good car. My wife has a 2008 CRV and I naturally compare the 2. CRV has a nicer interior, but not as comfortable. The CRV is a higher trim level. CRV has better pick up and, so far, better fuel mileage. RAV4 is easy to get in an out of, has a lower lift to load back, easier folding seats, looks more manly and has better visibility. The cruise stalk is terrible, in the way. 2001 Escort was on the wheel, why can't a 2008 RAV4?. Doors should look when you put in gear. This is more of a runaround then a fall in love vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AC controls are large. Low lift in to back area. Easy to get into. Good pickup. Great visibility.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great car with the exception of the stock tires. If you get this vehicle, get new tires (I have Assurance Comfort Treads by Goodyear). We just had 16 inches of snow and not only did the Rav handle it like a champ it exceeded all expectations. The 4WD did exactly what it was supposed to do. The drive is steady and the V6 is very powerful. Just step on the gas and you will feel the 269 horses propel you out of the thick of traffic. It is a reliable car of good quality that doesn't feel heavy or cumbersome to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4wd, V6 engine, 269 horses, multi disk player is nice too. Love having a full size spare. I travel a lot on highway and don't worry about a flat especially in bad weather. I know the spare will handle the elements.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought my Rav-4 and am already not happy. I have been getting some back pains since buying the car. Test drove a couple of small SUVs because wanted to downsize and at the dealership this was great, but have started to have problems with the back hurting, no place to put change with out it ringing all the time, push button dash area stinks because everything I put in it slides and bangs, car bounces more than I like on highway, and cargo area light is a joke. My SUV also does not ding when the lights are left on, I plan to check when I go in for my first service.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's our first Toyota (past is mostly Hondas & Fords), and has been a good purchase so far. It replaced our Ford Explorer, and the ride and handling are great. 3rd row seat is good, but tight for the kids on short rides. Good ride / handling, and the 4 cyl engine has good acceleration (better than the CRV and V6 Escape we tested). Easy to get in and out for my wife (only 5' tall), and has good seating position. She drives it mostly around town, so we are only averaging 21 mpg, but hope to get better results on highway trips. Interior is well constructed, controls are easy to use with good layout. Looking forward to mileage on longer trips, and to see how good AWD drive is in the snow</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the RAV4 right before Labor Day weekend. It's one of the best cars I've owned, so far. The V6 is extremely powerful. When you really punch it, it can feel almost dangerous due to the torque, so be careful! :) Gas mileage is averaging about 22 mpg. Overall, this is an awesome vehicle for our family of 5. No regrets, I would definitely buy one again!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first Toyota I have ever owned and will probably be the last. I have only had it for 2 months and I have lots of complaints. There are a lot of rattles coming from the dash and when I took it in of course they said they were not out of the ordinary. But, a bigger more serious problem is that the car has shut down on me twice while waiting at a red light. I have had to take the car in 4 times and they have put it on the computer and have not been able to duplicate the problem. They told me it's the traction sensor and that I am putting extreme pressure on the brakes which is causing the computer to think I am stopping suddenly and shutting down the engine. Is that nuts? </TEXT>

<TEXT>It was 10 years since I bought a new car and I chose the Rav4 over the CRV after careful consideration and driving the V6 version. I needed a new car for a newly emerging family so I needed something more useful than a 2 seater truck and Miata. I required fuel efficiency and a healthy reliability rating so Toyota and Honda were top of the list. I chose to get an SUV over a car because of the utility factor (I also have 2 big dogs). I can't comment on reliability yet but I am in love with this vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is by far better than the Honda crv I had before. Gas mileage even with a 6 cyl is by far better than the Honda. Interior in the Honda was a little better. The main point against the Honda for me it has not the same power and the gas mileage is not as good. The seating and all the little bells and whistles are great. Handling and driving comfort are exceptional. Off road driving, attributed to great ground clearance and power, is great !</TEXT>

<TEXT>Previously purchased an '07 Subaru Outback and disappointed with the interior space, although a great driving machine. Have had the Rav4 for 3 weeks and my wife and I absolutely love this car. Excellent driving position and front seat comfort and visibility while the 4 cylinder engine provides more than adequate power. If we lived up north I would recommend the all wheel drive, but in Maryland and/or further south the FWD is excellent since EST and traction control are standard. The 6 cylinder only truly necessary if one lives in a hilly area. Averaging 25 MPG. Our favorite car in 40 years of driving.</TEXT>

I tried spacers under seat legs, extra spring on gas pedal, lumbar pillow, seat cushion, none worked. I have to drive for now but this is the last toyota for me. That is saying a lot from a guy that had 4 so far but this one is not my favorite. Really don't like silly side-swinging rear door. Dash rattles. It struggles to get the rated MPGs.

Dash lighting and visibility - poorly lit & can't see some displays when wearing polarized sunglasses. Center and door arm rests too low. Throttle: peppy after lag, way too touchy, use more of the travel. 4x4 lock: this is an SUV, I want to control when it is 4x4 not have it automatically switch out at 25 mph.

<TEXT>My first complaint is the interior. Really cheap looking. Other comparable models like the CR-V have much nicer interior. Toyota really lacks technology in their interiors. Cargo area lighting is so terrible! Why put the light on the door which is going to be open? Furthermore, door opens to curbside! Why? I'm only 5'7 and I sit with the seat all the way back, and that is already tight for me. if you're tall, definitely don't get a Toyota. They for some reason only have enough room for people my height. Radio antenna is cheap also. Unscrews easily which causes radio static. MPG not as good as advertised.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought one of the few 2008 V6 AWD base model left after comparing Honda CRV, Subaru Forester, and 08 Highlander. Perfect size for my family of 4 with 2 teenagers. Like the efficiency of the electric-on-demand AWD with reasonably good mpg and absolutely fun to drive. However, don't expect the quietness/refinement of a Camry. Road vibration/noise sometimes noticeable at any speed. If you want to take advantage of the last few 08 RAV4 left like I did, make sure you check out the 09 model before making the decision as Toyota made some good improvements which may be important to you. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2008 rav4 4x4 base model in February 2008. It was the best vehicle I ever owned until it hit 850 miles and that's when I could hear a loud constant rattling coming from the dashboard, more specifically the center console. The vehicle was brought back to the dealership 4 times and was never permanently fixed. The master technician, who was great to deal with even replaced my vents in the center dash with a new RAV4 on the sales lot. At times it sounded like a popcorn machine! Finally, a field technical expert from Toy inspected the vehicle and determined that it was A NORMAL OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC! Very disappointed, 1st and last Toyota I'll ever own.</TEXT>

Looked into the Escape as well and for a couple thousand more, you get better quality, mileage, and of course, legend reliability. Plenty of room for everyone, got it with the third row for convenience. Tight, but still fine. If you are looking at any comps, just go to the Toyota dealer and buy this car.

<TEXT>Had the car for four months now. Took it on a cross country trip from MA to CA and the car did not disappoint as it was comfortable even during 13 hours/day drives and the engine allowed effortless driving and passing. Was able to load a lot of contents in the car yet allowed one person to sleep flat in the back. All the safety features incorporated in the car (e.g. VSC, EBD, etc) saved us from a highway catastrophe by a reckless driver in Chicago's south side and allowed us to maintain control. However, tighter brakes and suspension would create more driving confidence. Radio/6-disc CD changer/MP3 player/auxiliary port allows endless forms of audio entertainment!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I searched a lot of models before buying the RAV4 six months ago. The RAV4 was the only one I found that: 1) a 6'3" guy like me could fit into comfortably - I am long torso and headroom is always a challenge, but the height-adjustable seat and telescoping steering wheel did the trick. 2) Properly equipped can tow a modest camper or boat. 3) Would still get into the upper 20s for highway gas mileage. The V6 RAV4 has done all that and more for me. I am getting 22-24 mpg around town and 26-28 highway so far.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior room is much bigger than the exterior suggests. The V6 power is fun and helpful when passing on 2-lane highways, with little or no gas mileage penalty compared to 4-cyl. models.

<TEXT>A very good value for your money. This SUV has a ton of power (269 horsepower), and handles exceptionally. The fun factor CANNOT be matched by any vehicle in its class, and probably not by many out of its class. The mileage is very good too, as mine gets 24mpg over all. The interior is comfortable for five people (I am 6ft 3in) and the third row people can sit reasonably comfortable, depending on how you adjust the second row of seats... but is fantastic if you have a few kids. The quality is very solid, the doors seem heavy when you shut them, and the items that are plastic do not have that 'cheap' feel to them. The controls are well placed and very helpful. I am very satisfied overall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just a quick update to my earlier review. One month and 800 miles later, and it just gets better and better. I'm now nudging 26 mpg combined (35% hwy, 65% city). Sticker said 20 city, 25 highway... don't you believe it. Drive sensibly and you'll blow the doors off the posted mileage ratings. I'm planning a trip in the next month, and fully expect to get better than 30 mpg. Not bad, for a 4 cyl. AWD SUV. The roads here are still being repaired from the bad winter...pot holes everywhere.

Many parts of the interior just feel like they don't fit together or are loose. Feel stuck with the RAV4 rather than loving it. Though it is small, tall drivers will fit comfortably. Lots of storage spaces in both front and rear.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks great, rides great on highway, lots of power on V6; great hidden storage in rear cargo compartment; almost no blind spot; ability to move second row seats forward/backward/recline</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my car since May 16th, 2008 and just love it. Its Everglade Metallic, beautiful green color, it does look silver sometimes. I love the moonroof, didn't think I would, nice to watch the rain. Back seats have lots of leg room. We seem to get good gas mileage, haven't been on a long trip yet though. I love the inside door handles, very neat looking and the bluetooth is great. I also had to get dealer to help me with that. I had a 2000 Rav 4 and this is much larger and still easy to drive and park. I did have a Nissan Murano that was totalled in October. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We wanted a vehicle that had lots of storage space. We went with the V6 for the tow package, if and when we may need it. Taking our daughters to and from college was a little tight in my 99 Camry. So I'm happy to say that I just love my RAV, I got a car that looks great, handles great, and is truly fun to drive. Plus serves the purpose of the purchase. Just got back from picking up daughter at college 2200 miles round trip and average 25 mpg, that's loaded right up for the trip home. I would make this purchase again in a heart beat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I ventured from Toyota in 2006 to a Kia Sportage EX V6 AWD w/leather. Nice, but just not the overall quality/style of Toyota, not good mpg, strange shifting pattern in AT. I asked myself what I'd want to see in the driveway 5 years down the road. So, I got my RAV4. When I get behind the wheel, I'm at peace. It's more solid, handles better, and I'm getting about 24-25 mpg combined so far. The quality and value will always be there, and the RAV4 will far outlast any 10 yr. 100k warranty others offer, and without problems. I opted for the 4 cyl., but see the V6 is rated higher MPG??? I'll believe it when I see it. The 4 cyl. has ample power without gulping down your paycheck in gas.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear door entry, solid-well built, good mpg for an AWD SUV, nice styling, fold- flat rear seats, rear sub-floor storage compartment, lighted vanity mirrors, dual dash storage on passenger side, rides solid, great drive handling feel, good seats, 17" wheels, 4 wheel disc brakes, quiet for base model.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased this 08 base RAV at the end of October. It's now 7 months old and this is an update to an earlier post. The front upholstery continues to pill and fuzz and just look really, really bad. The back seats are fine since they are hardly used. I have an 8 year old car that looks better inside than this one. It took a certified letter to Toyota for Toyota to tell my dealer they would help them solve the problem. They've offered custom seat covers, but that was over a month ago and I'm still waiting to see if they match the rest of the interior. Wish I didn't like the handling and pep so much - it would be much easier to just get rid of the RAV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The height and size of the doors enables easy entry and exit. Forward visibility from the drivers seat is excellent. A short turning radius is helpful when parking. The power seat and tilt & telescoping wheel help to gain a comfortable seating position. The ride is stiffer than a car?s ride. It seems like a 5-speed transmission would be helpful also for the 4-cylinder engine. The RAV4 is quick and does not have the usual 4-cyl engine noise at highway speeds. There is a transmission clunk on the first engagement of ?Drive? each morning.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Toyota hit the nail directly on the head with the new RAV4 providing what American drivers need and want. In-city mileage is 20 mpg+. Had a little rattle for a few miles but service department solved it.

<TEXT>I've had my 2008 Limited Rav 4 for 1 month and I just love it! I went from a 4 Runner to a Rav 4 because I decided that I didn't need as much room for my future purchase of a car. I also wanted a vehicle that had better gas mileage. So far, I get about 22-24 miles/gallon. That's great compared to my 15-17 in my 4-Runner. I love the way the Rav 4 drives (it's smooth and very fast) and I like the amenities (heated seats, bluetooth, tire indicator, temperature view, auto seat up and down control, etc). Moreover, I like the design of the dashboard. It's innovative. I encourage you to buy the Rav 4 Limited. You won't regret it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife, 2 dogs (German Shepherd and Rottweiler), and I needed a car that could carry us all on trips in comfort and with good gas mileage. The RAV4 seemed to fit the bill. In actuality, it more than fits our needs. We do not need super power on the highway, but the RAV4 is quick and does not have the usual 4- cyl engine noise at highway speeds. MPG is a solid 27 average for us. Fit and finish are great. This base FWD model is perfect for our situation. We could not be happier with this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 1999 Sienna since the kids are older and don't need the van with mediocre mileage and performance. I test drove the RAV4 with a 4 cylinder and was unimpressed, very noisy during acceleration and not much power. Then I tried the 6 cylinder and it is awesomely powerful off the line. I have put on 2,000 miles in about 6 weeks and I have gotten 23-24 mpg. I'm sure I would do better if I could keep it under 75. So far, the RAV4 has been fun to drive and performs more like a car then other SUVs I have driven. Took the kids skiing in the Catskills and it took the mountains effortlessly. Can't wait to try the 4X4 in the snow.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Over the past 9 years I have purchased 4 Toyota products and this one is by far the best. My last purchase was a 2004 Highlander which my wife and I really enjoyed. You can't beat the overall performance of the engine and transmission. It actually feels like the vehicle is not running and at the same time just wants to take off. Outstanding performance. Ample room and at the same time, I can't see a whole lot of difference between this and the Highlander I owned. Our first choice was the Limited addition but chose the sport because of the darker seats and dash.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got married and wanted something slightly bigger than a sedan (previous car was a 1994 Accord coupe). We test drove the Rogue, CR-V, Tucson, Vibe, and RAV4. We wanted something that was versatile, reliable, and gets good mileage. The 4-cyl gives good acceleration, but can be noisy. Leg room is good enough (I'm 6'1"). We live in a snowy climate but don't need the AWD. Very happy so far, would buy again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the way this vehicle handles. It is quite nimble and quick. In the V6 model acceleration is better (much better) than I had with a V8 Explorer. Interior room is very satisfactory allowing me to have my large breed dog crate in the back without issue and to also offer room to the other dogs. It is fun to drive!! We did some off road driving yesterday through mud, up hills and over some rough terrain. I have the V6 Ltd model and am very pleased so far. I am small so the seats work well for me as does the rest of the car. The best thing about this SUV is the handling. It is so fast out of the starting blocks it was tough to get used to. Turning radius is on a dime. Stopping on a dime OK.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, quickness and nimble. Interior space. I have large breed dogs and it's tough to fit them all into a vehicle. I can fit my Pyr and Lab in there, without a problem.

<TEXT>Purchased my base model 2008 RAV4 at the end of October. Love everything about it except the upholstery. At 3 months old and under 5500 miles, the fabric on the seats and on the door panels is starting to pill and fuzz. Toyota tells me this is "normal wear and tear". Thankfully my dealer disagrees. They are trying to find me matching fabric. Glad I no longer have kids and their gear to haul around. The interior would not survive.

<TEXT>We traded in our sports car for the new RAV4. Our hope was to achieve the gas mileage abilities of our Nissan Maxima (family car) while gaining a more versatile vehicle. We did have one noise issue that was hard to track down since it would only happen at freeway speeds. The source of the noise was the roof rack cross member (it was loose). This caused a noise as it shifted position due to wind speed pushing it backward. The 2nd noise source was a loose radio antenna. We are averaging between 22.5-24 MPG in mixed driving (65%+ city) with the V6. Our RAV has just over 1000 miles on it and I suspect the MPG will be increasing. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car about a month and put on over 1,000 miles. I sold my Saab 9-5 wagon when it would not go up the driveway of our new home. The RAV has NO problem going up a very steep incline in ice and snow. It does make the "beep" sound to let me know that it is adjusting for slippage. I test drove it hard to make sure it could handle Catskill Mountain weather and it has proven to be just what it promised. Mine has "down hill assist" which I like because sometimes I have to go to work before the local plow person comes to our driveway and it really does help. Also there is LOTS of storage space. I picked up two big chairs for a friend and they went right in.</TEXT>

Fast, responsive, comfortable, quiet, good visibility, spacious, tight handling, great looking, nice riding, solid car. Cruising at 70 mph, and tach only reads about 2000 rpm. My old car, a v6 also, used to read 3000 rpm. I live in the U.K. where sometimes it's better/safer to drive on the freeways fast (80mph+). I used to be a little concerned about motor wear in my old car. I don't think I'll have to be concerned about it anymore. I don't think that the 5 speed auto trans has any big issues.

<TEXT>I purchased the '08 RAV4 Sport V6 AWD right before the snow season. I drive on snow/ice covered roads regularly. The car handles well and rarely slips as I go up and down steep hills and around tight curves usually in 2-6 inches of snow at roughly 35 mph. I have not needed to use the lock-in feature for 4WD but it's nice to know it's available if snow gets too deep. On dry pavement, the RAV4 feels like a car. It's not bouncy like a truck frame 4WD and gets far better gas mileage. Plus, it really holds true speed with speed control engaged. No drift acceleration or deceleration through mountainous terrain. Fun to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my 2008 V6 4WD Rav4 for a week and lovin' every minute of drivining it. I've already tested the PSI warning light as I had a nail in the tire within a few days of purchasing. Had the light not gone on, I suspect I would have had a flat tire vs. being able to check it out before it went completely flat. Engine very quiet - to the point it sounds like it stalled. It's the perfect size - takes up the same space in the garage as my Volvo S70 - maybe even a little less space. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned the 6-cylinder Ltd version since November 07. It's a lot of fun to drive. The power of the V6 is amazing, and likewise the stopping ability is great, too. It corners very well, with a surprisingly tight turning radius, making it very easy to park. It has excellent visibility, which makes it easy to back out of a parking space. The dual climate controls work much better that the dual climate controls in my American-brand sedan. The side-opening rear door makes it easy for my 5-foot tall wife to load groceries and close the door afterwards. The 8-way adjustable seat gives her a good view of the road. She loves the car.</TEXT>

Better gas mileage from the 3.5 v6, great handling, fully loaded, quieter but still road noise, front wheels getting brake dust,smoother ride, tighter turning radius. 2 trip meters, outside temp., Escape did not have, but needs mileage computer. Seats a little tight up front, too much room in rear. Must be for Japanese market, smaller people. Could easily move seat rails back 2 in. Center console box could have been bigger, higher.
