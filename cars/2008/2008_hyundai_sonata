<TEXT>My 08 has several issues, and all seem common with my fellow owner. Loose molding strips, a failed oxygen sensor, failed tire pressure lights. The warranty is attractive, but read the small print, I was disappointed with a transmission issue. This car looks nice but is sluggish around 30- 40mph. It really should not be compared to a Accord or Camry,, unless of course you can measure intangible issues with the cost savings. It does not have the re-sale value associated with Japanese vehicles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very solid car, and all problems since I've owned it have been taken care of free of charge. They were only minor. Sagging mirror, but likely due to a cd case hanging on it. Dead battery. Seat issue. I even got a free rental for two of the fixes. I have been really happy so far with the car. Very spacey and quiet. And even though it is cheaper than most other cars, looks more expensive in some areas compared to others I have looked at. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Bad Car</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have a 2008 Sonata, the brakes are gone after less than 18K miles of very light driving; the dealer said that they are not part of the so much advertised hyundai warranty; too bad they said. Hey, brakes that do not even last 18K, is this hyundai's quality? It seems so; I wonder what else will be braking soon. I will never, ever buy a hyundai again, and I advise against buying one. Yes, they are a little cheaper than the Japanese cars, but so much worse! My wife has a Japanese car for over 6 years, over 60K, not a single problem with it! Keep away from hyundai. And, yes, their service, at least here in Henrietta, NY is terrible.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car seemed OK and when I drove it for a while I got home and looked under the hood. Most of the fluids where not at the proper level. I topped them myself rather than drive 40 miles back. The engine luggs at 40 MPH when in top gear. Suspension handles bumps in a way that feels odd like the tires are bouncing over the bumps. The dealer claims an oil change is needed every 3000 miles and the company backs this up but when I first got the car they said 3000 only for severe use. Now they say everything in the US is severe. I had 2 mechanical problems with a tire pressure detector malfunction and a brake problem. Their "best warranty" did not cover anything. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car looks nice and gets reasonable mileage. The trunk is big.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After researching and test driving Honda Accords, Toyota Camrys, and finally the Sonata Limited, it was clear that for the money, I was able to get luxury with the Sonata that I wouldn't get with other 2. We have always driven Hondas (7 to date) and my husband was skeptical about going with a Sonata. However, I made the decision to get the Sonata and once the dealer agreed to my terms.....no $$ down, zero percent interest, and payments under $300 for the Limited, its was a done deal. I love driving the car and it's super comfortable on road trips. The only negative to say is that the side door molding loosened and had to be replaced and the driver's side visor has had to be replaced. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Short and simple... This car is outstanding. I may not have scored it very high in comparison to other reviews, but I'm rating it on a scale in comparison to other cars I've owned. I have highly recommended this car to others! I purchased it new for 6k less than a 4 cylinder accord ex-l. It is quieter than our acura tl and rides much more comfortable - especially on long trips. No rattles or issues whatsoever. The 4 cylinder is fairly slow but I bought it for the gas mileage. I can get right at 30 mpg if I keep it under 70 mph. I drive mostly interstate commute. (I check it at the pump and not just by the computer.)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride and comfort. Quiet!!! Gas mileage. Stereo is really good for this price range. Don't expect the handling of the Accord but in reality all I want is a good quite and comfortable ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Sonata after renting a few on business trips and was very impressed with the car. The 6 has all kinds of get up and go and smooth... This car is very quiet at 70 mph and fairly nimble when doing evasive maneuvers. A lot of bang for the buck and even better reliability. Mine nw has 32000 miles at 15 months of age and has never been in the shop for repairs. I think it blows away the competition as far as price performance and comfort. Yeah, I'd buy another one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I replaced a 2003 Toyota Avalon XLS with the 2008 Sonata Limited V6 and LOVE IT! I've had it about 16 months now and am 100% satisfied. I, like others, was a little cautious of buying a Hyundai but have zero regrets. I really wanted a Prius when I started looking but the price was in the stratosphere and figured it would take 5+ years to make up the difference in gas. I looked at the Avalon's and Camry's but just couldn't justify the HUGE price difference. The interior design and quality is not on par with the Avalon, but is nearly as good as the Camry. It was all the bundled features: V6, traction and stability control, safety features, Infinity audio, and creature comforts that sold me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car for about ten months now, and it has been excellent, good mileage, no mechanical issues, it's my first Hyundai, so I wasn't exactly sure of what to expect, very satisfied. I live in Canada, and unfortunately, the 4 cylinder cars don't have traction control or stability control? not sure about this, standard on all cars in the states, come on Hyundai, we're the ones who really need these features! So, I'd be sure to get those features in my next one/or if I could start over, as winter traction could certainly have been better. Otherwise he car has been great, drive lots, runs great, could have an oil life monitor, more headroom, and a power passenger seat, next car will.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Hyundai Sonata Limited for a little more than a month now, and I am loving it. I have never owned a Hyundai, and have always driven Nissans. Traded an 04 Maxima SE for the Sonata because of the remarkable warranty. You can't beat it. The Sonata is fun to drive, and I found it to be much quieter than the Nissan. Power is more than sufficient, and the CVVT shifts flawlesly. Interior room is spacious, but I think the fore/aft position on the seat tract should be a bit longer. I love the Infinity sound system, however I had to take it back to the dealer 2X to fix an annoying rattle in the rear deck coming from the 3rd brake light. I also think the suspension should be firmer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the 4th Hyundai I have owned (we bought the Entourage last year which is great). I have to say after owning Fords and Hondas, this Hyundai Sonata has exceeded my expectations over the other manufacturers. You just can't consider Hyundai as a stereotypical 'cheap' quality vehicle. The ride is smooth and the V6 engine provides ample power (234 HP). The interior design shows quality and there are safety features galore. In addition, the gas mileage is reasonable. From past experience, I have had virtually no problems with defects, etc. compared to other makes I have owned. The Hyundai warranty is the proof in the pudding. I will not buy from another car manufacturer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After extensive research,I decided to buy a 2008 Sonata. When comparing it to the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, I decided that the Sonata offered more bang for the buck. While not as stylish as the Accord and Camry, it doesn't have the aura that car thiefs relish. I selected the Limited with the 3.3L V6. The acceleration is good and the CVT is flawless. Ride is firm when necessary and feels cushy on the highway. Road noise is average, but cabin comfort is fantastic. The fit and finish are superb and the Infinity sound system with the rear window mounted subwooofer is impressive. Its my first Hyundai and I have to say that the history of driver and magazine reviews were accurate. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Hyundai since I have always been skeptical about buying the Hyundai brand. After extensive research, I settled with the Sonata GLS. I haven't had too many miles yet since I have only gotten it. The car feels comfortable and everything feels just fine. It's comparable to other Accord, Civic, Maxima that I have/had owned or better. A few things are missing (AUX inlet, steeling wheel mounted radio control etc) but they are not the show stoppers. The good things are it comes with the exceptional warranty (others are copying it too), ESC, all kinds of airbags. Another good selling point is, you can knock off quite a bit from the price. This is impossible for other comparable cars</TEXT>

<TEXT>Sharp looking car. The interior is incredibly comfortable and supportive. The seats adjust to fit you perfectly. As I am a taller driver, leg room and head room are important. My two boys are also quite tall and they have PLENTY of leg room in the back. I went from an 8 year old smaller SUV to this car and so far, have been very, very impressed. It's quiet, smooth and a pleasure to drive. The trunk gives me as much room as my SUV did. I can hit Sam's Club and the grocery store, plus have room leftover. Try it when you are shopping. Research is great, but you have to drive your top picks to make a good decision. I think you will be pleasantly surprised! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Got my '08 GL (Canadian model) manual transmission in late June. Car has been great so far except for a rear parcel shelf rattle that I can't get rid of. It is comfortable, smooth riding, roomy and peppy with the manual. The engine is very easy to stall with the manual though. Mileage is also good. Wind noise is fairly noticeable even at normal speeds. Big car feel for a very good price. Overall, I bought a drab but well equipped and competent intermediate for the price of a compact with a good waranty to boot in case of issues.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Sonata was not on my original list of cars - I was looking at a Civic hybrid or Accord. But, the fuel mileage, styling and warranty made me take a closer look. The final factor was a $3,000 rebate. I saved several thousand dollars over what I thought I'd have to spend to get a high quality, stylish sedan. Having owned it for a full year now, I can honestly say I am 100% satisfied with the car - mileage in the 27-28 range, zero service or mechanical issuesi. I/m really glad I chose the Hyundai. Can't wait to trade it up for a new Genisis in a couple of years!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car with 30k miles on it and have driven it about 2k miles. I love this car. Getting onto the highway is stress-free because this car can "get-up-and-go" when you put your foot into it. Its got some "nut" which I like in a car. Its quiet and smooth. I like the sunroof and the ample room of the interior. Its comfortable and an ease to drive. Gas mileage is about 31 highway (or more) and 19 town. I can't speak for long term reliability but it purrs like a kitten and is nearly soundless at idle, no engine noises or "clickings". Performance for a mid- sized 4 door family car like this is not common.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice power and good lines interior and exterior. This isn't a "chick-magnet" so don't judge it against them. Its a reasonable responsible nice car that can get you from here to there with ample power. Nice safety features. I feel safer in this car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is built very cheaply. The interior plastic surfaces squeak, and the front suspension has a really annoying squeak/rattle. The interior lights don't come on when you remove the ignition key. The switches on the door (lock/unlock, windows, etc.) are not illuminated. The ignition key ring taps against the dash board when driving. The Infinity sound system's subwoofer is mounted in the cardboard deck behind the rear seats and creates an annoying distortion even at low volume.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a "previously loved" '08 with 20000 miles on it. My wife and I are very happy with the vehicle. Great value for the money. I can't imagine spending thousands more on a Camry or Accord. How much better can they be? Ride is smooth and quiet, performance is more than adequate. Steering could be more precise, but is OK for a family car. Nice large trunk. Front seats could be a little longer for more thigh support, but are still comfortable. Interior quality is good, but the design is a bit lacking. This has been fixed in the '09's. Vehicle should come standard with ABS, but it is only on higher trim levels in Canada. OEM Tires are not great - noisy and wear quickly - will be replaced.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the car for about a month and put on approx. 1000 mi. Have gotten very good interstate mpg- about 28 @ 80 mph, about 31 mpg @ 70 mph. Rides quiet and nice, plenty of power for normal driving. Very roomy as well- we were considering a Fusion or Milan based on reputation, price, and mpg, but the Sonata met or exceeded those requirements with more room for (future) strollers, etc. I also own a 01 Sonata, and would without a doubt recommend Hyundai vehicles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall I'm very impressed. Commuter car bought for just under $18K in Franklin, TN. 4 cylinder is okay but could use more power for this size of car. Only problem is with the Hankook tires. Car rides great and is ultra quite - quieter than our Acura TL. I've driven two 09 models as loaners and they are very loud. Hyundai must have taken out some of the insulation. I'm not too impressed with the mpg. If I really baby the car on the interstate I can get 28 mpg at 70 mph w/out AC. (I check mpg at the pump - computer is not accurate.) I average 25-26 per tank mostly highway but really have to stay under 70. Car driven 6K so far. I do recommend this car based on comfort, quite ride and price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quite ride!!! Good size vehicle. Feels roomy. Good size trunk. Price! Got this car for $6K less than 4 cyl Honda EX-L. I think Hyundai is a good buy! You don't have to pay the premium price Honda dealers want.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car right after Christmas. I looked at the sonata in and out. This is one of the best cars I have ever owned. The power of the v-6 is awesome! Inside is so quiet you can't even hear the engine running. The infinety sound system is the best sounding stereo I've ever had in a car. Also the heated leather seats came in Handy this winter. I have gotten many compliments on the style of the car. Some people think it's a Lexus or Mercedes. The gas mileage is not bad either. I get about 26 mpg combo city and interstate driving. I highly recommend anyone to test drive the sonata. I think they'll be sold like I was.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wrote my original review 2/09/08. 34yr old buyer. After 5 mos. of ownership I'm still very happy w/ my purchase. I have the dark cherry red with color matched door handles, blk leather interior. Sharp looks,rides beautifully. It is roomy; 4 adults and a car seat with room to spare. Huge trunk. Great mileage. Good power. My only 'regret' is not getting the V6 (NOTE:the 4 cyl is NO SLOUCH!) I got my loaded 2008 Ltd off the showroom floor for $18.5K plus tax/title. I do like the new 2009 interior more + the improved HP and 1 mpg better for the 2009. Were I not so picky, there would be scarcely a chance to criticize or compare my 2008. No buyer's remorse on day 1.Still happy after 5 months.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the spaciousness. I prefer the front grille on my 2008 to the 2009. The BIG trunk is awesome. Fit and finish are great. I didn't read the manual; I found a new gadget on each drive.It's loaded w/ features I didn't expect. 5 disk CD changer was a surprise.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We love our Hyundai. It is not quite as frugal on gas as my Chevy cavalier was but much more comfortable to drive and a lot more power and luxery inside. Rented one to drive from Dallas, tx to ca on vacation and was so impressed with it we went out and bought one the same month we got back. For the money it is a great buy. We love the built in XM radio and 6 disc cd player. So far no complaints with it. But have several with dealer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first time to own a Hyundai. I was enticed by the hefty rebate Hyundai was offering until June 2 (3K off). I have always been a Honda owner, except for the one impulse buy of a Jeep Grand Cherokee- which was a bad mistake. I have been very happy with my Sonata thus far. I often get it confused with the Accord if they are parked closely. I have a very basic model and am loving it. I like to take corners fast and it is possible in this car! I would like to have more features, but after owning a totally "loaded" car and everything being controlled by a computer chip that went bad, have a simple, no frills car is just enough for me. And, who can turn down the incredible warranty?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am thrilled with my new sonata. The 6 is a great engine, the car drives very Nice on the highway and is very powerful. I love the radio controls on the steering wheel and I love the free (for 3 months) satellite radio. I think this is one of the nicest looking sedans on the road today. I have the silver with Gray leather interior and it looks terrific. I am a Canadian and purchased the car from towne Hyundai in Buffalo NY and they were great to deal with. The prices I showed them from Edmunds really helped me get a good deal. No problems importing the car into Canada either. I saved well over $10,000 on this vehicle compared to Canadian prices. (thanks to the par value of our currency!).</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the 3rd new sonata I have owned. It drives very well, but has 2 small problems the dealer and factory haven't helped. There is a vibration between 38-44 mph in town and the trunk comes unlocked about once a week on its own. All the Sonatas I have owned are generally great. This one gets 32 mpg at 75mph highway and 28 mpg in town. The 2007 got 25 in town and 35 highway. Everybody else is right, the cup holders stink! I recommend these cars to everyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned this car for about a year now. Owned a Tucson prior and it was in the shop right away. I was given a Sonata as a loaner and loved it, so I ended up trading in the Tucson for a 2008 Sonata. I read these reviews and wanted to comment. This is a great car for the price, it absolutely is great in the snow, can not say the same for the Tucson. However, I do have to agree with another post. When you have the heat on the floor, it comes out through the upper vents, but I have found if you close them, it forces it more to the floor. Also, it has alot of rattles in it, but so does my husbands year old Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I took delivery of my Sonata SE this afternoon and I am really impressed so far. For years I've wanted a 4 cylinder with a 5 spd that was fun & value packed for a reasonable price, a la Hondas of years past. I had heard about the big rebates and called a dealer for a quote. They had the car I wanted in NC. The dealership sent drivers to get it and bring it back to Atlanta. Then they installed black leather and delivered it to my office for free. The paper work was as agreed, so no drama there. They threw in tires for life (sweet!) and I got it for less than 18 grand out the door which is just unreal. This car has so much value packed in it. Super nice & safe. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The first six weeks of owning my Sonata it was back to the dealership every week trying to fix all the rattles. Broken part replaced for the glove box, broken part replaced in the dash and another noise resolved in the steering column. Today had a door panel replace due to poor plastic welds in the original panel. This isn't the end to the noise. Still has a rattle in the instrument panel. Seatbelt chime is annoying. It dings even if your in park. Heat always comes out from defroster even when set on floor only. Legs never get warm. Defroster defrosts windshield unevenly.

<TEXT>We purchased an ?08 Sonata GLS w/ popular equipment pkg about 1 month ago. This is an extremely quiet, comfortable car. The amount of equipment you get for the money is amazing, and the mileage is exceptional also. With the first 2 fill ups we are averaging between 28.5 and 29.5 mpg with our 4 cylinder with automatic tranny in mixed driving. I am anxious to see what the mileage will be on a longer trip. Every time I drive it, I marvel at how solid the car is. After this winter, our roads are in the worst condition they have been in the last 30 years and I have yet to hear any kind of a rattle or squeak. Nothing looks, sounds or feels cheap on this car. We are very happy with our Sonata.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As I pulled the car out for the test drive, I told the dealer that if I hear loud wind noises, we can forget about Hyundai altogether. I drove about 8 miles in city and 8 miles on freeway, where I briefly reached 80 mph effortlessly. The handling was responsive, the ride very smooth and quiet (later, I found out that Hyundai engineers redesigned the door hinges and side mirrors to reduce wind noise). The average mileage for my test drive was 26mpg. I really would love it to be close to 29-30 mpg, but I can live with it since I drive only 20 miles to and from work each day and once month a trip of about 220 miles. The 17.7 gallon fuel tank should get me a long way. Love everything!</TEXT>

But after owning it from last 3 months, i feel it was a bad, Bad, BAD decision and i should have gone for Camry. The Vehicle has very high inside noise (No aerodynamics at all), Cold start is really really BAD and noisy. At just 5000 miles, it has started to have some vibration noise, Passenger side air bag OFF sign remains off even when person of 100+ LB sits on it, suspension is not very helpful in rough roads, sometime you literally feel like pushing engine to the full capacity, Driving is no fun, AM radio is not very clear.

<TEXT>Have learned to trust automobile ratings by Consumer Reports, especially when confirmed by owner's evaluations at Edmunds. The Sonata has earned those high ratings. Solid performance, with surprising good acceleration, both around town and on the highway, for a four cylinder engine. Anti-lock breaks are firm and secure. Turning and cornering are comfortable. Seating has prominent lower back support. Two minor quibbles, each with solution. Passenger seat belt in retracted position bangs around against center post when windows rolled down. Lever on passenger seat can be used to clip seat belt away from post. Second, side of car easily gets muddy on wet streets, solved by mud flaps. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been looking at the Sonatas for months now and finally jumped in when I saw the $3000 rebate. Since the first time I saw it I thought it reminded me of a BMW or high-end Honda. Beautiful lines and Xenon headlamps make it a very sexy car. Even the XM/FM radio antenna complete this picture. The front fog lamps are also cool looking. The 4Cyl is by far the most powerful and quietest 4Cyl I've ever driven. It easily compares with my stock 6Cyl Nissan Maxima engine for acceleration. It was an easy choice after test driving the 4 and 6. Yes, the 6Cyl is VERY powerful and fast, but the extra $2000 price tag plus the annual increase in fuel cost of $400 is simply not worth it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I do a lot of driving and I needed a decent commuter car. I bought this car primary to the fact that it had a $5000 Rebate on it. I looked at the Honda Accord and thought it was the ugliest car on the planet and it cost more. I was unaware of the new Chevrolet Malibu at the time. After adding around 27,000 Miles annually on the car, I am ready to put it for sale due to it subpar performance, as well as a lack of comfort. I know, I bought this car for commuting, but I expect to get a little more out of the I4 Engine than I currently receive.

Hyundai stands behind their cars like no other company, and the built quality shows. This car is built to last at least 100,000 miles with minimal repairs.

<TEXT>Wish I had the V6. However, I got a great performing 162hp 4 cyl. w/ excellent MPG and price paid was below invoice. Cost savings offset my preference of V6. I must be a performance oriented driver. 2nd wish: Stiffer suspension. I'm not looking for stiff suspension. I would prefer variable rate resistance that increases when the springs and shocks reach compression. It would improve cornering on rounded on-ramps. Interior noise levels could be quieter. Depending on road surface, noisier than expected on anything but smooth surface roadways. Still, satisfactory. Overall, a GREAT car. The foregoing are acceptible consequences of car's budget orientation. Terrific car!Happy overall.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1. Quality fit and finish 2. Loaded! Even has heated seats. 3. Great performance(162hp)for a 4 cyl 4. Great fuel economy. 400-415 miles on a full tank. 5. Leather is nice 6. XM radio 7. Style 8. Comfortable 9. Roomy - similar to 2002 Mercedes E300</FAVORITE>

I know this is cheesy but I like the fact that it has a Tire Pressure warning... most cars has this as a standard feature in 08 but I think it's pretty cool. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After renting cars for the weekends for six months, and thereby driving a lot of cars extensively, I purchased Sonata. And I'm happy I did it. I got a GLS with all options included, for $18500 (including 7.75% tax). The nearest rival in the same category, in terms of features and ride quality, would have been a Camry SE. That'd be $6000 more, at least. I've driven the following cars extensively ('tested' them as my potential next car): Civic, Accord, Corolla, Camry, Malibu, Cobalt, Maxima, Sentra, 9-3, Sebring, PT Cruiser, Caliber, Avenger, Elantra etc. and found Sonata delivers the most for the price. maxima and 9-3 have far superior ride and handling, but costs a whole lot more.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's been four weeks since we bought our fourth Hyundai, and I still can't believe how much we're enjoying it. Whisper quiet, smooth power and handling without being vague, incredible gas mileage, supreme comfort, endless features, dual exhaust. Showed it to Nana, and she went right out and traded her Civic for a four cyl. Sonata! You can complain, or just buy a Hyundai and be happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought this car for less than 2 months, and wanted to get rid of it everyday. There are several problems: (a) a lot of rattles on the front side of the car. This is ridiculous for a car with only 1500 miles, and says something about its build quality. (b) the infamous rear suspension problem seems not fixed even for this 2008 model. When I drive it at a imperfect road at 30-40 mph, I simply cannot bear it. I have to choose a longer route to work because of this problem. (c) when the oil tank is full, it makes noises, and the dealership told me that the cure is not to get a full tank. Will I buy a hyundai again? you bet not. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the 3rd Hyundai I have owned since 1999. The first 2 were great cars. I got the GLS 4 cylinder with the 5 speed manual trans. Even though this is the cheapest model it still comes with all the safety features as standard. The car drives great, quiet and smooth. Very comfortable and roomy. I am getting 32 MPG with this car, I guess the 5 speed helps here. I averaged 35 MPG with my much smaller Elantra. This is excellent economy for such a large car. Pretty quick for a four cylinder too. I love the stereo, burned a CD with 125 MP3's and the stereo played them perfectly. Just a great value in a mid size car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great combination of comfort, performance and economy. Nice build quality. Good Stereo that plays MP3's. Love the styling too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I think this car is a good value with 0% financing. However, I am very disappointed with the passenger airbag occupant detection system. There is a sensor in the passenger seat that is supposed to detect if an adult is sitting in the seat so that the computer can determine whether or not the passenger airbag should inflate in a collision. The problem is that the system is very inconsistent and sometimes will turn off the airbag even when a heavy adult is sitting in the seat. Hyndai knows the problem and the owners manual tells you to keep restarting the engine to clear the problem, which can't be good for your starter. The other work around is to have the front passenger move to rear!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Good power, great handling, I don't know what they are referring to saying the handling isn't very good, I love it. Had a Honda before this and this tops the Honda head over heels. XM radio is awesome and the infinity sound system blows people away. Gas mileage is about 25 mpg average between city and freeway. I drive mostly in the city, so i think that 23 mpg in the city is pretty good. About 31 on the freeway. All in all a great ride and I would highly recommend!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a fun to drive and very comfortable. It is a quite, soft ride with decent gas performance, although i wish it were better for a 4 cylinder (23-31) I'm averaging mid 20's since Nov '07. This exterior of this car is stylish with black and silver the best looking, imo. Interior is nice, but basic and thus economical. Dont forget all that free safety engineered into this car. I like the size of the car and the space. Tons of leg room and truck space. Comfy seats. Stellar 4 disc brakes, smooth ride on great tires, and nice handling. I dont like certain plastic interior parts, seat belts are awkwardly placed, cup holder doesnt hold cups well, key fob gets poor signal. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My first car I drove was a Hyundai Excel. What a nightmare driving that thing! In less than 20 years, Hyundai is truly a quality manufacturer, and it shows in their cars such as the Sonata. The Sonata is comparable to the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord, but costs thousands less. Plus you get the best warranty out there. It's truly a 'best buy' in my opinion. Every time I drive it, I almost forget that I'm driving a Hyundai. It has a smooth supple ride, acceleration is sufficient (although the engine buzzes a bit at higher RPMs), it handles and brakes well, and it's quiet inside. It can easily seat five adults, and the trunk is huge. Enough said.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely love this car. I owned a 2000 Hyundai Elantra until I literally killed it. I didn't like the look of the new Elantras so I looked at the Sonata. I LOVE it. It's safe, reliable, beautiful to look at... I can't say enough good things about this car. I put 4500 miles on it in 3 months. The XM is a lifesaver in traffic (I live in DC). I really can't explain how safe I feel in this car. The warranty is fabulous. We go on a lot of road trips and the new car hasn't let us down yet. It's roomy enough for me, my boyfriend, the cello and the great dane.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looks, feels, rides great but soon after leaving lot noticed gas gauge dropping below empty. Wasn't even sure I could make it to the next gas station as it continued to drop. Made it though. Next day, Passenger airbag light off message came on. Third day, light comes on even though I am the only person in the car. Forth day, I look up the issue and see it is a long- standing issue with Hyundai's that apparently hasn't been fixed yet. First week isn't over yet and I don't feel good about my quick two strikes...?</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first hyundai. No problems so far but I will keep my fingers crossed. Just had it for a month though. Some low quality plastics in the interior. Even my 93 camry and 89 civic had better materials. So you can't compete with camcords, but then again I didn't want to pay 7 grands extra for camcord anyway. Highway ride is smooth, city driving is not bad either except for fuel economy and a little harsh ride on bigger bumps. No engine noise, tire noise is bearable and so is the wind noise. We had a wind storm the other day and some gusts were blowing even more than 50 miles per hour and I didn't feel any cross winds except for wind noise.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently bought a 2007 Audi A4 for 30K dollars. Nice car and I love it. Went to the Hyundai dealer recently and bought a 2008 Limited Sonata for my recently widowed mother. WOW! The Sonata is a VERY nice vehicle! The fit and finish is impeccable, and the V6 has plenty of pep. The exterior lines and dual exhausts are quite attractive. The 5 year warranty and standard safety features, along with Hyundai's vastly improved record for quality (JD Power reports) nearly sold the vehicle by themselves. Having driven it, I can't help but think I overpaid for my Audi! The leather seats, quality components and user- friendly controls are nearly on par with my A4. Hyundai hit this one out of the park!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fit and finish. No sqeaks or rattles. Feels very comfortable and solid. The V6 will scat. Appearance, inside and out, is sporty but refined. Few family sedans are as attractive when viewed from behind. The standard safety features provide peace of mind. Trunk is HUGE. Every detail says QUALITY. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first foreign car (whatever that means). I needed a commuter car and looked at Camry, Accord and Altima. The Sonata provided the best value, mileage is a little less than advertised but overall I really like this car. The limited package has most of the bells and whistles. The engine provides more power than I expected but when you "punch" it at speed it feels like a four cylinder (about what you expect). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The stereo system is great and the XM feature is nice. Handling is good and interior layout is nice. Seating room in back is pretty good, I am tall and it is better than most.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My mother purchsed a V6 2007 Sonata because of the safety features (she is 85). She let me borrow the car for a few trips and I fell in love with it. With the offer of 0% financing I decided to trade in my 1999 Taurus and purchase one for myself. I decided to go with the inline 4 instead of the V6 because of the threat of ever increasing gas prices. In the short time that I have had the car, I haven't regretted going for the 4. It gives me the performance and gas milage that I was looking for.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall quality and safety. Through my job I have rented a number of cars over the last 9 months and smooth and quite ride of the Sonata in quite impressive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am a mechanical engineer and did extensive research before buying a car. I keep my cars for 10+ years and wanted something with longevity. My previous car was an infinty G20t and I thought I wanted the new G35, but I simply could not justify spending $35k on a new car, when I am planning on going back to school next year. The Hyundai is SO comfortable! I LOVE THE SOUND SYSTEM~! I wouldn't call it the 'sportiest' car, but at this point in my life, I'm enjoying a softer ride. The warranty and features are UNBEATABLE for the cost. I am so pleased I was able to get all the features of a luxury car for so much less! I bought my new Sonata through Costco and got a great price. </TEXT>
