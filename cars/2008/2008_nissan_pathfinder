<TEXT>Very pleased with the purchase. Feels almost like a luxury SUV, except for half the cost. Only mechanical issue I've had was a loose heat shield that took an hour to fix at service dept. Some controls could be arranged better, and definitely should have another 2 inches to move the driver's seat back (i'm 6'2). not uncomfortable - just can't stretch my leg out completely. i haven't second guessed myself for buying this, and i doubt i ever will.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I should love this car. It's loaded with options and I got a great price on it. The problem is you get what you pay for. The quality just isn't there. The engine is noisy and unrefined. The transmission occasionally shifts slowly or roughly and makes we wonder how many problems it will have down the road. The interior already looks like it's 10 years old. The plastics aren't aging well and the leather is starting to sag. Also, an annoying clicking sound has developed, in addition to all the other interior squeaks and rattles. The ride is a rough and the whole vehicle shakes when going over bumps. To be fair, it is an suv but I previously had a 4runner and it drove a lot better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bose stereo is pretty good. Heated seats and heated outside mirrors are great during the winter. Back up camera is exremely useful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Initially, I loved my pathfinder. The v8 was so powerful, the bose sound is amazing and all the gadgets and luxury are great. However, after about 2 weeks, I noticed the rattles and I mean everywhere. When I hit a bump I feel it in the wheel and in the frame. The doors rattle the dash rattles bad! I took it off road and it was like driving a covered wagon. The rattles are so noticeable. I had a 2000 pathfinder with 100k on it and nothing like this. It was solid as a rock. The a patty is a great highway car and great 0-60 speed, which is outstanding. However, i bought an suv to use for off road and mtn sports. It has low clearance with the bumpers and it rattles way too much. It</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great speed and towing. I loved the shiftable transmission. The technology and luxury is great! However, the off road is disappointing. This car is more like a sportscar/crossover versus an suv. You feel bumps on and off road</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having gone from a Ford Explorer LXT to a Mercedes ML280, ML350, and Land Rover LR3, I had my doubts about the Nissan. I can honestly say, the Nissan is built as well if not better than my German and English rides, and has held up admirably to a variety of highway, winter, dirt roads, and trails. Only trouble has been limited to dead battery when the headlight "auto-off" feature stopped on occasion leaving technicians scratching their heads, and a faulty doorlock on passenger door made it impossible to exit vehicle from the back seat. Mild valve noise has appeared at 36K miles but too early to tell if this is meaningful. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle new in July 2009. I was unable to locate a 2009, there were none in all of Las Vegas. The first thing I noticed about the vehicle that was between 42 to 45 miles per hour upon removing my foot from the gas and then reapplying the vehicle bumped forward. It seems that the transmission shifted with a bump. I immediately read these reviews and found that many people experienced the same thing and that Nissan wasn't doing anything about it. I contacted Nissan Corp. and they stated they knew nothing of problem. I scheduled an appointment with my dealership who found prior alert from Nissan and fixed my vehicle with module part. No more bumping.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched mid-sized SUVs for about six months before deciding to buy my Pathfinder. My comparisons were "whittled" down to the T4R, Acura MDX and NPF. Considering the MDX was about 10K more than I wanted to spend....then there were two. What ultimately made my decision easy was the financing Nissan offered and to date have not been disappointed. I only have about 7K miles on it and have not yet experienced any of the transmission "clunking" stated by other reviewers. One thing I'm keeping an eye/ear on is the amount of engine vibration that exists between 4K and 5K RPM. It seems to smooth out closer to the redline. Extremely happy so far however...</TEXT>

<TEXT>Build quality of a tank! The power and "tightness" makes it feel like your driving an unstoppable machine. This is the best vehicle I've owned. The luxury interior is awesome and has every thing you can want on a car (le version). Gas mileage isn't good (12.9), but if a cared I would have gotten a hybrid. Electic 4x4 is great never misses a beat locking in or catching it in auto. Suspension is great and the breaks are ultra smooth. Don't compare the v6 to the v8. Though they look alike there completely different I have driving both. The v6 is a wanna be, the v8 is the real deal.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle after reading reviews on how good this vehicle was and on advice from other people - worse mistake I have made regarding a vehicle purchase. Picked up the car and within 35 miles the check engine light came on, took it back to the service department, they said they fixed it and 35 miles later, the check engine light was back on - stayed in the shop almost 2 weeks. Have had it home 1 month and it is back in the shop now because of some other problem. I've had this car less than 2 months and it's been in the shop more than I've had it home!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well built vehicle, typical Nissan workmanship and design in the build. Very happy with the power to weight. Gets up and goes for a vehicle in this class. As another contributor stated and I have to agree I too like the "throaty" sound with acceleration. Great towing power and good off road handling with the 4x4. On the downside I think the tires are too soft for the vehicle weight and at highway speed it is very sloppy and wanders. I too experience what seems like tranny lurching on downhill grades but I found if I turned the cruise off it stopped. Seems as vehicle gets driven more it is better - not sure what that is all about. During servicing I have brought that issue to dealership.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Pros: Rugged interior makes for a easier clean when you have dogs in the back. The whole back cargo area of my SE has a rubber/plastic type floor and walls that make dog hair in the vehical a lot more manageable. Doors open really wide and the doorway is nice and wide/tall (great for loading and unloading kids from car seats! Two sets of rear vents that help keep your kids/dogs at the same temperature as you (I hated in my Jeep GC SUV that I would be boiling in the front with the heat and my daughter would be freezing in the second row with no vents). 3 rows of seats are real handy if you ever are in a bind and need to move some extra kids. Backup camera is great with kids/dog</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 6th Nissan/Datsun and my 2nd Pathfinder, In just a few short months I have managed to put on approx. 3000 miles and have driven in some of the worst winter driving conditions I can remember. I had the opportunity to drive from Northern Alberta through the Rockies to Vancouver shortly after I took delivery of my new Pathfinder. The V8 power, all wheel drive and luxury appointments made for a great trip and despite the blinding snowstorm and icy conditions it was a very reassuring knowing I was driving a Pathfinder. No problems and the handling was excellent along the way. I can hardly wait until summer. By the way gas mileage was above my expectations as was price vs value. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated steering wheel, seats, shifttronic, all-wheel drive, sound system, display and all around luxury appointments. Power and handling were exceptional as was the traction control system.

<TEXT>We bought the 2008 Pathfinder having in mind we travel to Mexico at least once a year and we needed a vehicle reliable on seriously hard roads. This one didn't disappoint. Its off road ability it's outstanding. Plenty of power for anybody and decent fuel economy. On the city, it delivers a quiet and smooth drive. With nearly 16000 miles on it, I haven't had the so much mentioned rough down shift issue other users reported. For me, it's the perfect mix. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven this SUV for 1400 miles and wanted to let your readers know what a great vehicle this is. The ride is very smooth and very quiet but powerful. We wanted a vehicle that was safe for Michigan winters so we chose a 4x4. We wanted to be able to move out on the freeway and this has a lot of power off the block as well as when you need to pass. We need a quiet interior as we do a lot of business in the car and it is super quiet. The majority of the driving I have done is in town and I am pleased to be getting 18.1 miles per gallon. My husband just loves the look of it. It's beefy but still easy for me to get in and out of.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned it about 6 months and put 16,000 miles on it. It has been an excellent ride and problem free. I got the loaded version and it has been totally worth it. The voice recognition works really well and the navigation system is excellent. I didn't realize that I would like the keyless feature as much as I have. I've gotten so lazy that it now irritates me to have to get my key out when I drive my other car. It has a lot of nice touches both inside and out and I have absolutely no buyer remorse!</TEXT>

Traded in my '05 350z for my Pathy, and I'm not one bit sorry. Was looking at the 4runner, but that interior was archaic. The Pathfinder is smooth, has a great leather interior, awesome handling and the rear view cam on the SE is GREAT! 3rd row stays folded down - we don't need it, and it's laughable anyhow. We bought the dog-cage divider and rubber mat for the cargo room aftermarket; exceptional car for the money -- we are VERY pleased with it! No tranny prob here (yet!)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded a 2004 Isuzu Rodeo S for my '08 Pathfinder so right off the top I was immediately impressed. The exterior styling is commanding yet sleek; great ground clearance; and I was pretty pleased that the hitch was standard on the one I bought. I've seen some Pathfinders around with these weird contoured pinstripes, but mine doesn't have that fortunately. Even for a base model I was pleased with the remote keyless entry, power windows, locks and tint. It rides much smoother than my Rodeo (and the Lincoln Aviator and Acura MDX which I've driven), but not quite as nice as the Lexus GX470. The rear seats are a bit tight, but we just put the kids back there anyway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very impressed with this vehicle. V8 is powerful and surprisingly economical. Interstate Hwy driving at 78 mph at barely 2000 RPM and getting 18.6 mpg is great for me. I pulled a trailer home at a safer slower 70 mph and still got 17.5 mpg. Nimble as my 2001 Cherokee and as powerful as my 2005 Titan. I would not have bought if the Pathfinder SE did not have the V8. I found one of the last ones they made in the SE model. I'm 65 and have seen gas prices go up and down many times. This is a good time to buy. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Big V8 engine with DOHC and 32 valves. Great engine. Beats all the Detroit powerhouse engines hands down in low speed torque, reliability, service life, and economy. V8 drive train is excellent and I think gas mileage will be same as V6 with proper driving technique.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Was choosing between this and 4Runner. Chose Pathfinder because of option availability and price. At 7000 miles headliner (ceiling) started falling out. Took to dealer and they replaced the entire ceiling. Second ceiling was full of creases and looked far worse so it went back for a third time. They had it for five days and it came back with many faults. Stains on sunroof, ill-fitting, scratched, and broken trim. I am waiting new parts on back order so it can go back again and they can fix all the interior bits they broke. It will never be right again.</TEXT>

I still sometimes surprise myself with its power when I pull out into Atlanta traffic. the V6 has plenty of power, don't regret not getting the V8. Overall, I love this car until I have to fill it up! I'll probably go back to a smaller car or wagon next time given the price of gas.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I don't know why I bought it in the first place - it just had everything I needed at the time (7 passenger and still had storage room). But I've never been impressed with how it handles. Hit a pot hole and the thing feels like you could lose control. Lots of air bags and feels solid - think it would survive a crash okay. But there is something about hitting potholes. It's very roomy and I love the interior. Huge display screen is great! Only other bad thing is the gas mileage. A year ago that wasn't a problem for me. Now I'm having second thoughts. At only 16 mpg, it certainly isn't cheap. </TEXT>

Therefore I have had ample opportunities to evaluate it and am on the whole satisfied with this SUV. Being a previous Toyota sedan owner, I was choosing between the 4runner and Pathfinder. I feel completely comfortable with the choice I made as the 4runner did not feel luxurious enough from inside and had horrible 3rd row seating option.

<TEXT>I had to go out and drive my Pathfinder to see what everyone is talking about vis-a-vis the transmission. Basically it clunks if you go on and off the gas when travelling around 40mph. I drive with a smooth throttle foot so I never noticed it. My wife, on the other hand, drives with a continuous throttle-on-throttle-off style so I'd imagine that she would elicit that type of transmission behavior, but she would never notice it because, well, frankly she's mechanically clueless. Thankfully I drive it 90% of the time so I don't think we'll need to replace the transmission, u-joints, or rear diff anytime soon.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heck, even with the base model you get power steering, power brakes, power windows, power mirrors, A/C, and a radio. What more do you need? We live on an island, so fancy stuff like nav is useless - we already know our way around. The only option we got was the side curtain airbags, just in case.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our first Nissan after having two Toyotas. Big mistake for switching brands. Currently has 2,700 miles. The transmission at around 40 mph in and out of 5th gear starts bucking when you're on and off the gas. The windows rattle when they are down about 2 inches to halfway down. The service manager and Nissan engineer said they never heard of these problems before, what a joke. I showed them several of these reviews they had no comment.

<TEXT>It came down to the PF or 4runner. The V8 swayed me. The overall power is staggering. I love the handling and quiet interior at top speeds. I am impressed by all of the features that come with the model. I did not opt for nav, and am a bit disappointed that bluetooth was not available w/o this feature. Also dissapointed that the iPod (MP3) is a line level (dull hum introduced from speakers), and does not allow for character display on the huge screen. Vehicle performance is outstanding. Gas mileage a bit scary, but I knew what I was getting into. Hoping Bush's replacement will help us out. Like the stereo, but would be more pleased with flexibility to manipulate tones (make sub work harder.)</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Nissan. First off, I love the looks and design of the unit. After my first road trip with the unit 1500 miles I started experiencing the dreaded torque converter problem you will read about. It has lived at the dealer for weeks while they an Nissan diagnosed the problem. The long and short, there is no known cure for these symptoms. 30-45 MPH (5th gear) torque converter clunks with slightest variation in RPM (up and down). Worse yet is that at highway speeds (cruise on) down a hill, it happens over and over again (worse). Now 15000+ miles, can't stand to drive the truck because of the clunking. Make sure that you keep on the dealer for a fix! This condition is not right!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd. Had an '01 (my favorite), an '05 and just picked up an '08. Was initally looking for something bigger & w/side airbags standard, but for price, value & fun-to-drive I was back to the Pathfinder. Found an SE w/ side airbags which came loaded minus the leather seats. I've had others including Cherokee and Volvo XC90 - Pathfinder has the best performance(very fast!), character, and lots of storage. Many of the materials on the '08 seem better than '05, the cabin's quieter and the wheels/tires are larger, so it's a slightly different ride. Doesn't seem to corner quite as well, but the '01 handled the best. The thick steering wheel feels just right, and the truck is easy to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Wide opening doors, gobs of storage, & the long list if standard options. The new screen/center stack is far better than the last one and mostly intuitive. I like the soft ride that doesn't compromise too much handling. Feels like this truck will go anywhere.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in an '04 T4R Sport with a V8 for this and I'm very happy. Having two T4Rs ('00 + '04) I was wary getting a Nissan but it's been a blast (so far). The V8 is extremely powerful yet is very thirsty (13-14 mpg in mixed driving) and likes premium fuel. Thankfully I have a very short commute. Interior is nicely laid out. Love the premium package features (back-up cam), stereo sounds good, iPod hook-up, automatic 4x4, dual-zone AC, etc. However, heated side mirrors should not be only for the leather pkg. Lame. Handles well but the T4R with X-REAS handled much better in turns. I too have the problems w/ the power seat controls getting touched while exiting the truck. It's a p.i.t.a.</TEXT>

But everything else about this vehicle is great. It is extremely responsive both in acceleration and manueverability. And it is a very comfortable road car. The only real drawback about this vehicle is that (I didn't do my homework) it requires premium gasoline. Oh, it will run "ok" on mid-range - but it's worth pointing out. It's otherwise a solid car and I would buy another one. Oh yes, spend the extra money and get the sunroof. It will be even more fun to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been experiencing the same issue of bucking/thumping at or around 40mph. When lightly pressing the gas pedal the vehicle shakes or shudders but only around that speed. A senior tech witnessed the problem and said NIssan is working on it , but it had to get cleared by EPA. Not happy with this 08. Very disappointed in Nissan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We test drove a Chevy Tahoe, a Toyota 4Runner, a Toyota Highlander, and a Nissan Pathfinder. The Pathfinder had styling, comfort, and plenty of room inside. The only negative factor we've discovered is that it tends to wander at speeds above 60 mph. No problem with transmission as described by other owners.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the navigation system (wouldn't consider buying a Pathfinder without it). EXTREMELY comfortable and fun to drive. 19 MPG city - 23 MPG highway. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this vehicle mid 07, only problem I've had is the factory installed sat. radio was doa. Other than that every thing is working fine w/ 18000+ miles. Avg. 16 mpg, with mostly in traffic highway miles. Plenty of power, very smooth ride. Off road quite a bit, ground clearance is a limiting factor. Interior is nice, but not overly fancy. Plenty of room in the front and mid seats, I'm 6'1". Nav system is very nice, minus some features are not available when you are in motion.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The stereo/nav are quite nice. Musicbox, and CF card reader are great on long drives. Smart Key.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I read lots of reviews and felt comfortable with this truck, but my transmission does the same thing as some of the others here. I wish I would have dug further. The left passenger door handle is broken (I've had the truck less than two weeks) and there are several interior squeaks and rattles. I was spoiled with a 97 4runner that was bulletproof (not a squeak), but the current generation is late in its design cycle, so I steered away. I also had a great experience with my 01 Maxima, which led me to stay with Nissan. I have my doubts about the longevity of this Pathfinder, and I hope there's a recall soon for the transmission. Time will only tell if I made a mistake straying from the 4runner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded my '04 Envoy XL for PF SE V8 and absolutely love it! Didn't want to leave GMC, but their replacement (Acadia) is way overpriced and not appealing. The PF looks better, is a better ride, and has plenty of room for 3 toddler seats and 1 infant car seat. The V8 is very powerful and accelerates quickly. Standard features are great, and the option packages (Premium and Side Airbags) were all we needed. I haven't had any transmission or shifting concerns with 4,500 miles on this PF.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The truck drives great, both in the city and on dirt/gravel paths. The interior flexibility of the third and second row seats are nice. For even more additional room the front passenger seat lays flat as well. This truck contains a V6 4.0L, runs smooth and the cabin noise is relatively quite on the highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a 2008 Nissan last October. While it has a much quieter and smoother ride than my previous SUV (a Trailblazer), I don't think it's worth the price tag I paid - my fault. The 'check engine' light came on THREE weeks after I purchased it - took dealer 2 weeks to order and replace the part. Can't quite get over this issue to enjoy the car just yet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchase this vehicle and notice a very hard downshifting and bucking when I start to accelerate at about 40 mph. The dealer put in some transmission fluid and told me that would fix the problem. It didn't. I took it back a second time and had the shop manager drive it with me. They kept my vehicle for 1 day and then told me that there was nothing wrong with it. When I told them to give that to me in writing they said that there was something wrong and that they wanted to keep the vehicle longer. They also told me that they have 6 more pathfinders on the lot with the same problem. I am still waiting for it to be fixed. It now downshifts hard at all different speeds. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Some good things some not so good about this car. Not as much room in the driver seat as I had on my 2000 XTerra, which was disappointing for a larger vehicle. Stereo is TERRIBLE- I had a better one that came with my 1980 Datsun station wagon. Worst thing is you can't really upgrade. If you do you will lose all of the information that goes to the little screen - temp, tire pressure, gas mileage, etc. Dealer says I cant upgrade to the navigation unit later- that has to be option ordered from factory up front. But drives nice, is quiet and has more pickup than my 2000 XTerra did.</TEXT>

<TEXT>SUV has very nice features and more than enough power. We bought it on a Saturday, drove it during that weekend and noticed the hard downshifting when letting off the gas pedal at approx 40 MPH. Took it back to dealer Monday and service person rode with us. He said that there was a sensor that needed to be replaced. This did not fix our problems. The service dept said there is no fix at this time. They still do not have a solution.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Pathfinder for a little more than 2 weeks. Absolutley love it. The engine is a monster, just plain fun to drive! Gas mileage is what's expected. If people are concerned about gas mileage, then stay away from higher displacement engines... nuff said. If people want to complain about the legroom in the third row, upgrade to a bigger car. I have yet to sit in the third row of any midsize SUV and feel comfortable. It just comes with the territory. I am more than satisfied with my purchase, and hope to have this car for years to come.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The only thing that I was hesitant about prior to purchase was the poor mileage reports for the Pathfinder, both V6 and V8. My 2008 Pathfinder S 4x4, 4.0L V6 automatic after the first 3 tanks averaged 18.2 mpg in the city. This is what the in-dash computer was telling me but I didn't believe it until I crunched the numbers after each fillup. Much better than I expected. This is in-town driving with maybe 10 to 20% expressway. I'm fairly light-footed and you can tell a difference if you put your foot into it but I'm not nursing it either. This is a superb SUV for the money. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Towing capacity! Interior well planned. Third seat standard is a big plus. Like the easy lift hatchback. My deal and drive comparison was the 2008 SR5 4Runner which didn't stack up. Also like this Pathy better than my 2003 Tacoma D cab.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the most Pathfinder I'm waiting for years with new, exellent interior layout and comfortable functions. Lots of standard features on LE model that are options on another makes. The most thing I wish Nissan to improve on this model is transmission. It has noticeable upshifts and downshifts, changes when I press or release gas pedal just right above 40 mph.This is very annoying if you are driving in town. Other than that this is a good and fun suv to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After giving the Pathfinder a thorough test drive on a cold, rainy day (hard acceleration, hard braking, cornering, lane changing, U turn etc.) I decided to trade in my Lexus RX 330. Since my other car is a Z, I wanted to still have good performance with 4x4 capabilities. After taking the Pathfinder to the mountains on the weekend I?m even happier with my decision. The engine is powerful and responsive. The suspension provides a comfortable ride. The view of the road is excellent. The sound system is great. The cabin is quite and the instrumentation is great. I especially like the navigation system and the link to live traffic. All in all a most excellent vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This not only my first Pathfinder, but my first Nissan. After ten years of driving my old '97 Dodge Dakota it was time for something new. I'm not big on gadgets, so the S trim was perfect for me. I was amazed by everything that came standard on the base model. I had to get the SLT package on my old Dakota for these features. The V6 actually produces 31 HP more than the 5.2L V8 in my Dakota and I only gave up 12 pound feet of torque. The Pathfinder is a pleasure to drive and handles great. It corners better than my old Dakota. The towing power is a major plus. 6000 Lbs is more than enought to pull my 5X8 trailer with a full load. I would buy another Pathfinder in a heartbeat.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The dashboard layout is very nice and well thought out. The center console is nice too. I really love the adjustable drivers seat. I hate electric seats, so the manual adjustments are perfect for me.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought a 2008 Pathfinder SE V6 4x2 on Friday night. Very easy for me to drive (I'm 5' tall) and my husband has no problems and he's a foot taller. The adjustable pedals and power driver's seat help with both of us driving this vehicle. It has tons of seating configurations. The front passenger seat folds flat if you get the cloth option, but won't fold flat with the leather option. Good for us because we buy long pieces of PVC and lumber on occasion. If you have small kids (our youngest is 5), step rails help immensely (and they help me being so short) with getting in and out of the Pathfinder. Overall, very happy!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Drives great initially, but after about 4k miles, you'll notice a very pronounced vibration in the steering at highway speeds. Sometimes it's so severe you can barely control the car. Lots of others have this problem if you search Google, and there's no resolution at the dealership. Just plain bad engineering on this one. Wish I had known before buying.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Nissan really had to step up on the design of the interior this year. Nissan has always designed a beautiful car and SUV but when you open the doors you kept thinking what went wrong. This is my 3rd Pathfinder in 3 year. All I can say is that the redesign is great as well as the interior. The performance of the V6 is great! There is a lot of get up and go! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The whole SUV, probably the nav, the lay of center console. The seating in the front seat is great. The performance of the Pathfinder is great. I ski and snowboard so I can't wait to take her to Mammoth this year to see how she does!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When you take your foot off the accelerator just above 40 mph, the car downshifts with a noticeable thump. Then when you press the accelerator again, it upshifts with the same noticeable thump. It is so aggravating that I would not have bought the vehicle if I had known. I took it back to the dealer, they tested another 2008 and said that it was "normal." I did not have this problem in my 2005 at all. They said it was because they put a dual torque converter in the 2008 model. Also, it seems to be harder on gas than the 2005. And when I filled up the first time, I noticed a sticker on the inside of the gas cap door that reads "For best results, use premium gas." The 2005 did not say this.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The new console. It has a lot of programmable features and a lot of monitoring features like tire pressure. The HVAC system is better. The stereo system is better than the 2005.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this V8 vehicle to tow a covered trailer, ~3500 lbs thru mountains. Initial trip saw 14 MPG overall, with excellent power (acceleration and cruising), braking, and stability. Very comfortable (front seats). Very manueverable (vs Armada). Negatives: cramped rear seating, noisy cooling fan, rear squat (no air suspension option as on Armada). Also, folding middle center seat interferes with opening center console, also conceals rear air controls. However, overall very pleased, and exceeded my expectations. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking at the Lexus RX 350 for months along with other SUVs but I finally decided to get the 2008 SE Pathfinder. After looking at options and the price of the 08 Pathfinder I figured I could not go wrong with this purchase. There is a big difference between the 08 to the 07 so don't be fooled. I got the SE loaded out with the leather package and premium sound. I also got tint thrown in and went with the extended warranty with tire replacement. I have had it for about a week and love the car and the ride. If you get an SE model, make sure you get a cargo mat, the rubber tends to scratch up easily. </TEXT>
