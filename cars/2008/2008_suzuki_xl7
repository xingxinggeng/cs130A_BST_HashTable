<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle with 9800 miles. It now has 22,000 miles after 7 months. My wife owns an RX 300 and I have had Saabs for 25 years. Previous to that I had a Corvette and Volvo and my most recent vehicle was a fully loaded Montana mini-van. I mention this in way of letting you know my past experience as a way of evaluating my judgment. This XL7 is a remarkable vehicle. It has performed flawlessly. Is is very fast because of the horsepower, torgue and perfect match to an excellent transmission. Braking is excellent. Road handling is superb. (My son had trouble keeping up with me in his Subaru WRX on a curvy road.) The XL7 wants to run at 80 mph, is very quiet and has a smooth ride. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration. Roadhandling. Ride. Sound system. Controls on steering wheel. Headlights (strength and looks). Cargo space (I took out the third row seats!). Exterior looks (metallic brown).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I knew I had to have the XL7 as soon as my husband and I test drove it!! I love the room it has inside. The third row is so convenient. The storage is great and it rides really good. My daughter even loves it! Not too big and not too small. Perfect size for the three of us. Had no trouble out of it so far. I LOVE my XL7!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I picked up a used 2008 xl7 with 28000 miles for about 14,500 reviews were ok so i decided to buy it. So far the suv is pretty good i have a little complaint about a noise when you turn and a couple of little stuff but not major. Finish on this vehicle is not the best everything is plastic and feels cheap. But on the bright side it rides very well decent fuel economy (24) on the highway and for the price you cant beat it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one of the best vehicles I have ever owned over my 50 years+ of driving easy to drive very good petro mileage considering the size of the vehicle the boot holds a great deal of luggage for holiday trips. The instrument panel is very well laid out. The bonnet has easy access. The vehicle performed extremely well over our 4,600 mile trip. I highly recommend this xl7 any gripes? yes; backing up the vehicle takes some getting used to. Really could use back-up sensors!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first Suzuki purchase and have not been disappointed with it. It excels in room, power and functionality. Too bad Suzuki dropped it from their line up, some upgrades to the interior and better tires (bridgestone - above average noise) can make this an A+ buy. Looks good on the outside and comfortable interior. Rear seats are not for adults, but perfect for little ones, specially in seat restraint. Audio system is standard GM, very average. Mileage has been around 22.4 hwy and 14 in the city. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the second Xl7 I have owned and I bought my current xl7 new in 2008. I have had it for a little over a year and it has been back to the dealership 7 times. There is something faulty with the gas cap and the check engine light will come on and stay on. To replace the air filter is $50 to replace the Hepa Filter is $72. The arm the helps fold the back seats down has come apart twice. Very dissappointed. I was going to trade it in and found out that the Kelly Blue book value is $9000 I paid $22000</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>From the outside the car looks nice and drives very well. The cargo area is huge when the seats and down. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have driven, for the past ten years Saabs, and before that, Mercedes. When it was time to replace my 9 5 Saab station wagon, I looked around. By chance I rented an XL7 for a weekend to haul some things, I fell in love with the car, smooth, powerful, compfortable, stylish, and well finished. Also, the price was great, with 4600 miles, paid 60% of list. This is a great car, in a little over a month have put on 4,000 miles, and they have been much more enjoyable than in my Saab or Mercedes. Great, great car! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The little things, the six dash CD player, the lights coming on when you do the remote lock release. The small pad besides the keys. The solid ride, no sway, or feeling of floating. Automatic climate control, living in a cold climate I am looking forward to the winter to try out the AWD. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this car for two weeks and I have put $130.00 in it driving just in town which is an average of 24 Miles per day. It evaporates the gas, took it in to Suzuki and they found nothing wrong. Saw another Lady at church and she asked me if my car drank allot of gas.I said yes,it does she said hers does as well. Same model and year 08 XL7. Needs to be built fuel economic. Uses to much gas. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Before I purchased my Susuki I drove a Lexus RX300. I could not afford to buy another Lexus but wanted all the bells and whistles of my Lexus. I would never thought to have even test drove a Susuki but when I did I was hooked. I knew that I was going to purchase the car. I have two kids and love the 3rd row seating. The storage is great. It has a lot of pep and my husband likes the duel exhaust. I really like the interior. I love the red and white lights. I actually like the window switches in the middle console. I know some people in other reviews did not like that...to each their own. I would at least recommend someone to test drive the Susuki XL7 before making a final purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for an SUV/Cross Over that had lots of room, some bells & whistles, and a nice ride for a good price. After two months of looking I chose the Suzuki XL7. I found a used 2008 with just over 10,000 miles for under $16,000. It has good engine power, huge cargo capacity, and is a pleasure to drive. It has plenty of amenities right down to the padded area below the ignition so your keys won't make noise as they hit the steering column. It's very comfortable and handles great. On a recent trip we averaged 26mpg with the air on for half the trip. We get 17mpg around town. The AWD will come in handy in the winter here in PA. Be sure to test drive one of these before you buy. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>With the two sets of back seats down and the front passenger seat folded down you can fit pipe or lumber up to 9' long. The room inside is unbelievable. The controls for the radio being on the leather covered steering wheel is great. Nice tight steering. Very comfortable seats. Seats 7 when needed </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my XL7 in Dec 08 with 96 miles on it. For the money there is not a better deal. The motor has amazing power and it moves much quicker than you think. In upstate New York the AWD was a must with over 114" of snow a year. I never managed to get it stuck. I never thought of buying a Suk, we where looking at Jeep Commander, after reading reviews I made much better choice. The 3.7 Liter in the Commander was way underpowered. I have 3 kids, its comfortable and fun to drive. I would have spent much more for a similiar SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>No problems with comfort, performance, reliability. Gas milage pretty good for a big SUV. Single CD player is quirky and will have to have it serviced(stops playing and cd won't eject). Purchased at dealer as an Executive use vechicle with 4,600 miles on it. Well kept by user. Overall is pleasant and comfortable to drive. Has good pickup when needed. I generally drive under speed limits on highways to save on gas. Good cargo space. No third row on this one. No complaints. I've owned Hyundai Sante Fe & Nissan Xterra and like this SUV better than both, although the Sante Fe is also a very good value for the price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good driving experience. Gas milage. Well built. Some dash board features are useful like tire pressure indicator and oil percentage indicator when getting low. Heated front seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Suzuki with only 6,000 miles on it and love it so far (have only had it a couple of weeks). I had never looked at a Suzuki before let alone test drive one but once I did I knew it would be the perfect car for my family. It has everything that I want...heated seats...moonroof...and I especially love the jack for mu IPOD..there are a lot of vehicles out there that do not have this feature. I got a really good deal on mine, originally a $30k vehicle. I love the third row seats and the storage compartment in the back floor. The second row seat has plenty of legroom and the seats are raised so it's more comfortable for taller people like myself (5'10). I give this vehicle an A+!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We had been looking at purchasing a car to replace an aging (84K) 2003 Cavalier. Our search took us into used car territory. It turns out that a company in Ohio, which leases these things to rental companies, was trimming the fat due to the economy. Our model had 10400 miles on it and was in service less than twelve months. We need this kind of room. Our other car is a KIA Spectra. Almost monthly, we are on the road to Nashville. Getting stuck in Atlanta traffic will almost be a pleasure. I am over six foot one, and my wife is five ten. There is so much room; and for the price and reliability this machine is unsurpassed. It's an even better deal at the price we paid!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Automatic air conditioning, fold down flat rear seats, incredible head and shoulder room, stereo and cd are more than passable, speed control convenient, and good lighting at night. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car. The first time I seen it I had to have it. We had a Mitsubishi evo and I didn't like the no room in the car. But this car I have room a lot of room. I watch children and I can fit them in my car if I have to go anywhere. This is the best car for me and I love it. The space in the back of the third row can be roomy if you removed the cargo tray. It will be much deeper and give you quite more room. I have noth9 ing negative about this car. I will have it forever.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I read all of the guru's comments as well as consumers. Believe the CONSUMERS. I own BMW's, Hummers2's,Cadillacs,Corvettes and now a GREAT Suzuki XL7. While being a low cost vehicle I purchased one, and found it to be exciting to drive with 33mpg hwy first time driven with exciting performance! Comfortable ride,roomy,and one of the best buy vehicles in the market. The warranty is second to none, and you will be pleased with the cost of purchase too! Sometimes the guru's compare to many cars to really understand what people are looking for. And try and compare apples and oranges. BUY ONE</TEXT>

<TEXT>After looking at many, many choices for an SUV to replace our family Caravan, I had exhausted just about every option and was destined to pay 30K+ for an SUV that had all the options I wanted in a family transport. I happened to glimpse an XL7 while eating at a fast food place one day. I didn't even consider Suzuki as an option, but started doing some research and decided to chose something "out of the box". I have to say I've not been dissapointed. It's been a great SUV and was well within my budget with all the "bells & whistles" a much more expensive Acadia or GMC, Tahoe or Yukon would have been.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the vehicle used with 9K miles on it from the dealer. The car new was 30K and I paid half that. This is my 3rd Suzuki vehicle. Presently still has 2003 XL-7 with 96K(runs great). The car has fantasitc power, smooth tranny and is confortable to drive. The fact that the car is AWD is a big plus in the snow. Interior quality, fit and feel are just fine for me. I have pulled my boat with my 2003 XL7 without a problem and the extra 70+ HP will prove to be a great addition. 22MPG in the highway and about 18MPG around town. At this point I could not be happier.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the sunroof and leather seating. The 3rd row spilt seating tucks away nicely but is there if you need it. Power motor and tranny are great. Exteroir styling a plus along with and long 7yr/100,000 mile warranty.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I upgraded from the Grand Vitara to the XL7 to accommodate our growing family and the extra space in the back is shockingly roomy! I can fit a large baby stroller, suitcases, and dogs all in the back together at once. My husband has even been impressed with the smooth car like ride and roominess. I love the acceleration too! It's power is definitely understated since it moves much better than many other SUVs I've driven. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature is impossible to define. I can't believe all the features the car came with at the price we got it for. I couldn't drive a car without leather seating and steering wheel controls. I got it all in my XL7 and couldn't be happier.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought my 2008 XL7 2 weeks ago. I had been drivng a pickup for the last serveral years. I feel like I am in heaven now drive this new ride. My wife has the SX4 Sport and we love it. Now we have two Suzuki products and do not plan on getting any other for a very long time. Plus I got at a great price. From rebates and customer cash back I am paying less than I was on the truck. And it turns heads. I have had several people ask me about it. I even had a guy in his (Acura SUV)the other day tell me that it was a "very sharp ride man". </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seats are comfortable and the leather feels great. Like warming my backside in the morning on the way to work also. Smooth handling in the city. Great sound system (for stock). Tons of room for hauling anything I would need to. Like the small compartment in the back for storage. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Best bang for the buck, looked at much smaller suv's with zero room behind the supposed 3rd row that's built for a dog or cat, oh and if your kids are in the third row and your hit from behind, good luck! Anyway needed something that the kids or an adult could could actually sit comfortably and with room behind the third row for luggage, groceries, etc. This was it! With the rebates and incentives they took 8k off sticker! You cannot buy anything like this at that price!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been eying the XL7 for some time now. I owned an Aerio SX but I was hit by an elderly woman and it was totaled. I was in Japan for 3 years and all I saw was Suzuki cars every where. Hardly any Hondas. So when i got back to the States I went to the dealership offered $19000 and i drove it off the lot. I have no complaints, rides smooth and it looks good. I would call it a crossover before an SUV. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked for a long time at SUV's and decided not to buy because of price. Saw the XL-7 in a parking lot and thought it looked cool. With incentives I got XL-7 for about $9K less tha a similarly equipped Toyota or Honda. I drove it cross country and averaged 24 mpg while traveling 75 mph. I have had no complaints with fit and trim although engine noise was present during break in. Only thing I would change is the power seats need to be eight way vs six.</TEXT>

Quad 5 Star crash rating too.It's not an Equinox!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powerful 3.6L 252hp drive-by-wire engine - built in Japan. I get 20mpg city/24-28 hwy. Awesome safety features. Beautiful exterior design.

<TEXT>A great value for a seven seater. The usable 2 extra back seats are great for kids yet even small adults. Plus the 2 extra seats have airbags so safety is considered (unlike other SUVs we compared) The inside design is basic and not all that stand-out yet functional. Has a very small front compartment which would be great if bigger. The back viewable area is poor due to the small windows, so I would highly recommend a back up camera system. The turning radius is large making it difficult to make tight turns like most SUVs. Safety features crash test rating are great as well as the warranty. This is probably the least expensive 7 seater mid-size SUV on the market and so far we love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this for my wife who really wanted a Toyota. However the best deal we could find on a similar Toyota was 10K more and they offered 4K less on the trade in. For $14k less I talked her into the Suzuki. I have owned many new cars of about every make and never had one that didn't have anything that needed to be corrected in the first few months. That is until the XL7 absolutly everything was perfect. My wife loves the vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We looked at the Mazda 9, very nice, looked at Honda Pilot/CRV and Toyota RAV and Highlander, and the Hyundai Santa Fe/Veracruz, nice also. But when you compare all of the features and standard stuff, the Suzuki really blows them away. Adding the no deductible, 7 year 100,000 mile warranty, free loan car, that covers exerything except the battery and tires! Even a burned out bulb is covered! Amazing. And the Japanese made GM motor is smooth and powerful, and all the safety stuff gets is a 5 star rating. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a midsize SUV for around 30k, and drove almost all the competition. When I saw the XL7 I figured let me take this for a ride, it really was not high on my list. But after looking at all the features you get for the money, it probably is the best value on the market. It has a solid but smooth ride, great pickup and has nice style both in and out. It has one of the best warranties in the market, very little maintenance. It even has a timing chain, instead of a belt, so you don't have that periodic $500+ expense. Although 7 passengers is a stretch, 5 or 6 can fit fine.</TEXT>
