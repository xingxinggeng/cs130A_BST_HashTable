<TEXT>I often have elderly persons in this vehicle and they have all commented on the comfort of the leather seats and the spaciousness of the cabin. When it's empty & the seats are stowed there's plenty of room for hauling. I traded in an 8cyl Jeep which was seriously noisy; Sienna is quiet by comparison, but still loud on the freeway. I've had it just over 18 months and, knock wood, not a think has gone wrong. Mileage exactly as stated by the manufacturer (not to say it has great mileage but I am saying the advertised MPG is truthful). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sonar is great - it's kept me out of two fender benders. Leather seats are comfortable & easy to clean, good turning radius, love the automatic side & rear doors. Row 3 seat removal is easy; just stow in the floor. Large trunk area when all seats are up. 6- trac CD player, automatic sunroof.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I don't even have any small kids. I have a son playing football 650 miles from home and have driven this van in all kinds of conditions. I haven't had a major problem at all in 40K miles. We got it so loaded up that my friend calls it a "living room on wheels". My dealer is a gem! I developed a little rattle and they took care of it 1-2-3 can gave me a loaner for the day. The car tailgates like a champ. The automatic tailgate is a great convenience when my arms are full. It's the most reliable car (my first Toyota) that I've ever had. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of comfortable room. Love the auto everything - climate control, seat memory (my husband is 6'4" and I'm 5'2"), rear seat folding, etc. Leather seats have worn very well & still look new. SMOOTH highway driving is great on long trips. It has surprising acceleration when you need it. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Toyota Sienna LE engine is very noisy in comparison to my 10 years old Plymouth Grand Voyager. I drove my friend's 2007 Sienna CE, the noise level is exactly the same as the LE: LOUD. The highway road noise is higher than expected. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>No more Toyota fan</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I am not happy with this van. Shortly after new - right out of showroom - things started falling off. On cold days the engine sounds like it is going to blow - dealer says this in normal. Cheap plastic bumpers come loose and have to put back in place. Found nuts, clips etc on the floor. Drivers seat uncomfortable on long trips. No automatic head lights. This van is less than a year old and looks and sounds like it is 5. Cheaper than Kia, Honda and Nissan and now I know why! Will Toyota run and hide again when major issues like engine failure - or after class action lawsuit scares them will they "Voluntarilly" fix problems. I have never heard a new engine sound so bad at start up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>At 19,100 miles, and with regular tire rotation, all four Dunlop tire wear are 4/32. There is something wrong with the tires! I avoided buying a AWD just to avoid premature wearing of tires (Consumers Report). It makes no difference! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I come from a family of minivan users. Of all, the Toyota Sienna is probably the best one we have driven yet. It was priced cheaper than common competitors like the Honda Odyssey and Nissan Quest. The Sienna has outstanding power, it can get to 60 mph no problem (under 7 seconds to be exact!). Unfortunately, my family was involved in a severe accident in February 2009 with this minivan. We rolled over at 40 mph, thankfully nobody was injured. This car is incredibly safe. The stabilizer bars in the roof and doors kept the car very sturdy during the rollover. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Safety, Horsepower, and spacious cabin. If you are looking to buy a minivan, get this one, it is most worth the money. Do not purchase a Honda Odyssey, Dodge Caravan, Chrysler Town & Country or Nissan Quest. The Toyota surpasses those competitors in every category.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This van is well appointed even for the low end model. However, at low speed, the transmission is very slow to shift with a rev that is unnerving. The sliding doors just a few months after purchase have squeaked even though there have been several visits to the dealer. I will be taking my van back to the shop again soon for this problem. If the simple things not being done right bug you. Avoid this vehicle until there is a major redesign. Also there is the interior noise of the engine. I thought I was driving a diesel.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just completed a 2000 mile trip from VA to FL and the van now has almost 7000 miles. The ride and comfort were excellent. The vehicle tends to exhibit a delayed response from the trans at some points. Not sure what that is all about. Still not sure what mileage we got on the road but the city mileage is as advertised. Lots of room in the van and it is much quieter than our 2001 Grand Caravan. Acceleration is also excellent. The laser cruise is accurate but you need to plan your lane changes to accommodate how it operates. Not at all happy that the navigation is not operable when vehicle moves even by passenger. Almost a waste!!! Other than that, we are very pleased with our first Toyota.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sunroof, navigation capabilities (only when stationary - it won't operate by touch), laser cruise, power folding mirrors, quiet ride, audio and entertainment system, household plug outlet </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I had a 2002 Chrysler Town and Country that we traded in for the Sienna. Oh what a power play move!! The Sienna rides way, way better than the Town and Country. Ours is silver shadow pearl. When we bought the Sienna home, our kids went crazy! They immediately fell in love with it. Even our dog fell in love with it. This will be our baby for a good long time. It is kid friendly, family friendly, and dog family. It's like a part of your family. No wonder why many people own these. A lot of our family members own these, and love them too! We absolutely love it. Simon is the minivan's name, and he is truly loved by his family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The interior and exterior quality are excellent with no problems. It handles well and acceleration is very good; overall, a reliable and comfortable vehicle. But a vibration telegraphs into the engine compartment while gears shift and over the road making for a tiring drive; transmission slips at low speeds. Driveability is on the low end for a new vehicle. (Be careful when test driving and take nothing for granted.) Vehicle is 1 year old with fifteen thousand miles; 14 to 17 mpg around town, broke 30 mpg over the road once, now barely breaks 20. Test drive with care and get one of the good ones. (Will think twice about another Toyota vehicle.) </TEXT>

<TEXT>Acceptable performance at best. Sadly disappointed in several key features. Shifting at low engine speeds frequently causes unacceptable shift quality from 1st to 2nd gear. Intermittent but you see it way too often. Very poor gas mileage. I assume many of those who post good mileage are relying upon their electronic readout in the van. My inaccurate readout tells me I get 26+ MPG highway while the gas pump says 21 MPG at best. Same or worse mileage in town than if I drive our 10 year old beater Plymouth van! The engine change Toyota made in their vans a few years back provides twice the noise of the previous engine. The steering is acceptable at best but the weakest of any brand we drove. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall comfort, and performance. I can only hope Toyota lives up to its reputation for dependability. That was the primary reason for our purchasing this brand. Still within 500 miles it's had two minor electronic issues already.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We are expecting our third child soon and needed a larger vehicle. We chose the Sienna primarily because it is the only van to offer eight useful seats -- the 8th seat offered by the Odyssey is too small to be useful. We also like how the center seat can be moved forward for easy access to our expected baby. Add Toyota's powerful V6 (with a timing chain versus a belt) and better real life gas millage and the Sienna was for us. We have been enjoying our van, including a trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. It was great being able to bring along the kid's bikes by just putting them in the back of the van (no need for a bike rack). The van was a gift for my wife and so far she loves it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We love the front-and-center 8th seat; this is great for an infant car seat. Also love the room, the ride quality and the STAR safety features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently purchased the 2008 Sienna Limited. I traded in my 2001 Honda Odyssey after 2 transmissions! So I wanted to try Toyota and I love it. It is like riding in a luxury car, smooth ride, quiet engine, leather, wood trim, 360 watt stereo and plenty of room. It's new, but I'm only averaging 16 MPG on the highway, so hopefully it will break in and get better. One complaint that I have is when you pay over $33k for a limited you expect a DVD and navigation system, Honda gives you that for the same price as the Toyota! However I drove the new Honda and it was sluggish, and would never trust that brand again. I guess a good engine is better then a good DVD and navigation system!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second XLE and it just keeps getting better! The larger engine and higher HP does make a difference. Even the fuel consumption is better. Rides like a high end large full size car. Handling is very much unlike a mini van. The leather seats in the Honda were plusher looking, but in general the Sienna is a great family car. My daughter has an '06 that she totally loves. Toyota, you did it again. 4 stars.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my 08 LE 8-passenger for 1.5 months now. I'm almost done with the first 1K mile break-in (currently ~ 900 miles) and so far the experience is great. The van drives like a luxurious car, so roomy and comfortable that my toddler keeps asking to get on the van. We got our LE with option 1. We have driven over the mountain (from SJ to Santa Cruz, CA) a few times and the van has enough power to climb up with ease. On the highway, we were surprised that it's so smooth and quiet. Combining hwy and city driving, we have averaged ~ 22 mpg over 900-mile.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have compared all three major vans like odyssey, quest and sienna. No doubt Sienna tops among all three. With 8 passenger is really worth and the same thing in odyssey even kids can't sit it that middle seat (that much small). It's just a week I started driving this but still few negative points like you can't make the 2nd row as bench seat by removing the middle seat and no power option for opening trunk in LE models. If Toyota comes up with more option for LEs then no other minivan can come closer to this including odyssey.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the ride of this product. Upgraded stereo system is outstanding. Very comfortable seating for 7 and plenty of storage behind 3rd seats without folding down. 0% financing was huge. Lots of thought put into functionality like hooks for grocery bags, storage compartments, cup holders, separate climate controls for rear seating. Lots of 110 outlets, sunshades, etc. Only drawback is steering is very soft. When passing I have to remember to give a little extra room because there's a lot of play. Also not XM or Sirius ready. It's capable but you have to purchase a $550 aftermarket kit. Then the antenna wire shows in the back on the outside. Engine loud when passing on highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Went back to a minivan after 2003 Chevy EXT Trailblazer. Was waiting for Traverse but was getting killed on repairs. Wife and mechanic talked me into Sienna and I love it. Saved 10-15K and have more room, storage. Has better acceleration than the SUV with much better mileage. Smooth as silk ride. Still, got Toyota for perceived reliability and was driving on hgwy in first week when plastic trim piece on C pillar came loose and had to pull over in breakdown lane to push back in. So far it has stayed. The only other negative is towing which is non existent since it didn't come with factory.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've had our van for one month and are generally happy with it. It has a lot of space, and provides a quiet comfortable ride for all passengers. It is not a driver's van as the steering feels disconnected and the brakes feel soft. However the engine is a powerful and quiet marvel. On a 2000 mile road trip we found the engine powerfully moves the van along and got nearly 26 mpg running mountainous roads and AC most of the way, even before the engine was fully broken in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With a growing family and need for the convenience and security of AWD/4WD we chose the Toyota Sienna. Just a few years ago I laughed at my friends who had growing families and went out and bought minivans. I take it all back. The Limited AWD Sienna is more like a Lexus that seats 7 comfortably than a minivan. This is a great vehicle and I highly recommend it over the competition based on the AWD option and "more luxurious" interior. If you're spending >$38k it should be nice!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We live deep in the countryside and our routes have harsh paved roads, so we eliminated the Honda Odyssey because of its pronounced road noise. The Sienna absorbs the rough pavement and really does feel like we are driving a Lexus. The ride is luxurious without feeling like we are floating down the road. Gas mileage is 27-28 mpg consistently when driving 55-70 mph. The steering feels precise and it has a tight turning radius. The engine is quiet and has strong acceleration when needed. The interior has versatile configurations, depending on the cargo, whether it is groceries, grand kids, dogs, handicapped relatives, or all of the above! The LE plus some extra options is a great value!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Enjoying this van even more than we expected. Just completed road trip halfway across USA (2700mi round trip) with our infant and preschooler and the van was quieter and more comfortable than many of the hotels we stayed in. Very smooth, versatile, comfortable and dependable, avg'd 25+mpg loaded down with AC full on - even over the mountains & back. Drives great, power is there when needed. Highly recommended for families with small children & all the associated stuff. Smart layout, fold- down front console is simply brilliant. No more diving for the pacifier. Can't say enough about how impressed I am with this van. Feels & drives like a Lexus made for baby seats & strollers. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Feels sturdy and well built in and out. Rear cargo space goes nearly to the ground. Quiet ride. Traction, ABS, full airbag curtains standard even on our base model. Built-in baby mirror.

<TEXT>We just traded our 06 Sienna ltd. for a new 08. Features are identical. Great design, drives like a dream and fuel economy is very reasonable for the size. BUT, Toyota put a new engine in the Sienna in 2007. I guess it does get 1 mpg better and has better horsepower. But, the noise and vibration from the new engine is a major disappointment. The last one had such a smooth power plant; this one is not of the quality of the 2006. If you are in the market, you might be more satisfied withe the previous generation Sienna. We have had the Chryslers and the Honda. Toyota nailed the design and utility of the minivan in the Sienna. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We got ours about 6 weeks ago, and are very pleased. We replaced a 2001 Mazda MPV, which I thought was a "perfect" size. I was a little worried the Sienna was going to be too big, but it's really nice having the extra space, and it still fits in our garage (just barely). It's very smooth, quiet, and powerful, and even the CE version that they make for cheapskates like me had all the features we wanted. The sliding doors operate easily, and the "tumble forward" middle row seats give easy access to the 3rd row.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was in the market for a crossover, but found all of them to be too small for the kids and grandkids so we opted for the best minivan on the planet. I have back problems and the cloth seats on the LE are very comfortable. Much better than the leather. Mileage is about as promised. Power is very responsive. I would not go so far as to say it is fun to drive, but the safety systems put my mind at ease. We have two couples that we travel with and they love the room in the second and third seats. Enough cup holders for two armies. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Avoid all wheel drive; here's why; the run flat tires. These tires will only last you about 10-20k miles. They are very costly (2 replaced last week cost me 600). They also are not easily replaced by tire dealerships. So, let's say you are on a vacation, the light comes on, you have 50 miles to drive before the tire shreds, and no available place to fix the tire within 100 miles. Get the picture? The AWD additional mechanisms take up the room in which the spare tire would be located, so run flats were the solution. This van also averages only 17 miles per gallon. In summary, well built, poor gas mileage, and costly, hard to replace, and quick to wear out, tires, even with 3k rotations.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd sienna. Replacing the 70k miles 04 in december. The new V6 is more powerful yet does not consume much more gas than 04 (20 vs 21.3). The navi is improved over the 04. The ride is just smooth. We also have a 07 odyssey, which ride much rougher and gets a lot worse gas mileage. Sienna handling is loose and brake are soft. However, the interior design is much better than Odyssey. We like the captain seat on the Sienna over the captains on the Odyssey. However, I really wished that Sienna offers 8 pax model for limited. One thing we also liked was that Sienna is a lot more roomier than Odyssey especially the 3rd row. Overal Sienna is just a superior van. Also love HID.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine and transmission works well togther. Backup camera is much higher quality than Honda's. Placement of door switch on the overhead console as well as b-pillar. Bluetooth. Seats are comfortable. Smooth ride and better body motion control over rought roads. Quiet. HID.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Cannot believe minivan rides could be this comfortable. When we started to look for minivans we checked out Honda Odyssey and Nissan Quest. Very soon we decided it's going to be either Sienna or Odyssey. Quest was out of choice. Sienna's comfort and ride satisfaction was way higher than Odyssey and we instantly liked it. Sienna seems to use Electronic Brake Distribution, which makes the brakes feel lighter but efficient. Very minimal steering action is required for turns. All you need is a pinky finger to drive this excellent minivan. Arctic Frost Pearl color looks great even at the nighttime! </TEXT>

The Sienna has the best ride of all three and handles well. The engine just blows the others away. I wasn't looking for power to win stoplight races but I got it, but I wanted the power for passing or emergency maneuvers requiring power. The quality of the Toyota was the best. I average 21.3 mpg in my Sienna. Toyota Sienna is the best van on the market. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Sienna or Odyssey? It's like 6 of one, half a dozen of the other. The two are both excellent, safe minivans, and if you have to have a minivan, either one will serve you well. I traded in a 2002 Chrysler Town & Country for the '08 Sienna because it felt more refined, and was more attractive inside and out than the Odyssey. The Odyssey has a tighter wheel and firmer ride--some call it more sporty. The Sienna's steering is looser, so you may not feel as if you have as much control, but you do. The Sienna's ride is incredibly smooth, and the turning radius is tight (for a minivan). There is hardly any road noise, and in my Limited there are more features than I know what to do with.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We chose the Sienna over the Honda on price. We could get most the options on the Sienna that we wanted. It seemed with the Honda that it was all or nothing and not too many options. We like the people/cargo volume you get for the price. The van has a surprisingly tight turning radius, good for parking. I wish the power tailgate was an optional item. I would rather have that powered than the 2 side doors. The interior is pretty cheap looking and basically not pretty inside. The ergonomics of the stereo stink! The engine is kind of rough sounding at times if you listen for it and the transmission can be a little jerky in certain situations. The ride could better. Overall we're happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a gas hog, this van's great, loaded all the grand kids and went christmas light looking. Ride is smooth, handles great. Middle seats are tough to get out and put back in. Lots of room.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 8 Passenger sold my wife It can haul all of our grand kids and the mid seat that positions foreward is great for the 14 mo old to be accessed while driving and hold car seat. It has been getting over 24 mpg on the road. Fits in the garage better also. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The little mid seat for Mallory. Gas mileage is good for van. The other four kids like the electric back doors.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Great van - Bad Nav</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>This is a great van! The quality is great...Toyota. The layout is comfortable. The only negative about the van is the GPS navigation system. Many secondary roads are not on the map. You cannot use the controls while the vehicle is moving. Toyota says it is because of safety, however if you have a passenger along, you can't find a hotel or a place to eat. A real pain. Don't get the GPS, buy an after market model that works on the move. The Toyota GPS is not user friendly and has a poor map (that you pay a fee to update). I have a hand held Garmin that is far superior. Again, great van that I really love just don't waste your money on the poor navigation system.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall pretty satisfied. Plenty of power. Very tight turning radius makes it easy to park. JBL surround sound system works great with DVD player. Wireless head phones sound good and are comfortable. Mileage around town only 16-17 but engine not yet broken in. Hopefully will improve. Ride is comfortable and quite but a bit on the "soft" side, would prefer tighter more responsive suspension. Power sliding doors have to be turned either on or off, and if on, manual operation is not possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased this VAN (its no mini) to upgrade from my '04 Corolla (loved it) as expecting family to grow soon. It is huge!! Very comfy for passengers, but very vague for the driver! Rolls during cornering with soft tuned suspension and soft brakes. Interior is very quiet. Great for cargo haul - has shopping hooks for grocery. Folding console in first row gives driver mobility inside the van. Gas mileage is 20-22 in town; Toyota's great build quality, but wish was slightly smaller and more engaging. Need to adjust to its gas guzzling habit during pick up. Toyota give a Hybrid option to help its pickup without compromising mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Low noise & build quality, fold 2/3 row seats, radio with 6 CD changer, mp3 aux plug, overhead display w/homelink & compass (many mileage related stats), in-wheel radio controls.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great van with lots of power. Other minivans that I've driven (Dodge, Kia) struggled going up hills or at high speeds. The Sienna handles beautifully. The power doors are a very inexpensive option on the LE and are great. If you are looking for an 8 passenger minivan, Sienna is the best option. Most other minivans don't offer 8 seats. The Honda Odyssey does, but it has a very weird half-size 8th seat. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All around solid design.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Sienna (the first was a 2004 and was great). We bought this with the package #4 (rear DVD, navigation, leather) and like the comfort a lot. What is clear at this point though is that our $799 Garmin 760 add-on for our other car is MUCH better for navigation. On a recent trip from between New England and DC, the Toyota system kept trying to take us off the obvious main interstates onto other interstates and side highways and some local roads - even with interstates allowed in the options - it did this again and again and has left us VERY disappointed in what is supposed to be a high end feature. The van itself is wonderful - best for comfort / quiet / ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the design - I think it's the prettiest minivan going. It's so quite (which is great with kids), handles well, very smooth - all good features for a van that's going to haul you and yours on family trips everywhere.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased this to replace a 10 year old Windstar. This was a HUGE improvement! Standard things are upgrades for us. The little things make this a special vehicle, like the grocery bag hooks, the fold away back seats, and the speed sensitive radio with 6 disc CD changer. No major road trips, yet, but looking forward to one soon. This van handles like a car, but has all the comforts of a van. Cornering is unreal. Gas mileage is in the 22 range around town. An average adult is comfortable in any of the seats, too. My only wish is for a DC outlet, or at least an AC outlet in the middle seat area, and the motor is a little noisy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fold flat rear seats, everything about the radio (CD changer, mp3/wma compatability, speed sensitive volume, aux input), dashboard display, fold down center console.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It has all the features you could want. I love the power of this 3.5L V6, I catch myself speeding a lot, and racing people from stoplights and actually winning in the mommy mobile. It gets decent gas mileage about 21 mpg around town. The JBL sound system is very nice and so is the DVD system. The seats are very comfy and the ride is smooth and quiet. you cannot go wrong with this van.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Toyota Sienna XLE model. I am now on my 4th one. I just purchased the 2008 model with sonar, moonroof, heated seats, Bluetooth. It is awesome. When I was ready to purchase a new car I drove several, determined that my next car would not be a mini-van. However, already being a Sienna owner ('04 model) nothing else I drove compared with the roomy interior, comfortable seats, high end dash and control panel, and options. I have plenty of room to carry kids as well as adults. The third row of seats can easily handle 3 adults. Many of the crossovers have 3rd row seats that are too difficult to get into or not comfortable for adults. Also, I drove the buick enclave and loved it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Sienna, along with Odyssey, is the top pick in this segment. As such, there is very little to complain about. The only thing dislike is the run flats that are standard on AWD models. The rigid side walls transmit every little bumps on the road. If you want a cushy ride then do NOT get AWD models. Every things else is just great. Functionality is well thought out and suited for family life. Many cup holders , bag hooks, and other minor details add up to a very usable car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Strong V6 engine (it's faster than my expectation of a minivan), roomy interior (I'm a big guy and I can lay down comfortably in the back, when I go camp), and build quality.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my 08 XLE for almost a month, it has been awesome. The engine is very strong and i have no problems passing cars on the freeway. I average about 21 mpg around town and on the open road i have gotten up to 28 mpg cruising at 70 mph. The seats are very comfortable and the ride is smooth like a Lexus and quiet too. The JBL sound system is awesome and the navigation system is very easy to use and has bluetooth and satellite radio. The build quality is top notch and resale value is the best.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my 08 LE for 2 weeks and it has been great. It has a lot of power, I think it can hit 0-60 in 7 seconds. The fuel economy is great, I average 20 mpg city and up to 28 mpg highway. The seats are very comfy, the dvd screen is clear and the JBL sound system rocks! I recommend it to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2nd Toyota I own, first one is a Corolla LE 1990,102k miles. Toyota is an almost perfect builder. Never experienced such comfort and workmanship in a van (had a 200 Windstar Limited). All the controls make sense. I have the van for a short time but very pleased. So far this van exceeds my expectations in fit finish and quality overall.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The electronic dash is the best I have seen besides the Lexus.</FAVORITE>
