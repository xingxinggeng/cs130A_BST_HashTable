<TEXT>It's been a year now and I still love this car. I did have a problem with the top locking up. Now there is a recall for that part(s). I'm over 6 feet but I sit comfortably in this convertible. Kicking myself for not purchasing the Audi Care Service for $740 in IL. Maybe they will let me buy it before the 15k service? Love the paddle shifters. Hate the Ipod interface. I have to guess at the playlist, album, artists. My wife used regular unleaded against my wishes and it has not affected my 28mpg! Where can I get some track time and properly learn how to push this car to its limits.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great fuel economy. 28 mpg on regular or premium! Drive it year round on all-season tires. Better than rear-axle Porsche. Comfortable for us tall guys. Synthetic suede is nice and not as hot as leather in the summer and not as cold in the winter. Seats heat quickly. Brakes are good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My previous cars were a 2005 Lotus Elise and a 2000 Boxster S before that. I need a 4 seater for my baby son and the TT was the only car that really interested me short of a 911. Comparatively, the TT is very capable in the real world. Its handling is decent, however the steering a bit light and there's too much understeer in the canyons. Acceleration is decent and brake is excellent. Storage is adequate. It's a good daily driver car. I did compare payment to a similar spec VW GTi (no interest in it but just doing due diligence) and the TT is about $125 more a month so it's not a bad deal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Adaptive headlights, magnetic ride, and DSG. Exterior & interior styling and attention to details are good too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got this 3.2 coupe used and am loving it! Handles like a dream and the dual clutch tranny is by far the best feature. Would buy a 4 cylinder if buying new, but wanted to Quattro and saved. 08 3.2 was my only option for Quattro given used and value. As for gas mileage, averaging about 22 and am happy with it. It hard to compare the gas mileage in my mind when this thing wants to run well above the speed limit. If you want to push it off the line every time then the numbers will drop, and yes, so will they in any car. I'm very impressed with the style throughout, and cannot get over the attention to detail in the beauty. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Magnetic suspension, dual clutch, fit and finish. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been driving my 1995 Audi 90 for over 13 years when I upgraded to a slightly used 2008 Audi TT. Wow, what a difference a decade makes. I am amazed at the power of the 2.0T, along with the smoothnessof the whole vehicle. I've owned Audi's for over 25 years, so I am a fan - but of course there are some things that could be improved.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage, power, handling, seats all come to mind but it does have some usable new electronic features that make it an Audi.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Three years ago, after having three TTs, I traded the last one for an A3. But when the redesigned TT model came out, I couldn't resist. The 2008 coupe (3.2 quattro with S-tronic) is a step above the previous models in every respect: power, handling, styling, sophistication, fun. I especially like the smoothness of the S-tronic, which hesitated quite a bit in the last two cars I had. The larger interior is just enough to make friends say it no longer feels cramped. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Design, interior, engine, quattro, S-tronic, automatic spoiler. It hugs the road and corners like a panther. Engine growl is perfect.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a nice little car. Convenient as the size allows easy parking everywhere. Gas mileage is acceptable, not as good as the 2.0 version. Interior is outstanding (enhanced leather interior), the rear seats work well with my 2 children (ages 9 and 6) for short rides. The suspension feels a little harsh (I don't have magnetic suspension), which might be a deal breaker for some. However, no car is perfect and this one is not the exception. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This thing sticks to the pavement like a bubblegum. What is dangerous is that one is tempted to challenge the car, but so far TT is winning all challenges I've made! Ipod interface is great (wish it could recognize the tracks). Love the steering. And of course, the looks!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What can I say. It's summer time and I like to drive with my top off. I still need to get used to it since I only drove it for a week. It's a head turner for sure. I couldn't do that with my old car, so I am pretty happy with it. I have yet to test the S drive and the S tronic though, but the D drive has been exciting so far </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The new slick headlights.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this for my wife, she needed one last sports car before we she got "old". She had an old 1976 Porsche 911 but loves this car better, in fact she's says the TT is her best car ever. Bought a red color coupe and she loves it. It's perfect for her petite size and I know she loves getting all the attention. The handling is great, it wants to be driven and before she knows it the spolier pops up and she notices that she's going 80 miles plus. The trunk is big enough for a weekend trip. I'm just a bit too big for the seat which is too confining for me on a long drive but it's a her car and she loves it.. When Mama's happy everybody's happy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Striking design gets a lot of attention, the beautiful red color helps that factor. The mileage that we've gotten is very good. Fun to drive fast.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is amazing! Style, performance, and quality are all 10. The 4cyl turbo is great, plenty of kick to it. Peformance and economy, my last fill up was averaged at 30mpg. I was hesitant to purchase an automatic, what's the fun of a sports car that you can't shift? However, the paddle shifters are a lot of fun, and make up for a spouse that can't drive stick. The top drops smooth and speedy. Nice to be able to put it up or down when moving. The launch control feature is a blast! It will light the tires up like it had 400 horses under the hood. Great in the snow as FWD only. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Paddle shifters, Bose sound system, speed of top</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love to drive this car. I had a car that got better gas mileage, and just couldn't give up driving this fun sports car. Too early really to tell about reliability. With numerous frost heave "speedbumps" and potholes around here, I started hearing a knocking noise in the front end when going over a bump. The dealership however didn't hear it. Of course, I'm still under warranty. They also told me that the 2 bent rims are "slight" although I have a tire/rim warranty. The rear tires are worn out at around 17,000 miles. They stick like glue to the road however. Would I buy this car again? You bet!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love to see that spoiler pop up. I love the radio and the sound of the engine. It's a car that invites admiration wherever you go. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>I won it!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I won a 08 TT coupe in Bixoli, MS at the Grand Casino and traded it for a Roadster with 47 miles on it at the dealer. I have had 6 convertibles before this and never an Audi (3 MGs, 1 Mustang, 1 LeSabre, 1 Miata). This baby takes the cake, it is smooth and agressive at the same time. I just love this car. It is a real eye turner also. Drives well in the city and runs like a scalded dog when you put your foot into it on the interstate. I love when the automatic spooler goes up at 75mph (you can manually do it also in town ) and people point at you with amazement as you pass.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Curb appeal and warranty. The Roadster has a huge truck. I was impressed when I looked in it. It also has several nooks and cranny storage compartments around the car. It also come with a bag to tranport your skis inside the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Really wonderful except the gas mileage. After having owned three 225hp TT Roadster before I have to admit I really like the sound of the engine. Compared to the 225hp experiences before however this 6cyl consumes considerably more fuel (hwy 25 vs hwy 29). Obviously the first TT almost made me a die-hard TT fan, but there have been considerable improvements to the new generation, such as a larger trunk (no lie: it can manage two gold bags), a better top, great GPS and customizable computer. Needless to say that I just love the design. All wheel makes it a safer ride even under challenging circumstances.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love and never want to miss again the 2-SD slots (that come with the optional GPS). Handling and power, design, body integrity are upper class.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is simply a blast to drive. I have the basic 4cyl turbo model and it flies. Car is built to be driven hard. I have a stop and go and highway commute and its is happy doing both. It is tight and responsive and loves to be pushed. Driving this car will actually make you smile every single time you get in. You will find yourself looking for reasons to go for a drive. Everyone will look at you in this car simply b/c there are so few out there on the road. Truly a fun car to own and pleasure to drive</TEXT>

<TEXT>My second Audi TT is red. It is a great looking car. The top has broken and gets stuck down. This has happened twice in one month. It was fixed and only lasted a few weeks. Also the passenger window doesn't lay flush with the door after several repair attempts. It looks better with the window not sticking up a little. I could use some help with this. Obviously I loved the TT enough to lease another one. I was hoping it would work well like the 2004 TT I leased for 4 happy years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I first saw the Audi TT on the road and immediately started to do my research. After attending the Chicago auto show, I was sold on the TT and had to have one I now own a 3.2L 6 speed manual and can desribe this vehicle in one word: powerful. Driving this car is truly an experience and we cannot wait to take it for a long drive. The car handles so well that I can drive 90 mph and not feel any vibration. If you are thinking of buying this vehicle, stop thinking and buy. You will love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like my audio symphony system, which allows me to listen to my iPOD, Sirius, CDs, commercial radio, or use the Bluetooth. The styling is very pleasing to the eye and I can understand the concept of fit and finish after driving this vehicle. Finally, the engine sounds and feels powerful!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My new Audi replaces a 2002 TT 225 Quattro 6 speed manual. I almost expect to have minor electrical and mechanical issues, but it's a compromise when driving this great road going car. The new TT has only a few hundred miles, but it is easy to see and feel the differences. It is a better appointed interior, and the DSG has become very smooth in its delivery. The gusty exhaust note is what I listen to most when I drive, though the basic factory stereo sounds great. Bought the car for Quattro and when I had a FWD A3 for loaner, it was apparent I made the right decision. I'll check back after I get through the self imposed 5k mile "keep the RPM under 3500) break-in period. Easier said than done</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Instant power and Quattro's ability to put traction down and keep you going in the direction you point the steering wheel. Retractable rear spoiler allows the cars clean lines to show through. S-Tronic transmission is perfect for the highway, back roads and in the city too. Aluminum hood easy lift.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had my TT for 1 week and loving it! Fully loaded excl. nav and mag. ride. Was considering an '04/'05 but then saw the '08 and it was all over. I test drove the 2.0 but decided on the 3.2 due to power and Quattro - I expect to keep this car for a long time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth, performance, paddles and the awesome engine sound. Great cockpit and feels great to drive - gets a lot of looks even when it's parked.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this car for 8 months and I still get all giddy when I see it. I feel that the seats fit my body so well that when I sit down in them, my happy tt is giving me a hug. Its fast, its sexy and handles well. I have never felt that the car has put me in danger and I love how noisy the exhaust is (but its not an annoying noise like from some modified cars). I feel bad for people who have chosen to buy other cars in its class.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seat warmers are amazing! I love to turn them on after a hard dance or boxing session since it keeps my muscles from getting sore. I also love that it does not hold many people so I am not stuck driving people around. The trunk has A LOT of room when back seats are folded.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had some problems with my AUTOMATIC transmission. When I am stopped on a hill and then try to go, the car rolls backward like I have a manual transmission. There does not seem to be a hill-holder feature. What is maddening, is that this only happens occasionally. I must put my foot on the brake AND gas to keep from hitting the car behind me. When I reported the problem to the dealership, they said it was a normal characteristic of the car. Also, the car rolls backward an inch, or so, when I put it in park on a hill. The transmission seems loose, or sloppy. My dealership can find nothing wrong. I can't believe this is a NORMAL characteristic of the car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great styling. Love the sport-shift mode. Power is excellent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am a previous 2003 TT roadster owner and I was very happy with this car. However, the improvements of the 2008 made it a car I had to have. I was reluctant to give up my turbo to the v6 but I have to say I have not missed it much. This car still has quick pickup and speed whenever I need it. I love the optional navigation, ipod interface, and bluetooth. I also love the manageability of the cars computer view on the console. I shopped for many months before purchasing a new car and it came down to the Z06 and the TT. Yeah, some V8 corvette lover is laughing at me right now but bang for the buck I got the better car. I have been an owner of both cars and in the end best car won.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The new convertible automatic top, much improved from the unfinished single layered manual convertible top of the previous models. I also love the fact the car has two SD memory slots. I load my mp3s on the memory and use it in my car way better than CDs, IPOD, or Sat. radio.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first Audi. I love it. The styling blows me away everytime I go to drive. I can't believe that the best car in any parking lot is my mine. Loads of room in the front and the trunk. The rear seats are good for shopping or our medium sized dog. Even if I'm stuck in traffic I can enjoy the elegance of this car, until, that is, there is an opportunity to use all the power - exhilarating! 2 (optional) suspension modes (sport/regular) and 4 transmission choices (auto, sport, paddle override and clutchless manual - great combinations. The quattro AWD drive is superb in the snow. I am hoping reliability is good but I've only had it 3 months. As an only car, for a kid free couple it's fantastic</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had the car for less than a month but love it. I traded an 03 Audi TT which I thought was a great car but it pales in comparison to the new one. Extremely fun to drive but be careful, I just got my first speeding ticket in 10 years with it. Very tight, responsive, and roomy for a 2 seater. Bluetooth has not worked properly since I bought it and am taking it back to service (again) next week. The bluetooth receives very clearly but transmission is broken up to the point the other person can barely understand what I am saying.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wait -- let me wipe the silly grin off my face. How much fun can you have in a car? Design, build, performance are all first rate. First Audi I have owned and I am impressed. It's quick, nimble, but comfortable and accomodating. The interior looks and feels so much better than the Mercedes and BMW we test drove (forego the standard Alcantara upholstery - the Napa leather upgrades are worth the extra money). It turns heads wherever it goes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ultra-sensual looks with the top down. Brilliant engine/transmission combo (2.0T with DSG). Interior design and build that other luxury manufacturers should emulate. Fairly quiet ride for a ragtop with taut suspension.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just got the 08 TT roadster convertible Sahara Silver with Baseball Glove leather interior, and mag ride. I am amazed at how fun the car is to drive, being my first convertible, first german car ever, and with cornering/acceleration that is way fun. I cannot imagine springing for the 3.2 when my turbo 4 cyl is as much fun as I'd want to have. I'm not dragging it at the track or anything. The clincher is that the color and style is out of this world beautiful. I believe it's an instant classic. I'm hoping it's sufficiently reliable, though as a 4th car (parked except for weekends and special occasions), I'm willing to tolerate some compromises and shop time for its charms.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty dials at night, with write and red lighting. Incredibly quiet for a soft top convertible. Shifting (using manumatic) is incredible.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Took delivery in late July after ordering the 1st of May. Could not be happier. My last convertible was 17 years ago, a Silver Buick Reatta. Reatta needed more power and was much heavier than the TT and had vague steering compared to razor sharp feel now. I flashed the chip with APR software and the car moves very responsively and smoothly. Also replaced the fogs with PIAA HIDs and put in bright amber DRLs. I plan to install an air intake system and rework the exhaust in the near future. The car will be a project, with mods installed as they come to market. I may even put in a higher- performance turbo in the future, with nitrous being considered. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DSG is a blast with more shift modes than I ever had b4, RPM blip up is great. Sirius satellite with 6-CD changer and Bose system has really nice sound and features. 18-inch wheels and fat Pirelli tires perform nicely. Baseball stitch seats are very comfy and get a lot of attention. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first European car, and so far it has exceeded my high expectations. The styling is beautiful, the ride is comfortable and solid, it's very zippy, very nimble, steering is very comfortable, fuel economy is great even if you like to accelerate quickly. The interior is composed of high quality materials and a soothing variety of textures and finishes. The controls are all at your fingertips and easy to operate. It also has very decent cargo capacity that is actually accessible. I could go on, but suffice it to say it's a truly exceptional experience to drive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had the car for 2 days but I am in love! After test driving several the Infiniti G35X, Acura TL Type S, BMW 328xi I was set to buy the TL-S when I stopped by my Audi dealer. When I saw the new 2008 TT coupe, I stopped dead in my tracks - I don't think there is a better looking car on the road. I drove both the 3.2 Quattro and 2.0T and while the former has a little extra punch and impeccable handling, the 2.0T was plenty strong and nimble. And it fit my wallet better. I have a hard time finding any faults with the TT, but even a harder time wiping the smile off my face when driving it. I truly think this car is a good value compared to the competition.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks the car gets as it smoothly zips through 75 MPH and the rear spoiler raises; the feel of being securely hugged by the top-notch leather bucket seats; the precision of the racing steering wheel; the top quality interior; the ultra fast gear shifting and lack of turbo lag.</FAVORITE>
