<TEXT>We had a 2001 Chevy Tahoe that we liked very much. When it was time to trade we checked out the Chevy Tahoe Hybrid. We really love the truck, we call it the magic carpet ride because it rides so smooth. Wind noise is minimal and the power is great for a full size SUV. Recently we took it on a trip pulling our 6,000lb boat and trailer, I hardly knew the trailer was on the back of the vehicle. After 180 miles one way, we arrived as if we had been riding without the trailer. I own a 2003 Dodge 2500 with Hemi engine, that truck beats us to death and it does not pull the trailer with the ease of this vehicle. We also got between 12.5 and 14.3 MPG, the truck would get 9.5 MPG.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather seats are very comfortable and the rear camera makes trailer hookup a breeze when you have to do it alone. Love the increased gas mileage, we get 20 to 21 most of the time, we have seen 22 to 23 if we drive around 65 on the interstate, that's hard to do with the smooth ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've gotta say for the fuel efficiency, hands down, the best. Traded my old Range Rover for it & I'm super happy about my gas mileage but it is BIG. Bigger than any other vehicle I've had. The rear camera needs improvement (the angle and range are off). The rear sensors are not as sensitive as they should be (minor fender bender backed into a small car) But I get 30+ on the highway easy. Trust me, I'm always checking. They were very modest with the mpg. So whenever I'm in Atl or DC traffic, I'm laughing at the suckers who are burning up their money lol. Took the 3rd row seats out, there's no room for storage with them in. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had 2 other gas Tahoe's since 2004 and the #1 question I get when someone notices I have a Hybrid is "does it have any power?", and the second of course is "what kind of gas mileage do you really get". I'm always very proud to say it's more powerful than either of my 2 previous gas Tahoe's and I get 19-21 in town, and about the same on longer trips. I had the dealership remove all the decals on body, and removed the windshield decals myself with a hair dryer & WD40 (it really works!). The only thing I miss is my power tailgate. This Hybrid is Mybrid and if you want one, get your own! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a BMW 745i for this vehicle for the space and 3rd row of seats. I was so happy at first, until things started breaking. First, every time i filled the gas tank up, the truck missed and wouldnt run. Something was wrong with the gas tank which allowed it to fill up too much. Second, a sensor went out causing me to almost not stop in a parking lot. Then, the hybrid system in the transmission went out. Now, my driver side rear door won't open and im taking it in tomorrow. Finally, I only average 16mpg city. This is nowhere near the 21 advertised on the sticker when I bought it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely love this car. I have only had it for a couple of weeks, and I like driving it more and more everyday. I had my eye on an 07 Tahoe when I purchased this one and I am so glad I did. Not to mention the black is fabulous! I have seen the ones with the hybrid decals, but mine did not come with those and I am glad. The gas mileage has proved better than the minivan we previously owned. I would recommend this care to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have enjoyed this vehicle very much, especially during the summer of '08 when gas hit $4.00 a gallon. It rides very well, has lots of room and is quiet after 45,000 miles. I have had it in for extra service 3 times due to the hybrid transmission failing - first the modulator, then the transmission itself, then the modulator again. Fortunately the failures occurred close to home and the dealer was terrific in getting it repaired quickly. I am willing to put up with the hassle to get the excellent mileage for a full sized SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded an 07 Tahoe LTZ on this hybrid. It's great sitting at a stand- still and still having cold A/C while burning no fuel. The 4WD works great. I miss the rain sense wipers, memory seats, and power tailgate, but I love getting 4-5mpg more than on the all gas Tahoe. Especially since this one has more power than the engine on a regular Tahoe. I've saved some 25% on my gas useage, and since it was >$4.00/gal last summer and fall that adds up to a lot of money. The ride is great and it pulls my trailer effortlessly. I bought as soon as it was available so I did have a recall to replace something in the hybrid system, but they put me in a Caddy while it was in the shop, so OK.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cold A/C while in hybrid mode. 2-mode hybrid system that helps even when in 4WD, and the gas engine is running. More power than standard Tahoe.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am truly enjoying my Tahoe. It rides nicely, and brakes very well. The technology is great, and the OnStar directions service is amazing. I just got a cable for my iphone, and it connects perfectly with the stereo system, and allows great connectivity to my phone. I also love the interior. The year end deal was fabulous with lots of incentives. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2007 gas Tahoe for the 2008 hybrid. The mileage is everything that they say it is. It has changed my driving habits somewhat, I'm not a agressive and heavy footed at I used to be. Average 21.3 MPG overall, city mostly, little highway. On my gas Tahoe, I'd get 325 miles per tank if I was lucky, on the hybrid I can get 500 miles per fill-up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My hybrid stinks - Gas mileage is 16 MPG - Intermittent noise under hood that GM says cannot be fixed - been in shop over 45 days now. GM District Service Manager basically called me a liar & told me the cars simply not broke in yet & I'm buying cheap gas at Shell. GM refuses to repurchase the vehicle & refuses to fix the problem because the noise is intermittent. Factory couldn't even test Hybrid Component to see if that's the problem! After being bullied by GM probably won't buy another GM vehicle! New technology not always great!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>On black vehicle - I like the Hybrid stickers - there sharp & advertises the "Green" decision I make as a consumer</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The incorporation of a CVT on a full size SUV really makes the difference here. Not only does this feature always keep the vehicle in the perfect RPM range, it is super smooth. I just wish the interior was a bit more modern. My reliability rating is a wash as I have only had the vehicle for a few weeks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was in the market for a large SUV. So why not decrease my carbon exposure and increase some fuel saving. I avg. 21.3 city driving and almost 24 highway. The hybrid technology has changed the way I drive in that I am not as aggressive a driver as I once was; saving much more on fuel economy. I totally recommend hybrids. Great purchase even though people think a large SUV Hybrid is an oxymoron.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For a vehicle this size it is relatively quick and a fun ride. Handling is good, and most importantly, the mileage thus-far is performing up to stated claims. You can tell it is a hybrid as you drive it at lower speeds since it feels like you're driving an electric golf cart. Sometimes, there is hesitation from a dead stop as it decides whether to use electric, gas, or a combo of the two to get the truck moving. A minor quibble. Interior controls are intuitive and easy to figure out. It lacks some bells and whistles that vehicles of this price tend to have, however, such a programmed seating, heated outside mirrors, and 6-disc CD player. All in all, I love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mileage that meets/exceeds stated claims. Smooth ride, even over rougher surfaces. Good acceleration and torque at passing speeds. Comfortable interior seats. Attractive exterior design.</FAVORITE>
