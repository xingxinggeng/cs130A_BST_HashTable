<TEXT>I've had my Sentra for 18 mos. and have come to the conclusion that it is just "OK". I have 25,000 miles on it and it has been reliable-no mechanical problems. That said, having been a Honda owner previously (Civics and Accords), I wish now that I had stuck with Honda for two reasons: comfort and fuel economy. I drive 120 miles daily on straight, flat, highways and the best I have ever gotten was 32 MPG. I did better than that with my Accord which was bigger and more powerful, and far better than that with my Civic. Regarding comfort, the absence of telescopic steering means having to drive with outstretched arms, which is uncomfortable and annoying. Also, road noise is a bit loud.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ok, so I've had my sentra for almost a year now. This car does well as far as gas mileage since I drive 50+ miles one way commuting back and forth to work. All and all it's a great car with great gas mileage, only thing is the steering wheel is rather hard to steer, and limits your movement as far as hand placement. For a tall and thin sedan this car seems very grounded and handles curves alright.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Radio & good gas mileage..and the keyless entry I had installed...part of deal for car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>i recently purchased this car used with nissans certified pre-owned program. That being said I cannot find anything inherently wrong with the car design without nitpicking. Yes the CVT transmission takes some getting used to and the stability when driving "spirited" leaves me wanting more. It is to say that this is a commuter vehicle and as such performs its daily tasks appropriatly to its design. No it is not a speed racer and its not ment to be. Seeing that the speed limit in my state is still 70 mph the sentra seems to work well at this speed for long distances. as for anyone complaining about the whirring noise from the transmission at speed needs to just turn some music on.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>probably the bluetooth handsfree altho there are many other cars out there that offer it. The CVT tranny once you get used to its uniqueness.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car gets great gas mileage and the exterior of the car is very Nice. But, it is the most uncomfortable car that I have ever had to drive. The steering wheel is extremely uncomfortable, I feel like I can never adjust my hands and elbows to a comfortable position while driving it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning only American cars I love my Nissan Sentra, my wife owns an 06 Altima. We have 5 kids, 3 at home, and this car is quick (CVT), great gas mileage, 29 city and 34 Hwy. I am 6?2 and find it very comfortable with space left in the back for an adult with extra head room. I think it is very quiet and runs on the highway very smoothly for a small car. Now is it like my pervious Lincoln Towncar, no way. But is far better than any other ?midsize? car I have owned. The only complaint is winter time in Iowa, being small it can be a challenge to drive in very heavy snow. I love this car and it is all I need.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a mid-to-later aged guy who is basically lazy and let me tell you that this car with the telephone modem and keyless entry is a dream! Except for the fact that it's a bit tall and thin so it doesn't have the stability of, say, my honda civic, it is a really a great car and has a lot of room inside and in the hide away trunk. I only get about 26mpg but I'm a heavy-footer. I've broken the darn drivers mirror off twice in my tight garage so I think they need to be "foldable". The mpg avg on the dash is a joke but the radio is great. I have noticed that the tire pressure is a major issue and between the low pressure alarm as well as veering to one side or the other.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the third Nissan we have owned. My wife loves them. She opted for the 6 speed which is smooth and fun to drive. We have 11k miles on the car and so far so good except for one squeak in the back no one can find. The fuel mileage is great at 36 mpg Hwy. The biggest improvement would be a little more leg room for the knees the shifter console is rough on them after a few miles. Overall very satisfied and will keep for about 6 years. Thanks Nissan and keep up the Good work!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Sentra for over a year now. The new Sentra design is much better than the previous models. This is really a French Car with Renault roots. Built for ride quality, comfort and quiet traveling. Also inside it is as big as a mid size car although the outside looks very compact. I enjoyed several trips in this car and I do not miss having a bigger mid size car at all. CVT tranny takes a little getting use to and car will drift a little on very windy days due to the height of the car. Everyone interested in a compact car should drive a Sentra for sure!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got the SL fully loaded and for the most part the car is great. The build quality seems to be pretty decent, although the sunglasses holder is definitely flimsy. I like the sound system, sunroof, Intelligent key, and trip computer. On the highway, I do get about 32-33 MPG, but in the city, I get terrible mileage. I do drive probably 3 miles at a time sometimes, so that was to be expected. My only complaint was that the brake light has come on twice thus far (I'm only about 5500 miles in), both times for reasons beyond anyone's comprehension. Nissan's warranty covered everything, but it was troubling nevertheless. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my full size 08 Titan 4x4 in on this car because I refused to pay $100 for a tank of gas. Very, very painful decision. But in the end, it was the right decision. I looked at all the economy cars and happily decided on the Sentra. I haven't had any problems with my Nissans. This car has nice room for its size (I'm 6-4 and 36" inseam), pretty good quality manufacture, good power, 31-33 mpg, and handling is good except I get blown around pretty good in high winds and behind semi-trucks. I got a great deal on this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The keyless system is cool. Can't believe I didn't have bluetooth before. I like the split trunk and fold down rear seat. All cars should have the mp3 plug-in socket. All the airbags. This car just looks good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We really wanted to get the Yaris (sedan) but they were on back order. After test driving the 08'Yaris (hatchback)& 09'Corolla. We weren't impressed at all. So, we headed to Nissan. We test drove the Versa (sedan) and I have to say that even that car drove better than the Toyota's. Then we drove the Sentra. WOW! It is quite and we were very impressed, that we purchased it on the spot. And we had no intentions of buying a car that day. Its a fun and awesome car. Infact, the back seat is roomier than my hubby's 03'Galant. It fits 2 adults & 2 kids comfortably. This is just a 3rd car for us, but I have a hard time giving it up so my hubby can have his turn. The CVT is awesome too! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Went around looking at every car in the mid size range that you can think of, I tried so hard to avoid the Sentra. Look at everything Corolla, Jetta, Hyundai Accent etc but they just seemed dull. Then my parents talked me into it taking a look at Nissan. I couldn't believe i had avoided it for so long. I had to opt for the S because let's just face it, the base was bland. So far getting great mileage, if you are considering the Sentra go for the S and add the convenience plus package for a few dollars more. You wont regret it</TEXT>

The car took a beating and rolled three times from the force of the impact the car landed on it's passenger side and I was held suspended in the driver side by my safety belt.

<TEXT>Right off the bat I noticed that The motor is very quiet and has great acceleration. The power you get with 33 MPG you can't really go wrong. The steering and handling has great response. All the controllers, knobs, switches, and whistles are very easy to use, they are easy to get to, and are easy to remember where they are located. Everything is great about this vehicle, even down to how solid the doors close.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Bluetooth feature is great no wire, just one button, nothing in my ear and I don't have turn down the stereo ALL at the same time. AUX in for iPod connection is great. The trunk is huge and it comes with a flip up divider. The adjustable cup holders are also a great feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>On it's way in for service after a month. Bolts(3 so far) keep falling off from somewhere and sticking to the speaker magnets. The back tailight assembly is coming loose. And there is a banging coming from the front end. The gas gauge keeps jumping all over never know exactly how much gas is in the car. Gas mileage is way below my daughters 09 corolla. Contrary to what others say this is not a japaneese car read the windows. Looking to dump this garbage heap.</TEXT>

<TEXT> Driving Impressions: CVT is something we'll have to get used to, steering/suspension are a little tight, very good gas mileage, accel. is very good considering it's a 4-cyclinder. Interior is decent, trunk space kinds folled me, didn't realize there was a hidden compartment at first. Vehicle was purchased for my wife, she likes it, even though she preferred the Scion.</TEXT>

Quiet ride, inteligent key...is real nice got spoiled to that in a hurry. I got the xm with fosgate stereo....awsome stereo. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Although maybe not though of as a true performance car this nissan spev v has surprised me at every turn of the key. The suspension is taut and firm but never complains.. shove it into a corner and it performs. The lowered stance and stylin wheels give the car an edgy but not too over the top look while the details once you notice them are very satisfying. I love that it has plenty of power on tap and that it has plenty of room inside for my big frame. The instruments are big and easy to read and electronics are easy to use. Premium fuel is high nowadays but so is filling up a larger car with regular. I think the interior of this car is superior to larger more expensive cars.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went to the dealership not expecting to like the Sentra. Coming from a Buick Century, I thought, "oh, a small, Japanese 4-cyl, well, at least it has a warranty." Then I took it for a test drive. The engine / transmission combination on even the 2.0 S model blows my old car away, and blows away my friends' Civics, Yarises, and even older V6-equipped cars. The interior leaves very little to be desired. Fuel economy is ridiculous compared to what I'm used to (avg. 30, city and highway), and I bought it without even trying the amazing stock stereo system. This drives like a much more expensive car, and swaddles you with geek-chic tech to make sure you don't forget it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After testing several cars including the Corolla, Focus and Mazda 3, the Sentra was the best choice. The interior room is as big or bigger than my 2003 Dodge Stratus. This is the perfect choice in a bad economy with insane gas prices. I beleive the Sentra will be the next smart size family sedan replacing midsize cars, which are quickly become todays gas guzzlers.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Sentra is quiet and super comfortable, I do not miss midsize cars now at all. What a tremendous improvement for Nissan over the old smaller Sentra I owned in the 1995.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I don't really care for small cars. I once had a 1994 Sentra and it was too small. I had my heart set on a 2008 Max, but with the gas as high as it is, I'm glad I got the Sentra. I am very impressed with this car, the speed, the interior, the exterior. The style is awesome, looks like a mini Max, if the Sentra still had the body style that they had before 2007, I would not have purchased it. The 2008 Sentra has much more room, and the accessories are the best. There are only 2 things I don't like about this car and that is the tight steering and as with any small car, the wind blows it around. I would recommend this car to anyone, plus I'm a Nissan woman.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Originally I was interested in the Versa until I realized I could have the Sentra for a little more. I found the Sentra very roomy and lots of nice little extras such as a trip computer that will display, time, outside temp, and average fuel economy amongst other things. The Sentra is peppy with very good mpg and handles well. The styling is modern and the ride very quiet compared to our Sonata.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got a really good deal on my Sentra, that's the good news. The rest is mostly negative. The driving position is very uncomfortable for me. I am an average size woman 5'6" and I find the seats too small. If it was a purchase from any place other than a car dealership, I would have returned it for refund in the first week. But I'm stuck with it for years. It has been in the shop 5 times. The clutch makes a noise when depressed and again when released. The side windows rattle in their seals. After 2,500 miles, the Service Engine Soon light came on and the cruise control stopped working. I definitely should have spent more time test-driving this car and exploring other options!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our 3rd sentra, and by far, the best. We had 2 of the 2001 SE models, 1 with 5 speed, and 1 with automatic. I was leery of the CVT, but it feels great now. I think it will last a long time, especially the way that my wife drives it. She'll baby it. Already the mileage is better than the old cars got at their best. The engine is more fuel efficient, while being bigger by 500 cc. We expect high 30 mpg once broken it. The SE-R has anti-lock 4 wheel disc brakes and stiffer suspension than the car with 2.0 engine. It handles so much better. The car is quiet and road noise is filtered out so well. The stereo system is better as is the AC. So much colder. We love it</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has surpassed all expectations. After trying honda civic, toyola corolla/camry, scion, matrix, mazda3, this car had everything in it that were options for the rest. Moonroof, CVT, ABS, leather seats, Bluetooth, XM satellite, fog lights, hidden trunk compartment,alarm, and the best~ Intelligent Key entry. As long as the remote is on you, you don't have to dig around for it to open the door or start your car. The ride is so smooth, like a boat on water. I don't want to stop driving. My boyfriend is 5'11" and loved driving it. Especially the CVT. There is ample room and my friends are impressed with the drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I should have bought the Civic. Purchased this vehicle Feb. 29, 2008. This vehicle is like a tin can on wheels. The wind noise is prominent and there are numerous rattles from doors and trim. The weather strips around the front doors are coming apart. This is not a luxury drive and the bumps in the road will confirm this; you will feel it in the seat of your pants and can be clearly heard in the cabin. Tap on the panels and trunk and you will get a hollow sound. The fuel economy is way below the advertised rating. The foot pedals are too close and any foot above a size 9 will be in for trouble. The arm rest is more like an elbow rest. This is a terrible car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The fit and finish is awful. The hood and trunk are off center.The trunk so much it almost touches the rear 1/4 panel on one side and has a 1/4 inch gap on the other. The plastic dash is not smooth and the edges stick up. The cheap labor shows here. The eyeglass holder is so hard to open you wind up pulling it from the dash. I dont even use it anymore. Bumps can be teeth jarring. Gas mileage is less than stellar. At this pricepoint there are much better choices. Shop around. This car will be going back at lease end and I will be back at Ford.

<TEXT>Looked at GTIs, civic si, minis, Astra, the usual sporty compact crowd. Drove the Sentra Spec V and it just seemed to do everything well where all the others did some stuff better, but fell short in other ways. The Sentra fit my needs - more space, great mpg, Nissan gave me moonroof, LS diff, xm radio, fun ride but not brutal, torque means any gear pulls great. Love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always liked the look of Nissans. I was interested in the Altima but didn't want to spend that much on a car. Did not want a used car either. I test drove the Sentra and once I found out all of the toys (convenience package) you can get, I was sold. I was also looking at the Mazda 3 but I was sold with the blue tooth phone and keyless ignition (I will never buy a car without that again)! The car is fun to drive and for the few times I carry more than one other passenger with me, it has proven to be a champ with passengers and for transporting stuff in the trunk/backseat area. I definitely made the right decision with this car. I had a great dealer experience as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Had all intentions to buy a 2009 Corolla S. Test drove a Sentra S. It was excellent! A ton better than the Corolla. It has lots more room and the CVT is quite impressive. Didn't think I would really use the bluetooth and keyless entry, but after a few days I love those features (I opted for the convenience package). Smooth transitions the whole time on the CVT, so far getting great mileage. I got a great deal on my 2008 and am quite happy so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car looked great on the lot and was a good test drive in warm/dry weather. The CVT was wonderful, but that's where the positives end. In windy weather or passing transports the car is buffetted horribly and handling in snowy or icy conditions is extremely poor. If I lived in a warm weather locale, perhaps my experience would be better. We are presently upgrading to an Altima as my wife doesn't feel safe driving our Sentra over long distances or on major highways. We are both experienced compact car drivers and this Sentra has been a horrible disappointment.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car to get better MPG and I am pleased, CVT is awesome, it's not even broken in and gets 29.9 MPG. Thats with about 25% highway miles. Big difference coming from a 05 Xterra. Glad I didn't buy the Civic I was considering. My car is twice as quiet and rides smoother. The sentra information center blows the civic away, o/s temp,average MPGs, trip timer, etc. Better sound system.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has been a huge disappointment for me. Any wind tends to blow it all over the road & it feels like I am wrestling a pickup or semi. The wind tends to suck the car sideways and blow it to the point that I have to turn the steering wheel 30 degrees off to hold it on the road on a day where the wind is 20 mph which sucks. Also on snowy days it tends to want to fishtail. Fuel economy is at best is 28 though typically 27 on the highway compared to my camry which got a solid 30. The seats are not comfy for anyone even slightly over weight as the location of the seat belts tends to jab, even 128lb daughter complains about it. Also the steering is very stiff.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I must say, when I stopped at the Nissan dealer, I wasn't even considering a Sentra. But as soon as I sat in it, I knew I had to get it on the road. The test drive confirmed what I already knew when I first sat in the car. I was in love!! The car's smooth ride and shifting is seamless thanks to the CVT. I'm a tall girl, 5'9 and it is extremely roomy even in the back seat. I ended up getting the "Convenience Package" and it was well worth it. I had every intention of buying a Civic, but you get SO much more for your money with the Sentra. I LOVE MY NEW CAR!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I just purchased the car today. I just wanted to say I didn't know what to expect with this car. Well, to my surprise so far on the first day it drives extremely quiet and has pretty good power for a 4 cylinder. The CVT works great. Just takes a little while to get used to. Overall, we both love the car and are impressed with all the features of the SL model. It's also very roomy inside and I'm over 6'0" and have plenty of leg and head room. We were going to buy a Civic but I'm glad we went with the Sentra. I would recommend test driving this car. You will like it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In mid October I purchased my Sentra for an amazing price, new from the dealership. I had test drove the new Civic and Accord but unless leased they were out of my price range. I drove the Sentra and instantly fell in love. The advertised gas mileage was just what I was looking for. Almost 5000 miles later this is the best vehicle I have bought yet. It has acceleration even with the CVT and a quality interior as well as a sound system to match. The bluetooth phone is outstanding and the car is quiet. Recently I drove it through the mountains on the way to North Carolina and it was a joyful drive. This car really outperforms all that I test drove and its one you can't beat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I heard that the sentra was a very reliable car. We have an 97 altima in the family with over 220K miles. My last two cars (cavalier & integra) went over 230K miles and I hope to go to 300K on this one. Looked at Civic, but just out of price range. This car is packed with features features for the price. The inside is unbelievably comfortable and I am 6 feet all. Dash layout is great. Gas mileage improves with every fill up. Don't rely on the trip comuter to tell you your mileage. I found that by doing the math myself I am getting around 34 MPG. Trip computer tell me 30. I drive about 70% highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I didn't really know what to expect from this Sentra. I was pretty worried because i need to drive a lot (I commute to and from school 3 days/wk and go to work 7 days/wk). Knowing that I need to drive so much to and from school, friends, and work, I needed a reliable car. This is the first 4 cyl car and the gas mileage is almost the same as my 6cyl Century which is a disappointment. I have 5k miles on it and no problems. I got the base model with wheel locks because I plan to get rims for it next year. I wouldn't recommend the black, which I have. Too hard to keep clean but the car is great and so quiet! A must have.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Moving from a 1991 Nissan Sentra to this beauty is like winning the lottery: you knew it would be good, but you're still in shock about it. My 91 Sentra made it 160,000 miles without engine problems, a strong factor in my decision to buy Nissan again. The car performs exceptionally well for the price and the CVT works adeptly for someone whose main driving habits are mostly city commuting. The power is not overwhelming, but it is there at a moments notice when you need it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system is tops, as well as the wheels and braking performance. Interior is comfortable yet sparse. Also, the back seat is very accomodating.

<TEXT>Bought a new 2008 Sentra S back in Feb and have had an ongoing issue with the transmission. Any time I ease off the accelerator in 4th, 5th and 6th gear, I can hear a high pitched whining sound. Started noticing it before 1,000 miles and brought it to the dealership. They test drove the car and told me it was normal. The sound kept getting louder and the dealership agreed to replace the transmission at 2,500 miles. The sound was still their after the swap, just not as loud. 6,500 miles on the car now and whine is back. Nissan says it is normal once again and refuses requests for additional work on car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Second Review here. After 3500 miles. Here is how we feel about the car. Its very smooth. Period. The CVT is not bad to drive once you get used to pushing the throttle and letting it do its thing. I have had zero problems. Everything is working like day 1. Now a few suggestions. The arm rest stinks and the seat is a little soft but I like the height adjustment. Averaging over 30mpg, but I expected more. The readout on the dash is about 1.5 mpg optimistic. Got better with my VW Passat. The electric power steering feels a little 'soft'. Overall I would still recommend this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased my black 2.0 after several months of research. Drove many comparable models, domestic and foreign. My first impression and that of my wife, who first drove the car this morning, is great car. The CVT. It was a snowmobile to me first, but it really seems to work. Road noise? A little, but that's what radios are for. I was looking for a stripped down daily driver and found this rather impressively equipped S model for a better price than the others. You know who you are. Since this car has all of 36 miles in it, I'm marking the build quality and reliability in the middle. Check back. </TEXT>

Before I even reached my first 1000 miles, I felt that the car's brakes didn't stop the way they should. My husband thought I was being paranoid but it kept driving funny. Finally, I decided to take it in by 3000 miles to get checked. I was told, "Oh, by the way, the brake master cylinder needs to be replaced. It has been recalled." No one ever contacted me saying this part, a major part for stopping the car properly, was recalled. I barely feel safe driving this car and I have to drive my children.

<TEXT>I have owned 6 new cars in the past 4 years, with the Nissan Sentra being my 6th car. I got a more basic model. Granted this is no Toyota Camry or Infiniti G35x, it serves its purpose - a commuter car where I didn't have to dish out an extra $10K for a Prius and averaged 30.5 mpg (mixed city/hwy). For anyone who complains about the quality, the way I see it, you get what you pay for. You didn't buy a luxury car. Personally, I think this is a fun car to drive. It's the smallest car I've driven so far, but it has some good power and acceleration. If you are looking for a reliable car to get you from point A to B, then keep the Sentra in mind. </TEXT>

The inside doors do scratch easily, but I got sick of spending $1000 for 3 different GM cars for replacing the head gaskets. GMC stands for good mechanic constantly. It has been a great car. We have put 17500 miles on it since November of 2007 and have not had any problems, I can't say that about the GM cars I have owned.

When driving in town, I try to challenge myself. When I accelerate, I try and keep the RPM below 2000RPM. Once I hit about 10 or 15MPH, the RPM drops and I push a little more on the accelerator and move quicker all the while keeping the RPM under 2000 and the gas mileage up. Opted for the keyless and sound pack. The stereo is unbelievable.</TEXT>

The display on the radio/trip info is large and very easy to see. The biggest problem I have had is interior rattles.

We took the car back to the dealer and he said that the back tires were half worn out and he knew what the problem was, he changed the rear sub frames and torsion bar and said that he already changed these items on numerous Nissan Sentras and they were a factory defect, but Nissan will not cover the cost of new tires even though its their fault that they are worn out, Until these items are fixed THIS CAR IS VERY DANGEROUS </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car!!! I almost chose the SPEC-V, but my girlfriend does not know how to drive standard, so that's that.

The stereo is great, but wished it played MP3s; I am 6'3 and pretty big, and it fits me like a cadillac would. I bought an extended warranty only because CVT is a new technology, and did not want to get stuck with a $4000 bill if the tranny fails.

It has good low end torque and will cruise effortlessly at 80+. Be sure to get the upgraded stereo system. Try it and you just might be hooked like I was. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Simply great car. It is considered compact, but inside is bigger that Hondas and Toyotas. Very quiet ride, CVT works great, especially going up hills. Suspension maybe a bit stiff, reminds me German cars tuned for speed, sits very well on a road. Engine is strong and if you step on it it goes. The whole car feels very well constructed and tuned. The basic stereo offers 4 6/9 speakers, plenty of power, imaging is very good. Fuel consumption is good, not as good as Toyota Yaris or Corolla, but engine is bigger and stronger.This car in my opinion, is currently, the best value on the market period. Does what it was designed to do: offers comfortable reliable ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car nearly one month and put on over 1800 miles. Mileage is very good with an average of 30.8 mpg in mixed city and highway driving. Rides nice, CVT is very smooth and idles so quietly, at first I thought it stalled! Nice car overall, but not an exciting drive, but then it's not meant to be. Does everything well enough. Only gripes so far is the driver's side sun visor hits the rear view mirror and therefore makes looking out very difficult unless you duck under it or keep moving the mirror out of the way. Wish it had a trunk release on the fob like my Jeep does. Good quality construction, but beware of blind spots with small, oddly shaped outside mirrors. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We test drove the Versa,Cobalt, Caliber, Yaris, Elantra, M3, and the Saturn equivalent. Versa drove the best but was just a tad too small. Then I said, let's try the Sentra! WOW! I knew right away that was the car. Great pickup, GREAT MPG (32 overall, sometimes 37 on the highway). Last weekend was the real test - we got a 9X12 carpet in and closed the trunk!

<TEXT>I have had my Sentra for about 3 months In the 3 months I have had this car there have been some quality issues both mechanically and build quality Mechanically the engine is very reliable but I will advise you there is a recall on the brakes and most 2008 Sentras have this problem if you take it to Nissan they will fix it free of charge under the warranty. Also the CVT is reliable and smooth but it does make a droning sound when windows are down and does lack on acceleration when not really pushing the car. As for build quality I have to say the exterior is well made but avoid the beige interior it scratches very easily and get very dirty. Overall average car at a average value.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This Sentra replaced my Honda Civic Hybrid (too expensive to keep when I switched jobs and started driving 15 miles a day.) The Sentra is a great performer... nice acceleration, comfortable ride, though the suspension is a bit stiff. Interior comfort is excellent. I feel like I have plenty of room, and I'm a large guy. Fuel economy has been excellent - getting 35 MPG highway, and about 26 in the city. Great trunk design. Controls are easy to use and well placed. Seats are comfortable. The only nitpick is the lack of two power outlets, which I understand they fixed in the 2009 version. Great car for the price!</TEXT>

The keyless entry feature is great I haven't used my key since i left the dealership. It has a smooth look, all the bells and whistles I could ever want all under 20K. Gas is great and even better since the price is starting to drop. The acceleration is good and despite what other reviewers say I have virtually no outside noise.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wondering about MPG? If I keep my foot out of it I can average 30 mpg. Usual avg is 27. I get 36 mpg hwy in 6th going 55-60 mph. It can run on regular, no problems, but I use premium for more power. I installed an Injen CAI and it SIGNIFICANTLY made more power. Worth every penny and with about 3 months of use no problems. The seats are very comfortable on long trips. The trunk is huge. The glove box is huge. I outrun CooperS, GTI, VR6 no problems. The affordable price is great. Not as fast as a Speed3 but it costs $5-$6k less. Avoid the Rockford stereo. It sounds good when not moving. But roll windows down and it is easily drowned out. Tires are great dry, bad in snow.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Shifter location, black interior, head room, hip room, seats are great, subdued exterior look-- no big spoilers or hood scoops.

<TEXT>This is a great car. We were first attracted to the elevated seat height, about 6 inches higher than Altima or Maxima. There is plenty of headroom and legroom for my 6'5" frame. The car is very smooth and quiet on the road (think Buick) and handles very well. Very little body lean while cornering (think Jetta). The CVT works very well but it took some getting used to. Forget the tachometer and just drive. Aggressive driving has very little effect on fuel economy. It accelerates very nicely if you step on it. I have been getting 30+ MPG in suburban driving and 35 MPG on trips. It is the quietest car I have owned. You can carry on a normal conversation will passengers in the front or back.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I picked up the SE-R in May of 2008 to replace my 2000 Grand AM GT. This car is well worth it. Excellent mileage. It looks great, not too over the top. Acceleration is brisk, but not rocket fast. It handles well with a sporty feel, corners better than my Grand Am GT ever did. The interior is roomy and can fit 3 booster seats for kids across the back row (tight fit, but it works). Front seats are great. Trunk is large and easy to access. Upgraded Rockford Fosgate Stereo is powerful and clear. 6 Disc changer is a nice feature, but most will use their MP3 players in the aux jack more than the changer. Gripes are few, no cup holders in the rear and back bench does not split or fold.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the paddle shifters for those times when you want to have some fun. 17" rims look great. XM radio is a nice touch, and the stereo sounds great. Love the adjustable cupholders.

<TEXT>I have 5,250 miles on my Sentra, and I absolutely love it. I had a 2006 Sentra, but there is no comparison. It is perfect for a small family, even when traveling. The back seat is quite comfortable. I was not getting a new car until one with leather and a sunroof was in my budget. Well, I got that plus blue tooth, upgraded stereo, keyless, and more. Gas mileage has been excellent - 30 when mostly in town, 35-38 on hwy. Gas mileage drops quickly if you drive aggressively, so I have had to really adjust to get the better efficiency. Final deciding factor - Nissan negotiates! I got it for $2,000 below dealer cost and in the color I wanted (transferred in).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very quiet interior, makes the Fosgate stereo sound terrific. Puts my VW Jetta interior and "advanced" sound system to shame. Sport suspension is nice and tight. You feel the big bumps but don"t bounce on the small and medium. No leaning in cornering, which you can do very fast due to the road hugging ability. At 400 miles, MPG is combined 28.5 with about 80% being highway. Mileage on highway was about 31.8 when I reset the computer. No initial defects found, very happy with the 6 speed manual transmission. The 200 HP let you use 2, 4 and 6th gears for normal driving. 1 & 2 get you into or across traffic fast, and 3 & 4 can make you feel like you are on a good roller coaster if you want.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With over 10,000 miles on the car I'm overall pleased with it. Before it hit 1,000 miles the check engine light went on (the bad one where you can only drive 45 mph) and I had to drive home 300 miles going 45 mph. Not too happy about that, but the problem was fixed- gas tank issue. Killed the new car feel. I have NEVER gotten over 31 MPG. I've driven it on 400 mile FLAT high ways driving 55. Tires, pressure, gas, windows up or down it does not seem to budge. The inside scratches VERY easily inside. No matter how much I clean it, it's pretty much dirtied inside from just a shoe touching the interior. The exterior it sturdy, but a shopping cart going super slow caused a small little dent.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched Civic, Corolla and Sentra before deciding to buy the Sentra. I was impressed by its size and feel. Sentra was bigger, longer and wider then both Civic and Corolla. Even though I liked the looks of Civic more, I choose Sentra because of some key striking features. The gear shift knob was moved towards the dash to make more room in the driver's cabin. The CVT feature made the drive very smooth. I chose the intelligent key feature and the music system had an auxiliary jack which enabled me to play my iPod. All this combined with good looks convinced me to go for Sentra. I am very happy with the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After a month of diligent research, my wife and I decided on the Nissan Sentra S Model. We test drove the Civic, Jetta, Corolla. Although this is an "economy" car, you would never know it with all of the wonderful and useful features that it has. For starters, the design is really nice and modern. The glove compartment is huge, by far the largest of any car we test drove. The LCD display screen and on board computer is really neat and displays some useful information (average mpg, average speed, temperature, time, etc.). The fit and finish of the car is superb and really has a solid feel to it. The CVT is so smooth and really beats traditional transmissions in my opinion.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With over 20,000 miles on the car, I am very pleased with the Sentra. I use it to commute ~40 miles each way per day. Add to that weekend day trips and one 2,400 mile trip. I drive with a light foot most of the time (engine about 2,500 rpm while accelerating), and I find it smooth and quiet. When driven hard, it can be noisier than some of it's peers. It has plenty of power for passing and mountain driving, even fully loaded. It find it very comfortable, even on long trips. I average 34-36 mpg driving the speed limit (65-70) in typical highway commuting, but as low as 27 mpg with mostly short trips. I've gotten as high as 38 mpg on a tank-full on the open road at 65 mph.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The CVT is excellent and the first transmission I've ever driven that is cruise-control friendly when on hills and rolling terrain. Intelligent key and built-in hands free are nice touches. OD-off button good for engine braking and occasionally increasing responsiveness. Safer than most peers.</FAVORITE>

Great handling and speed, we feel safe in the car, I would highly recommend this car, and I had a 1995 Nissan Altima with 224,000 Miles and traded it in, Nissan makes a great car, although it could use a better warranty like a KIA or Hyundai.

<TEXT>Had good experience with previous Nissans, so felt comfortable with the Sentra. Was looking for economy, as my Titan is a great truck, but lousy commuter vehicle. The Sentra is my first 4 cylinder car in 20 years, and is surprisingly fun to own and drive. Gas mileage beats the EPA numbers - all city driving gives me about 27 mpg, and a recent trip across the PA turnpike produced 36 mpg. Let's face it, this is basically an entry level car, but loaded with many features. Just about all of my passengers are impressed with the performance of the engine, and the smoothness of the transmission. This car has everything - good styling, great economy, and expected Nissan quality. No probs so far</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased this car from a used car shop and it only had 8,000 miles. We love the roominess and the wide front window. We have a black car and it looks so nice when we walk up to it somewhere. The real problem for us is that there is only a key entry on the driver's side. This is extremely inconvenient. If you are parked and want to put your elderly parent, young children, packages, poochie into the car you have to leave them there and go around into traffic. It was a stupid design "feature" and Nissan wasn't aware of it when I called. Go figure. They are to get back to me but I doubt it. Otherwise for driving around town it is pretty good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the SE-R in June and have been driving it over a month. I went from a BMW 525i to this car. It is very fun to drive and very responsive. So far the gas mileage is 21 mpg, but I certainly am on the pedal a lot. Of course the interior is not like a BMW, but the acceleration is just as good as the 525. I drove the Focus, standard Sentra, Corolla, and Saturn VUE Hybrid (on a whim) and the Sentra SE-R put a smile on my face like no other. When going 80 on the highway I can feel the wind more than in the BMW, but it isn't bad and the rest of the time it is great. Here in LA I don't get lots of opportunities to drive 80 on the freeways anyways. Thanks to all who wrote reviews!</TEXT>

It's no racer, but it has plenty of pep and cruises very nicely at 65 mph. The CVT is very smooth.

<TEXT>Purchased Sentra for wife to drive. Needed better mileage than the Ford Explorer she had. Ride is good, also excellent A/C, good design, good back seat space, adequate trunk space, but small trunk opening will not accept many packages. Steering is stiff and requires a solid grip while driving on the highway. MPG is very disappointing as it is 23.5 city, and 25.9 highway. We drive with a soft foot and take off slowly and drive moderate speeds.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior space and good A/C.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Several nice features at a great price. I have had the car two weeks and am very happy. I am averaging 28mpg with mixed driving and 34 on the highway. I don't find the that the car has any road noise issues at all. In strong winds the car does seem to drift a bit. Overall handing and acceleration is great and love the CVT. Interior room is awesome as I am 6'2" . I have had 4 adults in the car with no comfort issues at all. In fact, I feel more comfortable in the Sentra than the Civic. Controls are laid out well 18 radio station presets plus an iPod jack. So, at this point I would purchase again without any doubts. Luxury features at a great price. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the Blue Tooth and the audio controls. Trunk room is great and the divider is wonderful. The smart key system is nice feature as well. I love not having to take the keys out of my pocket </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I went from driving various trucks for 20 years to the Nissan Sentra. Like for many, gas prices drove the change. I evaluated all the small car options from: Mazda, Ford, Toyota, Chevrolet, Honda, Hyundai, and VW. This took me 4 weeks to complete. For a loaded every option Sentra SL, I feel like the time spent was well worth it. I'm getting about 32 mpg mixed and almost 36 mpg on the freeway. The ride is very comfortable. I was a little skeptical of the CVT at first but I am a fan now. This is really a smooth drive. It's almost too comfortable in the leather seats and cruise control zipping down the freeway with the moonroof open and XM on! All I can say is: Buy it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT, moonroof, leather seats made a big comfort change compared to the cloth, Steering wheel controls, Bluetooth, Intelligent Key system keeps the keys put away for vehicle access and driving, the split trunk storage is nice also. Glove box space is really huge.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I needed an economical compact sedan that is reliable and safe and was very impressed with how much interior space and passenger room the Sentra has. Also very impressive was how smooth, refined and responsive the CVT and engine were, particularly its power and acceleration for a car of this class when carrying 4 full-sized adults and a trunk loaded with stuff. The Sentra has the most incentives at this time by at least $500, and you can get bluetooth and keyless remote entry for not much more. I saved at least $2,000 by purchasing this vehicle over a comparatively equipped Honda Civic LX in the current market. The Sentra is a very versatile, capable, and fuel efficient daily commuter car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Large and versatile interior and passenger space, very responsive and smooth engine and transmission, factory cash incentives, bluetooth and remote keyless entry with convenience package, split folding rear seats and trunk divider, quality of cloth upholstery, quality of dash materials, size of car</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car drives great. I was concerned when reading reviews after hearing that the car was uncomfortable to ride in, and that there was more noise than other cars, but when I test drove, I did not notice any of these. The car is as smooth as any I have ever been in, and road noise is no higher than any car I test drove, including the Civic. It handles a bit better than the Civic and other cars I tried as well. Where it really shines, then, is the feature set. No other entry level car I looked could match the Sentra. I got an auxiliary jack for my iPod, steering wheel audio controls, and a bluetooth phone system. Not even the Civic could match that.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great gas mileage, auxiliary input, bluetooth phone, comfortable, nice looking interior. Nissan cars are generally reliable. Excellent safety features</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just traded in my 2004 Expedition for the Sentra. It broke my heart. But you have to do what you have to do. For not being a "car" person, so far I love it. The outside is sporty the inside is comfy. A lot of great features for the money. My only complaint is that I am not crazy about the mileage yet. The car only has 600 miles on it so far. I guess you have to "break in" the engine. Or so I have read. And I don't drive like a nut either so I was expecting more miles than I am getting. From just about empty it costs $52 to fill up at $3.97 a gallon where I live. Overall, I am happy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT is pretty cool, has awesome pick up, hope that's not killing my gas mileage. I love the interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Sentra had everything I was looking for, fantastic fuel economy, power, economy and great styling. I drove the corolla as well, and there was just no comparison in how it felt. Upon taking the test drive, I knew immediately this was the car for me. The fuel economy is very good as well. I've been getting 28-30 mpg on average with mixed driving, and up to 35 during pure highway driving. Did I mention its fun to drive? The CVT is so smooth and I feel that I'm getting better fuel efficiency without sacrificing power. The styling is great. I think it looks like a much more expensive car. The convenience package is definitely a must.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Perfectly fine vehicle to get from point A to point B. The ride was fairly smooth compared to other cars in the segment. I like the brisk acceleration. The doors had a good solid feel. This is the first car to get me car sick as a drive as the car rolled around in fast turns. I only averaged 28 mpg on the highway with the Sentra. This was probably due to the ride height, springy gas pedal and CVT config. Nissan still needs to improve their build quality. Plastic looked like they came out of a generic brand toy. Bottom line, you can get better driving dynamics, build quality, fuel economy or value with a Corolla, Civic or a Mazda3.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Not too many miles driven, but they've been good miles thus far. 6 speed took a while to get used to, but that's because I transferred from a Jeep. It has plenty of power for an economy car, loads of features, and looks very sharp (I got the black). I'm 6'2 and I still have a few inches from the ceiling. Everything is placed well, besides maybe the center console (nowhere to rest my elbow while shifting). Trunk is HUGE, engine compartment open and easy to access (this will be great 5 to 10 years from now). The base radio leaves a little to be desired, bluetooth a little clumsy (not synched well for my phone brand). Quiet, comfortable, does 80 just fine, cruises at low speeds well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Center controls (A/C, radio, trip computer). Trip computer about as good as the Chevy Malibus. Also the roomy engine area (you can almost fit a second engine in there).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The new Sentra has 2800 miles on it and was purchased about 7 weeks ago. Vehicle has been completely reliable, as a new car should be. It's a very comfortable highway cruiser, with a smooth quiet ride and reasonably comfortable seats in a roomy interior. Build quality is good, but some of the interior plastic parts (like the dash top, sun visors and cubby holes) could really use some improvement. Styling is attractive to most people, especially in the "magnetic gray" paint. Interior is a charcoal gray, which is somewhat depressing color, but it hides dirt fairly well. It has plenty of space for 4 adults, but trying to put 3 adults into the back seat is not a good idea - not enough hip room.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car gets excellent gas mileage that averages about 30 mpg in mixed driving. The trunk is huge for a compact car and is roomy inside for 4 people. It has a smooth and quiet highway ride. Price was reasonable given all of the safety features (ABS, front, side, and side curtain airbags).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car really has a lot of quality in what is a mid compact or smaller size car. The interior package and smooth handling makes you think your in a higher price car models. Great features, fuel averaging and mileage eta, 3 trip mileage meters, blue tooth, mp3 jacks, 18 station presets, keyless start and security engine kill override system. You dont even need to take the keyless remote out of your pocket or purse you just push the unlock button on the door handle with the keyless fob in your pocket and it unlocks the car. Gas pump door is secured and has to be released from inside the car reducing gas theft. Every day I drive it I fall in love with it more. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Keyless remote, all the leg room you get in this car front and back. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 2.5L DOHC 4 cyl with perfect balance is made in Japan and gets its maximum torque at 2800 rpm. The CVT senses the engine is very strong and sets itself with high speed gearing to save fuel with low engine rpm: 1600 rpm at 60mph and 1200rpm at 45mph for over 27 mph while brand new. Ride is taut yet bumps fully absorbed. Steering is outstanding with 34 ft turn radius and a dead-flat-level suspension. Exterior is very striking and attractive. Paddle shifters on steering wheel allow CVT to be shifted like a six-speed..a way-cool feature. Intelligent tranny will perceive your foot off the gas on a downhill and drop the gearing to provide engine braking automatically without needing brakes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Low speed torque = surprising fuel economy. Quiet, bump absorbing ride with outstanding maneuverablity and terrific wheels and tires. Seating quality in SE-R way superior to regular seating. Highly recommend. CVT integrates with power seamlessly and can be shifted like a 6-speed manual. Sharp car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Our biggest disappointment is that there is no key entry on the passenger side. It is a safety concern for us. What do you do when you are trying to get an elderly person, child or pet into the car at a curb and have to go into traffic leaving the aforementioned person alone. It is inconvenient if not downright safe. What if you have packages? You leave them on the sidewalk and have to go to the driver's side. Down right stupid feature... feature???? it is just a stupid cost cutting measure.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only put 500 miles on my new Sentra, but so far I love it! Fun to drive, especially after driving an SUV for the past several years. The Sentra is amazingly quiet, and smooth. I'm not sure why some are having lower gas MPG. I am getting between 34 and 35 MPG as an average. I commute 20 miles each way to work, about 2/3 highway and 1/3 city. No problems on the gas mileage for me!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car rides better than my Lincoln. The sticker said 25 city/ 33 hwy but I have been watching it and I am getting 38 Hwy and 29 city. This car has it all, style, mpg, ride. Need to look at this. I looked at Honda Fit, Civic, Accord and Toyota Corolla and Camry and Focus and Fusion. Spent 3 weeks shopping. The Sentra is about 3000.00 cheaper but delivers more. Check it out. I am trading my truck in and getting another.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Test drove everything in it's class (Honda, Toyota, and many others etc.) and the Sentra is the clear winner. Quiet, fast, loaded with options that rival much more expensive luxury cars. Bluetooth, Fosgate stereo satellite XM radio, an incredible keyless ignition system, huge trunk with hidden compartment, awesome gas mileage, moonroof. Did I mention quiet? Smooth luxury car type ride. No other car remotely matched acceleration and ride quality. Test drove against a much more expensive BMW and Sentra is a much, much, much better value. Why would anyone buy anything else??</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet, smooth luxury car ride totally missing from competitors. Outstanding cornering ability! Gas mileage and controls easy to use and easy to use from the steering wheel to keep your eyes on the road.</FAVORITE>
