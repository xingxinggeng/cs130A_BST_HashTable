<TEXT>Real off-road capability in a world of "soft-roaders." This vehicle benefits greatly from Jeep's involvement with Daimler and as a result it's an interesting mix of American and German input. Fuel mileage isn't great overall, but I am consistently observing higher than EPA ratings, particularly at highway cruising speeds.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>5.7L Hemi w/MDS, off-road capability, perceived quality of interior, towing capacity. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased used w/ 12k on the odo. So far, it's been great. The 4x4 works great and has already gotten me out of a bind. The interior is very comfortable and usable. The 3rd row does not get used much, but it's good to have just in case. I got a flat, and while changing the tire was straight forward, the steel wheel spare is way too heavy. I'm a big guy that works out 2-3 times a week, and had a hard time lifting it up on the studs. Can't find many other faults. Throttle response is on the slow side, need brighter headlights. Gas door needs to lock when car is locked. Better gas mileage, but it is the V8 and 4wd, so 15-16mpg overall is ok I guess.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4.7l v8 & 4wd. (despite the mpg) Comfortable leather seating Remote start. E85 capability if gas goes to $4 again. Jeep green color & towing package. - Reverse warning sensors.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Haven't had the vehicle for but 3 weeks. Bought it used for half the price of what it cost new. It is truly one of the most enjoyable vehicles I have ever driven. I love the look and feel of it. The windows make visibility the best I have ever experienced except for the rear window view when the 3rd row seating is in place. The whole family loves it! We have had vans for most of our "family" years and wanted to get away from the whole van thing. This was a GREAT choice and I would definitely recommend one to anyone else. There are pros and cons to any vehicle. I believe the pros definitely outweigh the cons in this one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The look of it, the ground clearance and the overall driving of it is enjoyable. There are standard features that would be upgrades for most other manufacturers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We previously owned a Jeep Liberty and had to upgrade in size. The Liberty was a great Jeep, so we decided to stay in the Jeep family. For a family of four, the Commander has been awesome. The kids love riding in the third row because their feet reach the floor - only suitable for little ones because there's no leg room. The front is very spacious and controls are easily accessible to both the driver and passenger. I don't much care that there isn't much storage behind the third row when it's up, but it wasn't a deal breaker by any means. We look forward to our road trip next month because we'll have plenty of room for comfort and storage. Overall we are very pleased with this vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Third row for the kids - keeps them out of adult conversations. Stadium seating allows small children to see out the windows better. A/C vents and control in rear are a MUST have in Texas. Middle row three way fold down is very convenient also. Back up sensors are great when 3rd row is up.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After owning about 8 new jeeps over the past 16 years i was very impressed with the commander. My prior 06 commander had the 4.7 V8 and was underpowered. The HEMI is just right. I purchased a loaded overland model as it is truly the ultimate Jeep. The rear camera is helpful especially when using the third seat. It is a very solid vehicle. I like the styling as it reminds me of my first 1993 jeep cherokee country. I average 16mpg and on a round trip to Cleveland from Albany NY my average was 18. I drove around 70 mph. I really don't know why the press beats upon Jeep products so much. I have found Jeeps to be very reliable, safe, and fun to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>HEMI motor,U Connect feature, Love the interior with the Overland features. I don't have to shovel the snow out of my driveway. I can ride all my family in it and still tow a heavy trailer in comfort.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had all kinds of electrical problems with this car, since I purchased it. The dealership was not very helpful. The locks locked while I stepped out of the car, and the car was running. They lock and unlock as I am driving. Auto wipers don't work that great, and neither does the reverse assistance. The Sirius equipment was faulty. The angle of the windshield, makes it very prone to getting hit by road debris--I replaced two windshields within six months. The breaks had to be replaced within the year, and six months later, need it again. I have never had so many problems with a car. The problems returned about six months after repair. No leg room in the middle seat area.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very pleased with the ride and roadability both in the city in the highway. My compliments to for the new re-engineered 4.7 and refinement of 5- 45fre autotrans being one of the best rans out there, period! The offering of creature comforts is higher than most Benz's! This vehilce is a keeper - it tows our flat bed to get the chores done, our 24 ft trailer to play, a limo for arriving at our favorite dinner spot, plenty of room for our family, and looks great in our circle drive - it does it all. "American" got it right and Jeep does not go out of style! Gas, . . . I got such a good deal and my driving miles are very reasonable I am just fine. It drives fresh as the day I tested drove it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned 4 other jeeps all great! This one seems good so far except that "plastic key design known as Fobik " how long do you think it will last and replacement cost is $140.00 plus programing of $30.00 if you don't do it yourself. Whoever designed it should be sent to Ford or gm. Only other thing is seat backs to high making poor rear view.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you are in the market for an excellent all around vehicle. Do not hesitate to buy a commander. Shop around a little and you will not only get a great vehicle, but a bargain in the deal. Do not buy if you are wanting a 3o mpg vehicle. These weigh almost 5,500 lbs. But the plus side is how well they drive. Quiet, handles very well for its size. Acceleration with 5.7 hemi is awesome. Buy the hemi! This thing can accelerate from 50 to 100 in a heartbeat. And is just as quiet and confident at these speeds. The equipment included is awesome. The sound system ( Boston accoustics ) is audiophile quality. Go drive a limited or overland with a 5.7 hemi for about 100 miles. You will buy 1 maybe 2.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior quality and design. Excellent leather. My gig audio/video. Drives better than our 01 BMW 530is. And is much faster and quieter. Handles and stops excellent! More all around use than just a car. Very good looking and quality leather interior with rich wood and real metal accents.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This Jeep Commander Sports 4 x 4 3.7 engine is really a fun SUV to drive. Comfortable enough on a bumpy road and never could you hear any squeaking or rattle after a 3400 mileage accumulation. One problem is the backrest, it is too high for women with a height of 5-1/2 feet like my wife. The headrest is tilted downwards at it's maximum down level and very uncomfortable for her. Fuel consumption is 17 miles a gallon, a gas guzzler ha? Thank God gas is now $1.87/ gal. here in Chicago. No leaks or water accumulation on the doors as noted by previous 2007 Owners. The 3.7 6 cylinder is good enough for the size of the body. Third row seat? That's a plus for an outdoor sportsman like me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The computer-like menu browser on the dash, adjustable steering and the power seats on the driver side, how I wished they should have installed on the passenger side too for my Commander-in Chief. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've been a die hard Chevy pick-up guy and I still am, but I wanted a vehicle that was plush, comfortable, all the bells and whistles,but I wanted it as an Off road capable, as I spend alot of time afield, hunting, and I go into some very rough situations. This Jeep has out performed anything I've ever had and went everywhere the wranglers go except over huge rock, that I won't do as I want to keep this for awhile. But steep hills no matter the terrain, deep mud or snow this vehicle goes thru like it wasn't there, even places my P/U could never get thru. And I get there in comfort and quiet. By the way mine is the limited but I have the HEMI and all the bells and whistles. When we it is great</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>What a JEEP!!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Well, I have had my Jeep Army Green 08 Jeep Commander for about 8+ months now and am as happy today with my purchase as I was when I made it. I paid cash, got the lifetime power Trane and opted for the lifetime bumper to bumper since I had my last Grand Cherokee for 11 years I figured it would pay off. The Boston Acoustic stereo is fantastic. The sunroof and 2 additional sunroofs in the back seat area are cool, kids love them. A/C power in back seat helps out and heated leather seats are great looking and comfortable. When we go up the Pocono Mountains it very smartly shifts for steep inclines providing plenty of power with the 6 cyl. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We just purchased a new Jeep Commander. I had always driven a small luxury car. The SUV seems huge. To me it is like you took a Hummer and a Land Rover and combined the two. I absolutely love it. It is nice to look at. The interior is designed well. This is my first time to have cloth seats, but I love them. They are much better than leather if you ask me especially with the warranty for replacement if they become stained. I can not imagine a more perfect vehicle for a family. The third row seat has gotten some negative reviews, but not from me. I love it as well. It is perfect for kids who love to ride in the back.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The look of it. The spacious interior design. Drives like a dream. Ride is very smooth. Much nicer than a Tahoe or Explorer. Skylights for the second row. Large driving quarters. 3rd row seat when needed. Convenient for any lifestyle. Kids really love it Looks good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my 2006 Commander Ltd (HEMI) in for the 2008 Overland HEMI. It has all the bells and whistles so I don't see myself trading it in after 2 years like I always do. Got it with backseat TV. I've driven from NY to VA twice since August. I find that the gas mileage is close to the 4.0 and 4.7 engines that I've previously owned (Grand Cherokee). I arrive at the Maryland House (I95) with an 1/8 of a tank. Driving in the city and Long Island I do use more gas. I'm comfortable while driving. The only problem I had was an inefficient catalytic converter which my dealer replaced and no problems since. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MyGig system is great. The acceleration onto the highway is awesome. I can play music from my iPod, the hard drive or the Sirius sat radio. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This SUV is awesome!!! Sure, gas mileage isn't all that great, but who ever said you had to have great gas mileage to have a great car is stupid. For me, this car is great! It's just me in it most of the time, but I have many siblings and this helps me take them around when I'm taking care of them for a while. I average about 19 miles to the gallon so I think they new EPA estimates aren't accurate on that. Don't believe the numbers because that's driving the car like a stupid teen. If you drive responsibly, then you'll get about 16 in the city and about 23 on the freeway. Enjoy!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of head room. Lots of leg room. Lots of storage. I happen to love the rugged look. Reminds me of a Hummer kind of. This thing fits in my apartments parking spot, and that means it's just the right size width wise. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Since the initial purchase of the car May 2007, we have returned the Commander to the dealership 6 times due to the same issue. Leaking into driver and passenger floorboards which has now advanced to leaking into the dashboard. The dealership has worked really hard to try to remedy the issue, but to no avail. It is now September 2008 and we had another swimming pool in the car from rain over the weekend. The car is back in the shop. Oh, did I mention it was in the shop for the exact same thing last week. Sad to say this has really detracted from our enjoying the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased my Limited 4x4 w/HEMI in 2/08. Just turned 3,900 miles (>6 months later). Remember that, as it's a clue. Since purchase my brakes have gone out (entirely, while driving) and they replaced the Master Cylinder. The vehicle has totally died (engine and electrical) on numerous occasions (It is in the shop now getting its 3rd ignition system replacement). Beyond that, there have been numerous other electrical problems with the MyGig system and Navigation. To date the car has been at the dealer for 37 days (and counting) since I picked it up brand new a little over 6 months ago. Currently my attorney has written a demand letter to Chrysler for repurchase. It's a piece of junk!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I own a Jeep Commander 5.7 V8 Limited and try not to drive with the air conditioner on, for fuel economy. But, I've discovered how you can get cold air out, without using the compressor and still get good fuel economy. I have the dual control with a vent dial and fan speed dial. If you turn the right dial to auto and turn the fan speed to where ever want it, with the temperatures dials all the way down, you will get cool air out, but the air conditioner light doesn't come on. I think the dehumidifier is taking the moisture out of the air and pumping out cold air, without using the compressor. Give it a try and see what results you get. dr burke.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very impressed with my Jeep. It's fully loaded and roomy, for a single guy. It has a 5.7L Hemi with variable displacement engine. On the straight away, I drive on 4 cyl in 'power saver' mode and get 24 mpg @ 50 mph. I've found the sweet spot to be around 1500 rpm, if you aren't in a rush to get somewhere, it will increase your mpg by 5-10 mpg. I expect after more break in to average 26-28 mpg on regular gasoline. I am happy with my MDE. A few suggestions: When taking off, when you reach 25 mph, 'Resume' cruise control. And run on 1/2 fuel to increase mileage. Use Quaker+Slick50. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything. The way it slides over to the other lane, with no noticeable body motion and it's all where drive acceleration, leaves the dust behind when passing. I got the 'Let's refuel America' and hope the price of gas goes up to $6! Anything over $3 I get a credit back to me, so gas will be free!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Impressive. Always inspires other drivers. Envy. Gives you a safe, comfortable I'm in control feeling. Ok for married couples, but nix for kids. Plush! Right up their with a Caddy, but more beautiful and off road. Got the 'Lets refuel America' deal for $2.99 @ the pump for three years or 800 gallons for $2.99 per gallon, for a total of 2400 gallons. Deciding factor. No telling what gas is going to cost later this year or next and they credit you with the difference. Say $5 bucks at pump, you get $201 credited back to your credit card. Money in the bank. Oh, they have a May sale going on $2,000 + $1500 + Gas card, if you push and ask to see 'special' rebate for dealers, to give you</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks, the ride, the fun of driving a Jeep. I like the power saver indicator for Multi displacement engine. Put in cruise, 1500 rpm and go for fuel savings. Last hemi Jeep 25 mpg, this one 17, but still new and not broken in. Expect more. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have the 2008 Rocky Mountain package. It has the 3.7 V6, it's a little underpowered, but it's not too bad on mpg. On the highway it gets about 20 mpg and in the city 15. The one thing that I don't like about it is if it rained and there is still some water on the roof and you open the windows the water pours into the truck. It's even worse when you hit the brakes it just pours all over the inside. Thats the only thing I can say is an issue. Everything else is great, rides like a caddy, and is really roomy.</TEXT>

I had a Toyota 4 runner before that did not get good gas mileage. It is flexifuel so i can put ethanol (e85) gas in it; that was a bonus for me along with everything else it had to offer.

<TEXT>Overall I love the Commander. I have 4x4 Limited with the Hemi. I live in the city so I only average 9.2 mpg but that's ok, my commute is only 1.8 miles. On its one and only expressway trip (60 miles) I average 17.2 mpg - which is more than the EPA rating so I'm good. There is only one issue I have with it. I've never seen a factory sunroof that doesn't have a pop-up wind deflector. It's impossible to drive with the sunroof open over 25 mph. Am I going to have to go buy an external one?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our Commander is a replacement to 2 previous Grand Cherokees and a Cherokee. We've been a Jeep family for many years and love the feel and drive of Jeep products. This one surpasses all others. It rides high with excellent front visibility and the seats are very comfy. The engine (4.7) gets about 13 mpg around town and about 19 on the road(not bad for a V8!) and has lots of power. The side air bags are a great safety feature. We heard the Commander might be eliminated in 2009. This would be a huge mistake, as this is the only full size (7 passenger) SUV that Jeep offers and is competitive with most larger family type SUV's. Also it is one of the few full size SUV's that is offroad capable.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Mygig entertainment system, which was free, is awesome.

<TEXT>Going from a Toyota to a Jeep makes me realize how far Chrysler still has to go. The Jeep has been reliable and steady through the first 2000 miles but uninpressive.In reality, this vehicle should have seating for five not seven. It's just not big enough and because of this the ergonomics of the interior suffer.Instead of competing directly with the Grand Cherokee, I don't understand why jeep wouldn't ditch the Durango/Aspen and make this their full size vehicle and make it world class. </TEXT>

It is unique looking, not like all those crossbreeds currently flooding the market... It is fast and powerfull I doesnt do to well with gas mileage, but what to you expect with a vehicle that is around 6k lbs? With a huge 8 in it? It has 330+ HP and always in 4.. I have been driving around looking for piles to drive this thing over.... It has so much power that nothing is intimidating. The electronics a cool.. nav, rear monitor, sensors, automatic window sensors.....etc I would buy it again</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased a Limited model with every option. Kids love the Sirius backseat TV. MyGIG Nav with VES is simply fabulous. QuadraDrive II makes driving in 10 inches of snow a breeze. Build quality is top notch and overall this Jeep feels solid. Backup camera is very useful in this vehicle as rear visibility is compromised with 3rd row seat up. Too many useful options to name...UConnect bluetooth, Smartbeam headlights, hill ascent and descent assist, ESP, traction control, rear sky windows, etc. If you are looking for a great SUV with tons of options for a fair price and not sacrifice quality...I strongly recommend the Jeep Commander.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a brand new 2008 Jeep Commander Limited, with everything... nav. system, commandview, power liftgate... everything, except the 5.7L Hemi, of which I am proud to say I don't have. I average around 14mpg with an occasional "floor it" moment. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 4.7L V8- very capable. The driver's seat- when it's accended I feel very in control of this 5,000lb SUV. I'm head over heals about the power liftgate, partly because I'm lazy, and partly because every time I let it do its thing there is always someone with a dropped jaw.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the Commander. I spend about 2 hours a day commuting in this vehicle and it could not be more fun and comfortable to drive! The rear cargo area could be a little more spacious but it works great for what I need. The Commander is so rich looking, inside and out and everyone who gets in it is very impressed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The styling, both interior and exterior.</FAVORITE>
