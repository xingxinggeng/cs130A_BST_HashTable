<TEXT>Bought this vehicle with 18K mi. on it. It was great for about 2 days. That's when the front brakes went out (Pad's worn out- completely gone). I found out the rear brake pads had been replaced right before I bought it and rear rotors seriously grooved. Then the passenger sliding door broke... Van drove pretty well then except for a clunking gear shift sometimes between 2cd and 3rd around 20 mph. No real other problems until one night at 30K mi. when it just didn't start. I tried both keys- nothing. Had it towed to dealer- no codes, no answers....no confidence. Traded in for new Chevy Tahoe. Happy to have it gone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>scary moment when 3 weeks ago the back up camera, A/C & heating vents, radio, speedometer & other dash reading disappear & nothing worked, along with power windows, power door locks. 43000km on this baby & under warranty, took to the dealer shop, they refused to look into because I wasn't having an issue now, but they did do the upgrades on computer for free (which they apparently charge for),also have chronic problems of locking the van, I have to push down on the button 3 or 4 times & had it check out but they never find anything wrong. it's been great, no problems otherwise, love all the features, rear seats uncomfortable. Great for camping, can easily sleep 2 adults comfortably.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>back up camera, hard drive with usb-photos, all the outlet plugs & 115 v, great ride, smooth & easy to handle, love the stow & Go & all the storage & cargo area, never have to carry or remove a seat ever again. I owned the 98 caravan & bought the '08 because of realiability & versatile capability</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a Dodge Grand Caravan that I purchased there less than a year before with brake noise. My wife complained on previous occasions but was told nothing was wrong. When they finally looked at it vehicle was out of warranty period and they said the repair would not be covered. It cost us $471.98 to replace front and back pads and resurface rotors. Was not informed that a TSB #05-006-08 had been issued. Part number recommended in TSB does not match part number on my invoice. Now they need replaced again a year later because they were making a squealing noise and overheating. When I took it in to a local mechanic, he said my left rear caliper is leaking and needs to be replaced. No calipers</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought it from dealer new with 839 miles on it. I researched minivans to no end before I bought this one, and one thing that bothers me about it is the people that whine about issues that are either routine maintenance or abuse! The brake problems are caused by heavy footed stooges riding the brakes and the sliding door problems are from lack of lubrication! Use some common sense and maintain your vehicle! The only issue I've had is the A/C blows warm in the South Carolina heat until you get moving. I've checked the system myself and guess what...that's normal for a vehicle with a cabin this big! Overall I like the vehicle, the kid loves the DVDs and the wife won't let me drive it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sturdy feeling vehicle, loaded with conveniences, Absolutely love the MyGig System, and the interior lighting is terrific! I'd like to say it was worth the money, but this sucker tailspun by about 9 grand the second I signed the papers for it, and I got it for a good price new..according to Edmunds</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased the vehicle brand new from dealership. At 18k started hearing screeching noise from front tires. Outcome? Complete brake overhaul from calipers, rotors and brake pads, all needed replaced. Dealership said there was no reported issue even though I showed them pages and pages of customer complaints about the brakes. I did this out of my own pocket for the safety of my family. Now before warranty expires the transmission is slipping. We took to dealer said there was a recall and fixed right? Wrong? Today wife had to take back to dealer, $95 bucks to look at it since no longer under warranty. Rental out of my pocket and the outcome is still TBD...... Terrible experience.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought car for carting 2 kids and wife to do home health care. Did OK in snow but all wheel drive would do better.Has left my wife stranded 3 times in 8 months. Car stuck in Park and the 3rd time the tow truck could not make the manual over ride work, so had to get dolly wheels to get it to the dealer. Front passenger seat needs to have same adjustments as drivers seat. Can not go up and down. Back seats to low. Hard for older people to get in and out.

<TEXT>It's an 08, but had been sitting on lot for a year (500 miles). Why? I guess 'cause it's LOADED with everything EXCEPT leather. And "sunburst orange pearlcoat," which is to say "rust" colored. Anyway, they took $10K off the sticker. It's a 4.0 L. Funny how the '08 4L's don't have the 25 MPG rating that the '09 4L's do. How did Chrysler squeeze 2 more MPG out of the same engine in '09? Dealer doesn't even know what I'm talking about, or pretends not to. But love the acceleration. Alas, I'm getting 15 MPG in town. And in the 6 wks I've owned it, this has happened 4 times: engine starts but no lights or A/C. Jiggle the key, and it all comes back on, but A/C blows HOT AIR for 5 min!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had our 2008 dodge grand caravan for 6 months now. I will have to say we are disappointed with the interior quality of the van. It rides nice and looks great for the design, but Chrysler just did not focus on the details. I will have to say for a van that now has 350000 miles on it, it sure has a lot of interior rattles with the cheap plastic hardware everywhere on the dash and center overhead console. Secondly,when going over rougher roads the rear suspension chatters a lot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wife's van w/ 3 kids. Power side and rear doors are great when they shut. Drivers side door will not shut all the time. Been into the dealership for this and for a broken latch on the lid for front stow n go seat. Original brakes (17,000+ miles), original tires. Have hauled 1000# of lumber, inside, and about 1000# of landscape edging bricks. No damage to inside seats when down. Handles great in the Michigan winters (above average last year). Van is driven mainly city driving, but weekend trips are over 50 miles, one way. Just got back from a 240 mile round tripper yesterday. Averaged 23-24 mpg on turnpike. Very pleased. Seats, at head rests, seem to be coming apart, though.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stow n go. In floor storage, w/ seats up. Power doors (opening). Power, stability, amount of cup holders, one-touch up driver side window. Siding doors have power windows that go down. Roof Rack a must. Like the radio controls on backside of steering wheel. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My family has had Grand Caravans since 1998. Loved them up until the 2008 Grand Caravan. It is a nice car to drive and comfortable but too many problems. Here are the problems: antifreeze leak when purchased new-- took 2 repairs, roof rack bars in wrong position and on backwards, have had 1 shock replaced, 1 strut replaced, front brakes and rotors at 29,000 mi, back electrical "cage" in ceiling loose, rear bumper pad replaced, still squeaks when going over bumps, wind whistling noise, doors don't always open when pushing automatic key fob. Plan to trade for an SUV as soon as I can. Cannot believe this is a $31,000 car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan for 18mo. I've been without my van for over ten weeks because of multiple problems. In fact it has been in the shop for over seven weeks because they cannot find parts to repair the transmission that has gone out for the second time. Great quality Dodge! Do yourself a favor and never look at a dodge or chrysler product ever. Oh yea, its not their fault that they cannot get the parts to repair my van. It's the suppliers fault. They probably won't make them for dodge anymore because they were just screwed by them with the recent bankrupcy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been around the block with minivans over 15 years and wagons before that. This is the best one I have owned, and I really liked the previous G Caravan and the T & C before this. Decent driving, good comfort, good power (3.8 engine), and no problems at 29000 miles. Best mpg I've had (25 hiway, 19-20 town), and I love the Stow and Go. I don't know what the "professional reviewers are looking for in a mini, but this has everything I look for. And it has more usable space than any other. That's what led me to the Chrysler T&C in '94. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We just bought this brand new, yes 2008 we purchased in June 2009 with 50 miles on it. We drove 500 miles on vacation and the engine (power train) blew while on expressway going 65 miles/hr. We've owned the van for 2 weeks to the day. Of course, the dealership was closed in the town we were in...bottom line we had to rent a van for $120/day for our family of 6. We will be reimbused a whole $375 for "trip interruption insurance". However, we are now home withOUT our "new" broken van. It's 500 miles away waiting for a "part" that isn't due for 5 more days. Once the van it fixed we have to find a way to our vehicle and pick it up. We will NEVER buy another Dodge, ever!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great Van so far other than the front brakes which i had to replace at 8000 miles.Poor quality. Thankfully it was covered under warranty in it's first year and dealer replaced it at no charge and they gave me another year coverage. Van has everything you need for the family at a great price. Too bad Honda and Toyota are not competitive enough for features and price. From experience in ownership,they are not reliable vehicles.</TEXT>

<TEXT> We have been happy with this van since we purchased it. The ride is verry good but it does pull to the right ever so slightly and the brakes his when it is wet out. But the the gas mileage is pretty good 18/27 and the room is great. I have 4 kids 3,2, 1 and 2 weeks old and we are verry comfortable in this van. Stow and go is awsome and the power sliding door Windows are Nice. I do wish the acceleration was a bit more aggressive but it is adequate. Over all you get what you pay for. Not everyone will get a good vehicle, no auto maker is perfect. I chose a Dodge and got a good vehicle. So with so many of these vans on the road a few of them are bound to have problems. But most caravans don't.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought a van that the owner's wife of the dealership drove with aprox 6,000 miles on it. It has been in the shop for replacement sensor for the door, AC would shut off so they replaced internal thermostat, sensor that would tell us outside temp was replaced, front passenger seat belt unreliable and arm rest fell off and was replaced, 2 tires replaced and the icing on the cake we needed to replace the brakes at 22,000 miles.I was told by the dealer that they have been replacing alot of the breaks on this car. What really is disgusting is that they want you to pay to replace the crappy brakes that they put in. I am sorry to say that I will be buying my first foreign made car in the fall. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had nothing but problems. First, I had the radio replaced and now I am experiencing ghost like things you would find on TV. First the heat would just go off on its own, then the DVD player stopped working and said region not set (whatever that means) and now I just got home and on my way home in the dark, my headlights went completely out. This was very scary because I know it cannot be the battery cause it was only the headlights that went out. I am really fed up with this company. I could have been in a serious accident due to this failure. I am now afraid to drive the van with my kids in it. I bought it a year ago brand new, so why all this fuss? </TEXT>

<TEXT>My first Dodge van was a 1884 model, and this is my 4th since then. Although I've like all my vans, this one is head and shoulders above the others. The build quality is good, but even more the ride and handling is far superior. I guess this is the Mercedes influence on the design. The seating position and comfort are excellent. A power seat helps here. The controls fall readily to hand, are very intuitive, and have a quality feel. Outward vision at first seemed blocked by thick pillars but I find I got used to that quickly and am not bothered now. I find that parking is far easier than with my old vans. The square corners may help here but the steering seems more precise as well. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quality feel of interior finish and controls. Defrost in our Canadian winters works great. The gear shift over-ride on my 4-speed is excellent for passing and entering freeways. Two quick pulls to the left and second gear is good for 115 kph (72 mph) without straining the engine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Lots of problems with this Van right out of the gate. We were having transmission problems that none of the dealerships believed were real. Until about 300 miles before the warranty was up. Then they had to replace the gears in the transmission and a bunch of other stuff. Then little problems. The grab handle on the passenger side became loose, the map lights stopped working, the driver door speakers are blown. This is the second and last Dodge / Chrysler product I will ever buy. I don't care how cheap they sell them for. I guess you get what you pay for.</TEXT>

Great in the snow. Too much white inside for sure. This is a basic cheap people mover. The wind noise is bad at times, and does pull to the right. I adjusted my tires to correct this.

Was told I am not the only one having that problem, Dodge came out with an upgrade kit that I had to buy for $400 to correct problem 5) two tires replaced (bad and cheap tires in my opinion). 6) radio had a bug, had to download upgraded software to fix 7) turn signals stay on unless you jiggle the handle couple of times.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our van fully loaded back in March 08. It has everything, 4.0L engine, the works. Overall, it's a really nice vehicle. However; we have had nothing but problems with this vehicle. As of Jan 10th 09 we've had this vehicle in to have the thermostat replaced 8 times. It's been declared a lemon. The transmission has started leaking fluid, the sliding doors do what they want to. It looses heat from time to time. The remote start works when it wants to. We went to trade this vehicle in for something else and it has depreciated value by $22,000. I almost fainted. We bought the van for $36,000 and I tried to trade it in, and was offered $14,000. Buyers beware.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>As far as features, it's a really nice vehicle. We love the sliding doors (when functional). The folding 3rd row seats are cool.

<TEXT>We purchased this car six months ago and have had nothing but trouble with it. Within the first two weeks we had trouble with the radio, as it would shut off on its own for no reason. It eventually had to be replaced, which took us 3 visits to accomplish. Since then we've had a knock in the steering wheel (3 visits), a rattle in the driver's door, and currently our anti-lock brake / stabilization light is on. I have 3 kids in carseats and bought this van for the conveniences it was supposed to offer - it has been an absolute pain for us, as there is no convenience associated with taking a car in every other week.

<TEXT>Bought this van with 6800 miles on it. Had it about 8 days and the check engine light came on. Dealer said that I had water in my gas so put in a gas treatment and a spark plug. The check engine light came on before I got home so took it back and dealer said the injector was bad so changed it. Drove 2 days and the check engine light came back on so dealer kept it for 2 days and said that the injector wasn't seating properly because of deposit builup. They now want to "pull the head and see what's going on in side". So, runs bad, poor mileage, check engine light on, starter doesn't engage on cold mornings and now heater randomly blows ice cold air.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th Dodge minivan, we love it. The new front styling is why I bought it. Just got back from Washington St. over 1,600 mi. one way with no problems. We hit a 60 mi head wind and mileage drop to 20 mpg. The rest of the trip we made 30 mpg. couldn't be happier. 3400 mi on less than $280.00 in gas. Only thing I didn't like is it always shifting down going up the mountains ranges,and little hills. lack of power unless it shifted down and than the motor sound like it was going to blow up. My wife, daughter, and 2 grands kids made the trip and we had plenty of room thanks to the stow and go. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Replaced a 2001 Oddysey with only 88,000 miles; needed a new tranny, power door motor, water pump, EGR valve, brake drums (again) Our Grand Caravan drives nicer than the Honda did when it was new. I drive it whenever I can (my wife never wants to part with it). 2,500 miles and not a single problem. The van feels solid and safe, great acceleration; bumps do not intrude into the cabin, yet it handles great. Plastics are not sub-standard; they're designed to handle "kid-abuse", which they do. If you are the market for a minivan, do not overlook this awesome vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This van is always in the shop for repair! It's had 7 service visits in 11 months: 1) The ignition key receiver failed, resulting in a tow the 1st month. 2&3) Hard drive on stereo was replaced twice. Chrysler also sent out software upgrade to fix add'l problems with system. 4) Tail gate assembly latch was replaced when it locked shut and I couldn't even open it manually. 5) Side sliding doors, which never shut properly electronically, had to be adjusted. 6 & 7) The heater in one of the seats quit working, so had to replace the heating element. In addition, indicator lights are unreliable. Recommendation: Don't buy this vehicle! We spent $30,000, and wish we had our old van (worth $1,000).</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far so good. I love the fold flat seats. Extremely versatile. I opted to not get the myGig, just kept in simple. With a lifetime powertrain warranty, keeping it simple makes sense. We'll keep this van for 10 years. I am very tall and the flexibility of the pedal positions, and lack of an obtrusive center console made the Grand Caravan my choice over Honda and Toyota. I drive less than 7,500 years and my 1998 BMW 528i was costing $2,500 in annual repairs to achieve this meager goal. The Caravan is fantastic economy and reliability by comparison.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had nothing but problems with my 2008 Grand Caravan since I got it in Jan. 2008. It has had a new exhaust put on it. The sliding door on the driver's side has been worked on 2 times because it starts to close and then re-opens. That still is not working 100% of the time. The keypad does not work at all when it is near my husband's Tahoe either in the garage or in a store parking lot. Now it beeps at me when I am driving, the lights on the dash all turn on, the RPM and MPH go to 0 & the windshield wipers turn on. I bought it for convenience since I have 3 kids & when the doors don't work or I have to stand there and make sure the doors shut it is anything but convenient.</TEXT>

Starts with blower speed control working inconsistently, then dash lights go on or off or light up like a Christmas tree and the vehicle may stall. Going back to the dealer tomorrow. Still have my 95 CaravanSE, love it-hoped the 08 would be the same. Afraid to drive the 08. Also a bit of a whistle under the hood. Body "dings" easily, thin sheet metal?

<TEXT>Let me start by saying, I like the van and this is my second one. But the new design has a whistling sound when doing 65-70 MPH. The problem is around the windshield on the unit, Between the window and the pillar that extends to the roof. The rubber insert is not long enough and it causes a whistle sound. You will need to tape the outside until you can run a thin bead of caulk under the rubber to prevent the wind from getting in. I do a lot of driving in a year (42,000 annually) and I currently have it taped and it has stopped the noise. Good luck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my van. We do not have any of the problems that others have mentioned (whistling noise, road noise, poor visibility with dual screens, etc.) The controls are nicely laid out. Love the Uconnect, mygig, and the 6 speed transmission. I live on top of a hill, and rather than riding my brakes all the way down, I just downshift and let the engine do the work. We also love the piece of mind of the lifetime powertrain warranty (we added the lifetime wrap that covers just about everything else for $2700) For under 30k we have tons of features, people / cargo space, power, and safety, with the piece of mind that comes with only having to pay for basic maintenance. We think we got a bargain.</TEXT>

<TEXT>While parked and unoccupied, the van shifted out of park on its own and coasted down into another parked car. Chrysler sent an inspector out who couldn't find anything wrong. They won't repair damage done to van in collision. They act like it never happened. Beware 08 van owners! Always set emergency brake when parked. Chrysler's customer service is not very impressive.

<TEXT>Second Dodge vehicle I've purchased. I love the new Dodge Grand Caravan! The entertainment system is unsurpassed, with the MyGig System and the rear dual overhead DVD screens. The exterior styling is more masculine than the competition. 2nd and 3rd rows both still fold underneath, a great feature. Limited lifetime warranty on the powertrain for the original owner is priceless. Was about $3,000 to $4,000 less expensive than the Odyssey and Sienna for a comparably equipped vehicle, but those two can't touch the entertainment system. My wife and I fight over who gets to drive it. Thus far, we love the Caravan!</TEXT>

But now (in June '08) we have a whistling problem that the dealership can't seem to figure out. Over 65 mph and the van sings a tune. Van been in shop twice and we are still waiting for problem to be fixed. If we can get rid of this problem, I am sure I will LOVE my new van. Hate the position of the video screens, wish they were off center somehow. Backup camera is nice, but please still turn and look, camera is deceiving. Overall very happy with van, just need to get the whistling to stop. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I will be honest: I find the new look of the 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan to be ugly. It looks like a box from the rear and an SUV in the front. Gas mileage is OK, cabin noise high, and the heat/AC nodules hard to operate. The front bumper cracked when I drove in single digits over the winter, cracking the bumper. Ice had stuck to the inside of the bumper and when the ice melted, it dropped, cracking the bumper. The Paint is also cheap. My one good kudo is the cargo space. I use this van for car-camps when I drive long-distance on weekends to attend road races, and crashing in the back with the seats stowed away is great. I wish I could love this vehicle, though. It's so ugly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a 2008 Grand Caravan SE in February. I took it on its first road trip over Easter. The comfort was great but the road noise was horrid. You have to have the radio at the #16 volume to hear it. This could have been improved for a few dollars more by Chrysler. The gas mileage is awful! With gas over $3/gallon and maybe $4 by summer it will cost me over $300.00/month (another car payment). Chrysler could have built a more efficient engine than this one. If this keeps up, I will be forced to get rid of it this year. I have two kids which require car seats so unfortunately, I need something bigger than a car.

<TEXT>We leased this vehicle in anticipation of buying something similar. I spent 3000 miles in it over 1 week and overall have a favorable opinion. The engine had adequate power and the van handled well. There was a little more wind noise that I would have liked and it made listening to the poor quality radio difficult (suggest upgrading from the base radio). The gas mileage was OK for a vehicle this size and in this category. I averaged about 22mph with about 80% of the driving interstate. I did not like the keyless entry. Everytime you locked the doors the horn beeped and the lights blinked. I am sure I annoyed a few people at the motel when we arrived about 11pm.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Only driven about 1000 miles so far I love the my gig, though I am just getting used to the operation. The drive is solid, with solid steering and decent brakes. I did get the 4.0 engine, and compared to the 3.8, it was well worth it. very easy to pass on the highway, and sporty in town, more than any minivan has the right to. Some of the electronic automation (tri zone temp) is not yet intuitive, but is becoming less obtrusive, (who reads the manual anyway?) Only problem we had so far was the my gig would cut out over every bump in the road. Easy fix-loose fuse. A lot of storage space, loads of floor space.

<TEXT>My initial review of the van we just took delivery of. I will update this as time goes on... First off, this is one substantial "mini"van. Its big, inside and out. Its quiet on the road, the 4.0L engine puts out plenty of grunt when coupled with the 6 speed auto transmission. The ability to manually shift the transmission might have some actual uses out there, but for me, its just there to make dad feel like he's driving something a bit more sporty. There are so many features available for this van its impossible to list in this space, however, we got every feature we could except the 9 speaker system and power fold rear seat. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4.0L engine and 6-speed transmission. Dual screens with seperate sources. Sirius backseat TV is a super value. Window shades in both rows. A place for everything.

<TEXT>My reference point is my previous 2006 Town & Country. The 2008 Dodge Caravan certainly includes lots of nice features I didn't have in my previous van. Such as the dual DVD system, shades on second and third row windows (optional) and a more ergonomic interior, in general. So far my major complaint is about the quality of the assembly/manufacturing of the body panels. I had a huge gap between the panels of the driver's side doors and the front door (driver's side) has to be slamed or it won't close. After three visits to the dealer the problem has not been fully fixed. The latch system has been replaced and several adjustments have been made. The gap is gone but I still have to slam the door</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first Dodge Caravan, previously owned three Chrysler T&C. Local dealer only sells Dodge. We wanted the stow-n-go seats which suits our constant hauling items to our kids who live out of state, all three in three different states. After unloading we simply fold up seats to haul parents and child seats. We are very happy with the new exterior styling and interior creature comforts - heated seats, adjustable pedals, rear camera, second windows that open! Very comfortable for highway driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats, adjustable pedals, Sirius radio, 3.8 engine, auto headlights, hands free communication.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Present mileage just shy of 4000. Gas mileage city 15 and 24 highway. Best ride of any mini-van I have driven. Wish I had paid a few dollars more and got the SXT. Traded in a 2007 Mercury Milan that I really liked, but this mini is a whole lot more vehicle and gets almost the same gas mileage</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling and the ride. That's what its all about.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At first glance, it's a lot of van for the money. I was most impressed with the Entertainment option. However, I had the van for 3 days and returned it. In 3 days of driving, the 3rd row video screen stopped working 2x, the pass sliding door would not close 5x (closed, then opened), overhead console rattles, remote for the DVD didn't work, music copy function didn't work on the radio, and the exterior panels are not even. Look at the gap between the hood and fenders. This van has a lot of nice features - a lot of features that will keep you coming in for service of intermittent problems Also, the van w swivel seats is not crash test rated, but others are 5 star. HMMMM</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ability to play 2 DVD's simulataneously and listen to the radio. Ability to purchase the entertainment system without purchasing all the options you don;t want. Backup camera.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Our first chrysler</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>This is our first minivan and our first Chrysler/Dodge vehicle. We had looked at the other makes and models and found that the Dodge Caravan and it's counterpart are by far the best minivans around. Very sharp vehicle. I have had it only one week and absolutely love it! We have two small children with a third on the way, and it is very comfortable and fun to drive. (SXT, 4.0L 255 hp, 28N package with NAV) Awesome! My next car will likely be a Chrysler product - They have thoroughly impressed me. I went from a Volvo S60R to a minivan, and I don't miss my Volvo sports car at all! I never thought that a minivan could be fun.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Standard lifetime powertrain warranty, Entertainment features/options, great looks, comfort, swivel and go, power doors and lift gate, DVDs, etc. No minivan stigma. Rearview camera.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought this van and I am impressed already. This redesigned 08 looks sharp and has all the features you could want without the mark-ups you get from Honda and the other guys. We got the 28N package which puts you into the 4.0L V- 6 at 255hp (Plenty of power on the highway plus more than all of the competition). Inside is great with two DVD screens and the swivel and go seating. Power doors and lift gate make this grocery getter easy to love. Dads don't worry about the minivan stigma because this thing looks and drives great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Redesigned look, 255hp V-6, rear DVD system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a very sharp minivan. I've had it for a week so far and my wife and I love it! I?m not impressed too much with the acceleration too much when passing, but the engine still has to break in. I researched the 0 to60 for this van and it was over 10sec</TEXT>
