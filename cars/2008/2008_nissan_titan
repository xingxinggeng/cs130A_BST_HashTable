<TEXT> I have owned this truck since new and it has been one of the best trucks I have ever had. I have never had a problem with it. I had a 04 titan and it was a good but I wanted a longer bed. I did have some problems with the 04 such as the brakes witch dealer fixed. As for my 2008 its been a great truck. I pulled a trailer all over for the first year I had it and I had no trouble at all. I got 10 to 12 mpg towing the trailer witch is better than my chev with a 454 that got 6 to 9 mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE> I really like all the features I have with the Titan. DVD, Rockford fosgate radio with satelite. 8 way powered and heated seats plus the way the rear seats fold up. Plus the storage box at the back. Also the easy lift tail gate. And the power rear window. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my titan! I have owned it for a year now, and it's still running like new! It has tons of power, and will eat most American trucks off the line. Traveled from MS to OK to TX and back and wasn't fatigued at all, very comfortable ride. I have eased off the gas pedal alittle and usually get around 15-16 city, and 18-19 hwy. I have towed boats, trailers with no problems what so ever. All in all the only thing I would've changed would be to get the 4x4 model for when I go up to MN in the snowy winters that's all. Great Truck at a better price than you'll find at the competitors! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Had mine for 17 months. Great truck as the tile says. Fuel mileage isn't great but with the engine this thing has I am not surprised. This thing with a trailer will walk off from any Ford I have owned or driven and I have had nothing but Fords for the last 30 years until now. Drove a new 2009 F150 and it still doesn't compare. I have had no issues whatsoever and am very happy with the truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one "great" truck, hands down. You have the feel of complete control with this truck. The performance reminds me of the 1970 Pontiac Grand Prix I once owned. Runs like a "scalded" dog.

<TEXT>I traded a Chevrolet Silverado for my Titan and the difference is night and day. I have a big V-8 and I get equal mileage as my chevy with the v-6. The unique styling takes a lot to get used to. I like how the seats are higher which gives a better view of the road and put that with the massive glass, it is like riding around in a glass car. The fuel mileage is absolutely terrible, but I put the recommended amount of MOTORKOTE in the crankcase and it increased the mileage form 13 to 14.5. The thing rides fantastic as well. very smooth. The stock stereo with 6 speakers sounds great. Seats are big, which is good for me because I am a big dude. I have had for 6 months and still can't park it very</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, have now 7000 miles on truck and once again all I can say is amazing truck. This truck is truly an outstanding truck. The truck preforms way past my expectations as it totally outperforms everything out there. If you want a great truck get one. My gas mileage is good for a big truck, and quick.. no one can keep up. Nissan needs to upgrade exterior design as this is the 4th year with same design, but otherwise couldn't be happier. Ride is exceptional, looks outstanding and the LE options are fantastic. If you don't consider one you have made a big mistake.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Truck is a 2008.5 that I use for daily driving and towing a 4000+ LB boat around. I was comparing this truck to the 1/2 ton GMC and Tundra but I picked the Nissan after test driving all 3 because of the Titan's interior and exterior looks and feel. The leather seats look to be very high quality plus the dash controls and gauges are more modern looking, well placed, and practical. The performance of this truck will put a smile on your face anytime you feel the need. Gas mileage is not great but I knew that when I bought this truck. The only problems I had or have is that the rear underseat storage container squeaks and the tire pressure alarm lit up and would not reset until 40psi was used.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought a 2008 Nissan Titan fully loaded except the nav/entertainment system. We got the nice Pebble Beach colour. Over-all we are happy with the truck, plenty of power, handles nicely, luxury interior, awesome sound system (Rockford Fosgate), rides better than a Chev although it mainly has to do with the great seats (the truck has a much more heavy duty suspension and chassis set-up), and has very unique and handy features. We although had two VERY minor issues with the truck at 20,000km. The stereo twice now stopped producing sound but was on, and was fixed by turning the truck off and restarting it. The second issue is the Tire Pressure Sensor Light is on although the tires are fine!?</TEXT>

<TEXT>It is a 08.5, just turned 12000 miles and not a problem. I looked at all the options out there, Toyota, Ford, and Chevy. Toyota was my #1 choice but to get a crew cab you only got a 5.5 ft bed what would you do with that. I looked and compared trucks for six months. I never considered the Nissan until my wife took me over to the dealer and I have yet to look back. I Like It. It has all the options and some. I drive 60% Highway and 40% everything else. I am averaging 15 to 16.5 mpg. The 7 ft bed is great, room for all the gear, ATV, and the deer. The only thing I did not like, it is hard to find an off road friendly tire in the 20in rim with out putting on a lift.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of room, the LE options. Rear seat folds up and down, Rockford Fosgate, blue tooth, sun roof, the 7 foot bed, and the rumble of the factory exhaust no need to buy an aftermarket it sounds good stock.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded a 2005 Silverado Crew Cab for the Nissan, and have been very pleased so far. Excellent power and smooth shifts. Hauls wife & kids like a full- size car, but carries anything you can throw in the back or hook to the hitch. Very comfortable seats and roomy cab with great options. Would prefer an auto 4WD mode and a Neutral on the transfer case, as well as mechanical anit-spin differentials instead of the brake system. Love the R-F sound system and the DVD entertainment. Could do without the 20" rims and low-profile tires as I prefer capability over bling. Have had a couple minor issues, but I've had that with every truck I've ever owned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It is an 08.5, I looked at all the others and was set on the Toyota, but the full crew cab had a poor 5.5 foot bed. What would you do with that? So my wife pointed me to look at the Nissan, and I have yet to look back, it has just turned 12000 miles, and I Like It, the fuel mileage is good between 15 and 17, 60% highway. I lost 3 mpg from my old Toyota Tacoma but gained so much more load and towing ability. With the LB there is room for the ATV, gear, and the Deer. The LE is great too and all the comforts someone could ask for. Good job Nissan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We found a Titan with 3600 miles on it & traded in a 2000 Chevy Tahoe. The Titan has been such a nice surprise for us. We tow a 6000lb RV and it blows our old Tahoe away with its towing capability. Smooth transmission and even better fuel mileage while towing vs. the Tahoe. As far as fuel economy goes, that too has been a pleasant surprise. We're getting about 15 to 15.5mpg in town driving. You have to keep your foot out of it for sure. Its actually a little better on fuel mileage than the Tahoe. I love the interior design & feel its definitely an improvement over the Tahoe workmanship. Smooth ride. Only downside is it is loud! I had the dealer switch out exhaust systems. All around we love this truck!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior is comfortable. Handling and ride are very enjoyable. Great towing ability. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I live in Anchorage Alaska, so I wanted a nice 4wd vehicle that I could pull my toys with and take people along as well. The Titan has been everything I could have ever wanted it to but, until recently, I don't know if it's the harsh temperature or just a flaw from Nissan, but I've taken it back to the dealership 2x and still the axle squeaks every time I brake or just drive under 10mph. Other than that it's awesome!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>LOTS OF ROOM!!! You can seat belt 6 people inside, but you can easily fit 10 (tried and true). Took it up and down a mountain, couldn't ask for anything more. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Did my homework. I love my Titan with a couple of exceptions. Soon after purchase, it felt like there was a role of quarters in the left side of my seat cushion. To their credit, dealer replaced seat. However, seat is still uncomfortable (should have got the leather I suppose). Also, the truck has no outside temp gauge - I can't believe it. Dealer is no help and emails and calls to Nissan net no response at all. As a result, I will never buy another Nissan product. Other than that, I really do like everything else about this truck. But alas, I hear Nissan is giving up after their first try. I wonder where the Tundra would be if Toyota gave up after just one shot at it?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking to buy another Sierra until I sat in a Titan at the Auto Show. This truck has the most comfortable seating of any vehicle I have ever sat in as well as a ton of leg room (important for me as I have long legs). I tow an 18' fiberglass boat that is kind of heavy and this truck pulls it very well. The nav system is excellent and a nice option to have. It was hard to find one with side air bags as the package for air bags includes an electronic stability system - both of which I feel should be standard on all vehicles. Gauges are well designed and easy to read. The transmission temp gauge is nice to have if you are towing anything.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Titan. Lease trucks through business. First Titan was awesome as not one bit of trouble, trouble was couldn't keep out of it as I always loved driving it. Was never thinking of changing to another truck, but after rethinking the lease options again and seeing I was over mileage I looked at others, but kept coming back to Titan. Love the quality, performance and overall satisfaction of my older 2005 titan. This new one is awesome. Great performance. Great sound system and just a good truck. Have only had it a week, but can tell you the quality is there, and the service from our local dealership is great. I'm sure I'll have more to write but so far this is another great truck</TEXT>

<TEXT>It has a shake, wobble that is at times down right scary. It's always there but sometimes it's light and sometimes it will shake the steering wheel out of your hands. I will never own another. Also, the front end shakes and shimmies when I hit a hole, like it was worn out and I have 16,000 miles on it. I'm scared to take it on a trip. I've owned Dodge, Ford, Chevy trucks and I would take any of them over this Titan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an amazing truck. It truly outperforms the competition in every aspect... except gas mileage. The wife wants me to sell it because of the 13city-17hwy MPG stats. Aftermarket bolt-ons only help a little. Maybe with a smaller V-8 engine package you could set up your application the way you need. I hear the bed squeak when I have the back window down. There have been absolutely no problems with my Titan, I love it, and it has the most get up and go out of all the trucks I have tested. Buy it if you can afford the gas. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Best feature by far is the 6 disc CD changer/aux input for the iPod. Heated seats, and mirrors are good too. The seats are comfortable, yet durable. My Titan glows after a good wax.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What attracted us to this car was that it is the only 1/2 ton pickup with a full size cab and long bed. This configuration is awesome! The cabin is very comfy, seats are soft, rear leg room is limo-like. Power of the big V8 is incredible, the car is quiet, decent sound system and has lots of fun toys like the bluetooth. It behaves very well for a truck, soft over the bumps, but feels very tough at the same time. Definitely underrated as far as the full truck segment goes and it's a shame Nissan hasn't done a better job marketing the truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior and interior styling, 20" rims, bluetooth (AWESOME), 20 mpg on the freeway in a huge truck is impressive. Easy up/down assist on tailgate, spray in bed liner and rail system in the bed are awesome!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love driving this truck. My wife has a minivan but unless we are taking a trip, we take my truck and the three kids fit comfortably in the back seat. I love the bed and the things I can do with the adjustable bed rails. Gets what the sticker said it would for MPG when I use regular unleaded. I lose about 22% if I use e85 so I only use that when it is 22-25% less than regular. So far, that is often but my small town BP sells it so it is convenient for me. Fun to drive, nice to look at, and very functional. I need to go back to the dealer to fix the Bluetooth but otherwise, no complaints.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Versatile bed, driver memory for key and fob. I love the leather interior and the comfortable ride for a big 4WD. Also love the 20" wheels. Instant fuel economy has helped me drive better for that.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Was looking for a truck that didn't drive like a heavy oversized truck but with the power and reliability to work like a full size truck. Hauled lots lumber so far almost 2000 lbs. Handled it well and drove great with the load. This truck is fun to drive and easy to hop up as well. Going to get an air intake kit soon. Still low miles on the truck just over 3k. If you drive it heavy on the gas, yes it eats the fuel, but don't drag race at every light and it's not too bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck is an excellent value. It is well thought out. Utilitrac system, outside tool compartment, sprayed on bedliner, message center, heated tow mirrors, are all nice things to have in a truck. Seats are comfortable. The ride is smooth. It handles better than many cars. Tows very well. The transmission shifts very smoothly. I have been getting 15 mpg around town and 17-18 on the highway, and 12-12.5 towing. Better payload than competitors. It tows 9100 true pounds. Looked high and low. This is the best value out there at the present time (IMO).</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a much beefier truck than the 2000 Tundra I traded for it. I find it comfortable, luxurious although not what I was looking for and a great truck for the price. Much more truck for the dollar than Toyota's flawed new Tundra that is out. I have put about 2000 miles a month on it through the winter of Northern PA and the traction was outstanding and secure. I am still adjusting to the 7.5' bed and crew cab while around town, but the bed size makes loading a snap with the utilitrac system and spray in liner.</TEXT>

The 08 LE CC is almost to pretty for a truck, but it is a truck and will be used as one like its predecessor. Its ride is improved and is quieter. The brakes, like the engine, are smooth and strong. The utili-track bed system should be in every truck on the road. I drove Ford, Toyota and Chevy and found this truck not only to be the best for the money, but the best truck overall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted a truck that would handle not only my towing and hauling needs but be very comfortable. The ride and handling are first class. The ride is smooth and quiet. The captain's chairs are very comfortable. The Rockford Fosgate sound system with the XM radio is exceptional. It makes you feel as though you are driving in a luxury automobile. The build quality is very good. There weren't any defects at delivery. The gas mileage is as expected for a large truck with this much power. I get approximately 21 MPG on the highway going around 68 MPH. Around town about 14. The king cab provides plenty of room even for a six foot tall adult. This is a quality vehicle at a bargain price.

Mileage is less than my old F350 dually diesel and it doesn't haul as much but it rides like a caddy. Added a Banks exhaust and Nismo intake - now it sounds as good as it looks. Also dumped the Rockford Fosgate amp, speakers and subwoofer and replaced with JL Audio goodies to make it thump for real. It looks great. It is comfortable. It is fast and fun. Great navigation and rear dvd. Built in ipod jack. The list goes on. Overall a great truck. Pulls our trailer adequately and hauls what we need.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Finally a Nissan with enough room to haul everything in style.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my third Nissan. This is the best truck ever. Gas mileage is not that great, (but wait). I started with Halvoline 10w 30 oil and was getting about 13 mpg around town. My first oil change I went to Valvoline 10w 30 DuraBlend and now I am getting 16.9 mpg city and about 18 mpgs on the intersate. I would have never believed this, but I tried it and it works.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>New design inside and out. Love the 20 inch wheels. The new Titan is not as noisy as the older Titans.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just as rewarding and fullfilling, but leaves nothing in the house or in the yard for you to step in. Couldn't be happier with the performance. Previous vehicle was 2000 Frontier. Upgrading to this Titan was a great move. I'm still getting the hang of parking in close quarters with the long bed. Otherwise, so much fun to drive. LE has all the comforts needed for the road.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rockford Fosgate sound is awesome. Bedside toolbox is handy. VERY spacious in backseat. This puppy gets up and goes!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased brand new 2008 Titan pro-4x, galaxy black with the leather bench and Rockford system. Awesome looking with tow and sliding bed divider. Truck has been a pleasure to drive so far. Lots of power and getting lots of looks. Radio rocks and bluetooth works well. Getting between 11-13 mpg so far; only 400 miles on truck so too early to tell how close epa mpg will be. Two issues though - truck delivered with airbag malfunction which needed a dashboard drop and new airbag module installed and the incab microfilter missing. MX shop told me 3 days to 2 weeks to get fixed - lol!!! Not great news for a brand new truck BUT fixed in 3 days.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Truck has gobs of power - interior styling much better than the tundra and american trucks. White gauges and heated seats. Stereo is the best I have heard in production vehicle. Galaxy black paint looks awesome in sunlight.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking for a car for my daughter and while I was there, test drove this truck on a whim. I was completely amazed at the ride comfort and features. I traded my Dodge Hemi- Ram Laredo that afternoon. Not a lot of difference in the power but the difference in the ride and handling is like night and day. Finally, a truly functional and capable truck that doesn't ride like a chuck-wagon or handle like a battleship.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rockford Fosgate audio is fantastic. Rides like a dream. Enough guts to do anything I need. Finally a REAL size bed on a truck. Built-in tool box is really handy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 5th vehicle and first truck. First 4 were all Honda/Acura. After signing on the dotted line, the Titan has exceeded my expectations. The throaty factory exhaust audibly transfers the engines power into a beautiful sound when you hit the gas. The Titan interior felt more like what I was accustomed to with Honda cars. All the early defects from '04 have been resolved.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auto up/down window for driver and auto-down for passenger, aux input for iPod, well cushioned seats, headroom, auto-dimming mirror/compass, steering wheel audio/cruise, ample int. storage, backup side-view mirrors that come w/towing package, interior door handles (left arm rests so comfortably)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Titan is a vehicle that provides both comfort and as needed is a workhorse. As a general contractor, we have the bulk of materials delivered to the job site. What is left are the odd ball items, a few sheets of plywood, bath fixtures etc. Most of my truck cargo is tools for specific needs and random items. The Titan handles well does not feel as bulky as the Tundra. The 5 speed transmission is smooth shifting and takes fewer RPMs with the extra gear compared to the 4 speed GMCs. The firm suspension is welcome, not much off roading done but many expressway exit ramps and the Titan holds firm. Good interior, no manual needed for controls. The Titan is comfortable and a workhorse.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent power and creature comforts. A good balance of the ruggedness of a truck while being comfortable for a "gentleman" driver. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This Titan truck is a head turner. It is fast, large roomy interior, XM radio, sound system is the finest, and the navigation system is really nice. The ride is smooth and a really quiet ride for a truck. I owned a GMC, Ford, and a Toyota over the years. The Titan compares evenly. I'm looking for dependability. This Nissan will provide it. It will pull a toy trailer with ease!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went looking for a replacement for my 2002 Ford F150 Supercrew. I test drove another Ford and also a Chevy, Dodge, Toyota, Honda and GMC but really loved the Titan Pro-4x. Large beautiful interior, Rockord Fosgate stereo, memory seats, Bluetooth, smooth ride and an awesome exhaust note. I really like the way the back seats fold up out of the way giving my dogs or the groceries lots of space. The cargo area is well designed with a 12-volt accessory jack, tailgate lights, factory spray in liner, utilitrack cargo tie-down system and an assisted lockable tailgate. I recently took a 900 mile trip and averaged 17.1 mpg on the highway. Not too bad for a 317 hp V8. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded up from a 2004 and have to say Nissan did a better job listening to the input from consumers on what was working and not working. FFV as standard on most of their trucks gives a great alternate fuel. I've averaged 12 mpg city and 14 mpg highway on ethanol (E85). At 50 cents less a gallon, the cost savings start adding up with very little mileage loss. Better larger brakes, 20 inch rims and tires to boot. I have the new long bed combined with Crew Cab. Can haul more gear and the gang with spacious cabin room. Ride is better with longer frame as well. I've owned trucks from Chevy and Ford. The Titan quality stands out by far. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>New Bluetooth capability for hands free phone conversations. Dual climate control. Larger brakes and 20" rims. Power gear window. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Former Dodge owner (was going to buy another) but Titan had better performance (acceleration, 4-wheel ABS) and way more features than similar Ram (R-F Stereo, pwr rear window, utili-trak bed/spray-in liner, rear sonar, rear panel storage). It would have cost an add'l $4k to get Ram to similar features and Titan was less to begin with. As for the Titan itself, the captain?s chairs (and back seats) are very comfortable and there is tons of leg room in the back (not so much in the Ram). Gas mileage has been so-so, all city driving (including moderate hills) gets me 13.7-14.1 mpg but a truck is a truck. I haven?t really done enough interstate miles to get a good evaluation of that mileage. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>R-F speakers sound great, great acceleration (even at cruising), roomy cab (lift back seats up and have lots of room on floor for dogs to lay down), easy lift tailgate, fender storage is handy for straps etc, pwr rear window. Fits very nicely in garage (shorter bed), center console can hold folders.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Recently had to choose one of the 5 great full sizes offered. The Nissan was not only very well priced, but it's the only 1/2 ton pickup with a full size 4dr cab and a 7ft+ bed. Great combo for someone like me who loves to put motorcycles in the back and go camping. Very quiet which is great, the dual zone climate control works flawlessly and the chairs are comfortable!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The bluetooth option is awesome! Works so well. The power is awesome, handles great, and is so quiet! Interior is really nice for a truck. I dig the rockford fosgate system, really great! Utilitrak system in the bed is very useful as well!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first full-size pickup and I must say that I am pleasantly pleased with my purchase. The thing that made me go Nissan (besides its attractive looks, great engine and value) was the fact that it was one of the largest interior and short-box bed pickups that actually fit in my garage. The interior is very well put together and the features are luxo-car plush. The navigation is high resolution and the gauges glow attractiveley at night. I do wish for a touchscreen nav and incoming call info for the Bluetooth coming from an Acura TL and being spoiled. I have already hauled two huge loads (one 2,400 lb sand and one 2,040 lb brick) and the truck handled it with ease.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior stance and presence. Interior room, comfort and features especially nac and bluetooth. Dampened tailgate and bedliner are great, useful additions. Uses regular fuel and getting about 14.8 mixed driving at 6,000 feet above sea level.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've looked at the Titans for a long time and was excited about the remodel for 2008. I took advantage of the rebate offered and am pleased with the price paid. Nissan really did a good job designing this truck and the interior room is outstanding. The only options that I got on the SE were floor mats and a bedliner. That's really all I need because there are already lots of features that come standard. The ride is stiff but comfortable and I've been surprised at the quietness of the ride so far. All in all, I'm very pleased and am glad I chose this over the F-150 and Silverado.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We are a Nissan family with three in the driveway. We traded our LE 4dr Frontier for the Titan. Rides better, seats feel better with its arm rests. Drives great on the highway. Dark blue with tan seats look great. The front looks looks so much macho. Stereo much better than the Frontiers. On top of it the Titan was cheaper than our Frontier. Mileage isn't that much of the diference from the Frontier, yet we feel safer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is by far the best truck on the market. I had an 04 Titan and traded up for the 08 and I am strangely imprssed more with this truck than I was the first go around. Great interior/exterior, awesome luxury features and it drives like a car with tons of power. People will only gripe about the mpg, but what do you expect from a truck with this type of engine. All the testing reports prove that the GM brands claim they get the highest, but get the lowest. I have been getting about 15 city. I priced out every vehicle with my options and this truck was not only the best, but with the current rebates on all 5 makers, it was 3,400 cheaper than any, and mine is an 08 compared to their 07's</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded in my 2006 Audi A4 Quattro and my 2004 Ford Ranger for this truck. I've always loved my audi for its fit and finish, and fun to drive factor and the ranger for its ability to tow our boat and jetskis. I needed a full size truck to tow our "toys" more easily. The Titan is great for towing and has every single feature I had on my Audi. It's the best of both worlds. The truck was fully loaded with XM radio, Rockford Fosgate audio, leather, moonroof, nav, bluetooth, rear dvd ent system. In one week I've racked up 1980 miles avg highway is 17 mpg, city approx 13. If you drive over 70, say 80ish, fuel econ drops sharply to 14-15. PRO4x ride is firmer than LE but smooth on highway.</TEXT>

Better comfort and interior than the new Tundra, better performance, comfort and fit and finish than the F-150 and the Chevy. I am getting 15.9 MPG city driving, 17.1 hwy. In addition it has a smaller exterior and a roomier interior than all the competition, very well thought through.</TEXT>
