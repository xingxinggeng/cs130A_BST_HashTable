<TEXT>I have owned 5 new mini-vans since 1986, and this is be far the best one I've owned. We like all the extra features and have had not trouble of any kind since I purchased it. This is much improved from the 2005 model I owned. The 2005 model was the worst one I've owned. I would like a little better mileage, but it's not bad for a heavy van. I think a lot of people complain about their vans, but they probably complain about most everything they have. I also question how they drive and service them. I have driven over 1,500,000 miles in 17 new GM, Ford and Chrysler products, and never had much trouble with any of them. Don't drive them like a race car and service them properly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We leased a 2008 Town & Country and have had nothing but problems. Three days into the lease brakes made noise and stearing was off. We hadd to get new brakes, roters and a wheel alignment. Doors were opening on thier own or not closing. Drove to Florida, the radiator cap blew and radio would not work for 3 hours, radio stations change on thier own. The van is horrible and we are fighting to get out of the lease, the dealership was horrible, they are located in Jersey, they could care less that we had all the problems, they gave me a PT cruiser as a rental and made me change cars outside in a snow storm with a 3 year old and a 7 month old, no help and would not let me in the garage!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Brakes and tires need replaced at 24000 miles. There is a constant rattle in the overhead entertainment system that the dealership cannot keep fixed. Fuel economy is not great. Advertises 24 but with my family of six we have never gotten to 24, usually more like 22 on the hwy with a combined average of 18.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have an early build 20087, and it has been great. The only issue we have had has been the premature brake wear (that I caught right before 12K miles so dealer covered the cost). The fuel economy of this van has been fantastic, we have taken several road trips with full cargo area, and nothing at all is creaking, making noise, or otherwise working poorly. It is super comfortable, and looks great in brilliant silver. This is my first T&C as I could not buy a Honda since my Accord has had 4, yes 4, transmissions and a front end repaint since being bought new in 2002.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power tailgate and doors, DVD that is front loading (our kids are in car seats and would not be able to reach up high like in other vans), ambient lighting, rear camera. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought the van due to transmission issues with our 1998 Tahoe with over 150000 miles, thinking we could avoid repairs for some time. What a joke. First it was DVD/NAV system problems, then the AC, NAV again, Front brakes at 23000 miles, Folding seats don't come up, Transmission Valve body- while driving to Soccer Toury- I coach need to be there on time- Stuck me in match box car for rental with three children, luggage, and equipment. This was Friday, did not get van back for 6 days and had to drive over 150 miles to pick up. Now at 35000 the rear brakes need to be replaced- thing is they don't have an after market brake YET it will cost $195 for this. It makes me sick- Never again!!!!!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got this brand new in July 08. May 09 - AC completely dead. Was told it is a known problem. It took two weeks to get the part. June 09 - luggage rack knob twists off. June 09 - transmission completely went out traveling to SC. Dealer in Florence told me there's nothing wrong though it could not move when towed in on Saturday. A week later traveling home transmission went out in VA - had to have a brand new one installed in VA (I live in Ohio). Was told this is a common problem. Not willing to pay expenses related to extra nights stay and travel from VA to OH and back. August 09 rear brakes froze - told known problem - 10 days now and they still can't find parts.

<TEXT>I bought this 45,000 vehicle in 6/08. By end of July the air had quit. Took it to get fixed. 2 weeks later I discovered an air conditioner leak that had MUSHROOMS growing in front passenger floorboard. I will send pics if any one doesn't believe this! Also brakes were messed up (crunching sound) at about 4000 miles. Took several times with them saying nothing wrong and finally had to be replaced @ 21000 miles. The all electric 3rd row seat had 2 b fixed b/c motor quit working on one side. The sliding passenger doors don't always close & has to be manually closed. Oh and the brakes are "crunching" again @ 30000 miles. Presets on the Satellite radio only (not fm) disappear & hav 2 b reprogrammed</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased our Limited with 18k, now has 26k. We've had a few minor problems with the power sliding doors (one door sometimes does not open in extreme cold, the other needed an adjustment, both were oversensitive in the operation - software fix) and with the radio/nav unit (restarting the ignition fixed it). Otherwise, it's been trouble-free. Very cushy. Front seats could use more shoulder/neck support and adjustable headrests. 3rd row lacks legroom, but then, it's designed for kids. Poor HVAC control design. MPG is around 15 city, and we've gotten as much as 31 highway @65-70 mph. If you're in the market and can afford it, get the Ltd. The 3.3 and 3.8 have no real power; the 4.0 does.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this piece of American junk in 08. So far the doors have needed work, the heater/ac blower motor works intermittently, the dealer of course cant find a problem. Just got the front brakes done at 23,000 miles. My guess is the use of sub grade materials, poor acceleration on highway, brake calipers frozen on rear brakes and dealership tells me it could be a week before they come in. My hope is Chrysler disappears from the business. I will never buy another. Completely sickened by the company and their unwillingness to fix any problem unless it's out of the warranty period. Bunch of crooks...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I could not be happier with my Town and Country Limited. This is the first time we splurged on"accessories" in a car but it was all worth it. We just got back from a road-trip to Florida from New York. I have 3 kids (11, 9 & 6) and they could not have been happier with the satellite TV. We're not huge TV people but it is a great way of breaking up car-time. This is also the first time that we hit no traffic taking our annual road trip to FL without hitting any traffic. I give the superior navigation system and Sirius traffic all the credit. Besides the electronics, the car is very comfortable for both me and my husband. This is all of our favorite car ever- especially my children!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just hit 1000 miles, and are happy with our new T&C so far. We primarily bought it due to the excellent price for the number of features. It's not as powerful and doesn't have the car- like handling some of the competitors do, but it is clearly better than the previous T&C. It's very quiet on smooth surfaces, but you do get quite a bit of noise from the tires & suspension when on broken pavement. The power sliding doors were the weak link on our previous T&C, and it looks like they may still be a problem area (one side is already making a funky sound and doesn't always want to close). Fuel mileage is close to the EPA numbers, if you go easy on the throttle. Kids love the dual DVD Players.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the T&C because it has the Satellite back seat TV. If you have kids, there is nothing better to make your trips enjoyable. Traded a Highlander, and love the extra room. Looked at Swivel & Go, and went with Stow & Go. Ability to stow the middle seats is extremely handy. Pleasantly surprised at highway mileage, almost 25 MPG with 4.0 V6, about 17 around town. Wanted the Touring edition, but dealer made great deal for a Limited, happy we went with that model. The technology built in is amazing. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought my 5th Town and Country hoping that the new design was improved. I'm 6'3" and the driver leg room, with the electric seat all the way back, is so much less than previous years - my right leg is hurting from having to raise my foot to function the brake. In addition, this car is getting 30% less miles per gallon than my '07 T&C - under 13 miles per gallon in the city! I am very unhappy with the car and would return it, but the dealer wants to charge me 25% ($7,500) on a trade and I have only 1200 miles. Think this is my last Chrysler!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We leased at 2008 Chrysler t&c. Big mistake. The transmission went bad the day we took it home! Still hassling with Chrysler. You won't believe where this American made car houses some of its customer service. India. How is that for made in America? On the up side like the stow n go. That's what led us to it.

<TEXT>Our troubles began approximately 2 wks after our purchase. The MyGig system has given us plenty of trouble. It has frozen up, it turns off and on by itself, the volume will go to 100% and then down to mute, CDs will lock up, the touch screen will not respond, the Nav screen will freeze up, and more. Including the hard system, computer and touch screen, we are on our fourth system to include all the software updates but to no avail. We are also having issues with the side doors; they are overly sensitive consequently they retract with the slightest pressure. If it were not for the issues with the My Gig system, the 2008 T&C would definitely be our family's all time favorite vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We love the ability to set our individual temp. The heated seats are wonderful but could have an option to heat the bottom or the back separately. When it works, the MyGig system is awesome. The remote start is especially nice on cold mornings. The remote doors are nice when yours hands are full.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned several cars and minivans over the years. My wife's previous vehicle was a 01 T&C with 139K miles which we traded for this new T&C. I am a life long Corvette owner. Let me tell you, I argue with my wife daily in letting me drive this vehicle. Chrysler invented the Minivan, they have to made it so much better. I love to be seen in this vehicle, everywhere I stop people ask me about the vehicle. I just reply "it is like being in your family room with the added feature of movement". To date I have not seen a crossover that can compete with this vehicle. The days of a minivan not being a "cool" vehicle are over. This is by far the "COOLEST" vehicle on four wheels for the Family..</TEXT>

<TEXT>I used to love taking the family around in the old T&C's. So what the devil happened? The dumb keyless fob that you still need to insert and turn. The moronic positioning of the bloody shifter. It actually feels smaller and cramped inside. The only thing that did not change (which should have) is the darn engine that still screams and barks while limping to speed. So sad. Will be trading this out for a loss ASAP and will be looking for a station wagon or small suv.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ok, after looking at Honda and Toyota, we selected this one because of the features. Satellite TV, Dual DVDs, great Nav, etc. Neither Honda or Toyota could touch it. We took it down to Walt Disney World on its first trip and everyone enjoyed it. It was on the return that the "nightmare" started. This van has some electrical issues that are MAJOR safety issues. After 10 days, it is in the shop now awaiting replacement of some modules that control almost every electrical accessory in the van. Not sure if it is all of them or just some, but it does seem common. Other than this, we absolutely love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Town and Country seems to get worse with every model year. I've had a Plymouth Voyager back in '89, then again in '92, switched to the Grand Caravan in 98 and the T&C in 05, now I 've got an '08. The name goes on but the quality never goes in, electrical problems just like in the '05 model, although I was assured they were all worked out. Yes, I'm covered under the warranty, except all the inconveniences and time from work I'm losing, this one is going back, I lose about 10K but I think with all the problems I've had Chrysler has another LEMON on its hands...</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I walked into the dealership and saw comparably priced Jeeps and other SUVs, I felt as though I should hang my head in shame for considering a minivan at $40,000. As it turns out, this may be the greatest purchase yet! I think I just purchased a living room on wheels. We opted for the limited- which has tons of extras- and surprisingly, really wasn't that much more expensive. Before the trade, I got this vehicle for a hair under $37k, and I am pretty sure there aren't any options that didn't come on it. The real reason we went for the limited was the upgraded seats, which are extremely comfortable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Being a buyer of 2 Kia Sedonas in the last 4 years I likely would have stayed with them had I not had a hassle over replacement of a transmission slightly out of warranty. Lucky for me all my maintenance was done at the dealer, and I had 5 service orders questioning the transmission operation. This T&C van is far roomier, very comfortable and it's power assist options are very welcome for the physically challenged driver such as myself. My powerchair lift was able to be installed to leave me 60% of the rear seat available if I don't take my chair with me. It is much larger than my 2004 Sedona and yet the mileage is about the same. I took the Lifetime bumper to bumper warranty. I love it</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our second van. Leased a 2006 T&C as well. Besides the fact that I had to put brakes on the first one after 17,000 miles, I was pretty happy with it. I think the interior one the 2008 was meant to be world's ahead of the last model, but it is not. The materials are very cheap. Fit and finish is deplorable. I don't consider this a launch vehicle, as this has been in production since the summer of 2007, so that is not a valid excuse. Gas mileage is terrible.

I was hooked on the Pacifica's and actually owned two different ones. Well, kids and their friends and their sporting equipment took over and I had to have more room. I swore to NEVER drive a van! That is, until this one came along. I didn't know what I'd been missing. I'm now a mini-van momma and lovin it! I should have crossed over to van-land years ago!

<TEXT>This is my first new car. I had an 07 Pontiac Montana and it was a great van. I thought that i would love the Chrysler, so we traded in our Pontiac and got the Chrysler. I think that it need a more powerful engine and better gas mileage. I don't drive on the freeway a lot, so that is even worse for the gas mileage. My big complaint is the sliding doors. My car has been in 3 times because the doors will bounce back open. I am glad for that safety feature however not when i am unaware that it had opened again and stayed that way all night. when we took it in they couldn't find anything wrong with it. Then they ordered a part, then they re-loaded the software. Now it's an 08 problem. What to do</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ok, we never buy American cars and we never buy a car in its first year of production but we made an exception here and are very glad we did! The features, quality, and price of the Limited are amazing; you really get a lot more than Honda, Nissan or Toy. for a lot less. The 08 Honda is dated and will be redesigned in 09, the Nissan is likely to be discontinued in 09, and the Toy. is just to costly to be a contender. That left the T&C and we think it is a winner. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DVD system. Navigation system is just amazing and we have used a lot of them, Bluetooth interface is world class - think BMW quality or better, quiet cabin, good performance from the 4L. The remote start is so great! Oh, and that little flashlight really is useful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is actually our 2nd Town & Country purchase. We had absolutely no problems with our last one, just ran the mileage up and loved the improved look of the new 2008 models. We opted for a darker interior as we have 3 kids and they tend to spill every now and then - seats and carpet are stain proofed! Nice for the passengers to be able to open all of the back windows. Center console is great..lots of cupholders throughout. We looked at the swivel and go seating and there just wasn't enough knee room with the seating arrangement. We opted for the stow n go which is very convenient - tons of extra storage capacity underneath .</TEXT>

<TEXT>Three years ago we decided it was time to move out of our minivan and into a full size car. After all, the kids were grown and why did we need a minivan any more. We missed having enough room for 6 adults and we're tired of paying delivery charges for larger purchases. We did some test drives and the new Chrysler Town and Country really stood out from the rest. Driver and passenger comforts of the T & C exceeded all the others. We love the leg room for the front seat passenger (wife couldn't cross ankles in Honda's Odyssey) and the passenger side 8 way power seats. The new look is also very impressive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I are extremely happy with our purchase! The Town and Country is spacious, convenient, loaded with features-- 2 DVDs, GPS Nav (screen acts as 3rd TV in park), Swivel n' Go. We opted for the manual 3rd row reconfigure; the power feature is nice, but not required since manual reconfiguring is easy. Gas mileage is pretty much as advertised on the sticker (much better than the SUV we traded in!), but could be improved w/ a diesel engine. We test drove a 4.0L in the limited, and it was peppier, but we are happy with the 3.8 (and we're used to an overpowered SUV). Overall, an excellent product from Chrysler! Shoppers- also look at the Dodge Grand Caravan... only difference is looks.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MyGig entertainment, Swivel n' Go (seats can also be removed), 2 DVD screens, Sirius satellite, back-up camera and sensors, 3rd row tailgate configuration, and designed for comfort and convenience throughout (cupholders, 2 glove boxes, underfloor storage, etc.).

<TEXT>Swivel n go is the best for carpool. The kids pop in and out with so much ease. The toughest part is deciding who gets to sit backward. It rides smooth. The entertainment options are super for a long car ride. The LED lights make it so easy to drive at night and let kids still do homework, read books etc. I really like the new exterior, less of an attempt at sporty --it's a minivan. The MyGig is impressive, but can take too much attention while driving. Love the Bluetooth built in. Second row cupholders are only bottle on the door less than ideal. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Odyssey is awesome and absolutely a better drive at any trim level then the T&C. However, if you closely compare the standard feature set on the Honda and compare it to the T&C it becomes clear that if you care more about value and less about handling and performance (it's a minivan!) then the T&C wins. I bought a Touring T&C with the M package for 29,000 dollars. A similar Honda costs almost 4000 more at invoice. Personally I don't think the Honda's moon roof and engine superiority warrant a 4 thousand dollar difference. Figure in Chrysler's life time drivetrain warranty along with it's feature set and you have a great value. BTW - I think the Limited kills the T&Cs value over Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had the vehicle a few weeks, but the interior layout is very good. The layout is better than our 2001 Odyssey. The smaller engine definitely lacks power. The automatic transmission tries to compensate, which causes the gas mileage to be a little lower than I would like. But the you can shift gears yourself to compensate. The DVD player is nice. As are the wireless headphones. The rear parking camera is great. The stow and go gives a ton of interior space for storage. The second glovebox is also nice. After the transmission failure on our last van, the lifetime warranty on the Chrysler put us in this van over the entry level Toyota Sienna.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I should have known. I had a bad feeling as the ink was drying on the paperwork at the dealership. We bought a brand new 2008 Town & Country stow and go on Saturday, Dec. 29th. As the salesman was delivering the car, we couldn't get the keyless start to work. So service had to fix it. Then yesterday, a warning beep sounds and a light comes on that says "ESP BAS." ESP is not defined in the owner's manual and BAS doesn't even appear. If you don't know the acronym you're left clueless. When I called the dealership, even the service manager didn't know what ESP BAS stood for. He had to look it up. I had to return to the dealer, taking time out of my weekday to do so to have it fixed. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>They couldn't fix it. They had to order a part. The car has 106 miles on it and has broken twice. And now I get to take off and sit and wait to get it fixed again when the part finally comes in. I've bought my first and last Chrysler. Should have stuck with Ford.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just purchased a 2008 Black Limited w/ navigation and sunroof. Did not opt for DVD since no kids and 3 dogs. Overall first impressions are great. Smooth ride, comfortable, very quiet. Fit and finish looks great. Navigation is easy to use as is the bluetooth function. Voice recognition is a little difficult to setup. Previously owned a Toyota Sienna which had several recalls, not as comfortable, and overall did not impress. Traded a 2007 Hyundai Entourage for Chrysler. The Hyundai was a good van but lacked several features and depreciation faster than you could imagine. Put this van at the top of your list!</TEXT>

We also like the updated body style, backseat TV-free for one year with select models. (Disney, Nick, & Cartoon Net), along w/Sirius radio-- can't go wrong and you will get extra points with your kids for buying such a cool vehicle. If you have kids, this is the vehicle you need--you won't be disappointed. The GPS system is very user-friendly, and for those of you who tend to take a few wrong turns now and then, you are in luck with the navigation system=it gets you there! </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have two toddlers and a teenager and we were looking for a vehicle that accomodated the family and all our things. We have been resisting the minivan market, but the Family Room on Wheels commercial made us test drive the T&C. We ended up buying it and absolutely love it. The toddlers are disappointed when they have to ride with me in my Tahoe. The ride is great, it rides like a car with minimal interior noise and an overall smooth ride. The seats are comfortable and the features are endless. We have the dark blue with cream interior which looks great and the amount of chrome outside really makes the colors pop.

<TEXT>After owning three Chrysler minivans we decided to buy a new van this fall. We looked at the Honda, Toyota and Chrysler vans and decided that the Chrysler fitted our needs better than the other two. The Chrysler has not disappointed. It is extremely quiet, rides well,and has plenty of power with the 4.0 L engine which has given us better than 20 miles per gallon since we have owned the van. The stow and go seating is great for carrying big stuff. So far so good and we are looking for a good number of happy years driving this vehicle. </TEXT>

The 08 has decent exterior styling (a bit boxy) but make no mistake - it is the interior that is gorgeous. Ours is loaded with pretty much everything. The neon lights with the backlighting around the DVD consoles makes it pure business class. Power 3rd row seat folders - brilliant. The MyGIG entertainment and navigation is brilliant. Fantastic ride, smooth even on horrible Michigan roads. Wife loves it, kids love it - what can I say - Dad is suddenly cool. </TEXT>

When I first saw it, I thought wow. This really looks nice. Almost like an SUV. It drives ok, though the steering can be stiff at times, and fun to drive. Numerous options. Love the dual DVD for the kids, TV really helps. Swivel 'n Go finally gets them playing the million games they never use. We've had it for 2 months and love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When our lease on Pacifica was up, we came to the dealership with our 2 kids. There was this "living room on wheels" on display. We all got inside and were amazed. Hey, we are still amazed. I agree that its boxy behind is not very sexy, but it is amazingly practical. It is the insides that count. Starting from the 4.0 very powerful engine to 3 tvs (driver can watch tv when the van is in Parked gear), to the only available vehicle with a Satellite TV, it is the best all-around car for a family. I especially like to see the surprised faces of the drivers I just passed in my rearview mirror, who don't expect such a performance from a minivan. Move over, the fastest living room on wheels is here</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just bought this van and all I have to saw is that we are surprised. This van substituted my wife's 2005 VW Passat Wagon (which we loved), but we needed more space for the kids. I must admit that I was concerned about buying american, but after seeing the price and the initial reviews we decided to give it a try. All I can say is, wow. I was impressed by the looks, quality and overall feel of the vehicel. It does not corner like a sporty sedan, but it is comfortable on the roads. The traction control and brake assist are Awsome. My wife has driven through a few rain storms and she reporetd that she felt the car's braking and handling in the rain we just like her old passat :).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Swivel and go seating is very cool when hanging out with the kids and playing board games during road trips. 3 (yes, three) media systems to keep everyone occupied.

The transmission is very sluggish and the swivel and go seats are very unsafe. My friend got in a crash with her kids in a 2008. the seats were swiveld and her kids got serious whiplash. I want to trade it in when lease is up for a new Honda Odyssey. I don't like the the power doors, because my son got his finger stuck and door did not reverse.

<TEXT>Whats an amazing change from the old shape to this new shape, everything is different. I like the little touches that really make this car feel like a high end European car vs the cheap plastic trip we have gotten used to in our domestic minivans. The first major improvement is the room for the driver and 2nd row passengers. I am 6'3" (long torso) and i have zero problems driving this car or sitting in the 2nd row (swivel n go). We did test drive the stow n go 2nd row and the seat backs were just too low down for me, the top of headrest was below my shoulders so we had to go for the swivel n go anyway which are bucket heater leather seats just like the front (we have the 25L package).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Swivel and Go seating is excellent, you can turn the second row 90 degrees (facing you while you are standing outside the van) to put kids in and take kids out of their car seats, it also has very easy to access latch system for car seats to attach. Rear backup camera is also very cool.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>On the whole my wife, kids and I love the van. As our first new car we like all the gadgets and the new car feel. BUT... after 10,000 miles I can hear both sliders make a creaking noise when taking off and just before coming to a stop. Also when hitting the brakes I get a vibration in the steering wheel and in the whole van.The faster I'm going when I hit the brakes the worse it is. After reading some of the reviews, this sounds like a rotor, pad problem. I may be wrong but I don't think a 42,000 dollar van [Paid 30] should do that. We also have the pass slider that wont close all the way unless done by hand. I haven't brought it in yet, so we'll see. </TEXT>

We traded my old sedan for the T & C and have not looked back. THe van is simply the most incredible, family oriented vehicle on the market. The DVD system is great for the boys (ages 4 and 2- year-old twins). After owning for a month we packed it up and headed ten hours south to Virginia Beach. Van performed great. We had it to the dealer once for a DVD door that was sticking when trying to close...Scranton Dodge swapped out the entire system and even changed the oil..on them! So far, van is exceeding our expectations.</TEXT>

It goes from 1750 rpms to 2500 almost continuosly. Then the anti theft switch went bad while in drive way and had to have it towed. It took three weeks to get new switch. It has about 16000 miles and the tires are making loud noise and it appears also brakes may need work. No wonder they are going bankrupt.

Back passenger doors do not close properly have to use handle most of the time. Brakes & rotor went out at 22,000 miles. Rotten egg smell. Air conditioning stopped working. Have taken to dealer over 10 times and they can not fix or duplicate any of the problems the first time. It takes them at least 4 times to get anything addressed. Dealership has been no help.

<TEXT>We bought the van shortly after the arrival of our 2nd child. We figured we needed the room and went with the most popular model out there. One week after ownership, the tire monitor goes off and there's a leak in the rim. Dealer replaces the monitor. Week later, its back. Dealer fixes it. 2 months later, its back. Meanwhile, the side door has stopped closing all the way. Dealer takes 4 stabs at it before ordering all new mounting parts for the door. 15,000 miles into ownership and the brakes and rotors are so far gone that they are in need of $300 replacement. Dealer tells me its common for this van and I can expect that every $15,000 miles. Value dropped so now I cant sell it. Yay Chrysler</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am sorry I ever bought this minivan. It was advertised by Chrysler to have power mirrors included as standard equipment, and it came without them.

Chrysler will do nothing to remedy this problem, and I filed a BBB on the Chrysler LLC CO. and Chrysler would not even respond to this complaint.

Within first week, back in shop for vibration over 60 mph-shop balanced tires, still vibrates. Rumbles, shudders at times when in park; jerks forward with rolling stops. Compared to previous T&C vans: cheap plastic, leather and cloth mixed in places, uncomfortable rear seats, cheap hard "leather" steering wheel, stiffness, feel the bumps, increasing highway wind noise the longer I drive it, poor window tinting design everywhere. Middle console slides into floor storage doors.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So, I traded in my Toyota Sienna to help the US economy and bought a Town and Country. Are you kidding me??? After 3 months and 2500 miles the following has already needed to be repaired. 1) Alignment was way off. 2) Gear shifter replaced (well not yet it is on back order!)Broken AND squeaks 3) Driver's side window regualtor. 4) Ignition modules with 2 keys. Key got stuck and could not remove. First one broke 5)Replaced and relubed hubcaps due to excessive noise. How am I supposed to feel for my family's safety?? What next? I am trading this piece of junk in for a Sienna. Oh, in case you are wondering, I bought this in November 08 for 20k after rebates...trade in value 2/08 13k! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This mini van is wonderful! We were deciding between the Honda and the T & C. I'm thrilled with our choice! While I think the Honda may drive better, the price for this can't be beat! Honda was almost $6,000 more expensive and we didn't get nearly as many "perks." The dual DVD, power doors (including the rear) and the space inside can't be beat. The Honda did not feel nearly as spacious and there weren't as many little places to put things. The inside of the car is very comfortable and easy to get around in. The back up camera is great. The option for the lifetime warranty is a good deal if you plan on keeping it for a long time. This is a great car at an amazing price, this is it! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The middle console is great for extra storage. We love that you can plug in using a standard plug in the backseat. It's great for trips. The DVD players are easy to use ad the storage space in the middle is awesome. Stow and go is wonderful. It is what separates T & C from the rest of the minivans.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our 2nd Chrysler product (1st was '02 Dodge Grand Caravan). The T&C has a very weak engine. Our old van was quicker with the same engine (3.8L). Our 2nd choice, the Odyssey, is much more impressive in the fun-to- drive factor as minivans go. The styling of the T&C is too blocky for my tastes. However, the T&C is all about what's on the inside. The dual DVDs, hard drive, and satellite radio made our 600+ mile trip to Myrtle Beach very pleasurable. The ride is very comfortable. The fit and finish is a little disappointing. The front door does not quite line up with the rear door, which is noticeable from the side mirror while driving. Overall a great value for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Took delivery 11/08 and right off the bat the back up camera did not function. I felt the dealership was trying to deny anything was ever wrong, but sure enough Took on a trip to CA, rattling in the front, where the window and dash meet. Only happens when traveling over 60 miles an hour, but intermittently. Have had only one follow up phone call from the sales guy to see how things are going. Very disappointing to me. I had looked at the Toyota Sienna, but it was $5000 more in price with the same equipment. Should I have spent the extra for a better vehicle? Time will tell. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I never though I would lease Chrysler but I leased two mini vans one in 2006 and another in 2008. 2008 van is so far the luxuriest with stow & go, leather, DVD etc. Odometer clocked 21500 miles, no trouble. One surprise for me is front brake pads worn out totally at 20000 miles. one recall for radiator fix. Other than that, I have very pleasant experience with this car. consistently good mileage on highway (26.5) and local around 18mpg. With AC, playstation 2, radio I think that is a good mileage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle for my wife in May of 2008. Better gas mileage, haven't seen it yet. 3 months old and approx. 3,000 miles radio would lock up. Chrysler replaced radio. 1000 miles later radio did the same and transmission was leaking. Chrysler said that they could not replicate the radio and that they just tighten the trans. pan. They wanted it to happen and let them see the problem. They said then that the software may be bad then. But wanted to wait and see what happens. Now while driving at night, at 11800 miles, all electrical flashes off, including headlights. Scaried to drive it now. Won't buy this product again. Family vehicle or family death trap? </TEXT>

It was reliable for the first 8 mos and then after than I started having multiple electrical problems, dashboard blackout, no volume on radio, door failure, remote failure, no heat in the dead of WI winter and no automatic functions on electrical. Things would spontaneously correct after either stopping and restarting the vehicle or after two or three hours of letting it sit and restarting again. We had the new ignition module put in and problems are now worse. I am currently waiting on a second tow. I used to love this car, but have lost my confidence in its reliability.</TEXT>

The life time transmission well thank god for life time you will need it!

That will cost $500 and a body shop..2 times for the alarm not working. I hate this van!Save your money!</TEXT>

Talk about fuel economy, 28 on a trip.18-19 around town. There isn't any foreign car or van that I think would compare to this van all around.

<TEXT>Bought my van begining of the year. So far, I have had quirky little problems. If the Keypod is not turned on and "clicked back" nothing works, heat, radio, lights. I took it in and of course, nothing wrong. Took it back in a 3 weeks later because if I do a "california" stop, it jerks foward. Dealership told me that I need to stop at a stop sign. Lots and lots of brake dust flying out of my front tires. Said that was normal. Asked if I could get new brake pads put on, yes, for for a price. Sliding doors flew open or would not shut, fixed by new "download" repair. Now I just got back need all new ball bearings in tires. I'm going back to Chevy. </TEXT>

Van has stow n'go seating, no tvs or navigation system. Bought a Garman Nuvi GPS instead which is very satisfactory. Warranty work so far: adjust the latches on two doors and address rattle in overhead console via Chrysler bulletin by torquing bolts that hold the console to the ceiling and taping a loose wiring harness behind the front light indside the overhead console.

<TEXT>I really like the looks and convenience features of the van. It has a solid feel on the road and a good ride. I am disappointed in the initial quality. We have had several electrical issues; dashboard blackouts, radio failure, a "clicking" noise in the upper console above the second row seats. 28 days in the shop within 6 mos. of ownership. Most problems were fixed with updated control modules but the "click" is still there and they can't figure it out. Gas mileage is not as good as rated, 20 to 22 mpg is the best it delivered on a rating of 24. If Chrysler could deliver better quality their designs would be tough for the competition to beat.

We decided on the Touring Signature Series. We have had it about 3 months now and my wife loves it. It is very comfortable and still amazes me the amount of features this van has for the price. The seats are comfortable and riding in back is great. The drop down dvd players with cartoon channels makes it easy for kids to watch different things. Gas mileage is very reasonable for a vehicle this size, we are averaging about 20-21 mpg mixed use driving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>On a trip of about 160 miles of mostly highway driving at 65 mph, the computer reported 24.4 mpg with the 4.0 engine. The ride is quiet, seats are comfortable,and acceleration is impressive for the vehicle's size. Resetting the mpg meter to see what the vehicle will get around town, it appears to be between 17-18mpg. Now I only have about 1500 miles on the van, so I don't have a lot of data. The amount of electronic/electronic stuff is scary but if the vehicle is as reliable as my other 2 Chrysler vehicles ('01 300M & 96 Caravan) I'll be very happy. I'm not a dedicated Chrysler fan but I've picked them for their price/features/ and looks. But I still like the rounded looks of the 96 better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This van has been great for my wife and I, and also for our two girls. I chose this van over it's competitor (the Honda Odyssey) because of all the extra bells and whistles that it came with at a reasonable price. We still have not used all the options- ( like the hard drive and stuff) but as for now everything seems to work great and it?s a nice smooth ride. It is also easy to get in and out for both us and our kids. The stow and go makes it so we can hall bigger thing we buy with out needing to take the truck all the time. We have enjoyed this van. It gives us a lot of information that we find useful as we are on our trips.(Tire psi, gas mileage, in and out Temp, GPS,and much more. :) </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We enjoy all of the entertainment options, back stow and go,power everything.

This is a great family vehicle and very comfortable. It truly is like sitting in your living room!! This car is significantly quieter than prior models. Road noise is still there, but not bad. The 3.8 liter is not going to win any races, but it has adequate power for Mom as well as for highway driving. Dash is very plush and controls are easy to use. Headrests are dramatically improved over prior vans. Altogether, I recommend this van. </TEXT>

We found a retail store that sold the replacement tire, but was told that no tires were available(17" wheel) from the factory. All available tires were used for the 2008 vans. We had to get a hotel room, to wait for a dealership to open(missing a day from work). The dealership was unable to get a new tire, but they found an old tire off a used vehicle. we were finally able to get home.

<TEXT>Traded a 2002 Mercury Villager, and can only hope the Chrysler is as good a vehicle as the Villager proved to be. Kids love all the video and multimedia bells and whistles. Although the heated 2nd row seats were much anticipated, it appears the built-in boosters eliminate that feature with absolutely no disclosure by the window sticker, nor anywhere I can find in the manual. Deplore the lack of automatic climate control in trim levels below Limited. Air conditioning is extremely anemic compared to the Villager.

But for utility and space the T&C is the best. And that's what minivans are for. We took it on a trip this week to Chicago with 2 adults and 4 kids. Lots of space and the satellite TV kept the kids happy. Power doors made entry and exit easy. Stow and Go is a marvel. It is so practical. My other car is a Porsche 911 and the wife a Mercedes GL.

We had a problem with the windshield not being sealed all the way. We had no problem getting it fixed. Maybe people should be a little bit more understanding that it is the first year of a new model.

<TEXT>Like the last poster I too took my van on a road trip from Arizona to California for memorial day. At 3500 miles we heard a knock, lost all power and died. After being stranded with our 18month old on the side of the road it was towed to a dealership and we were told the engine was blown. After it was the for 2 weeks getting the small block repaired we drove it home to hear a knock again, our dealer here then had to replace the upper engine (rocker assembly) I have had nothing but a hard time from Chrysler over us being stranded out of state and having to then go back to Cali to get it.

Navigation, Dual DVD's, Swivel Seats, It is unbelievable how much you get for the price. My advice is go to the dealership and hopefully you'll get a smart, knowledgeable, kind salesman as I did. i've had the car for 6 months, yes there have been a few minor problems, but I know that will happen with any new car, not knowing all about it. And with the Lifetime Warranty, I know I can run it until all the interior parts fall apart, which will be a while! I am a Chrysler fan for life!!</TEXT>

Going into this purchase we put a premium on comfort and utility. This purchase was mainly for road trips from Georgia to TX, AZ, and MD. The Honda drove the best and had high comfort but the driver seat was uncomfortable. The Toyota was impressive but expensive and the Flex to small. We rated this van behind the Honda until pricing and entertainment. Chrysler T&C Touring was far better. We paid about 23,700 not including T&T.

<TEXT>My wife and I have had mini-vans for 16 years. We've bought GM & Chrysler and this Town and Country Touring is the best one yet. Great features for the price and good, rugged looks. 6 speed transmission is a big plus. Much better gas-mileage than our 2001 LX with the 3.3 liter. Averaging anywhere from 24-27.9 MPG on the /HYWY. Computer's estimated mpg is off, however - anywhere from 0.7-4 mpg, reliable so far. Power doors are improved over previous models. I am 6'5" and there is plenty of room for me. Love the stow-in-go seats. Can haul most anything. Just fold and forget! SAT radio is great as we live in a rural community. There are some cheep plastic parts but over-all quality is good. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had several problems with the navigation and automatic sliding doors. After several trips to the dealership to fix these issues they replaced the radio and recalibrated both doors. We love the car since these issues have been corrected. The bigger engine is KILLING us in gas. We have the Limited 2008 Durango and a 2007 Corvette. Who ever thought we would see the day where the Vette is by far the best gas mileage. We have spending close to $1,000.00 per month on gas. Thank you BUSH!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the car about 2 1/2 months. We went to Fla. on Vacation. I got 21 mpg at 80+ mph. But coming back I drove slower and tried to see just how much mileage it could get. I got 26.2 mpg from Dothan, Ala to Columbus, Ga. The Car has a great ride. The sound system and the Sirius Sat radio and TV are wonderful. My granddaughter always wants to ride with us. Thanks Chrysler. The only thing I see that might be improved quality wise is the shifter. To me it seems not the quality the rest of the van is</TEXT>

<TEXT>We recently purchased our T&C minivan and I love this vehicle. We ended up using a F&F discount and received a huge discount on the vehicle. Not only do I feel like I got the best minivan on the market, I got it for the best price. I love everything about the vehicle from the exterior style to the interior comfort features. The dual dvd system, sat tv are the best thing one could ever find in a car to keep the little ones quiet. I can now either drive in piece and quiet or listen to whatever I want and the kids can still be happy watching what they want with the headphones. Great feature!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Since day 1 terrible wind noise, transmission does not shift right, van rattles, terrible gas mileage, and have had trouble with the power trunk. Chrysler has done nothing to help. Will not return phone calls or letters. Finally after threating lawsuit or arbitration Chrysler finally agreed to work on the van under warranty. Van has 5500 miles on it. Van is 3 months old. Last Chrysler for me. Owned a 02-05-and 08 models all were new. Buy the Honda or Toyota or you will be sorry.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Returned 2005 Touring edition lease and got 2008 Touring Signature Series. Lease price less for much better vehicle - now have leather heated seats, rear back up camera, dual DVD system. remote start, navigation with Sirius Satellite for 1 year and many more great features. Only concern is the MPG. Last van did 16/17 mpg around town, now getting between 9 and 12 - HELP! Hope this improves. Went on 80 mile road trip to try to improve but the best was 14 mpg. Had slight problem with dual DVD but dealership is replacing. Overall love this vehicle, better bang for buck. Just hope MPG improve.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Chrysler would not even call me. I had to threaten with a law suit or go to arbitration. Finally they called. My van from day 1 has a terrible air leak that comes through the dash I think that is so loud you cannot even hear the radio or talk on a cell phone. Sounds like a train whistle. The transmission is a joke. Gas mileage 20 on the highway with the Cruise on. So in ending if you have to have a van you better go to Honda or Toyota. I have owned 2 1995 Dodge vans and a 2005 and 2002 and this 2008 lemon. Hey Chrysler stick a fork in me I am done with your vehicles and no help at all from you. Y'all just do not care. Thats why your sales are slipping every month. Hope this is helpful .</TEXT>

<TEXT>We really enjoy the swivel & go. It allows you to bring a restaurant on the road. The vehicle is fun to drive. We didn't get electric doors due to price incentives. Wished that it came in a hybrid or diesel for better mileage. Really enjoy the instrumentation on the panel. Allows you monitor your driving and how it affects your mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased this van so we would have a reliable and safe vehicle to drive back and forth to Chicago from South Carolina. Our first trip out, this lovely $40k vehicle lost all power and left us stranded in the Great Smokey Mtns. After being towed to the nearest dealer (70 miles away) we were informed that our engine was BLOWN. Yup - we made it exactly 2000 miles on one engine. Wow - is this a record? Needless to say, we are trying to get Chrysler to buy it back and perhaps get a Honda Odyssey? Maybe our van was just a fluke? Either way, being stranded with a 19 month old for 3 hours on the side of the road is not a good endorsement. Shame on you Chrysler. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchase this 08 Town&Country Limited after test driving the 08 Sienna XLE Limited and 08 Oddyssey Touring. This T&C is by far the best we've seen. We didn't like Oddysey's "Tin can" feel, road noise at highway speeds and the really dated dashboard. The Sienna was a good competitor but lacked swivel & go and SAT TV plus small cargo space and no gadgets. Instruments too looks dated. The T&C has a European feel to it. Turns out it is also the same as the VW Routan. The plush ride, beautiful interior, dual screen + satellite TV makes this van better than our Lincoln Navigator! Chrysler products was never in our radar screen before. This Minivan just blew us away.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>GPS, satellite TV, dual Screen, Swivel and Go seating, $2.99 gas deal, memory seats tied to climate and radio, HID lights. Even my all optioned BMW has less feature than this Town & Country.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>While this car may look nice outside inside it has cheap plastic look and there is barely enough room in third row for adults. But the main problem is its reliability. I've own it for 5 months and already had to be towed 2 times (electrical problem) and one time had radio removed and repaired. Since Chrysler doesn't have loaner cars you will be stuck getting rental car. Also this car only gets about 13 miles per gallon of gas which makes it very expensive to drive nowadays. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This 2008 Limited is our 5th T&C since 1996. It is, by far, the best riding of the bunch. The new 4.0L is MUCH better than the anemic 3.8 was. The gas mileage, although not great, is the same as our 2005's, so I can live with that and the extra 50 hp or so. The Bridgstone tires (on the 17" wheels) are terribly soft sidewalled, so handling is sloppy. Replacements will have lower profile and stiffer walls. The interior is still the best available. No swivel here. We love the stow-and-go. MyGig and Nav are nice improvements too. The light colored seats are just stupid! After 2 days, the driver's seat was dirty. Shifter placement takes getting used to. Overall: Better than previous year.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MyGig! 4.0L engine is big improvement, 6-speed Transmission is smoother, Road noise is lessened, Interior LED lighting, back-up camera is welcomed, Remote start is fun, Still very family friendly. A great value when compared to other 7 passenger vehicles. Gas mileage is acceptable for car this size</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just completed a 1500 mile trip in our 2008 T&C touring edition. This is a well thought out vehicle, with lots of nifty features- mygig, heated power seats, etc. The van handled very well on the (mostly freeway) trip. Good power from the 3.8 V6. The braking is very good. I averaged almost 25 MPG, which is better than I expected to get. That should improve a bit as it gets fully broken in. I think the 6 speed transmission helped with the high "overdrive" gearing. Here's a tip - my Chrysler dealer offered bumper to bumper lifetime warranty for around $2,000. A quick internet search found other Chrysler dealers selling the same thing for $1500 or so.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have not made my first payment yet and it is in the shop for 5 days for a brake issue and when opening my power lift gate I tried to close it and the van thought it was already closed. I had to drive with my lift gate not closed to the closet dealer. I have only heard rave reviews on this new van and the creature comfort won me over. I hope I made the right decision.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ok, so we did just pick this up tonight from the dealership, but I'm in love! We were die-hard import drivers up until now. But seeing how we were hit in a major front end collision last week that totaled our Nissan Quest, we had to find another van quickly with our family of 5 plus pets. So I did my research, asked around when I'd see a T&C driver in a parking lot-and got very positive reviews. We got our Touring edition for the same cost as a stripped down Toyota or Honda!! We've been driving around all night in our new van. The kids LOVE the swivel and go seats & the dual dvd screens! For once they have begged to get in the van! LOL</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the T&C because it was a much better value than the Honda or Toyota models and I liked the look and interior of it a great deal. The gas mileage calculator that is built-in is flawed as I manually calculated it on a recent trip and it was 3 MPG higher. The Mygig system is great and the NAV system is pretty solid. I wish it had traffic updates outside of major cities, but I can live without. The interior is very roomy. The lighting in the van is exceptional. I would recommend this van to anyone. I think the interior is average quality wise - some nice things, but some cheap things as well. But the same is true in most cars - including my Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle makes a bad noise when you stop and turn car off. They stated it's because it's new, well how old does it have to be. The ac makes a whispering noise. The seat in the second seat is very dangerous it goes back to soon and fast. It hurt my niece who is 33 years, it bruised her, can you imagine what it would do to a 5 year. I'm really scared for my grandkids.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Town & Country. I just traded in my 07 Ram pick up for the new 08 Town & Country Touring with Nav and leather. I drive a semi for a living, and get kidded to no end for my owning and driving a mini van. Soccer mom is what they call me! And I ain't a mom! The T&C is a great vehicle. It rides like a Caddy, has more room than my pick up and is fantastic for those trips to Sam's and Costco. We have no kids, but the utility of these vans is incredible! The Stow n Go seating takes the cake. The reason we have a Chrysler. With the seats down, you can put just about anything back there. Home Depot for a sheet of plywood, no sweat! A real mans vehicle!</TEXT>
