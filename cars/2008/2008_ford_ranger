<TEXT>This was my first new vehicle, my first four cylinder, and my first stick shift. I made the right choice. I bought the truck because of what it was, basic, inexpensive, and frugal. The turn signal stalk split at the mold seam at 12,000 miles, but that's not a big deal. It's 2wd but it will make it through deep mud, just don't stop. I've got a K&N filer and a Flowmaster exhaust installed which added very usable low/mid range power. I'm not a Ford guy, I grew up in a GM household. This little truck grows on you, my dad even likes it. Not bad for an old design is it? </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Decent power, ergonomics are spot on, handles curves better than it has a right to. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Style is thick, brawny, efficient and descendant of the bull dog. Basic model does the job on hauling furniture, plants, groceries. wood, sod, bricks. No space is wasted Recommend that you get the electrical windows option; I installed after market windows and remote door locks and wished I had purchased the factory options with Ford. You should also protect your investment and get bedliner with Ford logo. The white paint is beautiful- like porcelein and reflects the 100 degree southern heat. For the low price, a very reliable and satisfactory long term investment. The MPG is really comparable to other 6 cylinder trucks as well as luxury cars! So you are in the ballpark.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Air Conditioning does the job in the closed regular cab-I feel real protected from the heat. The seats are simple grey leather imitation. Seats do not get hot and are roomy enough and solid-does the job like the rest. Close your eyes and you will not know if you are in an SUV or Lexus!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you do the reserch (actual consumer reviews)you will find the Ranger is far more reliable than the Tacoma or Chevy.Just wish it got a few more MPG's.A family member who works for Toyota has told me that Toyota's own internal quality testings show that in recent years Ford cars & trucks beats toyota's hands down!I cary apox. a 1000 pounds of equip.& get 17mpg.I did add a leaf spring. I get 21mpg unloaded.The king cab says it seat 5, lets get real unless its 5 skinny dwarfs you can seat 2 adults comfortablely.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this truck as a second vehicle primarily for haulings stuff w/o ruining my other car. I bought a really stripped down version of it (air and auto only) about 3 mos. ago, and have been really happy with it. The ride is stiff and the transmission is somewhat unrefined, but still this truck was a very economical solution to my needs. While the 4-cyl engine won't win any races, the low end torque enables the engine to come through when I'm really loaded up. The 4-cyl. is noisy, the truck is loose in the rear on wet pavement :), the air conditioning works well, but I have inadvertanly knocked the truck into neutral when reaching for the radio controls (bad layout). I would recommend it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased this truck almost a month ago for an excellent low price! The 4 cyl exceeded my expectations! The truck has plenty of power, handles great, road noise is lower than I expected and interior and exterior is sharp looking. Gas mileage is great! I wish the speakers sounder better, but hey, it's a truck! It also feels great to buy American!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the truck with 3,000 miles on it. I have put 1,000 miles on it. It has the 4.0. That is the fastest 207 horsepower that I have seen! I own 2 other Fords that are still going strong. The gas mileage could be better, but that is nothing. It is probably the best truck that I have owned. I love it, and would highly recomend it. The price was a songcompared to the other truck on the market!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>There seems to be a lot of poor reviews out there for this aging little truck. My questions may be: What is the best selling compact pickup ever? What is the most "bang for the buck" that you can get out of a compact pickup? Believe me when I say that Ford Motor company is not without its reasons for keeping this little truck around. Money, and lots of it! I love my brawny little workhorse! After driving some of the competitor's overpirced products, I found myself with Ford again. People complain about the ride: well, it is actually a truck, not a thimbly little car, with a box, and cab! I can go places with my untouched Ranger that most big trucks wouldn't dare!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I barely get 14-15MPG in the city in the wintertime. Summertime, I can scrape the 18MPG if the A/C isn't on. I have never got anything above 20.5 MPG. I drive with a very very light foot. If I can get 24MPG out of a 4.3L 6cyl GMC pickup, I should be able to do the same with this truck. Vehicle keeps getting leaves in the ductwork, Seriously lacks power, and the A/C is on when you use any setting other than off or vent. Dealer claims it was designed that way. Vehicle still missing a flap in the driver's side fender well. Dealer says it's not supposed to have one. Vehicle has peeling painted masking tape on support in front of the radiator.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great off road. The fx4 upgrade is a good platform to build an off road weekend warroir like mine is. Fits 33x12.5x15 with little rubbing the 3" lift help with tht. Found tht back jump seats pretty much useless unless your verticaly challenged. The 4.10 gears are tourqie and helps me pulls damn near anything. 4.0l motor has tons of power. Chiped mine tho little better fuel mileage that way plus the extra hp didn't hurt. Although my F-150 is better on fuel. Very solid feeling truck. Well built. Upgraded fx4 interior is sharp and functional. Light aregood and bright. Easy to drive and hardly any blind spots. Built Ford tough!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded a two-year old Silverado V6 for my Ranger. The Silverado got 13- 15 mpg and had way too many problems. My little Ranger got 26.3 mpg from the first tank. It just passed the 1500 mile mark, and has yet to get under 25 mpg. It is comfortable, it pulls my utility/motorcycle trailer with ease. It's fun to drive and overall it seems like a good friendly little vehicle that I will have for a long time. Its quality is first rate. Its performance with the little 4 cyl is way better than the Silverado V6. The seats are great, the stereo/sat radio combination is wonderful, and the cruise control works flawlessly. We had a couple of Rangers at work - couldn't hurt them. Great truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My third Ranger so I'm obviously comfortable with them. No problems with this newest. It seems just a little lighter built than my 02 for some reason. Air noise around windows that the dealer couldn't seem to fix. Fuel consuption for the 4.0/auto has been a steady 21 mpg in urban driving. No complaints, just comments. People compliment the Vista Blue color</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was an engineer at Chrysler. My father at GM. I drive for a living. Quality: First USA car with no manufacturing defects. Looks great. Handles Highway: the worst I have ever driven. Printed dangerous handling warning on visor. Best mileage: small 6 with the gas efficient rear end. Best handling: same. Interior: They fired their engineers 30 years ago. I could write pages on their lack of cab engineering. Everything is in the wrong place, works the wrong way, is the wrong size, whatever. E.G. try changing a fuse if you are not an anorexic 8-year old (need flashlight). Try getting groceries out of the back seat. No fan switch off. Center knob: Off(1),vent(1),AC(6).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my latest Ranger for 11 months, now. Averages about 31 MPG on highway trips even going through all of the traffic-jams on I-95 through CT, NY and NJ. My last Ranger was a 1993, which I gave to my son and he is still using it to haul heating-wood. The other brands are more luxurious, but if you need a tough little truck ( not a car with a box stuck on the back) Ford still builds the best. It's probably why the Ranger Plant is staying open, a while longer. Good luck finding another pickup that actually gets over 30 MPG. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the 3.0 liter motor and it's getting 20mpg in town and 25mpg plus on long trips. It's not as strong of the line as my older 4.0 liter was, but the 3.0 is no slouch. The ride is much improved over my older Ranger ( late 90's). The Sirius radio is a must for those long commutes to work. The seats are very comfortable and in general, the truck seems built very well. The 5 speed automatic shifts very easily. This is my third Ranger ( all 99,000 miles + on each) and I hope Ford continues this line in some form as it is a winner </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought a new 08 Ranger XLT Reg. Cab with 4cyl automatic. With the current $3000 rebate, nothing else could come close to the price. Even with GM's employee pricing, a similar equiped Colorado was $1500 more. The chome trim on the XLT and the chrome wheels that my Ranger has make it a sharp looking truck. I couldn't find a used truck that didn't have a ton of miles for much less than I paid for this truck new. With the great gas milage 19 / 24 this truck should do everything I need it to do, which is drive back and forth to work and to haul the occational home project supplies. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Got this little truck last week and it handles great. Nice shifting 5 speed manual, great gas mileage and lots of utility. If you need a reliable truck for everyday hauling and the occasional large item haul this fits the bill perfectly. Solidly built 2.3 liter engine has plenty of power. Sits up high where you can see clearly. The design is dated but still looks great. Ford decided to stop the 3.0 next year. Should have retooled the 3.0 like they put in other vehicles. I think Ford's marketing team needs their heads examined. Instead of tying to sell options, sell trucks with options people want without all the extras people don't want. Can you say plastic wheel covers for $190 or Sirius!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>2.3 fuel efficient engine, solid build, aux input on radio - excellent sound. Highly maneuverable in standard cab form. Nice shifting 5 speed manual. Nice seats, tachometer standard. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought this truck, Red Supercab automatic 2.3L I4 Engine. Traded a Jeep Wrangler 6 speed manual. Have wanted a Ranger for years, finally decide to get one. Only 200 miles so far but I'm pleased with it. Got it for basic commute to work, to get good gas mileage, have more capacity than the jeep to do stuff. Access to supercab area is only gripe I have. Some here critical of ride, this is much better than the Jeep! When I test road I was surprised how smooth it was. For what it is, this is an excellent truck. Ford should keep making it as long as it sells well, it doesn't need "fancy" upgrades when most folks are looking for a good basic truck. I found mine!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sirius radio, way cool. I do have power windows, keyless entry, wipers that wipe once with one push of button. Tire pressure monitor is cool also. ABS brakes also very nice. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have driven 2186 miles and have averaged 20.48 miles per gallon with the AC on all the time in Florida. It's a fun truck to drive. The interior is well designed but, the back cab area is hard to use. If one side of the rear cab area opened the interior of this truck would be perfect. The truck has average power. I don't feel like other drivers are pushing me from red lights and stop signs. I am an average driver, not very agressive and not very slow. The cloth seats and carpet are nice. The steering wheel is positioned very well for long drives. Overall I am very happy with this truck and I am sure that I will keep this truck for a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My third Ford Ranger, a 2008 XLT, upholds the proud tradition of its ancestors. Great mileage 28 MPG. Unbelievably affordable. Unmatched reliability single key turn start in sub zero weather, and I don't have the engine block warmer. Safe in a collision. Low maintenance. Great resale value-try to buy a used Ranger, you might as well just spend the extra $1000-2000 and get a new one. If you need an affordable, low-maintenance, reliable commuter vehicle, the Ranger is it</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>5 speed manual transmission with 1.9L/4 cyl. Great mileage. I have owned 3 Rangers, and had nearly 300,000 miles between them, and had only to replace a single serpentine belt.

<TEXT>I bought a new Ranger this year, spurred on by the crazy rebates Ford offered on this truck earlier in the year. Replaced a 1995 Ranger XLT with over 220,000 trouble-free miles. These are the best small trucks on the road. Funny thing, I drove off the lot paying just $9,800 for a loaded 2008 Ranger XLT. The dealership gave me $2,000 for my 1995 Ranger. What wonderful trucks these are. Ford is making a huge mistake discontinuing the line. Leave it to an American auto company to discontinue the most fuel-efficient line of trucks in production just as gas prices set new records...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was planning to buy a Tacoma but after driving both vehicles and with the rebates and sales incentives from Ford, I got the Ranger and I don't regret it. I got it with the automatic, cruise control, & a sliding rear window. After 2000 miles I am getting 27 mpg on the highway with two passengers and camping gear & I expect the mpg to improve when I put a lid on the bed and as I put more mileage. I like the ride but it rides like a truck. The performance is good but it takes patience driving up mountains. It runs well to excellent on most roads & highways. I get the best mileage when I tach between 2000-3000. I added a Sony FM/AM mp3 CD player with an aux i-pod input & the music sound great</TEXT>

<TEXT>Being the last year of the Ranger I`m glad I ordered one when I did. I`ve been extremely pleased with this vehicle. It works exceptionally well in off-road conditions even with the factory street tires and gets me about 20 MPG on a trip. Regular gas is still the cheapest and it works well to deliver all the power I need.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>One of the features I like most about this little truck is it`s brawny stature. I love the leather seats and the special center console with the subwoofer inside. In addition, servicing this vehicle has been a breeze. Everything is easily accessable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought myself a new 08 Ranger for my birthday. It is the XL Supercab with the 2.3l I4 engine with 5 speed automatic overdrive transmission. I love the torch red color, and I did get A/C, tilt/cruise, stereo with CD player that is MP3 friendly, buddy seats, privacy glass and sliding rear window. I am looking for some good gas mileage and am told that I can get between 24 and 29 mpg on the road after the engine loosens up in 2-3 thousand miles. I love to drive it, it is very quiet, handles predictably with good road feel and steering. This is probably the last year of the Ranger so this truck should keep the Ranger memory alive for many years. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a '03 F150 FX4 SuperCrew Lariat (14.4 MPG). I didn't need 4 doors anymore, and needed better fuel economy. I looked at the Chevy/GMC and Toyota before deciding on the Ranger. I am very satisfied. At 6'3" & 255 lbs, I couldn't fit in the Chevy/GM due to lack of leg/knee room (I have no problem in the Ranger because of dash and console design!) and the Tacoma was too much money. I love the "feel" of the seat - it is firm and comfortable, with a good ride. The 2.3L 4-cyl engine is great for economy, but lacks power IF you have to haul alot of cargo or pull a small trailer with the A/C on! Empty, acceleration and power are fine. I really like the Ranger, despite the small size!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage. Avg 23 MPG on about 60% highway driving through 6000 miles. A/C will erode that a little this summer, though. Comfort of seats is better than power and leather of old Lariat on highway trips! Handling is exceptional, except for the ol' Ranger rear end hop on bad bumps!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I decided on a small truck for ease of parking and economy. To me the Ranger provided the best value by far and the ride was as good as any of the other small trucks. The fit and finish on the new 2008 was equal to and better then the others. I think it is the best looking small truck on the road, and my friends agree. The only downside is the 3.0 motor is not up to competers v6's and the gas mileage is below par </TEXT>

<TEXT>Since delivery the transmission has not functioned properly. It's been to the dealer 4 times in 3500 miles. Upon delivery shift from "R" to "D" and it might take 3 seconds to engage. When it did finally engage it slammed so hard that I thought something might break. Same would happen at a stop light. Dealer's made progress. The big bang's gone, but it still disengages when decelerating at slow speeds so then when you accelerate it bumps back into gear. Rear passenger supercab door is bent and that's why it doesn't close properly. It's again back to the dealer to see if they can fix the tranny and the door. This is my 7th Ford vehicle and the first with any problems. Yuck!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2004 Tremor 2 door Supercab for this 2008 Sport 4 door Supercab because getting to the storage behind the seats was such a pain. The 4 door is the way to go! I also wanted the 4.0 V6 engine this time. The 3.0 in the older truck just didn't have any guts for passing on the highway. The reliability is great, not one trip to the dealer in 60,000 miles w/the first one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Outside mirrors are larger on the 2008 model which helps eliminate blind spots. The 6 c.d. and Sirius radio option is a must also. I'm sorry to read that this may be the last year for the Ranger. That's why I got a new one, just in case Ford stops making them.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 4.0 V6 is impressive. Lots of power but they could have improved the fuel economy. I'd rate the pickup of this truck equal to any small V8. I get about 20 mpg highway. I expect a slight increase when the truck bed cover is installed and I do something about the air intake system ( K&N). This pickup replaced a 05 f150, Interior room took a little getting used to but still its not bad. Mine is the Sport version with a 5 speed. It pulls my 18 foot boat without even struggling.</TEXT>
