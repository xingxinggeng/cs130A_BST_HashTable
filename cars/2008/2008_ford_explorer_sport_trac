<TEXT> Bought the last 2008 adrenalin the dealer had and so far i'm very impressed. Got every option and colorado red paint with 20'' wheels. With only 1000 miles so far I really like the ride and handling of this truck. Its a little underpowered even with the v8 ( maybe thats because my other car is a z28 with an LT1) It looks alot faster than it is. A great looking truck that has everyone asking "what model is that ??,,"did it come new like that?". Smooth as silk ride and drive with decent milege from a 4500lb truck (16.9 mpg so far) definately a head turner. At 46 ive had a lot of cars and this one is up top of the list.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE> the SYNC cool and love the adrenalin package</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got a fantastic deal on the adrenalin model at Christmas. Had Acuras since 1989, but they were not motivated to sell me a vehicle. Brand loyalty meant nothing to them. We enjoy sitting higher when driving. This truck provides a tremendous sense of security in winter driving situations. The 6-speed tranny is smooth and the V8 is very flexible. The independent rear suspension gives a much more impressive ride over rough roads compared to the Chevy Silverado I rented last year for a weekend. Fuel economy so far is acceptable at 15-20 mpg in winter driving. I'm expecting a seasonal improvement to 20-26 mpg when the weather warms up, like my Acura TL does. We enjoy driving this truck immensely. Recommend just adding sunny days and a favourite recreational activity. This truck has style, power and tremendous versatility. Big grins. It's a keeper.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had my Trac since August, have loved it so far. Had a Focus before this so there was a little bit of an adjustment period but it's all been good. Love the rubberized floor. It's a breeze to clean. Could have done a lot better with the MPG though </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The rubberized floor on the inside makes it a snap to clean after snow or if you were out in the mud. The bed even though on the small side has held up very well with all the stuff I toss into it</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What in the heck are they thinking in Detroit? Ford has been making trucks for well on 100 years. This is the most uncomfortable truck I have ever been in. This truck is provided as a work vehicle and I hate to get in the thing. The YukonXL I was in previously was by far a more comfortable, good riding truck. This SUV, while being a smaller body, has no excuse not to have a more comfortable and well designed seat at least. Then add the cheap cheap leather, and interior which looks like its a year old already, and I can see why the big three reps apologized for building cheap cars. This wasn't cheap, but it sure is built that way. Fit and finish? What a joke. Never again Ford. Never.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I couldn't resist buying a brand new showroom leftover Adrenalin & taking advantage of Ford employee discounts. Traded in a 05 Silverado SE Special Edition Extended Cab and there's simply no comparison in quality - Ford wins hands down. The ride is tops, the look is...well, the Adrenalin turns heads everywhere I've gone. Definitely buy the Navigation option with Sync. Makes a world of difference. Black interior is nice but I would've enjoyed a two-color treatment. Still, this car/truck combination is versatile, sporty, smooth, cool & a real winner. Might be the best vehicle I've ever owned - and I've had many.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation, smooth ride, ground effects treatment, sunroof, power rear window & 20" wheels (it could also easily handle 22"). I like the full four door cab plus the advantage of a pickup bed, even if a short one.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have this vehcle about a month and thus far it is great. The Sport Trac seems the perfect fit as I wanted something between a full size pick up and a compact. The bed's a little small but still capable of hauling 4x8 sheets when fitted with a couple 2x4 in the notches in the bed. The interior is roomy and comfortable. Not extravagant but I am still satisfied. MPG could be improved, so far getting 16mpg but would prefer if Ford could up that to 20. The V6 has been adequate and the 5 speed auto is smooth. satelite radio is nice. The molded bed w/ compartments and tiedowns is well designed. Overall look is very appealing. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the overall appearance as well as the interior room. Versatlity of having the bed is nice. Satellite radio is nice, rides good. Dark blue is nice color. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was a Ford hater and never would have considered buying one. I was initially looking at the Avalanche and while reading reviews I noticed some positive ones for the SportTrac. I went to the dealership and was also looking at the Expedition, but they could not get me the numbers I wanted so I decided to try out the SportTrac. I took a drive in it and was amazed at how well it drove. It's quiet, smooth, and the V-8 has plenty of go in it. So far I have had it for two months and it's been perfect. My mileage has been about 15-16 overall, but that is mostly because I tend to have a little fun now and then. It's the same mileage my CX-7 got and that thing didn't have anywhere near the room.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V-8, tires, smooth suspension, rugged yet sophisticated looks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2004 F-150 and got 2008 Limited Sort Trac, V8, 4X4, limited chrome and electronics. Ford couldn't have done a better job of putting a vehicle together. Great power anywhere you need it, I am am happy with my mileage compared to my F-150 V8 5.4. Getting 22mph on highway. Very smooth ride, If you're looking for something like this no other manufacturer can even come close to the quality and comfort of the Sport Trac.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bed cover, 6 speed trans,18" standard tires on Limited. In bed storage boxes.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I will always need some type of truck for hauling and have liked the Sport Trac since the first ones came out. The addition of the V8 and IRS on the latest model was the clincher. Truck has a very comfortable interior. Outstanding ride and handling. I love the excellent overall quality, it is very quiet with no rattles or squeaks. For someone that does not a 6' or 8' bed length, this truck fits the bill. Tows a 5000 boat very nice and with the traction control, goes up the slipperest ramp with ease. With the sales incentives and rebates, the price simply cant be beat for a fun full featured, loaded 4 door truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V8 power, Sync and overall styling</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had read a lot of reviews before I made a purchase. Allow me to say Ford had done a great job. I put black leather in this vehicle as well. Sync and convenience pack came with it along with the tow. First, I drove the kids to see family 3 hours away and it drove smooth. The passing issue with power-hey guys turn the OD switch off , that will give you more power, not that I had a problem. No carpet. Excellent, easier maintenance. Plastic inside. Great. Now I dont have to use "Armor All"-easy to clean with warm water. A sync syst-with Sirius. Let's roll! A class 3 tow package-take the jet skis to the lake up to 5000lbs w/ elec. Come on! Gas, Ford could do better. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync. No hands to talk. Tow. Great idea! Quality tires and suspension looks great with durability. 6 airbags, appreciate the safety you guys put into it. Good call! I think the cover idea is great and the options in the bed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the vehicle out of necessity. We just had a new baby and needed bigger trunk space. Unfortunately, I traded quality for price and ended up paying for it in the end. Good power in the lower gears, so, you'll get going pretty quickly, but then the power drops off quickly once you get into the upper gears. I always had an extremely hard time passing anyone above 50MPH without hammering down the gas pedal. A lot of plastic interior, comfortable seats for short drives, but horrible on your lower back on drives of 3 hours or more. SYNC feature is horrible! Even speaking slowly and clearly, I'd have to repeat myself 2-3 times for the system to recognize what I was trying to say.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice exterior body style. Tonneau cover is excellent </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had many vehicles, of all sorts. I have been looking at the Sport Trac since it's debut in 2001, but wanted more than the 4.0 litre engine. Now with the V8 4.6 my dream truck is a reality, and the wait was worth it, more robust frame & suspension (IRS), better looks, plus overall refinements. I am over 6'1", comfort is great. I like the door handles (placement, appearance) and have no issue with the door pulls, seats, or anything else. The rubber floor covering is much easier to clean than carpet would be. I trailer two large ATVs at "highway speeds", passing & handling is spot on. I am very pleased with my Sport Trac, and have recommended it to others, friends and family included.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The composite box with the three in floor storage compartments plus lockable tonneau cover and tailgate. The 2" receiver hitch, with 4 & 7 wire connections. Interior comfort and storage, also flat folding rear seats are the best. There is nothing to dislike about the 2008 Sport Trac 4x4 IMHO</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had lots of Fords over the years but this is one of the best. I traded a 2004 F150 Crew for this and I am as pleased as punch. The 4.6 V8 is a power house and delivers basicly the same mpg as the 6. It is so easy to park, garage friendly (takes less room) is great on the road. It is quiet, ride is outstanding, no need for rails as in and out access is great. The new Sync by Microsoft and sirus radio makes it a intertainment wonder. No need for cds as one 2mb in the usb will access hundreds of songs with out worry of storage or scratching of cd. The vinyl floor is padded and the cab is quiet. It is a well thought out suv and with current offer of 4000 cash back is a must have.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync! Sirius radio, v8 engine, and quality of product. Standard features and safety features are truly outstanding.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 2008 Explorer pick-up is perfect for me and my high school aged daughter. I cannot complain about one thing other than gas mileage on the V6. I guess I would have purchased the V8 just to get the six speed transmission if I knew the mileage would not be all that different, although, my five speed seems fine for my purposes and the eight cylinder just added to the cost. My leather interior, the paint and trim are outstanding. Microsoft Sync and Sirius radio combined with the 6 disc changer gives me so much music through the truck's killer sound system that I don't know quite what to listne to sometimes. I love the handling, et. al. Really neat truck for a city boy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Sport Trac is a great truck/SUV! It's great for everyone including familys. This thing has so many features that I don't know where to start. My Kids love it and my wife perfers to drive it over her Mustang and Audi! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync is great! Especially with MP3 players. Windshield defroster works great! My neighbors and I usually compete to see who's windshield clears up first... and now I don't have to scrape my windshield!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded an '05 Sport Trac 4.0 V6. The '08 w/ 4.6LV8 is far superior and fuel economy is 1 mpg less in town than the 6; same on hi-way. The ride is like that of a much more expensive truck and the handling and noise levels are top-notch. Sync system can be a problem at times (mine has gotten stuck in a RING cycle that forced me to pull over, shut everything down and re-start the car. Rear seat legroom is improved over previous model too. This truck is a sleeper, and Manf incentives are great; better check it out! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V8 Engine, satellite radio, build quality that is on par with imports.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned my V6 XLT for three months and I have been very happy with my purchase. I don't need to haul large or heavy objects very often, so the small bed works for me. The ride is comfortable and composed. The V6 has plenty of power and everything has been reliable. Ford needs to work on the fuel economy. I am not dissappointed with the mileage, but I think Ford could do better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my '97 Ford F-150, which was the best vehicle I had ever owned. Needed more family room though. Drive alot off road so needed a 4WD. The dealer installed skid plates from Ford and 265/70R17 BF Goodrich Longtrail tires. Lifts the vehicle over an inch vs. stock tires. Truck drives like a luxury ride on the road and has handled real off road trails here in Arizona desert thus far with no problems. It is not the tallest frame for a 4WD, but take it careful and the truck will climb anywhere. Mileage is okay at 18.5 mpg on highway, and 16.5 city. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior design and hard tonneau cover with bed extender are both awesome. Very quiet and smooth ride. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I came out of a 2003 4x4 F250 w/ the V10. I loved th truck but needed a vehicle with a lower payment and lower fuel bill. The Sport Trac did both. I have really enjoyed the ST. I think the 4.0 v6 handles it better than the 4.6 v8 handles the F150. Fuel mileage is avg. about 17, and, with the tailgate down, my Honda Foreman 4wheeler will fit in the back(the side tie downs come in very handy for this. Would definately recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior and interior design. Center console mounted shifter, very quiet ride.</FAVORITE>
