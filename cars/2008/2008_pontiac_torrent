<TEXT>I have been a sedan or coupe driver all my life, I also build and drive street rods, but this torrent is the most fun vehicle I have ever owned. I always am looking for an excuse to go somewhere. I have looked at other vehicles and it seems to me that this car offers a lot more goodies for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT> Just read the news about Pontiac perhaps going good bye. Sad but this Pontiac Torrent is a rock solid performer and for good value. It is said GM always stops building a car when they got it right. I echo most of the comments above. This is a fun to drive vehicle and handles well for the 3.4L Minor gripes: the cupholder window control, Perhaps a luggage rack bar on top as standard. Back seat room is far superior to all other midsize SUVs. The only problem? My 20 year old daughter now "claims" it as her primary driving vehicle! But such is life when you teach children how to help pick a car( she picked it). But I have fun on my commute motorcycle</TEXT>

<TEXT>Actually owned it's cousin the Chevrolet Equinox for 4 years. I love that car. So much so I added a Torrent to the stable. The Equinox and Torrent are fun to drive and I have had zero problems. A little over 20 in the city and 24-26 on the highway MPG. The moving Rear seat is my favorite feature, but the performance of the engine and transmission is as good as the Mercedes I once owned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Huge rear seat legroom. Fun to drive. Looks good. I think it's very well built.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love the car. Getting in and out is great, the interior is very roomy. Hate the cup holders. I dropped my keys in the open space and it took me an hour to get them out between the seat and the open space. Wish I knew something I could get to replace the cup holders. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I would recommend this vehicle to anyone who is thinking about getting an SUV. This is my first SUV and I love the look and comfort of it. XM radio in the vehicle is a great feature that I can't believe I lived with out before. This is a very roomy vehicle, yet still very sporty looking.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM radio! There is something for everyone on XM. Also the space in the vehicle you can move so much in there.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my '08 Torrent GXP about a month ago. It is Carbon Black. Mine came fully loaded with DVD entertainment system which included a pair of Panasonic wireless headphones. It also has OnStar and XM raidio. The sound system sounds great and movies really rock coming out of the cars speakers. The wireless headphones sound great and are much much better than I thought they would be. I really like how the 60/40 rear seat can slide almost 8 in. I must say the GXP's 264 hp engine really delivers.It gives you plenty of get up and go and lots of power to tow. I drove mine through the Rocky Mtns towing over 3000 lbs and had no problem on the very steep grades. This is my first SUV and I love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a very good riding cross over type SUV. It gets very good gas mileage on the highway - about 25 to 26. The controls are pretty good, but the steering and handling on the base model is unacceptably sloppy. If you like this vehicle, get the GXP model which has a different and tighter steering system. The center console could be a lot better and more useful - it lacks storage and the center mounted power window buttons are not intuitive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM Radio; good gas mileage; comfortable ride. Sight and sound package (stereo upgrade and sunroof)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just brought this baby home and I'm smitten. I test drove several SUVs over Labor Day weekend (the 2008s were priced to move). I didn't even know that Pontiac had a crossover (I was familiar with the Equinox, which is the same vehicle). I was about to pull the Trigger on a Santa Fe, which actually had a nicer interior with more storage, but once I test drove the Pontiac, I was sold. The 3.4 L pulls that rig right up to speed with no problem, and the handling was tight like a sports sedan. Compared to the Santa Fe and the Escape, the Torrent won on performance alone (and good looks). Also, I averaged 26 MPG on the 120 mile freeway drive home. Not bad for a big vehicle like this.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Pontiac grille, performance, ride, handling, AUX input jack, and my favorite: The beautiful two-tone interior (black and tan). The driver information center, with trip computer is nice. Being able to check my exact tire pressure from inside the car, while driving. Great gas mileage too!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The vehicle replaced a leased 2005 GMC EnvoyXL SLT. Though the Envoy was loaded the Torrent has plenty of features and is fun to drive. I pulled my boat 500 miles with no problem and the mileage is about 20% better than the Envoy. The Torrent is fun to drive, don't believe the reviews about it being "mushy" etc. The 3.4 V6 has plenty of spunk. The vehicle performs very well in town and on the highway. Highway mileage is about 25 and city is about 18. Plenty of room inside for 4 adults for long distance and 5 adults is not problem for shorter drives, rear seating has amazing leg room and front seat passenger seat has more room than the Envoy. We added the chrome package and leather.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mileage for an SUV is very good. Tows up to 3500 lbs, much more than other crossovers. Smooth ride. Handles like a car, not a truck.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What can I say. Black on black with 17 in. Wheels and it sexy looking as well as fun to drive. I opted for the 3.4, the 3.8 must be incredible! Love the onstar! Now if they could give us better front cup holders? When you take off, the 5 speed trans is so smooth! Watch it. You'll get speeding tickets! Gave up my stow & go Chrysler Town & Country and have no regrets!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Torrent is a great little SUV for women. Enough space to carry just about anything, but handles like a compact, that fabulous Pontiac power steering and transmission. Pontiac is the true signature American car; sharp style at first glance, muscle when you need it, smooth ride, fun and always dependable. I have done weekend driving with the Murano and the Jeep Liberty and the Torrent beats both no contest. It has all the classic benefits of a Pontiac: fast start, stylish interior and exterior, affordable price (at $26,000 it is $12,000 cheaper than the Murano) and great on gas. I get 27 miles to the gallon, and it only takes $61.00 to fill up the tank. I love this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks expensive though it's affordable, a SUV that handles like a fun car, 27 mpg, comfortable seats and plenty of back seat room, 0-60 in 5 seconds, pretty teal color, space for my purse next to the driver's seat, great sound system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in my GMC Yukon for this Pontiac because of high gas prices. Though I would have to settle for less of a vehicle to save gas but I was wrong. Torrent is solid and is fun to drive. Tows my camper with no problem. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Car looks great; mines a dark red, looks classy. Interior comfortable and stylish. Plenty of room, wife likes the grocery net in the back, place for her purse under the center console. Reclining back seat and leg room awesome for an SUV of this size.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Four months, 7,000 miles (about 70/30 highway/local) 22.7 mpg, same as my '02 Santa Fe 4cyl, but much peppier and roomier. This SUV is fun to drive, has enough horsepower to carry 4 good size (and then some) people without dragging its feet, and handles very well. Even though it has lots of room inside, it's not a huge land barge like the Escalade. My friend bought a Ford Explorer and his 15 mpg is killing him. I've always had good luck with Pontiacs, and this looks like another winner.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Spare tire is in the car, not hung under the chassis like my Santa Fe. Power is more than adequate. Fore and aft back seat adjustment is great. Onboard diagnostics alert me to problems. The car send me monthly e- mail reports on critical system status.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Happy with the purchase of my 2008 GXP over all. My wife tells me it's good for grocery shopping. It?s comfortable to drive and has a good driving height for visibility. No problems driving in rain. Nice looking vehicle. Lots of room to carry all our stuff. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent power for passing and getting in and out of traffic. Good handling vehicle. Movable back seat has been handy, especially with Child's seat in the back. Even though the controls are different I'm liking them. Good heating and ventilation. On star is handy and XM radio is enjoyable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Every Torrent owner I have talked to really likes their vehicle. This GXP is really fast and handles like a sports car. It is so neutral in the corners. When you expect the front end to push, it just digs in & goes round. I am at over 22 mpg now. It has great utility to boot. If you are looking for a vehicle like this, you really owe it to yourself to give it a try. I know of Honda owners who don't get but a 1mpg more in their smaller CR-V and no fun factor at all. Even Scions only get about 23.5 & are slower than molasses. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded up from a Vibe with 90,000 miles. That little car cost me almost nothing. I miss the Change holder, fuel door lock, always on headlights, and most of all the cover for the storage area. This is especially important for me since I am on the road a lot and my car is in a Motel Parking lot overnight. The car is only 48 hours old and already has 600 miles on it. I hope it is as reliable as the Vibe. It is a solid car, drives well, and maybe someday I will figure out how to program the radio.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had the Equinox LS for the past four years and had no real complaints. I know I've only owned the Torrent for a few weeks and its new, however the ride, handling, and style is superior over the Equinox. I would have gone for the new Vue however the cost to lease is unreal. I agree 100% with a lot of the other writers on the quirks based on my experience with the Equinox, but the Torrent is such a better upgrade. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dash layout, room and space, no middle hump in the back sliding back seat. Great ride and handling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Torrent. I went from a little Neon to the Torrent and what a difference. I love sitting up high, it is very comfortable, I love that there is room for my purse (in the middle), it rides very nice and I just LOVE it! My boyfriend loves driving it as well because he has plenty of leg and head room. It has an excellent stereo.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite thing about my Torrent would be the room that it has. There is so much room in it. I also love that I have room for my purse right next to me instead of putting it in the back or on the floor. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So nice, so tight. Moves as one unit. No squeeks, no rattle, just solid build. Quiet, with a nice tech sound to the engine. Everything high technology. Seats firm and fitting. Sit high and command a view of the road. About 26 mpg on the road at 65. 55 gets you 28</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Radio is terrific and XM fun. OnStar a nice backup insurance. Big load capacity. Golf clubs, carts, everything else, still roomy. And my favorite: 5 year warranty</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I previously owned a 1998 Old's Bravada and a 2007 Mazda CX9. All of my vehicles have their pluses and minues but I really like the Torrent. The biggest problem I have is with is with the interior design on the Torrent. The cup holders are virtually worthless to use. The stereo system is excellent. The handling affects out on the road are very good - just hope the gas mileage gets better. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This will be the third crossover vehicle I have owned the other 2 being Subaru Outbacks a 1997 and a 2002. The Pontiac has it all over them. More power, more room, better styling, better fuel economy all with a lower price tag. The interior on the Pontiac Torrent is very roomy, comfortable and well laid out. Cargo space is huge and versitile because of the sliding rear seat. Fit and finish is outstanding both inside and out. Power from the standard 3.4L V6 is impressive and the 5 speed automatic transmission is smooth shifting and the rest of the drivetrain is also smooth and quiet. Handling, braking and ride quality are top notch as good as I have experienced in vehicles costing much more.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My husband went on and on about seeing this beautiful vehicle, so we went to test drive it. As soon as I got in and adjusted the seats and realized that I would never again need a pillow to get close enough to the steering wheel, I was in love. And then to top things off,I finally had a place to store my huge purse; the center console lifts up to hold a purse or anything else. And then you can fold the center back down again. For a woman who pays a lot of money for purses, I never have to throw it on the floor, or the back seat, I can have it next to me but neatly stored. Someone was really thinking there. Thank you!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one fast little SUV. The six speed auto tranny helps with fuel enconomy while not hurting performance. The manual mode of the transmission has about a 1 second lag between the time you shift up or down to the time it actually does it. Seats are very comfortable over a long trip. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Outstanding space utilization. Back seat is exceptionally roomy. Flat floor. Great fold down rear seat operation. Folds flat with one hand and misses front seats with room to spare. Relatively light (3800 lbs.) for an SUV with this much room. Tows well with 2500 lb. U haul. Rich exterior appearance (silver with 17 inch wheels). Satisfied with build quality.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior space efficiency. XM radio is very entertaining on long trips. OnStar turn by turn navigation an unexpected plus. Fuel economy ranges from 21 to 26. Have touched 30 mpg for long highway stretches at 60 mph. Very satisfied. Towing package includes great wiring connector.</FAVORITE>
