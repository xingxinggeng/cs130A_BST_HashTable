<TEXT>I have huge mixed feelings about the Nissan product. I love the styling and the power, but there is no doubt about it, my Armada is a piece of crap. It must have been built on a Friday when everyone wanted to go home. Within the 1st year of ownership, the brakes squealed horrendously, the radiator had to be replaced because it was cracked, the rearview mirrors would not adjust upward, the transmission would shift roughly, the steering would shake while braking, and the list goes on. It took 6 trips to the dealership to finally convince them the radiator needed replaced. Now, there is a loud rattle when accelerating, the car needs a front- end alignment, and I'm stuck because of the economy</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The styling and power. I love the liftgate and back up camera.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have purchased Nissans exclusively since the 1980s. Always reliable and sporty. Now that we have three young children, we found are 7 passenger 2005 Pathfinder to be too small for our needs. With gas at the time of purchase hovering around $2.80 a gallon, I was concerned about making the move to the Armada. Well, after a year, we couldn't be happier with our Armada. I was always drawn to the muscular exterior styling, but was never keen on the interior. Nissan did a great job with the interior makeover of the 2008 Armada. The quality of the leather seats is improved, the layout is logical, and all of the buttons feel solid. The information screen is really helpful. And we average 15mpg!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the space! Being able to watch DVDs on the information screen while docked! The power lift gate is helpful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After shopping SUVs for months I could not find anything that offered everything with power and room to spare. This is simply my favorite vehicle ever. It handles like a small car, is as quick as a sports car, has the room of a full size van with accessibility, all the technology a guy could ever ask for for a reasonable price. The mileage is to be expected for a vehicle like this. I just can't get over how satisfied I am with this vehicle. I pull a trailer with a Diesel powered pickup and this SUV is not far behind on it's towing prowess. I want to buy another one before they quit making them!</TEXT>

<TEXT>16,000 miles later and we remain quite impressed overall. The gas mileage average to date is 14.8. A few issues required a trip back to the dealer (rt ft strut blown, bad coolant cap leaking), but everything has been resolved to our satisfaction. One quality note: the alignment from the factory was awful! The truck darted around over bumps and handled horribly at first. I performed an alignment myself. It made a HUGE difference in the truck's composure! The front AND rear suspension is adjustable. Request that all be adjusted and get a final printout! The Armada serves our needs to a "T". I have no reservations in recommending it to anyone needing a large SUV!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Strong and responsive powertrain (this thing flat out rolls on demand!), good balance between ride and handling, Bose sound/XM, good overall interior design and comfort, multi function computer has handy features and information.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought this last week and we traded in a 1997 Nissan Quest with 135000 miles and never had it in the shop so we bought another Nissan product. This truck is the bomb and it gets 16.5 with a K&N air filter around town and 19.5 on the hwy, so if your looking for a great big SUV this is the Truck. Our old van only got 16 in city and 21 on the hwy so there's not much difference in the fuel economy, and the power is awesome with the 5.6 liter V-8 engine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this used with the intention to buy a new Chevy SUV, but after owning an Altima for 8 years and putting 175000 miles with no problems. I had to test drive the Armada so we did and liked it much better than the Chevy Tahoe. I have three kids and they have all the room in the world to move around and we are getting ready to buy a new camper so the towing cap. was very important to us. We get about 15 miles to a gal in the city with the k&n filter in it . We love this SUV. If you're looking for a dependable truck this is it. We will drive this one for ten years and put 200000 miles before we need to buy another. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I cannot believe how I have grown to depend on this car both summer and winter. I bought it for a winter vehicle but we have used it to tow our 20 ft travel trailer and it pulls so much better than our truck! It is so comfy for my 6 foot frame that I like to drive my car everywhere instead of being the passenger in another car! I love the way it handles and I feel the safest I have ever felt when driving a vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased my new Nissan Armada a little less than two months ago and I've already had it back at the dealership for service 4 times! I'm a little disappointed because I love this vehicle and my husband it now wishing we would have stuck to a Chevy or Ford! I have had the sound system already replaced because the back four speakers never worked, the sunroof worked on because of the loud rattling noise it made as you drove down the road and it had only been opened twice and I've also had problems with my windshield wipers/washers and it's not even due for the first oil change yet! This is my first Nissan and they have yet to prove to me what they stand for!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had an Expedition and decided to go smaller so I went with a BMW X5. What was I thinking? Had the BMW literally for 10 months and researched full size SUVs. The powerful Armada has been hands down the best SUV that I have ever driven. It's driving performance is incomparable to any other ride out there. My Expedition had a ridiculous amount of play in the steering wheel and such a narrow wheel base that I felt as if I would flip over. With the Armada you get an extra wide wheel base and can turn on a dime. I thought that parking this beast might be an issue but watching my passengers freak out when I whip into a parking space without any problems is a great testimony to its control.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear camera great for hooking up the boat trailer. Love the power lift gate and auto sensors. Amazing towing capacity and power. Towed our boat (a 6,000 lb Wellcraft cabin cruiser) 300 miles and couldn't even tell it was behind us.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my Armada as a replacement family car. What a vehicle! This is the 8th Nissan I've owned since my first in 1983 that I put 250,000 miles on with 0 problems aside from normal wear & tear. Nissan rivals any competitor in quality for less $$$. I priced a comparably equipped 08 Toyota Sequoia and literally $10,000.00 later, well you do the math. I own a 91 Toyota 4runner and I like it, that's what made me take a look at the Sequoia but for the money, I just couldn't justify purchasing it over the Armada. I think the Armada looks better as well. Excellent power, 9,000lbs towing, wonderful interior and instrumentation, roomy and very comfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I changed my 2004 Suburban for a 2008 Nissan Armada (LE). My Armada is 6 months old and we are very happy with it. The only thing is that I should have paid more attention to the reviews I had read about the Armada not being stable on the road. If you drive the Armada even at 40 miles the truck loses control. The other day I got very scared because I was doing 60 on the freeway and the pavement is not smooth in some places and I just lost control, the good thing is that I had both hands on the steering wheel. At this point I'm very concerned for the safety of my kids. Please test drive on not so smooth pavement!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had our Armada for two weeks and really are enjoying it. It has everything needed in a large SUV power, refinement, safety features, and roominess. The mileage is low but, it is a fair tradeoff for the excellent utility and to have the family in a large, safe vehicle. The Armada blew away the domestic SUV's in interior materials quality and features, especially for the price. Nissan really did their homework with this vehicle and it shows.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After some long thought I chose the Armada over a Tahoe. After owning a week I wonder why I ever cosidered a Tahoe. Fully loaded this baby comes with options that would have cost $5000 more than a Tahoe. Everything fits perfect, rides better than our Suburban, has more power. My only problem is why I did not buy one sooner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We replaced an '03 Expedition. We went with the Nissan because we could get it equipped pretty much exactly the way we wanted it. Almost a thousand miles later we have really fallen for this truck. A few quibbles so far would be only a couple of interior fit issues and a booming noise in gear at idle. I would complain about the gas mileage, but that would be pointless! You get what you get in MPG when you buy a behemoth like this (I rated comparable economy). With three kids, frequent family trips and a boat that gets used nearly every weekend in the summer this quickly becomes the ultimate family vehicle!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Put 180k miles on a Pathfinder without ever having one major issue in 10 yrs. Nissan reliability is simply amazing. More than a quarter of those miles were in 4x4 mode on dirt and snow covered roads living in Colorado. After test driving several other large SUVs, I couldn't find anything that was comparable in terms of ride and extras. The engine has good torque for driving up steep grades while carring several people and loads of ski gear. The extra leg room in the back makes for a very comfortable ride for everyone on long road trips. I plan on having this vehicle for a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Outgrew the Pathfinder that we purchased a couple of years ago and decided to get an Armada. We purchased a loaded SE, since the LEs that we found all had the captains chair package. The Armada drives nicely, is comfortable and roomy, and gives you plenty of cargo space. Gas mileage is what it is but that's easily overlooked when you think of how versatile this SUV is. The wife loves it, the kids love it, and I really like it due to its size.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Loved our Pathfinder and love our Armada. The ride is fantastic and fit and finish is far above all American competitors. Turning radius is great too. 7 inch LCD in dashboard is very functional and nice looking. 2nd row leg room and comfort is superb in Armada. Drove 200 miles all freeway and got just over 16 mpg so not bad. Lots of power to spare with the v-8. Got a nissan extended warranty when purchased. Will help ensure investment is protected (should not need to use it though).</TEXT>

<TEXT>We needed something to tow our boat and 6 months ago we picked up an 07 5.7l Tundra CM. Overall the Tundra was a good truck, but i was disapointed with it and just didn't like driving it. We looked at the new Sequoia but I was again disapointed with the bland styling and plastic Tundra interior :(. We happened to stumble into the Nissan dealer and i was very surprised with the Infiniti-like interior in the 08 Armada. We LOVE our new Armada... rides great, tons of towing power, comfy, and lots of great technology.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased a loaded 08 4x4 turning in a 05 Pathfinder. I bought this vehicle on the last day of the month and netted over 10,000 off sticker with the 4500 rebate. We love the truck so far, the navigation works great as does the vehicle's voice command. Wish the sound system had an integrated iPod adapter but I can live with this. Drive is smooth and quiet and the handling is super. Exterior looks hot with the 20" wheels and the new interior is far superior to the prior years.</TEXT>

The new truck is a smoother ride than the 04, but I liked the stiffness of the 04 when it comes to hard cornering. The power lift gate is the bomb!!! I had 60K on my 04 without any major problems.

<TEXT>We have only owned the 2008 Armada for a couple of days, but we love it. Yes the fuel economy isn't the best, but I think it is worth it to put my children into larger safer vehicle. You could buy a smaller SUV that will get about 20 MPG as compared to the Armada (that averages 13 MPG). I drive about 15,000 miles a year and only pay about an average of 100 per month more then I would with a smaller SUV. I have a lot of room and it is very comfortable. A real head turner.

<TEXT>I looked around for an SUV/minivan that would provide a safe, comfortable ride for my family of 5. I narrowed down to the Infiniti QX56, the GMC Yukon Denali and the Armada. When compared side by side, there was no question... the Armada won. The legroom and comfort are incredible. The fuel economy leaves a little to be desired, but it is a huge SUV! I am 6'8" tall and with the driver's seat all the way back, I can easily sit behind the driver. No other vehicle found had that much rear legroom. Bells and whistles galore plus it looks great!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Needed to tow horses. Looked at the Suburban, Expedition, etc. The Armada had more standard safety features and more convienence features than the others. Second row legroom beats any other SUV (by far), and the nav/voice system is best on the market. However two areas could be improved: 1) the suspensions "shudders" when driving over broken pavement. 2) the seats aren't very supportive - although the truck has little body roll, the unsupportive seats magnify this effect. I'm fortunate enough to have owned LX 470s, RRs and G500s and I still find myself driving the Armada most of the time. If you prefer a "richer" environment, consider the QX56.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We love our new Armada!! We have only had it a few days but so far it is the most smooth, comfortable ride. I traded my Isuzu Ascender (which I loved by the way) and was a bit unsure that the Armada could live up to the expectations that I had. Once my husband and I, who are both very tall, sat in the middle and back seats, we were sold. It is so roomy and comfortable to ride in and to drive. It doesn't have the best gas mileage but luckily I work very close to home and all the room makes up for it. My 2 sons love that feature also, as they can each have their own row of seats with lots of room and they feel very safe riding in it. I hope we love it as much in 5 years as we do today!!</TEXT>

Gas is good while traveling, but not in the city. I'm still glad I purchased one. For a big vehicle I don't have any blind spots b/c of the design of the vehicle and big mirrors.

Bluetooth works better than any of my previous models, including Motorola factory bluetooth. Voice recognition can control heat / cool, radio, and phone.

<TEXT>We purchased this car because both my husband and I are 6'4'' and we have a baby who needs to be seated in the center. This is the only car that allows us both leg and head room and PLENTY of room for other passengers to sit and be comfy. We have our seats all the way back and still have plenty of room in the second row. We also love the front sensors and the rear view camera, nav system and the new touch panel display radio system. The hatch and third row move with the push of a button and the ride is smoother then a Cadi without a doubt! You will LOVE this car. </TEXT>
