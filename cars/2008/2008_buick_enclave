<TEXT>Great car on the highway. Very quiet. The driving around town in moderate traffic can cause frustration with the lack of response when the gas peddle is depressed while traveling at speeds in the 25-35 mph range. Sometimes depending on the gear you are in you may not get much of a response initially unless you really press hard. Sometimes it will downshift and the rpms can shoot to over 5000 when all you wanted to do was go around a slightly slower car. Can be difficult at times.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet ride, Bose stereo, interior room, overall exterior design. Great looking car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great car. We have had the car for 18 months now and have been very satisfied with everything except the rear visibility. Unfortunately the blind spot to the rear on both the passenger and drivers side make it a little nerve racking to drive in traffic. The DVD monitor also blocks the Rearview mirror</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great entertainment system</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I find this to be a very good car. It is roomy, comfortable, and classy-looking. I can't understand why certain consumer magazines don't give this a thumbs up. I liked the fact that someone from the GM shop floor rang me to see how I liked it. This is a great American car - we're proud to have it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We like the quiet ride, 3 rows of seats with automatic liftgate, and dual A/C. The standard shift feature is fun to use around town. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Waited until we had owned for a year before writing a review. Our Enclave is the nicest vehicle I've ever owned. My first American car ('75 Chevy Monte Carlo) was also my last because it was junk. Bought my first import new ('87 Honda Accord), have disparaged American cars since. Then I had the Enclave Experience. What a great American car! I was actually proud to be able to buy and recommend an American car. We use it primarily for long trips, and have spent 10 hours on the road in absolute comfort. We have small kids and the entertainment system (Bose, w/satellite and DVD) keeps everyone happy. Six adults fit easily. It's beautiful, and even strangers complement it. Get one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet, smooth ride. OnStar w/turn by turn; Fully loaded w/ backup camera, DVD, etc. 19" chrome wheels, elegant grille, luxurious paint. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have 25000 miles on my enclave and haven't had any major issues with my vehicle. On the highway at 50-55 mph I have easily gotten 30 mpg or better with the cruise on. At 60-65 mph with the cruise on I get about 29 mph. The on-star service eliminates my need for a navigation unit. I fill my tank every 9 days. The sunroof problem was easily fixed in one visit and I have had no more leaks. It turned heads the same day I purchased it and folk continue to drive up beside me and ask about it along with expressing how much they want one. Stick with the routine maintenance and chances are your buick will be on the road for a long time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything in my CXL along with the running boards that I had mounted on the side. Love the 10-speaker Bose Sysetm with MP3 player interface. It really rocks when I plug in my I-Pod. The AC outlet is cool for plugging in my computer or just charging my cell phone. It has styling for all seasons.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Took awhile to get used to the six speed transmission but I now love the car. We have taken two long trips (12000 miles)and fell in love with the car. Very quiet compared to the GMC and Saturn versions just great to drive on the freeway at high speeds...sticks to the road and very smooth..better than any Cadillac I ever owned</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is quite comfortable to drive and that is where my satisfaction ends. It has been back to the dealership many times for numerous problems.As of tonight you can't even shut the car off. We are driving a loaner. Had to get the jack out of the car and you need an engineering degree to do that. Would never want to have to use it along the road. Degree sensor problems, navigation problems transmission not shifting properly. If this is the kind of quality that you get for a vehicle this expensive it is no wonder General Motors is in the position they are. This is my last G.M. I guess it's Ford of Toyota from here on out</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Enclave is a great vehicle but a few things Buick needs to change: 1. Rain gutter over the doors - in rain or after an open door leads to the seat below getting soaked with the runoff from the roof. 2. If you open the rear seat windows while the front windows are up, the vibration is incredible - the car shakes badly, this is a problem! 3. Put the outside temperature gauge on the mirror with the compass. The passenger, my wife, cannot see the temp in the dash cluster and I'm tired of having to tell her what the temperature outside is every 30 miles...</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased the model with 2nd row bench seat so we could put the childs car seat in the middle. The middle compartment does move, but she can still kick the audio dials facing the 2nd row. The outside rear view mirrors block when turning left or right for someone that is short. The GPS system leaves a lot to be desired. We have a Garmin portable in the other vehicle and it does a lot better job. On sunny days, rear navigation system cannot be seen. Wish it had better gas mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very smooth ride and quiet. Love being able to run the DVD player and the radio at the same time. Seats are comfortable for both myself and much larger husband.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only had the Enclave for a few days but love driving it. I get many stares from people and people can't believe it's a Buick once they see it and look inside. Very roomy and great looking from every angle. Looked at Mazda CX9 and Volvo XC90...the Buick puts both to shame. It is roomier than both and although fully loaded doesn't have all the Mazda has to offer, and the Mazda was a lot cheaper to lease, I don't regret my decision to go with the Buick over the Mazda. The steerable headlights are great at night...and, unlike the Mazda, you aren't forced to choose between a rear seat DVD and a sunroof...the Buick has two roofs...Congrats GM on finally getting it right!Former Audi owner</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dual roofs, wood steering wheel and trim, retro look, steerable headlights, all around beauty of vehicle. Quietness is amazing!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So after much consideration between all the lambda options, we kept coming back to the Buick Enclave CXL. The Saturn was nice but we kept thinking the resale was going to be the lowest of all three. The GMC was great, but no perferated seats (we live in NC and leather and sun don't mix well!)and no cocoa interior. So, we settled on the Enclave. And are very happy we did! Everywhere we go people want to look inside and are blown away at how large it is in interior volume. When I tell them it is the same as a Tahoe or Yukon, they are amazed. This really is a minivan inside and sport utility outside. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Captains chairs are great! No more kids sitting to close to each other! (Stop touching me..ugh) Love the quite ride! You can really tell the difference. Love the Dolby surround sound on the movies. The headphones and audio are amazing. Gas mileage is great too! I get 19 in town and 24-25 highway</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my 2003 Lexus GX470 for the Enclave. I questioned my decision so many times but in the end decided to go with the Buick. Yes a Lexus for a Buick. I think I was just ready for a change and from the first time I saw the Enclave I knew I liked it. For one it drives as nice as the Lexus and feels more like driving a car (which I also traded-Honda Accord)on the Enclave. Yes two perfectly good vehicles for one. So far I like the Enclave. I too have noticed it hesitates trying to get up to speed but once you do it's fine. Gas mileage is 14-22. Maybe it will get better. I hope, at least driving around town. All in all I'm happy with my trade. I love the look of the it. Very sharp.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The depth of the seats,very comfortable because I'm tall, articulating headlights-I love what they do when you start the car, XM and knowing I have OnStar, dual sunroof, and just some features my Lexus didn't have like the the third row seats that fold flat. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded my BMW 3-series for this car. With a Lexus and a Bimmer, never thought I'd get a Buick, but couldn't find anything we liked better after looking at the Audi Q7, BMW X5, Lexus GX. None of those had as much 3rd row back seat room or ease of access as the Enclave. And this comes with nearly the same bells and whistles. Yes, a few parts appear cheap, but the quality and elegance of the rest of the interior far outpowers them. Cabin feels like flying first class in a plane. 5.1 Bose surround sounds amazing. Wish it had automatic self- closing driver/passenger doors, they're german car heavy! Handling suprisingly sporty, rides smooth & quiet. This is the car that will save Buick.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have about 6,000 miles on this great, great car. It is fun to drive, has exceptional room, is really comfortable, and everyone else loves it too. The interior has absolutely no cheap look or feel. So what if there is fake wood trim. I would rather have that than have to worry about keeping the finish on real wood. The transmission has been no problem at all. It is very smooth, and the car is powerful enough to easily accelerate to highway speeds when merging with traffic. I looked at the MDX, and the Mazda whatever it is numbered. They don't even come close to the value in this vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, navigation system, interior luxury, and roominess. The Bose sound system is great also. We have a Bose home entertainment system, and the one in the Enclave is competitive with it. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Oldsmobiles and Buicks park avenues have always upstood the times with me. Do not rotate my cars but drive the life out of them. Never owned a SUV until now. Love it. Went to the dealership to see pricing of the Lucerne and was shown the Enclave. Although I am single, after test driving, I knew it was for me. Handles like a car while also wowing my clients. From the stylish exterior to the classy interior, I have enjoy the comfort of driving this since November 2007. I am very pleased with my selection. Gas mileage is improving as I break it in. I get about 22 miles to the gallon on the road. I have driven approx. 8000 miles. I would highly recommend this vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After deciding we needed a more economical car to take the family and four dogs to our weekend place about 150 miles from home, we started looking at SUV's, CUV's, etc. I used to drive Mercedes wagons, and I was drawn back to them, but the middle row leg room is too short for our tall, adult-sized children, and the other Mercedes that did "fit" us (the R class) could not haul a trailer that we sometimes use. Enter, the Enclave! I took delivery on a CXL this week, and so far, I am very impressed! I've only gassed up once, but it got well over 20 mpg in mixed driving. The ride is comfortable, and I like the solid feel to the doors when you shut them --- very unlike a Honda!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ordered the Enclave in December and received in late February. Nice suv crossover. Heavy car that rides reasonable nice and very quite. I'm looking forward to future editions already to improve on some of the deficiencies that many have already described. Overall I'm very pleased with this first time purchase of a Buick. I previously owned several GM TrailBlazers and S10 Blazers. This vehicle is big inside and out. The cockpit feel is true and I flew a plane and can attest to the similar look and feel of the Cessna. Lots of forward glass with a clear unobstructed view. Back window view is very small, but not a big deal. I ordered without the overhead retractable window. Overall nice vehicle</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Articulating headlights, navigation system, many water pockets, quite ride, excellant folding flat rear seats. nice wood trim, sharp sporty look in white with 19" wheels. Heated seats, great lighting systems and back up camera. Folding mirrors. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the Enclave 3000 miles ago...less than a month and I was generally impressed with the vehicle until I drove it under various situations. In a nutshell, any wonderful features I enjoyed have been eclipsed by the incredibly terrible transmission. It is just not a pleasure to drive in the hills of western PA. This transmission does not know how to handle them. I'm taking it in this Monday for service, Buick tells me there is a recall for "Transmission Calibration" my suggestion for anyone interested is waitil the bugs are cleared up on this vehicles transmission. It will negate all the beautiful and comfortable features this vehicle has and ruin the driving experience.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Loved this car. Great interior, good build, quiet. God interior material, good controls. However, there is a problem with the transmission. Had to be reprogramed after a month because shift points were way off. Had to drop the trans ro replace control module at 10k miles, leaked out all trans fluid after the replacement and is now back in the shop for a week to replace same part and they can not get all of the seals necessary to finish. Wife is furious and wants do dump it now. Why can GM not get it all together. Finally got a winner and screwed it up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Enclave is without a doubt the best crossover on the market. Styling is second to none. The fit and finish is excellent. The car rides so smooth and is extremely quiet inside. Third row seats work great. This is a great alternative to the minivan. Safety features are great for a family vehicle. An overall quality Auto. Best car I ever owned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just purchased our vehicle on the 19th of February, 2008. We love the way it looks, and the way the interior makes you feel comfortable. We traded in our 2005 Tahoe for the Enclave, and love how it is easier to load the little ones, the only difference is when you are wanting to get up to speed it seems to hessitate, I guess I was just used to the V8, but enjoy not spending $80 in gas every week. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love love love the Enclave. Mine is the CXL fully loaded. Black with cashmere interior. Other people sure do a lot of staring. It is just beyond classy. My first experience from November to February was frustrating because the engine light kept coming on. As of yesterday Feb.22nd problem has been resolved. I'm a first time buyer with GM and consider it a great move. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Toyota and Honda are not the best in this market. I looked at the Lexus and the Accura and they did not provide the same number of benefits to justify their added costs. I really like the styling of the Buick much better than it's competitors. As far as the power is concerned. It is more than enough. It is a crossover vehicle not a sprint car. If you hate minivans, but want enough room for your family with all the modern creature comforts like xenon lights, nav, 2 dvds, xm leather, 2 sunroofs, in a really solid vehicle. I feel the Buick is the best choice. I am only 40 something, I didn't think I would ever own a Buick. Friends, neighbors can't believe how nice this car is!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1. Voice activated nav is great. 2. Car phone can participate in your Verizon minutes and not use on-star. 3. Articulating headlights. I didn't think that they would be that much of an advantage, but they are slick. 4. Bose stereo really sounds great...Pink Floyd on 10, hearing aids are optional</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought our Gold Mist CXL about a month ago (this is the third Enclave in our neighborhood) and my wife and kids love it! The ride quality and quietness of the vehicle is far superior than our Sienna we traded in. Had an ice storm last night and my wife made it home without any problems and we only have FWD. We love the backup camera and park assist which is great considering the small window in the back. Overall, this is an excellent vehicle that meets our luxury requirements with interior room similiar to a minivan. Only negative is the "less than ideal" gas mileage - we are getting 14 MPG city. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Enclave! It rides so smooth, handling great in the snow. I was hopeing for a little better gas milage, averages 16/17, 20max on highway. The interior is sharp w/wood grain and leather seats. I did get the DVD/Nav combo and use the Navigation daily w/my job. This vehicle is very roomy, I have space in the back to store items and also seating for 7. Do wish the 2nd row of seats could be adjusted front and back to give the back seat passangers more leg room if needed. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE> Two unique features are a tiny yellow light above the beverage holders between the front seats. This is nice at night to see w/out having a bright light on. Another is the outlet plug in(2 prong plug in). Great for my lap-top or the kids games.I love the clock too! Very classy looking.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is very quiet. It's like stepping into a bank vault. Several people have stopped us and asked what the vehicle is. They like the chrome. I particularly like the remote start feature and the power lift gate. Mileage has disappointed so far, but isn't a major drawback. The shifting is not noticeable at all. This is an incredible car. It's nice to see it being driven by young adults. It certainly is an affordable alternative to higher priced suburbans or other traditional suv's.</TEXT>

This car is very comfortable and quiet. I shopped around for months before I found something I love. My kids love the DVD player. My husband loves the telescopic steering wheel.

<TEXT>This is my second GM car in the past 5 years, 20 previous were imports. I traded the first one for this Enclave after two transmissions over 65000 miles and like a fool bought another one! I have a loaded White Diamond and it is now in the shop for the 4th time in 6 weeks with same problem, the emission light continues to come on. Needless to say, the performance suffers immensely when this occurs. They have yet to figure out what is wrong. Sensors have been replaced, not sure what they are doing at this point. Can you say "lemon law". The car really is a nice car, when it is not in the shop! Perhaps I am just not meant to own an American made automobile. I have learned my lesson.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned several vehicles over the years that were regular sedans. However, I needed an SUV so I tried the GMC Envoy and GMC Yukon. Both were okay, but I wanted the luxury I was use to. I test drove a Lincoln Navigator and Lexus RX. Then I drove the Buick Enclave and I was sold. I never considered a Buick. I suppose because it they were, as the old saying goes, your fathers car. However, Buick has distanced itself from that saying with the Enclave. The cars that I have owned were simply transportation to me. I did not consider them fun to drive. There have only been two cars that I really enjoyed driving. They were a Lexus LS and Lincoln Town Car. However, now I can add the Buick Enclave</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride is smooth and quiet. Both the third row and second row seats fold flat giving more cargo space. Adaptive headlights. The interior and exterior design is a real eye catcher.

I live in a rural community and everywhere I go is a trip (an hour to the nearest Wal-Mart)and the comfort of the Enclave is wonderful. It has a quite smooth stable ride and is easy to handle.

<TEXT>My wife and I are both very picky when it comes to cars and we usually only stick with imports that have high reliability ratings. A little over two years ago, we wouldn't have even considered Buick (or any GM for that matter) when we wanted to look for a new SUV, but when I saw the Enclave revealed at the Detroit Auto Show back in 06, I immediately liked it's styling. My biggest complaint with U.S. auto makers over the last 20 years or so is primarily not build quality (although it has been relatively poor), but design. The Enclave's design is what did it for me. We absolutely love the Enclave. I don?t regret it for one second.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior and exterior design, rear storage space and capacity. Third row seat room and comfort - (I am 6'3" and fit nicely in the third row,) sunroof/skyroof, center console, very comfy fabric seats, integrated XM radio, OnStar (one of the main reasons we bought the Buick), quietness!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My driving style is moderate. My car is fully loaded, the only options I did not get were the rear entertainment system and upgraded wheels. 4000 miles in the first month. MPG (calculated, not from the trip computer) around town 20, Trips as high as 26.5 but usually 22. This is a nice quiet solid car. The seat is comfortable on long trips. There is little wind and road noise. The all wheel drive is great in both snow and ice. The air conditioning is very good. The car gets many compliments on its styling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This Enclave is the 27th vehicle I have owned, the great majority being GM brands. I had about given up on GM for my next vehicle until I saw the Enclave at the Phoenix Auto Show. I purchased one two weeks later and love it. The quality is exceptional and the styling and performance leave nothing to be desired. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm very excited the Buick Enclave I purchased has been the hit of our neighborhood. Everyone likes the design of the exterior and interior as much as I do. I love almost everything about the car with the exception of the following things. Why arn't heated seats in the rear available? They are in some of the other SUV's that GM makes, but on this car they are missing. I wanted all options, but when the car arrived it didn't have the luggage rack cross bars I bought and paid for. The running boards were also paid for and the dealer can't tell me when the delivery date might be. The sales information states the the rear headphones come with option 3, but I now find out that isn't true. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought mine on New Years Eve. Looked all over for the Red Jewel one. Went to a dealer the day before and they sold the one I wanted an hour before I got there. Managed to locate one the next day and bought it. I love it. I've always been a Honda buyer so this is my first American car for a while. This is definitely my red jewel. It's gorgeous, and fun to drive and so very smooth. Plus the family love all the options we got with the DVD play XM radio etc. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM radio, navigation, and love the classy wood trim. Seats are very comfortable and also love the sun roof and remote start. I'm from Florida and it got cold down here for a couple of days. Loved the remote start to get the car warmed up. Probably will love it in the summer too.</FAVORITE>

It's roomy, beautiful,and loaded with all the features anyone could want and you don't need to take out a mortgage to own it! My neighbor commented that the interior is just like a cockpit of a small jet (and he didn't read the promotional add!). For performance, styling and handling,this car is at the head of its class.

<TEXT>This car is hands down the classiest looking large crossover/suv on the market. Fully loaded with the 7 passenger seating this car is nicer than a Mercedes GL or R Class. I never thought I'd buy a Buick, but after istting in this car and test driving it, we knew we had found a winner. GM's 100K mile warranty makes ownership hassle free. Other reviewers have mentioned it, the car would benefit from more power, but then again, gas isn't going back to $2/gallon anytime soon, and for around town there's plenty of power. How many people are going to drag race with this car anyway. Second row bucket seats make 3rd row access easier, and really make this a hands down winner it its class! </TEXT>

Absolutely love the ability to manually shift from 1st to 6th gears. Fold down seats make lots of cargo space. Remote opening of the lift gate helps when you have large loads. It is so quiet thanks to Thinsulate insulation. The mirrors are large,easily adjustable. 12 cup holders means no spills. Numerous airbags make me feel safer,esp with kids in tow.

<TEXT>Buick has really nailed it with the Enclave CXL AWD. The Enclave CXL exceeds comparisons to any simliar luxury class vehicle. At first look your eyes can't help but notice the attractive styling looks of the exterior. Buick is on track with one of the finest SUv's ever built by GM's so called "Mom and Dad's" Buick vehicle line. The luxurious leather and wood grained interior, Bose sound system and extremely quiet ride is worthy of a world class luxury automobile costing tens of thousands more! The interior experience and ride and handling is so impressive. After I park it, I can't wait to drive it again! My VP at work was so impressed, he mentioned trading in his Wife's Lexus for the CXL.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Beautiful styling cues. Luxury compliments found only in the best of class, all others are now second to the 2008 Buick Enclave CXL, every detail is well engineered.

<TEXT>Owned a 2000 Jimmy, & my wife wanted something new. I actually wanted a GMC Acadia since they came out but also looked at Ford, Lincoln, Chrysler and Mitsubishi SUV's and crossovers. Needed something that could tow my boat, haul my 2 sons and their instruments (Cello & an upright Bass) and room for 2 big dogs. The dealer had a couple of Enclaves on the lot so we test drove one - it became a must have. Nothing else that fit our requirements compared. We bought one in Moca w/ Ebony leather, sun roof, (the wife's must have and 2 are better than one) and the 4500# towing package. So far, after 1500 miles of mostly around town w/ some expreesway driving we are getting 18.5MPG - pleasently suprised</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned and driven many GM vehicles over the years. I never have been in such a comfortable and quiet vehicle as this Enclave is. I took a drive and ride test earlier this year with a side by side comparison with the Lexus & Acura. It braked, handled, steered and was much quieter than either of the other foreign vehicles in its class I was so impressed that I had to have one. I order the new Moca color with tan interior. My wife loves the color combination and the beautiful styling too. She likes that she can set her own temp on her side of the vehicle. We were impressed with the ride, handling and braking. The pickup was more than enough for our needs. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Articulating headlamps are a great feature. The remote starter that turns on the heated seats and rear defogger when needed.

<TEXT>We exhaustively shopped for this X- over vehicle, and selected this Enclave in Ming Blue (hence, "Big Blue.") It is without doubt, the finest vehicle I have purchased in 20 years (most recent purchases have been premium european sedans). The build quality and quality of materials used is awesome! I did not expect this from a US car company. I have 9300 miles, and everyone at the office fights to drive it. I would encourage anyone who has to haul people and their stuff on a routine basis to seriously consider this vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The articulated headlights are the best safety feature ever.

<TEXT>Has been nothing but a pleasure to drive. Fuel economy is a plus. Pretty well thought out interior/exterior, but as always, there is room for improvement. We have experienced none of the transmission shifting issue that some of the earlier models had. If you want a performance vehicle, then maybe you better look elsewhere. The motor may be a little underpowered, but is adequate. The ride/quiet interior are just like advertised. We added sunroof, machined aluminum wheels, asst. steps, rear backup sensor, heated washer solvent and remote start to the basic CX model that already had a great standard equipment package. We would buy this vehicle again! Nothing else out there like the Enclave! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The unique exterior design. Quiet tuning and the way the it drives, rides & handles for a vehicle this large. Power rear liftgate and the remote start. XM radio. 4yr-50000 mile warranty.

This car has tons of interior room, an excellent ride, superb switchgear and is as quiet as any car I have ever been in. Well-designed options include bi-zenon articulating headlamps; heated washer fluid, lumbar that adjusts up and down, trailer hitch cover integrated into bumper; and power folding mirrors. All the required luxury amenities are present and work perfectly. Handling is excellent for a 5000lb vehicle. Steering input is precise with no dead spot. The brake pedal has long travel yet is confident. The styling is turning heads at virtually every street corner and parking lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Handles and rides like a dream. Considerably more power than the Pacifica that I traded in.The Bose audio system is terrific although I am still figuring out all the entertainment system controls. The Enclaves pictured in the brochure show a center console (small asterisk and print indicates rear center console available at a later date). So, from the front seat forward I rate the interior as having a very rich diamond and sapphire look but from the front seat back to the tailgate I give it a cardboard and plastic look. I hope GM offers the rear console as a dealer installed option at a reasonable price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A remarkable overall exterior design that get a lot of attention. People stop to check it out, walk around it and give an approving nod. Even double check the Buick name on the back in a pleasant surprise. And that's just from 0 mph on the parking lot. On the road is another story. This Buick Enclave is a sure candidate to be a classic, well engineered inside and out. Its design elements all blends together appealingly devoid of any offensive lines and/or bulges like most other vehicles. This SUV is pleasant to the eyes. As for performance, it could use a few more horses, otherwise it is a well equiped and capable SUV. Maybe shedding a few lbs will do the trick. Bravo Buick! </TEXT>

The ride is very quiet and the captain's chairs are fantastic. The car looks fantastic and also to drive. My son loves the DVD with the wireless headphones. I fell in love with the turn by turn directions which I use a lot and the emergency phone in the car via OnStar can be very helpful if you are in a jam. Lastly, I use the remote start a lot as I live in FL and it gets very hot and it cools down the car before I get in with my toddler.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As a BMW owner for the last 10 years this is my first purchase of a Buick ever. To be honest there hasn't been a Buick model that ever looked worthy of owning, untill now. I have only had it for 3 weeks and so far this looks like it will be a winner for GM. The ride and interior are both very comfortable and the value received for the money spent is incredible. Every option that you could want at about $300 a month less in a lease versus BMW. Of course this large vehicle does not accelerate nor corner like an X5 but it wasn't built for that. Nevertheless, it does what it was built to do and very well I may add. A great vehicle for mid to long road trips. I highly recommend it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my wife's beautiful inspiration yellow T-Bird on a Buick...and I questioned our sanity on both purchases. One day after purchase we ventured out on a 1000 mile winery tour and I'm happy to say we feel our minds are in fact stable. I'm around/in vehicles of all kinds in various stages of their life every day, so my ratings are on a very broad scale of experience. I was suprised by the admirable mpg averages and it's ability to make hours behind the wheel pass quickly and comfortably. We have every option but AWD and the Luxury package (folding mirrors, power wheel, and the lighting trick GM killed the Tucker for some 50 years ago), so we'll see how it all holds up. God Bless!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like all the gadgets, but I worry things like the Nav system and complex radio controls will distract my wife, who is the primary driver. The Nav saved alot of back-tracking on a couple occasions, as some of the directions in brochures are just wrong! The whole package works well together.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We are a mid 30's couple with 3 kids who typically buys imports. I recently purchased a 2007 Acura MDX Sport to replace a Lexus -- so I have a good reference point. We traded in a Toyota Sienna. Never thought we'd buy a Buick, but were always open to an American car that is competitive on the merits. This car makes a mockery of most competitors. This is a remarkable car that feels like it should cost $15k more (at least). Build quality and quietness are superior to my Acura, and it is far more plush and stylish in my opinion. It appears to be nothing short of the rebirth of the American family vehicle. Put your image of Buick as you know it aside and give this thing a try. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior is a future classic, gorgeous materials for the money. The use of the more than ample space is fantastic. Love the space behind the third row, and this thing is quiet! Engine even sounds nice --like my Acura's! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought my Enclave (CXL, AWD) 3 days ago and very pleased so far. Traded up from a 2002 Rendezvous, and if you know that car you'll know I had some concerns about buying another Buick. The Enclave, however, is superb: no defects and no trips back to the dealer. Handling and ride are far superior to the Rendezvous, and to the other 'cross-over' cars we looked at. The Ford Edge/Lincoln MKZ is the only real competitor among domestics, and it's a little jittery on the road. Lexus RX350 is equal to the Enclave but a lot more money, and I couldn't find a new (2008) Highlander anywhere to compare. So take a look at the Enclave: you'll be impressed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle does so many things well. I looked at a lot of vehicles before choosing the Enclave. Other 3 row CUV's do not match up to the Enclave's value, refinement, reliability, usability (storage capacity/passenger room and comfort) Car has good acceleration for a vehicle its size and role as a luxury family hauler. The vehicle cools down quickly. You can access the third row from both sides of the car unlike the MDX and you don't have to be a contortionist. It has plenty of room behind the 3rd row for a stroller and cooler. I could go on and on.</TEXT>

The fit and finish is first class, the engineering is current, and the price is $15 to $20 below the BMW. First new American car I've gotten for myself in almost 40 years. Not your grandfather's Buick! Will help bring quality reputation back to the marque. </TEXT>

My 9 year old had the rear audio wireless system operational in minutes! The engine is smooth and pleasingly powerful. The exhaust note is perfect. The cabin is exemplary, with outstanding switchgear that has excellent tactile feel. Interior lighting is superb. The "Googley-Eyed" Bi-Zenon articulating headlamps light to the horizon. I traded in a '04 Sequoia: I could hardly read the dash in any lighting. Enclave's dash is the new benchmark. What? No red line on the tach?

<TEXT>I own an Acura MDX and owned a Lexus RX in the past. I test drove most of the SUVs in the mid and large sections. I was very surprised to find that the Buick Enclave had fantastic handling and good gas mpg(for its size). It is a beautiful and logical car making it easy and fun to drive. The large capacity is perfect for all the members of my family, most of them being very tall. It is larger than most of the big truck SUVs, but it drives like a car. I have never considered owning an American car before. I must say, I love my new Buick Enclave! It is a quality car that comfortably fits seven people for a much lower price than the Acura or Lexus.</TEXT>

I traded in a Honda for a Buick...I would never had believed that was possible. I could not be more pleased. I am driving a great looking car (people are asking me all the time what it is) that is very comfortable.

<TEXT>After 15 years of European cars we finally found a US built vehicle we wanted to own. After a test drive we knew something great had finally come from GM. It was like a jumbo MDX that made a first impression so quiet we could actually talk and enjoy the music. Handling is that of a sedan half the size and seating is second to nothing we ever owned. We were not in the market for a car but had gone to the dealer for an upgrade to an OnStar system when we saw it. Two days later we took it home. For the first time in my life I got a new car with nothing to fix right from the dealer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seating, great looks, safety features. 5 star ratings, anti lock, stability control, traction control, air bags for all seating positions, HID headlights w/steering and super quiet. Nothing this large has ever driven so well. And $10,000 less than my sister's MDX</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving may competing alternative vehicles, the Enclave out classed them all. Although it took 4 months to get, it was worth the wait. Every aspect of the Enclave is very satisfying. It is obvious from many "minor" details that much engineering went into the development of the car. As the owner of 4 Buicks prior to this one, it is the best I've driven in 20 years. The car seems bigger once inside that it appears from the outside, yet it drives nimbly. Anyone that wants a vehicle to carry more than 4 people comfortably needs to drive the Enclave before purchasing any other vehicle. Great Job Buick!</TEXT>

The car is loaded with everything (more than we orignally wanted) but with limited dealship inventory, we took what was available. Trip included multiple mtn. passes with elevation over 10k ft., and as high as 12k. We got 24.6 MPG overall, which I thought was great considering the terrain driven. Often when we returned from a hike or train ride we found people gathered around the car in the parking lot admiring it. We researched a lot of cross-over models, and we think we made the right choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this SUV. Had it a month now. Very quiet and comfortable. Handles well. Mileage as advertised. Many car reviews complain about the trans not downshifting quickly. These reviewers didn't understand when/how to use the manual shifter. On hilly highways select 5 instead of D. 6th gear is for mostly flat highways. On backroads D is fine. The auto-manual shifter works differently than my other cars. If you select 4 or 5 in manual mode, the trans will auto downshift and upshift to the gear selected. My other cars only downshift auomatically but require you to manually upshift through each gear. </TEXT>

It didn't hurt that the Enclave is quieter than the X5 and offers comparable features for $18K less. I drive a 5 series BMW so I was kind of rooting for the X5 but I find myself enjoying the Enclave more than I imagined. It does everything in a smooth and refined way.

<TEXT>We bought our Enclave used with 11K miles and remaining factory warranty and have owned it for nearly 1 year. It has served us well with no problems. It is quieter and smoother riding than its relative (Acadia). Middle seats are comfortable, 3rd row comfort is exceptional. We average about 17 mpg/city, and 24/hwy, which is just as good as my 2005 Hyundai Sonata was getting prior to trade in; So pretty good for its size in my opinion.

We went on a road trip in October from Arkansas to Florida with four adults and all of our luggage and there was plenty of room for everyone. The Turn by Turn Navigation was wonderful! The car is very comfortable and quiet on the road. I love the XM radio and also the fold flat third row seating.

<TEXT>The 2nd row (when folded forward) floats while driving (no latch to keep it in place). No room for groceries in hatch. Cannot open hatch in garage - too high. Remote start seldom works, took it to dealership and told me that "electrical devices could be getting in the way". Driver's side heat blasts on one side only; burning one foot while the other one freezes. Seats six not seven comfortably. The pin stripe is one little stripe down the side and you have to pay an additional $700 for something that is already on the car; it wasn't negotiable. No power when passing. Bose sound is a joke as you hear everything on the outside of the car. I have had leaks and other issues. The Buick Enclave is attractive, but it is not sound proof as some guy blogged earlier. I have had this car for a year and trust me, I hear everything. I was told not to buy it but I thought it was so beautiful...regret everyday now. I seriously hate driving this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Was ready to buy an Acadia AWD, and then saw the Enclave CX FWD. More standard items. Acadia has no traction control. It was a no brainer Enclave all the way. MSRP's really close. Saturn Outlook would not discount MSRP! Extremely quiet, Buick did a great job on keeping the quiet in and sound out. Driving a pleasure, even my wife says it?s "so big" but does not drive that way, comfortable luxury ride, good handling for its size. It's surprising on turns. Very nice fit and finish. All around gas is decent according to the cars computer 17.5 Waiting to take it on a trip. This is my first GM in a long time and I do not think it is a GM car! I traded a Sienna van and have no regrets. What took Buick so long!? </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy entry to third row. The quiet! Styling. Three zone climate control. The dash layout and lighting. The lighting, at night, reflects onto the console making it look illuminated and easy to find items. It feels like a quality Lexus I just hope Buick got the reliability to go with this fine product.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My last car was an Infinti G35 coupe, and I traded it for a Blue CXL FWD two weeks ago and love it. They should have called it a Roadmaster: Quiet comfortable cabin, great styling, tons of room, plenty of pep, very smooth over bumps even with 19" rims (if you keep the tire pressure at 32 fr/30 rr). Excellent handling for a big SUV, much better than the Trailblazer I rented last year. So far gas mileage is not bad, 19-20 in mostly city driving, 24 on a short hwy run. Only rarely noticed trans downshift issue reported in mag reviews, but the terrain is pretty flat here. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Lots of research went into our choice of the Enclave. We have not been disappointed! It is a joy to drive, offering super quiet interior and ride, plush CXL leather seating, Bose speaker system, handles fantastic on the road. We towed our boat this weekend, and it handled it better than my previous SUV, hands down. A lot of thought went into this vehicle. We're getting better than stated gas mileage, which is a nice surprise! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This vehicle is loaded with safety features, including airbags everywhere. All three rows of seating are comfortable, with the third row of seating easy to reach, thanks to fold up and out of the way second seats! The vehicle is fun to drive, and we'd buy it again!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second American vehicle and have to say this time I'm very pleased with it so far. Very quiet and plush ride. The handling isn't bad either for a 2 and 1/2 ton vehicle. The overall apperance is on a par with other luxury vehicles. Even though, I wasn't loooking for performance, the MPG is below average and transmission slow to change when pushed, but smooth. Some of the materials used looks a little cheap and outdated. Some of the technology is below that of its competitors. Reliability is in question, but only time will tell. Overall, I would recommend this vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got our new Enclave and couldn't be happier. Had many more "bells and whistles" than we even knew about going in! Such a quiet ride, very solid feel. Decent pick-up on the freeway, but it's not a sports car. Perfect car for a family who needs a mini-van but doesn't want to get one. Very comparable to higher-end SUVs. Would highly recommend a close look at the Enclave to any family with three or more children.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had the Enclave CXL for three weeks and simply love it. After test driving the Enclave, we quickly discovered it rides smoother and is much quieter then the Acadia and Outlook. The interior is very comfortable with ample room for 7. Although the engine is not a rocket, the 275 HP is plenty for its size and weight. The 6 speed transmission is smooth. Enclave gets 1 less mpg then the Acadia and Outlook maybe because it's a little heavier. But at least it runs on 87 octane. Glad we looked at the Enclave as we almost bought the Acadia or Outlook. Some people may prefer the looks of the Acadia or Outlook, but the ride and quietness of Enclave can't be beat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After much searching in this price range, my wife and I were settled on the Acadia. However, we took one test drive in the new Buick and were amazed at how much better looking and how much better equipped the Enclave is compared to the Acadia. The ride is smooth and quiet with nice accleration from the six speed automatic. The Buick is not going to snap your neck with speed, but is perfectly capable of quick passing maneuvers when needed. The interior is what really impressed us. My wife and I are in our late 20's and have never considered a Buick until now. The clock in the dash looks great and at night the interior lighting befits a much higher priced car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife had to get the Buick Enclave. We looked at the GMC Acadia and Saturn Outlook. We just about purchased the Outlook and then found an Enclave that just came into the dealership. Hard to believe that this is a Buick. Finally a reasonably priced car that isn't a minivan and fits our family of 7. Believe it or not my wife hated our Escalade, too big. Now she doesn't have to drive the giant bling bling to fit our family. For the price a much better choice than the Acadia or Outlook. Buick did a good job.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have never owned a GM vehicle. I have been waiting for this one since its debut at the Detroit Auto Show. Almost bought an Acadia because they came out first and I was chomping at the bit. Am so glad I was patient. It was well worth it. Drives beautifully. Very quiet. Very smooth. Handling is quite responsive. Feels very solid and safe. Looks great. Interior is nice. Plenty of room in all three rows. Traded in a Chrysler Town & Country that I loved. No regrets. Only the third day of my ownership, but so far I am quite pleased. Looking for excuses to drive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After first month of owning this Enclave has been nothing but trouble. Since June 08 we have had two transmission software updates (tranny shifting still terrible. Acts as though it doesn't know what gear it's suppose to be in). Rear liftgate opens by itself (when car off luckily). With automatic operation turned off we still hear the lift motor engage. Heat controls stopped working twice. At times when driving all gauges read as though the car is turned off. With cruise control set at 75 MPH for nearly two hours the best MPG I get is 17. In city getting 13 MPG is a good day. Dealer is trying their best but I don't hold out for much improvement.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall a very good vehicle. I'm very glad that I overcame my bias that Buick is for grandparents. This one is definitely worth checking out when considering Lexus or BMW. My minor negatives: I'm 5'11" and once adjusted the steering wheel almost totally obstructs the speedometer. The navigation system is hands down the worst one I've owned. It often will not recognize side roads and has poor voice prompts for upcoming turns. I find myself frequently looking at the screen when I can rely completely on voice prompts with my other vehicles. Finally, the second row captain seats are great, but a console option between them would be a welcome addition.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We moved out of the domestic market in the 1990's for better quality, e.g. Nissan, Lexus. We wanted an AWD SUV and deduced that the quality imports had gotten out of our reach. We were really taken by the Enclave when we tested one out, so we ordered one. To our disappointment we have found that the wheels & hubs build up with snow, ice or mud which sets up an uncomfortable vibration Which can only be alleviated by washing the wheels thoroughly with a pressure washer. The Dealer tells us that this is a common issue in all the newer vehicles due to the open hub. I am suspicious that this is a run around. I also drive a 2008 Explorer at work that exhibits no such problem. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great looks, the quietness is excellent has a great sound system, has adequate power for our requirements, has good cargo space for travel for 4 adults. The fuel consumption at 25 mpg is reasonable for such a large vehicle and the handling is excellent. We really like the 3rd row seating. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was a little unsure going from a Lexus RX 300, but now I can tell you I have surely traded up! It felt a little big at first, but I have come to love the looks, driveablity and functionality. It has plenty of power. I got very concerned during the high gas prices recently, but my mileage has actually improved. I have put on 10000 miles in 5 months. I get about 19 in my combo city/interstate work commute driving and about 27, yes 27 on the open highway. Also recently during the hurricane damage and recovery it has come in very handy making trips to Lowes and Home Depot. We got it fully loaded with AWD. We love all the features - lots of luxury and a sport drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wanting to replace my Escalade, I looked at Mercedes, Lexus, Infiniti, Acura, & Mazda's. I then found the GM Lamda platform of which Traverse caught my eye first. I then drove the Outlook and Acadia but after I drove the Enclave I knew! It had such an incredibly smooth, quiet ride with technology only found in more expensive vechiles. After I get over the shock that I am driving a Buick (it looks so damn good for a Buick!), all else has been a fantastic experience for me. This platform should help Americians look at buying a great product from their own country again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We absolutely love this crossover. We receive many compliments on its styling. Absolutely no problem other than the transmission hesitates on occasion. There is a program change we are considering which I'm told will seem like a 50 hp boost..downside I'm told might be a lost in fuel economy (Currently 17.9 MPG in town and consistently with hard driving on the freeway 21+ MPG). We bought the factory running boards-they are very helpful for some elderly folks we transport and it really dresses up that vehicle..and they fit perfectly into the styling. Only downside, power lift hits our garage door (triggers automatic close) so we have to turn it off when we drive into the garage. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the styling, love the factory running boards, backup warning excellent, on board navigation features helps you, with a touch, know the condition of your vehicle down to tire pressure in each tire.

<TEXT>Just yesterday our Enclave was finally delivered. We had to wait a few months as we had the car imported from the US. We had driven the car during our two weeks holidays in Florida May 2008 and fell in love with it. The car drives smoothly, is silent and has a lot of space. With 3 children the Enclave is the perfect family car. Classy and not as ordinary as a BMW X5 or Audi Q7. The fun part is that the Enclave offers as much as these cars but is far cheaper. Too bad that the XM radio does not work in Europe. It uses fuel but not as much as expected. We like the seats for total 8 people and the exclusive look & feel of the Enclave. We are sure to enjoy the Enclave for a many years to come. </TEXT>

Once in for electrical problems after owning it for 3 months. 3 times in for leak in ceiling (water drips in through the third row overhead maplights). The car came back to me after being in the shop (3rd time for leak) last week. So far, so good. No more leaks.

<TEXT>I accept the fact that my Enclave might be a lemon. Camshafts, weird engine noises, minor electrical freak- outs- and that's only within the first 3 months of ownership. The design is good but build quality is very average - panels do not align well, some a crooked, etc. It does what it is designed for - haul 7-8 people, but the transmision will make you adjust your driving style to a typical Buick drivers style. Add a virtually non-existent support by GM/local dealers ( I tried a few) and you may want to think carefuly before you but it. </TEXT>

I am averaging 17.8mpg around town, one small trip got 25.4mpg. High quality and attention to detail make it extra special. You should consider the back up camera as backing visibility is restricted by design. I traded a Tahoe which I loved but I am over it. Navagation system not as good as good as Garmin.

<TEXT>The Enclave has been apart of our family for over a year now and we enjoy it everytime we drive it. Our white CX model with black cloth seats has been through a lot in a year and passed with flying colors. The Buick has been on several long distance road trips and returned 23 to 24 MPG with cruise set on 70-72 MPH. Except for a recall to reprogram the transmission to shift quicker we have only been to the dealer for regular oil changes. We have towed a pop-up camper to state parks and have folded all the seats down to fit a full size dresser (new in its box) in the back. Our model has the second row bench seat and we are glad we got it since our newborn and his carseat fit comfortably. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Transmission hesitation/performance is a glaring design issue. At times the tranny acts as it doesn't know what gear it is suppose to be in. Which negatively effects MPG. Currently gettng 14-15 city and 16-18 highway. Dealer installed software update but no help. Another update is available but told it would cost me 3-4 MPG and once installed ut can't be backed out! Have had 9 other Buicks and loved them all. This car, once you look past its beauty is a big dissappointment. Would not recommend until GM permanently fixes the tranny issues.

<TEXT>I love my Enclave! Already made one trip from Ontario to Florida with two golden retrievers and a roof rack full of stuff! No problems. Took 6 people out and about down there on day trips, all comfortable. I too can only find the tailgate button on the keyfob while inside, is there a button? Other than on the tailgate?

<TEXT>I love my Buick Enclave. It looks great. People have said it reminds them of the much more expensive Audi. It is super comfortable inside. It's a wide car, so sometimes parking and tight turns can be challenging. I had a GMC Envoy before this, and I would estimate the mileage on the Enclave to be about 30% better. I do a lot of city driving, so I can't say what I am averaging per gallon, but it is pretty good for a SUV of this size. Only problem I ever have is sometimes overshifting into low instead of drive, but maybe that's just me. These are great cars, and I'm seeing more and more of them on the street.</TEXT>

<TEXT>You will not be disappointed with this CUV. We love it! Buick has hit a home run with the Enclave. We traded in a '01 Expedition with the same 1st and 2nd row captain chairs as the Enclave. I'm 46 and I never thought I'd own a Buick but I don't regret it at all. For the money, the seating configuration, capacity, features, performance, this is an absolute bargan. We were closely looking at the GMC Acadia (which is great as well) but the luxury, quiet ride, looks won us over. We looked at many other brands in this segment but there were very few that could seat 7 with the dual captain chairs. The V6 has plenty of power and transmission seems to shift smoothly for us. Great job Buick! We are very satisfied. GM should use this as an example to improve their bottom line.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have purchase over 45 new vehicles in my life, this is the best of all. I traded a Toyota Avalon for this Enclave and it is so much nicer I fell bad I ever tried a Toyota. If you are looking for a great vehicle, Enclave is the answer, cannot say one bad thing about it, never had a car/truck to even start comparing with this. Have had several Buicks in past, all good vehicles but this is the first great vehicle! Have 6000 very enjoyable miles on it and look forward to many more. Thanks Buick.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Enclave saved my life! I was recently in a car accident where another vehicle hit my Enclave and totaled it. However, I was able to walk away from the accident. The Enclave absorbed most of the impact. Everyone at the body shop said this had to be one safe car for me to not have been more seriously injured. As a father of two little toddlers, I'm so glad for this vehicle and can't wait to buy another one. Not to mention that it is a beautiful car and a very smooth, comfortable ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this vehicle. It drives very smoothly. I bought the navigation system and used it and OnStar for a recent trip to CA. The best road trip I've ever taken with the turn-by-turn directions. The seats are extremely comfortable and I have it on good authority from my family that you can actually seat 3 people in the third row without being too uncomfortable. The way the second row moves forward makes it easy for people to sit in the third row and gives ample leg room for both the second and third row. I am thrilled with my purchase. The only negative is that I'm only averaging 14.3 mpg in town, but do believe I hit the 24 mpg on the highway trip to CA. I love the diagnostic reports.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We loved our Enclave before taking a 5400 mile road trip with 4 adults plus luggage, but now we wouldn't part with it for any vehicle on the road. For 5400 miles we averaged 20.2 miles per gallon, which we were really happy about since the vehicle was loaded. We drove through the Pennsylvania hills and the car performed beautifully - not a sign of the transmission hesitancy some people grouse about. The ride was superb, the carrying capacity was more than adequate, and the interior arrangement was really handy for all of the things we took. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I took possesion of my Enclave on June 1 and took it for a drive throught the Rocky mountains. Wow, what a ride! I am totally impressed with this vehicle. Gas mileage was decent at 23.9MPG. This is a sexy looking CUV both in and out and is extremely quiet. The seats are extremely comfortable front and back. The nav system is also a great feature that I found invaluable driving in unfamiliar cities. OnStar is also great, I love the personal service that you get with this. This should be standard on all vehicles. I will be using this car to haul long items and I have more room than my old Dodge Caravan. The seats can be configured to fit almost any need. Congrats to the Buick designers</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just completed a 2700 mile trip with four adults and lots of luggage. Averaged 21 MPG for entire trip and 24 MPG interstate at 73 MPH average. Drove 1000 straight miles only stopping for breaks and gas. Never felt tired or stiff. Seating and ease of handling are exceptional. Lives up to and exceeds quiteness claims. Did not find that shifting was a problem as other owners have eluded to, it was very smooth even with numerous terrain changes. This vehicle will get 27 MPG+ at 60 MPH on a level road. This is a great car for the money. Exterior and interior styling and workmanship are outstanding. Presently have 8500 miles on vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2008 Enclave is one year old with 23,000 miles. I waited a year to write this review so it would be more accurate. Bad things: I get 16 mpg consistantly, much less than I expected. Transmission is a constant issue. Pulling on to a highway from an on ramp into traffic is tricky as this car just doesn't have the acceleration or power needed to pull this off effortlessly. When heat/AC is on with the fan it is very loud. Moulding of the front bumper comes to a point and is very low to the ground. Watch curbs when parking! Good things: Roomy inside and we love the "minivan" seating arrangement where you can walk through to the third row. It looks nice and turns many heads. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first American made car that I have ever purchased. No American cars ever interested me. I traded a 2004 Volvo XC90 for the Enclave. The Enclave is a big jump in quality especially for the price. The XC90 equipped similarly would cost $10K more. The ride is very smooth and quiet. We bought it loaded. My daughter loves the DVD. I like OnStar, navigation system, back-up camera and power liftgate. Adults can actually sit in the 3rd row comfortably. Behind the 3rd row there is room for luggage or coolers for tailgating. The gas mileage so far (800 miles) is not as good as the Volvo. The Enclave gets 15 MPG in the city. Overall, a great value. I highly recommend it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my 04 Sequoia and have never looked back. Everything about this car is better than the Toy. I can repeatedly get 25 mpg on the highway if I pay attention and keep my speed within 5 mph of the limit. Quit whining about gas mileage in a 5000 lb vehicle! The tranny is designed to max your mpg, not your quarter-mile times. We've had two long road trips, and this is way more comfy than my "class leading" 01 Grand Caravan ever was. This car is drop-dead gorgeous inside and out. Ten months and 16k later I am still in love with my car. I have every option, and all the bells and whistles work perfectly. OnStar seems to have upgraded their nav system as it seems more accurate than last year.</TEXT>

The Escalade was difficult if not imposible for large people to get into the rear seats. This new car gets very good gas mileage. On a trip to Phoenix I got 21 MPG and that is averaging 75 mph! Being a S Californian I calibrated up to 31 miles per gallon going from Beaumont Ca, to Onterio airport Ca about 50 miles. Every time the freeway: Hwy 10 was going down hill I put the car in neutral.

It holds the lower gears for instant throttle response. It came with a warning that it may decrease mpg by 0-2 mpg. I saw the 0. I get 22 on the interstate doing 76 mph. My wife got 23.5 mpg on a rural drive with small towns to go through. I get 14 mpg in around town/short trip driving. It's very reliable, too.</TEXT>

Never did I think I would love the quiet and smoothness so much, I assume my son likes it as well since he snoozes in it so well. I have also carried a full load of people on a 4-hour trip with no complaints and 20MPG. Not bad for 7 Adults and one child. As for around town driving, I get an average of about 17MPG with mostly local driving. I've never gotten less than 15MPG, with very city-like local short trips, so I am not sure what some people are doing to get less than that. Finally, we have had exactly 0 problems.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was really looking forward to better fuel economy than my Toyota Sequoia - but I've been very disappointed (avg 13 mpg - Sequoia avg was 16!). The dealer service department said they get tons of calls with dissatisfied customers regarding mileage of the Enclave. The transmission is also a bit screwy, you really have to push on the gas to convince it to downshift on a hill - and mine supposedly has had that transmission "fix" from the earlier versions. Even on level roads it seems to jump between gears unnecessarily. It's nice overall, maybe I just had my hopes set too high? </TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked at a variety of SUVs and CUVs, thought the Enclave offered the best conbination of size and ride quality. The vehicle is as quiet and nicely appointed inside as advertised. In essence the quietest and smoothest car I have owned. The transmission issues, in my opinion, are overstated. Shifts are smooth and yes on occasion the transmission does search for the correct gear, but not a deal breaker. The performance is more than adequate. If you want 0-60 stats buy a Ferarri! Fit and finish are excellent. Gas milaeage in mixed driving is disappointing-15mpg. Hard to believe that GM won't permit you to querie the Nav system for gas, food or lodging while moving! Save your money, buy a $300 Garmin.</TEXT>

A thrill to drive after parting with our 2004 Cadillac Deville. Love the seat height, Onstar and the attention we have been getting. Purchased the cargo shade and net and think Buick could have done a better design job on the shade. Love the room as my wife and I intend to do a lot of traveling. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar, quiet and smooth ride. Little or no wind noise. Feeling relaxed with no back ache after a few hours drive. Being able to slide out of and into the seat. Previous vehicle sat too low and being an old timer(well over 70) I can enjoy trips once again. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had my Enclave 1 month and have 600 miles on it. No problems, love it however I purchased the rear shade and don't see that it is worth the price. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seating comfort, smooth and quiet ride and lots of interior room. No children in my family so room for me and my spouse to take what we want on a trip. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought my Enclave because I needed an SUV that had seats that adjust for small adult as well as large. I am the small adult in the family and still have to use a pillow to see over the dash! Nice color brown exterior and dark charcoal interior. Drives like a tank, very heavy metal. Shifting is not right, hence transmission problem. Low road noise with windows closed but then need the AC recirculating feature to stay on in every setting, not. Overall, a good luxury SUV for a big person not sensitive to exhaust and polluted air.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Color, XM radio choices, OnStar, Bose speakers, DVD in the back to watch a movie. All cosmetic. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had this vehicle since Sept and love it. Quiet, smooth ride and a pleasure to drive. Have put 13,000 miles already. Inside is roomy enough for adults to sit in the very back.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's extremely quiet. The ride & handling are superior. It tows our 3500 lb. boat with the greatest of ease. It's truly a beautiful vehicle inside and out, and has all the bells & whistles. Just want to drive it all the time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sunroof & separate skylight. Backup camera & sensors. Power window memory which includes steering wheel & outside rearview mirrors. 2nd row captain chairs. All the different programing available. OnStar.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my 2003 Lexus GX for the Enclave and so far so good. The ride is very smooth. Comparable to the Lexus. Drives like a car, which I like since I also traded my Accord on this vehicle. Figured I only needed one car and the Enclave was the combination of the two I was looking for. Granted it's not a Lexus but so far it's pretty close. I would say it's lacking on acceleration but so far it hasn't been that big of a deal. Gas mileage varies from 14 to 22 and I check it myself, I don't rely on what the info center tells me. Visibility trying to back up is limited and yes I have the back up camera but it makes me dizzy and it's hard to see it in the daytime when its sunny. Overall a winner</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Deep seats- I'm tall, articulating headlights-too cool, XM and Onstar, cupholders and storage, dual sunroof, power liftgate, finally third row seats that fold flat, and let's not forget the Bose radio. Also the power folding mirrors.</FAVORITE>
