<AUTHOR>NISMO 1441</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>If I had to give up my wife of 20 years or NISMO.....oh that'd be tough...That end of the day experience of crawling in the cockpit and ZZZZ'ing up that engine is like therapy. I wanted an 08 before the styling changed...beautiful curves, not a bad angle to the car. Walked in to a dealer on V-day 09 ready to check out the 09s, not really in the market and there was 08 1441 sitting on the floor with $26,500 on the windshield. Are you serious???? Pack it up....and drove it off the showroom floor. My wife looked at it and said, that's all bad, hence my plates "ALL BAD." </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling is incredible.....followed by the motor.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Z and I'm pleased to say that everything about the Z legend is true. The newest VQ35HR engine has legendary horsepower and torque, mated with the 5sp Automatic for legendary reliability, the sound of the exhaust is addictive, the design is an instant classic. Very respectable MPG for a little monster car like this. And cool tuned suspension/ride for the balance between road handling and comfort. Everything I was hoping for and a lot more.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>- Engine and exhaust note - Instant power at any speed, even from standing still - That Classic JDM look (even better looking than the new 370Z or 370ZR)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had the base badboy for 6 months before it was totaled in the rain from doing 45 in a 55mph zone. All I have to say is that this was one of the best cars that I have ever had, I don't think a Porsche would have made me much happier but no matter what you tell yourself it is really only a sunny day kind of car. You already know why you like the car but here are the problems. Base model means no lsd something which is inconceivable on a rwd car of this caliber. Secondly the brakes stink compared to the engine power. Luckily the 370 fixed this issue. The car comes with hid which is nicel and same power as the top end models. Even nismo. . But no LSD or vdc and no brembos. I'm looking into awd</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power. Six spd. Same engine in all models. Nice exhaust. Power at all rpm. High revong engine. Truly a sophisticated pleasure</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a flashy red 2005 350Z ('til hubby wrecked it on a slick road <waaah>). Just bought a 2008 350 (same trim level). Life is good again; it's my daily commute vehicle, and I laughed outloud for the sheer joy of driving again on the way home (on the mountain roads) last night. I like the new steering wheel radio controls; the blind spot doesn't seem as bad as the 2005 version. 'Course that could be because I'm so happy to be zipping around the turns again. WooHoo!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Grippy tires in the curves; love the door cup holders. The fact I can (and do) get two golf bags in the trunk and still look good entering the golf course parking lot.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was given the chance to 'trade-down' from my '07 350Z Roadster Touring (equipped) for a new '08 Nismo "even"///What a difference in handling, speed and fun..it is everthing my old '75 280Z had accentuated to the highest level and then some..The Nismo is for driving and I'm sure would be fun to punish at a track; however, I just like driving it 0-60 (or so) and enjoying the car's superb cornering and acceleration capabilities...I agree with the review about the stereo being poor; but when I put my I-pod adapter in, the stereo was much better..as the speakers 'break-in' the sound improves too...meanwhile I'm just smiling and driving this car more 'happily' than the convertible!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, acceleration, exhaust tone, ease to service, fantastic quality build and components; and moreover it's "limited-edition" status..</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 350Z has all it takes to be an excellent peformance and economical sports car! The handling and pickup is great! The gas miles is great! The look and feel is great! The cost is great! Basically you feel great all around in the 350Z AWESOME street machine! I wouldn't trade it for a Porsche or anything else. If the standard 350Z isn't good enough for you get a 370Z or NISMO. If you want another mint vehicle try the Nissan GTR or Skyline GTR which also in and of itelf can take most every vehicle on or on/off road and put them to shame! Once you try a 350Z or any of the other Nissan power machines you won't want anything else. </TEXT>

<TEXT>OK, I've had the little stinker for 4 days. I traded in my '06 Frontier which I liked very much as far as trucks go, for an '08 Z. What a difference from handling, acceleration, comfort, etc. I haven't driven anything this small since I turned over my '85 Honda Prelude with 300K on the odometer. Looking forward to building quite the relationship with the Z. I'm not looking to get anymore power or handling out of it. I've grown tired of pouring money into cars with aftermarket stuff. So I'm just going to enjoy the car for what is - a fun sports-car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car. Fun to drive but missing a few things. No iPod dock, memory seats, or usable cup holders. The nav system isn't worth it and the stereo sounds good but isn't user friendly. Bluetooth is also flawed, our Acura's system was much better. Power and looks are awesome. Get the windows tinted and a spoiler for the finished look. The car rides low so be prepared to replace the windshield a few times. Limited sight visibility also takes getting used to. Getting around 30 mpg under normal driving conditions. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, power, price. Stereo sounds good. Comfort is good for a small woman and a big man. Handles great. Very easy to wash in driveway</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My base 6M 350Z is a great car. I bought it to replace my 2007 GMC Sierra Denali and 1991 Corvette coupe and I've done well. I've gotten a lot of compliments and nods of approval since owning this car. The Nagaro Red just "pops" in the sunlight. The performance, styling and fuel economy are excellent and I'm sure the reliability will be the same. Although I didn't buy from my local dealer (due to them not having the exact car I wanted (base 6M w/out splash guards), they are eager to service it. You get great mileage when you drive conservatively. Was able to get a great deal due to 370 coming. Overall I'm very, very happy with my decision to purchase a Nissan 350Z.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Perfect blend of handling, power, braking, styling and economy at this price point.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car in July and put appx 3300 miles on since. I just gave it my first oil change. This car is a complete MACHINE! Feels great on the road. Great fuel economy, outstanding performance off the line and from 60+. It's the enthusiast version so it has the limited slip and traction control. Really sticks to the road. Very maneuverable. I test drove the 2008 Mustang GT, Chevy Cobalt SS supercharged, Mazda rx8, Mitsubishi eclipse GT. The 08 350Z Enthusiast just blew them all away. Might have only 2 seats and room for golf bags, but in the end, no one can really fit in the "4 seater sports cars" anyway. Best car I have driven to date. Very happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I think everything has been said about what's great about this car. I took my up to Lake Tahoe from San Francisco and that was the most fun I had in car. It's definitely a driver's car. Note to wives and girlfriends out there: If you are passenger, you might not like it so much. My wife, who usually never gets car sick, did riding as the passenger. It's built very low and you feel everything. Also, if you have a bad back, getting in and out could be a chore.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Z for 2 months and so far it's been a complete thrill to drive. It's fast, yet refined! It turns heads and gets attention. The powerful V6 really kicks and the baritone exhaust sounds melodious especially in higher RPMs. If you drive it smooth (which is VERY hard to do) you can get good mpg, but driving it like a true sports car can cause some frequent trips to the pump. The 6-speed transmission has great response on all 6 gears. All this for under 30K! Best deal out there!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The styling is great and the exhaust is top notch for a stock car. You cannot beat the price tag! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my car for about 3 months now and have enjoyed every minute of it. I've been waiting for several year to get it and it was worth the wait. This was the design I wanted, so I had to go after it before the redesign hits next year. The 6M is very smooth and easy to use. All the interior controls and navigation system are easily accessible and easy to use. The seats are very comfortable, although a little snug compared to a regular passenger car. The head and legroom are excellent. The car is a blast to drive and the exhaust note is very cool.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling and performance are very good. The Rays (18"/19") look great compared to the other trim lines.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I thought the pricing was about right on my new Nismo, until i got it on the track. What a deal for this car. The car handled very well at full steam even being heavy. The new handling package on the Nismo was fantastic. I have raced professional and know the difference between a car that handles and a car that does not. If they could add another say 75-100 hp it would be perfect. I recommend this car as a true value in a market full of over priced sports cars.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I believe this is the best value for your money if you're looking for some performance. If you're looking for practicality, don't get this car. The trunk can be useless. If those are not an issue, get this car! The engine is fabulous and handles spectacularly. The ride is bearable enough for a long road trip, but the clutch is not to my liking (try it and you will see). Gas mileage can be good if sticking it in 6th gear (26 mpg is my best), and it can obviously drain your wallet fast if driven hard.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the engine and exhaust music at higher rpms. It's my favorite song of all time.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>To experience both the normal Z and the NISMO tuned Z, is more than enough for you to quickly decide which is for you. The 2 are very similar interior wise, power wise, and that is where it ends. The nismo, is a much more aggressive/racing type car, yes you can travel, the gas mileage is comparable if you can keep your foot out of it! Good luck with that. The car handles like a dream, you can push it to the edge of your own limits and it still wants more, the stiffer chassis, and upgraded suspension make this car worth the little extra it costs to own, over a normal Z. If you like to drive, and love the road this car is for you!!! If not then I suggest a normal Z. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Body kit, suspension, wheels, although not too much is different, the interior is nice, storage is ample, a little bit of a pain, one of the larger storage areas (lockable) is directly behind the pass. seat. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great performance car with lots of torque and passing power. The seats are a little stiff but with time should soften up a bit. Audio controls are easy to operate and climate controls are the very best I've seen, I love the auto climate feature with seemingly endless supply of fan speeds. Build quality is excellent and rattles are few. A bit like watching a widescreen movie when looking out the rear window. Gas mileage should improve as the engine breaks in (20 mpg city/highway average now). Nissan left very little room for improvement with this newest version of the "Z".</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auto climate controls. Low end power. Auto dimming rear view mirror. Style auto up & down Windows.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought a Touring Roadster about two months ago. Here are the pros: powerful, handles great, roomy for a two seater (interior and trunk), great manual transmission, decent bose stereo, easy top operation, nice stock rims. Cons: poor gas mileage, no telescoping steering wheel, road noise, strange rattle over bumps, poor visibility. All things considered, its a great car. The fun factor far makes up for any imperfections. It feels like a true sports car. It has this "brute power" kind of feeling. Its a little heavy for such a little car, but I like that, it makes the car feel solid and planted to the road. I think for the money, it is a great value. I would highly recommend this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>306 horse power, 6spd, rims, xenons, easy top operation, handling. The seats are firm and supportive, but im unsure how they would feel after a long road trip.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was searching for a car that was a coupe, zippy, stylish, and unique. I found it all with the Nismo. It's a fun car to drive. Everytime you get in it feels like your going to an auto X. I test drove an STI, G35, and RSX's before I found this, and I beleive it is the fastest and best handling out of the 3. The performance is excellent, hands down. The interior is ok. Not fancy because things like leather and power seats add weight. The car has been purpose built. Its also very bumpy ride, because of the seam welded body. However if you like that feeling of being connected to the road like me you will love this. The exhaust roars FYI too. I tell people it runs on diced lions.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, speed. (306 HP 268 TQ is more than enough for regular road driving. I still find myself accidently spinning the wheels every once in a while.) Looks great. Aero kit looks good and is functional over 60 MPH. Seamwelded body. Like the rims on the Nismo as well. Interior acceptable. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my car a year now and I have not had any problems with it. I love the way it handles corners and gets up and goes. It turns heads from the young to the old. At first I did not like the color (Solar Orange) but it quickly grew on me and I have had a ton of compliments. The only reason I got that color is because it was the only 2007 on the lot at the time and I did not want to wait to get it. I have wanted this car for the past 4 years and I am so happy I did. It is worth every penny.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my 2008 Enthusiast Z for a couple of weeks now. So far, I love it! Can't say much about reliability yet, of course, but everything else is good. PROS: F-U-N! It is a blast to drive this car. The engine sounds great, too. You get a 300hp, road-hugging sports car for $30k. Best deal out there. And it turns heads. :-) Plenty of headroom (and I'm 6'4") CONS: Clutch is WAY too long. There's, like, 4-6 inches of play before it engages. You can hear every speck of dirt hit the rear wheel wells. Kinda annoying. Wheel doesn't telescope, which would've made a HUGE difference in leg room for me. Stereo's kinda lame. The fun of driving this car easily makes up for any minor nits! Recommend!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The new Nagaro Red looks awesome and the car handles well. I only have 250 miles but it puts a smile on my face every time I drive it. Had a Nismo cat back exhaust installed prior to delivery and it is the best option you could ever purchase. Sounds awesome, quality build, and is covered by the new car warranty. Looked at vettes and mustangs but their quality was lacking. The extra features like bose stereo, leather heated seats etc are worth the extra money in mp opinion. Drive one and you will buy it!</TEXT>
