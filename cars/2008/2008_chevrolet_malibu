<TEXT>Bought this car when it first came out, there were only 3 on the lot to choose from. Gas mileage is no where close to the commercials. Too small, if you have children, stay away from this car. one car seat and that's about it for the back seat. one stroller in the trunk and no more for the trunk. have been to shop on numerous occasions for brake issues, was sat down by the shop manager and told, "that's just how it is, sorry." Cannot wait til lease ends to get rid of it! will not buy a GM again, first and last experience!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our Chevy used with a little over 18K miles. I fell in love with it when I saw it on the Web and even more so once I took it for a test drive. We've had a problem with the Power Steering and had to have the Steering Column replaced (under Warranty) but not even that makes me sorry for choosing this car. My husband is 6'3" and my son if 6'1". Both of them have plenty of leg room. The color is great, Pewter Gray with Gold iridescent. This is a sleek looking and driving machine. Good going Chevy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I fell in love with this car when it was first launched and really wanted to have one. I thought I was lucky when I got a used one with 13000km on it. It was a gm employee demo car. At 22,000 the car started to pull to the right, dealer couldn't find a problem. At 27000km it was out of line and I had to pay $200 for have cambers installed in order to line it up properly. At 29000km the fan is beginning to go on it. Its a piece of junk. Certainly not worthy of car of the year.It will be my last GM vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Initially, I was a big fan of this car. At about the 5 month mark it simply started to fall apart. I maintain my car to perfection but this car has been in the shop for warranty repairs 7 different times for 7 different reasons. Everything from steering column to the bumper coming loose to computer ships going bad. This car has been an absolute nightmare from the beginning.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well I guess the days of new car first service lists is over! Drove it out of the dealers lots and been going ever since. No complaints here, and i can be a little picky on my cars. For as much as cars cost today it's a true value and stylish to boot. And an added kicker, 20mpg in town and 29 highway loaded up on a trip, well above the mfgs stated economy. This is with the 252 hp v-6. Love the car and @ 63years old I've been through a few. Keep it coming GM, well done</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2008 Malibu LTZ 6 months ago and since then I've received no less than 8 compliments on the vehicle from total strangers. I stopped keeping track after a while, but one guy wouldn't believe it was a Chevy and a girl at a drive-thru practically climbed through the drive-thru window to admire the two-tone interior. Runs great, handles great, and looks great. Worth every penny in my opinion!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a used Malibu LT with 18,100 miles on it and have had for just over four months. Car has been great...I have a 100 mile daily commute (roundtrip) and have put 12,000 miles on the car in 4 months. Zero problems. Car has been terrific. XM is great, interior looks awesome and the ride is very smooth if you put up your windows you hear nothing outside. This was my first car purchase and I am beyond happy with it so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased my 08 LTZ MALIBU,black with peanut butter interior ,before vacation last. We were able to place 2 sets of golf clubs, & luggage in the trunk. The car is great, fuel economy is great. Had a 01 Cadillac, wanted a new 08 CTS. compared the Mailbu with the CTS, practically same car for $20, 000 less. Glad we purchased the Malibu, if I only get passerbys to stop leaving finger prints on the windows when they peak in to look at the interior.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Previously owned a VW Passat and still own a 5 series, BMW, this car has been a joy. Stop and go mileage has been around 21-22, which is OK. We have the 2LT. Have not had much opportunity for long distance hwy to see how hwy mileage is. No problems at all with the car. Very quiet and comfortable. Wife loves the OnStar, we use it for directions all the time. Car handles very well, braking is great. Have received many compliments on the vehicle, even from friends who own Lexus, etc. Test drove other Japanese makes and the Malibu blew us away.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After being in a 2003 BMW 325i with countless problems and loud wind noise this car was a wonderful surprise. I test drove the Camry and Honda and was all set to purchase the Camry but after getting into the Malibu there was no turning back. I was not expecting to purchase an American car but when I got in it there was no comparison. the ride is smooth, quiet and the interior is the best. If Chevrolet can transform all their cars into one with this much quality the competition needs to watch out!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a joy to drive. Mine is 2LT and the list of options for this level is amazing. I compared the Camry, Accord, Altima, actually I looked at everything from small cars to luxury cars, the Malibu is probably the best value in the marketplace. My criteria was to get a car that was comfortable, fun to drive and gets good fuel economy. The 4 cyl has plenty of power and that power is smooth. Initially I was concerned about getting a 4sp auto when others offer a 5 or 6sp with a 4cyl but this trans shifts so smoothly and works so well with the power generated from this engine. This car is so quiet, very little road noise. Test drive this car before you buy, you'll be glad you did.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride, looks, excellent design both inside and out. OnStar and XM radio are great also. I really like the seats in the 2LT, the fabric looks rich and the seats are very comfortable and they are heated. I really like the heated seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I would like to know how the public is being fooled about poor mileage from GM cars. I set the cruise at 55 and get 38 mpg on the instant mpg readout and at 70 mph I get 35, aprox. 26 in the city. and this isn't a tiny car. Plenty of room and I'm 6 ft 2 in. Beautiful car, absolutely quiet. A great ride. An excellent car at a great price. I highly recommend to everyone to test drive a Malibu.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the best vehicle I have ever owned. My wife and I took it on a 300 mile road trip on the first weekend which included drive time in the Colorado Mountains and on the highway, and it performed wonderfully. Even with the mountain driving, and allowing my brother in-law to road test it with his lead foot we got 28.7 mpg on that first tank. We were in the midst of some kind of biker rally on this road trip, and there was a rock band playing at one of the stops. I saw them out of the window, but couldn't hear them, I rolled down the window and there was the loud noise. I felt like I was in a car commercial. Looks great, rides great, couldn't be happier.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Now, after having this vehicle for 6 months, I dare to say that this car is the most fun to drive car since my 56 Bel-Air. It rides like a much bigger car than it is and is as quiet as my previous Cadillac. And recently I have had the opportuniy to take it on a few road trips and have gotten over 30 mpg on each trip. The car is amazing both in ride, handling and power. The seats are comfortable and easy on the back. Anyone looking for a great car that would be doing themselves a disservice if they don't check this one out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at several cars before buying including CTS, Lexus GS350, Acura TL, Honda and Maxima. I test drove this one and felt the others weren't worth the extra money. LTZ version is awesome. Everything about it was well done, high quality materials on interior, great engine and ride, good looks and you absolutely cannot beat the price. GM did an awesome job on the redesign of this car. I honestly feel it is comparable to many higher priced imports. Standard features makes for an easy purchase. I'm extremely happy to say that I bought an American car. I strongly encourage all potential buyers to test drive this car before purchasing a Honda, Acura, Nissan or other. You'll be pleasantly surprised</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of leg room, front and back. Looks, engine, ride, XM radio - everything about the car is A+. Based on pricing of other cars and what you get with the LTZ you would think this should be $35,000+.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just recently purchased a new Malibu LTZ. First off, the look of the car is wonderful. Very classy inside and out. GM did everything right with this one. The comfort while driving to the spaciousness of the vehichle is great! I have a 4 month old son, and the space is definitely needed. With raising gas prices the Malibu was a much better bet then the Tahoe I was originally looking at. With this being the 3rd Chevy that I have owned..Cobalt SS, and TrailBlazer SS...I'm still completly satisfied with Chevys! For the price range there is nothing more that I can ask for. I have the sunroof, heated seats, remaote start, plenty of places to put stuff. I couldnt ask for anything more.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the 6 speed manual paddle shift. Being that I have a child now, and its not very comfortable to put him in the Cobalt SS. The manual shifting on the Malibu is very nice!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had the car for about a month and so far so good. Traded in a TrailBlazer and getting good returns as far as better mileage. 1LT with sunroof and power convenience package, Sandstone color - very sharp! Smooth ride, quiet engine, decent mileage so far (22-25 mpg in mixed driving). Eye-catching interior and every feature you might need. Also looked at Sonata and Altima and this was the best choice for me. Only minuses so far are turning radius (seems like the TrailBlazer could turn tighter), no rear seat armrest, and small trunk opening. I'm 6'2" and it took a little while to find a comfortable seat postion but no compaints now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my new Malibu in May and I love it! I had a Chevy TrailBlazer which I also loved, but traded it for a Dodge Caliber due to gas mileage. I hated giving up my luxury of the TrailBlazer and truly missed it. After buying the Malibu, I don't miss my Blazer as much. The Malibu has a feel of luxury without the price tag. I love the looks, the handling, and the comfort. The only thing I can say I don't like about the Malibu are the blind spots, but I know they're there and just need to be a little more careful. I would highly recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had the car a week, but I am impressed! I was looking at Altima and Sonata, but when I drove the Malibu, it was no contest. I can't believe the difference between this car and the 2007. Unbelievably quiet and comfortable. Interior is very nice - as good as many cars costing much more. I have filled up twice and got 30mpg and 31mpg with mostly highway commute miles. Plenty of power for me. Exterior styling is beautiful. Clean lines, great looks, everything goes together well. With so many standard features, I couldn't believe the price. The last GM product I bought was in 1988. I'm glad to see GM is back in the game - and winning the game in my opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Had a low mileage 04 Explorer, so I was looking for better gas mileage and a better payment. Found both in the 08 Malibu. I drove the Malibu and loved it. I ended up buying a program car with only 9500 miles. Shortly after buying it, I drove 83 miles to another city. Mileage calculator showed 37.6 avg mpg hwy. I forgot that the trip to this city was slightly down hill. The return trip showed 34 avg.mpg. Very pleased and the car is ultra quiet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>No reason to buy a Toyota with the Malibu here. We actually bought an LTZ with a 4 cyl. engine and the 6 speed transmission. This is a new feature for the Malibu. Now you have great looks with the LTZ and a great fuel economy. Plenty of power and acceleration with the 4. I have owned a Toyota Camry and this car has it beat handsdown. No wonder the Chevolet dealers can't keep them in stock! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Coming from a guy who is used to driving a Duramax it was a big step to get a mid-sized car. But this one is unreal. The Malibu is sporty to drive, yet has plenty of room for my family of 4. I drive 200 miles a day and average 29 miles per gallon at 75 mph with criuse and the 3.6L engine. The ride is excellent and quiet. The sound system rocks and with the onstar phone I can pay more attention to the driving. The only thing I can say needs improvement is the side to side leg room could be greater, but again I am used to driving a crew cab. Overall a great car. I think our company is making this one the standard.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall this car is absolutely fantastic. I have had it for three weeks and it is very pleasing. I marked a 9 on my fuel economy only because I went from a Neon. This is a bigger car, but I would prefer a little better city fuel economy (about 22 stop and go). It's not too bad though. When you get on the highway it's 30-31. My fiance completely loves this car as well. He wishes he could have it. This is my first brand new car and I am in love. I was looking at Camry's and Altimas but I wanted to buy a GM and I can honestly say with reviews and such, I think this is anticipated to last as long if not longer than Toyota/Honda/Nissan. I believe this is very possible. Great purchase!!!</TEXT>

I test drove the camry, Honda, Mazda6, Altima. As far as I am concerned it had the best ride of them all, great value for the money. The 4 cylinder is suprisinly peppy. Fit and finish are excellent. The car turns heads where ever I go. People ask what are you driving? The cabin is quiet with no wind noise on the highway. So far 26.5 local mpg and 31 highway!

<TEXT>I have had three different cars so far in my life, and I can say that this car is worth a lot more than I paid for it. My monthly payments are only $200 a month, and I get 30 MPG. I have never felt so grateful to have a car, and I have never ever felt this safe, and comfortable in a car. Not to mention, I have never had a car so luxurious (and I don't even have the model that's been supped-up). The basic model is already equipped as a luxury car. OnStar is amazing and comes standard, and I have a car phone which makes me feel safe. It has a 5 star frontal, and side crash test rating. I will probably own another one of these in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had minivans, Envoys and trucks so it was time to get a car as the family is leaving the nest. We almost purchased a CTS but then saw the Malibu drove it and then ordered one. Ours is black with black and brick interior and everyone that rides in the car loves it. It is fun just to get into it and drive. The mileage is almost 24 combined city and highway. If you are thinking of any mid sized car you better give this a look because I don't think there is a better car for the money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was thinking about leasing a new car between the Altima, Accord, Malibu And the Camry, after my test drive on all, I chose the Malibu. I felt like I was driving a Lincoln when it came to comfort, the exterior styling is a beautiful combination of modern class. I don't stop hearing compliments on my car. I'm sorry Toyota and Nissan there's nothing to compare. GM must continue the good work in order to get their reputation back, because I keep on hearing from my friends that the reason they don't want any American brand car is because they're unreliable. My recent car was a Camry and it was full of problems. Thank God I only leased it. I think its time to give a second chance! </TEXT>

<TEXT>08 red LTZ with all avialable options. Wow. I can honestly say that driving a mid-size sedan really can be fun and comfortable and done in a well appointed interior. The ride is amazing. Cabin noise is the first thing I noticed, in that there was hardly any. Smooth and responsive,its just a blast to be in. Styling, both interior and exterior are eye catching. Creatue comforts abound in this car, many of them standard. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Ample power to get me to and from the ski slopes at much better fuel efficiency than the Jeep I traded. The LS is getting about 20 miles/gallon on a 3-mile commute to work but reaches the high-20s in highway driving. I can set the cruise on 65 or 70 mph even on a climb to a Colorado pass without causing the 4-cylinder engine to whine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have fallen in love with this car. Have had over a month. People go ga ga over it.I am 6 ft 1/2 in tall weigh 265 lbs. The interior is so comfortable for me. It is so put together right. Fit and finish makes me feel like I bought a luxury car. Wish I could write a book about it because I think I could. Not to say bad about anything else but this is my dream car. Mileage with half and half (half city..half county no high way driving) is 27. Must say I am very pleased. Most new cars were off quickly but this just makes me feel better the more I drive it . My wife likes to drive trucks but she is falling for the Malibu also.</TEXT>

<TEXT>3 months into ownership, I can say that I really like this car. I am coming from a Malibu Maxx, and this is much better in every way. The styling inside and out is first rate, the car feels solid, the engine has a nice 'growl' when you hit the gas, and the ride is smooth yet firm. This car is pretty darn fast! I do like the Turn by Turn navigation (it works pretty well), although I don't feel I will sign-up at $25+/mo. when the free subscription ends. I have been putting in 89 octane, and this does get me better mileage and pickup than 87 octane. I have owned Acuras and Volvos the past 10 years, and this is the only car that has received compliments from complete stran</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the styling (although a little boring from directly behind), the interior features like 2-tone leather, the optional red jewel color, the radio, and the Turn-By-Turn. I like that this car has some personality compared to the Acoords and Camrys out there, and is competitively priced.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We considered others but felt the Malibu's 4cyl test drive was better than the 6cyl on other makes. It is a comfortable, quiet, luxurious drive! Controls are easy to use. I love it that the remote starter also turns on the rear window defroster which is great when you live in Buffalo, NY! I love the free OnStar with hands free calling and GPS access. I wish the mileage was better. I drive more hwy than city and I only get 20 mpg overall. I wish the cupholders were more convenient to use and there was a better place for my purse when I have a passenger. I've only had it for 2 months, but I think it's going to be hard for me to ever have to give it up! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've driven a 1988 Chevy Monte Carlo for 7 years, and I've loved it. Every car I've driven that's been built since 1995 I have hated. It never felt like you could just sit back and relax in it. I'm 6ft 1 and would either have my knees in the dash or head in the roof. Finally the ol' Monte Carlo became undependable and I am thankful to have found a car that fits the bill! I have the v-4 which is suprisingly quick and averaged 35 mpg on a four hour highway trip. I feel like this is the Apple Computer of cars, everything just works like you'd naturally expect it to.The brakes feel right, the automatic functions are perfect and the drive is fun!</TEXT>

I love the dashboard layout, the odometer is cool how it lights up, and I love all the secret compartments. The cupholders are great and I don't have to worry about my drinks falling over anymore. I'm still getting used to the 4-cyl power but it's actually not too bad. I have gotten so many compliments on this car already and I have only had it a week!

<TEXT>Since it's introduction, I have been intrigued. I recently got out of my 2006 Trail Blazer (which my wife & I loved!) and leased the 2LT 4CYL. I wanted the 6CYL, but was too impatient to wait for an incomming vehicle! We are pleasantly surprised with the smoth operation of the 4CYL. The ride is just amazing. The car looks and feels like a luxury vehicle! As a sales person who loves the Chevrolet Brand - It is embarassing how surprised I am! I am not surprised, however, that I have seen many luxury brand owners interested in the Malibu! The car is just that nice.

<TEXT>We purchased this car in late 2007 after considering the Altima and Camry for several months. We just fell in love with the styling of this car and value for the money. Once we test drove it there was no turning back. We have the V6 LTZ - which I'd say is the only way to go with this car -- and so many features are standard. This car handles like a dream and we get so many compliments on the looks. In my town we are still part of the very few who have this car and it seems to turn heads wherever we go.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Here is my review after 2 months/2000 miles. Car is rock solid; paddle shifters are effective and make driving fun again, even in a midsize sedan. Turn-by-turn Nav is not bad, but glad it's free for now. Gas mileage has settled around 23.5 mpg in mixed driving. Driver comfort is excellent with all the available adjustments. Extra storage areas really come in handy. Remote start is a great feature, but key fob has not worked a few, unrepeatable times. I have no real need for sunroof; would definitely buy this car again w/rear power pkg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Malibu is a fun car to drive. Coming from a Volvo I was reluctant to even consider a domestic. Then I test drove the Malibu and I was hooked. I really preferred the LTZ but the mileage at 17 mpg city is not great so I bought the LS and I was pleasantly surprised with its zippy performance. The car resplendent inside and out. With the two-tone cocoa and cashmere after market leather we installed the LS looks as good as, if not better, than the LTZ. Neighbors and friends are jealous. They can?t believe the luxury features on this car for less than $21,000 (leather included). Oh, I smoked an Acura TL that brought a pleasing and satisfying smile to my wife?s face. It was almost orgasmic.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The XM radio and OnStar are great features. I have already received an OnStar diagnostic email that says that my tire pressure in the right front at 28 psi is under-inflated and should be brought up to the recommended 30 psi. Wow! isn?t technology great? </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned from Hondas to Mercedes and everything in between. Normally I stay away from American cars like plague. This time, I can say that they definitely got it right and can compete with Accord and Camry. The ride is better than Camry and more luxurious than Accord. Fits and finishes are at par with Japanese cars. The real problem with American car companies is that they are doing the same thing over and over again, producing craps but not this time. Honda Fit 1.5L gets 30MPG and this 2.4 Malibu is far better than Fit or Civic or Accord. See it for yourself and go take a test drive. I'd highly recommend this car to those who are looking at Japanese imports. Kudos to Chevy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>...that GM puts together a car that can compete with the imports. I have been waiting for Chevrolet to give me a reason to consider them again. The design and reviews got me in the dealership. The test drive sold me. My four year lease was up on my 2004 Passat Turbo (another review for another day). For the past year I was planning on getting a loaded Accord or Acura TL. After driving them all, I decided to give Chevy a chance again. This car is right on par with the other brands. It actually drives nicer than the Accord, in my opinion, with nicer controls as well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a luxury SUV owner, but wanted a 2nd "smaller" vehicle to just hop in and go. But you can't take the luxury out of a person, so I looked long and hard to find a car I wanted. And this car is it! It's a real joy to drive - very comfortable, quiet, and handles beautifully. The front seats seem to envelop you and the lumbar support is nice. The sound system is just as nice as my Denali's 9-speaker Bose system. I hesitated with the ebony/brick interior, wondering if I would get sick of it, but the opposite is true. I like it more every day. The interior lines with the contrasting colors are very sharp and pleasing to the eye.The swooping dashboard lines give the interior a more open feel</TEXT>

If your looking at a midsize car, and don't feel like being Accord/Camry no. 4574 on your block, this is a good buy. Even if your deadset on the Honda, I'd step into a Chevy dealer, if only to find out what else is out there. You might be surprised</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had an '08 Malibu LS 4-cylinder sedan for a month as an insurance replacement rental. The car is somewhat elegant looking, with an attractive looking interior. The 2.4 four and automatic has enough power for most situations - I'm averaging 24.5 mpg in mixed city/freeway driving. Interior is quiet and large, but materials used are poor - center console is cheap plastic and squeaks, the console lid was fixed once before but it's loose again. The bottom of the driver's door panel is misaligned, squeaks on bumpy roads, and is made of ultra-cheap plastic. Windshield header leaked water in the car wash. Large trunk, but no rear center armrest - seats fold down instead. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Awesome car! I never thought I'd be able to own a luxury performance sedan, but this car is unbelievable! I know it's not in the same class as a Mercedes AMG, but for the price (I got mine for $26,700 w/sunroof!) you cannot find a better combination of performance, luxury, and space! The leather seats cradle you like you're the most important person on earth. The cabin noise is so quiet you can use your inside voices at 75 mph on crummy northwest interstates. The premium audio system (8 speakers) successfully competes with Bose systems. I am truly impressed with this vehicle and all of the frills that GM includes (OnStar, roadside assistance, warranties, etc.) I'm 100% satisfied and happy!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This car offers the looks and comfort levels to compete with the big luxury companies without the mortgage sized payments!

<TEXT>We've had this car for about 2 weeks now and so far so good. We took a trip from San Diego, CA to Santa Barbara, CA up I-5 to the 101, which both have horrible traffic, and thoroughly enjoyed the trip. We traded in a Trailblazer that we did not like so I questioned going with another Chevrolet but I'm glad we did. The build quality, comfort level, appearance, and amenities make for a great package. They've done their research and took the time to put out something that wasn't thrown together. I agree with the critics that say they had put all their eggs in one basket with the truck/SUV market but it seems they've produced a winner making for some good competition.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ebony/brick interior, horsepower, sound system, quiet ride are some great features.

<TEXT>I have been driving Malibus for a long time. This has been the nicest one I ever got. I traded in my 2004 Malibu and got a good trade in value for that car too. This car rides so smooth and you have plenty of pick up for a 4 cylindar car. My last one was 6 and I can barley tell the difference in the pick up. The gas milage is much better too. I love the XM radio and the OnStar which I did not have before. The controls for the radio on the steering wheel are nice and the hands free phone service. My car seat fits well in the back and leaves plenty of room for two more people to sit. The trunk holds a lot and is easy to load. I love my new Malibu</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is an incongruous value and a delight to own. They have started out with great basics - a hydroformed version of the Epsilon chassis (rock solid and ultra low resonance), the drivetrain right out of the Caddy CTS (the GM High Feature V6 can run without coolant, like the Northstar). They built on this with no shortage of great features and amenities, in a package with style and grace. Minute details such as the door position stops, the trunk lid mechanism, the tiny lamps inside the door handles, tiny Chevy logos in the lights, all add up to a car that delights like no other. Love the suspension and handling as well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Incredibly quiet and smooth Tight body seams and "Island Hood" Great sound system with XM. Email diagnostics via OnStar, including sound system.

<TEXT>When I decided to take the plunge, my new Malibu was about 10 days out from arriving at the dealership. Honestly, I was like a little kid waiting. I have not had one moment's regret, nor anything but absoulte driving pleasure since I picked up my car. Mileage improves with each fill up. I have about 1800 miles on my car after one month. This is the best built passenger car that Chevrolet division has ever prodeced. I have owned 5 new Nissans and 2 new Dodges since 1995. I can't say that I have ever truly been proud of my ride until now. The ultralux interior is comfortable and impressive to all who have seen it. I felt the package for the price was a steal. Totally underpriced!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride, handling, especially the interior noise level is worthy of cars twice the price.

<TEXT>We recently purchased the new '08 Malibu LT w/ the 2LT package after test driving multiple sedans. We tried the LT with the 4cyl engine but the pickup was atrocious. Also, the electric steering feels too sensitive while at the same time feeling sluggish. The V-6 engine on the other hand has ample power. The hydraulic steering compliments the additional power with more responsiveness and better feel. On the other hand, the TapShift rarely seems to come in handy. It can be quite difficult to feel when you need to shift, so you often find yourself trying to read the tachometer (which shouldn't be necessary in a sedan such as this one). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar, powerful engine, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shifter, ambient lighting, quiet ride, impressive sound system (paid extra), and roomy trunk and rear seating.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned a Camry and an Accord. When I went in to test-drive for a new vehicle, I hadn't even considered the Malibu. A friend's father (who used to be a loyal Camry fan) suggested that I try out the Malibu before buying the Camry I had picked out. Wow! It quickly won me over! I got way more car for the money! I've had many people tell me it looks like a Lexus or other more expensive car. I'm very pleased with my purchase and glad I could buy something domestic and feel happy with the quality. Although I haven't had the car long, I've already been recommending it to all my friends.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are the heated seats, OnStar, radio controls on the steering wheel, and remote starting. The Corvette looking dashboard with teal blue lighting is very nice too! I also love all the compartments to store sunglasses.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car a few weeks ago. I like the sound the doors make when it is closed - feels snug and tight. The standard safety options are great: stability control, air bags everywhere (curtain, torso, and front), traction control / abs, and OnStar. The car is quiet, corners very well, and takes bumps in amazing fashion. It is stylish, the lines are nice and the wheels/times are too cool. The seats are comfortable. The 4 cylinder engine is plenty for me. I had a Honda Civic that I traded in during the purchase of the Malibu. This car is by far superior. The Malibu rides so smoothly that I steer to the bumps and you cannot feel a thing. The Malibu is quiet too. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had this vehicle for about three weeks now and we are thoroughly pleased with the quiet interior, ride and all over appearence of the car. Had our first extended highway trip of approximately 200 miles and attained 30 miles per gallon, which was what I was hoping to get. If this car is as reliable as our 2005 Impala has been for the first 52,000 miles then Chevrolet has another winner. This will be the 12th Chevy that we have owned and I haven't had a bad one yet even the ones we've kept for 14 years or 200,000 miles on the remainder.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The ride of this vehicle is amazing compared to some of the other midsizes that I test drove. The 4 cyl has enough power to get on the highway and doesn't feel like it is struggling to keep up. The interior is extremely quiet and has plenty of room. There are so many compartments that keep your things secure and out of sight. For as little as I paid it compared favorably to cars that were thousands of dollars more but I didnt feel like I was getting any return on my money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Onstar turn by turn navigation. You get a year of free use which I didn't think I would use but have found myself pushing the blue button several times just because I could. XM radio is awesome and also free. Great warranties! Tons of favorite features I cant name them all.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My new 2008 Malibu 2LT with the 3.6L V-6 is truly a standard-bearer for GM. I was not considering purchasing a domestic car until driving this amazing automobile. This car boasts 252 h.p. coupled with a versatile six-speed automatic that has quick, sure shifts and propels you quickly from zero to sixty. I've owned Nissan's and Honda's and this is just as solid with marked improvement in quality control, performance and materials. My wife has a BMW X-3 and 525-I and this car compares favorably to those vehicles which are twice the price. I love the XM and OnStar which only adds to the incredible value in this sports sedan. Chevy hits a home-run and levels the paying field.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM radio (3 mos. free trial), OnStar (free service for 1 yr. with turn-by- turn navigation), great seats, beautiful interior design and layout, powerful V-6, excellent workmanship. This, in my opinion, is the best looking sport-sedan design in the 23K- 30K range which, is unique and distinctive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Test drove the lt1 and found it to be a fantastic deal with only one flaw. The electric steering on this car is not right. It seems to over steer for every correction the driver makes and thus creating a constant moving of the wheel to keep a straight line. The electric steering definitely needs some fixing here and I doubt that gm is going to jump on that for this model. Best bet is to get the v6 with the standard hydro steering. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Many of us have been waiting for an American car that is built with quality craftsmanship, superior performance, and smart styling. Be assured that the day has arrived- the Malibu is the real deal. I traded my '01 VW "New" Passat, and while I loved that car, it became very expenisve to maintain and was less than reliable. This car handles very similar (may even be better), has 60 more horsepower, and has similar quality feel and smart styling- all for +$2,000 less than I paid for my VW 7 years ago!! This car has lively acceleration, is very comfortable and quiet, and handles extremely well. Couple that with very smart, modern styling, an afordable price and you have a mid-size leader!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent interior and exterior styling; smooth, powerful VVT engine; manual shift option; quality construction and solid feel; good sound system with XM 6 CD changer and OnStar for 1 year. The two tone Brick/Black leather really makes a statement. Finally the best feature- American pride!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did a great deal of research on several makes and models. I was able to load up the Malibu for thousands of dollars less than what I would have paid for the Altima, Accord or Camry. I feel like I have plenty of room for my family of 5. I was amazed at how much leg room there is in the back seat. I wouldn't hesitate putting 2 adults in the back seat. I waited for the Mailibu to hit the show room floor before I orded one. I wanted to make sure the quality of the interior met my expectation. I was concered that the low sticker price meant low quality. I was very impressed with the quality and ordered the car right away. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the heated seats, stereo and 12 months of free OnStar service. I also really like the quick (as in really fast) and quiet ride. There is very little wind or road noise. The car just looks great inside and out. I love all the details. Chevrolet did a fantastic job with this car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We had to order the specific car we wanted since none of the nearby dealers had an LTZ in Amber Bronze. It took only 4 weeks for the car to arrive and even though we have only put a few hundred miles on the vehicle, we absolutely love it. The cabin is so quiet and the ride so smooth that I can't believe we are in a mid sized car. If this car is as reliable as my 2005 Impala, which has 53,000 miles and has never had a thing done to it, then we have made an excellent decision for our second car. I cannot judge the fuel economy yet as I have not had a chance to put it on the road for an extended drive. This will happen though in January when we will take it to Miami.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love cars but not an "autophile". Was surprised by materials and fit/finish of the interior/exterior on Malibu; quality materials well executed. Drove 200 miles first day; city, freeway, ortega highway at night; satisfied with ride, handling and power. Ride is quieter than expected, more power than expected and more oversteer/pitch/roll than expected. It's no BMW but neither is the msrp. To me the int/ext looks better than Accord but not Mercedes. The ride/handling compare to Accord but not Merc. Quality seems as good or better than both. I'm amazed with Malibu for the price..10k less cash but not car compared to Merc. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The 250hp feels great. It can get out of its own way. I love the TAP shift. It is lots of fun. I am getting around 20.5mpg with a good mix of highway and stop and go. (My lead foot does not help) When I get a little crazy it gets into the 18mpg range. It holds the road well in the rain and it did well last week in a dusting of snow. Curious to see how it does in a good snow storm. From what I have read the Goodyear tires were not rated well for snow. Fit and finish are great. The car is quiet. I have driven with the radio off and had it around 100 and was amazed at how quiet it is inside. Acceleration and passing at highway speed is very good even in automatic. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Over the past 15 months, I went from a 2004 Honda Accord coupe to a 2007 Chevy Tahoe to the 2008 Malibu. I loved my Tahoe, but with gas prices at $3 + I couldn't afford the 11 mpg I was averaging for much longer. I traded it for the Malibu and although I miss the room in the Tahoe, the Malibu certainly provides all that I need with an 8-year-old son and a 5-month-old daughter. Great handling, nice smooth ride, and really nice looking straight from the factory. So far I am extremely pleased with my decision to trade the "hoe" in for the "bu", if anything changes, I'll be sure to update you! Happy Holidays!</TEXT>

Windows developed to reduce cabin noise. Exterior lights very attractive and new. Doors shut with good sound meaning well built. Blinkers built into front fenders for warning other vehicle on road of lane changes and turns. Air bags in sides of car a plus for my 16 year old driver. Plus extra steel cage built into cage of vehicle. Probably built safer than any car at or near it's price range. 17inch wheels make this car look sharp.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have been waiting for a sporty and roomy sedan like the '08 Malibu. Just purchased recently and we are very pleased so far. It has the largest rear legroom we have seen so far in it's class. Even more than the Impala due to the way the front seats are constructed with an indentation in the back of the seat. Very quiet interior. We went with the 4cyl instead of the 6, but it has a surprising amount of power. Excellent trunk space and if you do need more room there is a 60/40 fold down rear seat. Vehicle handling is decent and it is a relatively smooth ride. The new interior and exterior styling is what stands out for me. Chevy did a great job with that.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Chevy has done a great job in the redesign of the Malibu. The Malibu has lots of room for tall folks, I stand at 6'5" and can stretch my legs out sitting in the drivers seat. The telescoping steering column allows me to see the console, a great plus. The gas mileage is great, I am getting 34.5 mpg on the highway. It drives smoothly, is much more quiet than many other auto brands in the midsize class. The LS has a 4 cyl. that does great with acceleration. I purchased the vehicle at 30,000 miles, and it still looks great. No paint chips or fading. I would recommend this for anyone looking at midsize vehicles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a used 08 ltz, 6cyl with 21k. I like the look and the fit and finish of the interior with leather. The ride is impressive for a medium size car. The car handles well and the 6cyl pulls very good when asked to perform. I have put 5k miles on it and avg 25.5 mpg with a combination of city and highway driving. Overall I am very impressed with the car and only have two small complaints. One the roof line is very low and getting in and out you have to keep your head down (I am 6ft 1). Two when really pushing down hard on the gas the tires feel like they are in a groove and pull no matter what type of surface your on.

<TEXT>I had abandoned Chevy in 2001, having back to back Nissans (Maxima & Altima) until 2008, when I was lured back to Chevy with heavy incentives. "The Car You Can't Ignore" ads were on every 5 minutes. The car was fun at first, but I swear it gets less responsive the more I drive it. Acceleration is reluctant, and steering is stiffer than when new. Just found out the steering gear is failing at only 16K miles. Rear seat doesn't latch properly, and if you stare at the sheet metal too hard, you can dent it with sheer will-power. (how did I get a door-ding on the roof?) No tactile response on the center stack; you have to take your eyes off the road to operate heater/radio. I tried, GM/Chevy......</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for 4 months and love it. The body styling and wheels, along with tinted windows, give it a sporty look that I appreciate. The ride is smooth, quiet, and the engine cruises at 70 without thinking. Watch your speed as you have plenty of power with the 6 cylinder. Heated leather seats are worth the money. Get them! Averaging 24 mpg on urban commute (40 miles round trip). Sound system is only downside as it sounds like a 'stock' radio, while rest of car says "premium." Small antenna also often can't keep weak FM signals. Have also noticed transmission hesitates for split second if step on it to merge. Takes getting used to, but then you are traveling 70 mph. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice body styling and powerful engine. Leather seats are essential on this car. They make interior complete. Plenty of room, and auto-headlights is super convenient. Interior is quiet on road. Oil-change calculator and tire pressure read-out are neat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my Malibu about 7 months, unable to see past the passenger side mirror and door frame (with a Pillow). I knew I would have this problem when I bought it just thought I needed a pillow. Well after forcing my self to drive the car (all of the 9 times that I have), I almost hit some one every time. I do love the car I just cannot see. Because of this safety hazard, I am unsatisfied with this car. My husband is the only person that drives it, unless I have to run around the corner or something and it?s blocking my truck. I drive my old XL7. I cannot trade the car, I will be upside down $8000.00 just stuck with a cute car that?s just Cute to me. Do not buy if your 5'4 and under</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have been driving this car for over a year now. Love it completely. Considering its weight against Camry and Accord, the gas mileage is super at both highway and local. The body style is stunning. When I was waiting for green, I got people on the next lane complimenting the car several times. The interior is better than Japanese cars also, in my opinion. Options are cheaper too. Engine is from Europe, very reliable. Car runs very smooth after a year. The only complaint I have is the trunk entry is a little bit narrow. I can not even put my laundry basket in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Okay, if you have two kids then you need a larger vehicle. The trunk is deep but not high enough to get a double stroller in and out and it takes up half of the trunk. In fact you can't get much in due to the height of the trunk :( The shiny trim blinds you when the sun hits it. The mileage has not been great and have never got more than 26 mpg. As far as the paint job, it's poor! I have several factory runs. Chevrolet let that one slip through the factory. Are they sleeping on the job? </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The feature I love and sold me on the car was the moveable pedals; being short, this is a plus! I really like the XM radio.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my Malibu LT2 for about 4 months now. I am very pleased with the car, even with the 4 banger it still is able to get up and run if i ever need it and for the gas mileage I get 30-31 highway and 26-27 mix with about 60% highway. The leather seats with the suede fabric in the middle is what sold me on the car. It is silly luxury for a car at this price. I also love the hvac and stereo controls. They look good and are very easy to understand and use. I recently had someone try to break into my car by going through the driver side front window and they were not able to break their way through the laminated glass! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the Malibu for about 6 months and 6000 miles. Wife & I use the car mostly on weekends & road trips. We both love the car because of the exterior and interior styling, and performance of the V6. Average fuel economy for all of my driving to date is 26+ MPG. Car color is Sandstone Metallic plus I have a pin strip down the sides. My LTZ draws attention from people driving much more expensive vehicles. The headlights are the best of any vehicle I've owned as the light is widespread evenly (not lumpy lights). We've enjoyed the remote start a few times this winter. No problems.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car has just passed 13,000k's and started with a transmission problem (4 speed tranny). The revs jump up and down as many as 400 rpm when crusing regardless if your using cruse control or not. The dealership say they can't find anything wrong!! Also, the dash lights have a bad habbit of going out on a frequent basis, completley blacking out the instrument panal. Is there a recognized modification or repair for the tranny issue? Is there a lemon law in Canada?</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I have only owned our 2008 Malibu LTZ for a couple of months, but from what we have seen so far it is the nicest car we have ever owned. Being the top of the line Malibu, it has all kinds of neat features and so far they all work flawlessly. The car has great acceleration and takes the curves like it is glued to the road. It also gets great highway mileage. I topped off the tank until gas was at the top of the filler tube, drove 92 miles and topped it off again with only 2.8 gallons. That equates to about 32 mpg which is 6 mpg higher than the 26 mpg rating. The 92 mile trip was 95 percent freeway with the cruise set at 70 mph. This car also gets lots of looks!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am thrilled with my Malibu LT. I got bored easily with Accord, Toyotas, Jetta, etc. Malibu is an excellent traveling car - rides securely, corners great; no bobble-head ride like in the 2009 Corolla XLE (same price!). It is quiet, with an excellent stereo (you can enjoy dance music) and cold A/C - not like the weak A/C on many cars. When I needed to tow a U-Haul, I bought a hitch and wiring for my Malibu - it's a secure and stable tower. That is because Malibu is a stout, well-engineered vehicle that has the extra braking strength, and suspension capability built-in. The interior looks more expensive than it is - same outside. I couldn't find a better sedan for the money. Pittsburgh won the 2009 Super Bowl - could they be better? The Malibu is a seriously great car. My family and friends like it too - even though they drive Nissan Altima, 3 series BMW, and Cadillac CTS. Did I mention the fuel mileage is good? Hint: Premium perks it up if you're in the mood.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent handling, compliant ride, cold A/C, quiet and 'tight' body, excellent engine and transmission (suprisingly quick 4-cylinder - V6 isn't necessary for me) good sized trunk. It is solid and sturdy-built. Feels and demonstrates that it is over- engineered and not chintzed out like some cars.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When car reached around ten thousand miles it developed a problem with the transmission.When you try to maintain speed from forty miles per hour or higher the torque converter feels like it is engaging and disengaging from drive to overdrive continuously.The tach jumps about three or four hundred rpm up and down.You take your foot off the gas pedal for a second and then resume maintaning your speed and the problem goes away for a few miles if your lucky.The service manager at the dealership we bought the car from says this is normal.I don't know how anybody can say that is normal.Don't get me wrong my wife and I like the car except for the transmission issue.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have really hesitated in buying a Chevrolet again. For the past 11 years I have bought imports because of what Chevrolet was making (Cavalier, Beretta, etc.). I have been needing a car to replace my Mazda. I first naturally started with a Mazda 3, which had looked good in the past. This car was gutless and did not really get great mileage. I also tried some of the other imports and was still not impressed. I finally tried the Chevrolet Malibu and I liked how it felt. The fit and finish was nice, the ride was not harsh and not too soft. I really enjoyed the stereo and the steering wheel controls. I am a finally proud to own a Chevrolet again!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the lines of the Malibu and it appears that a lot of thought was given to the interior to make it top of the line. It is also very quiet. I also like the mileage which I watch very carefully and I am averaging a little over 30 mpg. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 4th Malibu. By far this is the best. First, the V6 offers up power and speed like no other (watch it). Its cockpit feel wraps you into the car. The dashboard layout and lighting is very cool. Very quiet and smooth ride. Everything is at your finger tips. The look is very impressive. I tried the Camry earlier in the year and it did not come close, especially the ride. The in and out of the seats is a bit hard, but once you're in, get ready for the ride. This is the best Malibu yet, a lot of rights, a little tweaking maybe needed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It's been a year since I got my Malibu. Overall a good car but sluggish on highways, very uninspiring, gets the job done without fanfare. Chassis is very long making it a pain to park in tight areas. Blind spot on passengers side, love the XM radio, hate the OnStar stuff that comes with the vehicle. Never use it or need! Very quiet on road, fan loud, AC/defrost/heater great. Difficult to back up, can't see how close you are to objects behind. For the money a good buy for a family of 4. It's not my kind of car but at the time it was the only thing I could get and I did not make a bad choice, all and all. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We just traded the van in for an 08 LTZ, Spring Package Malibu. For its class, this is one nice ride. The mating of the Spring Package 4 cylinder to the 6 speed tranny gives the light car plenty of pep and almost as much MPG as one of those compact jobies. If you have to have 0 to 60 in under 5 seconds, then go pay for it in a class that costs a lot more. Beating the guy beside you away from the toll plaza is fun, but over rated. We could have purchased a vehicle in the class above the Malibu, but for what my family finds appealing, it wasn't worth the 20k plus difference. In this class, this car has the nicest exterior lines, smooth acceleration, and very appealing interior luster. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Down right pleasant to look at. Very comfortable and fun to drive. Great gas mileage, Love the interior on the LTZ, nice material and lay out.

The ride is quiet and the road manners are excellent. The interior is beautiful. I have the black interior with the faux wood trim and it's everything and more.

<TEXT>Have owned the Malibu for 10 months and 12,000 miles and have loved almost every minute. Very comfortable ride, very good mileage, excellent interior and awesome deluxe sound system. Truly the best car that I have ever purchased. Only concern is the electric power steering, which started jerking and acting eratic at about 10,000 miles while on an extended 2,500 mile trip. It took 2 trips to dealer to get steering problem corrected. Hopefully this is an isolated problem and not a reoccuring problem similar to earlier Malibu's with electric steering problems. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Premium audio sound system is fantastic. Mileage is about as advertised at 30-31 highway and combined 24. Computer readout on cars condition & performance is great.

<TEXT>We'd been thinking of getting a family-friendly sedan, and when our tiny convertible was totalled in an accident, we settled on the base 4-cyl 2008 Malibu. The pick-up in the Malibu is not that great (but keep in mind, we got the 4-cyl!), but the fuel economy more than makes up for it. We've been averaging over 30 mpg, combined highway and city (about 50/50), and we easily get 35 mpg on the highway. The car is fairly comfortable. It's not the sexiest car in the world, but for the money, it's a bargain. I would definitely buy another.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Malibu less than 1 month ago (I have the 2LT w/ the 6cyl 6spd). I am disappointed only in 2 things. I previously owned an 02 MonteCarlo SS and loved it. My Malibu has a lot of the same luxury features. The 1st thing is the fuel economy, much less than advertised & less than my SS(though still early - only gone thru 2.5 tanks/gas) and I'm still learning how it drives compared to my Monte. The 2nd annoying thing is the cruise control. Monte had such smooth cruise control, going up and down hills, Malibu is a little obnoxious when the cruise is engaged (revvs up loudly when adjusting speeds uphill- again, it's early.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The styling of the car is impressive as it has the lines of a much more expensive car. The ride has been disappointing. Very bumpy and not driver friendly at highway speeds. I was willing to overlook the firm ride if highway stability was solid but that's just not the case. The transmission has a tendency to shift up at low RPM (1K-2K) leaving normal acceleration feeling tired. Although, the 6cyl is very responsive if you step on it or use the paddle shifter instead. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my 2008 Malibu, it is a 2LT with 2.4L and 4-spd auto. It is a great car, best ride and handling of a midsize car I have been in. Bought with GM's employee pricing for everyone deal, and saved about $2500 of sticker price. The interior and exterior design of this car are very classy, and look more expensive then it really was.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM, OnStar, the 17-in wheels are very cool, the 4-cylinder has good pick for being in such a big car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have a bad back. I tried out 19 cars before I found the Malibu LTZ and comfort for my poor sacroiliac. The car is wonderful! Not only does it feel good, it performs beautifully. So far the mileage is good - about 20 around town, 26 on the highway. I expect it to get better. The car is gorgeous on the outside. The color choice for the inside is strange. I would have preferred a gray or white interior, but the black with brick (which was all that was available with the color I chose - golden pewter) is okay. Only negative is that there is no place to put a trash bucket. Otherwise the car is a dream and I love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new Chevy Malibu. I cannot believe how well built it is. I've always been a Chevy driver and have never been disappointed but, man, Chevy outdid themselves with this vehicle. I wouldn't even think about buying an Accord or Camry. The Malibu LTZ feels and looks like it costs at least $10- $20,000 above what I paid for it. Well done Chevy! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my Ford F150 for this car. It hurt but the mileage on the truck was bad compared to how I used it. I used it as a car and hauled very little. I get 19 /21 in town w/the Malibu, that includes the 1000' of altitude I gain or loose on the 4 mile trip to town. The Malibu is the first car I have owned in many years. I have had no problems so far. Miss my truck but at this point would not want to get rid of the Malibu. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the fit and finish both inside and out. The dash & driver controls all seem to make sense and are easy to use. Radio w/IPod jack are good. XM is nice but $13.00 a month, I don't think so. OnStar is nice to have.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This Malibu is without a doubt a pleasure to own and drive. My wife and I currently own a 2005 BMW 3 series and 2005 Lexus IS and purchased the Malibu as a third car after test driving a Honda and Toyota, which did not measure up to the Malibu's looks, design, and quality. We receive more stares and compliments on the Malibu than from our other cars. Did I say better fuel economy too! This Malibu has now become our "first car".</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking to get a safe car (we have a 1 year old) to replace my 95 Jeep. I am 6'3", so the telescopic steering column and moveable foot pedals are a huge plus (I even needed to move the seat forward a bit). The V- 4 is quite powerful, and very quiet. The included features on the 2LT for the price gave me reverse sticker shock. I only went for the optional sunroof and premium floor mats.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my 2008 Malibu LTZ in June of this year. I just hit 1500 miles on it. It has been an awesome car so far. I got it in black granite with the coco cashmere interior. This car looks so sleek. I test drove the Accord V6 and Camry XLE and SE. I had no intension of buying a Chevy but with my last car being a Camaro and it having been reliable for the 9 years I had it I figured I would give a Chevy a test drive at the least. The car certainly kills its competitors as far as appearance. It handled better than the accord and camry and the Malibu LTZ was over 4 grand cheaper than a similarly equipped Camry or Accord. Driving down the road I don't feel like Camry #9999 </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the way the car handles, and the power is great too. It handles like a sports car but has the look of a sleek, expensive European Audi or BMW. I love the two-tone interior as well. This car is unbelievable for the money. Trunk size is good, and rear comfort is roomy as well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great car. I love the 2- tone cocoa/cashmire interior and the ambient lighting. The car handles the curvey New England roads extremely well and I averaged 36 MPG on my first long road trip! XM radio is great, although I probably won't renew the subscription after the free trial. I love the clean lines on the exterior and the dual-cockpit design on the interior. The interior is extremely quiet and the build quality is on par with anything else in it's class. The trunk is large enough to hold my golf clubs and ice hockey bag and still have some room to squeeze stuff in. If you are looking for a great car in this segment you should definitely check out the Malibu.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Excellent car for the money. Chose it over the Accord and Camry due to styling and performance. It is a very quiet car with the insulation and laminated glass that GM incorporates into these cars. Test ride one and you will be surprised on far GM has come in terms of quality and style.

<TEXT>I bought this car to get out from under a Chevy truck. It was the best deal I could get at the time. I not a big fan of American cars, but the Malibu has surprised me. I get very good gas mpg, around 25 city and 33hy. Very quiet for a car under 21K. It has all the things you see in Toyoya, Honda, Nissan, etc. It's a mid size car but gets Honda cCvic gas mpg and is very quiet unlike the Honda. Toys are a different matter. I think they are a little better but this is subjective. I ride in both models (Malibu/Camry). Car fan is loud when set on 3 or higher. AC is OK, not great but gets the job done. I've had better. It takes a litte time to get use to but overall a good value for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the new 2008 Malibu off the showroom and was pleased with all the extras. Heated seats, elect driver's seat, OnStar for the year. It works. A cell phone built in. I've never had so many options that I really like. Very comfortable ride. Something bad, the whole steering column and its motor had to be replaced. Very odd. Doesn't give me a good feeling. </TEXT>

<TEXT>In response to gas prices I traded my beloved F150 for a 2008 Malibu 1LT. I had been looking for a few months & was contemplating an Equinox. In the end it came down to better mileage for the Malibu. After living with the car for a month I have two complaints. I'm 6'1". weigh 230 and am 74 years old. In and out of the drivers seat is a bit of a grunt. Also while the trunk is large the lid is really small. Other than that it is a very good machine. Seats & drivers position are good. The interior seems well laid out. Everything works as it should (only 1000 miles). I do like the fold down rear seats. Makes packing for a vacation (we don't leave much home) easy. It is very quiet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For 22 grand, they have really provided a dynamite vehicle. I hope this did not come too late for GM. Would be a total shame for this car to be brought down by the overall company and economy. Honestly this vehicle rides every bit as good as a BMW with double the sticker shock. I would be extremely nervous in Germany over the quality and fair price of this car. We do not miss our Mercedes SUV not one bit. Dear Lord why did it take GM so long to build a car this solid?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Three weeks ago I bought a black 2LT with 3.6l V6 option. I drive 2 hours each way to/from work. I've already got 3,000 miles on it. I paid right about $23k, even with the bigger engine thanks to a $3,000 off coupon I got in the mail. I get 26mpg combined. If I ride it gently on the weekends I could get better, but that's usually when I have my fun. Instantaneous mpg is at 30mpg if I set cruise control on the highway! The ride is smooth and quiet, better than my dad's luxury import. For a mid-size sedan it gets an awful lot of looks and compliments. It doesn't quite satisfy my appetite for speed/style, but I'm not willing to pay for gas on a Mustang's V8. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The V6. The tap-shift controls on the wheel, effectively making this automatic a simple manual. Satellite radio. The sleek wood finish on the interior. Leather wrapped shifter. iPod jack. The blue lights illuminating the door handles so you can find them in the dark. The interior is insane.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a very nice car, if GM had been building them like this all along, they wouldn't be in the mess they are in now. A comfortable ride, excellent fuel economy, my last trip at 61 mph I averaged 34 mpg and the 4cyl does quite well even with a full load of folks. Prior to my retirement I was averaging 26mpg in crappy Washington, DC commuter traffic, excellent! The interior is very classy and the outside is a head turner. This is the first vehicle I ever owned where people have stopped me and asked about the car. There was one slight flaw in the paint finish between two seams, we'll see if it causes a problem down the road.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking to buy a G35/G37, but received an additional $1500 incentive from GM. With the $2600 GM card rebate, I ended up buying the Malibu for around $23,000. The Infinity was a little better, but cost $15,000 more. The Malibu has a great interior, ride, performance, handling, build quality, and the reliablity should be good. Check out the Motortrend Car of the Year Award (Jan '08). It's almost as good as the $43,000 CTS and I think it should have won the COTY award. I recomend buying the LTZ model for a few thousand more. You get the 3.6 DOHC motor with the 6 speed auto and the nicer interior, wheels and other comforts. I am happy with the gas mileage of 21mpg mixed city and highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had this car about a month, but I love it. Along with the Malibu, I test drove the Ford Fusion, Altima and Impala. The Malibu won me over by far. It rides and drives smoothly and quietly, much like a more expensive car. I purchased the LTZ model and it was well worth the extra price for the extras that you get. The two-toned leather interior is great, also I have the Dark Red exterior color. This color really sets off the chrome trim that the car has. Everywhere I go, people compliment my car. It also gets pretty good gas mileage. The first weekend that I had it we took a short road trip. It got about 28 mpg. Should get around 30 once it gets broken in good. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Malibu reminded me of the driving experience that I got out of my 97 Mitsubishi Diamante a car that was great bang for buck but over shadowed by the big names Lexus & Acura. However I don't believe this will happen with Malibu due to all the advertisement. The car gets lots of looks and people think it's a more expensive vehicle. Love the control you have of the car. I love power so it's not quite enough but for a person who isn't a car buff like myself it's more than plenty. I would buy another one. Tried to get my spouse to get one but they didn't want to have the same car. Car gets stated mpg, engine is quiet & took me awhile to get use to the smooth ride smoother than Accord.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Paddleshifts are great for people who are nervous or inexperienced with traditional manual transmission. Two toned cockpit sold me upon first look at car. Saw at autoshow & had to have it.

Definitely not the old styling of past vehicles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got this car about 3 weeks ago, and I absolutly love it. It's very quiet, has all the features I need and then some, and it's just a very fun car to drive. I do have a few small complaints about it though, such as the blind spots, the low beams, and you cant burn a tire! (although I don't think thats necessarily a bad thing) The car itself is beautiful and I am absolutly in love with the interior, especially the "ambient blue lighting" The gas mileage does leave me wanting more, but I am biased, my last car was a 99 Sunfire which got great mileage, but wasn't nearly as much car as this one is, so I guess it's an even trade. People have even come up to me and compliemented me on it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After extensive research, I traded my 330ix for this behemoth. With less than 5000 miles on it, the transmission is sluggish, making me feel quite insecure and no longer able to drive so defensivly. I've been remanded to the right lane for ever. Forget the passing lanes. Acceleration on this monster is non existent unless you are accelerating 1mph per minute! I've been to the dealer and complained and all he does is check diagnostics, says the car is fine and I'm done. I shoulda got the Honda. Or the Toyota. Or the Mini Cooper. This car can't get out of its own way and I'm stuck for 36 more months. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, my Malibu LS is a great car. I just drove it from New England to New Orleans with no problems reported. The Malibu gets great highway mileage (30 mpg at 75 mph) but is dismal in the city. In normal city traffic with stop and go congestion, I am averaging only 18 mpg, a downright terrible number for a new midsize sedan. If you are planning on buying a Malibu LS mainly for the city, I recommend you test drive one first to see the mileage. Pickup on the highway is poor (especially when the vehicle is packed) but OK for normal driving. Just don't try to pass trucks on the interstate. Besides the city mileage and pickup, my only other complaint is the poor radio reception.</TEXT>
