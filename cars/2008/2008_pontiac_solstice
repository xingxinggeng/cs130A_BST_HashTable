<TEXT>I love this car! 1 sexy machine with a huge "hey BABY" factor. I'm 50 and it makes me feel 16 again! Has every option available, wicked fast even with the auto tranny and I've shown a lot of STUNNED 'Stangs and BMWs tire smoke and tail lights (got the performance upgrade so it's hotter than the reg one) and I had to buy a radar detector because I'm a very bad girl!! Loved my Town Car but after driving TCs for a decade I wanted something HOT-smooth sexy curves and the adorable eager-to-run expression on it's little buck-toothed face makes me smile every time I see it. A real head-turner that folks swear must be an import and blazing speed to keep this old gal happy! I love him SO MUCH!!!!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Monsoon Stereo, leather seats, power windows and cruise control to keep the cops from snagging me for not paying attention--it will run all day at 90 as smooth as at 65! Its a great tanning bed substitute</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is very well received at any local show and shines, and parades, that I have entered it in. I have never found that lowering the top is a problem. And, I routinely complete the task, in 15 seconds. Raising it is only slightly more time consuming, requiring 28-30 seconds. The power window switches could have been better placed. I would have preferred wind up windows, and side pockets. The cup holders, I really could care less. A bigger trunk, would be a great help for weekend touring. But with some creative packing, two can go on a weekend cruise. I also, do not require A/C in a roadster, and would have appreciated the weight savings, and possible extra horse power. Stereo 1st class!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, body style, handling, traction is great. This car has the factory sport suspension, and limited slip differential. It is turbo charged, and gets 32-36 mpg. I like the feel and support of the seats. The sport pedals. The dealership gave me an exceptional deal.Car well treated, full of gas.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After selling a Honda S2000 over year ago I decided to jump back into the vert world. The Solstice really wasn't in the running until I got the $3000 dollar coupon from my GMCard. I paid just over 16.5k for a brand new '08 with the wheel package, Monsoon radio (a must), and a few other goodies. The car stickered at $26,062. An unbelievable deal and I'm pleasantly surprised with the ride, handling and even the performance of the 2.4 ltr. The fit and finish is great and the materials aren't as cheap as I had expected from a GM product. This may just be the best car deal I've ever made.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Monsoon radio--very nice Short throw shifter is less sluggish than I had expected Appearance with top down is awesome</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Magazine reviewers have lost the perspective of being an actual owner of the car. This car makes me feel 25 years younger and, for the first time, strangers actually look at what I'm driving. Even had a couple take a picture of it! It handles like better than any car I've EVER driven, accelerates on a touch, and stops evenly and when I want it to. For a big guy like me, it's comfortable and reasonably roomy (for a roadster, that is).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall responsiveness, standard features, available options. The car is extremely well built, well-fitting parts, no creaks or groans at the joints or seams. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I each have one, and they are toys for weekend use. Yes, the guy who placed the switches should be shot, but, in spite of al the complaints from magazine types, we can, with thought, place enough luggage for 2 for a 1 week trip. Just no big bags. There are plenty of storage slots if you look at it, even with the top down. Mileage is way better than EPA says. We get 25 mpg in town on both cars. The top can be a pain, but once you get a system, it's pretty easy. It is a fun car, and handling is great. Took mine to Phx In'tl Raceway's roadcourse and had a blast. yes, the interior design team must have had a party the night before, but the fun factor outweighs the negatives.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With cat-like agility and blistering acceleration, I just love my solstice gxp. While driving from San Diego to Las Vegas and staying fairly close to the speed limit (which is difficult) I actually got 33.1 mpg. As far as the manual top, I can pop it down faster than most automatic tops. As far a putting it back up, it takes a little more time, but still, its not that hard and I don't mind. Yes it does have animalistic head turning looks, and yes it gets a lot of attention from the ladies who want to ride with me. Guys if you want a babe-magnet car, with blistering acceleration, and hurricane force winds with top down, this is the beast (i mean car) to have.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Body style and acceleration. For anyone not use to moving fast, this car can be a scary fast in the begining, but once you get comfortable, you feel as if your into a feral cat ready to pounce on all the mice (other cars)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have always been a lover of the Old Vets but have never been able to buy one. The solstice gives me the ability to afford a fun car to drive with out costing me a fortune. I love driving this car and enjoy the looks the people give me when I drive by. There is nothing practicle about this car but that is the reason I bought it. It looks great and is a lot of fun to drive!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling and looks. The 4 cylinder engine does a great job pushing this car down the road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My father told me to buy an S2000 and my brother said Miata, so I bought my Solstice. I have never enjoyed driving anything as much as I enjoy taking the top down and cruising in this. It is beautiful, sporty, roomy enough for what I wanted, and most deservingly a head-turner. As for the car critics 'not enough room, interior needs better styling, needs more power and handling,' don't get me started. If it were up to the major critical magazines and publications we would all be driving BMW's and Mercedes anyway. For less than 22K out the door, with rebates and employee pricing, I am fully satisfied and laughing at the Z4's and Kompressors. I think I'm gonna buy my wife the coupe. The top needs no improvement. I timed myself with no help other than my buddy pushing start on the stop watch. 10 seconds to lower the top, 8 to put it back up. Tell me your automatic put-the-car-in-park tops can do that.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a blast to drive. Everyone stares at you like you are driving a spaceship. Never get tired of driving this car. Stereo is awesome. Speaker behind passenger seat will rock you for sure. I'm 57 and feel 16 when I get behind the wheel. The car is my wife's so I only get to drive on weekends. Should by another for me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've got 3,800 miles on our '08 GXP. It has gone through deserts, an Idaho sand storm, crossed mountains in flash- flood conditions and has shined in every situation. Two rebuttals on criticism: 1.) Some critics say the manual tranny is rough and hard to shift. When broken in at about 3K, it becomes butter-smooth. 2.) No storage space. Bull. You just need to know how to pack. I just took our GXP on a road trip to support a SWAT team's training operation. In the GXP, I had a large camera bag, tripod, large duffel with a week's change of clothes, gun bag, laptop bag, and ten blank-firing pistols, rifles and a shotgun. Plenty of room for all! Treat yourself: buy a GXP!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling. Power. Styling. Soft top is icing on the cake, and despite some negative comments, it is easy to put up and take down.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've been in love with this car months before the first '06 ever hit the road. It was the day before I was to pick up a pre-owned 2008 G6 GT I had just purchased when I was told I just received a pretty substantial pay raise. That was it, it was finally my time!! 4 days later I was driving home my Brazen colored Solstice. I love this car. This car is sexy as hell and IMO blows the Sky away in the looks department. It's a blast to drive and never fails to turn heads. My only regret is I purchased it with only a couple of months of driving days left before it gets put up for the winter. That's ok - between employee pricing and end of season blowout they knocked $5k off the MSRP - what a steal!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks of this little roadster is as one reviewer put it "mesmerizing". It handles great and there's no other feeling like it in the world when you are cruising on a warm summer night with the top down. She's pretty much loaded with the exception of ABS and auto trans - I love all of her features</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In 4 weeks I now have 2800 miles. Car is too fun. Did a weekend trip to Laughlin, NV and averaged 31.8 mpg. Noticed many people speed up to see my car, almost as if they are trying to figure out what kind of car it is. Definitely this is a chick magnet. I love all the attention the women give me just for a ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a fun car to drive! I don't understand how the "expert" reviewers can rate the Sky higher than the Solstice. They are virtually the same car. This is a roadster & therefore should not be considered a roomy car. It would be great if the top were powered instead of manual but it's not difficult to put up & down. I would stop the car to put up & down anyway. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power is really fun. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 260 HP Solstice is the most addictive driving experience I've ever had. This car is like mainlining heroin to an auto enthusiast. Quick and agile, but packing plenty of power and kick, the Solstice GXP offers a visceral thrill unseen since the era of the mid-Sixties Corvette roadster. With XM radio, On-Star and enough room in the trunk for an overnight bag, the Solstice is the quintessential date car. I'm courting my wife all over again, and we're having a blast rolling around the back county roads with the top down and a picnic lunch in the trunk. You can't miss with this Pontiac. Test drive it at your peril. You'll find yourself taking one home with no regrets.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, performance, styling. We own a GTO and a G8 GT. The G8's a sophisticated lady, refined, lithe quick on her feet and very astute. The GTO is like a great red wine with a Wild Turkey chaser. This GXP is a twentysomething model with serious attitude. You'll fall stupid-in-love with her.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got the 08 after seeing it on the road.Did my research first. Back cup holder OK with me. The driver side holder needs improvement. Plastic looks fragile. Airbag light too obvious on dash. Auto trans. works for me, shifts great. Chrome grille would class it up. Would like a removable luggage rack for the back. Could have included door pockets but would sacrifice width. Perhaps a netting to hold odd and ends. Mirrors a little too small. Good sound system with 6 deck CD. My mistake was getting it for my wife. I don't like to beg. Put the SUV away until winter. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow, Pontiac has excited me with this car! Its fun to drive and turns heads, all my lady friends want to drive it. As well as it handles and is magnetized to the road its hard to let anyone but me drive it. I purchased the car knowing there wasn't much storage space in it. Didn't buy it for storage anyway, as far as the cup holders, wouldn't care if they were there or not. Glad theres not an ashtray, gives me a reason not to let friends smoke in my car! </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>New Roadster Owner</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>The GPX is amazing! This is the first roadster that I have owned and I am very happy with my choice. The Solstice is the only car that I have been able to drive comfortably. I am a large person (6 ft 325 lbs) with a very long torso. Other cars I have looked at did not have the hip room and head room that I needed. The Solstice has both. One other car I looked at had so little room, I looked OVER the windshield when seated in the car and I could not close the door because it hit my leg. Other than being very comfortable in the Solstice, it is really fun to drive. Other reviews complain about the meager trunk space, all I can to say is this car was only meant for hauling - well you know!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I opted for the GPX model because it had better fuel economy and more power. I have not been disappointed with my decision. My Solstice is averaging over 30 MPG which is better than the 28 MPG rating. It is great to come across a car that over delivers rather than under delivers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife gave it to me for my 55th Birthday. I have owned 5 - 240, 260 and 280 Z-cars. When you reach my age you either get a Harley a Sports Car or an exercise bike. I chose the Solstice... Nothing can touch it ... it's fast, feels like a million dollars and really gets the looks. Could not be more pleased! My other choice was $20K extra on a BMW. This beats the BMW hands down!</TEXT>

<TEXT>i have hardly any regrets in buying this little jewel. there are some little quirks that i will address just because they are aggravating. the engineer that thought to put the radio power knob in the center of the radio where your hand hits it every time u shift into third gear must surely be proud. same goes for the mute/power button radio controls on the steering wheel. their placement turns the radio or sound completely off when hit.side mirrors r way too small. but...this is a head turning car that turns heads...they r just trying to figure out what the colored streak is that just went zooming by....lol</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall a very well performing car that handles darn near as good as a C6 Corvette, maybe better in some respects. Fun, and the exterior styling cannot be beat. Mechanically a very sound design. Interior needs work as far as convenience, but if you rate it from a driving perspective only, the interior is functional. As soon as you start adding niceties like where to put your spare change, sunglasses, or cell phone... the interior's shortcomings come to light quickly as does the non existent trunk space. The exterior design and performance of this vehicle is what sells.</TEXT>

It will, although be in a slab heated work shop with me. I'll visit the wife on weekends if time permits. Thanks again Pontiac.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car! The handling is great, no front end wandering, takes corners like they are not there. The fit and finish are teriffic, I worked in the auto industry for 30+ years and know about fit and finish. Have always driven GM and had two bad cars when GM had the quality issues, but those are gone and the product is now excellant. The styling looks good - we have had comments of "Cool car, Good wheels, Love your car" from teens and adults. You can ride with the top down at highway speed and carry on a conversation, and we do not have the opt. wind screen. With the top up wind noise is non-existent, just the soft rumble of the exhaust. A pleasure to drive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>An exceptional vehicle. Beautiful design(best GM has put together in a while)and always gets the looks. Simple with clean lines. Has that classic roadster feel. The car has plenty of pick up and power, always wants to go. (oh that turbo) So easy to spin those tires. Has pretty solid handling. Storage could be an issue for some. Interior is like a cockpit. Clean in design. Cup holder placing is in an odd spot(I dont use the 2 on the back wall. Stereo has great sound, love the mp3 adapter. Seats on the GXP are great, road trips have been really comfortable(Pack light). </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a red 2008 GXP last weekend. This car has a lot of potential with a few changes. Interior materials are ok but not up to the same standards as the MX-5. Trunk space with the top down is non-existent. The manual gearbox should be improved to minimize the effort required to move between gears. The best way to describe it is clunky. Despite these drawbacks, the car is a lot of fun to drive, gets a lot of attention from admirers and is fast.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My previous car was BMW Z4 3.0. So far, I really like the GXP's performance. The exterior is hot! My only beef with the exterior is the black grill -- it looks cheap! Why not keep the same chrome grill as the Solstice? The interior is sleek -- the seats hug you. However, there is no storage space. I can't even find any place to keep my garage door opener. I've noticed that the window controls are in an awkward place -- inevitably, my elbow triggers the windows. The biggest pain is the manual top -- miss the Z4's automatic top. There is no trunk space with the top down. Wish they offered navigation system as option. But can't beat the price and bravo to Pontiac for its cool design!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior is hot! Love the unique design - wish BMW and Mercedes would design similar car. My black GXP turns heads! Great stereo system. MP3 hook-up is part of the package. Love the XM radio option. This sucker is fast!Comparing it to my Z4 3.0 (in sport mode), this car has faster pick-up</FAVORITE>
