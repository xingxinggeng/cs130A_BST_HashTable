<TEXT>Got the 08 CX new as a Company Car Good: Very supportive seats. A lot of standard features for base model. Bad: Fuel mileage is horrible. I'm lucky to get 24 highway and avg 16 city. My Honda Odyssey gets better mileage and it is taller, heavier, and has more hp. Driver seat started squeaking at 20k miles-I only weigh 185lbs. Brakes went at 20k miles- almost all highway. I've never had brakes go anywhere near that quickly. Steering wheel made a clicking sound- several dealers couldn't find the problem. Left windshield wiper splashes water on right side and right wiper missed it. key fob died-even after repl. btry. A lot of minor annoying problems that were expensive and inconvenient to fix</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the leather wrapped steering wheel; standard options on base model- Onstar, satellite radio, dual automatic climate control</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I read the reviews about the vibration. We took ours to a tire shop and they told us the vibration was due to the rear struts being out of line. We took it to the dealer and they put in some shims to align the rear. They also said it was due to a factory defect. However they didn't want to accept responsibility for the ruined tires. Hope this helps anyone else with vibration problems.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought CXL last Jan. so after a year and about 6,000 miles, it is still a good car. Bought a new CXS in 2005 and liked it so much, bought another one this past year. On the strength side, I like the exterior and interior (dash) looks and its nice ride for these old bones. On the negative side, the gas mileage is putrid at about 17 in town and 25 on the highway. Liked the Lucerne but felt it was too big. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rides and looks great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted to get the CXL because of some features it had, but did not want leather seats. So we had to get the CX in order to get cloth seats. Our 97 Century Limited had cloth seats (Buick let me down on this one). Mileage is dissappointing, 28 highway / 19 city. Our old Century got 30+ highway. But this LaCrosse is a very enjoyable and fun car to drive. It is comfortable, pleasant to look at, and despite my dissappointment with the leather seat issue, a really nice car. Guess we'll keep it til Buick comes up with one that will get 35 - 40 mpg! With the sleeker styling, I do keep brushing my head against the top of the door each time I get in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the car, except it uses oil. First 3000 miles, used two extra quarts, dealer says drive it and it will get better. Second 3500 miles, used one and a half extra quarts of oil. I quess this is better, but I don't think good. Dealer says keep watching it and one quart in 3000 miles is acceptable. Maybe to him but not to me. I ask that it be recorded on my record. Hope they did it. If it doesn't improve, I going to try going to Buick.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased this 08 LaCrosse in April, 2008, have 20,000 on it already and love it! Got the base model, but it's a Buick! So it has all the creature comforts--power windows, door locks, and driver seat; cruise, tilt--and great gas mileage. Good git-up-and-go and plenty of room inside. Nice sized steering wheel for a womans hands. Only knock is the trunk is a little narrow to get a large suitcase into and out of easily, but I love the trunk release design! Overall, a great vehicle for the money. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The trunk release with the interior lock button. Like the redesigned waterfall front with chrome wheels-- sharp looking vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have has a Pontiac for the past 12 years. I absolutely love my LaCrosse. Just a few enhancements that would make it even better! I think the passenger seat should be electric, just as the drivers seat is. Climate control vents in the rear would alson be a great feature as well. I know I make my right buying decision with the Buick. Thanks GM</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a beautiful red Buick LaCrosse Super 2008 a month ago and it's everything I could have wanted. Previously had a 2005 Buick LaCrosse 2005 which I traded in for this. The Super is slightly roomier with more bells and whistles, including ultrasonic rear parking assistance. Both cars perform well in both city and highway. The Super has a bigger engine than the CXL. My husband, who loves German cars, loved the CXL and loves the Super with its 8 cylinders even more. In short, I would buy both LaCrosse CXL and Super all over again. Also get many compliments on how beautiful the car is.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Remote starter which warms the car before I get in it. Heated front seats. Quiet ride. Equipped with OnStar. Ultrasonic rear assistance. Additional radio/CD controls on steering wheel. Sun roof. Car stability and performance. Wonderful brakes. Lumbar support. Beautiful design inside and out.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We live 75 miles from the dealer, bought a 2008 la cross new. After 4 trips back to fix all the scratches, 5 trips back and forth for the vibration & also a set of new tires, we still have the vibration!They are telling me that it is the road surface and not the car, we are disappointed & I will turn it in as a lemon as it is!What a disgrace to the name of Buick, just read another unhappy person's review with the vibration problem in here too, need to take some action, what is going on? why do they blame the roads for a vibration in the car, it will be a Toyota for us, and that is to sad.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am willing to bet that at 31, I am the youngest person to write a review on this car! LoL! My last vehicle was a Volvo S70, so don't think I am someone who blindly loves GM. When I heard Buick was #1 in reliability from JD Powers, I decided to check them out. It had everytihng I wanted; pleanty of options, under 25k, excellent record of reliability, V6 power, comfortable ride, etc. I was acutally looking at Volvo S40s and Audi A3s, but stopped by the Buick dealer on whim. Overall, the Buick had more HP and standard options than the others, but most importantly, it has a much better warranty! I liked the fact that Buick stands by their product for 100k miles! I am pleasently surprised!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the comfortable ride and V6 power! The LaCrosse got some much needed re-styling for 2008. I think the new front end looks great! As silly as it may sound, I also like that fact that I can take some pride in the fact I bought an American brand, the oldest American brand in fact.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really enjoy this car, and I am 33. I had owned a 2006 Impala SS and had traded it after only 6 months because I averaged 22MPG. I then had a 2006 Grand Prix GT which was powerful, but had a stiff, uncomfortable ride. Every interior trim piece rattled. I just got this LaCrosse Super, and it is a major improvement over the Impala SS! Throttle response was tamed to you can ease away from stops. And, I am actually averaging 16MPG in the LaCrosse. Very quiet, great ride, and it handles very well for a Buick. Mine doesn't float and wallow and lean like other reviews have said. I'm very happy with this car, and the Red Jewel Tintcoat is the perfect color for this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this Buick brand new with 1 mile on the odometer. When we test drove it. It had a vibration .The dealer said it was a tire out of balance and would be no problem to fix. We have had this car for 10 weeks now and have only drove it 10 days out of the 10 weeks now. This is the 4th time in the shop. It has been in the shop for the last 5 weeks now. This car has had the front end realined,the front axles changed, 2 sets of tires. If this is GMC best thin I will have to buy a import the next time. And one thing to add, it leaked on the passager side when it rained. We called GMC to complain and asked for a new car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned Buicks for ten years (2000 Lucerne and current 2006 Lucerne CXL). Buicks have beed a preferred car in my family since 1935. The 2008 LaCrosse lives up to Buick's reputation for excellence in interior and exterior design. Handling is responsive (I have the optional ESC); performance is adequate; and interior road noise is minimal even at freeway speeds. Fit and finish is outstanding.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've read the other review and wonder what car they are driving. Thankfully this is a lease car from my company, and I cannot wait to be rid of it. Seating is uncomfortable 6ft 170 lb male. Very poor gas mileage around 20. Buy a Honda Accord or a Ford 500/Taurus. Soft suspension, vague handling. Climate control is a real pain to work with, requires constant attention. Styling - misses the mark as compared to the others out there. Quality - cheap plastic, noise, etc. I rent cars almost every week as I travel, and get to drive SUV's, sedans, etc. The Saturns are better than this. How does GM get away with this trash? Same as a Chevy Impala, at least it looks slight better. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for about a week now and I'm really surprised. The styling is excellent. I like the front end more than i do the rear. I alwasy thought that Buick was styled for the elderly, but they sure proved me wrong with thier new line of cars. The interior could be desinged nicer, but overall it is very comfortable. The power is excellent too! There really isn't any turbo lag, so it's fun to just floor it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought our car, in Flint, Michigan, left for our winter home in Arizona, and what a ride! We had forgotten how wonderful it is to drive and ride in a Buick. We took it in and got it all "gussied, " up and wow is it cute! It is not only pretty it is sharp! Added a sharp spoiler and now it's even more sharp. I get a kick out of tTger's commercial, "a Buick was always a car for my parents age." Well that fits us but this Buick of ours is not 1970! It is a ride that has no competition, and the 2008 we purchased, more than surpasses any other car on the road. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Much will be a comparison of our 2008 Buick LaCrosse vs. our 2001 Century. Buick advertises a smoother, quieter ride. This has proven true. Our car come with the convenience package which gives us heated seats, lumbar support and much electronic instrumentation which is good, but hard to learn & understand. The LaCrosse I believe has a little less headroom over the door when getting in and out which has made it a little more difficult for my slightly stiff 80 year old 5'10" frame. The Century had directional lights which lit up the road in the direction you were turning, which we miss. The LaCrosse does not. The gas mileage has gone down considerably. 19.5 MPG vs. 23 mpg. Good car overall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is made for driving. The performance, braking and handling is superb. I have always been a Buick lover and I think Buick has outdone themselves on this one. Besides being very satisfied with it's handling, performance etc. I own a Red jewel Super with Cocoa interior. This is an absolute hot looking car too! My wife and I took it cross country on a route 66 trip all the way from Chicago to L.A. - what a ride! Very satisfied!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature is how this car feels so good to drive - like it holds you in the drivers seat with everything perfectly positioned within reach. There isn't a current model vehicle that matches the beautifully stylish exterior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I both love this car, our second car is also a Buick with the 3800 V6. We now draw straws to see who gets to drive the LaCross. The car has better response than our other Buick and handles much better. The trim and design are second to none. We looked at a Honda and were undecided until we drove both. No question the Buick is a better ride and feel. The mpg is excellent on the highway, 27.5mpg, not as good in town though. Worth a look and even more worth a test drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car really purrs. Quiet inside with a strong exhaust note. Accelerate to 65 and slam the brakes. Great stopping time, no pulling left/right. gGas mileage? Who cares. Finally an American car that really looks like something people will buy. Watch the reaction from Acura TL and Altima owners. That says it all.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have about 2000 miles on it thus far. Our first Buick after years of only Japanese car purchases. We haven't been disappointed. The 2008 LaCrosse's redesigned front end reduces (or even eliminates) the "grandparents' car" look with a sleeker more attractive style. The comfort and convenience package is worth the price, which adds fold-down rear seats, heated front seats, and a few other amenities. Very nice. City mileage has averaged in the high teens or 20 mpg, and highway mileage in the 28-30 mpg range. The car rides smoother and quieter than any Camry/Altima we test drove, has great acceleration, and comes with many standard features you pay more for in the Japanese cars. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth and quiet ride, heated front seats, updated styling, decent gas mileage for a larger V6 car, more than adequate sound system, OnStar and XM radio.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At 1400 Miles so far I can honestly say I love my New Lacrosse. The LaCrosse CXL is very much a luxury car. Soft comfortable interior, very quiet on the road, lots of features, and a fantastic ride. Buick has firmed up the suspension from the LeSabres and it is a wonderful balance between good control and a smooth ride. No more floaty Buicks. I have had passengers comment that it rides as well as their much more expensive Audi. The 3.8L V6 provides ample pickup but is still quiet, and it should last a long time by reputation. It is a very enjoyable car to drive and well worth checking out. This car is not typical Buick of the past.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the car's handling and the ride. It's sharp and when I step on the gas pedal it is powerful. A car you can get into trouble with on the highway very easily. Great for long trip! However, as others have said, it doesn't live up to the posted MPG. I get 5 miles less in the city and 2 miles less on Hwy. A real gas hog.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My low oil level light came on and when I checked the oil it was only about a 1/4" showing on the stick. Called the dealer and took it in and they said the 2008 seals were changed and that I needed to have them taken out and replaced because of the oil level dropping. So hopefully changing these seals will solve my problems and I can depend on it for years to come. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my first Buick in December 2007. I chose a LaCrosse CXS. After owning a Olds Intrigue, I wanted to see what Buick had to offer. What a surprise. I loved my Lacrosse with the V-6. It had power, luxury and was so much better built than my Olds. I heard that Buick was going to build the Super, so I waited and bought the one off the showroom floor. I gave my CXS to my son,he loves it and he is 21. What a wonderful car!. Buick and GM have finally put together a complete package of power,luxury,value and overall satisfaction you will not regret. I find my Super to be smooth comfortable and fun to drive. I like it better than my Caddy STS.This is no old man car, I drive 140 miles a day.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet, very smooth ride that is not mushy. Buy the V-8. Great power and sound. Bose system is outstanding. The seats are very well designed and comfortable. The auto start feature a must! Interior is a home run!</FAVORITE>
