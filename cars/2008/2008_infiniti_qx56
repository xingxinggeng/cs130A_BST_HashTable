<TEXT>The truck is great, I purchased it to replace my 07 EXT due to a baby on the way. I needed something with better crash ratings. The funny thing is that two days after purchasing the truck, a 75FT tree fell across the highway and I had to go through it at 75MPH. If I were to have the GM, I would most likely not be typing this. This truck saved my wife's and my life. I added a remote starter on the truck. A bit pricey, but extremely useful. Also added an I-Pod attachment that plays video and made it so that I can control the GPS and watch video while driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hands down, the crash rating. Next up would be the size. There is a lot of room is this truck.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The QX-56 is the best SUV secret out there. Stunning fit and finish inside, and excellent engine -- torque and power (mileage is poor though). We get 13 mpg in city driving and 16 mpg highway. If you drive 55, you'd be able to coax 17.5 or 18 mpg highway. Beautiful leather and wood accents. Electronics are abundant and XM Radio is terrific. Not a "beautiful" car on the outside, but still the best I've owned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine torque, tight turning radius, wonderful suspension, roominess, electronics, leather & wood, fit and finish, flexibility/features. Infiniti dealer service.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had a series of high-end super SUVs, including Landcruisers, Land Rovers, Lexus LX470, and I tested all of their most recent models before buying the QX56. This Infiniti is the best by far. It is huge on the inside, FAR larger than a Landcruiser/LX570 or Range Rover. Far more luxurious and full-featured than any other large SUV other than the Range Rover. Everything is well thought out. The exterior is handsome, especially the gigantic chrome grill and chrome roof racks. These trucks are rare enough to continually look fresh, unlike say an X5. At 5000 mile it is still solid, rattle-free, and a joy to drive. I don't think there is a better large SUV out there at any price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Prestigious-looking front grill. Gorgeous wood dash/door accents. Separate folding/removable middle seat in the middle row (acts like a pass- through for kids, or can fold up for 8-passenger seating). Power fold-flat 3rd row. Logical controls. Quality feel everywhere. Simple Nav screen. Bluetooth.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love it. Has everything, sound system, bluetooth (connects and disconnects when needed, tried other manufacturers' systems, not happy), voice control, best rear view camera that displays image in milliseconds and has lines and noise alarm, anyone can park safely. Also great when rearing with a boat trailer. Engine has so much trust. Cannot drive without intelligent cruise control anymore. Luxurious, comfortable and roomy. It is like flying first class.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Excellent full size SUV for a medium to large family that needs space and the ability to haul or tow weight. We pack a lot when we travel. We have been on icy roads, full snow storms, up to 1 foot of snowed in driveways, mud, dirt, rain... you name, we have done it with a load of 2 adults, 3 medium to large dogs, and one child. This car outperforms Ford Expeditions, GMC Yukon, Chevy Tahoe's, and others in the areas of braking, handling and overall feel. With a full load, of around 800 lbs, we average about 15.2 mpg. Just in town around 14.5 and mostly freeway with no load around 16.5 going about 70 mph. Our 2007 Acura MDX with a full load averaged only 14.5 mpg. We use regular fuel 87.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Headlights, braking is supreme, 125ft for 60mph. Navigation, 4x4 low for deep snow, 4x4 high for icy roads. Sound system is great. Always lots of power. Very stable in turns and suspension, auto leveling ride is great. All in all, great car. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Happy QX56 Owner</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>This is my second QX56, the first being a 2005. I can not say enough on how great this vehicle is. Neither of my trucks has ever had a issue. The dealership provides free oil changes ever 3,500 and is a pleasure to deal with. The QX56 has just about everything a large, luxury SUV should have. So quiet, so powerful, yet nimble given its size.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Love this car</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I purchased this 2008 Infiniti over the summer and have had a few months to drive it. I love it. We looked at EVERY SUV in this category and for the comfort, technology and price nothing can compete with it. I feel like I am in a living room with every option available to me. The third row is a dream to use and to sit in. The 1st/2nd row has a ton of room. I love that the navigation can be used while driving because it is a voice navigation. The voice also understands me! It is really an amazing vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>heated steering wheel, music box, keyless go, voice navigation, heated seats, third row automatic, console in 2nd row is removable, cup holders for seven, xm radio whole term of lease, automatic trunk... love it</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Extremely Happy!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I compared every SUV out there with a third row and this one gives you the most luxuries/technology for your dollar. We also looked at the Mercedes GL, Escalade ESV, Lexus LX 570 and the Navigator. This car has the whole package! If you want a vehicle with a third row that you use a lot this car is the best of what is out there. If a third row is not important it still is the best of what is out there.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated steering wheel, keyless go/entry is amazing, music box burns CDs, XM radio for whole term of lease, power third row, power lift gate, rearview monitor, voice activation for phone and navigation which is a huge plus b/c you can use while driving!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove all the SUV in the same categories. After 3 mos. of searching I finally made my decision. Infiniti QX56 is the one. I searched for the roomiest third row seat, roomy 2nd row seat and all the gadget that I experienced in driving all competitors in the same categories I found that QX56 has it all.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation is great its touch screen! Hard drive and flash card for my music collections and so much leg room for 1st, 2nd and 3rd row.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great vehicle for the price. Even not factoring in the price, it is a great vehicle. I compared the QX to the Lexus LX 570. The LX has great bells and whistles, but the trade offs for going into the QX with the great price savings make the choice a no brainer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CD player records 2009 songs. No more CDs! Also, the 3 year subscription to XM, with Xm traffic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We are extremely happy with the QX. After looking at everything out there, (and I do mean everything), we chose the QX for its blend of comfort, performance, quality, features and style. There are other vehicles out there that do some of the individual aspects better, but none that impart the thoughtful implementation that makes this vehicle the whole package. Everything is well thought out and very well executed. After living with it for awhile, you realize that all the "little things" are just right, and everything works together in harmony for a delightful driving experience. Exceptional value for the money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great vehicle if you need / want a large SUV and don't mind the poor gas mileage. My only major disappointment was to discover the only method of getting a song onto the hard drive is to rip it directly from an audio CD. Anyone who has spent the time to move their music collection to a computer understands the amount of time this requires and would find it ludicrous to have to do this again in a car one CD at a time. In addition, the Compact Flash slot will only read up to 500 songs regardless of the size of the CF card (A cheap 4 gigabyte CF card will hold approx 1000 songs). These issues limit the usefulness of the music system, but if that is not important, the car is great</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my QX!! We made deal on 2007 then they got their first 2008 in, one look and I had to have it! changes are incredible and the 2008 QX should be SUV of the year. Beautiful inside, beautiful out...we love all the chrome! Luxury top notch. Love the bluetooth capability, the power 3rd row seats, intellicruise, music box is awesome. I buy all my songs on itunes and then load them in, we love that feature! Leather is beautiful, controls are perfectly placed and the power of this baby is hard to beat. First time I stepped on the gas, it gave new meaning to 'stepping on it'. I feel safe with my children in this SUV and we couldn't be happier to be driving this SUV. It deserves more credit!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Music Box, 20 inch wheels, chrome details, gorgeous leather and wood trim, design, intelicruise, bluetooth, power 3rd row, great sunroom... this car has it all. You just cant beat it!</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Luv QX56</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>We travel a lot with 2 very tall kids. So when searching for a large SUV, rear legroom is a must. Having looked at all the typical choices (GMC, Chevy, Ford, Cadillac, Toyota, Lexus) once we looked at the Infiniti, nothing else came close. The number of options that are standard are amazing (i.e. heated steering wheel, rear heated seats, auto fold side mirrors, power 3rd row seats, power liftgate, etc.). The interior design and legroom of the QX56 are far superior to the others. The space behind the 3rd row seat is somewhat limited, but rarely do we use that seat. Mileage isn't great, averaging about 15 mpg between city/highway driving, but I knew that going into the purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated steering wheel, navigation system, power folding outside mirrors, power liftgate, high quality interior, very comfortable seats throughout.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just traded an 04 for an 08. You can't believe how different the two are. The 08 has been elegantly refreshed with wood, heated steering, Bluetooth, Power rear seats, etc etc. I didn't believe they could improve on the 04, which I thought was a great truck..but they did. The ride is far superior to the 04. The nav, DVD, XM, 20" wheels are all tremendous improvements. We have driven them all... Escalade, Denali, Range Rover, Navigator - nothing holds a candle to this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the 4th SUV we have owned and by far the finest. We loked at every large SUV available up to the $83K Lexus 570. And the value proposition of the QX56 was the best of class. Fit and finish is exceptional. It is a fun vehicle whose style is really coming into its own. Many think it was years ahead of its time when it was first introduced, but with the upgrades and minor front and rear fascia changes for 2008, is now just plain beautiful.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride quality, fit and finish, interior amenities, and style. Longer wheel base than others in this class for a smoother ride. 2nd row legroom unmatched by any other large SUV.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I owned a 2004 (first year model) and had several problems with it. I finally decided to get a new one to take advantage of all the modifications and upgrades. Boy were there a lot of them. From the much more luxurious interior (more wood grain) to folding mirrors with directional signal, heated steering wheel, larger DVD screen, power rear seat, larger wheels.... and the list goes on and on. They did everything right and I am in love with my 2008.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got 3 kids and my wife doesn't want a minivan. The QX56 is a true LUXURY SUV and I think it's the best deal out there for the price. If you are looking for a large luxury SUV for your family, I would suggest the QX56. It has all the bells and whistles included in the price except for nav and Tech Package. Not like other company with extra options can raise the price another 10K.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>20" wheel, plenty of room, keyless start, intelligent cruise control, Bluetooth, HID light, 3 years free XM radio & traffic, music box 10GB, and best of all, it look awesome and luxurious. Best deal for the buck luxury SUV.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am loving my new QX. I got it at the start of the new year. It has been great. I have 4 children and they fit very well. The 3rd row has theater seating so seeing the DVD is no problem. The ride is very smooth. It is as close to a sedan as any full size SUV I have been in. It has power to spare. Passing on 2 lane highways is a breeze. The cabin is very quiet despite the big 20in wheels. It has been great on the snow traction with the variable 4 wheel drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This is a luxury vehicle with all the bells and whistles but it has the room and power to do work and carry a family of 6 comfortably for long distances.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased my '08 QX and am completely in love w/it. I am a definite car enthusiast and there is simply no SUV that provides a better overall package of luxury and amenities in the world. It delivers powerful performance, it's very smooth and quiet on the road, the list of features is astounding, and it looks gorgeous. I test drove an Escalade. There is no comparison. The QX56 is smoother, quieter, has a lot more features, and actually provides better performance and quicker response than the Escalade.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Q and the difference between the two is substantial - previously owned a 2005. Infiniti has introduced to the market the quintessential SUV: style; comfort; luxury ride; quiet; technology; driving pleasure; smooth power; outstanding price point. I tested and researched all SUVs and literally there is no comparison. Those in the market for a SUV, all they have to do is test drive the Q and they will say the same. The Q56 has no rival and should be the SUV of the Year!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had the car for 45 days. Love it. Excellent fit and finish and gadgetry for the price (or any). Finally a big SUV with 20" rims standard (hated large cars with tiny wheels and empty wheel well). Entertainment center is an afterthought and not as well integrated (placed in the center console instead of the front dashboard, screens are not in headrest, plays only one dvd, interface not easily accessible), hence it's an option. Puts the Escalade ESV to shame (loud over priced truck) for 20K less. Handles like a large sedan, not a truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just got our new QX. We really liked what we tested drove and ordered one. We are pleased with the car overall. If you want a BIG SUV, this is it. We had a Navigator before. It started falling apart at 48k miles. We looked at and/or drove the Escalade, Yukon Denali, GL 450 and LX 470. For the price and features, you can't beat the QX. What other SUV includes as standard equipment a moonroof, Bluetooth, power fold flat seats, 20 inch chrome wheels, a navigation system, HID lights, a harddrive for music that rips CDs, a rear camera and rear sonar. While others may not care for the looks, I think it has one of the nicest interiors. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I got the new '08 QX56 as soon as it came out, I have about 500 miles on the car, I was waiting b/c improvements are so great over the '07. I traded in an Odyssey van. While the QX is true luxury, I have to say the Odyssey handles more smoothly on the road. I love the interior of the QX as well as all of the bells/whistles re: technology. I've only figured out about 60% of the features. In addition to the roughness on the road, I was also surprised by the engine noise/vibration under driver's seat while accelerating; I suppose that's due to the huge engine size.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just turned in my 04 Armada, got the 08 QX56, looking forward to a great sound system with all my music on the hardrive. Alas, I did not research it enough because I couldn't find any info it. Hardrive can only be loaded by recording CDs to it.Takes forever. I have no CDs anymore.The Compact Flash Medium is ill-conceived/junk. Infiniti sales people must have been told to play dumb because none of them acknowledge what a limited feature this is. Single CD player only. None of this info anywhere on website or marketing materials. I would not pay an extra nickel for it. Buy the Armada and don't option it. I had brake issues on the 04, I hope that is done with.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought this beast a couple weeks ago and love it. My wife carts the kids around in it mostly but I have had some fun in it too. Very easy to drive and tons more room than the Escalade ESV. Gonna cost me a ton in gas - wish they had the Flex Fuel option. From last year, they added a heated steering wheel, automatic fold down third row (folds flat), 10 GB hard drive, compact flash drive, aux jack for iPods, MP3 players, etc., and bigger 20" wheels. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>10 GB hard drive to download your cds (even stores the song names, artist, and album). Touch screen navigation along with voice recognition. Tons of leg and head room - I'm 6'7" and am very comfortable in 1st and 2nd row and can also fit in the 3rd row ok.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this big SUV days ago and it is the best car I ever had. The comfort, technology, engine response and features are way ahead any other SUV at this moment. The new features on the 08 model are exactly the ones I expected and the reason why I never bought a QX before. My previous car was an FX35 which I loved too, but it was kind of small for my family. I highly recommend this vehicle for a test drive, I am sure you won't be disappointed. The ride is much better than the previous version with the improved tire quality (Michelin) and 20" rims. The traffic feature helps you to avoid congested areas and is easy to use. The downside is fuel economy.</TEXT>
