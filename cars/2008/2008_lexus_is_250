<TEXT>I also had a problem with my brakes. When I back up the brakes squeak. With less than 10000 miles I'm sure it's not the brake pads. If it is, I would be disappointed. I enjoy the smooth ride. The cabin is tight, power is acceptable & the gas mileage is excellent.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I decided to purchase a pre-owned car I was looking at the class above the IS 250. I was looking at the Lexus gs, BMW 5 and audi a6. When my sales rep showed me the is 250 I fell in love with the way it looked. It has class that none of the others has. I traded in my 3 and after 27 days driving this car you can not compare the two. IS 250 is a perfect blend of fun and comfort...the BMW was fun only.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is not a bad car at all setting aside from numerous dealership visits within the 25k miles I have clocked with this vehicle. The engine is very smooth, quiet yet not as powerful as I would like, even with the manual transmission. The down points for this car is various suspension noises & horrible manual transmission/factory flywheel combo. At about 5000 miles, the manual transmission had to be replaced. Right after, various TSB's were performed for interior noises & passenger side front A-Pillar head air bag cover was replaced. Now I hear clanking in the suspension area when going over any type of bump or road imperfection. Also, interior plastic clips are getting loose which make noise.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good technology for the cheapest Lexus. I like the push button start & instrument cluster illumination. Stock stereo is good but made up for by using 13 speakers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A friend says I look like I'm driving a swan. Lovely Princess Shinjouku is Starfire Pearl, with Cashmere leather. Shinjouku is not nearly as ergonometric as my beloved Volvo, Lars (murdered by a Sequoia driven by a fool who ran a redlight at 80+ mph.). And the design is not as evolved. Doors & trunk drip inside when opened. I'm very agile, but have trouble getting out of the car. The car feels heavy, and the doors have the most amazingly precise and plush sound when they close. I cannot use the sound system. It hurts my ears. I bought for Prestige/reliability/safety/cost to own/beauty. Shinjouku is definitely beautiful: the prettiest Lexus yet. Just wish it were safer and quieter.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The beauty of the car. Absolute reliability (so far). Prestige, Fantastic mpg (30.6 overall, for me). Digital mileage display(s). The 'split 5-spoke' wheels are the least tacky of any currently being sold. Being pampered at the dealership. I'm hooked on the VIP treatment.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car is a luxury cruiser more than a sports sedan. to me it just doesn't compare to anything European unfortunately. The technology and features however are great and it is definitely an extremely comfortable car. I recommend using the sportshift mode, the power mode and turning off traction to get the most fun out of this vehicle. If I had to choose again I'd save a little longer and get the 350 if I had the choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car!! It handles excellent and the quality is very high. I have hit 37 mpg on the freeway just last week after filling up and thats with 6200 miles on the car. I do take care of my vehicles and maintain the oil changes. I do not race the car as it is only a 2.5L V-6 with 204 bhp. So, you out there that own one knows exactly what I'm speaking of. The car is not for racing. But it does hold its value in the market. Over-all, I give the car a 9 out of 10.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A wonderful car, equal or better than all its German competition. A pleasure to drive. My choice after testing new BMW 330i, Audi A4, Mercedes 280c. Now after owning for one year I know I made the right choice. Have not even visited the dealer since purchasing in Feb 2008. Very highly recommended car. Weak points: GPS lacks features like Garmin and TomTom ability to download POIs and traffic/speed camera locations. Even with the expensive GPS I still need to use my Garmin.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything! Mainly the rear camera and good sound system, cooled and heated seats, Key-less entry, lovely and easy to read instruments. I need spectacles to read, but can read all instruments on this car without any spectacles, day or night. With small updates this can be the best ever car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drove almost every comparable car over the two months prior to purchasing the Lexus IS 250 RWD with the 6 speed manual. My last few vehicles had 300 hp (Infiniti and BMW) but putting it to the pavement was not as much fun as with the Lexus 2.5L V6 6M. All I can say is that with the 6 speed manual transmission, the car is actually a well balanced fun car to drive. I drove a few automatics and didn't get the same feeling in the car. Also, I have upgraded lowering springs, cold air intake, catback exhaust, short throw shifter, 19 inch IS-F rims, and added a spoiler. The added power and greatly improved exhaust sound makes the car truly more fun than the BMW 335i or Infiniti G35</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Lexus and I upgraded from a car that is no longer available. I was first attracted to the car when I drove a friend of mine's car. Overall this is a great car. I agree that there are more powerful cars out there, but I wanted better gas mileage and less power. If more power is needed then the IS 350 is available. On the vehicle there is a POWER switch that changes the shift differential with a notable power increase. If you are looking, you may want to try this and save your self $4K. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I decided this car over the 3 series and A4. I'm glad I made the right choice for myself. This is a big upgrade from my last car. I had an 05 Accord. I like so many things about the car. From its looks to the interior , the handling and comfort. I have 2 kids (2 year old and 7 year old) and they fit fine with enough room. They even say its a cool car. The only downside is the acceleration and that doesn't matter much to me because I'm not racing but it still carries more then enough to be around the city. I would definitely recommend this car to anyone who is interested in getting one because the reviews helped me as well to purchase this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The overall design is a major style improvement from the previous model; now it looks more like a luxury vehicle. I think it's a great car for the money spent. People mistake this car as a sports vehicle; it's not. Consider it more of a luxury commuter. The car has lackluster performance but it is sacrificed for fuel economy. I have no regrets. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My Lexus is two month old and I'm very happy about my choice. I considered the Acura TSX and the Infiniti G35 but I went for the Lexus because I liked the design and wanted the 4WD. My only complaint is about the brakes: lots of dust on the rims of the front wheels and noise when you depress the brake pedal. This latter problem is rather annoying: every time I came to a stop and then release the brake pedal to move again the front brakes make a noise. I took the car to the dealer and they lubricated all the wheels but the problem still persists. I wonder if anybody else driving this car has had same problems. </TEXT>

<TEXT>First of all, is a 250, not a 350. I understand there is a minimal acceleration when I purchased the vehicle. I don?t EXPECT power or complaint lack of HP. If I did want HP, I spend another 4k. Vehicle engine is smooth; hardly notice any gears shift. Take turn with barely any body roll. Handling feels light and responsive and braking are good for a 250V6. Interior design is good, does not look cheap, except for the dash board. Lots of gadget available with the vehicle options/no options. This is a compact sedan, adequate interior space unless you?re 6+ ft. then gets something bigger. Overall, 250 for luxury commuting w/ great comfort and safety. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My first Lexus was the 2000 RX 300 AWD SUV, my 2nd was the one I traded for this IS, it was a 2006 RX 330. It was a lengthy decision process for me to figure out if I was ready to leave my love of SUVs. I made the right decision! I love this car! I'm saving a load of money due to it's great gas mileage! This car is the most fun to drive out of every single car I've ever driven.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Family member already has an ES, so Lexus was on the list. But never expected to get so much for so little. Matador Red Mica with Beige interior (upgraded with perforated leather, heat/cool seats/woodgrain finish) stands out in a crowd. Car has a strong mix of sensual looks combined with solid performance and unmistakable luxury inside and out. A solid performer for a daily driver and certainly worth the money. Better looking than BMW, better performance than Mercedes, hands down winner over Acura. Looked at every other car but this one. Have not regretted this decision one bit.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Huge departure for me. Have owned 13 other GM cars. May never go back after this purchase. This vehicle has made driving fun all over again. I can't wait to get in and ride every day. The blend of luxury and performance bring a smile to my face. The Japanese car makers GET IT.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is not my type of car, but I must say it's great for a luxury sedan. To start off with some negative points, it lacks on acceleration and power, rear legroom can be a problem, and the steering is a little too light. What I liked about it is the electronic gizmos and its great styling inside and out. It also has a good fuel economy. And it seems like I find out about a new hidden feature everyday.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Keyless entry - just touch the door handle and you're in, power switch, gear position indicator, the light color of the speedos, the sound system, aux standard, how the lights come on when you get near the car, if it's locked (almost like it senses you).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought my fully loaded Lexus IS250 with Xpack a few days ago. The driving characteristics of this car are wonderful. The same level of quality, comfort, and technology you would expect from Lexus with the added "pop" of a sportier car. I evaluated this car and a BMW 3-series and this won out easily - quality, ride, and efficiency. The BMW has better engine sound but you can add F-accessories to the IS if you really need the sound. Handling is better on the IS. Fuel economy is wonderful in the 25 range which is excellent for a spank'n new car and fairly aggressive driving. Smokey Granite Ext and Light Grey Int is a sharp look. I love the car will drive it for year</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>X-Package. The car holds the road really well. The modified suspension provides next to no body roll while still offering a nice "Lexus" ride. Definitely a difference when compared with the regular suspension.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned 7 BMWs, and currently own the 325xi. The Lexus does not have the reputation of BMW but trust me this is a great car. It is fun to drive and incredibly comfortable. Navigation, and sound system as well as ventilated seats are distinguishing features. I went to Lexus because their dealerships are second to none and their cars have earned the reputation as totally reliable. If this car gets 25 more horses and a slightly larger back seat it will surpass BMW. This is a sweet car for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Brief: a medium sized high technology, luxury sports car which will have 1 or 2 people in it most of the time. I researched and drove BMW, Audi and Mercedes before settling on Lexus. I was upgrading from a SAAB convertible. To compare the cars, you need to spec up each car equally, which I did. The Lexus is the best value by many thousands of dollars. The car is a powerful, smooth quiet ride if that is what you are looking for. My average speed around Sydney is 38 kph so top end performance is nice to brag about but not a decision maker. Add an extra year's warranty and a world rating of most reliable car and you have some very good reasons for buying an IS250. It exceeds the brief!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Practically, the touch screen for all the essential controls (air con, sound, GPS, telephone, rear camera) is so easy to use. The BMW, Audi and Mercedes have far less user friendly, non touch, user interfaces. The IS250 is a little pocket rocket of technology, I love adaptive cruise control!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The IS 250 handles tight around corners, accelerates great on highway. A bit of a delay from a stop, but kicks in real nice, with a sweet hum. The nav got some bad reviews, but I think its great. If you get the nav, take advantage and learn the voice commands! Interior is top quality. Love the leather (a/c seats), and how the dash isn't curved out. It's flat so front has good leg room. Saw some complaints about rear seat room. If you plan on ppl sitting in the back a lot, then you probably need a mini-van! Back seats are actually comfortable, but small with leg room. The exterior is the best! Lines are smooth where they should be and hard to give distinct Lexus style. Front is mean $ stylish!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Vented seats! No more sticking to the leather. Nav w/ bluetooth. Overall handling. ASL... really makes a difference in visibility! Exterior lines and design make this sporty and mean. Interior is great combo of sporty feel with luxurious Lexus quality. Display panel is sweet! Lighting really pops.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great car packed with amenities, exceptionally smooth driving, fun to drive in manual mode with paddle shifters. I recommend the all wheel drive version for superb handling. All controls such as audio, climate and navigation are easy to use with the touch screen. Very economical on gas 22.8 city driving and 32.5 on a short 200 road trip. My only complaint is the navigation system, I don't feel it is Lexus's place to decide when I or my passenger can use the system, it greys out and can't be used while in motion no other automakers that I'm aware of do this. IMO don't buy the navigation sysem until Lexus changes their policy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've read all of the reviews for this car on this website and where some I thought were very helpful, there were those that questioned things like the lack of horsepower, sound system, and build quality. For an entry level luxury car and a terrific base price, you can't get a better deal. The ride is tight with the Sport package but this is what I wanted in a sport compact. The power was surprisingly peppy, fun, and the growl at times was a nice tease that indicated there's still that hint of energy and adrenaline waiting to be let out. When needed, the car goes and in the cabin, the comfort conveniences are second to none. Excellent options and an excellent experience. Very satisfied!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very nice & refined car. AWD model accelerates fine. Very nicely finished interior. The rear seat is tight, but I knew this when I made the purchase. It was hard to find a model with the Luxury Package. Would not have purchased the car without that package. This package is what makes a Lexus a "Lexus". On the other hand the navigation system is not acceptable. A passenger cannot program the system while the car is in motion, does not announce street names, is very complicated to program. Do not waste your money on this inferior system. Instead purchase a $300.00 portable navigation system. They are easy to program, have "Text to speech", and have traffic updates.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Full disclosure: I am an engineer with 20+ years of quality experience, so I am very picky. This car is the perfect marriage of luxury and sports car. The build quality is very apparent, both inside and out. It is extremely quiet and smooth, although the suspension is a tad stiff on rougher roads. The paint is absolutely beautiful. Picking a color is the toughest decision, once you decide to buy. The engine will not impress true sports car enthusiasts, but I think Lexus hit the nail on the head by combining "very good" performance with "great" gas mileage. I'm getting 28 MPG consistently.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car about 5 days ago after deciding to trade in my 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe due to rising gas prices. I agree with several other peoples posts in regards to test driving this car just wasn't enough. After 5 days of owning this car I can honestly say that it is AWESOME. I commute in the Bay Area everyday and this car is by far the best I could have bought. The gas mileage is great, the luxury features are wonderful and the car looks/drives like a dream! Please keep in mind that I came from a 6,000lb SUV to this small Lexus sedan. I was very worried about the drastic change in vehicles and that I wouln't like being in a sedan. I have 0 buyers remorse and don't miss my SUV at all.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my IS250 1 week ago and so far it's been great! I have heard some complaints on how the initial pick up is lagging some, but I have yet to feel inadequate upon "take off". It's a smooth ride and really fun to drive. The navigation system takes a little getting used to-- it's really just a matter of getting the lingo down. I have the tan interior, which tends to get dirty rather quickly, but the perma-plate guard that they put on seems to be keeping the dirt off. The only thing I can complain about is the slightly small back seat (but hey, i'm not sitting in the back!!)and the blind spots. Other than that, I love it!</TEXT>

The interior is beautifully well crafted, but not as ergonomically friendly as the Acura. You feel more road irregularities, but if were expecting not to you bought the wrong car. My biggist gripe (and I hate to keep comparing the TL) is the Manual/Sport shift. Nowhere near as seamless as the Acura. Even worse is when you move your shifter over into that mode, the default gear is 4th - rather than the gear you were in. Pretty abrupt if your in 6th, which this car has you in most of the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the car a week and a half ago and really like what the car has to offer. Test drove a 335i sedan, infiniti g37, and an acura tl and tl type s. Went with the Lexus due to interior quality and richness and value compared to the bimmer. Coming from an Acura TL, the learning curve on using the nav system is huge. Toyota (Lexus) can learn quite a bit from how Honda (Acura) has implemented their nav interface. Drives like a charm, although I wish the steering would tighten up a bit at highway speeds. It would be nice to deactivate VSC and TCS while driving instead of bringing the car to a stop first. There is definitely room for improvement on the car. Fix the nav operation, add mem seats!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cooled seats, gas mileage (getting 30.8 according to onboard computer (mostly highway) ), stunning looks, the revving gauges at startup</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased this car because I needed an AWD vehicle but did not want an SUV. Test drove the Audi A4 but went with the Lexus b/c of reliability. This car is fun to drive and has made my commute more enjoyable. It needs more power. In the Power mode, it's a dream but in regular mode, it's quite sluggish. The ride itself is smooth and the interior is comfortable. I'm getting used to the brakes - I'm used to pressing the brake and coming to an immediate standstill, the brakes on the Lexus tend to "glide" a little more. The back seat is small but my 2 kids (age 9 and 3) don't seem to mind. Handles like a dream. Fuel economy is great. I love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was very impressed with the drivability of this car compared to the BMW and I'm looking forward to lower maintenance costs than my BMW or Audi. Comfy ride yet still good road feel so I know what's going on. Nice and quiet. Smooth transmission even with performance driving. Paddle shifters are convenient and give confidence when performance driving. Heated and cooled seats are very nice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for 1 month and it's been a blast to drive. I really like the interior and exterior styling and it has a very smooth ride to it. I looked at the G-35 and BMW 325 but you get more for the dollar on the lexus IS 250. Never really paid attention to Lexus before, but this is a great quality car. 31.7 MPG highway and 26 mixed. A 15 min test drive is not enough as I had to go back to drive it again. It took me several days to get used to driving this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>cooled/heated seats, good factory sound system, sharp turning radius for u-turns, excellent handling, responsive acceleration and great fuel economy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased by IS 250 two days ago and I love it. I traded an 07 Acura TL, but I drove the Mercedes C300, Audi A4 and VW Fahrenheit GLI. Glad I chose the IS 250 even though the horsepower is lacking and doesn't compare to the TL I had. I got an excellent deal on this car and the base model is loaded with everything I needed. I did get one with HID, 18" tires and upgraded rims and a few other items. Drive it and you'll want one for sure!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car a week ago, what a fun car to drive! It handled extremely well in the snow, AWD is great. I love the leather seats, smart key, radio. Paddle shifters are fun. Handles unbelievably!! However, the experience that has been awsome in everyway was dissipated when i found out that several nav system available while the car is parked become inaccessible when the car is in motion. In the name of safety according to lexus. If I were to agree that lexus can be my mother, I resent paying $2600 for a system that is literally crippled in my mind when the vehicle is motion. Save yourselves the money get the car without nav and by a $100 3rd party nav system instead.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The handling on this car is great. It is very reliable and stable at high speeds. The interior is a bit small but feels and looks luxurious. The horsepower is too low - it is missing that extra kick at acceleration. The standard audio system is bad quality; my Bose system in my 96 Maxima was 100% better. The bass is very weak and listening to music became a nuisance in this car. The car makes a weird sound from the rear passenger wheel which I told was normal. Overall, the car operates a bit noisy. The IS 250 is a nice car but I feel I could have gotten a better deal for the money spent. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the bluetooth - however some friends complain of weird noises when I talk to them using this option. The navagation is nice, I would have preferred that the voice commands came out of all speakers not just the driver's side and it would be nice if the music automatically turned low.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is an early review, I just purchased my new 2008 Lexus IS 250 AWD, Starfire Pearl. BMW 325i owner, so standards were high, researched and drove 2008 BMW 328i, Audi A4, Infiniti G35, all excellent cars, tough decision. IS 250 needs more power, but overall great handling, love styling, features great, excellent service and prestigious!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling features, AWD, tight cornering in bad weather a dream. Xenon with AFS, start/stop button, unique design compared to other sports sedans, love color Starfire Pearl. Fully loaded, love dial switch moonroofs, hate holding my finger on older buttons.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought this car. Styling, leather seats, radio, all creature comforts are great. Do not buy this car if you do not like the ride and feel of low profile tires. The ride is bumpy on the highway, and I can feel every uneven road surface and pothole . I'm very disappointed with my purchase. A 10 - 15 minute test drive was not enough time to get the true feel of this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm not suffering a second of buyer's remorse. The car is a kick to drive, it is loaded with features, and everything about is pleasing to the senses (I find myself just touching various surfaces and marveling at how perfect they all seem). It's tempting to think of the IS as a "budget Lexus". That may have been true of the 300, but this is genuinely a luxurious car--all Lexus. I'm getting about 32mpg on the highway and mid-20s around town. Much better than the new EPA ratings.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hard to say. The car has so many great little features. Overall, I'd have to say the smooth and quiet ride, coupled with a genuine small-sports- car feel in maneuvering. The car just has everything going for it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove this car expecting to not be impressed and I was completely wrong. It looks great, feels great, is very luxurious, and has a lot more pick- up speed than the 250 suggests. I couldn't believe what the base model came with. The comperable BMW didn't even have leather and you had to pay a significant amount more for basic features.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Excellent car. Really hugs the road, quick acceleration (not as peppy as the 350, but enough for a 36 year old). I was in the market for a "Certified Pre-Owned" 2006 or 2007, and ended up getting a new one for a few thousand more. Tells me they keep their resale value moreso than others I compared it to.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at the Mercedes c300 first but opted for the IS 250 instead. I have owned the IS 250 for 2 months now and the car is fun to drive. The 250 does get good gas mileage also. Rear seat legroom is minimal. One drawback is the paint. Already chipping on the front. I've owned other cars for years before the painted started to chip.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wonderful car all around. I added the HID headlights, XM radio, vent seats, and wood trim. The base models come pretty well loaded. While not a pure sports car, it has found a perfect balance between luxury and sportiness. The ride is as quiet and smooth as can be. When you test drive it, be sure to take in on some bumpy roads. You will feel the difference. I am 6'1" and still fit comfortably into the front seats. No one can fit into the back seat behind me though. The trunk, while not very big, was able to fit my ice hockey goalie equipment. I also test drove the Mercedes 300, BMW 325XI, loaded '08 Honda Accord V-6 Coupe among others. In my opinion, the best value for your money. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tight, responsive handling. High quality and simple interior details. Love the AWD (live in the northeast). The smooth and almost silent drive. Passenger and driver power seats that move back and give you great leg room in the front. Get the navi and rear view cam if you can afford it, worth it. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>For the price of a base, it's a great overall value for a luxury vehicle. I purchased only the leather package with automatic. Handles well, lovely interior (doesn't feel like plastic) which is important for me. I take clients out in this vehicle with good overall feedback. Base sound system is decent, includes as base a 6CD changer. Previous car was a Acura 3.2TL with a premium package; only difference I've found is that the Lexus handles better, smaller and maneuvers like a small car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I can't say I've ever owned a BMW or Audi (though I have driven them), so take note. I can say, however, that I love the IS 250 AWD. Looks great on the inside and the outside and drives well too. It may not be the 500HP BMW M5, but it has zip and the handling is phenomenal. The fuel economy is a bit on the low side, at about 22MPG for my driving. In extended highway driving (even avg. 90MPH) I've gotten the avg. up to 27.5mpg, so I think that the 26MPG # is a bit low. No complaints so far... except that it's too damn much fun to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had an Audi that was about to bite the dust - thing was an absolute money pit. Fortunately, our other "family" car was a Lexus RX and we've had nothing but a stellar Lexus ownership experience, so when I decided to buy another AWD car, the IS 250 AWD had to be on the list. The car has not disappointed. Handles beautifully, looks good, plush inside and best of all it's a Lexus, so you know build quality and ownership experience will be top notch. Get the nav package (w/Bluetooth and rearview camera) - worth every penny. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove every car in this price range and the Lexus made my decision so easy! It comes with many features in the base model that other cars you pay extra for (like 6 CD changer, iPod adaptor, sunroof, leather, premium sound, smart key). I got the base model because I felt like it was already very loaded. It handles so smooth and tight. My previous car was a 330i BMW and there is no comparison. My BMW had the premium package and still was not as loaded as the base model Lexus. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like how you can buy XM or Sirius and you don't have to buy a whole package to get it. Many other car companies only offer satellite in a whole package. I also like the way the base model is very well equipped. I love the smart key, the way the stereo sounds & automatic headlights! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Do not test drive it unless you wanna bring it home that night. I'm serious. I went into the dealership just to check out pricing and test drive it, then spent the next couple hours figuring out how I can afford the payments. It was that easy. Smooth, smooth ride, very quiet, nice stereo system, and paddle shifters when you want that manual tranny feel. Leather is so soft, and vented seats a nice touch. Real fun to drive. Get looks from many people as I drive by.</TEXT>

The C 350 was the only car in class that can hold a candle to this car in all-around characteristics. The IS 250 in the 6 speed manual, gives you the performance that you're looking for. While other cars in the class will be slightly faster, none had as nice of a feel in shifting and ride comfort at the Lexus.</TEXT>
