<TEXT>Toyota and Honda is the only thing my wife had ever driven. But unlike myself she is utterly terrified of driving in the snow. She refused the idea of an SUV and neither Honda or Toyota offers an AWD alternative. I suggested a Suburu Legacy and she reluctantly test drove the Legacy 2.5I SE. She was hooked within the first 5 miles although we drove it another 50 before returning to the dealership. But the story doesn't end there. The snow would be the real test, after all, the AWD was the main reason for the purchase. Well, after 11 trips in mild to heavy snow she was convinced this was the best purchase she ever made in her life. Yup, in her life. Wow... For that she gives it a perfect ten!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Legacy with 6400 miles on it. The dealer told me it was a program car and that an executive from Subaru headquarters in Mass drove it. Come to find out it was a rental car. I bought this car because its safety, style, comfort, AWD, and because I did not want to be another guy driving in a cookie cutter car (Camry, Accord). This car has good pick up same as Camry, Accord. Same MPG too darn good for AWD. The Subie suspension is great. Nice balance of ride and handling. The boxer engine also is silky smooth and sounds good too. A boxer engine the pistons are horizontally opposed. Same as Porsche boxer design has lower center of gravity better handling, best value for its class. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a Subaru because I like the performance & handling of a German car but wanted the reliability & value of a Japanese car. I got exactly that. The only problem in two years has been a dash rattle that the dealer fixed with a foam jam (I know, but it's not a luxury brand). It would be nice to get over 30 mpg's, but the trade-off is outstanding traction, performance and safety. Having survived a serious accident, safety is a major concern of mine. No regrets here. This is my first Subaru and I know it will be hard to talk myself into buying anything else again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Okay, I almost feel guilty for driving this car. I luckily found it used because you don't see a "used" Subaru very long on the lot (especially as nice as this one) and I've been looking. I feel bad because it is soooo good. I have two friends who drive new BMW's and I can easily keep up with the Jones'. This car does everything well, including looking the part of a luxury sport sedan. Very fun to drive, handles well, and fuel economy is great for AWD. Speaking of AWD...it is wonderful in the rain..can't wait for snow. I am dating up because this car has hot looks and delivers performance even for a 4 cyl. When I tell people what I paid...they are filled with jealousy. Don't miss out! </TEXT>

<TEXT>After one year, and 25000 miles, I couldn't be happier. I drive 30 to and from work over a 7000 ft+ mountain summit to a city that has 3 of the top 10 ski resorts in the country within 5 miles. Naturally, traction is a concern. After having a Honda Civic Si and snow tires, I will never be without quality winter tires again because getting going is one thing, stopping is another, and the Legacy does both brilliantly when properly equipped. I confidently and safely got where I was going (and passed so many 4WD trucks and SUV's I couldn't even venture a guess at a number). I am so glad I bought this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD for sure. Love the AUX input on the stereo. Unlike some of the reviews, I think the stereo sounds great. I love that the rear speakers are in the doors rather than the behind the seats. I can have the stereo at a level everyone can hear yet still talk to people in the backseat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far I've owned my Legacy for a little over a month and I have to say it's by far the best car I've ever owned. I was in the market for a car that was great on the highway (safe/mpg/fun to drive) since I drive an hour each day to and from work. I will surely be purchasing another Subaru whenever this one bites the dust hopefully a long time from now. I love the sound system, was able to tweak the quality of the speakers through my ipod, the moonroof is wonderful and the car handles like it's on rails. I highly recommend anyone that wants a great car at a great price, pre-owned might be the way to go. Low miles for 5k cheaper than new a year old?...be stupid not to.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a 2008 used Subaru Legacy with 20,000 miles on it in March 2009. The only complaint I have is that after I drive it and then turn the engine off, it makes a ticking sound for approx 20 secs as though the engine is cooling down. I never heard this sound in other cars I've owned, so it's new to me. I'm wondering if anyone else has had this problem, and if it's common. The dealer said it's the engine cooling, but I'm leery of it. The engine sounds more like a cheap car and is not as quiet when started or when driving. I've owned a Honda and Dodge, Intrepid and they seemed more sturdier than the Subaru Legacy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>While the 3.0R boasts a larger engine and more hp, it actually has less lb/foot of torque than its 2.5GT counterpart; translating to 7 tenths of a second from 0-60. The acclaimed S/I drive is amusing, if not practical. In sport mode acceleration is noticeably boosted from intelligent mode. Paddle-shifting is also available in sport sharp, though its more burdensome than liberating. Paddle-shift levers, S/I drive console, and Navigation system all contribute to the impressive interior. Even after the romance fades, the controls are insightful and convenient. This car may be your best choice if: a. you drive in all-weather conditions b. you purchase used at a discount</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 3.0R's best feature is not unique. All Subaru's are endowed with excellent symmetrical AWD. The 3.0R offers Subaru's AWD in a more refined and elegant package, setting it apart from other Legacy and Impreza models. The wheels, though not a practical benefit, complete the look nicely.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was lucky enough to get the last '08 on the lot and I got leather, heated seats, heated mirrors, heated wipers, 6 disc changer and auto climate control! This is easily the nicest car I've ever owned. Fit and finish and quality of materials is amazing. My girlfriend's mom has a 328xi and I honestly think this car is nicer inside and out. Bottom line, try a Legacy before you go for an Audi, BMW, or Lexus... you may be surprised.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I waited to post a review of this car until we had time to really evaluate it. After 9 mos. & nearly 11K miles we are very satisfied. The interior is the best, period. Its design looks better than any luxury sedan on the market. Handling is very good but you give up a soft ride for it. We average about 30 mpg at 80 mph and 23 around town. Still feels solid and has been totally trouble free. We drove Audi A4, BMW 3, Jag X, Volvo S40 & S60. Simply this car felt better and looked better too. If you want an awd car that is reliable, economical, and near luxury, this is the one. Leather is nice, stereo is okay but wish it had steering mounted controls (fixed in 2009). Highly recommend.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a 2008 Legacy in mid 2007 and it has been hands down the best vehicle I've owned. Its hard to find a high quality sedan that's not too large. The interior is quiet and materials are superior to others. The design is perfect - everything is proportional, unlike so many new sedans that look "different" to get attention. I always buy new cars and this is the first one to go the first 20k miles without even one tiny, minor little thing to look into. It's been fantastic and I'll definitely buy another.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Subaru Legacy 2.5l boxer engine has to be one of the better small size engines on the market today. Besides delivering almost 30 mpg on the high way it can pack a little punch if pushed to its limits. It's more fun to drive than anything I test drove (which included Toyota awd matrix, Nissan altima, Honda accord). The all wheel drive is superb. Anything from heavy rains to deep snow is no match for the symmetric all wheel drive. Last its not cheap by any means but for what you get it is one hell of a deal. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car for Colorado. Does great in the snow and I get good MPG. I can chase BMW Xis and Audi A4s all day to the ski resorts, I might not be as fast as they are, but I can handle all the sludge on the road with easy and knowing that I can buy 2 Subarus for the price of one BMW or Audi it makes me smile when i park next to them. Great everyday car at a price that doesn't make you hate yourself every month! I think it will hold its value better as well! I'm getting 27 mpg with a space box on the roof. Would recommend this car to anybody that needs AWD!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Spec B is a great low profile performance sedan. The Euros can't match the performance or reliability for the money. Add snow tires (the stock Bridgestones are summer only) for winter and you have an unstoppable all season sport sedan. Having owned a Mercedes C230 and a BMW 328i, I can say the Subaru is much more fun to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When I bought an Acura TL a year ago, the Legacy was my second choice. I recently reversed that decision and traded the TL for the Suby. What a difference! I love the sports car handling and the AWD because I live in a part of Canada that gets a lot of snow in winter. It's the first car I've looked forward to driving every day since I sold my Miata. Acceleration is impressive in sport sharp mode. My TL had crazy, dangerous torque steer when accelerating hard in corners. The Suby is tight, predictable, with a slight rear wheel bias. The interior looks great and fits me well, except for the arm rest (needed to get the extender). Bluetooth would be nice, but shouldn't talk on the phone anyway.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, acceleration, great AWD traction, refined interior, grippy leather, tight turning radius, great value, great looking alloy wheels, perfect clutch feel, low center of gravity, 3 personalities with iDrive. I've owned about 40 cars in my life. This could be my favorite.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned Subarus for several years, mostly WRXs. I finely decided to try a Legacy GT. I am really glad I did. It is a great car, having good power, and more luxury than the WRXs I owned. Subaru has done a great job on the entire design, and functionality of the Legacy GT. I have added a Stage one Cobb Accessport, and it changed an already good performing car into a really GREAT performing car. The added hp/torque from this programmer really changes the entire character of the engine, without cutting the mpg. It's the best $695.00 I ever spent!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned Lexus LS, Toyota Camrys and Corolla, BMW 3/5/Z4 series, and Honda Civic. Hadn't ever looked at Subaru before but researched sedans with top safety ratings and the Legacy stood out. I have had the car for 2 days and am very pleased with how well it was designed and built. Very well appointed, great value, above average performance, even providing a bit of luxury but without being pretentious in any way. Fuel economy like a small SUV, requires premium gas and frequent oil changes. More fun than a Camry/Corolla or Accord/Civic but just as practical and more bang for your buck than Lexus or BMW.</TEXT>

I love the look of the car the solid drive and very quiet, I can actually listen to the radio at number 4. I am 6'2'' and I fit with with headroom to spare this is the first car that I can have a moon roof. When you push this car in the corners you can feel how well it handles.

<TEXT>I was hoping to get a nicer car but with gas prices exceeding $4 a gallon I didn't want to be getting 17 mpg so I leased this Subaru Legacy for 2 years at an excellent rate. It gives me an average of 31.2 mpg overall and it has decent kick for a 4 cyl. I also own a 2003 Forrester but is noisy on the highway, this car is solid, very little road noise. I only got the VDC because that's all there was, I mainly turn it off. The leather is nice and along with the wood trim, it makes the car feel much more than $26k. The only complaint is that its a bit small. Wishing I bought it so I don't have to worry about mileage, much better then expected :D</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned Audis, BMWs, VWs, and I looked at them all again before buying Subaru. It's got push-you-back-in-the-seat power, stealthy looks, and features that costs lots more $$$ on the other brands. I couldn't be happier with it. Very high Fun To Drive factor and is always ready to do more. Handles great in the snow as well. When I'm nice to it, I get 31 MPG hwy, when I'm not, 20 - 22. It's a nice surprise and everyone asks me what kind of car it is when they see it on the road. Big difference between standard legacy and legacy GT. It's worth the difference in price.</TEXT>

This car is in its own class, you really can't compare it to any others (many people think the car looks way more expensive then it actually is). I get great gas mileage, better then they say! I average 28-29 MPG with 75% highway and 25% city. I can't go anywhere with out people asking me what kind of car I drive. The Legacy is so comfortable, and the handling is great! I would recommend this car to anyone. Before buying any other car, you must test drive the Subaru Legacy. I swear, you won't regret it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>In 34 years I have owned a lot of sports cars and SUVs. The Subaru GT is my favorite. It provides almost sports car like power and handling. It rides like a comfortable sedan. It takes the Utah snow without any drama. I get 28 mpg hwy and 22 mpg around town according to the trip computer. That includes jumping on it a little. I am considering installing the SPT exhaust system, heat shield and high flow exhaust. The factory quotes 30HP and 30 ft-lb torque gains.</TEXT>

This is the best car I have ever owned after the going though so many problems with my Envoy which is a okay. I never had so much fun driving car other than this one. My fuel mileage is not so great yet but I have only had this car for 4 days so the engine needs time to break in. I think in time the fuel mileage will get better and it already better than my SUV. I love going around conners and I can't wait for the Saskatchewan winters. That's when this car is going to show it strips with it AWD.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Subaru this April. Since I live in a place (SLC) that has long snow season, I wanted a car that is reliable & fun to drive. SUV was out of question due to gas prices. Subaru Legacy had everything I was looking for & I simply love this car. Just got back from our first long trip to Vegas and fuel economy was unbelievable. 32.7 MPG on freeway, even with AC on it was above 31.2 MPG. Handling was great.

<TEXT>1000 miles so far. Overall this is a quality car. I traded a Mazda 3.

<TEXT>I bought my Subaru Legacy about 3 months ago and I must say its a very great car for the price. I'ts the 4 cylinder Special Edition version. It has plently of power to merge on the highway and pass. It handles great at high speeds. I can only imagine what the GT version is like if this one has this much performance. I get 25mpg and thats 90% city driving. Highway I can get about 30mpg. I push it a lot since im a college student and love to accelerate. AWD is great in the rain, can't wait for the winter to really test it out again. Overall, great car and I would recommend it to anyone. Good quality all around.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Coming from an unreliable 2006 Volvo S40, the Legacy is like a scaled-down version of God! The Legacy is so reliable, so practical, and so capable. The handling is unbelieveable in the Legacy. I can take a sharp turn at 70mph and there's barely any body roll! The trunk is huge, I've gotten 4 suitcases in there with ease. The ride is super smooth, thanks to the Yokohama tires and suspension. I drove it during a heavy snow/ice storm this winter and it never slipped! The engine also makes a great noise when you really push it. Why aren't Subarus as popular as Hondas and Toyotas? They are heads and tails above the competition, and no one seems to know about it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded in my '01 Maxima SE for a '08 Legacy SE and I have no regrets. I find the passenger cabin to be slightly smaller than the average sized American might like it to be, but otherwise I have no complaints. I managed to get over 29 MPG on my first two tanks of gas with mixed driving. I've been pushing it a little harder lately and I'm still getting over 26 MPG! It usually sticks to the road like glue, but I managed to get it to hydroplane in heavy rain. I attribute this to a combination of driving conditions and slightly overinflated low profile tires. I haven't driven it in the snow yet, but I took it down a muddy dirt road and was very impressed with the AWD system. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Subaru wasn't even on my radar until my friend asked me to check them out. I needed to upgrade from my 2-door Civic because we just had a kid (so my excuse is "it's for the kid" :-P). It rides great and is very safe. I got the special edition because I wanted the moon roof and I am not disappointed. I also got the manual transmission and it is very smooth in operation. My wife loves it and thinks I made a great buy. I have enjoyed the extra room and will recommend Subaru to anyone in the future.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is everything I hoped it would be. It is quiet, feels tight, handles well and gets good gas mileage. It is smaller than expected inside but it is fine since I am in the car by myself 90% of the time. There is a lack of storage space but I try not to keep much junk in the car anyway. It has good acceleration performance for a 4 cylinder too. The build quality is top notch. Very pleased with it and the price was unbeatable by any of the comparably equipped competitors. Plenty of standard safety features as well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I upgraded from a 2005 Honda Accord Special Edition Coupe, and I'm very satisfied with my choice. Subaru was definitely not a brand I would have considered, but when I saw the Legacy, I fell in love with it. The car has a look that rivals its German counterparts, yet it drives and feels like a true Japanese car that dominates its path. The Legacy has enough power to pass as a basic 6-cylinder, but it has the awesome gas mileage of a 4cyl., even with AWD!!! The design of this car is superb, and the standard features are truly unbeatable! If you're looking for a car that's not basic, but not expensive, this is the car to look at! Once you drive it, you'll refuse to look at anything else!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD was the biggest selling point for me. Living in snowy areas means preparing for winter at all times, and this car can handle it all! The handling of the car, the flat Subaru Boxer designed engine, the safety features, and the overall look and build quality of this car are phenomenal! Best deal.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall a great car. Just the right size, handles wonderfully, and great on gas (if you are easy on the accelerator). Dark grey color is beautiful - get compliments constantly. AWD works great, even with stock tires. Back seat can be tight for larger adults. Build quality is good, other than one minor trim piece was misaligned. Overall, ride is good, but the low profile 17" wheels add some disruption to the ride. My major gripe is no radio controls on steering wheel - ridiculous for a 26K vehicle. The car will be too small for some, but it's the perfect size for me & my needs. Acceleration is OK - there is enough power for most, but the power-hungry should go for the turbo.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD, leather, overall interior ambiance, satellite radio integrates beautifully with stock stereo (little delay between channel changes), car feels "solid" - from the "thunk" of the door to the radio buttons, locking glove box, sunroof.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We currently own a 2004 Forester which my wife drives and loves. But the Forester is very noisy above 50 MPH. We bought a 2008 Legacy 2.5i Limited and I have driven it just under three hundred miles. The trip computer makes you very conscious of your gasoline consumption. I averaged 28.4 MPG on the first tankful. This was town and country mileage. The car is quiet and reassuringly rigid. Several people have complained about the sound system. Maybe I have tin ear but the system sounds just fine to me. As far as I am concerned, this is another outstanding car from Subaru. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle has been outstanding in every way so far. Stylish, responsive, quiet, safe and the balanced design makes it a pleasure to drive. This is our first import and our first 4 cylinder so we researched quite a few vehicles. Once we settled on Subaru, we looked hard at the 2.5 GT turbo. That said, we have no regrets about the decision to go with the standard 2.5i. Plenty of power. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the sporty exterior design and the color (diamond grey metallic) but the AWD and safety features sold us.

<TEXT>I originally looked at this car as it was the best price for the amenities. 5 Star safety, power everything, AWD, 4 cyl gas mileage, plus it has the history of Subaru quality. What I found out after I drove it was that I not only lost the bad mileage of a V6, but I gained the nice power of a 4 cyl Boxer engine. I have no problem getting onto highways, passing, I even safely avoided an accident with the car's superior handling. If you're looking for something safe, but don't want to feel like you're trading your youth, then this car is a must to test drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All Wheel Drive. This is something you will notice. The SE edition is only a few thousand more and makes the car a steal.

I wanted all wheel drive and I didn't want to defer to the Hondas and Toyotas mainly because they bore me and you see them everywhere. I was contemplating spending some bigger bucks for the Audi A4 or the Infiniti G35x. Obviously those cars are much quicker, but when I found out that the Legacy had comparable interior, as comfortable a ride and was much cheaper, I decided to go with the Subaru. When compared to the others that were mentioned, I sacrificed speed for cheaper gas, parts, insurance, monthly payments and increased mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owing German performance sedans for the past 15 years, I test drove the 2008 Legacy 2.5 GT Limited with the 2.5 turbo boxer four mated with the five-speed automatic trans. I absolutely loved the car. It looked good. The interior was well-appointed. The steering was precise. The handling was exceptional. The ride was very good. The engine was surprisingly responsive and powerful. The price was extremely competitive. The only negative is the automatic transmission. The gear changes are sluggish and delayed. Even when manually changing gears with the paddle shifter, there is significant delay. If not for the auto trans, it gets all "10s".</TEXT>

This car is great on the highway and still firm enough to have fun on the twisty roads. I was averaging 28 mpg on the highway with a new engine with less than 100 miles. Germany should be afraid with the performance of the Legacy and the proven reliability of Subaru. I recommend a test drive of the GT, you will not be disappointed</TEXT>

<TEXT>After having to take a break from the Germans for a while this was an unexpectedly great car. It really is the Japanese BMW (without the BMW stigma!). The build quality is excellent. The handling, chassis dynamics and rigidity are very impressive. The all-wheel drive system does its job without you knowing. The flat four's power delivery is super smooth, though a little weak. The suspension is very compliant yet tight enough to not be sloppy. Once the motor gets broken in the gas mileage is pretty good. The 5-speed is notchy and vague unless you shift with a light hand and let the shifter find the gates instead of you putting it in the gates. Overall, it is a tremendous value.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It really is one of the best kept secrets in the sports sedan segment, which I love. I don't see myself on every street corner (can you say 3-series and A4?). All-wheel drive, the flat four, build quailty, driving dyanmics, etc.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have traded in my Accord Ex for the 2008 Legacy Limited with VDC. The Legacy is by far a much better vehicle than the Accord. The Accord is a good ride but it can't match the Legacy in handling and in acceleration. The steering feels very balance in the AWD Legacy; you don't have the torque steer kickback of a front wheel drive car. The gas mileage is about the same as the Accord, which is quite good. The 4 speed auto transmission works well with the 2.5 engine. I have no problem merging into the freeways and zipping aound town. The ride is very comfortable and controlled. I have owned many brands (MB, BMW, Acura, Honda, Jeep, Nissan) and the Legacy is the best car for the money. </TEXT>

Subaru finally had enough of the amenities with the 2008 Limited GT Turbo model for me to make the purchase. What a value! The car is more fun to drive than the BMW, much faster, and hopefully will be more reliable. With discounts and rebates, the car is approximately $12,000 less than a similarly equipped 2008 325xi.

<TEXT>Researched small AWD sport sedans for over 3 months and drove the Audi A4, BMW 328i, Acura TSX, Lexus IS 250 and Volvo 2.5. The Legacy GT out performs all of them at a price that is $10,000 less than the 3 series. Build quality is superb, and the ride is extremely quiet for a 3200 pound sedan. The negatives are: the rear seat is a tad firm, but more than adequate for anyone less than 6 feet on an all day trip and lack of storage compartments.

<TEXT>I have owned two Audis and one VW over the last several years and gave up that family due to reliability problems with all three cars. The GT seems like a car with many of the features of the Audi world for less money. Interior is certainly better than most cars in its class, but not quite up to Audi / VW standards. Performance: still unsure about the automatic transmission. This is my first automatic in several years and I'm having trouble adjusting. It's nice when stuck in traffic, but it does take some of the fun out of the car. The paddle shifters help make up for some of that; even when in drive you can quickly downshift without having to change into manualmatic mode.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded my beloved 05 WRX wagon in due to a foot injury that made shifting the manual trans difficult. I was looking at the 6-cyl 3.0R model, then I drove it... really slow! The 2.5GT was quite a bit faster but still much slower than my WRX. Ah well, the Legacy IS a heavier car and it has an auto trans. I do like the 5-speed auto for what it's worth, and the paddle shifters are a cool touch. The SI-Drive feature is a bit gimmicky really, as the three different maps aren't too much different. You still need to put your foot down to get good speed with the Sport Sharp mode. Interior quality is top-notch and the ride is smooth and quiet otherwise. Happy to own my second Subie!</TEXT>

Performance could be called "stealth": quiet and comfortable until you hamnmer it! After comparing to the G35X, A4 3.2L, Passat 4Motion and Mazdaspeed 6, this car is the clear winner to me with great build quality, performance, balance of ride and handling and the ability to get a 6M tranny vs. an auto.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Replacing a truly wonderful Mazda 6S, I resisted the Outback wagons opting instead for the understated 2.5i limited sedan. The ride is unusually smooth and the center of gravity very low. I'm most surprised by the transmission, however. Though its only a 4 speed, it's got enough low end torque for darting around town and an easy, relaxed cruising gear. I get 29 mpg average, impressive especially considering the AWD. Inside, it's in another class compared to the competition: quiet, elegant and everything is within easy reach, and the jewel-like instrument cluster is very classy. But best of all, the symmetrical AWD is just incredible and has a well-deserved reputation.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Symmetrical AWD, 29 MPG, smart auto transmission, remote start, heated seats/mirrors/wipers, bombproof reliabilty, interior finish with high quality leather, paint finish is defect free and remarkably nice, and overall build quality really is impressive. This car is a huge value for the money.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great car - rides smooth, corners well, sounds great! Can't wait to open her up after the 1K mile break- in period with the Sport Sharp mode. Everywhere I go people are asking "What's that?" and are amazed at not only the style, but the features, performance and out-the-door cost. This is my first Subie and I think I'm going to be a lifelong customer. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Paddle shifters, navigation, telescoping steering column, mp3 jack in center console, bolstered and perforated leather seats, HUGE trunk, sporty suspension/ride, AWD. Favorite add-ons are the subwoofer, Momo shift knob, sunroof air deflector, mud guards and all-weather floor mats. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Been car shopping for a long, long time. Looked at almost everything out there, MBs, BMWs, Evos, Stis, etc. Saw an 06 LGT spec B and wasn't completely sold on the interior color. When the 07s came out I was disappointed by the blue inserts. 08 rolled around and finally an all black interior! So far with about 500 miles on it I am still happy. With the 6spd I am having problems finding the right gear at the right time (used to 5 spds). 1st and 2nd seem kinda gutless. It's annoying to have keep putting the car into sport sharp. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav, outside temp display, sunroof, a sports sedan with some power under $40k that has all black interior. Big fan of auto dimming mirrors. With some mods it should be as fast, and handle as well as I'd want it to be. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Owned and loved a 2.5RS since '97! Very agile car and wonderful off roads but it had missing features when the kids came: folding seats, tiny backseat, latches, high profile trunk (cargo nightmare), stripped interior. Looked at the 328ix, LS 350, Evo, STi, TT, G35, 6s. All great but the spec.b outperformed and had everything I wanted on my RS. "The WRX's older brother," a lot of punch with significantly more sophistication. Interior features and ride make this a serious luxury car with a kick. The spec.b was not designed to be as rugged as the RS (my off trail days on hold!) but I'm very happy with my purchase and ecstatic now that I've had it for 6 weeks and booked 4-digit miles :)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>'08 interior black (not blue) is more accessible. Seats fold down 60/c/40, fantastic leather seats, great interior, 6-speed, low profile trunk, brakes not too sticky. Shocks, shocks, shocks! I/GT has .a lot of body roll. The spec.b ride is much tighter, stiffer and enjoyable. FCons = RS.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car! I looked at many cars over several weeks and decided that the Subaru Legacy was the best value for performance, safety, and comfort. The car is quiet, smooth, and so elegant inside. I have so much fun driving the car. It has the handling of a European sedan and the reliability of a Japanese car. I recently drove the car during heavy rain and flooding - it maintained its stability like a tank. I'm very happy with my decision. If you are considering an Accord or Camry, don't make a decision until you try the Legacy. You'll be shocked by the difference!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, ride, quietness, crash test results, heated wipers, integrated antenna, powerful headlights, heated side-view mirrors, anti-glare rear-view mirror, subwoofer (a must to upgrade standard audio), and extensive warranty coverage (includes wear items, such as brakes, for 1st 3 yrs).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a great car. My wife and I have been looking for a car for her for quite some time. We tested MB C Class, BMW 3s and Audi A4s. The Subaru by far out classed them on the roadways. Its handling in our opinion matched or outperformed the others. Its comfort is amazing and the power is wonderful. The 243 HP feels strong and you never need more. The car handles superbly at highway speeds and is even better in the curves. What a great car and I would recommend it to anyone. My next car will definitely be a Subaru. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats, handling and power. The overall looks of the car and enough room for our baby seat in the back!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased our Legacy GT Spec B in March after looking at it at the auto show and at the dealership. The interior is very well designed, great seats (heated is a nice touch), everywhere you feel there are no gaps, it's a very well put together car. The 6 speed makes it a very fun car to drive with the turbo 4. Easy to manuever around town, very capable highway cruiser.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats - very supportive, comfortable for long drives, six speed manual boxer turbo four cyclinder is an amazing engine </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has everthing you want and the quality of material they used is worth its price. Handling is really smooth, gas mileage is not that bad but it's not that great, that what you would expect from AWD car anyway. Over all I love this car because of the shape and features that it offers for the price. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD, new front shape, heated seats, heat windshield wipers and side mirrors for winter.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just traded my 2006 Xterra for this Subaru. Big difference, so I won't even try to compare the two. However, I did recently trade in my Mazda 6s, and I must say that the Subaru is almost every bit as fun to drive as the Mazda. The Subaru has a few points going for it over the Mazda. 1. All Wheel Drive 2. I'm not constantly worrying that the automatic transmission is going to overheat and destroy itself. 3. The Subaru's transmission computer is adaptive to the driver. The Mazda had pre-selected shift points that forced the car in overdrive before the RPMs even matched the gearing of the car. Besides, the car would never downshift while slowing down! Subaru has won my business.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All-wheel-drive, exterior/interior styling. Ok, just about everything.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Went to dealer with wife to have the 05 ob xt ltd serviced and walked out with a new 08 spec B. First one the dealer had. Probably the first one in the area too. We both fell in love with it. It can be compared to a BMW 328xi but $10,000 cheaper. Ride is firm and tight yet smooth even with the 18 inch summer performance tires. Clutch and shifter silky smooth. Handles great. Sticks like glue on turns. Power in stong. Can get out of the way in 6th gear. Everything is where it should be right at your finger tips. Radio and navi are wonderful. This is my 6th subie and definitely the best one. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Memory seat are a must when 2 people share a car. Radio controls on the steering wheel are real nice. The iPod jack in arm rest is the perfect spot.</FAVORITE>
