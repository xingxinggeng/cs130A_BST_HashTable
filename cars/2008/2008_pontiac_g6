<TEXT>I panicked and traded in my 01 Tacoma TRD for this when gas was almost 5 bux/gallon in cali. I kinda regret it. It had about 28k miles when i got it, and they didn't tell me it was a had been a rental until i was signing the papers. The gas mileage is ok, i get about 18-20 in town depending how i drive, but on the 6 hr drive home, i can get 30 mpg if i stay at 65-70. I struck a deer back in jan, and the car actually held up pretty well. I am now thinking of trading it in due to pontiac goin bye bye and getting a silverado etx cab. Overall, this car isn't bad, but isn't great. I'd suggest a toyota or honda if purchasing a sedan.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Never Again!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Have had nothing but issues. I take it in at least once a month to be fixed, mainly with Brakes and Power steering. Brakes replaced twice fixed four times. First set of brakes were replaced at 9,000 miles. Power steering sensor fixed once then replaced once because it would lock on me while Id drive. Feel very unsafe in this car. Dealership won't do anything for me. Trying to argue the MI Lemon Law with Pontiac Corp. Have also had issues with tire pressure. Let's just say, I will never get a GM again... doing everything I can to get out of this lease!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fell in love with this car from the day I saw it. I did hear many complaints regarding the sunroof and water leaking from it, so I decided to go for the 2008 Coupe GT model. I've had it for 1 month and totally love the way it drives. It has an amazing power and it's very appealing. I've had people come to ask me what kind of car it is. There're not too many G6 coupes here in FL, so it's head- turner everywhere I go. It motivates me to go anywhere!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Its style. Love that it was designed by 6 women so it DOES look like a girlie car. Femenine and sporty looking at the same time.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned many new cars (including many foreign makes) over the years including 3 previous Pontiacs with few issues. The difference between the G6 GT and the G6 GXP is night and day. This car has it all - power, comfort, style(Street Version), fun to drive, decent gas mileage, and so far very reliable. All this at a price with the GM and Dealer discounts well below similar offerings from Toyota, Honda, et al. Only concern is the perception that with GM dissolving Pontiac as a division the normal depreciation will accelerate greatly but as long as this car delivers I will have it a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I work for a company that has me on the road a lot, usually 50 - 75K a year. They let us choose what we want to drive, we buy it finance it and they give a very fair reimbursment for the miles. I bought the base GT with a few extras, keyless entry etc.. I have constantly gotten 32+ mpg on the highway with this car, I am also not afraid to pass with it. I have had ZERO problems with it. It had replaced a 2005 Elantra that was also a reliable car. This car "feels" safe you are fit and surrounded by its seat (I'm 6'1 and 190 lbs) I LOVE THE LOOKS, I LOVE THE FEEL (like a sports car) Plenty of back seat comfort (a note to GM) WHY KILL PONTIAC WHEN YOU FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT!!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My advice - don't fall for the fact its a convertible! I bought my car with only 3000 miles on it. I owned it for 6 months and called it quits. I would have paid for the dealer to take it back. I did love it when the top was down but that is all I can say that is positive. The car constantly pulled to the right. The hardtop constantly rattled when it was closed. The breaks didn't seem to want to stop and forget trying to drive it in the snow. It scared me to death. I had to get rid of it. I now own an eclipse again. I actually feel safe again. Is the car cute? Yes. Hot? Not hot enough to stress over daily. This is my opinion. Others seem to love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my G6 for under a year and am already having problems. At about 7500 miles I started noticing that the brakes were becoming comparable to those of my previous vehicle, which was 13 years old. About a month ago I noticed that it starts to shake and squeak when accelerating from a dead stop. I noticed earlier this week that when driving at around 30 mph there is a squeaking noise that sounds like it is coming from the engine compartment, or possibly the wheel bearings. I currently have about 12,000 miles on it and about 90 percent of those miles are highway driving miles. The car has ran well for me so far as the only problems have been noise and shaking. As well as brake wear.</TEXT>

<TEXT>i recently got my g6 after I turned 16, and it's been awesome to drive. The engine is peppy and quick. I'm 6'1 with long legs, and was skeptical about getting a coupe, but this car is very comfortable in the front and back. Extremely stylish exterior, i get compliments all the time. Just a few problems. Gas mileage kinda sucks, (18 mpg city). If you drive push the gas hard just one your whole tank of gas is gone. Often the air conditioning smells of coolant..? Also, back tires spin out very easily. Besides that, the car is awesome. Suspension is smooth and allows very quick and sharp turns easily.-- Beautiful Car</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is light years ahead of the Grand Prix we had. Handling, acceleration and great looks make this car very fun to drive. American cars have come a long way. The editors from this website don't give this car it's due. The dash could have a bit less plastic, but the design is very good. We don't have the hood scoop and the big spoiler (don't like the spoiler). But the front grill looks great. This car is a head turner and it doesn't look like the million Nissans, Hondas and Toyotas I see everyday.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this car over a Ford Mustang convertible because it was front wheel drive. Wasn't impressed with the acceleration, but this was after driving the Mustang. In the beginning I loved the car. The car looked great with the top down and even better with the top up. Sluggish and had too much pause between shifting. Horrible in snow, so ended up driving my truck all winter anyways. Now almost 8 months later I am in a rental car while I wait for my transmission to be fully rebuilt. The moldings around the seats are coming off for no reason. There is no where to put anything. Cup holders are in a bad place. Random rattles. More things, but running out of room. Should have bought the Ford.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks great, top up or down. Smooth ride & handles decent. The stereo system is awesome. I like the steering wheel controls. A lot of fun watching the top go up & down (like an episode of "Transformers"). Remote start. Warranty (tow truck guy was super nice when my transmission left me stranded).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love everything about this car! The ride is smooth and comfortable with plenty of power, zip, and pep. It's simply a blast to drive top up or top down. With the top up I've heard a few times, 'how is that a convertible'? I get fond looks and compliments from many folks with the top down. I enjoy driving it as well as being a passenger. Move the front seat a notch or two and I'm comfortable in the back seat and I'm 6'2". I know there's room for 4 adult sized adults in this car. No room in the trunk with the top down? So what, there's plenty of room in the back seat. Mustang can't say that!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The best way to review a car like this is to list the part that have been replaced at 14000 miles blower motor windshield air leek ONLY when its cold out (ice on the inside...took 20miles to melt) NOT Fixed by dealer Sunvisors will not retain position (If you have a 08 g6 take it in for this they stopped making the ones they put in the car because they are so bad ) Brakes and rotors Door made a noise when you stop. they just greased it. ( umm thanks GM ???) Engine ticks (when its cold) they did nothing to fix this. I was told they all do that.

<TEXT>Purchased this 08 g6 for my wife and it was a nightmare from the time we purchased it almost 2 years ago till we traded it in a few weeks ago. Premature brake failure on rotors and pads at 6000 miles, Pontiac says it was due to wife's poor driving habits and would not cover under warranty. Then the iceing on the cake was when the steering went out at 9,000 miles and I had had enough. If I had done my research on this car I would have seen that brake problems and steering failures are a common problem with the g6 and gm refuses to do anything about it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After buying a 2008 G6 GT (with the 3.5 L V6) I would not recommend this car. This is my 5th GM, 4th Pontiac. Seems the designers wanted to build a nice car, but fell short. By 18k miles the car: -Front suspension clunks -Steering clunks -Vibrates at highway speed -Idles rough -Heater smells of coolant (core leak?) -Transmission sometimes fails to shift (rare) -Tire pressure monitor cannot be set manually -Heat shields resonate -Brake pedal binds slightly -Steering column makes rubbing sound I made several trips to 2 dealerships. So far, most problems have been considered "normal" by GM dealerships and remain unresolved. Sadly, this is very likely my last GM.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car to replace my girlfriend's ailing 2004 Pontiac Grand Am V6 SE. She took a drive in a demo vehicle and loved it immediately. My dad bought an 06 new and has loved it so I thought it would be a good vehicle to try. We compared it online with all the other comparable cars in its class and enjoyed this one the most. She wanted a sunroof and 4cylinder for fuel economy so this fit the bill. The telescopic steering wheel, cockpit feel, good looks, and smooth handling sold it for her.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sunroof is great. One touch back and there is minimal road noise. Plus it looks great on the outside with it up. The suspension on this car is OUTSTANDING compared to past vehicles. The independent rear makes this car handle better than the smaller/lighter Cobalt/G5.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this V 6 car based on the reviews and must say that I am most disappointed in the quality. So far the vehicle has been to the dealer 3 times for brake squeal and now there are issues related to fit and finish that have to be dealt with. As an example, the front valance does not fit properly and the grill is warped. Vehicle gets very poor gas mileage and stalls when idling (another issue that the dealer has yet to fix). I will not be keeping this vehicle and will most likely return to a Toyota Camry. Sorry, but I gave GM a chance and they failed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Base G6 with V6 package, sun and sound, and convenience package. Overall I am happy with it. Owned for 15 months/28000 miles so far and only one problem -- steering gear was replaced after 3 months of ownership when it started leaking. Comfortable for long trips, plenty of power (low end torque), and low road noise. Engine is well muffled unless you open it way up. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>#1 feature: Torque on the V6. When it kicks down to pass (even just into the upper 2000's rpm range) you feel it. Also remote start, steering wheel controls, stereo aux input, extra power plug between seats in the console.</FAVORITE>

It's quiet, well mannered, V6 is responsive, great fuel economy at 27 avg city/highway. Car is solid with no rattles, no problems of any kind.

<TEXT>I've had a 1958 TR-3A, a 1972 MGB and a 1988 Chevy Cavalier Z24 convertible in my driving lifetime and this is the best overall package in the bunch. The only drawback is the tiny trunk when the hardtop is stowed, but, for heaven's sake, it IS a hardtop convertible! The thing must go somewhere! Fit and finish seems excellent. Several storage cubbyholes in the cockpit are very handy for stowage of manuals, remote controls and other "glove box" items. ONStar and XM radio are wonderful additions. The ac/heater vents have provided a perfect home for my Garmin GPS. We'll see how she likes the trip up to our condo in Flagstaff.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2.4 L engine should have an option of being supercharged, because the 2.4 L I4 is lacking power in a big way. At low rpm it drags until you reach around 4000 rpm then it seems to finally say " hey I'm at full throttle, let's go" but until then grandma in her wheel chair is passing you. They either need to increase power, have a power add-on option, or just get rid of the I4 all together.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is for most part great. The bolsters on the seats could be a little larger and give the lower back of the seat a small arch in it. The dead pedal definitely needs improvement.

<TEXT>I test drove all 4 of the reasonably- priced hard-top convertibles. Mazda was too small, Chrysler was not good, the Eos is worth a look but to get one with all the great features the G6 has would require spending about 3K more. I loved the G6 during the test drive but some of the negative comments I read in professional reviews were discouraging. After buying the car, I know those comments are unnecessarily over-critical. Comments on the lack of trunk space when the top is down are silly. It?s a ?hard-top?. Where else does one expect the roof to go? Many people have commented on the ?poor quality of interior material?. I don?t get it. The interior is just fine. I highly recommend this car</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The remote car starter is awesome. The red lighting to the instrument panel at night is very cool. It can get 31 mpg highway if you know how to drive. 6-disc CD player.

<TEXT>By far, G6 hardtop convertible is the best value in this segment. All expectations have been met or exceeded, & it has been relatively free of "surprises." Noticeable negative is interior plastics. GM really "stretched" to make this a truly affordable, modern 4-seat convertible, & for the most part, it succeeded. Top mechanism is unbelievably complicated, so an extended warranty is likely to be wise purchase. Power of 3.5L engine is fine, but occasionally feels sluggish at highway passing speeds. Surprisingly, fuel economy exceeds 17 city/26 hwy EPA estimates by 10 - 15%. Tranny is well-mated to engine. Wide turning radius, but otherwise handles well. And best of all, a rock-solid ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Originally I was interested in the 2008 Mazda 6, but was convinced by my wife to check out our GM discount. After being 2000 miles into driving my 2008 G6, I am completely satisfied. Not only did the G6 offer more features for the price, more incentives, and similar styling, the G6 performance (3.5 L V6) blows the Mazda 6 away! This is a crazy fun car to drive, with lots of "off the lot" performance and options to offer. I only wish I had purchased the GXP model for the body kit, sun and sound package for the moonroof, and leather for heated seats. GREAT VEHICLE!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car about 2 weeks ago, I find that I made a great choice, and I'm loving every minute of driving in it!. The pick up is a little slower than i thought but once it gets going, it holds you to the seat. Great for driving on the highway, not too bad fuel economy in the city. Very comfortable,and roomy. Quiet & smooth driving on the highway, and with over $7500.00 taken off the original price to make it $26,600 for the full SE package, i think i got a great price on it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently bought a 2008 Pontiac G6 GXP Coupe and it is an amazing car. The street edition kit makes the car look wonderful and everyone notices it. The car is very fun to drive and handles very well on the road. Bumps are barely noticeable. The interior feels great too. If I want the car to accelerate quickly, it launches. The power is great. My only concern with the car is that it seems like it wants to idle rough a little bit at times. I'm not worried the car will leave me stranded, but a brand new car shouldn't do that.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our G6 convertible in January 2008 and then patiently waited for warm weather to arrive. During that wait we found that the remote starter on our G6 works great from inside my office while the remote starter on my co-worker's BMW would not work from the same office. The car is a joy to drive with the top up or down. Many co- workers thought it was a sporty coupe until the top folded into the trunk. We are pleased with the gas mileage we have been getting. No long trips yet but around town mileage is averaging close to 20 MPG. The trunk is basically useless with the top folded down but we knew that when we purchased it. We are very happy with our Pontiac G6 convertible. Enjoy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am impressed with this car! My first American car. I came from an '06 Accord, though this car is not a Honda, it certainly upholds a good standard. I have all the options I could want, and could compare to the options of the VW Passat. Smooth ride, getting more smooth engine, not as refined as Accord. Interior is pretty nice. Great gas mileage, and finding this car to be a lot of fun!Its a happy car! Sporty looking! I got the fully loaded G6 with the 4cyl. I am really enjoying it, I miss my Accord, but this will be fun to drive! Killer for me is the resale value, but I think Pontiac is going in the right direction! Will I be back to Honda Acura, probably, but this is fun for now! Great car</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a sleek black beauty G6 GT Coupe about 2 weeks ago. I chose it over a accord coupe, altima coupe and a Mustang. This car is a head turner and is so fun to drive. Just took it on a trip to Florida and had so much fun driving it.If your looking for a nice sporty coup that avg. 31 mpg on my trip to Florida at 75mph. this is the car for you. I know I made the right decision. Also not many on the road like the other coupes. everyone loves it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded a 2004 Yukon for this vehicle and thus far it has been problem free. It feels sure footed and corners nicely with little lean. It has a bit more road noise in the cabin than I care for but it is not overly annoying. The 2.4 liter engine is peppy for it's size but no wheel spinner either. Gas mileage has been fairly good at near 22 around town and running slightly above 30 mpg on the highway. Rear seat room is above average and comfort. All in all I consider it a good buy with the c/d player radio and ON Star. I'd buy another one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a total let down. Interior could not be any cheaper. Other than the cheap cloth (?) seats everything seems to be hard plastic. Now that the weather is warming up the inside has a awful plastic smell. The fuel mileage is terrible. We had to have the tie rods replaced in less than 2000 miles. Car hesitates while driving, lack of useful accessories, and very cheap paint job. We hate this new car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this 08 g6 back in sept, 2007. At about 9,000 miles the steering system broke and needed to be replaced. Then the brake rotors began to warp shortly afterwards. Service adviser told me that these are some of the common problems with the g6 and Pontiac has no plans to fix or remedy the problem. I traded in the g6 a few months ago for a Honda Civic. Thank you Honda. Buyer beware! Avoid the g6 at all costs!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car for the price point. I compared it to a Ford Fusion, Honda Accord, Dodge Avenger, and a Prius. This is the one that both myself and husband felt the most comfortable in both in the front seat and as back seat passengers. The trunk space with the fold down seats that do not cover your floorspace in the back is a nice feature. It is a sedan that truly drives like a sports car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth transmission, great pickup when you need it, easy to find everything with a true cockpit feel. Fuel economy is great on the freeway, and needs a bit more improvement in city driving. There is more than enough leg room in the back seat for full size passengers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall, this is a great car. The Street Edition package turns heads. The ground effects kit and the scoops in the hood are gorgeous. The hammerhead spoiler is a little much, but it is starting to grow on me as time goes on. The car has plenty of power and pickup, especially since it is such a small car. I also only get about 17 mpg average between street and highway driving. I blame it mostly on low speed limits in the city I live in. On a road trip, I maintained over 25 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall a nice car; comfortable, decent pick-up for a 4 cyl car, and nice radio with mp3 jack. I think that the exterior makes the car look more expensive than it is. My big problems with this car is the lack of keyless entry and the fuel economy. There is only one keyhole on the drivers door and it only unlocks that door-a big pain with full hands. Also I only get about 21mpg which is a big let down to me. I feel like I'm filling up all the time. I'm glad it's a lease. I miss my 06 Hyundai Elantra; it was cheaper had keyless entry and much better fuel economy. My advice - check other cars in this price range before buying, you may feel that you get more for your money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A beautiful car inside and out. It feels like driving a more expensive car. The power adjustable pedals and seat make for a perfect fit. I purchases the optional 18" wheels with stability control(only $390 sticker for all)and am surprised at how aggressively the car corners. Most of my time is spent driving sedately and the quiet ride with Monsoon system have made me enjoy driving again. I find myself using the heated leather seats on warm days to help my lower back. The headliner is nicely cushioned, and the two-tone interior is very visually appealing. I look forward to the drive every time I get in this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased for $12,000 (Thanks, GM Card dollars!). At that price nothing really competes. I was able to get the dealer to add cruise, and for those that really want remote locks that can be added as well. Note the gas mileage will be less if the car has the 3.91 axle ratio, but will have more pep. So if you are shooting for 30 MPG be aware of the "optional" axle ratio issue. Easy to drive, but a little hard to get in and out of as doors are narrow top to bottom. I do 90% highway cruising, and this is quite and very smooth for its size. I understand wiper blades are expensive, so try and get covered under bumper-to- bumper warranty. Also, no key hole on passenger door, seems odd.</TEXT>

I have a beautiful, bright white exterior with a two-tone black and tan interior and I couldn't have picked a better looking combination. I have never had a 4cyl engine before and it has plenty of pickup and power. The only thing I have noticed is a slight driver side window whistle on the highway. Other than that, this car is prefect. The 4- and 5- star crash ratings make this a great buy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am totally impressed with my 2008 G6 value line. The 2.4L is powerful, quiet and responsive. The 4 speed transmission is excellent. I was swayed by negative reviews about the electronic power steering but after driving the G6, I actually prefer electronic assist. Turning radius is great. I also like the large diameter steering wheel. I bought the tan interior and like the bright appearance over the black interior. Seating is comfortable and the car is quiet and fun to drive. It is a fun car to drive and feels safe and secure. I also test drove the Honda Civic and Accord, and Toyota Camry and completely prefer the G6.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powerful and quiet 2.4L 4 cylinder engine had the power and performance of a small V6. Ride and handling is excellent and performance oriented.

<TEXT>I was looking for a coupe so I checked out Nissan, Honda and Toyota. They all were ok but something just didn't feel right with any of them. I was driving past a Pontiac dealer and spotted the G6 coupe and it was love at first sight. It had everything I was looking for and more. Once I took a test drive and talked price I was sold. I paid $8-10,000 LESS than I would have paid for the Nissan, Honda or Toyota. Once I started driving it and checked my gas mpg I couldn't believe it. On the highway I'm getting 28-30 mpg and city is 23-25 mpg and it isn't even broken in yet!! As a added benefit the car is made in the USA, it looks like American workers can do a good job too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When i saw the commercial announcing the 08 G6 GXP street edition, I knew I had to have one. One week later she was sitting in my garage. I never expected all that she gives. performance is great, from the 3.6vvt,the six speed automatic, and 2.77 gear ratio. Quick as a house cat out of the hole and cruises at less than 2000r's. She feels very nimble cornering and goes great in the snow. I find the seats very comfortable and all controls to be where they should. everywhere I go someone will come up and ask "what is it?" Pontiac has definetly hit a homerun in my opinion. Looks, style, performance (she's not a race car but a great commuter), and fuel mileage for the 21st century. </TEXT>

<TEXT>For the last 3 years I've been driving around in my Mini Cooper convertible. It was a fun little car to drive but not much pickup or interior space. It was the first convertible I've ever owned. The G6 caught my eye it has 3 packages available, Premium, Sports and chrome (though a lot of the stuff seems to overlap). After test driving it, I was hooked, its still the winter so I'm sure many dealers aren't selling convertibles right now, but having a hardtop you just feel like your driving a regular car, its not as noisy, or cold as a soft top. I can't wait till the summer so I can enjoy this car to the max. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, a great car. In the handling departement, it competes well with Japanese models. It doesn't compete with the German cars, but it's a lot less expensive, and sportier looking to boot. Anyone looking for a convertable would do well to consider the G-6. The seats are comforable and well designed. The lack of a power recline feature on the power seats can be overlooked. The height of the arm rests are perfect. So far, we havn't had any probles with this car. This car looks and feels great. Some one else mentioned last year that college girls love this car. It's true. Just trust me on this. If you're a single 20 or 30 something guy and can afford it, buy this car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The folding hardtop convertable roof, of course. I also like the red lighting of the instrument panel. The car is comfortable and sporty. Handling is well controlled and the car is fun to drive. We really like this car a lot. </FAVORITE>

It's so much fun to drive, it's very sporty and looks awesome with the top up or down! I get looks, honks and thumbs up from everyone!

<TEXT>I really got into the car buying process this time. I compared this car to the Toyota Corolla and Camry, Honda Accord, and Nissan Altima. This car list at 18,875 and is very well equipped at this price: Several thousand less than Altima, Camry, and Accord. It has a smooth, responsive feel and compared to the others cars I test drove much more pep! Hands down this car out performs any foreign car in its class that is price even 2,000 to 3,000 dollars more. Not to mention the the 2,000 dollar rebate that GM was offering, the additional 1,000 loyality cash (since I have a 1999 pickup). Final price 15,400 compared to 19,000 plus for Accord, Camry, or Altima. Time to buy American.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is simply fun to drive, for a four cylinder it is very peppy, passes great, sound system is awesome, runs quiet, and the ride is smooth and responsive.
