<TEXT>I loved the car when I first bought it, since I worked for Vw at the time. It handles great and has great throttle response. The color of the gauges at night are super cool. I like the ease of controls from the steering wheel instead of having to fiddle with the main controls. One thing that has bothered me is 8 months ago from July 1st 2009, is that it started having problems. Tonight while coming from work the display said stop engine, oil pressure etc. For an 08 GLI w/ 30K thats awful. Make sure you check you oil people. I drive only 5K per oil change as told to and Somehow I'm on the minimum part of dipstick!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Fun fun to drive ! Solidly built car. Plenty of trunk space. ESP system helps on off ramp bursts. Traction control works like it should in snow.It corners on rails. I'm a little heavy on the foot and I still get 27 mpg.Very quiet engine to a point you'll forget you have 6 speeds . Kelly book also rated it as one of the highest resale value. Oh and it should come with speeding tickets included </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style, comfort,and great on gas even when your speeding along. Very well built.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I don't think you can buy a car this good for the price. VW did a great job tuning the power band on this car. I also got the newest 2.0 CCTA TSI engine which is featured in the late 2008 GLI and the 2009 Jetta 2.0T models. This engine has the timing chain, rather than a belt, and a few other upgrades to the engine.This car is safe, powerful, handles well, comfortable, looks good, luxurious enough, and has a huge trunk. My family member used to own a 3 series BMW and this car is just is good for about $15,000 less. If you want to be the person who says "look at me"! and overpay just for a nameplate, get a BMW. If you want a great all around sports sedan and pay a lot less, check out the GLI</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>-Turbo engine w/great power band -Momo steering wheel -Supportive sport bucket seats -Heated seats -Premium sound system -6 airbags -VW sport-tuned Handling -Bi-xenon Headlights -The biggest trunk you may ever see on a sports sedan</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Awesome car and when you figure in the price it's a slam dunk. Nothing comes close for the money and the gas mileage is insane in relationship to power. This is what you need when gas is 4 bucks a gallon but still want luxury and performance and space.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive my car everyday. City mileage I get about 24.4 and city averaging 35.5 doing 70 mph. I like how the car just with the tap of the throttle likes to take off. It has great handling, very little under/over steer. The ESP option is great for dirt and gravel roads, helps with sticking to the road. Since New Years Eve of 2008 I have put al ot of miles on the car. It has held up with no problem and does extremely well on the highway. Gas mileage isn't what I'm used to from my last car I owned. Yet the car gets compliments often and will be with me for a long time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features would be the ESP control button. When winter comes around, turn it off and let the car loose in a parking lot. The 4 wheel disc brakes work wonders for though that like the track. I do like the DRL lights, they seem to provide a little more safety to the car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just picked up my new Platinum Gray GLI . Paid 25,850 plus tax for auto moon cold weather and all season mats . But mostly took advantage of the new VW 48 months at 0% financing. Anyway just hope anyone else can comment with moonroof open it sounds like a train on my hood. Is anyone experience this loud vibration. Whew. Didn't open moonroof during test drive due to hot during the day. LOL.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the night lights in the car also the intralagos cloth seats are cool. Mileage I hope will live up to expectations. Sirius, and tilt telescoping steering wheel. Also salesman pointed out the auto opening and closing of Windows with the key in the outside lock.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is an absolute blast to drive! I drive with a very heavy foot and still average 23-25 MPG (premium 93 gasoline). I'm 6'5" and weigh 220 lbs, yet I have plenty of leg room. The adjustable seat height is probably one of my favorite features. My wife enjoys the feel of an SUV so she raises the seat all the way up when she drives and says it gives her a feeling of being higher up than a typical sedan. The steering is extremely responsive even under heavy acceleration. If you are unfamiliar with turbo's, there is a bit of lag noticeable when letting off the brake from a complete stop. It's a normal function of any turbo and just takes some getting used to. Love the car! Highly recommend!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bi-Xenon headlights, paddle shifters on the steering wheel (DSG package), enormous trunk, electronic speed sensitive steering, 18" rims are beautiful, great acceleration from stand still and on freeway, car key folds into remote, wrap around air curtain, plaid seats, overall performance of turbo</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my car about 2 months ago - I couldn't be happier. The DSG is a blast. I also like the sound of the engine when in Sport mode... I was comparing the Subaru WRX and the GLI for quite a while. The only advantage of the WRX is the AWD. Everything else is better in the GLI. The biggest difference is the interior - the WRX looks like a Toys?R?us car inside. Plus GLI has wider rubber and much nicer rims, cleaner and nicer exterior look and I also got a decent deal on it. I like driving it hard on curvy roads - it has lots of grip and I am having a blast. Is the first car I've had that after two months I still can't wait to get behind the wheel.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased my Black 6-speed manual GLI starting in March and absolutely love the car. I really wanted a GTI, but the dealer didn't have any, and the test drive of the GLI sold me. The engine is perfect for this car, and the gas mileage is surprisingly good considering the power the engine has (26-27 mpg for the first 1000 miles). The steering and handling feel tight, and the ride is very well controlled. Coming from a Honda, the VW's interior is worlds superior in terms of amenities and build quality. The interior lighting, interlagos cloth seats, HID headlights, red break calipers, 8-way adjustable seats and their comfort and details that really set this car apart. Recommended!</TEXT>

<TEXT>For six months I shopped, researched, test drove many cars. I was leaning towards an Audi A4 with an S Package but decided to check out the vdubs too. It's a true German car with all it's high quality materials and engineering. The frame is solid steel and when you open and close the door you can feel its a well built car and not a Japanese thin framed vehicle. The GLI comes with a turbo engine, a DSG dual clutch transmission that can shift faster than any human. The sport's suspension and the Pirelli tires make the GLI handle nicely. I ended up purchasing the GLI two months ago and have no regrets. It handles like the Audi A4 but $10,000 cheaper and better on the pocket book.</TEXT>

<TEXT>While walking down the lot I noticed the GLI, test drove it and fell in love with the car and how it handled. WOW! This car is amazing. It's a true German car with all its high quality materials and engineering. The frame is solid steel and when you open and close the door you can feel it's a well built car and not a Japanese thin framed vehicle. The GLI comes with a four cylinder turbo engine, a DSG dual clutch transmission that can shift faster than any human. The sports suspension and the Pirelli tires allow the GLI to handle very much like a sports sedan which I was very impressed. I ended up purchasing the GLI since it was $10,000 cheaper than the Audi and handled better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I picked up my Black 08' GLI with manual transmission and the autobahn package this weekend and it has been a dream come true. The quality of this automobile is outstanding and you feel it the moment you shut the door. The engine is responsive and quick and the steering is sharp and precise. The fit and finish are outstanding. The stereo and displays are loud and clear. I had to travel to get my car and the 350 mile drive home was heaven and I even got 29 miles per gallon to boot! If you want the best Germany can offer for much less than a BMW, this is your car. You will not be disappointed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've mainly purchased BMWs and Audis, probably a good reason for that. My wife and I test drove the 08 GLI 4dr with DSG. Transmission was fairly jumpy in my mind, breaks were not as solid, and the handling was very loose. Of course I'm coming from a 06 325i and comparing it to this VW. In my mind it isn't as sporty as some people think it is or handles as well. A vehicle that compares well to BMW that is not an Audi or Mercedes, is the 08 Mini Cooper S AM. I was very impressed with this vehicle and probably will purchase one. And I know that VW makes Audi and etc. But transmissions are different, i don't think the DSG compares well enough to Audi's tiptronic nor BWM's SMG. Sorry.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased the VW GLI 08 and drove it everyday for 3 weeks now. This is my first German car coming from Japanese cars. So far, I love this car with its 200HP turbo engine; nice interior, 10 speaker premium sound system, sirius radio, and cool 18" wheels. This is also my first to drive a sports sedan with stiffer suspension where you really feel the road imperfections. I guess they will have to do a better job fixing the roads.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 00 VW GTI VR6, and this GLI in my opinion captures the essence of that car, and builds upon what it did right. The exterior of the "jetta" is not my favorite, but this GLI has enough touches to make it sharp. This is a practical sedan that screams to be driven. I owned an 04 BMW 330i with lim. ed. perform package, this is essentially what this VW offers, and a far greater value. To have power to go, but still get great gas mileage is huge in today's economy. The dsg transmission is phenomenal. I'm still breaking mine in, but the speed of shifts is like driving an arcade video game car! My wife was not happy about the purchase, until she saw it and drove it for the first time! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I could not be more satisfied with my 2008 GLI, it has met or exceeded all my expectations of it thus far. I had a small issue with some interior bits (all cosmetic), but that was quickly fixed by the dealership, so it was never a problem. I've put about 4,000 miles on the beast in 2.5 months, and the only way I can describe the experience is that I look forward to, and find excuses for driving. This car is a great bargain with minimal equipment added, but even fully loaded (just under 30k or so) it's a steal. If you are looking at similar-sized sport sedans, then make sure you take a test-drive in the GLI, you WILL be converted.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>"Steering wheel of the gods," as C&D put it; AMAZING DSG gearbox (automated manual option); 18" wheels (definitely worth the coin, and TURNS heads); great fuel economy on highway trips (30mpg+!); sport seats; large trunk area; firm sport suspension</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have driven my 2008 GLI just over 5000 miles, including just over 3000 from Atlanta to San Francisco. It hasn't used any oil and I was averaged 25.75 mpg with both city and highway driving. It is more comfortable than the '07 that I had and it is so great to have the cruise control back on the turn signal stalk. I do miss the dual zone Climatronic, but I was easily able to stay comfortable during my drive. The seats are supportive enough that I never really tired even after one day of being in it for almost 14 hours straight. I couldn't believe that I was not more fatigued after that. It is fast, fun and I think pretty economical on gas. It is a real winner!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was sketchy about buying a VW, especially after owning a Honda for 8 trouble-free years. Despite my skepticism, I decided to take the plunge and I have been pleasently surprised. There have been no major issues to report after two months and 1700 miles of service. Gas mileage can be between low 20s to low 30s depending on how you drive it. The turbo 4 easily out-accelerates many cars on the road, and the car is assembled with good quality materials. Aside from some minor buzzes from some interior bits, my car has not consumed any oil, does not shake or stall. The car has been reliable so far (knock on wood), but then again I haven't abused it. Take care of it and it'll take care of you.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plaid seats, smooth shifting 6-speed manual, great highway mileage, moonroof, zoom of the 2.0 FSI Turbo, 18" Huffeisen rims + platinum grey looks amazing (much nicer than stock Jetta).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having owned a myriad of sport sedans, many costing tens of thousands more than this vehicle, I am more than impressed with this car. Excellent performance, including acceleration, braking and handling and the best steering of any car I have ever driven make this VW truly exceptional. It could easily sell for $10K more than the sticker and it would still be worth it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2008 GLI after one month of service has been expectedly reliable and pleasant. So far my GLI does not burn oil, is not loud at start-up and does not shake/shimmy exhibit any other cause of concern that other VW owners have complained about. I drove my VW very gently for the break in period (yes, less than a month and i'm well over 1k miles) and followed all directions in the owners manual. I rarely punched it and everything is as expected. The interior does show lint little scuffs, but these are easy clean ups considering how beautiful the interior is. It averages 24mpg overall , and supposed to get better with age. No problems, and utter Farfeghnughen. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just came out of a 2006 GTI, 2-door into the 2008 GLI. The two extra doors are handy, so is the large trunk. So far I have absolutely no complaints. If you can spare the cash, the 18" all season performance tires are a must, as they add a nice touch to this car. Comparing it to earlier MKVs, I like the lower suspension, but it would have been nice if they kept the headlight pressure washers, the climate control, and the split front airvent knob.</TEXT>
