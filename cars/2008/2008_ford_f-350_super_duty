<TEXT>i have 7000 miles on the 6.4. it has lots of power. anyone that owns one get a 4 inch ext. tuner and you will not have any problems. the reason some are is that these engines r so restricted back because of the govt these engines need to breath just like us and their not letting them. dont believe me go buy a 08 dodge cummins its having the same problems. so its not ford dodge or chevy. these engines produce so much horse power and torque that with resrtictions its hurting more than helping. so what im saying is help out your engines.. i deal w them everyday look at the engine prior to 2003 and they all era great thats because govt. wasnt involved</TEXT>

<TEXT> Fuel mileage 7-9 mpg no matter if loaded or not. Most of my driving is short trips 5-10 miles town and country mix. I even drove it to California thinking the open road would help... Best avg was 12.5 mpg on 1000 miles of flat driving with no load. Factory tires were garbage they wore out at 14,000 miles good job Ford. They replaced my radiator at 3000 miles. This is my $50,000 truck. I have owned and bought 5 new Ford super doodies since the new body style and this motor is crap because of the mileage and the truck rides too stiff. The exhaust cleaner is ridiculous. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I want to fist say that I have the King Ranch and it has the most amazing leather package that I have ever seen! Next, it is not entirely Ford's fault regarding fuel economy. In 2008, the EPA mandated DPF filters on all diesel trucks resulting in horrible fuel economy. The radiator issue is a recall, and I had mine replaced at 35k -- since then I had no problems. Towing: I tow a 38ft 12k fifth wheel and live in Colorado (high altitude). The DPF while in regen will increase EGTs resulting in the turbo fans to go off and sometimes resulting in the truck going into limp mode. I find this to be this trucks serious flaw. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Quieter than my 6.0, but seems to have less torque, fuel mileage is 1-2MPG less than my 6.0, has plenty of power to pull 39' horse trailer and hauling 15 rolls of hay, seats are still not comfortable and have been since 2002 models, sides of front seats push in at the hips and cause discomfort after a few hours of driving, Ford still needs to redesign front seats, vibrates at take off, worse when pulling loads, bumpers are the pits any more on new trucks, they are nothing more than cosmetic like car bumpers, Factort Continental brand tires stink, rubber gets gummy and peals in hot road conditions, they are worn out by 30,000 miles, Ford can do better on a 50,000 truck. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So far no issues. One long haul over many passes and headwinds, the trans is killer compared to My old 97 Power Stroke there is nothing I miss about the old truck. Quiet &comfortable. This truck laughs at climbs and head wind. Mileage increased from 12.8 to 16.1 driving to work after the towing workout. Continental tires wear is not good. Ford needs to work on that part. 18 inchers are not cheap. Re-gen has been occuring at a pretty steady 350 mile interval. Most of my driving is highway. with little stop and go driving. WE are very happy with the truck. this is Ford Diesel #3 for us.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2nd Review, Now have 49000 miles on truck. For the first year only in the shop 13 times. 2 Radiators, Turbo controller, P/S idler pulley, A/C repair, Still smimmys when starting from stop. Trans now and again down shifts hard like I got rear ended. Dealer says no problem found. Goes into regen 3 to 5 times a day, sucks fuel while in regen. Dealer says, That is normal. Before computer up date, maybe regens 3 times a week. The truck has power, I am afraid to take off road. Will the radiator leak? Will I start a desert fire from the regen? Will I have to walk 60 miles because the truck broke down? My 2000 Ford f250 4X4 7.3L,(bought new), 268,000 miles in the shop 4 times. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have now had 5 Ford F-250 or Ford F- 350 diesel trucks. I tow trailers and use my trucks for work everyday. I have loved all of my Ford trucks until this 2008. This truck is junk. The 2005 Ford F-350 was one of the best trucks I have ever owned. It had tremendous power and fuel mileage pulling my 48' trailer the way I drive at around 11 mpg. The 2008 model gets 5.9 mpg. I have had 2 radiators replaced. The exhaust system has had numerous repairs with most dealers not knowing what to do. It repeating will go into exhaust clean at idle with my foot on the brake and will lurch forward. Ford continues to tell me it will not do this. I have discussed this problem with Ford, I am tired of Ford.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Checked with Edmunds.com and found multiple people with radiator issues. Within one year 2 recalls, (one with the radiator) now they tell me thousands to replace it, not covered by agreement. We had work done months ago they charged us for and when we called Ford found out it was covered and was issued a check. Not feeling warm and fuzzy with you people. Not getting lots of answers from the dealer either. Seems strange with a radiator recall, now we have to replace it. Not happy at all</TEXT>

<TEXT>I own a 08' Lariat dually crewcab one ton. I've owned sevral 3/4 tons (7.3's) in the past and yes they did get better mpg. 18 to 22 vs. 12.5 to 14. My truck has just turned 20k and is setup to pull (4.10 rears Vs. 3.73's). I knew what I was getting into, this truck is great, my wife loves to drive it. It's easy to turn and park. I had an aftermarket air filter on it. But after hearing too many scary stories about turbos being destroyed along with the engine, I went back to stock air box and filter. Mileage and HP have not been affected. So for sake of your $7500 engine and voiding any warranties don't mess with perfection. On a trip at 75 mph unloaded I averaged 11.6. Back (3.5 ton)11.8.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The truck is great for sure. I have owned Ford super duty truck since they started. This 2008 is all around best ford F-350 out there, but I have 8k miles on it now and tody is the 1st time i pulled my 40 fifth wheel. The MPG stinks. I got 7.8 at 65mph. Yes I have the 4.10 rear end. I think as soon as my warranty is up I will pull the exhaust system out and change it. I have been told this will make about a 40% better mpg. When I drive the truck without pulling anything it gets 12.2 mpg at 70, 13.8 at 65 mph, 16.0 at 55mph. I know I bought the truck to haul and yes that part is perfect. My last 350 got 17 mpg at 80 mph, pulling a 40 trailer I got 10.4. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have just purchased this vehicle. Performance is excellent and ride is great. I know that people are concerned about the fuel economy. This truck is a job build #3. I would have to tell anyone that is looking for reasonable fuel economy and need a truck, this Ford will do the job. I have the diesel with the 3.55 rear end. I only have 1000 miles of use but I was able to get 19.3 MPG driving 60 MPH. Remember the diesel will show a MPG improvement after about 10K. The Super Duty will make a excellent truck for anyone needing a truck for work. I also believe those getting bad MPG are running 4.10 gears and also drive just to fast to maximize MPG. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first diesel truck and upgraded from an F150. This truck has tremendous power and towing ability and looks the part. Just got back from an extended trip towing a 10,000 lb trailer in the mountains with an 800 lb motorcycle in the bed and the truck did great even after obliterating a deer at 60 mph. I did develop a funning turbo noise under extreme load and high rpm towing which is a concern, but have not had any other problems. Mileage under load varies from 7.5 to 10 mpg depending on wind and speed, but unloaded I have gotten up to 19 mpg at 70 mph which is better than my F150. It took about 5000 miles to get to that mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned a lot of trucks over the years as third vehicles and primarily use them for light recreational hauling, hunting, etc. My previous two trucks were 2004 and 2005 F150's. Both were impressive trucks,however,my early impression of the F350 is that it's in an entirely different league. It rides like an F150,would likely beat the F150 in a drag race,is quiet and civilized yet pulls like a beast. I'm still on my "new truck honeymoon" but must say this F350 has captured my heart in the early going and I'm not easily impressed. Admittedly, I go through a lot of vehicles but my intention is to drive this beauty 4 or 5 years. No load combo driving mpg is right at 14...hope it improves. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great truck so far! The mpg could always be better but it's new and diesels need time to break in and get better mileage.(about 12.5mpg with 2000 miles on the truck) Haven't had any blue smoke like I read from others, also with the new emission regulations the Cummins and the Duramax aren't getting much better mpg compared to the Ford, so blame Washington for that! I pull a 14,000 gvw gooseneck dump trailer and this truck handles it loaded with ease! Like I said this truck is new, with a brand new diesel. I have faith Ford learned it's lesson with the 6.0 and will not shoot itself in the foot with this new 6.4! </TEXT>

Dealer replace ECG, radiator to no avail. It's still at the dealership for same work. We filed for Lemon Law buy-back but Ford refused. Case in pending right now. Buyer Beware.....

<TEXT>I have owned several Ford trucks, and they have all been solid workhorses. My new F350 DRW with the optional 6.4 diesel appears to be of the same cut of cloth. So far, it has met every work task with ease. It rides like a half-ton SUV, pulls like a locomotive and has the looks to turn heads. Some new owners complain about fuel consumption. Granted, it would be great to have all this ability, plus 25 MPG, but that's not what these trucks are designed for. They are built to pull heavy loads, and you have to pay a price for that. Would you expect a draft horse to consume the same amount of feed as a burro? If you need a truck for heavy towing, I suggest you strongly consider the F350.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The new diesel is exceptionally quiet, with no smoke and no odor. It's a great looking truck that rides and drives extremely well. The King Ranch and Navigation system options were well worth the price. The tow command and tow boss options make towing big loads a snap.</FAVORITE>

The power is amazing, the engine is deadly silent and it handles like a 1/2 ton! I plan to pull around 17,000#'s with a 5th wheel in the future, but for now it pulls around my 7,000# boat like it's not even there. The interior is by far the nicest I have ever seen in a truck.

<TEXT>I had to wait over 3 months to take delivery of my "King Ranch", and it was well worth it! It has a sleek interior, smooth ride, and a powertrain that refuses to quit! Pulling a trailer seems effortless and still delivers a great ride. The 6.4L diesel is not only quiet enough to pull through a fast food line without turning off the engine, you can actually travel down the road without raising your voice to talk to your passengers. Not all trucks are able to claim that. Ford has succeeded with a very stylish and impressive truck!</TEXT>

<TEXT>In my 1 week of ownership I have found my new F350 Diesel to be a great vehicle: fast off the mark, looks good, and decent economy for such a large vehicle. The interior seems to have a solid and upmarket feel - no cheap jiggly plastic, or rattles. In a word: car-like. My usage involves light towing, lumber yards, 5 passenger trips, and also some commuting when the car is in for service. This vehicle is huge, but comfy enough to be driven anywhere. Ford had to get this revision of the F series perfect, and I think they have very nearly succeeded. It is a large improvement over my 2003 F250 - which was 2 generations of truck ago in the Ford Super Duty line. I might ditch the car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this truck! It is the first diesel I have owned. Takes some getting used to. Honestly Ford wasn't even on my list. Their build quality in the past left something to be desired. I have to say the fit and finish is perfect. The interior materials lost that "plastic" feel. This cab feels luxurious. The diesel pulls right out, you can really feel the torque. My purchase was intended to pull a fifth wheel but haven't purchased that yet so no info on the towability. The crew cab is awesome, it holds all my tools previously kept in the bed of my Chevy. Turning radius is great, U-turns are no problem. That was unexpected but welcome.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Not just one, I like the folding rear seats, the interior is comfortable, the diesel is quiet enough to have a conversation. The new front end looks really cool and also allows all radiators to breathe. My first tank averaged 17mpg and will probably get better.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I ordered my 2008 F350 SRW Super Duty back in October with the 6.4 L twin turbo diesel engine, 5speed auto in a crew cab with 4X4 and a long bed. I took delivery on February 13th and have loved driving this monster ever since. The interior looks like an F-150 but is unique to the Super Duty line. The leather seats are the most comfortable in any heavy pick-up but the quiet diesel with jet like thrust is what Ford got right. I don't have to shut down the engine to order at the drive through (not possible with a Dodge/Cummins) and acceleration is a silent, progressive shove in the back without any turbo lag or whine. This truck rides like a half ton, goes like sports car, and tows like a Peterbuilt.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My wife does not complain when I want to take the truck up to Los Angeles because the quiet ride, soft seats and creature comforts like dual zone climate controls with rear DVD player for the kids. Cab is like a luxury sedan but I can load 4K lbs. in the bed and still tow 12K lbs. Simply awesome.</FAVORITE>
