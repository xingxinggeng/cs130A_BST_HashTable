<TEXT>When you buy a C 300,or a 328, or A4, you're buying a good German engineered automobile that delivers sporty and capable driving dynamics without being a performance car, enough features to please most drivers but no luxury amenities (unless you add optionals that will shoot up the price), and comprehensive maintenance/service (every 10k miles or so). It's a very good car that makes me look forward to the E550 or E63 AMG. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Design, cruise control, stereo, handling, pretty good all around.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was cross-shopping BMW 335i and Audi S4. When I drove the C350, I knew this was the car for me. Sure, it's not as fast as either the 335 or S4 but overall it is perfect. Mine has the P2 package, Multimedia package, Panarama sunroof, 18" rims and iPod adapter. There are more audio storage options than I could probably ever fill. The stereo is great and the build quality is fantastic. I love driving this car and everything about it. I have no regrets and do not miss having a BMW. I will keep this car for a long time. Drive it, you won't be disappointed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Multimedia package - love the navigation, Harmon Kardon stereo and the ability to rip CDs to the hard drive. I could spend all day listening to music in the car. The iPod adapter is great too because I can scroll through all my playlists and songs by name.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have to say that I didn't know what to expect, but I am so pleased that I chose a Mercedes this time around. I normally drive Nissan Maxima but have been very displeased with its stability and maneuverability (drove like truck!!). I heard how fun it was to drive a C-Class so I test drove the 2008 when they came out and was blown away. Great pickup and the steering is awesome. I'm a bit of a "speedaholic" so this car works for me for its safety features as well. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My model came with the entertainment package and completely loaded. What can I say but that you are really missing out if you don't include the great technology offered...DVD... upgraded speakers, iPod integration...etc...</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the 1st car I purchased for myself. I can truly call it my own. It was the first of the small luxury sedans I test drove and none of the others could live up to the MB C300. It is a gorgeous car both inside and out. Had MB not redesigned, it would not have even been a consideration. I'd be driving a Lexus right now. The car is gorgeous, has been reliable for me and the service at my dealership is beyond excellent. I only have good things to say! Nothing says class, luxury and comfort like a Mercedes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Panorama roof. Sound system. The way the screen pops out of the dash. Easy to use buttons and clean looking interior (the Audi A4 had wayyy too many buttons). It's an extremely comfortable drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looks, looks, looks. That's what the new C350 has going for it. I love the AMG styling, handling, and sportiness. Sometimes the suspension beats you up on PA potholes, but I'm used to driving a heavier car. It's lightening fast too. MPG is a bit low for a car, but performance makes up for it. Wish the interior was just a bit more posh vs. functional, but the new NAV is leaps and bounds ahead of old MB designs. Overall, I would recommend this car. It's a Mercedes, and surprisingly affordable vs the competition!! Go for it. Palladium Silver is a beautiful color. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>New NAV system, Looks in Sport/AMG wheel trim, Color Palladium Silver, Polished Aluminum wheels resist black brake dust vs. the other silver painted wheels that scar easily with the dust buildup. Wood is much better looking than Alum trim in C300 Sport. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have driven several luxury sedans and SUVs. If you are in the market to buy a high-bred, trust me when I say that this is not a luxury car. It is peppy enough considering what it is. It feels like nothing more than a VW Jetta. The interior is very plain and honestly kind of feels cheap. There is literally what looks and feels like aluminum on the doors and dash. Yes I understand that for 30K you can't expect to get much from MBenz. The car is cute and most likely reliable in the long term, but that's about it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Like every few years, it was time for me to upgrade my ride to the newest 330Ci BMW. (20 year 3 series BMW driver) Not this time After I hear the price and did a over all comparo with my new C350 MB; I can tell you guys that I made one of the best choices of my life. I am not even looking back. My MB gives me so much more features and options that would be extra in a BMW. Performance is not bad at all either Also, my experience at the MB dealership was so much better than at the new Snobby BMW dealer here in big D. I still can't believe I am writing a review praising the goodness of my former rival. I am so glad that I finally found "The Ultimate Driving Machine" after 20 years. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am approaching my one year anniversary and love the car. I liked the interior of the luxury model so I bought it and the dealer installed a sports grille (the cost was nominal as the grilles are interchangable). I have had no problems at all. I have 4- matic and the car runs like a tank through the snow. The media center is easy to use and the premium sound is great. The Bluetooth was not compatible with my LG phone so had to buy a Motorola. The seats are comfortable and the MB Tek looks like real leather. A great car for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my C300 Luxury. However, I purchased the multimedia package and iPod interface. I sadly discovered the iPod cannot be controlled using the COMAND system and display on the popup screen. Instead you must use steering wheel controls. For a large music collection, this is completely cumbersome at the least, and it renders the multimedia COMAND controls completely useless. It would be easier to use a traditional patch cable and plug the iPod in to the AUX jack in the glovebox. This is really a bad design, and I would think a car stickering at 40K+ would do a better job. This is my only beef with my new car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cruise control, overall COMAND function is great - NAV, Sirius radio, 6 CD changer, internal hard drive and memory card, as well as bluetooth phone control are great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is for 2008 MB C300 Luxury. I traded in my wife's 2006 BMW 325 (I am glad I got rid of that disappointing car. So noisy my god the chevy 2500 diesel was quiter - no kidding). Love this C class though. Smooth, quite and fast enough for me (I am mid 40s). It does everything in Merced way. I owned the previous C (2003) and didn't like that one either. But his one is defeintly a winner. Thank you Mercedes to built this. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything. Radio is nice. New climate control's 'Off' button which was missing from older C and new BMW. Big buttons help a lot.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Best feature is the distinct design change between the sport and lux. Looks like a full size sedan compared to the previous C-Class (the Civic looked bigger). Rear seat room is equal to that of the E-Class. Lacks in power and gas mileage... but hey, its a Mercedes. If I wanted power I would wait for the AMG to tear the asphalt up...and gas... comon'.. who am I kidding? It's a Mercedes, I didn't buy it for fuel economy! Looks like a 50k car - I highly recommend the AMG 18" wheel upgrade.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DVD/Nav system is great. No touch- screen or buttons on the dash... convenient mouse type device at the front of the arm-rest. Great sound system and voice command/blue tooth makes me feel like James Bond. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am loving this car, and so do all the heads that keep turning when I ride by. I have the 2008 C300 Sport w/automatic & panoramic roof, black on black w/the aluminum interior trim. I always frowned upon black interiors but this car is stunning. I always owned front wheel drive cars in the past, Nissan Maxima & Murano, the feel of the acceleration is phenomenal, a nice mix of luxury and sport. I was amazed at how solid & sure the car drives in the rain, makes you want to push the envelope. I was leery transitioning to a car from a SUV but I don't miss it one bit. I thought the interior would feel cramped, but it feels quite comfortable & spacious, and I'm a healthy kinda guy</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got my black on black C300 Sport w/automatic last week. My biggest decision was settling on a color, almost got the white but found a black on black w/the panoramic roof in the dealers online inventory at a great price. I got $1,125.00 off the sticker & was happy w/the deal. This car is turning heads everywhere i go, getting honks & thumbs up while driving on the highway. after driving a Crossover SUV i was extremely pleased to get 400 mls on a full tank. I'm having a hard time leaving the car parked. The plan was too drive my old vehicle as a daily driver & keep the Benz for special occassions. This baby is too beautiful to leave sitting! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the C300 a couple of weeks ago and so far really love it. I traded a 2004 Accura TL for the C300 and I think MB is much better. Quieter overall ride, just as much power (or at least enough power), better handling and a really nice interior. Exterior with the new silver color looks really sharp. Car is built well and has a very solid feel. The handling on the road and quiet ride while driving is much better than the TL or previously owned Lexus. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Not as luxurious at the Infiniti G, not as sporty as the BMW 3 series and not as reliable as the IS350. Purchased it because it was priced the best out of all 3.

<TEXT>I like the new C class design its gorgeous. Nice car but not as much fun as the BMW, Lexus IS 350, Audi A4 or Infiniti G37 coupe. I was disappointed by the slow performance for a V6 with 268HP it felt very slow. Seats not that comfortable either. At least MB got the design right now they have to add more power and torque like BMW and Infiniti and Lexus. These all have over 300HP engines and are much quicker and more sporty than MB C350. But the MB has the best looks and styling so if you want looks and status the new C class is tough to beat. If you want sports luxury get a BMW, Lexus or Infiniti.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought an Artic White C350 with Light Grey and Black interior mid- August (premium II pkg and Pano-roof) Waited over a month but it was worth it! I got rid of my Lexus 2003 IS300 and am very pleased. It accelerates smoothly and quickly, I love the 7 speed transmission. The seats are extremely comfortable. It is so much quieter than my previous IS and even quieter than the new generation IS250/350. The ride is extremely smooth and I can not tell you how people have stopped me on the road and walking by to tell me how great this car looks! I have never owned a car that recieves so much attention!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got my black on black C300 Sport w/automatic last week. My biggest decision was settling on a color, almost got the white but found a black on black w/the panoramic roof in the dealers online inventory at a great price. I got $1,125.00 off the sticker & was happy w/the deal. This car is turning heads everywhere i go, getting honks & thumbs up while driving on the highway. after driving a Crossover SUV i was extremely pleased to get 400 mls on a full tank. I'm having a hard time leaving the car parked. The plan was too drive my old vehicle as a daily driver & keep the Benz for special occassions. This baby is too beautiful to leave sitting! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the C300 a couple of weeks ago and so far really love it. I traded a 2004 Accura TL for the C300 and I think MB is much better. Quieter overall ride, just as much power (or at least enough power), better handling and a really nice interior. Exterior with the new silver color looks really sharp. Car is built well and has a very solid feel. The handling on the road and quiet ride while driving is much better than the TL or previously owned Lexus. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Really lovely car. Very BMW like (taught suspension, excellent powerplant, good road view and road feel). Got the MB tex interior which feels a little cheap, but all told car is quite luxurious in a Germanic kind of way. While competition for this car is supposed to be the BMW 335i, I really think the better comparison is with the recent BMW E90 330i sedan with sport pkg. . Both cars are not speed demons, but are very entertaining as a daily driver and when the spirit moves you to carve up some road. As a middle aged man, I appreciate the ease of getting in/out of this vehicle and it's civilized demeanor around town. This car is now a viable alternative to the BMW 3 series.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great vehicle. I have only had it a short period of time, but love driving the car. My biggest complaint is that the navigatioin system I paid good money for is the worst nav system I have ever used. If you don't have an address of where you want to go forget finding it with the nav system. Search features are horrible at best. You are limited to one voice for directions, where others offer several voices. The nav system will override what you are trying to input most of the time and will prevent you from typing in the name of a street you are trying to navigate to. Simply put the nav system is junk. Do yourself a favor and buy a Garmin. The car is great otherwise.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's a C300 sport with multimedia package and AMG wheels. 7 speed A. I bought this car about 9 months ago. I used to drive a 2001 BMW 330Ci before. It is a very fun to drive car. Brakes are absolutely amazing! My 330 was good to but C300 brakes are just amazing! It handles very nice. It gives you the stiff sharp feeling when you drive aggressively way and a very smooth nice drive whn you cruise down the highway. I get about 32-34 mpg on the high way (very surprising but that's what the trip computers shows). Parking lot traffic gives me about 14-15 though. 330's performance was better than the C300. Responds faster when you kick in, but overall it's an amazing car. Needs more leg room in the bck</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first M-B and I really enjoy it. The quality of the build is very nice and it performs well for city and highway commuting. Although it is between a compact and a standard size sedan, I fit comfortably (being 5'-9" and 200 lbs). The heated seats are nice, and the DVD-NAV display is very cool. I don't have much trouble with the technology, other than trying to decide which one to use as this car is very multi-task functional. The engine is great for the size. I have owned Porsche, VW, Chevy, Ford and Chrysler products. Hands down this is the best overall package I've ever had. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is basically my wife's car. The extra .5 was just for me. I am blown away by the performance and handling of this small sedan. With traction control off, it will smoke the rear tires, and run to higth speed in short order. In fact, I'm taking to our local drag strip when it's broken in and the weather cools down to see what it'll turn. I know, I sound like a redneck, but who cares? I must mention that a bought this car with the 320 Multimedia Package, metallic paint, and I-Pod integration kit for 36K. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite is the engine. Look under the hood, and you'll notice a ram air induction system. Look at the front disc, and you'll notice cross drilled rotors with huge calipers grabbing those rotors.

<TEXT>It's a C300 sport with multimedia package and AMG wheels. 7 speed A. I bought this car about 9 months ago. I used to drive a 2001 BMW 330Ci before. It is a very fun to drive car. Brakes are absolutely amazing! My 330 was good to but C300 brakes are just amazing! It handles very nice. It gives you the stiff sharp feeling when you drive aggressively way and a very smooth nice drive whn you cruise down the highway. I get about 32-34 mpg on the high way (very surprising but that's what the trip computers shows). Parking lot traffic gives me about 14-15 though. 330's performance was better than the C300. Responds faster when you kick in, but overall it's an amazing car. Needs more leg room in the bck</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quite nice ride. Entertainment package, navigation, harman kordon sound system. AMG wheels look very hot! Steel gray looks awesome. Brakes, handling. Engine sound when you push the limits!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first M-B and I really enjoy it. The quality of the build is very nice and it performs well for city and highway commuting. Although it is between a compact and a standard size sedan, I fit comfortably (being 5'-9" and 200 lbs). The heated seats are nice, and the DVD-NAV display is very cool. I don't have much trouble with the technology, other than trying to decide which one to use as this car is very multi-task functional. The engine is great for the size. I have owned Porsche, VW, Chevy, Ford and Chrysler products. Hands down this is the best overall package I've ever had. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DVD-NAV, engine, power seats, moonroof and windows are pressure-sensitive to prevent injuries. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is basically my wife's car. The extra .5 was just for me. I am blown away by the performance and handling of this small sedan. With traction control off, it will smoke the rear tires, and run to higth speed in short order. In fact, I'm taking to our local drag strip when it's broken in and the weather cools down to see what it'll turn. I know, I sound like a redneck, but who cares? I must mention that a bought this car with the 320 Multimedia Package, metallic paint, and I-Pod integration kit for 36K. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite is the engine. Look under the hood, and you'll notice a ram air induction system. Look at the front disc, and you'll notice cross drilled rotors with huge calipers grabbing those rotors. The 7-speed transmission is nearly industry leading, and aluminum pedals is really cool. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bigger, faster, smoother, and quieter than my 2004 Comprressor Sports Sedan. Appears to be improved in all areas. Classic Mercedes exterior styling, but the company should swallow half the cost & put real leather in all models to elevate itself above the BMW 3 Series entry sedan. Received a great deal with year end factory rebates & convenient home delivery! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Ok, let's get to the point. I see some reviews about the poor quality of this vehicle. It's not true! We got this vehicle a couple of months ago, I am a young mom (that was not about to drive a minivan around) with two girls ages 6 and 3. We were on the freeway one night, in the carpool lane when traffic suddenly stopped. With the great brakes in this car I was able to stop without hitting the car in front of me. But the car behind me was not so lucky. They plowed into us going approx. 70mph! Both of the people in that car (a Nissan Altima) passed away. We survived with minimal injuries. When the police arrived they credited the good build of the car. We paid less then $3500 to repair!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car drives pretty well, but the stiff suspension can be rough on bad L.A. streets. Acceleration is OK, much better than the C300, but not as great as I would have hoped. What is great is how much better mileage I get than my old car. I pay $500/month (incl. tax) on my lease, but I save over $100/month in fuel. The car is comfortable and generally pretty quiet. It is a good all-around transportation vehicle. Surprisingly ample room for passengers and luggage.</TEXT>

On a recent 1200 mile road trip I was amazed to see my mileage climb to 31.5 MPG. That was over 890 miles, 13 hours with an average speed of 68 MPH. and all on 93 octane gasoline</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd C class, I had a 2005 C230K, black on black, what a car. The styling of the newest C Class (300) series is exceptional. Mercedes has really stepped up to the plate on this machine. The seats are very comfortable, instruments cluster is easier to adjust and read, and the Blue tooth is fantastic, I'm from California, hands-free law. aggggh! This auto is definitely a looker. The power plant is a hold over from the last couple of years but still has ample get-up and go for the weight of the car. The BMW's 3 series, are so plain and have no styling, boring. You will be much happier with this vehicle! I have the 18" AMG rims and low profile wheels.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This new C300 is making me just as grateful I chose another Mercedes Benz. These machines are really at the top of their class. I drove the Lexus, the BMW, and the G35. For me, I was always comparing them with handling, and styling. MB won again!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Disclaimer: I am leaving my Corvette for the C300 so my performance notes may be a bit off from the normal person. The exterior of the C300 sport is definitely exciting from the front, but a bit pedestrian from the sides or rear. Still it's a beautiful car. The interior is very well-built and comfortable. The dual climate controls and steering wheel control buttons are excellent. The handling is very nice - not as sporty as a sports car, but tight. It is definitely smooth enough for a daily driver, but you still get very good road feel. Performance on the 300 is decent with the manual. It can get up and go better than most of the cars out there. (Still miss the Corvette power!)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I custom ordered a Mars Red C300 Sport edition with a manual transmission. I love this car. Every single day, heads turn to look at this vehicle and I've owned BMW and Lexus and never had so much fun. I purchased it with all the options and love the Sirius radio, navigation, Harmon Kardon speakers, I-Pod connector, no-hands Bluetooth, and 18in AMG wheels. It doesn't get great mileage, especially with the cost of premium gas, but then again, it is a sports car. I prefer the C300 manual vs. the 7-Matic because I can really drive it like it's meant to be driven. </TEXT>

Would not have considered buying an MB in this class 1 year ago, but now believe Audi and BMW have some serious ground to make up. To think that a VW Passat is easily more expensive, blows my mind. MB hit the bullseye on the price performance target, and when the market catches up I won't feel as special in by beautiful new ride. But who cares, I love going places just to drive it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've driven this car for 3 months and am not impressed. The tiptronic shifts for itself when I rev towards redline. The interior seems cheap. The volume controls on the steering wheel should be on the left side instead of the right. The car seems crude compared to the Acura TSX and BMW 3 and Lexus IS. My other car is the TSX and the tiptronic shifts much better and much more responsive. And it won't upshift by itself!! It is also difficult to coax a downshift when at medium rpms, this is no problem on the Acura. The instruments are archaic and difficult to read when compared to the Japanese counterparts. People who are happy with this car must have driven Buicks beforehand. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very disappointed with my first M-B. The wind noise at highway speeds is terrible, have to turn radio up 3-4 notches just to hear, dealer says nothing they can do. The placement of the cruise control lever is a joke, don't know how many times I end up signaling a right turn and not turning on the control. My bluetooth phone worked fine in my last car, but will not connect in the M-B. The navigation system got me the first time I needed it with the "Prepare to turn right". At the next street I turned and as I did it then says "In 800 feet turn right onto bla bla street". Wouldn't it have been just as easy to say "In a quarter mile, right turn etc". </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car! I have a C300 sport in Palladium silver with Grey/Black MB-tex interior. The only options I got are 7-speed automatic and iPod integration, which I'm very happy with. This car is the most solid and secure car I've ever driven and the overall build quality is fantastic. The steering is lighter than expected, but it makes it very easy to drive. Very strong brakes, plenty of power, a nice exhaust note coming out the back, a firm yet comfortable ride, and excellent, well controlled cornering. It's very quiet as well. Also, the aggressive styling makes heads turn! I test drove a 328i, but the C300 is a much better value,smoother,and the styling is worlds ahead of the 3.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a new car for a good while. I was about to get the new Lexus ISF but then I came across the C63. Daammmmmm. First of all it has a very clean look. The exterior has a good blend of sporty and luxurious. The interior is also very nice. A very clean and luxurious look. However I'm not too sure about the bucket seats. Though the leather is absolutely gorgeous, I feel the seats could have been more comfortable. There ok though, some people really like them. The best part is the engine. It has superpowers. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Manual mode; fun to play around the 5000 rpms. Harmon kardon sound system is good. Leather is beautiful. Navigation is easy to understand and cool to look at as you drive. The engine isnt a feature, but I can't stress how much I like the acceleration. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked it up at the factory in Germany and drove it around Europe on the autobahn and back count ry roads. Fun to drive and very responsive on the short on and off-ramps of Europe. Did not get many add-ons (P 1 package only), but it is great. I love my car! Found that the folding mirrors were a godsend in medieval towns where a few streets were unbelievably narrow. The bellhops in every town loved the arctic white--most cars of that model in Europe were black, grey or silver--and I really like the Savannah/cashmere interior. Get the all weather mats though. Could see that the carpet would get dirty rather quickly without them. Especially love the steering.</TEXT>

I would recommend the P2 package. You will really appreciate the visibility afforded by the Bi-Xenon headlamps. Once you have purchased Mercedes no other vehicle will do.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>P2 package and the 7 speed automatic </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car! I have a C300 sport in Palladium silver with Grey/Black MB-tex interior. The only options I got are 7-speed automatic and iPod integration, which I'm very happy with. This car is the most solid and secure car I've ever driven and the overall build quality is fantastic. The steering is lighter than expected, but it makes it very easy to drive. Very strong brakes, plenty of power, a nice exhaust note coming out the back, a firm yet comfortable ride, and excellent, well controlled cornering. It's very quiet as well. Also, the aggressive styling makes heads turn! I test drove a 328i, but the C300 is a much better value,smoother,and the styling is worlds ahead of the 3.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The aggressive styling, AMG bodywork, quiet, solid and well composed chassis, nice exhaust sound. Also, it comes standard with a Sunroof, Bluetooth, and power seats. I also love the optional iPod integration.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Let's face it, the reason why we consider this car is for the status symbol. For the price, this vehicle delivers quality, styling, and great features all packed into an entry level luxury vehicle. The best features of this car are the multimedia package, build quality, and performance. The Multimedia boasts a 7.1 surround sound system, DVD, navi, voice command, bluetooth connectivity, and a 6 disc cd changer. It's always conversational piece with every passenger. As for build quality, try standing on another car's door panel, and say goodbye to the hinges. This car will hold a 400lb person with no problem. Styling? Ask everyone who stares. The best looking luxury sedan on the market.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Multimedia package. 18 inch AMG rims and tires. The small details. Like how the hand rest doesn't bang against the interior roof, but retracts softly. How the 5 holes in rear tail lights control airflow around the car to a flow into a nice stream behind the car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking for a new car for a good while. I was about to get the new Lexus ISF but then I came across the C63. Daammmmmm. First of all it has a very clean look. The exterior has a good blend of sporty and luxurious. The interior is also very nice. A very clean and luxurious look. However I'm not too sure about the bucket seats. Though the leather is absolutely gorgeous, I feel the seats could have been more comfortable. There ok though, some people really like them. The best part is the engine. It has superpowers. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Manual mode; fun to play around the 5000 rpms. Harmon kardon sound system is good. Leather is beautiful. Navigation is easy to understand and cool to look at as you drive. The engine isnt a feature, but I can't stress how much I like the acceleration. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked it up at the factory in Germany and drove it around Europe on the autobahn and back count ry roads. Fun to drive and very responsive on the short on and off-ramps of Europe. Did not get many add-ons (P 1 package only), but it is great. I love my car! Found that the folding mirrors were a godsend in medieval towns where a few streets were unbelievably narrow. The bellhops in every town loved the arctic white--most cars of that model in Europe were black, grey or silver--and I really like the Savannah/cashmere interior. Get the all weather mats though. Could see that the carpet would get dirty rather quickly without them. Especially love the steering.</TEXT>

The styling is unbeatable, the car is drop dead gorgeous and the rims are so sporty I didn't even have to upgrade to the AMGs. However where this car falls short is performance. I test drove a Lexus IS350 and BMW 335i both had the same size engine, and same MPGs yet they were much quicker and more powerful. About a full second faster 0-60. Also the interior styling is bland and not as impressive as the exterior.

Mine happened to be full leather, but MB Tex is excellent. Do not get the tan interior. Off color in daylight. Cheap looking. Bad design. Black over grey is best overall. Great in any light. P2 package is worth the money. You have all the luxury ammenities this way. Multimedia is worth the cost for the GPS, Logic 7 surround sound, satellite radio, etc. All great. Very adequate power for size and weight. Follow recommended tire pressures. Gas mileage is exactly what the sticker states. Can beat 25 with cruise. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had our Benz for over 6 months now and still feel like we made a great choice. The power is more than what we need. The car feels strong on the road and is very quiet! It holds the road very well. The 4matic transmission allows us on steep inclines on ice and snow covered Denver streets to go right around cars spinning their wheels. The sound system is great and to sit back and watch a movie, in 5.1 sound, while waiting for our daughter's soccer practice to end is like a home away from home.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After having driven Volvos for 30 years, I decided I needed a change so purchased a Mercedes C300 Luxury 4matic after test driving a number of cars. The car is easy to drive and very easy to park. It holds the road well. The seats could be a little softer. The visibility during the day is excellent. I purchased the Premium 1 package. The rain sensing wipers as part of the package only work well when it is raining hard- a time when the regular wipers would provide the same performance. The auto-dimming rear view mirror blacks out almost completely when there is a car behind you- I find this extremely dangerous since one is not able to change lanes safely under the circumstances. </TEXT>

Decided to buy a smaller, less costly, but still high end auto that would be great in the snow. Had my Land Rover LR3 in for service one day, saw the new 300 and test drove it. Wow!

Never considered Mercedes as my wife called it "an old man's car." That was until was saw the new C class parked in front of a restaurant. Wow! What a head-turner. The handling is great, fit and finish are perfect, enough gadgets to make it interesting but not distracting. Getting great gas mileage (24 mpg combined) and I was shocked at what a great value the car is, especially compared to the 3 series. 4 matic handles a Minnesota winter just fine.</TEXT>

My car has two option the i-pod in the glove box a waste for me, but not my kids. Also the optional headlamps which are great for lighting your way. I strongly suggest this option for older folks, it help alot. So far the car is great, and the fuel economy is not bad either in the upper 20's combine with city and highway. This car is a lot for the buck, and truely a great value. This car car hums like a bimmer, and rides like a tank as a Mercedes should be.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am completely excited on delivery of the vehicle. Great handling particularly in snow and ice in Michigan. Performs as per Mercedes standards. It has a big problem which is the security system. I had somebody try to break into my car at night, broke the driver side glass and the alarm of the car did not go off and the tele aid operator tells me it is a passive alarm and it does not go off until the doors have been tried to open. Funny because I think if someone trie to gain access to your car by damaging the window the alarm should go off and as an owner I'm surprised with the answer. </TEXT>

This car is absolutely beautiful and will still look just as good in my driveway 10 years from now. The performance of this car is great and has sufficient power to press you back into your seat! The multimedia package is an absolute must for this car, especially if youre going to spend all this money. The interior looks fantastic and not ugly like the BMW 3 series. Eventhough it's a "sport", this car is built more for touring and cruising than racing. But why would you want to drive off fast in this car anyway? Cruise and let people stare at it!</TEXT>

Never considered Mercedes as my wife called it "an old man's car." That was until was saw the new C class parked in front of a restaurant. Wow! What a head-turner. The handling is great, fit and finish are perfect, enough gadgets to make it interesting but not distracting. Getting great gas mileage (24 mpg combined) and I was shocked at what a great value the car is, especially compared to the 3 series. 4 matic handles a Minnesota winter just fine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After test driving alot of cars in this class BMW, Infinity, Cadillac, and Audi. When you add everything up exterior looks, performance, ride and comfort. The Mercedes was the clear winner. I ordered it fully loaded with the 18 inch AMG wheels,multimedia and panorama sun roof. This car has quick acceleration, a smooth and quiet ride, and a solid feel. It's a fun car to drive and gets a lot of looks. I love this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned several MB before, but this one is a car that stands uo to a BMW in ride, and size. The performance is excellence as well as the handling. My car has two option the i-pod in the glove box a waste for me, but not my kids. Also the optional headlamps which are great for lighting your way. I strongly suggest this option for older folks, it help alot. So far the car is great, and the fuel economy is not bad either in the upper 20's combine with city and highway. This car is a lot for the buck, and truely a great value. This car car hums like a bimmer, and rides like a tank as a Mercedes should be.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great bluetooth, and great headlamps option. Wish I had brought the gps option. Love the 6 month Sirrus radio, who needs an I-pod or cd's.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently purchased my C-Class 350. Before doing so, I was torn between this car and the new '08 Cadillac CTS. After test driving both vehicles, and thoroughly comparing all features, I decided to go with the Mercedes. Now, I'm pleased to say that I made the right choice! I love this car! It has quick acceleration, handles beautifully and had a smooth quiet ride. I ordered it fully loaded and have upgraded Mercedes AMG chrome wheels. The multimedia sound system is awesome and the craftmanship is very sounded! The Germans really know what they are doing when it comes to putting out quality automobiles. I could not be happier! I am so glad I invested in this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am completely excited on delivery of the vehicle. Great handling particularly in snow and ice in Michigan. Performs as per Mercedes standards. It has a big problem which is the security system. I had somebody try to break into my car at night, broke the driver side glass and the alarm of the car did not go off and the tele aid operator tells me it is a passive alarm and it does not go off until the doors have been tried to open. Funny because I think if someone trie to gain access to your car by damaging the window the alarm should go off and as an owner I'm surprised with the answer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the C300 sport, 7 speed auto, 18" AMG rims, multimedia, ipod kit, premium 1 package for a little over $40K OTD. This car is absolutely beautiful and will still look just as good in my driveway 10 years from now. The performance of this car is great and has sufficient power to press you back into your seat! The multimedia package is an absolute must for this car, especially if youre going to spend all this money. The interior looks fantastic and not ugly like the BMW 3 series. Eventhough it's a "sport", this car is built more for touring and cruising than racing. But why would you want to drive off fast in this car anyway? Cruise and let people stare at it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is very fun to drive and the styling is a home run. Traded in 03 Lexus LS 430. So the Benz is a lot more responsive in the handling department but the road noise is a lot louder. Test drove the BMW 335 wow, that motor was awesome but with the ipod interface, the hard drive, the superior cup holders, and with the price differance we gave the nod to the Benz.

<TEXT>In my purchase decision I compared the C300 Luxery model to the Lexus IS 250/350, BMW 135/335 and Saab 9-3. For all I was looking at '08 models. In my opinion, the Mercedes C300 offered the greatest driving performance and luxury experience along with the best value. Certainly the fun factor is greater in the BMW's, the Lexus is slightly quieter and the Saab most offordable. The C300 is, however, very fun to drive and the engineering allows you to push the 3.0L V6 to its limits. A very fun ride but with comfort for every day driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's a Benz! The redesign is a great step up from previous models (ie - lack of American design influence is a huge plus). The options are reasonably priced comared to competition.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car for it's looks, i.e. its untraditional new exterior design. Being formerly from Germany, I'm very disappointed about the interior, I expected a better quality. Over 15 years ago I had a 190 2.3 which had a better quality MB Tex material inside, but it felt like leather, In this car it is like rough sandpaper. Interior space is tight for me (6-3 ft). Storage compartments are small, the worst is its tiny glove compartment, not even the car manual fits in it and no sunglass compartment. I had an Acura Legend, a TL, a BMW 530 and last an Infinity FX35, all had by far better interior features and materials. I wish I hadn't traded in my FX!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased the C350 with leather, Prem 2, MMedia, Ipod intergration. Must say I made the right choice over the Lex and Infin. What a fun drive, great pickup, perfect balance driving exp. Mercedes has done a nice job with the interior design and space at 6'2" the car accomodates my ht. The C350 no longer has that femine design (2007), the 2008 is masculine with a design women will enjoy as well. The car performs exceptionally well with the overall beauty of a smaller C63 AMG with a $100k lower price. The only negative for me is the IPOD intergration, doesn't allow full fuctionality of IPOD. Plays songs alphabetically. What a drag for a nice car. Don't buy comes with standard mp3 jack.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'll admit I enjoy new cars, this being the 4th benz and 3rd C Class I've owned. I've actually been away from MB for 7 years with a BMW 3 series and 5 series recently. Just prior to my 2008 C350 Sport, I leased a terrific Japanese product, an Infiniti M45 Sport. But Lexus, Infiniti and Acura don't compare in styling. This new C class is impressive. It's turning out to be more a pleasure to drive each time I get in. People stare, its beautiful. Off all the cars I've owned, I think its the most stylish. Performance is predictable, acceleration is perfect and stopping is awesome. This MB has captivated me like my first 1986 300E. I am thrilled to be back as a client. </TEXT>

Ended up test driving a C300 and loved it so much we took back the other one and bought the C300. What a difference a year makes. This car is unbelievable. It is very firm and hugs the road. I have put about 3K mi on it from a road trip from Va to FL and back and I have never enjoyed driving so much. If you are looking at this car, youmust get the multimedia option! You will be sorry if you don't. I avg. 26mpg w/ the cruise set at 80. Just wished the the tank was bigger. The car is just wonderful!

<TEXT>Reason to buy, was looking to purchase cars from 3-Series BMW, Audi A4, Lincoln MKZ ( German or American). I don't believe in the Asian luxury line of cars - Acura and Lexus, they are just expensive Hondas and Toyotas. Another reason to the buy a German car was that, I have driven MB and BMW ( parents and sibling owned). This car is a very improved C-Class, The 2008 C class was introduced around the time I was looking to buy and hence I test drove the previous C classes ( all different models). This car is a winner in a lot of areas compared to its predecessor.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Four wheel drive, I am from Chicago, happier than most of my friends in winter. Bluetooth and command based audio, better electronics. Well priced ( compared to BMW of same capacity) Exterior is superb, also it is a run down from previous CLK and S classes. More bang for the buck. Great handler</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased a C300 in palladium silver with black MB-Tex seats. This car gets noticed no matter where you go. Very smooth ride and you hardly know the vehicle has a transmission it is so silent. Seats are very comfortable and all guages are in the proper place. Gas mileage has been very good..averaging 25 plus on the highway and 19 in town. This is our first MB and it is definitely a winner. One to keep for a long time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my 2006 Acura TL for the Sport 300 C -4MATIC about one month ago and I'm now happier.The car is much more impressive and looks like it costs considerably more than the Acura.Handling in the snow and rain is superb in contrast to the Acura's scary handling in wet stuff.Three Series BMW's(RWD) are also scary unless you get AWD but the cost escalates and is considerably more than the C class. I don't like the looks of the Infinity G nor the Lexus thus the MB decision.The 228 HP. engine is fast enough and responsive, the trunk is fine especially with the fold down seats(fits 3 golf bags),the pop up Nav screen and the Harmon K. audio are neat conversation items.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really like this car, drives very well and is especially fun to drive. Comfortable, but seats are really firm and I can't tell if they are a bit too firm for long trips. Handles well, makes you want to take curves a little faster than you should :) Rear seat fits grown people pretty well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I already have 7700 miles on the car in just a little over 2 months. I opted for the Sport, P2 Package, Manual Transmission, Panorama Roof, 18" AMG wheels, multimedia package, Ipod Kit, and TeleAid. I recommend this car to anyone looking for quality, performance, style and a heck of a fun ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I were looking at the IS and the 3 series. Test drove a ton of cars, and ended up getting a 07 C280. Ended up test driving a C300 and loved it so much we took back the other one and bought the C300. What a difference a year makes. This car is unbelievable. It is very firm and hugs the road. I have put about 3K mi on it from a road trip from Va to FL and back and I have never enjoyed driving so much. If you are looking at this car, youmust get the multimedia option! You will be sorry if you don't. I avg. 26mpg w/ the cruise set at 80. Just wished the the tank was bigger. The car is just wonderful! Gets looks everywhere I go and I cant stop talking about this car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The MultiMedia option. Being able to use the PCMICA slot to listen to music from the PC. Power, safety. ESP is amazingly accurate. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Reason to buy, was looking to purchase cars from 3-Series BMW, Audi A4, Lincoln MKZ ( German or American). I don't believe in the Asian luxury line of cars - Acura and Lexus, they are just expensive Hondas and Toyotas. Another reason to the buy a German car was that, I have driven MB and BMW ( parents and sibling owned). This car is a very improved C-Class, The 2008 C class was introduced around the time I was looking to buy and hence I test drove the previous C classes ( all different models). This car is a winner in a lot of areas compared to its predecessor.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Four wheel drive, I am from Chicago, happier than most of my friends in winter. Bluetooth and command based audio, better electronics. Well priced ( compared to BMW of same capacity) Exterior is superb, also it is a run down from previous CLK and S classes. More bang for the buck. Great handler</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased a C300 in palladium silver with black MB-Tex seats. This car gets noticed no matter where you go. Very smooth ride and you hardly know the vehicle has a transmission it is so silent. Seats are very comfortable and all guages are in the proper place. Gas mileage has been very good..averaging 25 plus on the highway and 19 in town. This is our first MB and it is definitely a winner. One to keep for a long time. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth ride and very comfortable seating..you can adjust the seats just right. Guages are very good. Harmon Kardon stereo has very good sound. Gas mileage is very good. Good pick up but definitely not a speed demon. Exterior styling is gorgeous. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in my 2006 Acura TL for the Sport 300 C -4MATIC about one month ago and I'm now happier.The car is much more impressive and looks like it costs considerably more than the Acura.Handling in the snow and rain is superb in contrast to the Acura's scary handling in wet stuff.Three Series BMW's(RWD) are also scary unless you get AWD but the cost escalates and is considerably more than the C class. I don't like the looks of the Infinity G nor the Lexus thus the MB decision.The 228 HP. engine is fast enough and responsive, the trunk is fine especially with the fold down seats(fits 3 golf bags),the pop up Nav screen and the Harmon K. audio are neat conversation items.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned 3 mercedes C series and this is by far the best to date. My wife and I were going to be practical so we looked at the Accord and Camry. By the time you put everything in them that comes standard in the C300, you are over $30k. It makes it no brainer then to buy the C class.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The ride, performance, and quality are very close to the Edmunds review. The change from a full size SUV to the C300 was a major concern as I am over 6'3". As it turns out I am confortable in the C300 with some legroom to spare. However I don't think many people could sit in the back behind me as the leg room is quite limited. The mpg savings will off-set the slight increase in payments. This is probably one of the best vehicles that I have owned. I highly recommend the C300.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Nice Car</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>First time owner of a Mercedes. Engine and transmission very smooth. Nice handling. Lots of standard features, including safety features. Very fast in breaking. Took car to almost 130 - yeah, crazy me!! Car felt very smooth - can't feel the speed. I cruise on freeway and realize I have to ease on the pedal - I'm doing 90. Only 1 complaint - you feel the bumps too hard. Needs improvement on suspension. Yes, it has a sports suspension which has been lowered over the luxury model, but you sure feel those bumps. I've taken few pounds off pressure of the tires to releave this problem - much beter, however, my "check pressure" keeps coming up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got into my first Mercedes, and I love the car except for the fuel mileage, no matter what I do or how I drive I can not seem to get better than 17MPG, which I think is horrible seeing that I went from a diesel F250 that got 19MPG. Other than the mileage, the car is terrific, very nice ride</TEXT>

<TEXT>We own this car now for 3 months and this is our 4th Benz (240D, ML320, CLK430). The difference between my old CLK 430 to the new C300 is quite dramatic and a very nice upgrade. I'm 6.4 ft tall, in my 40's and this car fits me perfect. Seats are very comfy, steering and just driving it is a lot of fun. While I do miss my V8 the car has enough power for everydays driving and I have to say it's quite quick on the freeway. Now my wife wants to drive it all the time and I have to drive our old car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a car that I purchased for my wife, who had been driving a 2002 Audi A6. I realize this car is smaller and not designed to compete with the A6 (even the older 2002 Audi A6), however, things that she and I both notice everytime we drive it on the highway is the wind noise emulating from the winshield. In snow (we have 4Matic) it doesn't handle like the Quatro A6 she'd grown to love...not even close...the back seat room is limited to children (no way 4 adults will be comfortable on a trip in this car. Lastly, the dash (she has the pop up nav screen version too) lacks style...it looks "american," and is outclassed by the new Cadillac CTS that it competes with...that's a first!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was not too sure on this vehicle or the BMW 328. Once I found out that Mercedes eliminated Chrysler from producing their vehicles I felt much better. My vehicle was produced in Stuttgart Germany, which is great and this first run of C class vehicles were produced their also. If you wait too long you will get South African models which would make me guess on the labor quality. The ride is smooth and the acceleration is quick. The navigation and 12 speaker Harmon Kardon 7.1 audio is top notch. This is an all around great car with much more prestige than a BMW. Great job Mercedes. </TEXT>
