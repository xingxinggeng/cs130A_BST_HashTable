<TEXT>I owned a 1990 2 wheel drive Toyota extra cab for 18 years. Best vehicle I ever owned. I sold it with over 300,000 miles on it. I wanted a 4 wheel drive new p/u. I love this pick up more than any vehicle I have ever owned or driven. It is a fast and good looking p/u. I love the stereo system/cd player. It has a lot of pick up and contrary to reports I've read my pick up is very quiet. I've had no problems at all in the 14 months I've owned it. Although the running boards look great, they are in the way trying to get into and out of the p/u. I would never own any other kind of mid- sized truck besides the Toyota. To me it is the best truck on the road. Bar none!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2008 Tacoma 4x4 intending to keep it a long time as they are supposedly known for reliability. Mechanically, the truck was fine and had no issues. I liked the truck and enjoyed driving it. Fuel mileage was OK with an average of 17 to 18 mixed city and highway driving. On the highway, it would get 20mpg if you stay under 70mph. I recently got rid of the truck as the frame was rusting excessively. I have never driven it on a salted road and I did not park it anywhere near the coast. Toyota's rep was extremely condescending and absolutely refused to do anything. No treatment, no coating, NOTHING! Check toyota frame rust issues and realize the problem still exists in '08.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive and decent fuel mileage. Lots of interior room for a smaller truck. The truck won't last though. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I used to have a '93 Toyota pickup, 5 spd manual with the 22RE engine that I loved. Put 24k miles on my '08 so far and no major complaints. The SR5 4.0L V6 has more than ample power. Roomy interior. Gated automatic shift lever does not have locking button so that the lever can shift at anytime if it is accidentally bumped. The downshifts could be smoother and less often, but aren't that big a deal. Wish I'd gotten the stick shift instead, but at the time I wanted to try an automatic after 15 years of my old truck. Love the suicide rear doors on the access cab. But rear seating is cramped and should only be for short trips or kids. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tons of power. Roomy interior. Composite bed liner (seems like plastic but it's supposedly stronger than steel). Bed storage for ropes. Adjustable tie down cleats. Storage under rear seats. Looks great! Fun to drive! Safety features standard, like ABS and stability assist. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This really is a great truck, I have used it for hunting & fishing and some off-roading. I have the 4.0L V6 PreRunner & which ever one is the 4-door. I absolutely love it. Used to own a Dodge ram 1500, and I'm glad I got a Tacoma, though I wish I had gotten a Tundra. Pros: Good & Powerful 4.0L V6, Somewhat good fuel economy (depends on how you drive, as with every other vehicle), Great off-roader even though it's 4x2 (just no mudding or something of that sort), I got 0-60MPH in about 6.5-7 Seconds. Cons: Side Curtain air bag became standard on 2009 model, iPod connection became standard on 09 model (big deal for me), Somewhat jumpy if you don't have any load.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>-The Biggg 4.0L V6, lots of power! -In my opinion, this truck is overpowered -Stock radio and speakers sound nice, compared to the ones in my old RAM.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First, let me say, I love the seats, the driving position is perfect, not too low for me (I am 5'9"). Brakes are amazing, Brake Assist and Electronic Brake Force Distribution really work. Gas Mileage is good, 20 city and 24 highway. No squeaks, tight truck. The Stock stereo is OK. Now the bad news, the ride is punishing! It is jarring even over the small bumps! My wife loves it, I am giving it to her and buying something else!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this truck Feb 28,2008. I traded out of it with 17,000 mi Jan 1 2009. The front passenger floor board area was "creaking" whenever I drive over an uneven surface. They re-welded a joint that somehow came apart with only 13,000mi. My roof leaked because of a defect on the factory- installed roof rack (took them 3 times to fix). They replaced the outside seal around the windshield because it was making a "whistling noise" at 75 MPH. Truck wouldn't start sometimes and they couldn't figure out why. I just gave up on it and let somebody else worry about what else could go wrong with it. GOOD BYE TOYOTA FOREVER!! It's the end of an era.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this truck used with 15K on it. I traded in an 89 4runner w/200K 13 mpg. The primary reason for buying a small truck was the fuel economy. Fuel prices seem to be on the rise once again, who knows what will happen in the years to come. I live in S.W. FL. and commute 20 miles each way a day. Mostly at 45 to 60 mph, mixed city driving mostly. My first tank returned 25.8 MPG! I "babied" the truck trying to keep the RPM under 2K. I did spin it up when needed. You can get great fuel economy out of this truck and still be courteous to others.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The simplicity. An automatic to appease my wife, A/C because I live in S.W. FL. and a bedliner. It's all I wanted, I'll run this into the ground. The less electronic stuff to go wrong later the better. I need to add that I am 6"4 at 265lbs and I fit beautifully.... comfortable interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Owned a Tacoma extra cab previously. Bought quad cab site unseen- it's enormous! Toyota blew up Tacoma like a balloon. Love the power and room, but feel like I'm driving a dump truck. 57 y/o lady and it's much more truck than expected. Hear the vibration that others note. Drove the same model at dealer, and vibration was worse than mine. Everything else is usual Toyota quality. 23mpg hwy-comfy/roomy for husband, me & dog on long trips. We have trouble with visibility on right side. Gorgeous and feels very safe- would love to have had this when kids were young. Hope I get used to the size (mammoth- not the Tacoma I'm used to!) and hope to keep for many years as with other models we've owned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Best looking "compact" truck. Feels very safe on the road. Well designed roomy interior. Two adults comfortable in back. Decent mileage. Great acceleration. It's a Toyota- know it's going to last and last.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my truck February of 08. I have a factory-installed roof rack that leaked from the drivers side rail into the cabin with only 8000 mi that took 2 times to fix. My passenger floor board had to be re-welded because of squeaking noise that sounds like metals buckling whenever I drive over uneven pavements. Oh, they have to remove my passenger side front door, my steering wheel and my entire dashboard area just gain access to that one particular spot. My new car smell didn't last but a couple of months which was replaced by the aroma of a freshly welded metals which by the way lingered for more than 3 mos. I've owned 4 different Toyotas in the past. 08 Tacoma is a disappointment.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven my truck about 36,000 miles in 10 months(outside sales w/large territory). Power and handling are excellent for a truck. Mileage stays between 21.5 and 22 with mostly highway driving. Previously drove a Colorado for 150,000 miles. Toyota power and quieter ride are a serious upgrade.

<TEXT>This truck is a tank in mud and snow. Less than a week after we purchased it, we took it out into the Owhyee Mountains. While crawling up hills though several inches of mud, the Tacoma tracked very well where other (much larger) trucks had slid off the road and torn up the brush. My Tacoma has forded many streams and climbed over rocks without developing any problems. With lots of payload (lbs) and a truck bed, I can fit all my gear, including shovels and saws, for winter camping in the truck, plus my dog's crate in the back seat. It handles surprisingly well on highway - better than my Subaru Forester. Over 16000 miles, I've averaged 20 mpg in city, highway, and off-road miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first Toyota truck I have ever owned. I've only had it a few weeks but could not be happier. Plenty of power for passing and a very comfortable ride for a pick-up truck. The interior of the truck was set up very nicely with no gauges being blocked from your view with the steering wheel. I've seen several reviews from professional websites that claim the seating position is too low. I'm 6'2" and I say the seating position is too high. Other than that an overall exceptional truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>All around solid, dependable truck. Daily driver, 75 highway miles/day. Average 20-22 MPG. Traded an '03 Dodge Dakota for it, and what a difference. Not all good, sadly. As some have said here, the brakes are horrible and Toyota should be ashamed of them. The peppy 4.0L V6 makes the 3.9 in the Dakota seem like a 4 cylinder however, with excellent torque and high end power. Ride is good... it's a truck, after all. Much more comfortable than the Dodge, and I love the dash/control layout. Once I wear out the atrocious stock Dunlop tires and replace with something decent handling will be great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great truck, this is my 5 Toyota. But with the 6 speed manual the throttle does strange thing. When you are stopped the RPS are ~ 900 when the truck is rolling and not in gear the RPM go up by them self to ~ 1300? When you are moving in gear and you let off the gas the throttle does not close very fast, it feel like it closes part of the way then in 2 sec it shuts completely. All of this I think hurts the gas mileage 16-17. May be the auto would be better. Yes the cd player need to play MP3s and the 4wd low in trick (but when you learn to push the clutch first it is fine) and the stock tires are low grip. One more thing the plastic bed is very slick. I still like this truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a 2004 extended cab Prerunner prior to my 2008 4x4. What a big difference! The 2008 turns tighter [better u-turns]. The ride is way better even with the TRD offroad package my 04 did not have. The 04 wandered all over the road, the 08 stays centered better. Every gripe I had about the 04 seemed to be fixed by Toyota in the 08. Don't get me wrong the 04 was a great truck, with absolutly no mechanical issues in 38,000 miles of use. I'm sure this 08 will be the same. I just wish I had opted for the top line stereo. Was told it was only available in sport package. This truck tows my 2200 lb boat effortlessly. For the price, the towing package is a bargain for what you get. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Toyota. Although I have been sold on the overall quality of Toyota, I am somewhat disappointed with my present truck. I get vibration in the steering wheel between 55 and 70 MPH. After three trips to the dealership and replacement of two tires,I still have the vibration. Now the metal framework in the seatback on the driver's side is coming out through the fabric. The A/C fan motor would only work on high speed (resistor replacement required). The transmission shifts rough, the door speakers buzz when the bass is turned on step 5 (volume is only at medium). My best gas mileage so far is 20.2 MPG (hwy). Did I mention I only have 5200 miles since purchased new.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was starting a job, and I knew I would be driving a lot of miles, so I went with the Tacoma. I live in Northern California, and like to go camping, and snowboarding. I went with the TRD Sport 4x4, and it drives like a car. No body roll, or jarring bounces like other trucks. Very smooth ride. I used to drive a Volvo, which is notorious for having the most comfortable seats, and the comfort factor is very similar in the Tacoma. It has tons of interior storage space, and is very well laid out. I also installed a new exhaust system, and it gave me an almost 20% increase in MPG. 17 to around 19 city, and 19 to 23~24 hwy. Overall, incredibly pleased, and would buy again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling. Steering wheel controls. Seat comfort. Toyota maintenance plan (free maintenance and car wash). Easy acceleration, and nice kick when you need it on the highway. Driving 80 feels like 40 or 50. Easy to get a feel for the truck. Great cruise control.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 14,000 miles, the mileage @ 70 MPH is now up to 24 MPG. That's satisfactory for a 4x4. Pickup is smooth and the bench seat okay on long trips. Don't care for the Dunlap tires; they're smooth, but sure don't have the quality of Michelins. I added a factory cruise control and 2 factory 'D' ring tie-downs to the front of the bed. This little rascal ought to come stock (or at least available) with intermittent wipers & cruise. It rides & handles just fine. For a basic 4x4 under 20 Grand pickup, I don't see how you can beat it. Tight, no rattles, easy to do maintenance, pretty dog-gone good ride. I'm a bear to satisfy...and I'd buy this one again in a second!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this vehicle for about 9 months, put 10600 miles on it so far. And just lost my clutch. Luckily my friend with a ram was following me and could tow me to a safe place. I'm disappointed. EXTREMELY! I had a rav4 before this which had the tranny drop in it. I just figured it was the luck of buying a used car. I bought new this time in hopes that it would be more dependable... not so much. I take long trips and take my truck off road. I can't be breaking down in the middle of no where when i don't have reception. I would suggest the tacoma... but good luck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I finally sold my '91 Toyota Pickup for a new Taco after failing to find a used 4 cyl, manual, 2wd, extended cab one used for anywhere near a reasonable price. My old pickup was still getting 35 mpg highway when I sold it at 160000 miles. But the extra cab space and comfort is great. After almost a year with the new truck I really like this truck. With a camper cap on the bed and at 69 MPH I get a solid 30 MPG on trips. Around home I still get a respectable 25MPG, although I drive with efficiency on my mind. Performance is adequate and the handling is mushy compared to my old Pickup, but the ride is much better and the interior is much more comfortable. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The gas mileage is excellent for a vehicle of this size. The 6'1" bed is important to me as I sleep there camping and on long trips. Most other small pickups have beds an inch or two shorter which is real important if you want to sleep back there.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have recently purchased '08 Prerunner TRD offroad 4 door, and so far I love it. Just replaced a '04 Titan and have gone from about 10 mpg to 19, and kids have more room to boot. I live on a mountain, and travel it, as well as others, everyday. Truck has plenty of power and is averaging 19.8 mpg! This is my first non 4x4 truck, and hoping that the rear locking differential gets me out of those occasional mess ups.

<TEXT>Although a bit pricey, the Tacoma offers reliability, performance, and is economical to operate for a truck. It pulls a load well, within its capability, although fuel mileage suffers with a loaded trailer. When I trade again, I will opt for the longer bed for convenience. I get over 21 MPG with my Tacoma. Some of the increase might be attributable to having a cab high fiberglass topper and a "cat-back" TRD exhaust system along with a K&N air filter. All in all, it's a great truck !</TEXT>

Handled a large 7ft sofa and a tall chest of drawers with a hitch. The area below the dash and the steering column is small for people with large feet. Cabin is a bit noisy at highway speeds when crosswinds are strong. No frt tie-down d-rings as in the rear. HUGE BOO-BOO. The truck drives like a car for comfort on long trips.

<TEXT>I purchased my truck almost 9 months and 10,000 miles ago, and I must say that I am still very happy with it (unlike my last pick-up truck, a which was a 1999 Ford Ranger)! I have driven it between Florida and Upstate New York a number of times, and except for disappointing highway gas mileage (around 18-20 MPG), I generally have no complaints. I bought the truck without the towing package (a $600 dealer option), but I installed a top of the line trailer hitch and wiring for less than $200! I had no problem towing a 5000 lb. boat/trailer! I also didn't get the overpriced TRD option, but the truck is still great off-road! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Toyota Truck, but have owned several Toyota's (I was a Toyota Master Tech years ago). I bought with the SR5 package (which is a MUST), aluminum wheels, and a factory hitch.

<TEXT>The fit and finish is not close to the Toyotas I have owned in the past. I have gap differences of more than 3.2mm side to side. The paint has a lot of "orange peel." Toyota's position is that they are all the same and the Tacomas have "textured paint, since that is the type of paint they use." When was the last time you heard "texture and car paint" used in the same sentence? Make sure you check the fit and finish very carefully before you buy, since Toyota will provide no help after the sale.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this "mini-taco" 03-22-2008 as a way to downsize and conserve. Couldn't be happier with this truck. It is the 4x4 regular cab, the smallest tacoma. What a great design, big on features. Driving mildly, now averaging 23-24 mpg overall. Thats not great but consider its a 4x4. It handles the road much better than the older generation. The steering radius is another pleasant surprise. The performance is better than expected. The 4cyl engine will really move if you want it to. I did get the SR5 package which gives the reg cab truck bucket seats. Very comfortable and supportive. Many cup holders, using the 2 on the rear of the center console for reserve water bottles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent overall styling. The utility features of the bed alone are worth a look.

Had a '90 truck, so the size of this one put me off at first, but I've adapted and my wife has to the creature comforts lacking in the '90, which is the main reason I HAD to get a new truck! We just finished a 1400 mile trip to the Eastern Sierras. A mix of freeway, hills, mountains and dirt roads. As others mentioned, fifth is pretty weak to maintain freeway speeds on steep inclines, so used 4th for that and everything was fine. As for mileage, got 27.2mpg for the entire trip. Think we could beat that on an all freeway trip to LA. Unless you really think you need 4WD, V6,A/T why haul all that extra weight around? At $4.25 a gallon it all adds up.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mileage and the bigger gas tank ('90 was only 10g) allows you to buy at the cheaper stations when you can.The composite bed and cleat system. Plenty of room in the Access Cab to stow stuff with the flip down seats. Plenty of nice features with just the SR5 pkg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got this truck about a week ago after being on deployment in Afghanistan for around 7 months and am loving every second with it. It's fun to drive, and surprisingly good on gas. It's a gorgeous truck, and I have gotten many compliments on it. I got the TRD Sport Package, and the added hood scoop gives the truck a tough, offroad look. The 4 wheel drive is more than capable, and it rides really well on the street. The included Bilstein Suspension, makes potholes and bumps feel pretty much non existent. I don't think I could be more pleased with it, and look forward to driving it for 10 or more years, since of course it is a Toyota.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Where to begin, I got the vehicle fully loaded. I love the look and feel of the steering wheel which is wrapped in leather, along with the shift knob. The convenience of being able to shift into 4 High up to 65 MPH is awesome. And the composite bed and cargo space inside and out is great. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this truck as my 5th Toyota, I've had 2 4Runners, a rav4, and a camry. Not to include my families trucks. I drove 3 different models of Tacoma before purchasing mine, all different engines. I settled with the 6 speed manual. I love it to death. I've had it for six months and have nearly 7000 miles on it. I take it on trips often from Augusta, GA to Conway, AR. It does great! It is amazing off road, better than all the other Toyotas I've driven so far. Handles and climbs great. My dad and uncle went and purchased after me. They have automatics though. They love them.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4x4 switch, radio controls on steering wheel, 6 speed reverse notification (beeps once when in gear as it is by first), cup holders! Storage behind and under the rear seats. Comfortable lumbar support for long drives as I have a bad back. 6 disc cd.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had been looking at trucks for over a year when I finally took the plunge and purchased the Tacoma. It is a great truck for what I need it for. Adequate room for all the stuff I need for work and the children are comfy in the back seat. I added several options to the truck that I felt should almost come as standard features in this day and age (iPod hookup, all weather mats, hands free phone, etc.).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I moved up from my 03 Tacoma 2.4L engine for this one. This truck has all the "bells and whistles" my old truck lacked and I love it so far. Powerful V6 engine, tighter turning radius than my smaller 03 Taco had, smooth shifting automatic. It's very comfortable for me to drive although there seems to be a good amount of wind noise at freeway speeds. Around town it's quiet and seems to be rock solid so far. Keep in mind, I only have about 175 miles so far, but at this point I'm very happy with the truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the hard plastic bed with the awesome cleat tie down system. The 5 spd automatic shifts very smoothly. Lot's of cupholders and storage space. The storage compartments under and behind the rear seats are a nice bonus. Great power and acceleration with the V6 engine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 4th Toyota truck and 2nd 4WD. I traded a 1993 SR5 manual trans in for the 2008 Tacoma with 5 speed auto transmission, due to knee surgery. I had a frontend alignment problem that was finally corrected by the dealership after I complained to Toyota, but they did fix it, under warranty. I have had to haul several loads so far and love the design of the composite bed and the fact I don't need a bed liner. I got the radiant red which is very sharp, the overall truck design is superior to anything else I have seen or checked out. The interior is very roomy and comfortable. I bought new off road floor mats and vent visor's and put a bug shield on too. Plan to keep it along time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Numerous cubby holes for storeage. CD player. Very roomy cab with the suicide doors. Temperature/direction guage is neat. Overall ride is alot smoother than my '93 SR5. I have the TRD Off Road/Tow package too, and have used the 4 wheel drive some without any problems. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Tacoma, but I've been in love with this truck for years. It handles fine for me; it's just a truck, not a sports car. Off-road the truck handles well and performs better, but the stock tires need to go if you plan on doing some serious off-roading. Otherwise, I've been averaging over 20 mpg doing mostly highway driving through the Cumberland mountains (a 4spd automatic might have been a better choice since the 4cylinder needs to be in 4th gear to climb hills on the interstate). The base model comes with no frills, but I can handle crank windows and push mirrors--it's a truck plane and simple.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior looks; they made it huge for a small sized truck! The 4x4 rocks, no hubs to turn on the outside (I guess that's been done away with for a while now). I wish they hadn't changed the front grill though, the older models look meaner from the front.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>There is no position on the heater/AC controls that will shut off outside air from coming in through the vents, which is a problem if you live in a colder climate as I do. The wind noise overpowers conversation and the radio, the wipers make an irritating ?thunk/thunk? noise, and the outside temp/compass indicator is difficult enough to read due to a reflective glare.

<TEXT>I got this little pick up not long ago, I'm still breaking it in and we are getting to know to each other. It is a basic model no power windows, no power locks, no power mirrors. Its an automatic white exterior/ ash interior. I really like the half cab on the back to have all my stuff in it, I'm a big guy and I even fit on the back seat. I really like the dash and the interior looks, it is spacious for a small truck. I was about to get another truck but when I tried this one, I had no choice but to take it. It is simple, reliable so far, and looks sturdy.</TEXT>

The dashboard is very nice in appearance & functioning. The interior is quite roomy, and comfortable. The truck handles well and responds nicely when need be. We purchased the LWB and it is very handsome on the truck. The ride is like you are in a cadillac. This is the only vehicle I've ever had that has the audio controls on the steering wheel and I must say that's a good place for them. I most of all enjoy the fact that I can sit in the driver's seat and reach whatever I need without having to stretch.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have wanted a Toyota truck for some time. I owned other models but never kept them long. The 08 Tacoma is a solid well built truck with all the features I could want. Six speed is fun to drive and gives a little better engine break control in the snow. The TRD package provides some great seats and other features. The truck runs solid if not a little rough but it is a truck and with the bed loaded it smooths out considerably. Mileage is about as expected. The fit and finish is very solid as well. Does not look cheap or cheesy. Overall very happy with my purchase, great financing was offered by toyota as well as other rebate incentives.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went from a 2004 GMC Canyon to my 2008 Toyota Tacoma. Both trucks had the offroad packages. The GMC had a smoother ride on the highway, the toyota is bouncy. Offroad the toyota has the advantage with more ground clearance and absorbs large bumps better. The edge in handling and turning radius goes to the Toyota. Body roll is alot less on the toyota. Fuel economy is only slightly worse on the toyota then the GMC. 20.7MPG Toyota vs. 21.4MPG GMC, in my standard work to home route. Fit and finish on the Toyota are way above the GMC. I would say these trucks are very close, with the edge going to toyota, for better build quality and materials an it's able to tow heavier loads.</TEXT>

Definitely rides like a truck. Very happy with 4x4 performance - safely got me & my friends to the mountain w/o any problems. Double cab rocks. Great engine. Not very comfortable on long highway rides - a 4 hour trip to Boston was not comfortable. A minor complaint: my right toe almost always hits the wiring harness directly above the brack pedal when I switch my foot from gas to brake (size 9.5 boot)...FYI.

<TEXT>I bought this truck new (3 miles on it) one week ago today. Had really been looking at Colorados but after seeing how sharp the black Tacoma w/Rugged Terrain package looked, reading lots and lots of reviews, and doing extensive research, I was hooked. I am glad I spent a couple thousand extra dollars to get too many extra features to count over the competitors, not to mention Toyota reliability. The truck rides smooth, almost like a car, but can turn into a mean mud-flinging machine off road. I have had it in the mud once and I was really impressed with the off-road ability, even in 4x4 high. The 4.0 liter V6 is amazing... extremely powerful throughout the power range, tons of torque.</TEXT>

This is my third Toyota (previous was a 4X2 Hilux and an '03 4X4 Tundra - both were great). Pros - mileage, interior design (esp. leg room) and overall appeal. Good sized back seat for the kids. As much or more interior room as a Honda Civic. On the down side, the truck rides a bit like a truck. Ford and Chev both rode more smoothly. Also, box is pretty tiny, so consider getting the long bed. I went Toyota because, well, it's a Toyota. I'm getting quality and I don't like spending money at the auto shop. VERY happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Time for a new truck. I wanted a reliable, quality pickup with some style that I didn't need a second mortgage to buy. Where to go? Duh... Toyota, of course! The Tacoma is a true mid size pickup, with loads of style and way high on the fun factor. I'm 6'2" and its perfect for me. In fact, its really nice having a smaller truck without hitting my head on the roof. I've heard some complain about the suspension. It's the nicest of any truck I've owned. Tight and true. The interior is attractive and functional, without being expensively gawdy. </TEXT>

The new interior looks more refined. I think the leg room between the front and back seats is smaller than it was on my 03 DC, but that could be the front seats go back farther?

<TEXT>I looked at this and the Frontier. While the Frontier would have been a good 3k cheaper, I like the Tacoma much more. There is nothing not to like. Drives like an SUV but I have a truck bed. Perfect combination.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6 disc changer, comfy seats, power, too many more to count.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2004 Tundra access cab 2wd. I wanted a 4 WD. The new Tundras are too big so I decided on the Tacoma Double cab with Sports package to get the upgraded interior. That upgrade makes for a firmer ride on bumps but rides great on smooth road. It had very quick steering. The seat is a little low. Not as smooth as the 04 Tundra but that should improve. Gas mileage seems better so far. Great looking truck. I get lots of compliments. As years go by I hope it will be refined to the point of the Tundras prior to the new large one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The way it looks. New dash with upgraded interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Tacoma (and following up a bad Chevy experience). Overall I am happy with the truck, it shifts smoothly, has power to go when needed, and it has the options I wanted. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the composite bed, Chevy used to have it as an option, but canned it. I like the tie down system, extra storage pockets, and AC outlet. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second late model Tacoma. The 2.7L-4-cylinder engine performs very strongly, yet returns decent mileage, high 20s. The truck fires off with the ignition so quickly, barely hear the starter. I own a base Tacoma with automatic as the only option. The only option I wish I would've gotten was cruise-control, other than not having that, its a perfect truck without flaws. I would recommend it to a friend.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Reliability, inexpensive, good looks, strong performance, and very comfortable, will haul 1,000 pounds without a problem, and the composite inner bed.</FAVORITE>
