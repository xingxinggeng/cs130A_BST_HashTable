<TEXT>Hello, The C30 is a marvelous little car. Those who currently own a Honda Civic and are interested in moving to the Accord would do good to test drive a C30. I have always preferred smaller cars and traded in my 1997 Civic EX Coupe with 197k on the odometer. Unfortunately Honda hasn't made any youth oriented (and purchased by youth) cars in over 10 years. Instead of waiting for the CRZ I purchased C30 instead. The build quality is far superior to the Honda Civic. You feel very safe as soon as you shut the door. The engine has great torque. You can drive around town in 4th gear from 15-50 mph without a problem. If the price is too high buy a used one and you will not regret it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Short and squat design with sport suspension keeps you glued to the road. Numerous safety features like 7+ air bags. Three different electronic stability control features. The manual Transmission has enough torque to start in 1st or 2nd gear with no throttle input.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has awful wind noise over 40 MPH. I have had the doors adjusted, seals replaced and the noise seems to get worse. I can only turn the radio up so loud. Before you buy check out a volv c30 users forum- it is the #1 problem. Volvo seems quiet on the subject, but it seems to be a design flaw. And I have had it aligned more times (at the dealership and not under warranty) than I think is necessary (3) and it still has a tremendous amount if road noise. It is fixed when I first get it back, but after 5,000 miles out it goes again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car in Aug 2008. The 2009s had been released and I got a killer deal. I as replacing an 11yo Honda Civic with suspension upgrades that I *loved*. I did not think I could find a car to replace the Civvie. I really wanted an A4 Avant with manual (good luck finding one) but wound up x-shopping the A3, GTI, Mazda 3, Focus and Impreza. I have drove them all. The C30 was the best package for me. We have a two year old daughter but we also run a Mazda CX9. I only needed marginal utility. The C30 has just enough. (I recently took a road trip to hike the Grand Canyon. Three guys, full packs/gear.) The C30 is a superb touring car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, Acceleration, uniqueness. Hatchback space. The Dynaudio stero is superb. Seats are comfortable all day long.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my Volvo three months ago and find myself driving around town and listening to music, not going anywhere. I love the ride and the feel and the super good looks. So many people have commented on it! I get 26 mpg around town with an automatic. I am shorter than average and thought I needed to sit high to see well, but the C30 is positively panoramic. I feel great about my choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2008 C30 T5 with geartronic auto is still doing well. it has 14,000 miles on it. I love the performance. I get approx 22 mpg combined (mostly city & little highway) and 29 mpg highway on long trips. I still don't see many on the road in southern california, but that makes it even more cool! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2005 Toyota Scion TC and said I would NEVER get anything but a toyota ever. WELL, I saw the C30, test drove it, fell in love and signed that day. It was one of those vehicles that you cant wait to get ahold of. Had a slight problem with the window gear but it was fixed right away. I feel safe and secure while driving and can "beat" most any car that even dares to try and race me :) It's small, unique, cute, fast and reliable. Every where I go, people ask what I'm driving and want a ride. I feel amazing knowing I haven't seen one of the C30's on the road since I first noticed them back in January!! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The dash containing the radio and the open back is quite original. I love looking at the outside of the car. Most people assume I spent about 35,000. they cant believe i got ALL that for 25,000!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my car a little bit over a year now and still love it. Very fun to drive and has the power to overtake other cars if ever needed. The suspension is a bit stiff but handles very well. The styling is one of the main reasons I bought the car. Its unique, sporty, and classy all in one. A real eye catcher. Its nice to have a car that you don't see at every other stop light. My small list of gripes for this car is: 1. The passenger side seatbelt rattles a bit when driving. 2. At times would like to have more trunk room. But i just fold my rear seats down normally if i need more space. 3. Would be nice to have the trip computer come standard instead of having to pay extra for it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The styling, engine, and available accessories. If you ever get bored w/ it, there are plenty of aftermarket vendors that make various of parts and accessories for the car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought this on the Factory Delivery, plan and my wife was nervous about driving through Norway, so I got the pleasure. Lots of power and sharp handling, especially around the mountains. You can drive under all conditions for long periods without aches or fatigue. Mileage is decent at 25 overall with auto. Great visibility too. It drives at up to 80 mph with no perception of being pushed at all - the speed control wife didn't even know to tell me to slow down.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning a Ford Focus and a Pontiac Vibe, this is by the best hatchback I have owned. I fell instantly in love with the unique design the moment I saw at an auto show. Anyone who loves attention will love this car, I couldn't count how many times people stop me to ask me about my car plus the looks, stares, and pointing. I've only had one issue so far. The shifter would bind up, but it was covered by warranty and its been smooth ever since. Acceleration is great, handling is superb, interior is simple and comfortable, MPG is nothing too spectacular but still good. Also, it handles decently in the snow, but in SE PA we never really get that much snow anyway.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The turbo, Tire Pressure Monitoring System (Volvo's is actually worth it), heated seats (once you have them you never go back), stability control, aux jack for iPod</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned this car for 8000 miles now. I wanted to get in some seat time and see how the car would responed to my new born daughter and her car seat before I write a review. Volvo has indeed out done itself. From the ordering process to the driving experience(minus the build time). I was hooked the second I jumped in and cranked the key. My wife and I were worried about our daughters car seat. We have a Graco rear facing seat with the quick release base. I have only two complaints about this. One, is that you have to move the seat forward in order for it to fit. Luckily for my wife she is small. The second is locking of the seat after I put the car seat in or out of the car</TEXT>

<TEXT>Volvo has outdone itself in the styling department. I get people coming up to me all the time asking what I am driving and how do I like it? I have nothing but praise for this car from a person who has owned three Volvos of old and a Mercedes before this wonderful example of Scandinavian design. The Version 1 comes standard with a lot of features so I really did not feel the need to add anything much extra. Driving this car is a blast with great power. Get the manual transmission. You won't be sorry. And the whirling sound of the inline 5 turbo is fantastic. The build quality is on par with the competitors and the structure is as stiff as the old Mercedes, maybe better. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love everything about this car. It turns heads and brings you home safe. Nice to see Volvo has maintained it's standard for body rigidity, functionality and saftey while posibbly designing the best looking Volvo ever to exist on the face of the earth. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded a Focus and Sky and got the best of both worlds- the functionality of the Focus and nearly the power of the Sky Turbo. I call it my "hybrid". The fit and finish is a real step up. Of all the small luxury vehicles the C30 is the best choice- more stylish and sportier than the A3 and much more roomy than the Mini. As far as the other small vehicles like the Civic, Corrola, etc. they cannot even start to compare.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 6-speed manual is the way to go for power and performance.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased my C30 OSD in Mar, picked it up & drove it in Sweden over Memorial Day and picked it up again in Tampa in July. The car is a stunner and draws rave reviews from folks, especially the younger crowd, but plenty of wiser enthusiasts have forced me to chat with them about it. The turbo comes on smooth and fast. Going 115 in this car is like going 30 in my great ZTW. Real easy to bust way over the speed limit, if you don't pay attention. Mine is in matte Gold, which the factory said there were not many made, and supposedly that's the only car Volvo makes that you can get in matte gold (?) </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Slaying Mustangs at stop lights. Handles as good as my old GTI. Quiet. HP sound system is awesome. Sirius sat radio is great. Cool trip computer. I think I have the only matte gold C30 in America!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the solid "thunk" sound when a door closes. The rear seats are hard to get into, but with them down, the back is suprising roomy. Yes, it will run on either premium, regular or I guess "mid-grade". For your 1st 1000 miles, get a full featured premium. Then after, you can use regular for getting around town or Premium if you want performance. This car has plenty of ooomph. Unless you are street racing you don't need more. It manuevers like a dream. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance, fun to drive, solid feel. Head-turning looks. Price. Many nooks and crannys to store stuff. Full size spare. I have only had mine a while, so reliability rating is only for the 1st few 1000 miles. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Terrific car. Went in to replace my 2001 Cross Country with the new model, wasn't crazy about the feel, and ended up testing the C-30. Can't believe I went from all that space to this 2-dr hatchback. What a good decision. With the back seats down, I can put my golf clubs, my wife's golf clubs and all the luggage we would ever need for a long trip. Comfort, ride, sound, all spectacular, and you gotta love the BLIS - no more neck craning to find that truck hidden in my blind spot. In my travels on the east and west coasts and the south, I have yet to see another C-30 on the road, so the uniqueness is a plus as well. People do stare. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my C30 in December and after 9 months I wanted to provide a followup to my first review. I'm still impressed with its performance, handling, and overall feel. More than a few times I've needed the quick acceleration and my C30 has delivered without fail. Almost all my miles are city and zip around with a fairly heavy foot so I've been getting around 20 mpg. I'm sure I could get better if I were more conservative but thats not my style. If I had it to do over again would I buy the Volvo C30? Yes indeed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Initially I said the interior design was my favorite feature but after 9 months it has to be the drivers seat. Perfect driving position for me and it's very comfortable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>You Americans always make me laugh when mumbling and complaining about fuel economy and car prices. I have one of the first C30's diesel available (July 2007) 1.6 summum, 110 Hp, 0-100 (km) 10s, top speed 195km/h List price 30.000,- Euro, is like 45.000 US dollars. Diesel per liter euro 1,50, is like US dollar 2,25 The comfort and handling are great. For the US market I would suggest the 2.0 diesel (136 Hp) or the D5, (165- 180 Hp) Why not try diesel instead of petrol. In Europe a petrol car is almost a sin. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my C30, with automatic geartronic trans, for about a month now. The acceleration is incredible and the shifting is smooth. It can orner at a fairly fast speed and stay in control. I tinted the rear hatch window and the two rear passenger fixed windows with a dark tint. I tinted the two roll-up windows with a lighter tint and the car looks even more cool now. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Picked up my C30 after my 2007 S40 was totaled by a drunk driver (luckily I wasn't). The cars styling is so unique and the T5 engine smooth as can be (much smoother and more responsive than the 2.4i in the S40). It's a shame that the fuel efficiency isn't as good as what one might hope, but it is still acceptable considering the performance and overall package. Another negative for some might be the small and rather high opening of the hatch. The C30 is more of a looker hatch than one you would want to haul stuff around in. Just keep that in mind and you won't be disappointed. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Incredibly supportive seats and powerful, responsive engine. Very precise steering as well. Killer looks that are fresh and unique amidst all of the clones.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Excellent car, handles like a dream, gets off the line fairly quickly. It could use some extra torque though, and you should do everything in your power to stay away from potholes (I cringe at the slam of my 18 inch wheels over concrete expansion joints), but luckily with its superb handling, you can avoid them without difficulty. The sound system is unreal, the car is just one huge menu system. Everything can be changed, adjusted, and tweaked to your exact specifications. I wish the front didn't look exactly the same as the S40 and V50, but it's a small price to pay for having the coolest car around.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The C30 handles beautifully. Fast. Super zippy! I live in Los Angeles, where quick acceleration is part of the traffic landscape. The design of the C30 is purely amazing! Also, many people are under the impression that this vehicle costs more than 40k. These things matter to a 40 yr old like me..</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car after looking at a SRT4 Caliber and a Mazda Speed 3. I was just about set on the Mazda when I found this car by accident, as soon as I saw it and started researching it was a done deal without the test drive. Then I drove it...wow! This car is probably one of the most well balanced cars I have ever owned..even better than a BMW! I have no faults with this car whatsoever from an engineering perspective. The power, handling, comfort and design of the car are all superb! Once I drove it I was done..no need to drive anything else because nothing else compares. I actually can't wait to take it on a long trip.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Inline 5 cyl turbo engine, memory foam seats, legroom in back seats, unigue styling, upgraded stereo and smooth/quite ride. Chances are you will not see another C30 like yours, or see another one period. The cool factor of this car is off the charts, this is one cool Volvo!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this car the minute it came out in October. I have put 17,000 miles on the car and have driven it across country 3 times. I was disappointed that cruise control was not standard but I added it for 250 dollars after my first cross country trip. It has been extremely reliable and handles beautifully. It handles mountain roads smoothly and never loses acceleration no matter what the grade is. It is extremely comfortable and spacious and I have sat in it for 12 hours at a time. It also has amazing cargo capacity once seats are folded down. My only problem is that ulphostery beneath the glove compartment did come undone but it was easily repaired. </TEXT>

For just 1 day of rain, storm and a lil snow huu surprise!, when I open the the door water was all over my seats, take note both driver side and passenger side, so instead of enjoying the car, the mechanics are enjoying it at the dealer trying to find out where the leak is coming from so basically perfect for a car under 30g. </TEXT>

She can take off like a space rocket, especially going uphill, pushing me back into the seat. It makes me laugh right out loud--as does the incredible sound system! The BLIS system is very useful, as are the front and rear fog lights. The backseat is suprisingly roomy. Overally, I'm very happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got the car last week. I love it, it is so much fun to drive. I also love that you don't see many on the street so you find people looking at your car wondering what it is. It has the perfect balance of a sports car and yet keeps the sophisticated feel of a Volvo. Much better buy than other cars in its class such as the volvo GTI, Civic SI, Mazda Speed 3, or Mini Cooper S. Test drove the rest and thought this one was the best choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle was acquired in Jan 08. The worst winter in recent times for Michigan soon made it painfully obvious that the high performance Pirelli Rosso tires are not proper for locales that receive any measureable amount of snow. These tires immediately become road slicks and the vehicle will go nowhere. On dry or wet pavement, they are outstanding. Potholes are deadly for any tire, but for these Pirellis, it is certain immediate bankruptcy! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Oh what fun it is to ride... knowing you're surrounded by all those safety features! Had the C30 for a month and love it. The seats are unbelievably comfy and the front legroom is spacious (if no one is in the back seat). If you have a dog check to see if he can get climb up the hatch because is quite high off the ground. Power and handling are super. Engine and transmission feel responsive yet flexible; can shift from 2nd straight to 6th gear on freeway, no problem. Clutch is easy to push, won't fatigue leg. Stock stereo is powerful and has aux input for any mp3 player. Cabin storage a little tight but helps with clutter. Altogether a nice car, I'm very happy with my purchase. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Compact size, easy to park. Stereo system is fantastic (stock). Seats are great, manual even better than electric (too slow for rear access). Doors are HUGE for easy entry/exit (but heavy). Center "floating" console too cool for words and easy to use. Power is clearly there when you need it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car mainly because no other car looks like it and it has the power when you need it. I test drove several other cars but this one just got me from the first drive. I am 38 years old with a wife and 2 kids. I did not want the boring family car or the SUV. The wife has the SUV so we take her truck when we go out or travel. I travel about 70-100 miles per day so I need a car with good gas mileage. I am getting over 25 miles on mixed driving which is good for a turbo car. Volvo wanted a car where the consumer can customize the car with the options you want. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I haven't had this much fun with a car since I traded in my '72 Volvo 144 for a 1982 Rabbit. Acceleration in 3rd gear pushes me back in the seat and I'm practically giggling when I have the excuse to lean on the gas to merge onto the highway. Once there, it's incredibly quiet, 6th gear keeps the revs down, and handling is reliable and predictable. I got the non-sports (1.0) model and the ride is very comfy. This car is great. It's got the original tires which aren't great in snow, but they're not bad either. Mileage depends on how you drive (duh). I can push it some and still get the 20 mpg the EPA promises. I've only had it for 1000 miles; I'm infatuated.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted something fun, but not one of the Racer Boy cars. I have kids, but I'm more likely to be alone and take the wife's VW Passat with the family. This car just FIT. Excellent fuel economy, power when you want it, and space to take things. Can even tow or mount stuff on the roof if needed. Interior is very unique. Some buttons take some getting used to, but overall a really nice stylish design. I like the two rear seats as they didn't try to squeeze in 3. Access with manual seats is great. Comfort is good as long as you put the short people in back. Volvo seats just seem to fit really nice for the long haul. Even the carpet in the back doesn't seem to be a dog hair magnet.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine - torque from 1500 rpm. Seats, great cloth and comfort. Visibility - what blind spot? Handling - tires grip great and suspension allows fun while still being comfy. 60" of cargo with seats down - fit more than I thought. All kinds of tech available. Regular maint is fairly easy for DIY.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I spent many hours on the internet and many weeks preparing to buy this car. Our family has a minivan and needs an Accord but this car won me over big time. There are many practical reasons to get a Honda, but the C30 adds so much to my driving experience while maintaining a sense of class that it became a perfect fit. I am 40, but not ready to drive a 40 year old no matter how much "sense" it makes. The C30 has a simple but well built and easy to use interior. The exterior styling is very unique. The T5 mated to the MT is the way to go. Almost got the AT at wife's request but the MT was too fun to drive and brought the car to life even more. Chose the 2.0 for styling and audio reasons.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I read all the reviews and test drove several small hatchbacks before selecting the Volvo C30 (with only one option - automatic transmission). The C30 standard features met all my other requirements. Overall, it cost less than the Audi A3, has more comfort than the Volkswagon GTI, and enough power to compete with both. Personally I don't like to "feel the road" as much as some, and I enjoy the unique styling. The C30 is a nice blend of sportiness and comfort at a reasonable price. One added benefit is the fact you don't see many of them on the road (yet) so it stands out in the crowd.</TEXT>

<TEXT> It gets a lot of looks! It gets up and goes as soon as you get around 3500 RPM. I'm use to cars with much larger engines however this car motors effortlessly without much engine noise. The controls are easy to manage and the upgraded sound system is great! A must have! The only one thing I dislike is that you feel every bump in the road. Otherwise great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I considered buying Impreza WRX or Mazda Speed3, have driven both. The Volvo really matches my style of driving, low RPM with a lot of torque, firm and comfortable suspension. I love interior, and exterior. Built quality is very good, audio and driving experience is amazing. I do really recommend this car for your consideration. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is great. It zips around like a sportster, while being extremely comfortable, smooth riding and safe. It has average acceleration and fuel economy if you accelerate at 2,500 - 3,000 rpms. But hammer down the gas pedal and at 5,000 - 5,500 rpms you are getting a thrust of acceleration. Of course that thrust comes at a price of lower fuel economy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is the perfect blend of styling, performance, safety and utility. The car has power when I need it (turbo engine), a hatchback for carrying cargo, all the Volvo safety features, and all the while looking great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>227 hp turbo engine, stereo, safety features, automatic wipers and heated seats. Everything basically!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking at the Mazdaspeed3 and while searching the internet, the C30 came up. I went to the local Volvo dealership and the test drive changed my mind. The car is fast, smooth, and well built. This car rides like a luxury car until you press on the accelerator and that's when the car reveals the power within. Gas mileage is good unless you have a habit of flooring the pedal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The style, performance, gas mileage, in other words I love all the features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is solid and smooth. The performance is pretty good. Gas mileage is excellent. I love the fact that you can cruise and it feels like it's bigger than it is, however as you press on the pedal the car responds.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride quality, interior and exterior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car. It flys on the highway and responds at the low speeds too. I had the sales guy hanging on for dear life while I ran through the gears! The kicker for this car is that it can pull 2000 lbs, so my jet ski will now tour the country with me!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the styling of the front of the car and the horsepower for the money.</FAVORITE>
