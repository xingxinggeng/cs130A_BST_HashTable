<TEXT>Wife wanted one. I drive it on weekends and have taken it on a few road trips. Other car is V6 Accord and until Prius were always Honda people. When we bought the Prius, we gave 03 Civic Hybrid to one of our kids. Typical Toyota steering feel, soft, unlike the Hondas so many of us like. Beyond that, great car. Unbelievably spacious, excellent sound system, runs very well at highway speeds, and gets very good gas mileage. I check mpg manually with regularity. The gauge mpg readout can be right on, or off as much as 5% high or low. Same with Civic but not as bad. Have gotten as much as 53 on highway, typically 41-43 in mixed, lower in dead of winter. Would not hesitate to buy another one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the most remarkable car I have ever owned. It is economical, roomy, comfortable (I am 6'2" and have heard about how it doesn't fit tall people. Nonsense!), and fun to drive. I love the fact that it delivers great economy without producing tons of emissions while at the same time it is quick off the mark and able to climb mountains without hesitation (I have also heard about its supposed defects in this regard). I replaced the tires with Michelin Energy Savers A/S and saw the economy jump nearly 9%. I highly recommend those tires.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, reliability, economy. I regularly get upwards of 52 mpg all around.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Within months of purchase my wife and I drove to Western Montana (over the continental divide) and back to Minnesota. We got 53 MPG at a time when gas was about $4.00 a gallon. Extraordinary! There's plenty of room inside, but I do not like the touch screen -- you can't see it in bright sunlight. I'm glad they got rid of it (for the most part) in the new ones. I wouldn't trade this car for any other on the road. It's the best car I have ever owned. I disagree with those who find it slow off the mark. It has plenty of get up and go.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Since purchasing this car we have had difficulty filling the gas tank. It continually cuts off and just keeps clicking off before we can complete filling the tank. Finally the tank was replaced but we still have the problem. What is the problem. Never had this problem with any other car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Prius just before the economy crashed. Don't drive it in the winter as it takes forever to warm up and won't keep ice or snow buildup off the windshield. I'm concerned about comments on quitting for no reason and dead battery. I stored mine last winter and started it every couple of weeks with no problems. But didn't get it out until March. Mileage goes south when weather is cold. So I just drove my Pickup beginning in late Nov. until March. Also noted that tire wear is excessive. They must have used a cheap tire as OEM. Wouldn't buy another as insurance is high and needing a different vehicle for the seasons defeats economy of transportation. It's built well though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have a company car also, so whenever I don't drive the Prius for ten days, I find a dead battery! I've used up my AAA for the year already, and have an expensive repair ($120) from trying to open the back hatch- you are completely locked out! No one ever warned us about this! Don't go on vacation w/o getting your car a babysitter!! Also, I want to complain about an irritating design feature: when driving at night, there is a bad glare, a green bar of reflection onto the windshield right where you look to drive from the the display! If the top frame of it was extended a little, like a hood, it wouldn't happen. And I can't fix it. Same problem in the daytime, gps screen needs shade- bleached out.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>GPS very good but you can't see it in the daytime without shading it, also, passenger can't find things while we're driving due to lockout safety. Bummer.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a 2007 Prius which got 47 to 53 mpg. This car was totaled and I was so happy with the car itself and then definitely the safety features. I purchased a 2008 Prius and now only get 36 to 43 mpg. I have been to a local dealer to no avail and I am heading to the dealership where I bought the car today. Leaving on big road trip in September, I hope they can do something!! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like everything about the car except the mileage and the fact that they can't add Mexico to the GPS. The update costs for GPS is prohibitive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I own a Prius for more than 18 months now. It's a fun car to drive with great fuel economy. The only thing that bothers me is how safe I am in this car. Had met with 2 accidents and the car got damaged badly in both. Luckily I was alone in the car on both the occasions. The body is not strong. A simple hit can cause bumps. Just wonder, is economy that better than the safety!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had done so much research on the Prius that I was totally confident in my purchase. I have been so disappointed in some of the design features. The rear window is difficult to see out of because of a bar running horizontally across ... the dash dims when the headlights are turned on, making it difficult to see how fast you are going, and the dash is difficult to see in bright sunlight. The car salesman raved about the new seat fabric, but it is already stained. I would have preferred leather, but was talked out of it. Of course, the gas mileage can't be beat, but it's a shame the other elements don't measure up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2008 metalic red prius 5-20-08 with only 5miles on the odometer. My first 100 miles city driving I'm averaging 51.5 mpg. This car is by far the best valued auto. The car is very roomy with a lot of leg room front and back. The seats are very comfortable and a lot of storage. My only complaint is that there is no compass on the mirror which I had on my Saturn 3-Ion which I traded for the Prius. However- I love-love- the Prius. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have just over 300 miles on the car. I got 54 MPG (calculated from fillout to fillup at the pump - not the car computer) from St. George, UT back to Las Vegas (about 120 miles one way) at 65 MPH. This is slightly downhill back home. I have on it 17 inch G-Games wheels and Michelin 225/17 tires. I thought I would dress up the car a little, but also thought I might take a slight hit on MPG - LOVE the wheels/tires - don't forget to reset the tire pressure monitoring system. The dealer said you have to have about 2,000 mile on the car before it really breaks in and you get the best MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Compared to my new '06 Honda Civic Hybrid my new '08 Pkg 2 Prius is wonderful. I dumped the '06 HCH after just 5 months I've had this Toyota now 6 months and 19,000 miles. Handles like a real car while the Civic didn't. The Prius is a great all-around solid and upright car. Fuzzy beige cloth gets nasty if you drive a lot like me. Overall, kudos to Toyota. I get 43 mpg at 80 mph freeway speeds and 59 to 61mpg running it at 55 mph on state highways with 48 mpg overall avg so far.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Super MPG. Fabulous resale value. Upright seating positions and comfy for 4 adults. Fold-down rear seats reveal a flat floor to the back of the car for great carrying capacity. Handles better than expected for a state-of-the art aero chassis/body package riding on low rolling resistance tires.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased this car May 13th, and hve not had one bit of regret! This car has proven to be the most valuable purchase we have ever made! We have only had it for a couple of days, but it outperforms anything we have ever driven before. It holds the road perfectly! Standing water in the street does not grab the wheel, hard blowing wind does not knock you off the road! My husband is disabled and finds it not only easy to get in and out of, but to ride in, he does not complain as he did with other cars we have owned or have tried out. Our teenaged daughter sits behind and reports it to be a very comfortable car to ride in. She got to drive it and loved the way it handles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a 2008 Prius 3 weeks ago. In most respects it has far exceeded my expectations. The fit and finish is first rate. It is comfortable for 4 real adults to sit in. The leather is quite nice and comfortable. The bluetooth works very well. As for mileage, I have 900 miles on the car. I live in the country where there are lots of hills. This past week I had to drive for 5 days between liberty and poughkeepsie, ny for a distance of 57 miles. My average mpg was 56 (no B.S.). After 400 miles I put 7 gals. of gas in the tank. It is quiet with no wind noise from the windows. The car does things that no other car does. The nav is good although I like the software on my honda pilot better. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th Prius. Started in 05 and traded every year since (I used to drive Marquis). Trade in value excellent, my mileage usually ranges between 44 - 46 mpg calculating miles driven divided by # of gallons (the display on all 4 I've owned is a little optimistic). It holds the road great and has enough get up and go when you need it to get on highways, etc. I wish it had a moonroof option but as far as performance - I'll put my Prius up against any other compact car in it's class - and alot of intermediate size cars too. Comfortable enough for long trips - but remember this is an "on road" vehicle. Can't pull itself out of much of anything but on asphalt it's the best in the world.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy, insurance savings, low emissions, bluetooth (though it drops from time to time), Smart Key, safety rating, back up camera, re-sale/trade value (incredible) and all the little cubby holes to stash stuff. Getting nearly 500 miles on a tank of gas is a great feature too!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been a proud Prius owner for two weeks and I can honestly say this is the best car I have ever owned. I love the way you can monitor how your car is utilizing its energy. I still need some work with my city driving since I'm "only" getting 42.0 mpg vs 48.0 for mixed/highway. It's also quiet and fun to drive. With gas prices over $4.00 a gallon in CA, I don't understand why anyone would buy any other car. My husband is now shopping around for his own Prius.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a performance luxury sedan (of the 3-letter ilk) expecting to make concessions in reducing my carbon footprint. I found that this vehicle, while not as zippy or cornering-agile, was as comfortable, spacious, and amenity-rich (Package #6) as any of my previous vehicles. It also boasts the best MPG (49 Hwy, 46 Cty) of any of my previous vehicles including my beloved Honda CRX in the 80s. As oil approaches $200/barrel, the demand for the Prius will increase and it will hold its value longer, adding to its appeal. I enjoy driving it more than any other car I've had (and I?ve owned 25!). I remain excited to see the next model which I hope will include the improvements below.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Eco-friendly and a revolutionary social impact from the auto sector. This car makes an historic statement. Incredible space considering the unassuming size. Fold-down seats provide ample room for hauling large items. Back-up camera. Incomparable MPG unless you opt for a $100K Tesla. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Very helpful dealership. I went to them just because our son was looking at trading in his Toyota pickup for the new model. My husband ask me to look at a car he had seen in the lot. I got inside, and was surprised at the leg room. So we asked to take it out on a test drive. It was everything consumers reported and more. Great pickup, and maneuverability. It passes out vehicles who think it is small, and therefore not fast. Cars hugging my back end are left in the dust. Took it to bar harbor Maine, and used only 4 tenths of a tank of gas. When we are ready to trade in, we will get another. It is the best vehicle we've owned in 48 and 1/2 years of marriage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle in March 2008. I really liked the Prius after renting one from Hertz for a week. MPG ranged from 44 lowest to 59 the highest. I purchased model 1224-base with Package#2 and factory installed leather-LA90 option. The leather seats offer great support, and are very comfortable. The car has good pick-up especially when merging on the interstate. I'm sorry I waited so long to make the purchase, even though I was able to buy under MSRP.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We are very happy with our decision to buy a Prius. It was an expensive jump up in cost for our limited budget, but it will be worth it. They have a great resale value and that helps a lot. The electric steering is reassuringly precise and solid; I love it that way. The car is tight and has a very solid feeling. Lots of room + lots of cargo potential. The rear seats are a breeze to flip down, even from the back end of the car. It's built on the Camry chassis!</TEXT>

<TEXT>First of all, let's get past the looks! I was put off for over a year before buying solely because I wasn't thrilled about the exterior looks. You get over that as soon as you drive it. The interior is very roomy and comfortable. Just close the door and you can feel the Toyota quality. I was surprised at the actual acceleration, as much as I will ever need. The technology is very different and takes some getting used to. After 2 months I still find myself reaching for a gear shift lever to put it in park! The glare on the front window can be eliminated by simply turning down the dashboard dimmer switch a little. Practice backing with an empty trash can behind you. Stop waiting! Buy it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smart key allows the key to remain in your pocket. Roominess. I have hauled a few 8 foot boards in it, but don"t tell my wife! Consumption monitor is fun and entertaining and helps improve gas mileage. Decent 6 disc cd changer. cold weather driving gets 43 mpg, currently averaging 50 mpg, honestly! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car in April and I love it. I didn't want a hybrid at all, but my husband pressured me to at least look at it and I fell in love with it. It is so fun to drive! And I am addicted to watching my mileage on that display screen. After driving it for three weeks, I have really learned how to "drive smart" to save gas. It's cute and sexy all at the same time, with plenty of room for my two year old and all his gear. He keeps asking if he can watch Elmo on the touch screen. Sorry buddy, this is mommy's car! I love to make fun of my friends who are getting 12 mpg in their SUVs. Purchasing a Prius is a no-brainer in this day and age of high gas prices. No regrets!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I decided to go "green," but was not all that excited about the Prius. But I've been more than pleasantly surprised. The leather seating is a nice touch and the interior is very spacious and comfortable. The electronic controls (radio, climate, etc.) are outstanding, much better than those offered by the German automakers. And performance-wise, the car has some kick. No, it's not a BMW but it's not slow and I really enjoy driving it. The only negative I can think of is that the car is so light that when it's very windy and you're on the highway, you can really feel it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My new Prius is now two weeks old and has 700 miles on it. What a great car! Incredibly quiet, even when the gas engine kicks in. I am already getting over 50 MPG with a car that has plenty of zip when you want it. I am most impressed with the interior room and the seamless operation of the power train. The CVT is very smooth and quiet in its operation. After reading other reviews I was concerned the seats might be uncomfortable but have not found this to be the case. Very good back support. My wife feels the ride is choppy compared to the Chrysler van we have been driving but under most road conditions it is fine. I must admit I am finding excuses to go places in it!</TEXT>

I am 6'2 230 and have adequate room, total volume is more than adequate. Gas mileage after 3000+ is over 50 best was 57.3 worst 43.8 (was driving it like my vette... fast). Mostly highway driving, very smooth surprising power. We are educating ourselves how to get good mileage with the consumption readout. This car is FUN to drive, fun to own, safe with all the safety features, helps the environment by reducing emissions and fuel useage. We figure in 2 years it will pay for itself.

We have gotten 53.7 mpg on the first fill up and haven't really fully learned how best to manage the gas pedal! We chose a package #2 vehicle and had it sent out to be fitted with the leather interior. We have spent most of the past 25 years driving european cars, many which were BMW and Volvos. No one would confuse the Prius with the aforementioned but the build quality, materials, ride, design and technology are exceptional. We couldn't be happier. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When gas prices hit 4 bucks a gallon in San Francisco area, that was it. Bye bye Lexus, Hello Prius. Since I am a Lexus owner, was already familiar with Toyota build and quality. I learned to drive without the lead foot and after a week, I am still at 51 mpg. It is important to use the cruise control when trying to coax a few more mpg on the freeway. My wife and I find the car very fun to drive. We look at the energy and the consumption gauges frequently and try to stay over 50 MPG. Love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>You really have to drive one to believe it. We were looking to buy the 2009 Corolla but after driving both, the Prius was the clear choice for us. We are averaging 48.34 mpg and what a fun little car to drive. We took a 160 mile round trip on the 2nd day we had it and were very pleased with the comfort and performance on the open road. If you are looking for a gas saver be sure to test drive one before buying a gas powered sub compact, and compare total cost to own and warranty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Over all an excellent car as Toyota is famous for. Now that gas prices are sky-rocketing, it has begun to pay off in mileage. We traded a 2001 Grand Prix GTP supercharged sedan for the Prius. Our gas expense has now gone from close to $400 down to about $115 a month. That is substantial.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been averaging 50 MPG in my first week of ownership, driving on the Grand Parkway/I-10/Beltway 8. The car does not handle as a peppy Corolla, but has more passenger room. The cargo space is not as big as a Corolla, but adequate to haul the weekly groceries. Be sure to buy "vehicle shield" or the road noise will get to you. As a techno-geek, I enjoy driving the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I don't usally write reviews but I felt I needed to write this one. I've owned this car a week so I've still got new car fever. I've been driving a Ford Supercrew for 7 years so going to a Prius was a new view on the world to say the least. If you are a big vehicle driver you need to check this car out... no regrets. My 2 kids have enough room in the back even with me (6'1" 220 lbs) in the driver's seat. We all have room to spare. My wife and I find ourselves fighting over who gets the car. Our first tank of gas got 46.7 MPG and we are doing even better on our 2nd. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It has been like a new toy, fun to drive. On 2 trips to Columbus we averaged close to 53 mpg. It seems like a much bigger car when driving. We hit a snow storm once and it handled great traveling on highways with a lot of snow. We like the touch screen for operating much on the car extras, plus what you can also operate from the stearing wheel. We have the new blue color and really get the compliments on the color. We are very happy that we bought it, and especially now with the price of gas.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In addition to the awesome mileage (avg 47 mpg!), we are impressed with the smooth and very quiet ride. The Prius has lots of room inside; it is great as a commuter and is superb on long trips. We find ourselves cruising at 80 mph before we realize it. We enjoy watching the dash display switch from gas to electric engine and we really enjoy watching only the battery work when we are sitting in traffic. The CVT takes some getting used to and can be annoying sometimes, but we don't mind anymore. If you purchase the nav system, ask about the cost of map updates; it is set by the dealer. Overall we love this car... it is a great car to "go green" in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Prius for just over 3 months now. It's a great car! It's not going to win any races, but that's not why I bought it. It's does not handle like a BMW, but that's not why I bought it. It's comfortable for me to drive, I like the features (Bluetooth, nav + little extras you get) and it's great on gas mileage. It's not going to be for everyone, but it's the right car for me at this point in my life - just over 50! Want a practical car, the the Prius - but know the limitations before you buy - else you may be unhappy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>B/T, nav, voice recog is great! "Gas Stations" and it displays them all with symbols! You can program in maintenance info. Simple to change oil, which I do myself.

<TEXT>I have had the car for 2 months. I bought it as an investment against the rising gas prices. I believe this car is a better city commuter and I use another car for longer distances. I am averging 44 mpg but do take to the highways at 70+ mph. The turning radius is exceptional. The speedometer is set much further out than a normal car, meaning that you can see it and the road without much eye movement. Cruise control is a good way to save gas. You get used to saving more gas by being aware of how you are using your gas and what action will burn more or less. Large cargo area. Get the 16" tires on the Touring Model. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just recently purchased my Prius used with 6000 miles. Here is a little information I haven't seen. Toyota gives you a slightly better warranty on a used vehicle than on a new one. Mine went to 7 yrs, 100,000 miles. If you try the standard model and are not satisfied with the ride or handling, try the touring model. I had decided not to buy the Prius as I had taken it at a high rate of speed over rough road. The dealer said to take the touring model over the same road. It felt like a different car. Wife's opinion also. The only thing I don't like are the super bright headlights. They can't seem to regulate them. I told them if they can't, to put standard lights in. We just love this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We didn't purchase the Prius because of its fuel economy, but that was a factor. We actually selected it because we liked the car best. It looks small from the outside but feels bigger on the inside. This is a new type of driving experience, not just another car. Toyota really put a lot of thought into the technology and features of this car. We purchased package #2 which includes the smart key but not the GPS or blue tooth voice control feature. Quiet ride, great radio, nice features all around.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The smart key is my favorite feature. Door locks, and drive power are all operational as long as the key is nearby. I keep the key in my pocket. I want one of these for my house!

<TEXT>I have been wanting to get a Prius for the last 5 years but the waiting list and the concern about the battery longevity kept me from getting one. Now there is no more waiting list and reliability records prove that the Prius is THE most reliable family car out there (Consummer Reports) in addition to the 150,000 miles warranty on the battery in California I finally bought it. I wish I have done it sooner. The car is so much fun to drive I look forward to driving it. I consistently get 52-60 MPG on average. Actually my 2 months lifetime average is 54 MPG and it is going up. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I rented this car for a week while decided which car to buy. While I've decided to wait until Toyota releases their next-gen battery, the 2008 Prius I drove was absolutely wonderful. I commute 50 miles round trip to work each day, and averaged 40 mpg during my commute. It was also comfortable and had all the creature comforts I could want. My only complaint is that as a 5'6" driver, the bar across the back makes it difficult to see out the back window at times. If buying, I would opt for the rear view cameras. Otherwise, worth every penny. As soon as those lithium batteries come out, I'll be trading in my Honda Fit for a super eco and fuel friendly Prius.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have my Highlander hybrid set aside as my comfortable, long trip vehicle and bought the Prius for my daily compute (25 miles each way). The car is surprisingly comfortable with only adequate power (spunky). I got the package 6 (high end) version and am very happy with the leather and the bells & whistles (funky) - others warned me about the cloth seat's comfort and its affinity for picking up dirt and stains; leather was expensive but worth the $1400 extra fee. The visual feedback on the electric/gas interaction makes the hybrid owner's secret "pulse & glide" process very easy - it changes your whole way of driving!</TEXT>

<TEXT>It took me a while to get up the courage to buy a hybrid, since I had initially not been a believer. I now wish I had done it sooner. The Prius has exceeded all of my expectations and is a joy to drive. My buying experience was also pleasant. The fit and finish on the car are outstanding. The ride is very comfortable and exceedingly quiet. If cars had always had Prius-like technology, I truly believe that we would find today's standard cars to be quite primitive. Also, if more cars had this technology, the USA wouldn't be dependent on foreign oil sources. This car is practical and just makes good common sense. I think it could fill the needs of 85% of the buying public.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ability to cruise at 35 mph on electric motor only, using no gasoline. Dead silence with no motors running and no gas being burned while stopped at a red light.

<TEXT>Our household just purchased our 2nd Prius. We have a Tahoe, Carrera C4, STI and a 2004 Prius and found we were always fighting over who gets to drive the Prius. Both Prius's have all options for the model year. The 2008 model has an improved display and easier Nav system operation. (I still prefer my Garmin.) The 2004 was purchased used and has been a great car. These cars are very well built (bulletproof), adequate acceleration, low CG flat handling, very quiet interior, very good sound system, comfortable for long drives and dazzling fuel stinginess. They are great daily drivers. I would not hesitate to buy a used 2nd gen one, 2004 or newer. They will hold their value well!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, a wonderful vehicle. I like: gas mileage, ride comfort, hatchback storage, reliability, price. Handling & performance are good, not great. Don't like: digital odometer, gauges, controls and LCD panel that substitutes for these; complexity of built-in GPS (buy a free-standing one); a too small gas fill pipe; complexity of rear-view mirror, which doesn't open my garage door, as advertised; bar across rear window that limits visibility; occasionally HAL (the computer) gets confused about when to turn the engine on and when to turn it off; I'd prefer a handbrake instead of a footbrake. It's easy to leave the car on when leaving it - remember push "off."</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The hybrid design that yields gas mileage in the mid-forties is good one. There's a lot of control lost to the computer in the process, but overall it functions well. The car is surprisingly road-worthy, especially on the highway.</FAVORITE>

The display screen is fun to play with. The seats are comfy for being a car. If you're over 6'0" you will fit just fine. I am 6'4" and i fit perfect. I can fit in the back comfortably with the front seats all the way back as well. I spent $30 to fill up.

<TEXT>The touch screen and computer monitor which are standard make this seem like a future car. I added the leather interior package which makes the seats really comfortable. The standard stereo is really good, so I don't think I would even be able to handle the upgrade. I got this as a second car with my 4WD F150. I think it is really neat to watch the graphic while driving and see how the car switches back and forth from gas to battery (electric). If you really pay attention to how you drive it, you can easily get over 50 mpg in city stop and go driving (it charges itself when slowing down). When not paying attention, I get about 46 mpg. So I figure I save about $400/month in gas.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my 2008 Prius for 3 months and for the most part I love the car. I purchased a fully loaded model and I am shocked at some of the basic features that are sub-standard. The seats are terrible - very uncomfortable. Headlights are not auto! The DVD navigation system's many features are locked out while vehicle is in motion - even if a passenger is onboard. Makes the system really unusable. You can't view MP3 files, song listings on CDs, dial phone numbers on the screen, input destinations (like gas stations) in the navigation, all while the vehicle is moving. Better bet to not purchase the factory installed nav system and purchase aftermarket. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The gas mileage is great. 46-48 MPG on summer tires; 39-42 MPG on snow tires. Based on driving in Vermont - lots of mountains etc. Costs me $27 to fill it and that goes 350-450 miles (seasonal).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In most respects the Prius is wonderful. Though it's not a performance car, it's competent, comfortable, and quiet. The only serious dislike is the center control counsole, which complicates control of the heat/ac and radio -- and the digital speedometer and other gauges/displays. Analog gauges and traditional knobs and levers to control the heat/ac and radio would make this a better car. Of course, it's the Prius' gas mileage performance that makes it a winner. I've gotten about 45 mpg overall at 2000 miles.</TEXT>

Having fun with the "game" of maximizing fuel economy and energy regeneration! I must have a lead foot, because I've been averaging 43 mpg (which is more than twice what I get with my other cars.) Haven't been able to get it to average more - but we live in a very hilly area SE of Oregon City. Actually bought this for my wife, but I'm driving it more than she is.

<TEXT>I went from a Ford Expedition to a Prius. I don't miss my SUV at all (except when doing big grocery shopping) and love driving my Prius. I have made my first payment just in fuel savings. I thought I would miss sitting up high on the road, but I have learned to really enjoy riding lower. The lowest fuel economy I've gotten was right at 40mpg and I do a lot of highway miles, in addition to city driving. It rides nice on the highway (even pass people with ease) and is comfortable on road trips. My only complaint is that I seem to be a rock chip magnet sitting lower to the ground.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Prius for 3 months now and have decided it was the right purchase for me. I do a lot of driving for work, especially over the mountains, so I have really pushed it to its limits. The Prius does great in town: mileage is over 50mpg and it out-performs most every other car on the interstate. On my drives across the Rockies on I-70 I usually get 44mpg average. The engine starts to "whine" when I've been going straight uphill for too long and the battery has emptied. I am 5'9" and the car is perfectly sized for me, but my husband is 6'1" and it's tight for him. All in all, the sacrifices are worth it for me; I LOVE the great environmental profile and the low cost at the pump!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great mileage and near-zero emmisions! Makes me feel a bit better about driving so much for work. Steering-wheel controls. Good speakers. Supportive seats. The best in safety features: tons of airbags, ABS, and vehicle stability control. Its fun watching the battery fill up when coasting downhill!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've had the Prius for a month and love it. I am a big guy, but I feel I have room without cramping space. Mileage has been about 40 for the first 600 miles. I can't seem to get more than that. Most of my driving is local stop-and-go.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a car enthusiast so I had a closed mind to Hybrids, but after knowing a few people who really liked them I decided to test drive one. I've now owned mine for over 3 months and I really am impressed with Toyota and this car. Concern for the environment was my original incentive but the gas mileage is really impressive with commensurate power and handling. It's great filling the tank up for $30 (it's a 10 gal tank) twice a month. At stop and go speeds the electric motor is working with no emissions or usage of gas. Gridlock and drive-thrus or waiting for someone with the a/c or heat on is no longer a concern. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>One of the lowest emission vehicles on the planet. Great gas mileage. Extremely quiet even at highway speeds because of its aerodynamics. Smooth comfortable ride, plenty of head room and leg room in the back. Hatchback is great for hauling. Info screen great for tracking mpg. Keyless entry.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Researched fully, then bought. On the 30-mile ride home felt sure it was a mistake. Weird feeling, strange steering and braking, odd visibility, felt every bump in road. Gloom. Other cars in family are Expedition, Explorer, Focus, all recent models. Two days later I can't stand to drive them anymore! Point is, the Prius takes a bit of adjustment, like a new style of clothing you are not sure is you. V8 love is replaced with unexpected delight in the hybrid system. Controls, shifter, keyless entry are take 48 hours to get to know. I am really surprised how much fun this thing is to drive. I wish I knew whether the Touring suspension tweaks are worth it - drive the standard too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cabin design, hybrid tech, handling (you believe it? It's fun to drive). The Toyota GPS is ridiculously complicated and takes weeks of study to tame. Buy a $300 Garmin, better, cheaper, and doesn't clutter the radio/climate screen. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased 2008 Toyota Prius (Special Edition) in September for my wife. This vehicle has navigation system, backup camera and JBL premium audio. Very pleased with the vehicle, especially with the interior layout - highly functional yet not overwhelming. If you can afford it, I highly recommend purchasing the nav system, it is easy to use and contains latest updates. The backup camera and Smartkey system is also very practical. Initial gas mileage at -5 to 10 deg C is 5.5 L/100 km combined. I've fitted the Prius with winter tyres and taken it into deep snow - no problem with take off and stopping performance phenominal. Highly recommend this vehicle, considering purchasing another one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation system. The Denso nav system has the latest updates, including service station and bank logos and latest geographic data. The interior layout is also excellent, the controls are intuitively located. Interior cabin space is huge for a mid size sedan! Seating-good side and back support</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I have had the Prius Hybrid just over two months now and I must say it is a blast to drive. The fuel economy is great; handling, responsiness and ride of the Touring Model are outstanding. The 16-inch tires give the car great looks and really grip the road. The center screen depicting the real time MPG and energy/power transmission avenues in use (ICE & electric) are hypnotic and really help in teaching you how to adjust your driving habits to get better mileage. We both love to drive it and are now considering buying a second one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I were looking for a more fuel effecient car but didn't want to sacrifice comfort and space. After comparing the Prius with the Civic we settled on the Prius and I'm sure glad we did. There's a ton of space in this little car. Aside from that, we're getting twice the fuel economy we were getting with our old car. Thank you Toyota! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Test drove this car on a lark after lunch after planning to purchase a Pontiac G6. The G6 might be more sporty looking but doesnt' drive as well and gets half the mpg.

<TEXT>This is my first hybrid, and I'm hooked. It is fun to drive, looks better than I expected and has more elctronic gadgets than I ever expected. The regeneration while braking or coasting is too cool. I have already figured ways to get mileage of 55 to 61 MPG that makes me drive with a smile. Amazing how often the engine shuts off. I love looking for new ways to improve mileage, found a route home from work that is 4 miles longer but I get 11 MPG better mileage going that route in less time too. I had always heard that you got better mileage in the city, but have found that I average higher mileage on the highway. Maybe that was an urban myth.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was shopping for a replacement for my '95 Corolla DX and was shocked to find that few '08 cars got any better gas mileage than my old car. Finally in desperation I drove the Prius and it was love at first sight. Lots of gadgets and designed elements, but all with a purpose. Drives great! Has noticeably more power then the old Corolla and I prefer driving it to my wife's Avalon. Smoothness and quietness on the road at 70mph are a revelation. It did cost more than other small 4-dr wagons and hatchbacks, but I guess I wanted to burn less gas even more, not just for the money, but for the environment. So nice to drive we'll probably leave the Avalon parked a lot more. An unexpected bonus!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Lexus SUV has been parked over a year now,I LOVE this car.It can make a U turn on a dime with a lane left over.It consistantly gets 47 mpg plenty of power and acceleration on hills.Parking it is great in crowded lots because it is too skinny to get dinged but much more roomy than a Civic and almost as much as a Camry. If you havent driven a Hybrid it takes some getting used to it dieing at a light...and then taking off like a golf cart but totally cool! My parents love my car so much they are buying one.I might add I am 47... worse thing I can say is it is a bit noisy on the freeway and using Bluetooth is a bit rough for the other party to understand you clearly in that condition.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the vehicle this week after waiting for 3 weeks to get what I wanted. So far I am more impressed with the vehicle that I thought I would be. Bought it to commute to work and use as a 2nd vehicle during the winter. The exterior styling is more appealing than expected. The larger spoiler plus 16" wheels make it look much nicer. Interior is nice and modern. The amount of information on the screen is a hoot to look at, although somewhat dangerous! Keep your eye on the road!

<TEXT>I was very impressed since the first test drive. The navigation system is a wonderful thing. Years from now we'll all wonder how we got along without them! The instant mileage review helps keep me in check and will serve to boost mileage overall by at least 5-10%. And the 30 minute tracking feature lets me know my driving techniques are affecting my overall MPG. I've got almost 1000 miles and it looks like I may need to get my 2nd tank of gas in the next couple days... doing over 100 per day... WOW. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I must admit that my biggest concern about trading my Jeep for a Prius was the extreme Chicago winters. Yes, the clearance is much lower, but I never once missed work because I could get through the snow. The interior is roomy and very well laid out. While it won't win any drag races, it has more than enough power to drive comfortably in any traffic condition. I will definitely buy another for my next car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I ordered this unit in September 2007, just before the economy went south. It is one of the best investments I've ever made. Dealer service has been outstanding, but all I've ever needed has been routine maintenance. This car is a joy to drive. I bought it in part as a trade-in hedge against purchasing a next-generation Prius (what holds its trade-in value on a Prius more than another Prius?) but I will hold off until the 2011 model year. I don't buy the first model year of anything. Over-the-road economy, honest 53 mpg. Around town in dead of winter (harsh in Northern NY State), 35-40 mpg. Around-town in summer, 44-48 mpg. Not a good car, a great car. Toyota's nailed it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the Toyota Prius, but the tire wear on the original tires is terrible. I will not have my car serviced at a dealer; Sullivan Tire told me that the rear end needed shimming fresh out of the factory. I confronted the dealer and they said "that may be the case, but Toyota will not do anything about it." The tires need replacing after 32000 miles. The car isn't 2 years old yet and already I have to spend $950.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my 2008 Prius for a year. I sold an E class Mercedes to do this so I was committed to a "greener" car. I like everything about it except that it "slips" going uphill in the rain. I live in the Pacific Northwest so this is not a good thing. I am going to change the tires and see if that helps. I also had it simply shut down in the middle of a freeway and was interested to read that this has happened to others. I thought I was low on fuel but perhaps there is more to it than I initially thought. I am also curious about the fuel consumption ratings I am seeing for the 2009 models being advertised by Toyota Canada of 72 miles/gallon. Is this true?</TEXT>

I was amazed at the interior, it felt luxury all the way. The engine is totally quiet, everything about the prius is awesome. The color is light green and interior is beige, and drives brand new, comes with 7 yr 100 miles warranty. I would not trade this car for anything, wanted one last year but the price and waiting list was long, worth the wait. Radio could be better.

Dealer said Toyota made it so you can't shut off the Vehicle control Stability for SAFETY REASONS HA! This is dangerous. I've also had 2 incidents on back to back weekends where my car hesitates, the dash board lights go on and I lose all power. This happened 3 times on the highway and 2x on back road same night.

<TEXT>I commute 100 miles a day so my motivation was economy. There's no doubt the Prius delivers great mileage. I average 48 MPG or better. I traded-in a F-250 Diesel Pick Up truck for this car and was lucky to do so just prior to the big fuel crisis. The Prius saved me about $500.00 per month in fuel cost based on what I was paying for diesel. I'm not crazy about the style (looks like a bug) but it has plenty of head room and can carry more than expected in the hatch back with the seats folded down. Power is so so. Very slow to start off but will kick in and move fairly quickly once your rolling. It's all about fuel efficiency. I have to admit though, it can be a little emasculating.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Generally like most aspects of car. Handles like a go-cart with quick steering and low to the ground. Mileage is great - this is why we bought it instead of our dream Avalon. Have a ghost rattle from dash near LCD monitor/CD player area that appears and disappears with no apparent cause. Very annoying considering Toyota's reputation for quality body work and the price paid for the car. Otherwise it is fun to drive and well detailed. Still have to get familiar with many features in the manual that we are still experimenting with. Looking forward to winter driving in Wisconsin - will extra battery weight provide better traction in snow or more prone to sideways sliding on icy roads?</TEXT>

<TEXT>The title is what I hear from all of my friends and the "anti-Prius" crowd when they first sit in my car. With so many suggested improvements, why did I give it such a high mark? Mainly because the cons mean a lot less to me than the pros. Last year, I was set on buying a hybrid, so when comparing other models, the Prius was a hands down winner. The rear trunk/back seat design is much more superior than the hybrid honda civic. I also feel it is superior to the Toyota Camry Hybrid. If the Prius is too expensive, I have a friend who bought a Honda Fit and loves it. Overall, the Prius is a great car with a great design, and I am happy to see more and more of them in the Boston area!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my wife and my 2nd Prius. We also own a 2004. It has 62,000 mi and has averaged 47-48 mpg combined city/hwy. I currently have 4400 mi on the new one and am averaging 52+ mpg combined city/hwy. I regularly get 54-55 mpg city by using the surging technique. Hwy mileage for both cars is 51-52 mpg going 65 (I know that's slow by todays stds) w/air conditioning on. We both like the finish of the car. And, they are fun to drive. They have an amazing amount of room inside for the size of the car. Our 6'-5" sons can sit behind us (I'm 6'-2") and have knee room. Head room is a little tight due to the slopping roof line though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've wanted a Prius for years, but haven't acted on it because of the unavailability (so it seems). Then I saw one at a local car lot. Since my daughter recently started driving, I jumped on it so I could give her my old Volvo. I didn't get a screamin' deal, but it was the color I loved and low mileage for a used 2008 Prius. (Supposedly, the former owner was a big guy and didn't feel comfortable in it.) As for me, I love it! It's a blast to drive, sturdier than I thought, mileage is excellent (55-58 mpg around town), and comfortable. The front window is like a big screen t.v. I drive slower too which is a good thing for me. I've not had buyer's remorse at all. I'm very pleased with this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Ford Escape averaged 20mpg. I prepared a spreadsheet to compare fuel and cost savings with my new Prius. Everytime I fill up I write down the price per gallon, no. of gallons purchased, total cost of fuel, and no of miles traveled. So far, we've driven the Prius 3,500 miles and averaged 45 mpg, with a total cost savings of $365.00 and 97 gallons of fuel. Just think of the fuel and money we can save if those of us that don't need a truck or larger SUV any longer. I've hauled loads of potting soil, mulch and pots in the back of the Prius without any problems. It's time to reduce the amount of oil we consume where possible. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife was tired of the cost of fueling up her Escalade. So after some research, we bought the Prius. We bought the upgraded level because it was closest to the features we normally get in a vehicle. We live in a rural area, so most of our driving is at speeds of 55 or higher. Great economy--average of 44-46 after 13,000miles. Comfortable, surprising cabin size. OK, it is not as comfortable as the Escalade. Nor is it a roadster like my Z4. But, it is typically the car the family takes when we go somewhere. Plenty of room, low cost of operation and maintenance. When you own this car, the price of fuel does not bother you. If you are thinking of buying a Prius - why wouldn't you???</TEXT>

<TEXT>First, I should say that my present Prius is the 3rd Prius I've owned, not because there's problems with them. I've had NO problems. I avoid keeping cars too long. I take this car everywhere, on short trips and on long ones (even 1200 miles to Florida). My wife has a Camry which she likes but wants to take the Prius when we travel far because it's comfortable and to save the gas (she gets about 29mpg and my average since I purchased it on January 2nd, ia 49.4. That's the amount since I purchased the car because it gets less mileage in winter then in summer (as I suspect all cars do) and I wanted to see the average of both seasons, winter and summer. What more can I say--the car is GREAT!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The comments provided in my 03/07/2008 review hold true. I have now reached the 10K mark and have learned how to drive to max the mileage - regularly getting 54 MPG in VA summer mixed city/hwy driving using pulse & glide. I am getting ready to switch to synthetic oil which, I am told, will show a slight increase in MPG. One long trip from VA to MA and back proved comfortable with 52 MPG hwy miles. The car's funky design still turns heads and all passengers are impressed with the roominess and cargo carrying capacity. If a Toyota fan, test drive the Camry Hybrid and then the Prius; for me... hands-down selection of the Prius was a no- brainer. Only complaint - hood dings easily.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My minivan died a week ago and I was forced to buy a new car a year before I really wanted to. I had been looking at the Prius and luckily for me, the dealer had one in stock - my color and package 6. I wasn't sure if I wanted all the extras in package 6, but I'm sure glad I got them. I live in South Florida and have only had the car 5 days, so the air conditioning has been on non-stop (78 degrees) since I got it. I'm on my first full tank of gas, and after about 115 miles I'm averaging just over 50 mpg. Can't wait to see what the mpg is when I don't need A/C (if it ever gets that cool here).</TEXT>

<TEXT>More than I expected. Much better mileage than advertised. EPA estimators need to get a grip! Have averaged over 51 mpg - and I live in the "Hill City" (Lynchburg, VA)! Excellent handing, loads of room for everyone and your extra toys. Battery charging is slower than expected, but no problems. Never had so much as a hiccup with the engine, powertrain, or gauges. After 10,000 miles, this is easily the best car I have ever owned. Love the safety features, except for the backup beeping! Good thing I found out how to turn it off. :) No user serviceable parts, which is a drag; you have to take it to the dealer. Overall, it's a fun car as well as extremely efficient.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The audio is unbelievable! No gears! ABS and VCS work as advertised. Excellent interior design, with plenty of room. Controls for audio and climate control on steering wheel. And of course, the gas mileage is incredible; over 50 even at 60 mph on hilly highways!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Best design ever from Toyota at a great price. Several years ahead of the competition. Top of the line model includes high end luxuries like leather, navigation, bluetooth, keyless entry, and rear-view camera. In 35 years of driving, I have never been more enthusiastic about owning a car. The electric motor assists the gasoline engine when power is needed and does not disappoint. Even with full time maximum AC, I still get 44 MPG which will save me thousands of dollars at the gas pump every year. Surprisingly spacious cabin and trunk for a compact car. </TEXT>

It is the driver designed (instead of engineer designed), e.g., all things to make driving & safety first and foremost--and gas mileage is superb and the constant LCD readout gasoline consumption is not only informative but allows the driver to see, real time, how driving behaviors affect MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Not sure how anyone here is getting these crazy gas mileage numbers. I haven't even hit 40 MPG. I have even given up my lead foot and try to keep it at or below 70 on the freeway which is about 15-20 mph less than I'm used to driving. The ride is adequate for a small car, but that rear window split design is not getting easier to accept even with time. I just don't see how I can possibly increase the mileage to justify the cost of a car like this. At least in my case, I should have bought a cheap car like a Corolla or Civic getting 32 mpg or just go back to my much better performing and useful Pathfinder and just suck it up... literally. Maybe I'll sell both and buy the Lexus GS450h!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchasing our new 2008 Prius Touring model with option package #6 has proven to be the wisest automotive decision we have ever made. Many of our friends who can afford virtually any car of their choosing, have opted for the Prius ? some of them on their second one all ready. This says a great deal not only about the Prius, but also the type of individuals who purchase them. I believe many of us who purchase a Prius have done so not only because it is such a superbly designed and satisfying vehicle, but also because it is the right thing to do (in so many ways).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car! Went from fully equipped Tahoe Z71 and feared that my partner with 275 pound frame would not be able to sit comfortably. This has not been a problem, much to my surprise and elation. We frequently have contests to see who can get the best over-all mileage per 5 minute increment as it is shown on the dashboard - have gotten 75 MPG on freeway in stop-and-go traffic. With AC on (works great) - average about 46.5 MPG with a daily freeway commute of about 40 miles round trip. Had windows tinted and made a huge difference in the interior comfort - especially with an outside temp in the 99 - 102 range. Put 3000 miles on the car in about 6 wks.

<TEXT>OK, I have 2 big BMW gas hogs, an X5 and a 545iA. Both are superb cars, but both egg you on to drive fast and aggressively. And both are overkill for trips to the grocery store, and a 7 mile commute to work. With the Prius, you feel relaxed driving, it eggs you to relax and take it easy. When the engine shuts off at a stoplight, I lose the angst of waiting at the light. This is a fantastic car for around town and short trips, it really works beautifully. The cargo space is also amazing, it holds almost as much as the X5 (not that the X5 is a big cargo vehicle), and on top of that are the very useful storage areas all over.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smartkey system is great. You never have to take the key out of your pocket. It's as if the car recognizes you, and with the key in your pocket, it does. Makes dealing with putting a key in the ignition, or pressing a fob to unlock the door seem archaic.</FAVORITE>

Going from my big, super-trimmed out (but warranty-expiring/$60 a week gas hog) Town & Country van, I worried the Prius would be a big step down in comfort but a huge step up in gas mileage w/ the security of being back under warranty. Forget worry--I'm wowed. Although it appears small, it's actually bigger than the Corolla, & the cabin is amazingly roomy, even for adults in the back. It has a respectable amount of cargo room, w/ 2 fold-flat rear seats which make for a very spacious hatchback.

As far as fun, it takes me back to my 1973 Volks Karmann Ghia. As far as fuel economy, not even my 1960 36 HP Volkswagen bug could top the Prius. It makes a game out of saving gas and works like a champ. From my home in central California to Sequoia Natl Park , and return , I averaged 45MPG . That with climbing up to over 7000 ft. elevation, a trip of 302 miles with only 6.7 gallons of gasoline. Two different 650CC motorcycles could not do as well.

<TEXT>Toyota has produced a car that provides roominess, comfort and performance. Most importantly, it does so with great gas mileage and a lowered carbon footprint. Fun to drive, flexibility of a hatchback, and loads of safety features. They hit a home run with this one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I replaced our 2005 BMW convertable with our 2008 Prius. My wife and I are enjoying the change except on occasion we miss having the top down. One day Toyota will build a hybrid convertible. The Prius is an amazing auto, when driving it you feel like you are driving large vehicle. Your mileage will vary on how you drive. If you drive it with a heavy foot and stomp on the accelarator and jump on the brakes your mpg is going to suffer. If you drive how the auto school advised, your mpg will be better than expectied. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smart key is great, just walk up to the vehicle and open the door. Rear camera is a safety item, I am impressed with the visibility. Leather seats very comforable. Mxp 3 jack great</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only had it two days but I am already loving it. My previous ride was a 2008 Nissan Armada LE loaded with everything you could ever want, except fuel efficiency. I decided to sell the Armada and accept a sizable loss due to the outlook on oil/gas, was lucky to find a package 6 with nobody waiting for it and I only had to wait 3 weeks for it to arrive (with 1 mile on the odo). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the ride quality, the leather seats, the cargo room in the back, the driver console, the nav/console, steering wheel controls, fuel efficiency.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've had the Prius (package #2) for three weeks (~ 1200 miles). It's a very nice, comfortable car. It doesn't take long to get adjusted to the different controls. It feels very solid on the road and handles nicely. The acceleration isn't great, but certainly good enough for all reasonable driving, including freeway. The gas mileage has been outstanding, 50 - 53 mpg overall.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handles well, very comfortable and quiet.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What can I say, this car is very roomy inside (if you're a skeptic, go test drive one, you will be pleasantly surprised!), it is reliable, economical and it looks great! I bought it just in time as the price of gas was really beginning to climb and now I am at the gas station once every 3 weeks. It may be a little pricier than other vehicles, but it makes up for it at the pump. Buy this car and become environmentally and financially smart. This car is a 10. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Got rid of my relatively new Audi A6 with every option for a loaded '08 Prius a couple of weeks ago. Couldn't be happier. Maybe I am being small-minded [averaging 48 MPG of regular gas], but the car is fun to drive, holds the highway/road, and no difficult electronics.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Oh man this car rocks. The only thing I don't like is the acceleration of the electric engine. You can only accelerate so much then boom gas. But still it could use like a 60hp electric engine instead of 40hp to give it more acceleration without using gas. It gets great mileage and we fill $41 at $4.22 a gal. Only about 9.75 gallons. This car rocks. Buy it NOW! The waiting lists are rising! Best hybrid yet!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Get 47.8 to 55.3 MPG. Package 3 that has more features than the car it replaced. Comfy ride everywhere I go. Sound heavy vehicle that is very smooth and fun to drive. Wasn't interested at first because thought it was too small until I test drove one. Very impressed with what I saw, and walked away that day with one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2008 Prius in November of 2007 and now have just over 12,000 miles on it. I average between 46 and 50 mpg. It does a little better on highway trips. The car has plenty of room too. In March I took a trip with three other people to Charleston, SC from Ashburn, VA. With four people in the car + luggage the Prius averaged 47 mpg. I cannot say enough good things about this car. Since I have purchased my Prius at least 4 co-workers have purchased hybrid cars because they were so impressed with mine. If you are looking for a new car, go ahead and buy a Prius. You will not regret it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My goal of purchase: 10 years of ownership same or better than non-hybrid and I save >1/2 CO2, then it is a good purchase. And this car does just that, and then some. It's fun to drive (as intended, not in the same sense as BMW) and as practical as any family sedan of its size. I kept up with V8 cars to snow trip without degrading MPG. I drove up Grapevine, CA, full load full blast of air with the same MPG. I got 47mpg for ~12000 miles of driving. No problem todate. Toyota has met design goal: practical green family car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>While I wasn't crazy about the exterior design, my research helped me decide based upon other positive features and ease of getting in and out. I am delighted w/my Prius. It holds the road well, maneuvers in traffic well. Solid sounding door closure. Mileage is better when not doing a lot of hwy. drvg. I compute mileage by the tank and have gotten as much as 412 miles to a tank of gas and as little as 308. The specs say it's an 11.9 gallon tank, but from empty, I've never been able to put more than 8.8 gallons in it. That equates to 35 to 46.81 mpg. It sure beats the 17 mpg I was getting in my minivan. I also love people asking me about it. I could be a Prius salesperson.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought our car one month ago. Quiet, responsive, and fun to drive. First gas fill 41.2 mpg, second fill 43.7 mpg (both hand calculated). Friends are impressed with the room inside this car. When someone reports bad acceleration with their Prius, I wonder what they expect. I can pull into heavy traffic on the freeway, and have no trouble accelerating. I've hauled dirt in the back (plastic tub) and concrete blocks. It is a good all around vehicle. Wish I could put a trailer hitch on the back. Our second Toyota, probably not our last. (still have my GMC diesel pickup) for pulling the boat and camper. Would not be afraid to travel cross country in this car. One fine car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With gas around $4 it was definitely time to get a more fuel efficient car. The great thing is that we don't feel we're sacrificing anything in the way of comfort, ride, or handling. It is truly an enjoyable experience and we can't wait to see what the next generations of hybrids bring.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Prius for just under 3 months now. What a totally awesome car!! I am getting between 42-44 mpg. with no effort. I have had to fill it only 2 in 2 months and I use it every day for work. Comfortable drive, fun to drive, with an awesome navigation and bluetooth system with voice recognition. I purchased package #6, Silver Pine Mica. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am writing a re-review because this car is just super.Our Prius is with packages and option #2. Option #2 makes it one great car. We have driven it for a week and have over 300 miles on it and are getting 49.6 MPG, without trying, just driving. The no key system is great. Stereo sounds great. Like the back-up camera (but car is not that hard to see out of) really like the energy useage screen. The Prius is so high tech all on touch screen and also on steering wheel. Very easy to operate, only takes a couple of times driving and you are set. Just wish I could get my wife out of the prius so I can drive it. HaHa</TEXT>

<TEXT>I should have done this years ago. I traded in a 1 1/2 year old Lexus ES350 and couldn't be happier. The Prius is comfortable, quick, practical, economical, and a blast to drive. The color is Spectra blue mica which is rare, and I get stares from everyone. I make up excuses to my wife to drive it as much as possible. I felt that the Lexus was a great car but a little too old for me. It's great to be young again and I owe it all to Toyota. If you test drive this car, you will buy it if you can find one available. You will have no regrets and you will laugh all the way to the gas station.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I hesitated about buying the car but my 85 year old father insisted I look. I was very pleased once I got in and took it for a drive. Like some others, I'm not bowled over by my mileage - high 30s - but it's better than my old SUV. Someone called the look of this car "a Middle School science experiment" and I can't disagree. I hope they "update" the exterior with future models. Good purchase, happy about it, but a bit disappointed with my less-than-advertised MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We fell in love with this car since we got one as a loaner when I took my brother's Scion in for service. This car is simply awesome! I'm getting 49 mpg mostly city driving. It's quiet and comfortable and it has lots of gadgets to play with. We went with a package 5 which has everything but leather seats. We'd have gotten the leather if it's heated. It has bluetooth, backup camera, a super clear touchscreen (best i've seen), JBL stereo, HID headlight, smart key, navigation, etc. It's not that expensive either, considering it has so much to offer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the 2008 Package 6 for a little over two weeks and so far, I am very impressed overall. We had to turn in a leased vehicle so the timing was right to get something that made the most sense. After checking out everything out there, my wife and I chose the Prius. Very quiet, fun to drive and see how high you can get the mileage up to, and impressed with the thinking that went in to this car. As we are now seeing oil climbing at a stupid pace, each time I fill up I am reminded of the quality purchase I just made. It is too bad other companies have not been more proactive, like Toyota has been, with this type of technology. The competition has dropped the ball big time!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle to replace my Toyota Echo. I wanted a competent vehicle that gets good mileage. My Echo got well over 40 mpg. This car is slow in acceleration. The battery makes it heavy, so handling is diappointing. People and cargo room is lacking. I knew the styling was ugly. But, this is not a fun vehicle to drive. Interior is typical Toyota cheap. On the highway, mileage suffers. I don't know if I can recoup the higher sales price in fuel savings. What was I thinking?</TEXT>
