<TEXT>Outstanding comfort with all of the luxury items at the fingertips of the driver. My wife loves the power lift gate, heated seats, and overall space in the vehicle. Since it is the LTZ, the bose system and dvd make long range travel a pleasure.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Road stability is great. We feel completely safe in all conditions with the 4 wheel drive. Mileage has been 16.5 around town and 20.9 on trips.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>They just keep getting better. I had a Tahoe and 2 other Suburbans previously. The '98 Suburban I had really felt like it stuck to the road, the '01 lost that truck feel and felt loose. The ride of the '08 is great, the appearance is great, the highway/city mixed mileage is about 16 on gas and 13 on E85. I like the on- board computer w/mileage performance, XM Radio, On-Star and monthly status e- mails. The kids like the heated rear seats and DVD player plus they can load all of their junk easily.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A Nice ride, good mileage for a big truck, 18+ around town, 22+ highway @75 mph. Have been on two long trips with no problems. But they left out a lot of little things that made my'96 more fun to drive with 165,000on it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>everything is automatic, wipers even come on by themselves,..OnStar is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my fourth Chevy truck (2 Silverados, 1 Tahoe previously). They just keep getting better. I have never had any problems with any of them. The Suburban is by far the best. I have the Z71 package and love it. It is great for our large family either around town or on longer trips. Now if I can just get my wife to get one. (She is still not confident driving such a large vehicle.) If you need a large SUV, this is a great one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM radio, OnStar, hands-free calling</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Driving my new Suburban has been a total pleasure. The LTZ trim package makes this a true luxury to drive. The power towing capacity and room for 8 make this the total package for large families. This is first time my wife has ever uses a truck more then me. She likes driving our Suburban as much as I do and I don't mind beaning a passenger for a change. Our standards for this vehicle have been high traded in a Toyota 4 Runner and Chevy has really won me back with a quality product. In this class of vehicle there is no computation just the standard Suburban. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Retractable running boards and automatic rear lift gate on the outside. On the inside the hits keep on coming. There are so many to pick out a few rain sensor wipers, heated first and second row seats, the navigation system and OnStar. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our 5th Suburban and the only keep getting better. We bought an LTZ that was a company PIP vehicle. Bought it loaded with 10k miles on it. Have already put 7k more. Rides like a dream. Found out I have a transmission leak at the bell housing. I am not happy about that especially since it was driven by a GM exec and cared for by GM. Dealer is working on it as I write this. Hopefully it will be like new when done. It is by far the best truck on the road. Just hope GM is around to honor the remainder of the warranty if I need it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4wd a must in Michigan. Back heated buckets, power everything, GPS, remote start, ride is outstanding, looks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded 05 Z71 Tahoe that was fully loaded for my LTZ. Great truck, getting 19ish on highway. Dark Interior color rocks, love the power everything, rides great, fun to drive, nav is great. Already had onstar & XM but they are still nice. Excellent quality & ride is great. Considered changing brands until I drove the new style. Great job GM</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4 buckets, nav, DVD, power lift gate & remote start & climate control is better than before. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 2000 Excursion diesel got totaled. I loved it even with 200K miles. I looked at the expedition XL but the MPG was 25% less then the Burb. I got an LT1 for $30,085 including added GM leather! Plus I got a $500 Lowes card. The sticker was over $40K great rebates! Although the ford rode much smoother and was more comfortable, the burb got better MPG and was about $7000 cheaper so I decided to try the Chevy. So far I really like it</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar is pretty darn cool. Just a great looking truck</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Strong, quality SUV for the price. Owned a Durango and loved it, but the Suburban is considerably a better SUV. It has more than enough room for the family on long trips and has great towing capability. Looked long and hard before I decided to trade in. It gets better MPG, rides better, and more comfortable. Of course MPG is not the best, but it has features that crossovers to not. I added a K&N filter and it helped increase the MPG. Overall very satisfied with the Suburban.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, towing, ride comfort, good quality interior, and lots of room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded my 07 Expedition EL for a LTZ White Diamond pkg Suburban for a cheaper monthly payment and better gas mileage. I'm getting worse gas mileage than before, 13.5 mpg mixed city & highway vs. 15.1 mpg with the Expedition. But with all SUVs I don't expect great gas mileage. I love this car more than any other SUV I've ever owned. It drives great, is great looking, comfortable & roomy, it is an all aound great buy-got a steal on it too. Fits my family of 5 wonderfully and is very safe! I have active fuel management and you never can tell when it switches from 4cyl to 8. I will not be buying another vehicle until this one is shot.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>White Diamond color looks great, DVD player, power steps, roomy interior, drives well, loads of options, backup camera, lots of safety features</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Figured it time to upgrade from our 1994 Burb w/ 208k miles. Has been a true workhorse and reliable at that. Waited for second year of new model and we're completely satisfied with our LTZ, professional reviews spot on. The only option we didn't get was retractable steps. The engineering is solid, materials first rate and quality no longer an issue. As for the mpg, I work in a trauma center (ER) and suffice to say those in larger, late model vehilces with all the latest safety features predictably do much better. When one considers the cargo (family), the mpg becomes, at least of us, a distant secondary concern! Better safe, than sorry.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Abundant safety features: OnStar, stability control, roll-over sensors, 360 degree airbags, anti-lock brakes, rearview camera. Quad capt (heated) seats -love pwr release, sound system rocks, OnStar impressive. Onboard telephone very clear. White Diamond Tricoat very nice & not typical black/white.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had a 99 Burb but stuff kept going wrong so ended up with a new 08 LTZ. Overall great truck and I love to drive it. Average about 14mpg city (0.7-1 mpg less than onboard pc states) and around 10mpg towing my boat. In 3.5 months I have put over 5K miles on it. Personally, I think it looks awesome inside and out, and the materials seem top notch; except for one thing (and this is why I wanted to leave a review). In less than 4 months, my passenger side headlamp is already starting to cloud up. I live in TX and where I park it gets full sun from noon to dusk, but for a $50K vehicle, this is absolutely unacceptable!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Loads of room for friends and toys. Bells and whistles galore! Awesome stereo w/ Bose sub (my fav.). Impressive power. Two tone leather. Sun roof. Seemless 4x4 in auto setting. Real offroad capability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a 2002, so I can vouch for all the additions. When they said completely redesigned they meant it. I find the fuel economy extremely good for a beast of this nature. I drive for a living and in less than a year have put 30000 miles on my truck (mostly city miles) and it still drives like new, its a work horse. I shopped the Escalade (overpriced), Denali (not as good looking), Expedition (not a better ride), Navigator (overpriced) and the Suburban seemed to me, the better buy . Great power, fun to drive, nice look and reliable. I would buy it again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My LT3 Is fully decked out, the only difference between the LTZ is the center console and the chrome trimmings which I added for like $700 at the dealer. I love all the features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car because I love my 2003 Tahoe Z71 so much. Phenominal truck. You can't break it with a baseball bat. I gave my wife the Tahoe and traded her Ford Windstar in for the Suburban, which I now drive. Excellent ride, nice power, good braking. I bought the LTZ, so it has all of the creature comforts. Very comfortable. You could drive this car for days without tiring. Personally, I think it is the nicest looking truck on the street, with my Tahoe a close runner up. For city or combo driving I average 16 mpg. I tend to go 75 - 80 mph on the highway, which gives me slightly less than 16 mpg. The Windstar would give me 20 plus on the highway, so that is a disappointment.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The LTZ comes loaded, and I love all of the features. The navigation system and XM radio are great. The 4 cyl deactivation is seamless. The heated washer fluid is nice on subzero days. Driver's info center gives good info. Auto load leveling gives secure handling whether full or not.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this vehicle. I traded my 2003 burb in on this 08 and I love it. The ride is much better and the gas mileage isn't bad for a truck this size especially with the deactivation mode. It changes smooth w/o notice. I love the seating refinements, I drove all the way to Ga (about 8 hrs) and I was not tired, it was great. Keep up the good work Chevy, I love ya.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar turn by turn, ride quality. Pretty much all of the new features, standard and options.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased in Feb 08. Currently have about 1700 miles on it and love it. We opted for the Z71 model, because of the ability to go on moderate off road trails. I will probably look into putting a small lift on it eventually as ground clearence isn't what it should be for 4x4...my 99 Silverado z71 has more ground clearence than this, but for a family vehicle, we will love it and keep it for well over 200,000 miles. Also like the fact we can put e85 in it, though I will confess, in Denver traffic, we only get about 11 miles to the gallon. But at $2.19 a gallon, it only costs $65 to fill instead of $95 w/91 octane. The e85 gets us about 300mpg vs 450mpg with 91. No 6spd tranny for 1500. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Flex fuel, kid loves DVD, wife was really suprised with handling. I traded her Honda Pilot on this. We love all the cargo room. We opted not to get GPS, b/c a portable Garmin only cost $4-500 vs $2000. Our OnStar came with directions for a year & displays it in the driver information center.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased in January 08. Vehicle rides very good. My wife is impressed with the purchase, she even likes to drive it. The GPS, backup camera is a excellent feature. We utilize the GPS most of the time. The vehicle's performance is exceptional with the active fuel management, getting 19.5 mph at 70 mph.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather seating, sound system, GPS, backup camera, and of course the ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Without a doubt, the best bang for the buck in todays market. I purchased a 4WD LTZ with all the options. This car looks good, is wel built and perform extremely well for the size. Build quality is fine and there are no issues I can find so far. For ski trip of hauling kids and stuff, there is very little competition. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior look, engine power band, ecosystem of after-market parts and improvements. NAV and DVD system work fine. Low parts cost.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I took posession of my factory ordered Suburban the weekend before the GM labor strike. The quality of my unit should be an example - no problems noted so far. I test drove the Suburban, Yukon/XL and Hummer H2 over a several month period before deciding to order. The new exterior is pleasing, the interior is well designed and comfortable. Leather in Titanium soiled easy - later added Factory seat covers. Radio sounds great - GPS unit has worked flawlessly, though needs upgrade for new road construction in last year. Engine accelerates smooth...in-city driving 11MPG...highway cruise control driving 23 MPH at 55MPH, 19MPH at 65MPH, 16-17MPH at 75MPH. 4WD/Auto provides good traction in snow.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated leather bucket seats turned out to be nice addition. GPS has worked out well, use it often. XM radio (Disney) for kids. Ceiling vents in rear areas really move air with independent controls. You really have to have the rear camera option to ensure what is behind you - you feel secure backing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought our 2008 Suburban on 9/18. We were evaluating the Expedition EL and the Sub. I found the Suburban to have better interior quality. The standard suspension is very smooth. The 08 has redesigned gauge faces. They look better than the 07's. Sound system (standard) sounds great. Ebony Leather seats very comfortable. V8 Power is great. Wife took a trip from LA to Phoenix. Averaged 17 MPG with mixed City/Hwy driving. An excellent value. You cannot go wrong on this one. We got the Blue Granite Metallic paint. It is very sharp. We were staying away from normal white/silver/black.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded in my Yukon Xl for the Suburban. Overall, this is a great SUV. It looks stylish yet rugged and is very functional. The car is easy to drive and has a great turn radius. I feel very safe driving my kids around in this car. The new seat design is great. The driver's seat and passagner's seats are extremely comfortable. The lumbar support is superior. The front controls are easy to use and positioned very well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Our 2008 Tahoe was delivered just a few days ago. I absolutely love it. The interior is beautiful and designed well for families. We have the rear entertainment package with the DVD player and I love just flipping the screen down and popping in the movie. No cords or wires to mess with! The split bench seats are genius-- increases cargo space without losing an entire row of seating. It performs well and it is interesting to watch it switch from V8 to V4 on the highway. My average fuel economy thus far is around 18, and that includes a 200 mile highway trip and around town driving. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Driver and passenger seat controls, heated seats, DVD, power on the highway!</FAVORITE>
