<TEXT>My HHR has had wind noise and water leak issues from the first month I have had it. Who wants to pay thousands of dollars over many years for a new car that has been a lemon from the start. It is now leaking for the fourth time and really (?!), wouldn't you think that Chevy would step up and not make me fight for what is right? But they are not! I am going to have to contact a lawyer! That's not customer service!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased used hhr as second vehicle for the family. So far we are enjoying it. Have spent some money on performance upgrades and a set of wheels (had to get rid of those ugly hub caps) now my son doesn't call it lame looking any more. Could use some help in the interior though. Needs the center arm rests located a little higher so you can place a cup in the holder without having to raise the arm rest and it would also make it a little more comfortable. Please keep up the good work in the design of cool looking little economy cars. Not those lame looking hybribs (prius) that the competition makes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2008 HHR LS is an eye catcher in "orange". Black interior is neat, stays clean looking longer than lighter colors. All controls super easy to use, air, radio, windows, etc.. Fuel economy not as good as advertised but okay. The 2.2 engine is fine around the city but you have to stomp the gas pedal when pulling on to the highway, that is a disappointment, would have liked the larger engine, we learn from our mistakes. Large, easy open tailgate, storage area a big plus, so easy to load and unload. Cabin is pretty quiet, as is the engine..so far...we live in hope. All in all, I do like the vehicle, would recommend for the price, but go to GOOD dealer, don't get ripped off as I did!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy lock/unlock doors with key fob, easy open rear cargo door and cargo area, automatic lights on and off, key fob engine start, "panic" feature on key fob, adequate air condition/heat vents that can be moved to any position.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>For me, this was a great buy. Sure, I could have bought a much better car, but not at anywhere near this price (2008 used , 11k miles, under $12g). I have a bad lower back but I can adjust the driver's seat so that I'm comfortable for hours. Mileage is good. Gauge placement is excellent (in my previous sedan, no matter how I adjusted the steering wheel, I couldn't see the speedometer). MP3 connection is a lifesaver on long trips. Visibility could be better. Only 3 cup holders, but I have 5 kids ? I can't encourage drinking in the car. I also can't encourage them leaving their belongings, so I enjoy the absence of a storage console. And when I'm alone, I can enjoy a quiet ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The HHR gets great mileage on long trips about 33mpg, however mine is a manual transmission. The interior needs more cup holders there are only three right down the center console. So with that said there are two in the front and only one in the back for rear passengers. This is a very fun car to drive and is very soild like a truck but rides like a car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the folding rear seats and the amount of storage behind the rear seats, most larger suv's don't even come close to the storage or gas mileage of this vehicle. Also I average about 25mpg around town with this car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A BASIC hhr with a 5spd and a2.2, no traction control, no abs just a plain maroon colored 4door fun car that runs on reg. Gas and gives me a true 30 mpg in the city. Replaced oil with full synthetic and a k&n air filter. Bought it new right off the truck, has 16,000 miles and one visit to the dealer. The hhr has done exactly what I want. It handles great at 75 mph with no wavering behind the big rigs. The steering is sharp and precise however the torque steer is a brute. Behind the driver the available space is amazing. The build quality is on the hi side of good and the paint job was excellent. Overall I'm pleased and oh yes I drive it hard and fast no slakkin in the sun. Gas, clutch, gone.</TEXT>

<TEXT> A head turner you'd think I have the only black panel hhr in NE ohio. I put custom black wheels on it and that is it. Everyone has something positive to say about it everywhere I happen to park. A friend at work bought one a week after seeing mine. Nuff said there, contagious I say! I have to admit I first only bought because I nailed the price. The dealership didn't even fill my tank! I stole it and really didn't care that the only gas left was what I had put in it for my test drive. I don't use cheap gas anyway in my cars (there is a difference in performance), I don't care what you drive. So the HHR has won me over and the vehicle is perfect for my horse duties, the truck stays put.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE> Style, performance of the 2.2L. Paint is really nice and deep shine. Handles well and is quiet. Seats for a 6'3" guy are very comfortable, leg room is great. Stock radio and speakers are really good. That shocked me how well the sound is for a stock item. No windows means less heat when parked.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The HHR looks sharp on the outside. Nice curves, cool retro looks, good paint. However, the inside looks like something out of a 1980's era car. Cheap foam plastic that scratches easily covers every inch of the cabin. The standard stereo puts the speakers on the floor, so it sounds muddy. Windshield is very small, so your field of view is a bit limited. The sunroof works well and the controls for it are well placed. There's also a handy in-dash storage space that holds an IPod, GPS, sunglasses, etc. There are three poorly places cup holders (which makes a trip in a car build for 4 interesting), back seat is very cramped.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great gas mileage with 2.2L (30mpg+ on hwy!). Acceleration is nice despite smaller engine. Sun roof controls are well thought out. Dashboard gauges are easy to read.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have enjoyed the ride but there is a bit of a blind spot at the edge of the windshield and the side window. Take an extra second to watch for pedestrians. I also see they overestimated gas mileage efficency. I'm about 20 mpg not at all near the 30/24 on the window sticker. I drive mostly in the city so I know that doesn't help. The car size is great for the city but I chose stylish over hybrid because the mileage estimates were the same. I would have stayed with the hybriyd choice had I known the mileage was going to be so far off. It does always get a "wow" and I never had a car before that did. The double looks it gets have been fun to see.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car starter and mp3 port are nice as it the central storage over the dash. Not much for storage places, but I like zen in a vehicle, not turning it into my office or spare room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The HHR has been a huge surprise. I paid 14k for a new 2008 ls. It is far suprior to other cars in its class when it comes to usablility and comfort. The most impressive part of this vehicle is how smooth and comfortable the ride is. I travel about 30k a year so I needed a vehicle that would get great gas mileage (i avg 33 on highway) and was comfortable enought to drive for 5 - 6 hours in. On top of that the storage area is awesome. Lots of space in the rear witha great changing configuration. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was able to trade in a 08 Scion XB after seeing an 08 orange HHR panel wagon. The drive was smooth. Wish I had purchased it in the first place. The Scion was very limited in color selection, had lower MPG, tough to see stop lights, only one back up light, even with a pioneer stereo the sound was not as good as the HHR's. Buying American was nice. I just love the HHR!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had nothing but sheer enjoyment from this car since I purchased it. The engine is very well powered for a 4-cylinder, road noise is much quieter than a lot of other models, and MPGs are good considering the amount of storage space and the fact you can easily fit 4 large adults in the car. I read there used to be an issue with stone chipping on previous models, however 2008 comes with a thick protective film on the surfaces at risk from stones and that film seems to work great. Even the film doesn't show signs of impact. Only issue has been my auto light sensor failing. Sometimes it won't allow parking and interior lights to come on with headlights. Manual override doesn't work.</TEXT>

<TEXT>6 months 8000 miles. Needed 2 trips to dealer to fix warped brake rotors and drums, broken rear hatch latch replaced. paid $19K for a leftovr 07, listed for $23K. The car delivers decent comfort & performance for price. It feels reliable, motor and trans. are okay. You will not feel or hear motor inside car, vibrates less then Japanese cars. Fuel economy is not up to par, I am averaging 17 MPG with mostly city driving. I use it for deliveries, hauling family stuff etc. Nice fold downs & roomy. Rattle free, I like the interior very much, simple, elegant nice fit finish. I am happy, although car is far from perfect, see suggested improvements below.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sunroof, roominess, ease of entry exit, quiet, tight chasis. Turning radius is good. Design appeal. General Motors American made Ecotec engine & transmission. Good sound system, Pioneer speakers, plays MP3's & has input for portable player. Remote start is way cool. Design or aluminum wheels! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 08 LS Auto is fabulous. 2.2 motor 149hp is more than adequate despite the heavy vehicle. Ride is soft as expected and comfortable. We use this as a family hauler with two kids 3 and 4. They can actually get in all by themselves unlike the large SUV guzzlers out there. This is an inexpensive, economy vehicle with some flair and modern features. The info panel is fantastic and interior versatility is top notch. GM is offering the goods to the lower price buyers for a change, not just the monster SUV crowd. Interior quality is better than expected for price and segment. I think it looks more premium than the msrp commanded. Replacement parts are inexpensive too (brakes, rotors,etc)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, electric steering is a pleasant change. Ride is comfy and handling is confident. Vehicle is very low maintenance. 500 treadwear tires, oil life is super high if you trust computer (and why not). Very fun to drive for 16000 dollar car. You don't find that ever. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've had our HHR now one month, and we like it so far. Roomy for the kids, and I like not having to bend over when putting my 2 yr old in his car seat. Ive been slowly getting used to the design of the windshield (kinda small) and I keep forgetting where my window controls are, and Im a little surprised at the lack of console storage... there is none! There's the small storage bin in the dash, but I dont have anywhere to put CD's, kleenex, and other "junk"...maybe that's a good thing as my husband would prob say. Okay mpg, but not where we want it yet. We plan to change to synthetic oil and a K&N Air filter when the oil needs changed. All in all, we love the car so far. Very sporty!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The styling, the storage in back, the "just the right height" for me to get the kids in car seats (I'm 5'2", so this is perfect), I like my chrome extras we purchased, running boards, luggage rack, chrome wheels...looks sharp. I also like the info center, tells me my mpg, oil life, etc. Nice touch</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great car with lots of uses. I bought mine back in November and I love it. It gets decent fuel economy, and the driver information center is great for knowing whats going on with the rest of the car. I actually was able to fold the front passenger seat all the way down put a lap top on top of it plug the lap top into the i pod jack and watch movies it was like having a mobile theater! As far as the tan interior goes I would recommend putting a little scotch guard down to help with mess prevention. All in all a great car, you will not be disapointed! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drivers information center, OnStar, lots of room, lots of storage, decent fuel economy, very comfortable ride, chrome package makes it really stand out! Ipod jack has many uses including XM radio if not equiped. Lots of hidden compartments</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Worst mistake I ever made in purchasing a car. It's a really nice car to look at but, that's it. The all plastic interior just reaks of cheap. The front windshield has you leaning up into the steering wheel to see when the red light changes. No console and thus no decent storage space. The little thing they put on the dash is very lacking. The seats are uncomfortable. The space between you and the passenger is almost non existant. Really cramped feeling. No console between seats and the cup holders are the worst I have ever seen in any vehicle. The arm rest sit too low to be of any use. Window control location is very poor. Rear seat room is very poor. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I also own an 05 HHR, and they are similar. Opt for the ABS and side airbags. OnStar is super, worth the money. This car doesn't do anything super, but it doesn't do anything really bad either, and I paid $15,200 for my 08 with the automatic transmission and one year of on-star. Pinebelt "etched" my windows for $299 and said it was "standard procedure" although I didn't really want it. It was a pure money maker for them, but the deal was still sweet. If you want a reliable, good looking economy car, this is an excellent choice, and I would buy another one when in the market. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Got the car a few days ago, and am enjoying the ride so far. Ratings are relative to the price and segment. For the price, we couldh't have gotten a better car. My wife and I didn't want to get another HoHum sedan (at least not until we are pushing 60), and we also wanted a car that seated 4 comfortably, with a smooth ride. HHR fit the bill. Car handles better than what I read about it. Not perfect, but handles well. I am very happy with this purchase. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, smoothness, quiet ride, On Star, Engine is peppy enough, suprising leg room, Input jack for iPod, Remote start is cool, as is the info given in the Info Center like trip info, Tire pressure, MPG instantaneous, temperature outside, coolant temp, miles left in tank, Oil life left.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I think you either love or hate the design of this car. I love it. Funky, weird, retro. I thought it was unique until I bought one, now I see them everywhere! Economical and seemingly well built. Bought the car and put 3K miles on it in two weeks! Took it from GA to FL on a roadtrip. Fun, comfortable, great gas mileage. I was impressed with the AC too I havent had it long, but I did a lot of homework and it seems like a very good car compared to its peers, for features and functions. I am glad to be able to buy an American car again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Funky styling outside and in. Decent pep, smooth, good mileage. Versatile back for a variety of uses. I like the armrests, nice touch. I'm a small guy and I could sleep in it by dropping the back seats when I roadtrip!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>14 months 18000 Miles. LT2 w/2.4L engine. Most fun I've had in 35 years. Demoed the 2.2 bought the 2.4 engine. Stronger engine, fatter tires, tighter suspension made it a completely different vehicle. It loves to be driven. Average economy about 27, trips yield 35. Hard plastic door panels make it easy to knock WI snow off shoes. Installed new "studless snow tires" all around and winter traction and handling were nearly as good as summer time. I'm 6'2" and I can't sit in ANY car with a sunroof.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great vehicle for a small family. We traded in a grocery-getter mini van for the HHR, and haven't looked back for a second. Stylish and fun to drive, with quite a few modern options, plus plenty of room. I like the mix of classic chevy style combined with modern technology. Very smooth, solid ride. No problems to mention except an issue with the driver's power lock and the brakes are noisy. As far as day to day use and performance, this vehicle is a big success. The back seats lay flat in about 3 seconds and you can haul a ton of stuff as a result. We tackled a yard sale a couple weeks back and had no issues cramming this car of stuff we needed to sell. Kids love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought an HHR because I need a practical vehicle with good gas mileage. For those who like the '40s chopped top hot rod look, the HHR hits the mark and surely is set apart from its Asian counterparts. I see the hard surfaces in the interior as a virtue, since my kids always come back muddy from bicycle sports events and its durable as easy to clean for this purpose. I opted for the SS version that was engineered by GM Performance Division. It handles like a sports car and has the acceleration of a rocket. My experience with actual fuel mileage is about 27.5mpg for combined 70/30 hwy/city with the 2.0L Turbo. I'm very happy with my HHR SS and it fits my specific transportation needs well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The HHR SS Turbo is so much fun to drive that it is almost addictive. I didn't expect this level of driving experience. The styling is "love or hate". If you understand what it represents, you'll be a supporter. I am a hot rod fan and this is a little piece of styling nostalgia that hits the mark.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When my wife & I were looking for a commuter car, we started at Honda (you want how much!?), went to Toyota, Hyundai, Mazda, & Nissan (almost went with the Rogue); our last stop was at the good old Chevy dealer as an almost patriotic afterthought but we were pleasantly surprised by the value of this car, gets acceptable mileage, lots of stock doodads, power is adequate (but surprising for a 4 banger). With the rear seats folded it holds lots. It can even be used as the family of 4 car (or short time replacement when the sport ute or mini van is being serviced). Yep, we think it was a great buy and would recommend. (Just wish we went with the LT for the better seats & don't get the sunroof). </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was drawn to the HHR by its combination small-ish size but generous cargo space. I read the reviews, pro and con, and took a test drive. Initially, I wasn't hooked. The test drive was in a loaded LT, which made the car too costly and too gadget-laden to make me leery of potentially costly repairs. My interest in the car held, however, and a year later I test drove an LS with essentially just ABS and side airbags as options (std on the '09s). I liked it. Bought it. Have been driving it for 6 months and still am happy. Very comfortable. Handles well. Lots of fun to drive. Took about a week to adjust to the short windshield and "blind" spots, but no big deal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive and maneuvers quick. You sit a bit higher than in a car, so good visibility.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I still really enjoy this car after driving it for about 6 months. I've had no problems at all and have noticed quite a few more on the roads lately. The gas mileage isn't quite what I was hoping for - only about 22 mpg, doing almost all city driving - but I can still go 2-3 weeks between fill-ups. I'm still very happy with the LS model, it may not be as fast or as stylish as the LT or SS models, but for just driving back and forth to work and around town it works perfectly.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the cargo space when the rear seat is folded down. There are also a couple of extra little cargo spaces built into the rear area that I just recently discovered. They aren't huge, but are a good place to store an emergency blanket, flashlight, etc.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have almost 3000 miles on the SS. Gas mileage is better than expected so far. I commute 50 miles round trip, mostly the Katy Freeway in Houston. The last four tanks averaged 26.5 mpg (actual calculated miles divided by gallons purchased, not the car's computer mpg display.) My previous vehicle was a 2000 Tahoe, a great truck with no problems. The handling and acceleration of the SS is great. I don't have the brake issues other posters have noted. I plan to put a lot of miles on the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has been a pleasant surprise so far. It is much quieter than the Acura RSX that I replaced after the Acura had multiple trans problems and the warranty was over. Honda lost me on that car. The Chevy gets great gas mileage, etc. It is hard sometimes to see out of so I have to be sure, the power window switches are placed out of reach, but no car is perfect. My black lab is in heaven with her head hanging out the right rear window. The stereo is A-OK. Mine is a stick shift because I am a stick shift guy and I am happy with the performance of the trans. The car is quiet, rattle free, compact, good mileage, stylish, and my dog loves it. I'd buy a another one in a heart beat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a retro style car, was looking at PT Cruisers, when I stopped in to the local Chevy store. I didn't know they were making the SS verison. Drove both and for the extra bucks the turbo is well worth the extra. It's a fun car to drive with the 5 speed. Under hard acceleration have a good grip on the steering wheel, there is a lot of torque steer. I guess they have relocated the window switches because mine are on the door and the cup holders aren't covered by an arm rest. My only complaint is my right leg rests against the center console and is uncomfortable other than that I really like the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased this car, pretty happy with it so far. In my opinion its a nice car for the money and gets very good gas mileage. Nice and roomy for small family of 4. I disliked it at first thinking it was going to be like a PT Cruiser and I was wrong and sold when I test drove it. It was exactly what I was looking for. So I suggest if you're thinking about looking for a roomy family vehicle that you can haul stuff if you want then this is the perfect car for you.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow! I bought my HHR almost 1 year ago and I still love it. It is the first vehicle I have owned that did not have new car bugs or problems. I have not had to take it back to the dealer even once since I bought it. I bought the Victory Red version, and the paint still glistens. The interior is holding up very well. The features are amazing for the price range. Gas mileage is excellent. Power to go is there. Handling is good except behind a 18 wheeler on the interstate then you get buffeted around a bit. I would (and have) recommend this vehicle to my friends. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the HHR for 2 months now and like it so far. I was in the market for a car with good MPGs and had the versatility of an SUV. While it is not near the size of the Tahoe, it has similar functionality with the back seats and front passenger seat folded down. Ideal for trips to Home Depot and such. Averaging 26 to 28 MPGs with the auto trans, but will say I'm not a lead foot. I drive 28 miles to work with a fairly even mix of city and hwy driving. The driver's seat is surprisingly comfortable with the power lumbar. I haven't had a 4 cyl in 15 years, but it hasn't been a painful adjustment. Overall, I am very satisfied with the HHR. It meets my needs for good MPGs and versatility. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Again, MPGs and versatility. I don't have to hesitate and wonder how I will get something from Home Depot back to the house (for example, an 8 foot long - 2 x 4 will fit with ease).

<TEXT>I traded in an '06 HHR LT2 for this '08 SS and really am pleased with everything but the problem with the brakes! GM took a problematic brake system known as Optimized Hydraulic Braking or OHB for short! This system causes no boost to the brake system on initial start-up after sitting for a few hours! At the present GM has a couple of service bulletin's one of which calls for a software update that lowers engine RPM's to make it easier to stop (not pulling through brake application) before the vacuum is built back up, the other simply advises the tech "no part replacement or software updates". See NHTSA investigations and KickingTires 2008 Chevy HHR before purchasing. Also check Saturn Sky!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 2.0 Turbo is a 200% improvement over the 2.4, window switches and custom S/S seats and steering wheel, 4 wheel antilock disk brakes,when working, OnStar system, fog lights and upgraded sound system with CD changer built in dash unit all complement a powerful road-hugging experience!

<TEXT>It has been a great car with a few minor problems. At 14,000 miles it would make a pop sound when speeding up and slowing down. Sounded like slack between two parts in the power train somewhere. Dealer could find no problem? Now with 20,000 on it the pop is louder. The front passenger hub assembly is being replaced. The steering has begun to clunk when turning the wheel and the intermediate steering shaft has been replaced. Sunroof glass is on order to be replaced.

<TEXT>My HHR is an LS with manual transmission. It's comfortable, fun to drive, smooth ride, and with the manual transmission the acceleration is much better than the automatic. I test drove the automatic and thought it was sluggish. My manual is not sluggish. I'm surprised and impressed with the car. It's roomier than I thought it would be. I have a young family and a tight budget, the HHR is big enough for rear facing car seats and front passengers. It's a hard quality to find in affordable cars.</TEXT>

Does good on gas, and is equipped the same as a luxury car. The back is great for hauling groceries, and the seats lay down for hauling larger items. I went from a full size SUV, and I have'nt missed a thing. The extended warranty GM offers is great. I hope to have this car for a long time. I am slowly adding new accessories to dress her up.

<TEXT>I purchased my 08 HHR over 2 months ago to take the gas pump burden off my wallet (HHR $55 evey 10 days vs $90 every 4-5 days with my Silverado). I now find myself driving this car all the time and my 07 Silverado may get driving only once or twice on the weekends. I drive 35+ miles to & from work during the week and when I can lock the cruise at 60 the car will get 35-37 MPG. I am a 6'5" tall lbig guy and I have no problems with leg & head room (no sunroof - have the issue seeing the stoplights when first in line. I get a lot of people askng about the car & the fuel MPG's, the GM Performamce Air Intake makes a huge difference. My neighbor loves my HHR and wants to trade in her PT Cruiser.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great gas mileage, comfortable seating for a base model, huge interior room for passengers & cargo.

<TEXT>I have been driving Suburbans for 30 years and finally caved in to the current gas prices. I couldn't face going into a small car, and decided to test drive the HHR and found that I really liked it. The ride is comfortable, I sit a little higher than a car, and the 4cyl engine seems to have enough pickup as I drive on the expressway all the time. After 2 months of driving this vehicle I find it fun to drive and the gas mileage is great! The only undesirable is the loss of power when turning on the air conditioning.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My '08 panel HHR developed a water leak somewhere in the body of the vehicle. The dealer had it for a week and say they fixed the problem. That is yet to be determined. Problem was found when I took it for an oil change and discovered 3 lights out. I took it to the dealer and there was 2 inches of water in the rear floorboard from where the rain got in. The water shorted out the electrical system. My advise is to keep a close eye on your HHR particularly in the back seat area. If you detect an oder of mildew or notice any lights out, take it to the dealer at once. Other than this problem I love the vehicle</TEXT>

It was so cool loading up the vehicle with all of our stuff and seeing it actually fit. Perfect mix of people room vs. cargo room. Quiet, solid ride. Average about 27 miles right now.

<TEXT>First impression of the looks was that Chevy was just copying Chrysler, but after taking a test drive, I was hooked. I've had it now for 7 months and taken two long distant trips with it (avg 31 MPG AT aprox 75mph). It has a very quiet ride inside. I installed a hitch on mine for a utility trailer (which works great). The wife and I liked it so much I traded the wife's car for a second HHR in June 08! Now we both have one! I don't think anyone can go wrong buying one of these. Even with the entry level model, they pack a lot value and usability into this vehicle for the price range it is in.

<TEXT>Only have about 2000 miles so far, but that includes a couple of nice road trips. The first trip was all 2- lane roads of wildly varying altitudes, and lots of corners. The car is very confidence inspiring, with excellent grip, and crisp steering response. I was a bit surprised at this, due to the electric power steering, but hey, it's just my opinion. Maybe the only handling negative is the amount of corner lean when pressing, but considering the car's mission in life, not at all surprising. Averaged about 24.5 mpg in fairly brisk driving. The second trip was 90% freeway, using cruise control.I averaged 28.5 mpg over two tanks with average speeds of 75 mph. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is the perfect combination of practicality and sporty fun! I've only had my new HHR (LT Special Edition) for a couple of days, so I'm not able to rate the reliability or fuel economy yet. So far, so good! I love the retro styling - very spunky! Even my style-conscious 20 year old daughter approves! My HHR is very quiet and has a smooth ride. I'm impressed with the roomy seating areas, as well as the cargo space! It's an added bonus that there are two height options for the cargo 'floor'. The seating is very comfortable; lots of headroom, even with the sunroof! Very enjoyable and fun to drive. I compared a lot of vehicles - the HHR gives the most for the money! </TEXT>

This vehicle has it all! 260 hp, Onstar, airbags everywhere, tinted windows, 18" alloy wheels, lots of cargo room, and head-turning good looks. It's faster than most SUV's and CUV's out there, has more cargo room than most, and gets between 23 and 26 mpg combined. OnStar, XM satellite radio, and hands-free calling are all standard. For a few extra bucks, you can add the OnStar navigation package. The only two gripes I have about the vehicle are no grab handles and the engine is a little on the noisy side. Overall, a total winner!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought an 08 Scion xB,but didn't care for only one arm rest, single back up light, poor color selection, cheap fabric and no floor mats. We were lucky enough to find an Orange HHR that had a quarter panel (not a full panel). Since we needed at least five seats, the full panel wagon was out of the question. something about the missing side rear windows that make this car very appealing. The quarter panel is a great place for self-expression. The placement of the window controls is a little weird and takes a while to get use to. For some reason I keep hitting my shins on the door when I get out. On the plus side, the OnStar is great, it's American, has lots of room, and it comes with mats.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fun car. Love the old school exterior. Great on gas. I'm an avid surfer and my 9,8" longboard fits in the car. Makes a forty year old family man feel like hes back in the neighborhood! For what I paid for it thers not a better car on the market.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The turbo is a blast. The fold down seats make it versatile enough to get the kids from school, hit the surf, or take a nap.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I researched many new cars before deciding on the HHR. My wife and I test drove five cars (Dodge Avenger, Dodge Charger, Subaru Legacy, and a Chevy Malibu) and looked at four or five others. Although we almost bought the Malibu we both agreed the HHR would be more practical for us (we have three kids and the Malibu had a small trunk). I've only been driving it for a week, but so far I couldn't be happier. We bought the 2LT with every option. The standard equipment looked a bit unfinished. The leather interior really made the difference for me. It's strange but this is the first time I have liked a car more after I bought it than before. I don't know what else to say. It just fits.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling, interior amenities, leather seats, good performance with good gas mileage, the head turns I get when I pull up at a stoplight.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We been driving this car for about a month and each day we love it more and more. Gets great gas milage, handles great, and when you need to move the turbo kicks in. Plenty of room inside for a small car. I'm 6 ft tall, 210lbs and there is plenty of knee and head room. We have two younger kids and they love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Found that the car had more than enough power (2.4) for quick acceleration. Handling was good and the antilock brakes work great in all weather. Also found Panel easy to park in town</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The XM radio matched to the Pionner sound system was thumping and the leather seats were comfortable on a long ride (5 hrs)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought my HHR a couple days ago and so far I'm really enjoying it. I went with a pretty stripped-down model, but the difference in features wasn't worth the extra money. I would recommend the 5-speed over the automatic, the ride is a lot better and it's really a lot more fun. If you can afford a little more the SS model is awesome, but I didn't feel it was worth 8k more then the basic LS model that I purchased. It's a very smooth ride for a smaller car, handles nicely on the freeway and driving through town, plus they unique style gets a lot of looks and compliments.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage. I've been driving around for two days and the gauge hasn't moved. Sporty looks, even without all the extra features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only had this vehicle a couple days didn't like the look of it until I drove it and then actually changed my mind. The gas mileage seems like it will live up to its word which is excellent due to the ever rising prices. It seems to handle well. It's pretty sharp looking. I cant wait to take it on a road trip. The cargo area is spacious. Center console is really up on dash which is neat I guess it takes place of non existant middle console. To me it has the feel of an SUV which I like. I feel the value was great for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Body style is unique.Get lots of looks. Comfy ride and good gas mileage! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am used to driving big trucks, but in order to economize I was on a search for a smaller car that had personality. Was I in for a big surprise, the vehicle feels big inside with plenty of headroom and elbow room to spare (I'm 6'0' and about 200 LBS) interior has really good fit and finish although the materials can be a little better, it has plenty of storage space with many hidden compartments. Engine performance impressed me because it does not feel like the if the vehicle is coming apart on hard acceleration, handling and braking are both top notch and they work hand in hand with the engine power. I drove the 2.2L and 2.4L engine's but I will definetly suggest upgrading to the SS.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall performance, storage space, smooth and quiet ride, aux outlet for i-pod, bunch of extra features that others don't offer or you have to pay for. Definitely best bang for the buck!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I can find absolutely nothing wrong with this car. I love where the window buttons are to let the windows up and down. I like the size, the chairarms position and movability. Only thing I got a crack in the windshield in Jan. '08 and haven't gotten it fixed yet. My husband called at that time they were not even in stock for the new HHR's. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the SS HHR a few weeks ago and I have few complaints. The car looks and drives great - I especially like the turbo power for passing and climbing hills. The front bucket seats are made for small, slim people. I'm 5' 7" and if I was one inch taller, my head would touch the roof. The seat side bolsters bite into the side of my back - not too comfortable on long trips. After a 1,200 mile trip last weekend I got 25.2 mpg but the tailpipe got really carboned up and the oil got pretty dirty. Dealer says "it's normal" - which I doubt. Oil was somewhat overfilled from the factory and I'm hoping it just blew out, causing the tailpipe (somewhat oily) buildup - time will tell.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my HHR for only a week now but have logged about 300 miles. The 2.2 motor has enough power to get around and gets outstanding fuel econ. Im avgering 25 mpg in western PA!

<TEXT>I've had my HHR for about a month. I bought the 2LT model with the 2.4L engine. All I can say is the car is loads of fun to drive. I keep finding excuses to just get in the car and go somewhere. Performance-wise, the 2.4L engine is decent if a bit slow on initial acceleration. Handling is actually pretty good with the improved suspension that comes with the 2LT package. Brakes are a bit weak though. Interior room is great. I traded in an '03 Sonata and the HHR has a lot more room in the driver's seat and is much more comfortable to drive. Visibility can be a bit of an issue until you get used to its blind spots.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling: I like the retro look. Loads of cargo space for a small car. Overall fun to drive. Good gas mileage - I get about 24mpg in city driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought this car last week, SS models are hard to come by. I have to say I am glad I didn't get the 2lt, this thing blows away the other HHRs I test drove. I have the automatic so there's less HP but the design and features on this thing are second to none. No turbo lag and this thing hugs corners as well as my 2000 Trans AM WS6! Definitely a good family car with a very sporty edge! Two tone interior is nice. Extra options I bought: 7speaker pioneer system, sunroof, XM radio, and other cool stuff. Definitely get the SS!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The smooth stiff performance suspension, and the power. You have a lot of power on command when you need it. Two tone ultralux inserts look sharp!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did a lot of research before I bought my HHR, but I was surprised at just how fun this car really is. There are a lot of extras and small touches that make the car something special. Of all the cars I've ever owned, this one makes the best impression. Contrary to some reviews I've read, the handling is fun. The ride is as smooth as glass, and the steering is very responsive. It's amazing how tight it turns in parking situations. I can make u-turns in very, very tight circles. The small windows and windshield give the car a fun attitude when you drive, too. The novelty of the doesn't get in the way, though. It's not over the top. It's just fun. My favorite car ever.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very nice interior. Lots of gadgets and gizmos. Smooth ride. Excellent gas mileage. Driver information center. OnStar! (my car has a phone number!) even the base audio system sounds great. Very fun to drive and ride in</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I would say I am generally happy with the car. The gas mileage is fine (mid 20's), the power is fine (the gear ratios need to be adjusted), the options are very good (I opted for all options) and the ergonomics is good. It is very weasy to get my daughter in and out of the center rear seat, the rear volume is better than I orig thought and the styling is unique.The two things I would change would be the location of the power window controls and the number of cup holders available. The only complaint is the the roof liner glue does not hold with sunroof models and the dealer does not have a clue as to how to fix the issue. I would recommend this car to a friend or family member.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I didn't set out to buy the HHR but when I saw everything it offered I'd be foolish not to! My Equinox lease was up and wanted better fuel economy and lower payments.I have been averaging 24 MPG. With gas at over 3.45/gal this is awesome. Purchase price was low -allowed me to buy it keeping payments in line with my lease. Rides smoother than the Equinox and cargo space is the same or even more.I really love the manueverability - it has a much bigger turning radius compared to the Equinox - I just zip in and out of places. I knew pick up would be slower but it makes me drive safer. It does get a lot of looks - either you love it or hate it. I like different anyway so it's right up my alley</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar, On-board telephone allows you to buy minutes-great when you forget your cell phone. Remote starter, terrific storage features, cute fluorescent night light, map light on the mirror, comfortable seats, cool dash lights, nifty computer readout on the instrument panel - love knowing my oil life</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only had this vehicle 1 week now and I must say I am now on the bandwagon. At over 6'2 lots of room to spare. I love my panel it gets looks from everywhere. There are only 2 bad flaws I have found. Because the front tires are so big they throw dirt and rocks..fix. Get running boards or tire guards. 2nd. Because of my height the window controls for both windows are in a bad spot if you need to roll down while in motion. They should be located in the door. It is flawless other than that. I love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Room for tall people. I test drove with 2 large adults well over 6ft and over 300lbs. Easy fit for both. Nice soft ride. Awesome gas saver. Easy to customize.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased a 08 HHR SS and have been enjoying it. Even with the high performance turbo charged engine, I get decent gas mileage. Of course using the various readouts and the cruise control helps too. Of course there are some minor things that I don't like. But at least the window controls are back where they should be on the SS. Having to go through two tire changes when a flat occurs on one of the front tires will be a real big pain. But I have roadside service. I rented a HHR for a week a few months before. So I could see if I liked driving it. I did and waited for the SS model to come out. I got the victory red and have got several comments on the HHR. So far I like the HHR I have.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The turbo charger for when I want power and the launch mode is great too. The overall body style and look of the SS is fantastic. The soverall placement of the instrument readouts isn't too bad. The storage room is just the right size for me. The safety equipment standard and optional I got</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After reading all the brake problems, i hope this will not happen to the ss. I just bought a red ss and cannot tell you how pleased I am with it. With the 260 hp eco tech turbo engine, it is a little rocket. The ss specific interior is comfortable and well designed. The 5-speed shifts firm and quick. The exterior ss specific ground effects, 18 inch wheels with speed rated tires filled with nitrogen, paint finish and door gap fit is the best I've seen in a long time. Oh yes, the smaller steering wheel and quicker steering make this thing loads of fun to drive. It is quick. It also has larger 4-wheel disc brakes that stop great. so far happy as a clam with it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>260hp of course with 28-29 mpg. Its good looks. Stands out from other HHR's. Window switches on the doors.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It's an awesome little car. Very fast, great handling, steering very quick and predictable. Tires are good in all weather. I drive it hard and am getting 23.5mpg. But I think 1st gear is a bit low, lots of torque steer at full throttle. It is a handfull if driven very hard. Using the launch control and all I get is wheel spin.</TEXT>

Went from a Subaru with a very choppy uncomfortable ride to my 08 Chevy HHR which rides smooth has great storage excellent control panel giving all the stats you would want/need.

<TEXT>So far so good after two weeks of new-car ownership. I traded an 04 Chevy Astro Van with AWD for my HHR 2LT with the 2.4L 172HP Ecotec engine. Gas mileage is not as high as I was expecting, so I am trying to modify my driving habits a bit and see if that makes a difference. Right now I average about 24mpg between in-town and highway miles. The larger engine gives adequate pick-up at on-ramps onto the highways, and I have found myself going 85mph without trying! Quiet and very smooth ride for a small car. </TEXT>
