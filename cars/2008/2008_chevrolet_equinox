<TEXT>I have disliked this car since I had to drive it in snow the first week I owned. I thought it would be o.k. to buy a FWD instead of an AWD. I was wrong and so was my salesman. He didn't think I would have a problem. Obviously he didn't know what he was talking about. I won't buy another car from Superior Chevrolet. After making attempts to get some kind of resolution I was unsuccessful. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The car drives great and is pretty reliable. It rains in puddles on the back floor board and back where tire is stored. Nothing else in the car gets wet. I vacuumed a 1/2 gallon of water. The dealership has no idea where the water is coming from. Seats, headliners and inside interior are all dry. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I find you get alot for your money but I've had my car only a year and 6 months and already had the left front and the right front axle changed along with a door handle that fell of an interior passenger visor. I also had to have my ac panel changed because of peeling and now I'm awaiting a passenger door lock controller and a front right head light. It makes me wonder how much I'm going to have to spend after the 2 YEAR warranty if I will have to bear these frequent visits to the garage without even being in an accident and owning a new car. I would suggest a different car. I'm think of the new Audi cross over Hyundia. By the way I hate the unsteady cup holders an cheap old fashion ac vents.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2007 kia, until I found the equinox. I was originally looking at a Pontiac torrent which is a sister to the equinox. I ended up buying the equinox. Its actually wider than the torrent and the front ends are different. We recently drove it to fla for a Cruise and it was a wonderful ride verses the kia. Only bad thing is the stupid plastic cup holders... And no where to lay your phone or smokes but I fixed that problem easily. I bought a small office wire basket at walmart and put it on the dash, now I have space to stash a lot. The radio is great but the speakers arent as good as I had in my kia... But overall I give this suv a 10! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my Impala for the Equinox because we were going on a road trip and wanted more room. The Equinox has that. We traveled from Texas to Califoria and back without a hitch. Gas mileage is good. Lots of leg room. I like the sporty look of the Equinox even though it is not the sport model. The position of the windo controls took a little getting used to. All in all I would recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was skeptical of the reviews of the Equinox from this website. I debated between the Trailblazer and Equinox, but under pressure to trade my very undesirable Honda CRV, I took the plunge and bought the Equinox. I've had it now for 16 months and 22k miles. This car beats the CRV hands down. It is much more comfortable, has more power, has a smoother ride, roomier, much quieter, and the gas mileage is actually comparable. Glad I traded the CRV and didn't get the Trailblazer. Problems: I've had to replace two batteries and the radio (all under warranty). I don't know why the batteries are being discharged prematurely. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Highway mileage around 23-24 mpg. Quiet, smooth, comfortable ride. Crash Safety ratings are excellent. Roomy backseat, which slides forward to hold more cargo when necessary. Electronic info center. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I took my pregnant wife (8 months)to the car show and we spent 4 hours trying out nearly every SUV and minivan made. Fortunately we both loved the Equinox with its style, safety rating, and overall flexibility. My wife could no longer fit into her Ford Escort and she absolutely loves the new Equinox. Our baby boy also seems to like it, spending long car rides sleeping in the rear seat. The cup holders are ok, and the window controls take a little getting used to (location). Overall it is a good value and a sensible car to start our family in. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>3.6L engine, the sliding rear seat. Room enough for me, 6' 3" 220 pounds. Remote starter, heated seats. Kid protector on the rear of the passenger seat. Looks sharp, not like every other car on the road today.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am pleasantly surprised at how much I like this car. It's very roomy and quiet on the road with a lot of features not available on the competition. I have the mid-grade LT1, front wheel drive model. It's easy to see out of fore and aft, so driving, parking and backing up is easy. The gas mileage is great; I have been averaging over 20 city/hiway and it only requires regular gas. Given I have only the mid level model; it doesn't drive sporty but is pretty agile. However, it can feel tipsy in very windy driving conditions, which makes the steering feel a too light. Upgraded models might mitigate this. Lastly, while the seats are comfy, they are a bit too soft on long drives.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Although not great sounding, the stereo as well as HVAC is easy to use and quickly cools/heats car; lit steering wheel controls are nice as is the on board computer showing miles to empty, tire pressure, etc. Lots of room for luggage and back seat passengers; good gas mileage. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just traded a 2002 Ford Explorer for this Equinox and I'm loving it! I can still hardly believe I qualified for one, but I did! It is such a cute, roomy SUV for my family and I. I can't wait to take it on a road trip and see how well it does. I love how much lower to the ground this vehicle sits, it makes getting kids in and out easy. There is a ton of leg room in the back, even when my 6' hubby is driving. The sliding back seat is great, along with the 'purse cubby' under the front center console. A very basic vehicle, but still enough extra little things to set it apart. What really caught my attention was the crash test ratings. So very important when driving with little ones.</TEXT>

<FAVORITE>The main reason for my purchase was the good mileage and plenty of room in the car but small enough to fit in our garage. I'm huge fan of the sunroof. I think I am the only one here that really doesn't have a problem with the cupholders.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle is fun to drive and is quite comfortable. Has decent power and handling. Love the colour (Granite Gray Metallic), yet the interior tends to be somewhat spartan (typical chevy, although I see the 2010 model improves dramatically upon that). Turning radius is too large, and the usual issue with the cup holders is a hindrance and they are also somewhat flimsy. Back seat a model of versatility, as it moves 8" fore and aft to accommodate either passengers or cargo. I do like the height of the rear liftgate, although shorter persons may find it tough to reach. Overall a fine vehicle - and the AWD feature works well in Chicago area winters. Upgraded Pioneer stereo is rad!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD! Great size and room for the money and for it's class. Seats are comfortable and visibility is decent. Exterior trim on the LTZ is quite good - and it is well put together. Definitely get the factory installed remote starter, when available. It is a really nice feature for SUV at this price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This SUV is definitely the best purchase for a family in our opinion. The Equinox has more than enough power, and for tall or bigger person is is ideal. After much researching for almost a year, this car is extremely safe and puts the mind at ease with safety. We have a big truck, and didn't want to sacrifice room and power for great gas mileage of a car. Although I wish I had gone with the LS, this is my only regret. This base model has more than enough gadgets and the OnStar is wonderful. I work night shift and live in the country, and after a serious accident about a year ago I am so comfortable driving in the snowy conditions on back roads. With only the FWD, I have never had a problem!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar GPS. All I can say is wow! And for only $10/mo subscription it blows my Garmin out of the water! I got a remote start installed from the dealer, and it takes almost no time at all to get into a toasty car! The V6 power and get-up. The best is the enormous amount of back seat room!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought a 2008 Chevy Equinox LT-2 trim package after looking at the Ford Escape and Edge and the Jeep Liberty. The Equinox fits me fine and I'm 6ft 5 285lbs. And January 24, 2008 we proved its crash test ratings. I fell asleep at the wheel around noon and hit the guide rails on I-79 with cruise set at 68. Looks like I hit them head on. Took out 5 posts then rolled and slid down into grass. It totaled the car and all we got was sore necks from seatbelts. Even the airbags didn't hurt hitting us! But I think they saved our lives we had 5 in car. 3 kids in back. 5 star 4 sure!</TEXT>

<TEXT>At least that's what my husband calls it. My little rollerskate. I've had it almost a year now and its still as fun to drive as it was the day I bought it. My little AWD goes through the deep snow like a dream. There's tons of room in the back for the kids to stretch out and we can still take the dog along with us on road trips and it gets decent gas mileage. The only complaint I have for my Equinox is that it is a little lightweight, if the wind is really blowing I have to keep both hands at 10 and 2 to keep it steady. But up here in Michigan we don't get too many windy days so it's only been a stressful ride once or twice. All in all it's a great little family car. Cute and fun to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well I traded in my 02 Envoy for the 08 Equinox sport, and by far I miss the smoothness of the ride the Envoy had. I had 150,000 miles on it and it still rode better. I like the Equinox, I don't love it. I do like the mpg better though. The turning radius is not good. Lots of blind spots! It's kind of a flimsy car. My buddy sat on the hood and it dented so easily, but I guess that is just how cars are built today. It handles very nice, but does not shift smooth at all. When I have the cruise control on it annoys me. It is good in the snow, but wish I would of got AWD. I love the remote start and the heated seats. I have the good stereo, but for some reason it does not get loud enough.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the MP3 jack for my ipod! I like the heated seats. Handling is nice. I like the look of the chrome wheels. The little electronic info center is also a nice feature</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With gas prices were soaring, my husband and I no longer wanted to keep a truck and we traded in his 1997 Silverado for the Equinox. We wanted a small SUV with AWD for winter driving. It handles well in bad weather; rides comfortably, but it hesitates when trying to excellerate on the highway. I didn't like the window controls on the console at first, but I got use to it. Gas mileage was great on a trip to Ocean City MD. We got about 29 mpg. My husband was excited about that. There is not a lot of room in the front. The cup holders are cheap and awkward. Despite a few negatives, we both like our Equinox. Unfortunately, my husband still misses his truck, even though he likes our new SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Within days of purchase realized the motor was too loud. Dealership said that was normal only to rescind that point of view a week later when we took a stand that it was unacceptable. Vehicle in the shop more than 2 weeks while they tore the motor down and discovered a bent connector rod. All fixed up at no additional cost to us, but not very impressed with a rebuild on my new vehicle. Recent problems include the inside windows actually frosting up and staying covered in ice despite the blowers going full tilt....again dealership indicated this is a problem with these types of vehicles. Wonderful news. To top it off, this morning the thing wouldn't start! Towed to the dealership again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I first got this car because I liked the way it looked, and it was the only SUV out there at the time that was roomy but didn't feel like you were driving an 18 wheeler. The price was great too compared to the other SUVs of similar size that were available. I have not had a problem with it and I especially loved the free for 1 year OnStar service it came with. Although they skimped out on the turn-by-turn direction service. You can only ask for directions 1 time. After that you have to pay for it...go figure. I also like that you could adjust the rear seat to move further back for more leg room. </TEXT>

<TEXT>GM has hit their mark with the 08 Equinox Sport, most of the reviews I've read from actual drivers (not people who write car reviews for a living I'm talking people who actually matter) say that the 3.4L engine was underpowered and not overly responsive. This is not the case with the 3.6L engine; this engine growls and throws you back in your seat on a whim. The interior space is actually amazing on all Equinox trims, when looking at the Equinox on the outside it looks like a really small SUV/Crossover but when inside and you start to load it up, you would never know how small this vehicle actually is. I would recommend this vehicle for anyone interested in sport, handling and cargo room.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've made a couple of trips to the VA mountains from the central NC area after installing a reciever hitch and hauling a ROLA cargo box. We've been through a couple of oil changes (3000mi) and we like our Equi more than when we first got it. Gas mileage on our trips, which includes a lot of mountain roads and town driving has averaged almost 22 MPG on both trips! We confirmed the computer reading by figuring it the old fashioned way, just to make sure. Have had a couple of small warranty items repaired with no problem. This is a fun vehicle to drive and my wife (primary user) loves it. Sun roof and leather makes it nice. Entry front and back is great (I'm 6'2" and 255lbs)! </TEXT>

<TEXT>We took our new Equinox on a road trip a week after we got it, a very pleasant ride. Comfortable seats, the long wheelbase makes the ride smoother, easy to get into. Fuel economy is much better than my 06 Trailblazer, and there is more interior room for passengers. The big cooler sits flat on the floor in the back seat, XM radio & OnStar are also great. The electric steering is quiet and efficient. It is just a great ride. We're going again in a couple of weeks, and I can't wait to get on the road. Then, in everyday life, it's easy on gas around town, easy to park, simple to maneuver. Plenty of room for stuff in the back, too. This might be my most favorite car ever. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the LTZ black metallic after lots of research. Had the Escape for 4 years and never got used to the rough ride. RAV4 seemed just as rough on the test drive. Considered the Santa Fe, but it didn't have the 'cool' look and features even though storage is a little better. Agree with others about bad cup holders, no room to access driver side recline lever, and limited storage. My gas mileage is about 17-18 mostly in town driving. Sunroof, fog lights, remote start and XM are fun to have, and the roomy back seat is great for adults. The wasted space btwn front seats is annoying and I wish I had more places to stuff things. My first black car and it has been great in California</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. My first SUV and I never thought I would ever want one. I got it because many times I would buy something and not be able to get it home in my car. My 80lb dog rides nicely in the back area. Plenty of room for him to stretch. People with long legs can sit comfortably in the back seat. I haven't found anything I don't like about this car. Lots of great features included that are usually options on other cars. Would recommend this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Equinox (first was an '05.) I loved my first, but wanted a remote start plus some of the other new features. I'm getting 20.5mpg mixed driving, straight highway I get 29-30mpg. Remote start is great, as is the XM and OnStar. I miss the cargo shelf in my '05, but the space that's freed up is really nice. I don't care for the double cup holder in the front. If you pull up the emergency brake, you can't put a drink on the left side. Also, the air will not stay on the recirculate setting on certain vent settings, and reverts back to exterior air when you re-start the engine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven 1000 miles so far and I can't believe the fuel efficiency from this SUV! With good driving habits I am getting 18.5 in the city and 30 on the highway. I avoided purchasing an SUV because they are typically gas hogs. This has the perfect mix of MPG/HP/Torque. It's 3500lb towing capacity pulls my camper with ease. The ride is just right. Not squishy like a minivan, but not too truck like either. The steering is not real responsive and takes a few miles to get used to. Once you are accustomed to the feel, you will enjoy its light touch and accuracy. The spare tire is stored inside the SUV keeping it from weathering. The stereo is a bit flat, but acceptable for factory.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Back seat that slides up to give more cargo area or back for lots of leg room. This back seat keeps my kids happy while on long trips! I also like how comfortable the front seats are. The Leather wrapped steering wheel with radio controls is a great feature. Driver info center w/MPG readout!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I previously leased a 2006 Trailblazer and while I like'd the room, the fuel economy was bad and it handled slow. Being 28, I wanted a sports car, I wanted an SUV, I needed something smaller and I wanted AWD for the winter. The result was the Equinox Sport AWD and I couldn't be happier. Very fast, very comfortable, tons of room and a comfortable back seat, sporty, cool looking and a great premium stereo system (unlike the Bose from the TrailBlazer). Overall, I'm very happy and I couldn't of made a better choice that fit me year round in an environment that has extreme weather of the summer and winter.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Equinox for four months now and am very pleased with my purchase. I test drove practically every SUV in the class and the Equinox came out on top. I came close to buying a Rogue, but the interior was cramped and lacked features. I am partial to the exteriors of the RAV4 and the Ford Edge; however, they are also lacking in the features department (at least on the basic models). The Equinox comes with a lot of bells and whistles for the price. I love the OnStar feature and the information screens. With one push of a button, I can check my oil life, tire pressure and remaining gas mileage, etc. The fuel economy isn't bad for a vehicle its size. Overall a great purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We upgraded to the leather interior because the cloth interior was less comfortable and did not look like it would last long. There is lots of room in this SUV. We are getting 25 mpg plus right off the show room floor, that includes a 50-50 mix of city and highway driving. There is very little road noise on the inside while driving. Vehicle handles well and has more than enough power with 6 cylinder engine. The report of the cup holders is accurate, they are pretty chintzy. The lever for the steering wheel adjustment is also more difficult to operate while driving. Wish the rear hatch had an automatic open with the key chain, the gas cap door had a lock.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Chevy Equinox has been a great car for me. I am a detached insurance agent and this car has givin me plenty of room and comfort. It has a pretty great stereo system for those time that I have been in traffic jams and not had much to do.

All around it has been a great car for the business man and his family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For the money it is the best midsize crossover vehicle period. Easy entry exit. I have a bad lower back. Great view when driving. Very comfortable. A lot of room. Great engine, transmission, brakes. Prefer old style steering. Electric steering is kind of numb, vague. Not good road feel like traditional steering. Would like to see 6 speed automatic and engine with more horsepower and torque. I get a lot of compliments. Mine is ruby red.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The ride in the Equinox is very smooth - the suspension is great and it drives like a car. I was also surprised coming from a much larger engine that the smaller V6 still has a lot of get up and go. In addition, I'm getting 25mpg highway and 21-22 city. To me this is the best feature especially since the gas tank holds 20 gallons - which I think it kinda big for this size SUV. Anyway, its nice to be able to go over 400 miles on one tank. I just started a carpool at work, and the Equinox easily fits 4-5 adults - especially with the rear seat set back.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall I like the 2008 Chevy Equinox however I am very unhappy with the center console. The emergency brake is in the wrong spot and the 12VDC outlet is right under the pullout cupholders. Liquid and power do not mix well. I am really unhappy after reading earlier articles about the 2006 Chevy Equinox with the same complaints. Will American car companies ever get their act together?</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Equinox. I previously leased a 2006 AWD LT. I recently bought the 2008 because of great dealer incentives. This one has much better handling, fewer blind spots, and a excellent, comfortable ride. I like the standard OnStar, which I used to have in my leased Trailblazers (3 of them). The gas mileage is excellent (25-26mpg hwy) even though I'm still in the process of breaking it in. I get a lot of compliments on it and it looks very sharp in black. I also got the remote start and it is awesome (cheap add-on, too). I looked a lot of vehicles and am so glad I bought this one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I guess i got screwed because mine didn't come with free OnStar for a year, or 3 mo. of XM radio. I did buy it used though with 15,000mi. I do like the smooth drive and I think the seat cusions are very comfortable. I do not like the interior. Looks very cheap on the doors and center console. I'm not a big fan of the cushion pattern. I came from an 03 Eclipse Spider, convertable with leather. I wish I had a sunroof at least.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's very roomy. The dash with the wood grain I like. I can plug my Mp3 player right into it. The leather steering wheel. The smooth drive and it can go when you want it to. The gas is Ok I get 20 MPG.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have owned vans for many years but decided we wanted to size down. I loved the look & price of this car and the ride is good. Some of the interior design is a little "cheap" in quality, but with the good price of the car you have to expect that. The two things I do not like are the sun visors are too short, they could use an extension of some type & the way the hatch opens, it is hard to get it open you have to grab it in just the right place. We do take a number of weekend trips and have found the gas mileage to be getting better. We are getting about 30 miles to the gallon now. Too bad the gas tank could not be a little bigger, but like I said we owned vans before.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned the Sport version for 5 months now and love it! Very comfortable seating both front and rear, plenty of room all around. Sport version has a stiffer ride than other versions, but not too harsh, handling is top-notch. Terrific forward visability and very stable and quiet at highway speeds. If there is a better crossover SUV in this price range, I haven't seen it. Only low note, is that I wish fuel mileage was 2-3 mpg better - but who doesn't?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seating comfort and interior room is outstanding for a vehicle this size. It is a very quiet and stable platform for freeway driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After test driving suv's from Honda Pilot, Fords Edge, GMC Acadia, Saturn Vue, we decided on the Chevy Equinox. Two main reason's; 1. Ease of getting in and out of the vehicle. 2. This was the only vehicle that didn't have an obstructed view by wide front door window trims. The viewing area is much more open than any of the others. We also found the dash was not raised or slanted upward, but smoothly angles downward. Both my wife and I have bad backs and it's entry is with ease on my 6'2" 280lb frame. My wife just lost both breasts to cancer and pulling down on the rear hatch is not a problem as it was with the other SUV's. All in all, a well rounded design and earthy downhome elegance.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Electric controls on the console. Engine smoothness in acceleration. Steering handles well and the road noise less booming than the other suv's we test drove.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Vehicle looks great. Sonama Red Metalic with silver pinstripes. Performance is outstanding and the vehicle gets a lot of looks and positive comments. Heated leather seats are a big plus. Love the Pioneer sound system and the sunroof. Did not really plan on getting the sport as looked at the lower end models, but glad purchased this model instead. Only problem so far was in-dash cd player. It would just quit playing discs at certain times. Once ignition switch was turned off for a few minutes the cd player would work again. Sometimes for a few hours, sometimes for just a few songs. Tried different discs and same problem. Dealership replaced the radio/cd player now works fine.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance, nice looks, heated seats, leather seats and sun roof. Came with the sun sound and leather package that saved about $1,000 if ordered seperately. The wide rims, dual exhausts, and the front air ducts really make this SUV look bad and fast.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the LTZ New Year's Eve, and I am very pleased with this vehicle. I drive a lot of highway miles and average about 23 mpg, driving 65 mph. It drives smoothly, handles well, though turning radius isn't the tightest. With the back seat pulled all the way forward, there is plenty of cargo room, and with it all the way back, plenty of leg room. The Pioneer sound system w/subwoofer gives premium sound. I would suggest adding more storage compartments. The driver's visor extends, but the passenger's does not - kind of odd.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Really disappointed that I bought this truck. Traded in my 2003 fully loaded Trailblazer EXT and this is such a step down. GM really went the cheap route in the interior. The Sport version lists for $40k Cdn and there are so many better trucks for that amount of money. The biggest complaint is the ride. From what I can tell the Sport is the worst of them all but it is totally uncomfortable and bounces all over the road. This will be traded quite soon.</TEXT>

I am a single woman, and this is a good feature for me. I also like the OnStar feature and hands free telephone. I drive to work every day, a 52 mile round-trip day, so far I am getting approx 21 MPG. I hope to get better as the car breaks in, of course this is a lot better, than what I was getting with my Chevy Avalanche. My friends are very impressed with the looks of the vehicle, inside and out. So far I think I made a good decision to buy an Equinox.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Runs great in that have had no problems so far, but only have 3000 miles. Has great pick-up when needed, corners well. Style is impressive and everything inside "makes sense". The ride is not as smooth as I'd like to have it, but we're not talking a Caddy here. Drive conservative and get 25 MPG, but do little city driving. Realistically, I'd probably get 21 if I drove like I used to do when gas wasn't gold plated, but if we can put a man on the moon, surely we could design one that gets 30 mpg. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am not happy with the location of the lever to adjust the stirring wheel. It is not safe when you are on a long trip and you need to change setting's. I have to pull over to do it as it is hard to do it (over correct and turn into some one). And I am not a tall so I need to change it on trips) and also the adjustment on moving the seat, up and down. It stinks. The emergency brake is in a location the is really unhandy. I wish I would have check this car out more. Should get more for what you pay for thise car's. Did not want to pay real big money out and this is what you get. Poor quality. I hope to trade in couple years. I always was with GMC. I needed a car at the time & think I was pushed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went into the dealership just to look at the Equinox. (I did research online first) I test drove the car and after talking with the sales man I bought it. I gotta say I have only had it a month and I love it. It's high off the ground but not too high. The engine is so quiet. I would definitley recomomend it.

A little thorn is with a vehicle of this size you would think that it would have better mpg as I do 60% hwy. Disappointed with the decrease in the driving range when the car idles. I hope this improves as it gets broken in. Maybe I'll have to shut the engine off at stop lights, kind of what they do in Europe.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the Equinox Sport just over a week ago and like it more and more. We traded an older Acura MDX for something that still had AWD, good power, and better fuel economy. All in all so far, the suspension on the AWD Sport is stiff, yet easily steerable, the motor has plenty of power for the average "Race-ready" father, and lots of interior room. I think the inside could be more refined, but we are used to forein cars. The console and sun visor's seems chincy, nice leather, ample leg room, like the gauges,and decent mpg if driven normally. We do 60 miles a day on the highway, and the mpg is averaging 22 right now. This is not a Lexus or Acura, but Chevy has done well and added options.</TEXT>
