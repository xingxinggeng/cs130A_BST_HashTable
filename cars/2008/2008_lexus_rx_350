<TEXT>Purchased the FWD 08 RX350 in NOV 08 with 16,000 miles it was certified pre- owned. I like all the bells and whistles that it came with, such as the telescoping steering wheel and leather seats just to name a few. I drove it from SC to TX and the drive was excellent, nice and quiet. I do not like the front design, it looks too feminine and also the so claimed re sale value is terrible. I tried to trade it in and was sadly informed that I would be 10k upside down if i traded it in with 27,400miles in excellent condition. Although it is a nice vehicle it does not hold its value.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Rather than detail all my Lexus woes, which the dealership has tried and sometimes succeeded in fixing, I can just say that this 2008 RX350 is the noisiest car I have had. There is a persistent rattle in the rear passenger window that looks like it is caused by a faulty window assembly. The bumper rattles when turning. The car has been through a bit -- as a car in NYC is wont to be -- but the quality problems have been very disappointing for a car with a stellar reputation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This Rx is the third I've purchased since 1999. I must admit Lexus got me hooked. I particularly enjoy the sports tuned suspension with the low- profile tires and increased horsepower. The gas mileage is exceptionally well I routinely averaged 27 miles to the gallon on the highway. One experiment on Route 80 from Lake Erie to Jersey border with cruise control set at 65, I actually received 31 miles per gallon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our 3rd RX out of 4. Good ride and features,interior. Navi console impressive but difficult. If you want navigation get a Nuvi or Tom-Tom and save yourself $2k. Backup camera & Bluetooth good features but no IPod or MP3 input (BTW what's with the tape player). Lock-out during driving sucks... give us a break big brother! Maps and POI are out of date... maybe 2005 maps best guess. Update are extra service charge. Ride is rough. Tires loud, interior noise very high (road, engine). Overall comfort for 4 OK but don't drive too far without a break. We get 21-23 mpg not bad. Lawnmower engine but it's perky. Price value more like $30K instead of $40K. Might be our last RX after lease </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Backup camera, wipers, bluetooth,overall design ok. Auto rear hatch, nice storage underneath the cargo area for road stuff. Cargo cover a bit much, make it an option. Headlight great love it when you go around corners. Driving is comfortable, no feel however. Fun vehicle and overall function OK.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Good comfort and ride. Gas mileage is surprisingly good, between 18 and 24 mpg depending on how much city vs. highway driving we do. Room inside is good for four people. Cargo area is disappointing with rear seat up. Rx is easy to drive and park. I'm not really overly impressed with anything about the RX except the power plant, it has very good power for a car of this weight. I will return the RX in 23 months but feel satisfied so far. Just not impressed enough to want to buy it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Vehicle drives and handles great overall. Car had tendency to pull to right while driving. Dealer re-balanced tires and realigned front end on several occasions,but vehicle still had slight pull to right. Around 15,000 miles, car started making a roaring sound while driving (sound like excessive road noise). When I took the car in for the 15,000 mile checkup, dealer informed me that tires needed changing. Dealer said Lexus cars come equipped with low quality tires (Goodyear). Replaced the Goodyear tires with Michelin tires which were recommended by the dealer. By the way, I had to pay for two of the new Michelin tires. Never had a tire wear out in 15,000 miles (40 year driver).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have only had my 2008 RX 350 for 2 months & really love it. The handling is so smooth even tho the turning radius is not as tight as my 2003 Ford Expedition! The seats allow me to sit up fairly high which I like as I'm short. I find the back lumbar and seat adjustments especially nice. All the tiny lights in the drink holders and floor are a nice touch. The mileage is not too bad, but certainly not all I hoped for. Most of my driving is just around town so I don't know why it various from 14-18 mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power rear hatch is great. Like floor emerg. brake so it doesn't take up console space. Adjustable center console allows a perfect location for any handbag. Nav. system & Bluetooth are great. Self adjusting headlights are great & I love the power of Xenon lights.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd SUV and it is definitely the best. My first was a 1980 K5 Blazer and the second was a 1992 Explorer, both bought new. This is also my 3rd Lexus and the build quality and service is why I like this brand. So far this SUV has been a pleasure to drive. It has the Premium Plus pkg., 18 inch 7 spoke wheels, heated seats and rain sensor wipers, towing pkg. Cargo room is a little small behind back seats but fine when back seats are lowered. I plan to use it for hunting, fishing and carrying my dogs as well as domestic uses.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are the back power door and rain sensor wipers. Audio system is standard but the sound quality is supurb.Also thought the cargo mat was great as one side is matching carpet and the other is rubber for when you carry something that may wet or dirty.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We carefully selected the RX 350 on reliability, resale and original price and have been very pleased with the vehicle. We bought a new E-350 Benz about the same time, paid $12K more, and got less value than the Lexus. The Lexus navigation and accessories are touch-screen, all the controls are easily accessible and although a very complex machine, is user friendly. The Benz and a new BMW 5-series in our family require a degree in computer science and a full stop to do the same thing the Lexus system does. Sensible driving gets 20 mpg in local traffic. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Absolutely love the included Bluetooth, backing-up video display, and the power rear door. The additional left-side driver's dash cupholder is pure design genius.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased the vehicle mid Dec. 2007. This is our first Lexus. Currently has less than 3000 miles. Car has plenty of pep, very quick and responsive handling. Easy to park and a fun car to drive on short trips around town. Not a vehicle for a long trip. Very disappointed in the ride and road noise. Expected the ride to be much smoother and quieter especially for a Lexus. Cannot compare to my E Class MB. This a good vehicle for the lady of the family. I thought I would give the Lexus LS 460 a try in a year or so. After purchasing the RX 350 I've decided to stay with MB.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auto rain sensing wipers, auto headlights, auto dual comfort system, power rear door, fit and finish, pleasing design inside and out. Smaller compact size of vehicle makes it easy and fun to drive especially for a woman or shorter person. My wife loves to drive the vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is what my wife wanted and it has exceeded her expectations. From my perspective, the RX 350 is boring but dependable and it holds its value. Only one issue, the leather seats are not well made and your clothing colors may darken the seats. The dealer claims " the seats are so soft, that's why they are absorbing the color". That is "bunk". We have a bamboo Pearl exterior with tan leather - clothing fabric should not be absorbed into the seats--be careful. Nothing compares to my LS,but my wife loves the car. And it's all about her.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I love our Lexus RX 350, an amazing blend of ideal traits providing the utility of an SUV, exceptionally smooth driving experience, startling acceleration for an SUV, incredible gas mileage for an SUV (we're averaging 23.5 mpg in mixed driving), very smart interior layout with little extra touches like the extra retractable cup holder to the left of the steering wheel in addition to the console cup holders. It's extremely comfortable, making short and long trips a pleasure, etc. It's quite evident that a lot of thought went into this vehicle. It's so versatile without compromising performance, safety, quality, or comfort.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power lift gate, comfortable seats, back-up camera, gas mileage... particularly for an SUV with so much power, smooth ride, three position reclining rear seats, automatic adjustable rain sensing wipers, turning radius, and absolutely, no buyers remorse.

<TEXT>Let me preface by saying that my wife and I have owned several different cars (3 hondas, 1 nissan, 1 lexus, and 1 bmw). This is our first foray into the SUV market. Lexus again has produced another great product/car!! This car is the best value for the money. The one we purchased was silver titanium with black leather. Premium Plus package with navigation. Chrome 18 inch 5 spoke wheels, HID, AFS, and All wheel drive. The car we just got rid of was a piece of crap 2003 BMW 330i sedan. BMWs may have that "fun to drive" factor BUT mechanically and quality wise they can't compare to the Lexus. The build quality on this Lexus is superb. Fit and finish is top notch.</TEXT>

<TEXT>To sum it up, this is our second RX. Our first was the 2004 RX 330. However, my wife always liked the Bamboo Pearl color, so when the timing was right, we purchased a 2008 RX 350 in that color. Overall, the vehicles are the same. But I will say the changes made from 2004 to 2008 were needed; performance is better, tighter, and overall a real pleasure. The vehicle is now 3 months old and my wife constantly reminds me of how much she LOVES her new car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased a new RX 350 a month ago as my ES 330 lease expired. I needed more room and at a minimum fold down seats. The IS was the only model with fold downs and that was too small. Room is great - feels spacious inside- kids have a lot of room in the back. Got an annoying dash vibration noise in a week and I do hope that can be fixed - very annoying. Feel that the road noise is quite high. Handling is excellent - very good acceleration and fit is finish is superb.</TEXT>

The RX is so quiet, more quiet than my BMW or my wifes Jaguar! The AWD is great. I drove the BMW X5 and MB M Class, and both were $12-$15K more. The Lexus should prove to be a great value!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased a new RX 350. I have been very happy so far! I go through about 35k miles a year, so comfort and quality are my biggest concerns and this vehicle meets these with no problems at all. I trade out about every year and this is by-far the most enjoyable midsize SUV that I have owned. And I have driven everything from Toyota to BMW to Honda. There are a few weird things could be changed but not every vehicle is perfect. Great choice for a comfortable and stylish ride and perfect for sales! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The nav and Bluetooth are a must for my job. The quality of materials is also nice feature. All the large storage pockets and adjustable front console are also nice features. Very smooth and quiet ride, and I have been averaging 17MPG-18MPG with all city driving... not bad for an SUV!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a 740il for 8 years and should have know it would be a hard act to follow. I didn't expect it to be anything like that but am surprised at the lack of quality I've experienced. I've had two new batteries the first month, not sure why. The driver seat is already showing wear and darkening after a short 6 months. At 10,000 miles the interior rattles began. First the dash and then the windows. I've not been able to get these corrected after 3 attempts. The motor started making a rattling noise in the mornings. Only during the first 5 minutes then it's fine. I'm afraid to see what will follow as time goes on with this car so I'm selling it. Perhaps good for the price but no quality here. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second RX. Just traded in the '04 model and I'm blown away with all the upgrades. Clearly there were focus groups held and Toyota/Lexus listened! Better acceleration/power, better fuel economy, and all the right upgrades to the navigation system. I bought again based primarily on the RX's proven track record for reliability, no test drive, no haggling, and I was blown away when I sent to pick up the car. Everything on my wish list from the '04 was delivered.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am on the road a lot and appreciate how quiet this vehicle really is. The cabin is so quiet I actually look forward to talking on the cell phone over the car's blue tooth. I have owned Hondas and Toyotas in the past so appreciate the level of build quality that went into the RX. I have near 15k and not one single problem. I average around 21 in the city, 27 on the highway. In summary, Lexus RX 350 is the gold standard of SUVs. </TEXT>

The tires were out of balance, electrical problems, road noise, wind noise,fit and finish problems. The base audio system is poor. The factory Nav. system came with the "old" version of software! For $46K this car is over priced over rated and just a Lexus to forget. It is in the class of a Buick or Cadillac not BMW or MB.Do not purchase one!

<TEXT>For the past 9 years I have had an ML320 and was persuaded to trade it on a new Lexus. So I get the RX 350 and all I can say about it is that the fit and finish are great. For the rated horsepower it seems to underperform. I was used to a car that was much heavier with a lower horsepower rating that outperformed this dog. All I can say about the handling is that it reminds me of an old man car like the old Buick LaSabre. Very boring and no feel of the road. If you own an M Class hold on to it and treasure it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the car in March 07, and have about 7500 miles on it. I love everything about the car, from its great looks to the wonderfully comfortable ride. The car has plenty of pep, and gets above average gas mileage for an SUV. The interior cabin is so quiet that it feels like you're in a sound proof room; no road or engine noise at all. The car has just about every luxury feature you can imagine, including a color video back-up camera which is very useful. My first dealer experience at 5K miles was great, they really treated me right. And the best part about that first service is it's free! Anyway, great car, and I'm very happy we got it.</TEXT>

Lexus Quiet!!! This car has a lot of noise. I will be trading for a BMW or Benz in the spring. Do not be fooled. Drive a BMW or Benz before you purchase a RX350. Yes, it is just a dressed up Toyota for 10K more. The RX350 compares to a Ford or Chevy not a BMW or Benz.The only saving grace is the dealer service and the fuel economy is great.

<TEXT>I'm updating a review I posted in April. Things have happened since then. The RX was involved in a moderate collision ($2500 in damages to the lower front end) but was able to drive away from the accident. I can't say that for the other vehicle. The Lex is indeed a safe ride. That aside, the only thing I miss about my '05 Solara convertible is the stereo, oh and the convertible part. At the first service interval, I had the dealership install a hitch receiver so I can use a bike rack. Not cheap but worth it, just like the car itself. The only thing that has failed is the express-close feature on the moon roof. The shop was able to reset it. </TEXT>

I don't know if this is due to the tires or a lack of cabin insulation. The ride is average, definitely not luxurious, and do not plan on seating more than four adults comfortably.

<TEXT>This is my third Lexus RX and by far the best yet. The previous were 2004, and 2005. The 2008 is smoother, quieter, faster and slightly more fuel efficient than the 330s. The transmission shifts seamlessly and the power comes on more smoothly. This car is one that can handle many needs. Its very comfortable and all the controls are easy to use. Everything works perfectly. The back-up camera and gen 5 nav systems are definitely upgrades over the 2005. Both previous RXs were very reliable with no service issues at all, and this 2008 should be the same. Has no problem in snow. Gets you where you need to go in comfort and without any worries. This is where it excels. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Great vehicle. Having owned it 3 weeks, there are disappointments: 1. Basic sound system is shockingly poor. My 2000 F-150 system is better. We assumed the sound system would be superb and failed to even turn it on during the test drive. I assumed Lexus would overachieve on this basic. Dealer says that's how they all sound. I would have paid for the premium system but there weren't any on the lot. Dealer advises it is not a good idea to post-sale upgrade it due to complexity. 2.The Lexus on site programmer advised that the bluetooth is not compatabile with either of our <1 year old name brand cell phones.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far, so good! I'm a first time Lexus owner and the transition from internet inquiries to actual possession was very smooth and professional! I will admit, there's a bit more wind noise than I anticipated (based on the reviews); but it's still a quiet ride. I had to make adjustments to the way I would normally sit in order to be truly comfortable in the driver's seat. The navigation system seems adequate (I've compared it to Mapquest/Yahoo Maps and find them to be a bit more precise). I haven't connected the Bluetooth phone yet, so I can't comment on that feature. Actual gas mileage isn't bad for an SUV - I get about 20-23 MPG in the city, so I can't complain. :-) </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got this SUV about 4 weeks ago, and so far it is perfect. None of the noises or rattles that I read about and feared. With the 18 inch wheels, it handles pretty much like a car and not a truck. It also now has plenty of power. Very comfortable, and mileage is around 18-19, which I consider terrific for a new car weighing over 2 tons. So far, I think I made the right decision but it is still very early in the game.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power rear door is neat and handy. Power steering wheel is nice, as it gets out of the way to enter and exit. A/C excellent, and my car is black exterior and black interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this car for 1 week, and I am in love. It is plush, rides very nicely, and all the interior features work very well together (GPS, XM, Bluetooth, rear camera, entertainment system) - as one system, not as aggregate ones. My only complaint (minor) is that the driver seat does not go back enough for long legs. Also, I find the steering wheel a tad less comfortable than the Toyota Highlander (which this car looks so much like inside). Sound is good. Handling is excellent. Overall, a great buy. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leg lights while driving at night, phone accessibility in the wheel, Huge display for GPS, rear camera, and DVDs (when in park). Love the wood details.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far I am completely 100% satisfied. The ride is smooth and the power is strong. I was looking for comfort, styling, and reliability. The Lexus has all of them and then some.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the new 18" 7 spoke liquid graphite wheels. They really are a set up from the standard 18" wheels. The Nav is pretty user friendly and takes only a little time to get the hang of. The second row is very spacious and the seats even recline and move forward and back.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Walking up to it is it's own reward. Having the steering wheel slide out of the way when removing the key makes getting in and out all the easier. Put in the key and the seat, outside mirrors and steering wheel move back to one of two memorized locations. That first five seconds alone make the RX 350 better than my other rides. The all-wheel-drive keeps the tires locked to the pavement as the "killer corssover" eagerly accelerates under a heavy foot. With a minivan ride / height, you are not going to rail any corners. If you try, a bunch of gizmos conspire to take the spirit out of the drive. I suppose that's better than just flipping over but that's why it gets a 7 for performance.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Two words: Touchscreen navigation. It's nicely integrated and I hear that it accepts over 100 voice commands. I can only remember several at this early point in my ownership experience. The non-freon using air conditioning makes colder air than others. The dual zone feature makes us both happy</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As a BMW owner for many years, I felt it was time to try something new. I chose Lexus over the other competition and I must say that I am more than satisfied. The RX 350 is a smooth and quiet ride with good acceleration when on the move. My vehicle is equipped with the Premium Plus Package that includes the Voice Activated Nav System with Bluetooth and Rear Back-Up Camera. It has adequate trunk space with one touch automatic rear door (very helpful when you're carrying a bunch of groceries and of course it looks cool). You definitely get more value for your dollar with this vehicle than you do the competition. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Voice activated nav system; rear back-up camera; Bluetooth; wood trim in the interior; HID headlamps.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Although I have only had this vehicle for a few weeks, I can say without a doubt that it is the most dynamic vehicle I have ever driven. The quality is outstanding. I love everything about it. Couldn't be happier with this purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>With the push of a button you can raise and lower your rear door! Also love the safety feature of having a camera for full visibility when placing the vehicle in reverse.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought the RX 350 three weeks ago and I absolutely love it. I live in Pittsburgh and was able to test it out in the last snow/ice storm we had, and the car performed admirably. I couldn't be happier with it. Lots of cabin room, seating 4 or 5 is comfortable. Very good with pick-up, given that the V6 puts out 270 hp, and the RX's competitors are all V8s (easier on the wallet with gas too).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation system is really user friendly, and incredibly comprehensive and accurate. Ride is so smooth for an SUV. Black birds-eye maple interior was a great touch.</FAVORITE>
