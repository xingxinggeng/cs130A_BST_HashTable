<TEXT>I bought the Impreza in March 2008. This is my 5th Subaru, and I'm a big fan. So far over 15,000 miles, not one single problem. The 2.5L engine is great, and the car handles quiet well. Lots of cargo room with the rear seats down, and the optional roof rails and cargo carrier are helpful too. AWD is great, and over the 15K miles, I've gotten 26 MPG overall-- which I think is really good considering the AWD and larger 4-cyl engine. The wagon (yes, it's a wagon, not a hatchback!) looks great-the sedan is kinda boring. Interior design is nice, and the materials are an improvement over past Imprezas. Looking forward to many years and miles with this car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The growl of the boxer engine, AWD, exterior design, reliability, and the fun of driving it! And the fact that it's a Subaru!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Greetings! Winter of 2009 my wife and I drove on I-40 somewhere in Oklahoma and the road was coated with snow turned to ICE... it was around midnight and we were the only ones driving on I-40 at about 40-50 mph. All Semi- Truck/cars, etc. stuck along the side of the interstate due to the road condition, but our 2008 2.5i Impreza 5door kept going. The car took control whenever it sensed a "side-way" skid. The 2008 2.5i Impreza 5 door handled perfectly well on the snow & ice coated I-40 interstate... </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Subaru & what I've noticed is that wrx & sti owners have some special bond when they see another. Everyone always waves or smiles. Pretty cool. Those that know what a STi is, are always wanting to race & well sometimes I have to just let her run & they get to see my tail lights. ; ) I've taken it snowboarding several times even in white out conditions & my STi has never let me down. I've taken corners like it was on rails. I don't even sweat it anymore. So... definitely fun to drive & I hope to keep for a very long time because I can't see myself in another car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Subaru: 04 WRX (wish I never sold it!), 07 Forester XS, and this car. I'm driving 45,000 miles a year (crazy!) and averaging 30 MPG at usually 70-75 MPH, which is beyond the EPA reading! Cruise control is my friend. Can't beat the AWD in any weather. I HIGHLY recommend any Subaru model to anyone looking for a vehicle. No issues whatsoever with this car. -- If you're car shopping, just take a moment to drive some Subaru's, especially in a downpour or bad weather... I bet you'll be amazed! For comparison, do the same with other brands. This is when you'll notice more about the true feel of a vehicle versus a bright, dry, sunny day.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Manual transmission (auto was too weak); smooth ride (though it was too "washy" until I adjusted to the ride height) after having sports cars; Premium Pkg & lower seats (for the shifting); Body Style; AWD; Because Subaru makes awesome reliable products.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>All the reviews about paint problems are true. I bought this car 9 months ago and can't believe how fragile the paint is. I've only got 6,000 miles on the car and it looks like there's 4 years of abrasion on the rear qtr panels. Severe chips on the hood and front of the vehicle. Hopefully Subaru officials read these reviews and do something because they're losing customers. This was my first and believe me last Subaru. Unless you want to pay for a total repaint every 3 years stay away from this car. Other Subaru models have the same problem. Oh and do something about the ridiculously low passenger seat and what's with the holes in the front bumper?? Not all states have front license plates!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Biggest complaint: rear drum brakes! We don't drive too many miles but we do have to deal with snow. This model is underpowered and boring to drive, but it gets you to your destination safely and reliably in northern winters. We have averaged 23.5 mpg and have had zero maintenance issues. The interior is cheap but well put together and functional. The rear hatch is poorly designed, when you shut it you either push too light and doesn't latch or push too hard and it rubs the bumper. I am not happy with the amount of rust developing in the suspension, and may take it in to complain about that. The paint looks great but it chips and scratches very easily.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased this car and after 21 months with it I would highly recommend it. It has been completely reliable and has returned decent fuel economy (25 mpg overall). The only major nit I have to pick is with the passenger seat. It is mounted way too low and has no height adjustment. Makes one feel like a four year old trying to see out.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior lay out is attractive. This car is very nice looking in Newport blue. I like that the hood stays up with out a prop rod (it uses hydraulic cylinders). The light color interior is very rich looking.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had car for over a year now with 30k miles. I like it with no major complaints, just minor ones. Handling is a little soft, but it gives a very nice ride. After driving manual for 18 years, I feel the 4spd Auto Trans is very weak. Should have gone with the 5M, I really miss it. That is my mistake. I have a black two tone and the paint scratches very, very easily, more so than any car I have ever had. AWD is great, and the VDC is really cool. Next year snow tires will go on, which should really improve the AWD. Even with AWD, 17 inch, wide, low profile tires, aren't the best in the snow. After 30k miles, averaging about 27mpg in all sorts of driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD of course. Nice gas mileage. Very roomy inside (except for hatch with all seats up), with nice head room. Looks great except from directly behind (not a big fan of the clear rear lights). So far very dependable, no issues at all. Lots of features for 20k.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking for a car that was a great performing sports car, fun to drive, good daily driver, 4 doors, could be used to get groceries, and did not scream ?sports car?. I found the perfect combination with the my black 2008 WRX STI with silver BBS wheels. This car just rocks. Here are the things that I like best about this car: 1. The ability to tune the car between ?intelligent? for daily driving and sport and serious fun with Sport # -- nothing like it on the market. 2. The ability to change the differential for power to the front and rear wheels - tons of options, tons of power, this car moves! 3. The clean simple design of the interior - very nice but not complicated and overdone.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Daily Driver</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I was looking for a reliable, economical, fun daily driver - a combination surprisingly hard to find. Enter the Impreza: AWD, fun, safe, good looking, good mpg, sporty, practical, good standard equipment. Was ready to buy the 2.5i after the test drive, but told dealer I needed to give the WRX a chance at least. 15 minutes behind the wheel and I was sold. WRX = 2.5i + fun (read: fast!), great standard equipment, decent mpgs. Add the Premium Package for a list of great amenities that can't be beat for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD and turbo! MPG easily worth the fun factor. Very exciting to drive. Exterior design - I love it. Projector headlights, body kit, heated mirrors, wipers, and seats. In-dash CD changer. MP3/aux-in jack. Perfect mix of practicality and joyride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I used to have a 1994 ford escort that my parents bought me, and now I bought the Outback Sport and I love it. I've gone just over 500 miles on it and the dash computer is telling me in city driving i'm getting 21.3 average. Every other day it's been climbing, I've only taken it on the highway three times. I was going to go with the Mazda 3 until i saw this car and I went with this one. And I'm very happy with my choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car handles better than my last car (1999 Passat). It holds the road well and has good power across the RPM range. I would like more cargo space, but knew I was making a compromise for reasons of cost. Car looks sharp in the Outback trim and is well equipped. I wish the driver's seat had adjustable lumbar support and the ability to angle the headrest back. Could also benefit from a telescoping wheel. Overall happy with my purchase 1000 miles into ownership.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, road handling (grips like crazy in corners), very good low-end power for a relatively small engine, AWD for the snow, available manual transmission, price is good for the features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought a Base w/out premium package a few days ago. Options: iPod, painted guards, mats. I love the front independent and wishbone, sooo smooth. Especially in Seattle where there are lots of hills, cobble stone brick roads and potholes. 5 star crash test rating. Can't wait to get to the mountain passes and take advantage of the AWD. This is simply much more value then any other car in class. If you can afford Premium w/ VCD do it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance! Quick off the line and revs fast. Built sporty even though it's not the Sport or WRX hatchback design offers a more functional space as opposed to sedan. LED tail lights, get em! Standard airbags for front and back seat side impact. Lot's of standard options, HIDs! AWD!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the car a month ago and love every minute driving the WRX. My 2nd Subaru (2005 OBS) and WRX higher quality materials, cluster, seats. Much faster too. Extraordinarily spacious with 5 door, able to fit a whole patio furniture set no problem. Living in NYC, wanted AWD and looked at Audis but the 5 door WRX balances driving fun with practicality of everyday living for a little less money. I have grey metallic and its beautiful, thought the OBS was bland w/o the scoop. Look forward to each moment behind the wheel. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So far the car has been great. Drove it in a bad snow storm (10-14") and it handled great. I had to push really hard in order for the stability control to kick in. When did, the car straighened out beautifuily. The Outback sport has a slightly raised suspension over the stnd impreza allow it to be taken light offroading plus that allows the snow to not build up as much when driving. The radio is ok, but comes alive when using the aux for a MP3 player. Cargo space is great, seats are comfortable and heated. Dash and conrols are layed out very nice. Gas mileage is decent for a new AWD car. Avg 24 w/mainly city driving. Love the MPG gauge too! Makes you more aware of how you dirve.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The silver two tone is nice looking along with the 17" rims. AWD (handling), heat seats, side mirros and wipers, all weather floor mats, overall feel of the car! The use of regular gas rather than premium which is what a lot of cars seem to be doing these days.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have my Outback manual for 1000 miles now and it is a pleasure to drive. The car is solid as a rock and the ride is very controlled but not too stiff even with the 17" wheels. The interior is laid out well and is also very comfortable to drive. Could use a bigger armest and lumbar control. The passenger seat could be a bit higher. Other than that it is very quick and gets good gas mileage, so far average 25 mpg in mixed relaxed driving. On highway it will get close to 30 mpg. It's not even broken in yet. I had a 2002 Impreza Outback and they don't even compare. This new one is that much better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth stick shift and clutch. Nice hill assist function. Great gas mileage for AWD car. Comfortable driver seat. Rear seat is also nice size. Overall quiet and solid car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>All I needed was practical transportation. Something to get me from point a to point b safely and economcally. I tried the Scion xB, Mazda 3, Rabbit S 4 dr, and the Saturn Astra. I don't think you could go wrong with any of them. But, when you factored in what you can buy them for they were dealing on the Subaru plus you get AWD which was a huge selling point. The VW is supposed to be the gold standard at this price point, but the Subie was IMHO less plasticky. I needed the versatility of a hatchback, hence the 5 door. I must admit though the xB looked huge on the inside. But I got more car for the money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased this OBS 4A a week ago and now have almost 600 miles on it. Nice little car with a roomier interior than one would think. My first Subaru (I've owned 62 vehicles including all the German and most Japanese). I'm averaging 25 mpg in mixed driving and expect it to go up another 10 to 15%. The OBS has good content. It does lean a bit as others have mentioned but not to a point of concern. My only complaint is of some dash plastic vibrations, lack of a sorely needed 5 speed auto, and lack of moonroof. I was aware of the latter two shortcomings going into this and purchased it anyway. I expect my OBS to serve my purposes for a couple of years and I am really quite pleased with the vehicle</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased this car 2 weeks ago and almost reached 1000 miles. Gas mileage has been a little better than expected--my combined driving right now gets me 25.2 mpg (I don't baby the car but I am not too aggressive either). Interior is very nice--audio and climate controls are well designed, very decent quality, and more spacious than previous generation. Even without the sports grille, I think the exterior is decent.

<TEXT>Fun to drive, plenty of torque, manual trans a little clunky, needs to be easier to shift, headliner seems to be made of cardboard, plastics on dash are not top notch. Instrument cluster is good, reminds me of Audi. Test drove Civic Si, Subaru is quieter, better ride and don't have to shift as often, also get more torque at lower rpm, seats are more comfy and easier to clean, more back seat room. I picked WRX even though it cost several thousand more for its driving character and I like the looks of the sedan.</TEXT>

My salesman pointed this out to me on a just delivered silver Outback sport. I look the looks of it. It drives so solid. If you haven't driven a Subaru before take a test drive, it is the oddest feeling and it is great. Try this car and you will buy one. The winter package is only available on the outback sport and the WRx. Interior is great and the car handles very well. No regrets buying one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2008 OBS, as with the Impreza/WRX family, is substantially changed from 2007. Most of the major issues on the earlier models (interior quality, handling, braking, climate control, tires, etc.) have been addressed, mostly successfully. The 2008, IMO, is far closer to the ideal of a WRX w/o the turbo than past attempts. The OBS's ability to travel through rain/sleet/snow, etc. is superb. Still, its appeal will likely be limited to those who value 4wd and a sporty image over size, utility, and gas mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car beats the Matrix,Fit and Versa when it comes to stability, power and performance. Try all the above in Wisconsin weather and you would know what I am talking about. Try the Impreza AWD and you would know why the trucks rush past you without caring much about the snow. It is the AWD, baby! The only thing I care about is the mileage. It is low but the car can give you more than 20 mpg driven in city conditions. It is as powerful as my Camry and does groan as others do when you hit the gas. The pickup is instant. The steering does not vibrate when on highway. Compared to all the above wagons this one is the best, safest and the fastest.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far I have really enjoyed my new Impreza (3000k miles/two months). I opted for the simplified and economical 2.5i auto 5-door in dark grey with a center armrest ext. I've already added on the aux jack, rear seat net, and rear bumper cover. It's definitely a joy to drive around. It makes you hate city traffic, bored with open highway, and eager for some empty country roads. It would be nice if it were a bit quieter, but then it would be a Saab. I originally wanted a Saab 9-2 a few years ago, but it was discontinued and this car substitues perfectly, with the added bonus of AWD. I'm getting 25 mpg on mixed travel. Measuring highway trips gets me 28-32 mpg. Had absolutely no problems.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Lots to love about this car. For the low price, you get AWD, tight suspension, pretty good MPG, fun, and room. The base stereo (4 speakers) is actually OK and doesn't distort at high volume. I will be adding the Subaru subwoofer soon. The ride is great and the car feels like it has claws that attack the road. 5 spd is fun since you have more control. Trunk loses some space as it raises toward the back because of the new double wishbone suspension. Interior is good for the price. Plastic used on the door and dash, but for $16k I don't mind. I like the looks of the 2007 better, but oh well. The 08 is more "grown up" looking. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MPG readout. It really helps to conserve gas when wanted. I am getting 32 mpg hwy and 26 mpg city when driving conservatively. I love it with AWD! If I decide to have some fun on snowy roads, mileage drops to about 23. Still good for AWD.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>For the money the car can't be beat! Even with the lower fuel enconomy, Honda and Toyota don't compare. Upgrading to the Premium package is worth the extra $. I've only put 400 miles since buying it and have yet to run above 4000 rpm (break-in period) but the engine is itching to perform! The standard AWD is perfect for Colorado weather. Seats are much more comfortable in '08 than earlier models! Great car and very happy so far!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We got the 2008 hatchback and have 1700 miles on it. Handling and comfort are excellent, it's really fun to drive. Performance getting better every day as the engine gets broken in. Used it in some deep snow, traction is great, it climbs steep snow covered roads with ease. So far the mileage is the only gripe. Getting about 20 around town and 26 - 27 on the highway. Hope it gets better when it fully broken in and the weather warms up. Excellent car, we had 2 Legacys before but the new Impreza is roomier than the old model. I'd buy another.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my Forester X for a WRX sedan and couldn't be happier with the decision. The WRX is a terrific combination for a cold weather city like Chicago: rocket like power and superb handling mated with all wheel drive and excellent cargo capacity. I'm finding that the WRX has bigger back seats and tons of trunk space so I'm not missing the wagon back. The refinement and finish and quiet ride of the interior is a world apart from the Forester. The only other car I would have considered would have been the Mazdaspeed3 but then I would have the awd for the weather. All around I don't think there is anything comparable in the price range.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All wheel drive, turbo, low tach range turbo boost that minimizes the turbo surge that the older WRXs had, quality finishes in the interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was in the market for a daily driver that was reliable, had excellent crash test ratings, affordable, and was fun to drive. The Subaru WRX was the answer. My wife and two kids fit comfortably in the car and the trunk has just the right amount of cargo space for our gear for our weekend getaway trips. This includes luggage, a stroller, and other miscellaneous things for the kids.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I took delivery of a plain, no-frills, 5 door, 5 sp 08 WRX this past Monday. It isn't as "solid" (heavy) or quiet or plush as my old car. In fact, I have a strong sense of deja-vu with a '78 Corolla we once owned. It isn't a hard riding racer. It is a simple car that is very comfortable, quicker than most and a whole lot of FUN. The more I drive it, the more I like it. I was shocked by my first tank's mileage, then I realized that if I got off the boost once in a while, I really could get 22.5 mpg in town. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A lot of ooomph in that motor! Steering is dead-on. Seats are great. Back seat room is terrific. I really like the styling. The hill assist is great here in hill country.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm the face of the "new" Impreza owner: a regular Joe, not a rally-race-enthusiast. I had my last car for ~10 years, & I hope to keep this one even longer. I don't care what the fascia looks like, so long as it's not hideous, & I'm not impressed with faux luxury touches on the inside, like aluminum trim or cow-hide. I want a practical but fun car, on a budget. Scooby-Rex fits that bill perfectly. It has been incredibly fun to drive, lots of power even below 3K rpm, handles like a dream, satisfying engine growl yet reasonably low road noise, and the sport-shift automatic is the best of both worlds. My biggest complaint is 18mpg in mixed driving, and the related 4-spd transmission. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It's super safe with front, side and curtain airbags and child latches in rear seat. It's super fast with a turbo that has some lag but the most hustle at the price range and even into the next. The AWD is also safe and fast, gripping corners, bends, and off-ramps. Driving in the rain feels like the traction is that of a tank and its control is superb like the feel of a running back on a highway full of blockers. Interior material is much more durable than other imprezas. Highway driving at 23.5 mpg, city at 18.6 right now, the trip computer allows for an average mpg reading. Very roomy and easy to make use of the hatch area.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turbo, this is a porsche chaser. AWD, rain and unpaved roads = no match. VDC, can be turned off for showing off and turned on for all other types. Interior, quality seat material, cockpit is uniquely both spacious and snug with a warm glowing red dash. Wheels, nice 17" rim design. Great fast wipers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a 2004 Outback Sport (which I loved dearly) and was nervous about the new model given the bad press on the internet over looks & worse handling. I drove the WRX, came back to the dealer smiling, and lost all doubts -- it's a great car. Like most Subarus it's neither hideous or gorgeous -- a few years behind the competition in styling and execution -- but it is solid, versatile, hopefully as trouble-free as my '04 was. Yes, it is more softly sprung than my old car but honestly I don't miss the go-kart ride. This car does however have a bit more 'float' in fast turns than my old car due to the softer springs - don't like that. Still sticks great, not a dealbreaker! Give the car a look.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Improvements from my '04 OBS: normal back seat, wider, but shorter, with longer wheelbase. Tons of power, handles well in most situations. Subaru AWD is amazing -- haven't been in snow yet, but my '04 was amazing in snow and mud - never slid, never out of control. Comfy (but lower) drivers seat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This may sound weird but this is my second new car as a 19 year old kid. My other car was a sports car as well but I kept getting pulled over in it because it looked like a sport car. I knew the reputaion of the WRX and decided to go with it because its new remodeled look has more of a business edge to it. It's a cross between a camry and a 5 series BMW i say. I love the car so far and have had it about a week. There have been no problems... still has a turbo lag but hey it is a turbo.

It does pain me to see Subaru in trying to popularize this model among the masses has missed a few critical details. In order to win the masses, a few options and standard accessories are missing which I will mention below. However, Subaru is still the best for the money!

<TEXT>This is my third Subaru and I traded in a 2001 Legacy Sedan Limited Edition for it two weeks ago. I selected the 2008 Impreza because of its looks, performance, price and safety features. I test drove a 2007 Impreza Outback Wagon (the dealer was trying to give it away) and was not happy with its performance or appearance. The re-designed 2008 has an upgraded appearance and performance with a sport car attitude. While it may not look like a traditional Impreza, I think the exterior is sharper than the 2008 Legacy Sedans (looks like a VW Jetta). I am very happy with my selection, its driveability and (of course) its AWD and great handling (better than the Legacy).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Have to get the Premium Package (it's worth the extra $1200 or so). You get six disc CD, upgraded interior, fog lamps, & vehicle dynamics control (VDC)-a great safety feature. Also has 16" aluminum alloy wheel, dual front air bags, side curtain airbags, 4 wheel DISC brakes.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is a lot of fun to drive, and if your drive normally pits you against the elements, it is especially worth considering. So far, I'm enjoying it a whole lot. Premium features incorporated in the Outback Sport are very worthwhile. VDC/TCS addition in an under $20,000 AWD car is impressive. Yes, I have a 2000 RS 2.5 that beats this car in handling, but that is not something that happened between model years. From my perspective, whatever compromises were made were worth it.

<TEXT>Picked up the 2008 Imp 2.5i just a few days ago. Not going to lie, at first I hated the new body style, however it grew on me (well everything except for the tail lights, hence the 8 on exterior styling). Still being in the break in period, I haven't had the opportunity to really get on the engine, but I have high expectations. Very comfortable car. The seats are much better than my old Explorer. The car is about a million times more fun to drive as well. It handles very well, carving apart roads in West Virginia and still getting around 23 mpg in the city. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet cabin, responsive engine, excellent handling and the premium sound system is pretty sweet. For the price, it can't be beat. Sporty little car with AWD!

<TEXT>After researching cars for under $20,000 including the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic I ended up buying the new 2008 Impreza which has a brand new body style this year. I read a few reviews that said this car lacks style but I feel the exact opposite. I got the silver 2.5i sedan premium package with a spoiler and it looks awesome, very stylish. Plus the biggest feature the Corolla and Civic does not have is the all wheel drive which makes the car extremely safe and fun to drive. If you're looking for a great car under $20,000 I highly recommend the 2008 Impreza, and this comes from a guy who never pictured himself in a Subaru!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have just over 1,600 miles on this car and I have grown to love it. The performance levels are so high that you have to get used to them before you can start enjoying the car as a driver's car. It is a wonderful car to drive around town and smooth and quiet on the highway. The suspension is communicative without being harsh. You get the information you need through the wheel and your seat, but it isn't in the sharp way of some performance cars. The gear change can be notchy, but the engine is a torque monster with plenty of power from 2,500 RPM. The sound system is nice, although it could use a subwoofer as standard and not an option. I am getting around 26 MPG mostly country driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the AWD and the turbo. The sound system is really nice and I have actually found a situation where I needed to waste some time and watched an iPod video on the monitor.

<TEXT>Yeah, the handling isn't tight as my old 2.5 RS Impreza but its almost as much fun to drive with a much improved ride, a good tradeoff if you drive on rough roads. Also the overall interior design, room, and build quality is better too. It's almost as big as a Legacy on the inside. The fuel economy is better than the EPA figures. I get 27 mpg in mixed city/highway driving and the motor is not even broken in yet. Get the manual transmission unless you totally hate them. The four speed mutes the performance of the spunky motor a bit too much. The manual 2.5is almost make you forget about the WRX when you consider insurance and $3.25 premium gas.</TEXT>

Horrible visibility, especially at night, you can't see anything because of the position of the pillars and the size of the mirrors. Painfully weak and horrendously thirsty engine, you'll be lucky to get 22/23mpg on the highway, driving in cruise control at 65. Quality of materials inside is absolutely appalling, cheap plastics all around! Clutch pedal has no precision making it difficult to drive smoothly.

I was told this was to be fixed by a painter, but even he agreed that the paint was too far beyond repair for a minor touch-up. Needless to say I'm going to have to sue the dealership and have them investigated for fraud if this isn't fixed. Thanks for Subaru for not standing behind your cars at all. I feel bad for anyone who is going through the same problems with this company since there is a known paint problem with the 2008 Imprezas.</TEXT>

Car is perfect for a single person - quick and fun, 4 door versatility, adaptable to add luggage racks. Sporty and stylish enough, but kinda flies under the police radar cuz it isn't TOO flashy. I did have a cooling hose issue (factory didn't tighten it), and it does 'rattle' a bit which is scary considering I traded in a 1997 Ford Probe that didn't rattle at all, but overall a very great car in my opinion if it holds up over time.

<TEXT>This is my first Subaru, I bought it because I wanted a fairly inexpensive car with AWD and a manual transmission and I liked the style of the hatch. The car is a pleasure to drive and gets decent fuel mileage but service and build quality is pretty poor. The car has a large number squeaks and rattles. The paint on the car is terrible, the lower parts of the rear doors and the are behind them have been chipped away so badly after 16,000 miles I already have rust forming. This has to be a design flaw since the front wheels kick everything up on the side of the car and the cheap thin paint chips the second anything touched it. Fuel door release broke has broken twice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car brand-new in September 2008 to replace my 2005 Impreza RS wagon. I love the looks of the new car versus the old - it was long due for a ground-up remodel and they (IMHO) got it right. Upgrading to the outback sport was a no-brainer considering what the package gives you; roof-rack, larger 17" alloy wheels, a far better stereo, 4 wheel disc brakes, upgraded suspension and the very slick VDC. Oh, and you get to say 'Outback' even though it's also an Impreza. :) So Subaru calls it a wagon. Why? It doesn't look or smell or taste like a wagon. With the seats up & even with a mild trip to the market, it can't even stuff like a wagon. Call it what it is. A great little 5 door!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Well thought out interior. Nice two-color paint schemes in this model. Keyless entry. Trunk release on the remote as well. Good stereo. Larger alloy rims are visually well designed. Rubberized pad on the bumper for the 5th door. VDC is amazing in the snow. Hood even stays open all by itself. :)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> I recently brought the car in for some warranty issues as well as a software recall on the ECU. I mentioned to the advisor that when my spouse or 13 yr. daughter sit in the passenger seat, the airbag off light illuminates. They assured me everything was fine and that I could have them take off of school and work to come in and they would teach them how to sit correctly. With some persistence the dealer called me back and confirmed that they cannot get the light to say on with ~105-129lbs. on a brand new STI. The NHTSA says that they never tested that car. SOA told me they did, but it turns out the base Impreza was. Either way, SOA said they will not change anything.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this car as my commuter ride - 90 miles/day on mostly open roads, only a hand full of lights and stops. Believe it or not, I'm averaging 34-35 mpg for the last 10k miles. This likely has a lot to do with the lack of stop and go and the elevation (5500-7200'). I'm still amazed that an AWD car can be this nimble, get this kind of mileage, and do so well in the mountains.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle because of its style, consumer reports of reliability, and all-wheel drive. I got the premium package which was mostly worth it. This car is very fun to drive, it is my primary vehicle. It is more enjoyable and more agile than a police cruiser... and faster. If I could buy one and donate it to the police department for me to drive, I would. It is very reliable and the AWD kicks when I visit family in Michigan where snow is a problem for cars without it. I spent 2 weeks researching cars in the 20K-30K range and this was the best one overall. Ratings were better, looks were better, and I couldn't find any serious negative reviews.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, acceleration, sporty looks, seats, simplicity, reliability, well-designed and doesn't feel cheaply made, nothing rattles, AWD. It is a very sturdy car. All-weather mats are nice. Gets 40 MPG if you scoot up behind a semi-truck at 55 MPH. Lots of airbags too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car!! I am a sales rep and drive it a lot, and extremely hard. I actually got 38.5 MPG at 60 mph on the freeway during break in. But after break in I began to drive it like I stole it and still avg 22.5 mpg with 50/50 miles around town and highway, and hitting 6000 rpm all the time. The 09 has stiffer springs and 40 more BHP.

<TEXT>I purchased my 2008 STI in March of 2008 and have been completely satisfied. It is fast, useful and the 2008 avoided the "boy racer" wing of older STIs. Some say the car has gotten soft - as compared to what? If a far better car and as fast as my 2004 Mustang Cobra and a powerful car with all wheel drive is simply amazing. The dealers are now discounting the STI heavily - my advice is if you want performance and durability - test drive the new STI - and gas mileage is 20-22 if you exercise some control.

<TEXT>I got mine more than year ago. So far very pleased by the price/quality/value. I averaged ~22mpg (~6000 city + ~3000 highway) and I'm OK with that considering AWD, 2.5 engine and automatic transmission. I got Dark Gray Metallic colored car with dark interior. So far no mechanical problems - I've changed only oil and air filters. I believe that the engine is great and allows some fun on the road but could get better performance with manual transmission. Unfortunately my wife prefers automatic so we got less fun.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is generally very good. I got it for an excellent price, even in its first year. I really like the interior design and layout and the great looking and useful hatch bodystyle. The interior generally is nice for the $ but I think the red lighting is juvenile and hard to read. The main problem with the car is the short-stroke engine combined with interia of AWD system makes it a torqueless dog both around town and on the highway. I can't fathom why the engineers would set it up that way. At least the short gearing kind of makes up for it, but then it ends up feeling like it needs a 6th gear. All together it drives and rides pretty well and is comfortable. MPG isn't bad for AWD.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Subaru and I am very happy with it. I traded in a 2006 Civic that went nowhere in the snow and during Minnesota winters that's not a good thing. I decided on this because of the AWD, the looks and the price. I am impressed with the ride, and quality of the car and it has great pick up, it's pretty quick! Not much road noise either. Feels like a nice solid ride. Cant wait for some snow to test it out. It gets a pretty solid 26 mpg city and when I drove a 200 mile trip all highway it got a solid 32 mpg which I think is great for this car and it isn't even broken in yet. Overall happy with my purchase and will buy a Subaru again, maybe a Legacy next time :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only owned the vehicle for a few days, but it is incredibly solid and quite fun to drive. Going from a Z28 to a four-cylinder was a bit daunting, but the car feels spritely for 170 ponies. Controls are well laid-out and easy to figure out, and the car responds as though it is meant to be driven. After test-driving a few vehicles (Corolla, Civic, etc) the Subaru was by far the most fun and felt like the best value for my dollar, especially with the full-time All Wheel Drive. The stereo is a bit tinny (base model), but can be easily upgraded. Absolutely opt for the auxiliary-input if you get the base model for MP3 connectivity - it's a blast!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Downshifting and blipping the throttle around corners plants the car firmly - good road manners under any driving conditions, and better than projected fuel economy (I've been getting ~25 combined city/highway and the car is still being broken in) - expecting 30+ with average driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Subaru, and I'm impressed so far. The ride is a near perfect blend of road feel and impact isolation. Not even major potholes transfer into the car as harsh impacts. The steering and brakes are almost perfectly weighted, though I had hoped for more road feel and feedback from a Subaru. They got most of the interior details right (the steering wheel buttons light up!), but some cost cutting is definitely visible. I think they did it in the right places, it's certainly forgivable in exchange for AWD and an engine that makes 30 more HP than competitors do. Overall it drives very nicely for a sub-20K car is getting 5-6 MPG more than my CR-V that had the same MPG rating.</TEXT>

<TEXT>New 2008 STi is unquestionably a blast to drive, and I actually prefer the new, toned-down body style. That said, I'm finding it a difficult daily driver. Not because of the transmission (clunky) or the gas mileage (mediocre), but because the car rattles so, so, so much. I've only owned it for a few months, and it is barely out of its break-in period. But it seems like every time I get in the car, it has developed a new interior rattle. No use turning to dealerships for help, in my experience, as they either fail to fix the problem, or claim to be unable to replicate it. Just how high do you have to turn the stereo and a/c to drown out all those rattles, boys?</TEXT>

For a small car the larger than normal 170 HP really gives it some kick and the AWD and stability control make it do amazing things. Best car in its class. In fact it outclasses everything else which is why it is so under reviewed. It must just confuse auto reporters about how this car fits in with everything else.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I searched for the most fuel economic (freeway), AWD (for frequent dirt-roading/all weather) on the market with good interior loading capacity. This car blew the SX4 Crossover AWD (which I test drove) out of the water, especially in loading capacity, and was ~$10k cheaper than the Ford Escape Hybrid (which was great to drive but had about the same fuel economy as the Impreza 180hp). I've already driven through fields with my Outback Sport in wet weather and it plowed through it like a champion - I can't wait for snow to come this season! This car has already been superior on road trips. I've noticed the gear ratio used makes for a slight lack of power switching from 4th to 5th. @ ~50-55 mph</TEXT>

Higher RPMs the engine was getting tired so I added a Subaru Performance Tuning Exhaust and a K&N air filter that did the trick and it pulls hard all the way to redline now with no flat spots like before. Short throw shifter took away "notchyness" as well as a more comfortable MOMO shift knob. I have 3000 miles on the car and it is a dream to drive, and has a great ride. If you need something more hardcore buy an STI or the 09 WRX next year if you must have gumball tires that last 20 minutes! </TEXT>

It produces punchy low end torque, but levels off the higher you rev. There's really no point in revving it over 3500 rpm! The slick shifter, loose clutch, and peppy engine make it ridiculously easy to drive. It's obvious that Subaru focused on utility and comfort for this model, at the sacrifice of agility and handling, but the full time all wheel drive rules!</TEXT>

<TEXT>OK, I've heard all you drivers of other makes talk about performance and fuel economy; this is a very competitive market segment. But, if you could give up very little speed and gas mileage, in exchange for top safety ratings, reliability and engineering, would you do it? Now, factor in rain and snow. Not only is Subaru the best bad weather vehicle that is practical for daily driving, it will outperform the rest of the market segment when road conditions are tough. The symmetrical AWD system does not introduce any of the instability or inefficiency cause by the systems that divert power off-axis. Pick a nasty day and go drive one to see for yourself.</TEXT>

This car handles better, rides quieter and has the options that sealed the deal. I love the fact that my five door can bee a family car and a performance car at the same time. I have now switched to seeing how well I can make the MPG go up with the nav display. It can get around 30 or maybe a tad more on the highway. If you want to race, don't expect stellar gas mpg performance. Stay out of the turbo and things get pretty nice for the wallet. Very satisfied with this car and the dealership of purchase.</TEXT>

Seats are comfy. The tires should be upgraded at some point, however so far they are evenly wearing. Trunk in sedan is short where it meets the back seats. The brakes don't seem quite as "grippy" as one would assume. Also road noise is loud in this car, but I can deal with that. The stereo is somewhat weak but the engine is wonderful to listen to. Overall very satisfied with purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plain and simply, the 2.5L turbocharged Boxer engine. Installed a CAI and SPT exhaust and you can hear the engine come to life. No need for the radio b/c this is awesome to listen to. Also a lot of Subaru aftermarket accessories can be added easily, as most wiring is already done (ex sat radio).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my third STI. So far it is my favorite! It is more grown up now, which is perfect for someone that has graduated from the blue interior and giant wing (which I STILL love). The hatch is really great for hauling around stuff or for a guy with a family. The car has lost a little edge from the old one, but for my needs, it's for the better. I do recommend a 3M clear bra as the water based paint is still not as durable as it should be and rock chips WILL happen. The car is a little more incognito because of the new shape and isn't quite as much of a cop magnet. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Red glowing STI in front of shifter DCCD system, SI drive (good for gas prices nowadays) space of hatch, and of course, the Turbo Boxer 4!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have put 8,500 miles since Jan and am happy with overall quality. Mileage averages 24 mpg mixed city/hwy. Have gotten 32 mpg at 65 mph and 27 at 75 mph. Loved the AWD in winter, handles great on ice. Back seat passengers always comment on comfort and room. But the driver's seat is not good for me. Sore back since I bought it. I want to love this car, but the backache doesn't let me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Meets all of the following: AWD, good gas mileage (for an AWD), reliability, safety, and price below $20K. I studied (e.g., Consumers Reports, JD Powers, Edmunds.com, etc.) and found no rivals...mostly because Versa, Fit, Yaris, Mazda 3 do not offer all the above. There are better stereos, acceleration and MPG out there, but nothing that rates at least a "good" at everything. Most new owners are excited with their cars, so only time will tell the truth. However, my 3 months/5,0000 miles experience support the claims of other professional reviews and the positive history of this car model. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fit & finish. Gas mileage I get for an AWD is 25 mpg combined. Ergonomics. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is fantastic. The clutch is a little heavy/precise, but it's fun to learn the nuances. The ride, even with STi pink springs is smooth and predictable. With the springs, the stock roll is gone. Mileage is surprising - about 25mpg, and I'm suburban commuter, 28 miles/day at 40mph avg. Stay out of boost, and it'll give you economy. I look forward to driving this car every day. It's noticable, but not showy. It's fast, but not impractical. It's comfortable, but not plush. Heated seats are always great in cold climates - I wish these extended to the upper back more. Some light mods make this car look/sound phenomenal. Slightly lower, tint, sport grill, cat- back (SPT).</TEXT>

I have the 5M and all I can say is that I love my car. It is awesome! This is the fist year that I am actually looking forward to the winter here in New York. Can't wait for the snow! I usually hate driving in the snow but after all the you tube videos of the Impreza's in the snow I cant wait! The only thing I regret is not getting the WRX sti. I might try to trade mine back in for it but not sure. Other than that I love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car. I have owned a Legacy and Outback Wagon, and the 2008 Impreza WRX is a different car - but still a Subaru in all respects. The WRX is fast, fun, and AWD.

<TEXT>After reading extensive reviews and test driving both the 2008 STI and the new Evo, I purchased the STI. Evo is more boy racer vs. STi's maturity. The STi is a pleasure to drive. The seats are more comfortable than the Evo's for longer distance driving. STi also has 3 different driving modes depending on what type of driving you want to do - Intelligent/everyday vs. Sport vs. Sport Sharp, a cutting edge racing type driving mode that gobbles up a tank of 93 octane like nobody's business! The Sport Sharp mode is like flipping a nitrous switch and boosts the already awesome acceleration over 3500 rpm. I actually have the little woman thinking that my, sorry, "our" new STI is a great family car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance, truly a pleasure to drive, exhaust note, practicality, cargo space. The styling is also great, and I get a lot of thumbs up from people checking the car out. Interior has a nice fit & finish too, unlike Evo's heavily plastic interior. This is an awesome year round sports car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car does a lot of things really really well, but a couple of things keep me from giving it a 10 across the board. First and foremost, with 450 miles on it we have already developed a squeak/rattle from the dashboard. We've also had the radiator light come on for a minute when the car was only on for about 2 minutes. Other than that I love the way the car looks and it is very comfortable to drive. It's not quick, but it has enough power and it handles decently. The automatic trans seems a bit clunky, but I'm used to a manual so perhaps it's just me adjusting. For 21k I don't think there are too many cars out there that offer the features the Impreza does and also have 4WD/AWD.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car. The only problem is the gas mileage, so I bought the manual and with some careful driving I can stay at 26 MPG, even in the city. Interior plastic feels cheap, but is study enough. For its engine size and weight it performs well enough though not exemplary. The Nissan Altima was a better ride but lacked electronic stability control (called VDC in the Subarus). Performance package is a must-have, it replaces the rear brake drums with safer discs. Also adds in-wheel radio controls and a six-CD in-dash changer. Shocks are pretty good. Tight fit for rear passengers. Corners very well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A list of safety features as long as my arm, especially with the performance package replacing the rear brake drums with discs. The in-wheel radio controls are great. Looks great. Wish I'd bought the WRX model. Hill assist starter, and audio-in port are great standard features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this car for two weeks. It is quite different than my last car (95 Toyota Camry), so it's taken some getting used to. My only complaints are road noise on the highway, and uncomfortable headrests (they push your head forward). I like the way it looks and drives so far, but we'll see after the upcoming winter. That's the reason why I bought a Subaru, for all the bad weather driving we do in New England.</TEXT>

<FAVORITE>This car has an incredible turning radius. Parking is a cinch. Sound system is adequate, but nothing special. Folding rear seats are great and backseat legroom is pretty good, too.

<TEXT>2 1/2 weeks old, 650 miles, and loving every one of them. This is my second Subaru. I have a 2004 Legacy Limited Edition and I had to get another. I love my Impreza. Getting about 28 highway and about 24 city mpg. I could not ask for more. Super fun to drive. 170 hp and feels like more. To this day both of my Subarus handled and held the road like no other car I have ever driven! Can't wait for the first New Jersey snowstorm! Dark Grey Metallic paint is beautiful and everyone says so. Wish it had fog lights, they will be coming soon! Great car for a great value</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is great. One of the best deals if your looking for something in the 20-21k range. Very comfortable and very quiet ride. Suspension should be a little titer on corners but other than that, I love the car. Going on 4k miles now and have avg 24-25 consistently. Had one snow storm and the car didn't flinch once. The vdc works great and kept the car calm under snowy cornering. The seats fold flat down and make trips to lowes and hd a sinch. And u can hook up roof racks to the top with the pre-cut sockets on the rails. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it! The stick shift is fun and helps to maintain good fuel economy. I have been getting on average 26 to 28 MPG mixed highway/city driving. The car is very roomy, and the seats are comfortable. The ride is greatly improved over previous years with the new rear wishbone suspension and the outback raised suspension helps too. The acceleration is a bit slow but I am more intersted in saving gas these days. The maneuverability of the vehicle is great too, very responsive. I live in Vermont and I got his car because I knew it would help out in the winter season and that to me is worth a sacrifice in fuel economy. Usability over gas.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD, stick shift, tail lights, roof rack, comfortable seats, red gauge lights, stereo is pretty good (better with CD's than radio), clutch is very smooth, back seats have good room, lots of storage space, window frames cut out exterior sound, overall a very solid and well built ride from what I see.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked up a used 08 WRXwagon. Had 8000 miles on it. Runs great, fun, decent gas mileage for the zip and pep ones gets. Maybe it's me but having situations with dvd and radio sound. Radio static or crackling, sound in and out or totally gone. DVD sound, music plays but people speaking sounds cave like. Subwoofer ok, but sound system itself is weak compared to my Hummer I traded. CDs play great so must be antenna trouble? Worth buying used, love the WRX!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently traded in a 2001 BMW 325i for a 2008 Impreza WRX 5-door. Although I loved my BMW, I was not able to afford all the features I really wanted. After searching, I chose the Subaru for its blend of power, handling, and usability. I also look forward to only having one set of wheels/tires that will work year around so I do not have to mess with swapping winter and three-season wheels every year. I think this car was a good choise and I think it will work out well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've driven moderately sporty cars for a few years (Legacy GT Ltd, MG-ZTT), but this new Impreza leaves them all standing. Very fast (but not *crazy* fast), surprisingly refined (even over eye-watering Ohio roads) and - get this - I'm leasing it for less than $250/month....unbelievable. I can't tell you how good I feel about this car, and how little it's costing me. If you're after speed and good looks - without busting your wallet - you would be insane to get anything else.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far, this car is terrific. We had tons of snow in Vermont this winter, and I was able to drive anywhere with the standard all-weather tires. While the drive doesn't quite have the feel of a European car, the 5 speed is fun enough and the price tag for an AWD vehicle is just right. Love the hatch for bike/skis/dog etc., and the premium package with the VDC, leather stuff and 6 disc changer is totally worth the money. MPG is better than expected. I do mostly highway driving, and after 10,000 miles I'm starting to average around 29 MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Previously owned an 05 STI. This 08 is worlds above the old STI. It's more comfortable and waay more quiet. The power delivery is more linear, which makes it seem like it's not faster than previous version but speedometer says otherwise :-) The suspension offers no shock to the kidneys over bumps while retaining the ability to take corners at much higher speeds than the old versions. I love that the car looks more aggressive but does not grab the attention like the old versions with the big wing. Sleeper look.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The wide body look, fender flares look awesome. Hatchback utility. Smooth suspension. Interior materials are Major upgrades over previous STIs. 20 MPG avg. is pretty good for a 300HP, AWD car. Sound of boxer engine and exhaust seems more aggressive and sweeter sounding than my old 05 STI.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had the car since January. Having this car made my winter commute just a bit safer and easier. Now that the weather is warmer and the motor is more broken-in, I am getting better MPG. My mix is 60-70% highway and I'm getting roughly 24-25MPG. I'm not exactly the most calm of drivers either, I don't straight cruise too often. I haven't had any problems w/ this car except for the paint which is rather thin. </TEXT>
