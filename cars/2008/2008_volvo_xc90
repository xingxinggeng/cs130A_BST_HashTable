<TEXT>Leased our 08 XC90 V8 AWD with Premium Package and Bi-Xenons in Feb '08. Best car we've ever owned! 24,000 miles on it so far and love it. No problems! Perfect size......spacious inside, 3rd Row if you need it / lots of cargo room if you don't. 2nd row slides fore and aft to adjust legroom where it's needed most. Excellent interior materials and quality. Drives like a dream. Yamaha-built 4.4L V8 is a ROCKET and has tons of passing power, but will get 22-23 mpg on the highway if you set the cruise at 60-62mph. Yes, this is AWD:) Handles rock solid in the snow if you put snow tires on it. Great car.......we're definitely buying it at the end of the lease</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Build quality, interior materials, workmanship, VERY powerful V8 motor, excellent fuel economy, very flexible interior layout, plenty of space.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've driven the XC90 for 20K+ miles still love it. Mileage is almost always over 20. Trips - Norway/Sweden 1,700 miles - 23.8 mpg. Upper Midwest 2,400 - 23.4 mpg. New England - 3,400 miles 23.7 mpg. Amazingly good mileage. Comfort can't be beat. Have had ZERO problems, not even one repair trip to the dealer. It will be a long time before I trade-in this car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seats are the most comfortable I've ever owned. Long distance driving is easy. The exterior is durable and looks as good as new.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was going to buy a Lexus RX350 but told the salesman that I had another appointment at the Volvo dealership that morning. I would most probably come back to close the deal with him after the appointment. After a test drive of Volvo XC90, I changed my mind right away. The car felt smooth, sturdy, and macho, having an excellent road grip at highway curves. I have driven the car for almost 5 months since then and never had a problem with its workmanship. Believe it or not, it is also a head turner on highway. One major complaint I have about the car is gas mileage, so far I have 14.8 m/g. Another complaint is its slow acceleration, but I have learned to live with that. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The wife and I have been driving the XC90 V8 for a little over a year now. The drive is exceptional and the power is second to none. This vehicle drives like a fine tuned sports car and grips the road like velcro. The vehicle is a real head turner going down the road and at traffic lights. Dynaudio is the best. Navigation is OK, but could be a little better with response times. I have missed a turn or two when driving. I am a bit surprised that some of the interior plastic decor parts (pieces that cover some of the metal have fallen off and the middle console is loosey goosey when you go to store something away. We are leasing and will be turning the vehicle in at the end of 2009 </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We love the body style, the leather seats and the Dynaudio. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We leased this SUV after 7 leases of Volvo cars before it. We had outgrown any car they make and this is a perfect fit. Lots of room, extra row of seats, (not much room there) and all the emenities needed. The ride is solid, plenty of room for me, (6'2'') amd a son of the same size. The premium sound is great, there is more than enough power to enter the highway safely and easily, braking is solid also. Car looks great, very reliable and lots of room in the back for luggage and whatever you pick up at Home Depot. The leather seats are as comfortable as at home, heat is great, have yet to do a summer with the black leather interior, but we are not concerned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Premium sound system with 6 CD, love the moon roof and the luxurious feel of the SUV. Feels very untrucklike. Volvo is very agressive in their pricing currently, you can get a great deal if you are patient and know how to negotiate. We got ours for 15k under sticker price, 10k under invoice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great car. Enjoy the comfort of the ride. The Sirius radio is a great addition. The SUV lacks armrests for rear passengers. Lack of the armrest is huge disappointment. Lack of armrest made our rear seat passengers uncomfortable. I cannot understand why developers did not include rear seat arm rest for passenger. The styling is great. The car is eye catching. The performance of the front wheel drive is great. Numerous safety features are available. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've now driven almost 2200 miles with my XC90 3.2. No mechanical or other problems. The ride is a bit stiff but that does help the handling. Overall, it is an easy to handle car, but one does notice it is big and heavy. The AWD keeps it on the road all the time and it doesn't flip/ flop turning corners as much as other SUV's. But it does a bit the tendency to go straight when turning corners, probably based on it being a primairily FWD based car. The 3.2 is a nice engine, with enough power to handle the car and a full load of passengers and luggage. I can imagine with the weight of the car that the V8 would be a lot nicer to drive, although the mileage will be even worse. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We like all the safety and luxury options, BLIS, rear seat entertainment etc.I also considered the X5 (pretty, but 5 seats and much more expensive) and the Highlander hybrid (really ugly looking) but , the invoice price of the XC90 was average $10,000 less than a Highlander or BMW. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd XC90. Came out of a great experience in a 2005 XC90 and couldn't find anything I really wanted better. Tested a Mazda CX9, Mercedes M Class, Subaru Tribeca, Highlander, Lexus RX 350...and on and on. It may not have the fun "zoom-zoom quality of the Mazda, but the Mazda outside mirrors vibrate like crazy...rear seats vibrated...tracks in the floor looked so cheap. Mercedes was nice but didn't like the paddle shifter and it's too small cargo area. Volvo makes the most beautiful, classy looking SUV. Nothing beats the feeling of quality in my XC 90. This new engine drives great. I thought I'd miss the Turbo. Not at all. Great lease deals make it the perfect family vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Wood steering wheel, exterior styling, beautiful leather comfy seats, outside mirrors that fold in with a push of a button, solid as a tank safety. steering feels great. Third row seats without a minivan feel to the interior</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought the XC90 after owning a Suburban to get a smaller vehicle, a "luxury" SUV, and for the safety features. The safety features are there, but this SUV is not a sturdy vehicle for active families. The middle console has come out, the doors do not automatically lock/unlock, it rattles, the seats in the back rows are difficult to lay down-just to name a few of our complaints. For the money, we regret we did not purchase the Lexus or the Land Cruiser. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The CX90 is in a class by itself. I drove the 08 MDX (I've owned two), but the V-6 labors, it's still only a five speed, the ride is harsh, and the wind and road noise are too high. The BMW X-3 is a teetering joke, the X-5 3.0 is underpowered, the 4.4 overpriced, besides which the controls are needlessly quirky, the navigation screen miniscule, and the 'leather' looks and feels like 2nd rate plastic. How do they sell those things? The Volvo leather on my premium is sumptuous, the materials and design are great, and the ride responsive but quiet with no wind noise. In short, It's a great ride. And the lease was the same as the the MDX for a car that stickers for 10k more. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, power, quiet, quality of materials, style and safety, blind spot warning, 6 speed tranny and the great muted growl of that Yamaha 4.4 liter. My '58 P544 had three points belts. Detroit caught up 30 years later, kicking and screaming. Volvo designs safety in. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I leased this vehicle and I'm glad I leased it and not purchsed! Looking forward to giving it back! The seats are uncomfortable, at least the driver seat is. Blind spots, visiblity isn't the greatest! I owned a Ford Explorer prior to this lease and I plan to go back to the Explorer once this lease is up! I also experience a delay when turning a corner and steping on the gas. It takes a second or two before you actually accelerate! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this XC90 after 4 years in a Caddy SRX. Looked at and drove an MDX, ML350, Highlander, Enclave and a BMW X- 5. All nice, well built autos, but when you sit in the XC90, shut the door and drive you feel safe and comfortable. Controls are well layed out and everything is easy to use. No useless extras in the dash to "play" with. It has a solid feel on the road, either 4 lane interstate or two lane back roads. Recently took an 800 mile round trip and averaged 22 mpg. Not bad for going 75 to 80 mph. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We leased our 2nd XC 90 in August 2008, and couldn't be happier. Our first lease was a 2006 XC 90 with the 5 cyl. turbo, and it was a mediocre performer. Way underpowered, it worked so hard all the time it got horrible gas mileage and forget trying to get it to do a 50 to 70 pass on the highway. It had some warrenty work, but none of the horror stories I have read elsewhere. Based on the improved reliability cited by consumer's reports, we decided to lease a new V8. It is light years better - it feels like a completely different car, and the gas mileage is about the same between the two. There are only minor differences between the model yrs, and the incentives made them the same price!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got this car mostly because I needed a change from my previous black MDX and black RX300. I got the passion red V8 Sport because it looked terrific and drove nicely on the test drive. I love this car because 2 months after I got it I was in a collision (head on with air bag deployment) with my two toddlers and elderly parents on the way to my daughter's birthday party and we all walked away with a few minor bruises. The tow truck driver and police officers all said to me "thank God you were in a Volvo." The dealer made my car perfect again and I love it more than ever.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My fourth Volvo, but SUV. A 2008 V8 Special Edition with practically all options. Paid $56,000 and have no regrets. The ride is smooth, steering responsive and road grip and stability far better than my wife's Acura MDX. Second row a bit cramped, but as it is meant for kids and they are more interested in the entertainment system, it's not a big issue. Air condition for the rear seats is on all the time, as it enhances the over-all airflow. The air quality system and BLIS makes highway traffic very comfortable. I drive the car pretty hard and has a mileage below 12, but the V8 sound is so great that it's hard not to use the power. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife has always wanted the XC90, so we took the plunge when the lease on our Pathfinder was up. It's a beautiful car, and we've owned Volvos all along growing up. From a comfort standpoint, the car is top notch. More interior room than the Pathfinder. Powerful stereo system. It was good to get the familiar Volvo safety I've been used to over the years. Only problem, the gas mileage is horrible. We're aveaging 14.8. But hey, what do you expect for a car that is "dripping" in safety features, that's more important Also, had to drop some paperwork at the dealership one day and something punctured my tire as I was driving out, they reimbursed me for the new tire!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Super soft leather, very supportive seats. Rock solid body & safety features. And, for an SUV of its size, it corners pretty well! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was fooled into buying the XC-90 after the arrival of our first child. Truth is, this has been the worst car we've ever purchased. It drives, but constantly in the shop for several issues, including AC problems, allignment issues, electronics, mechanical, and at one point, they had to replace both front axles completely! Don't be fooled by the safety recommendations, all newer luxury SUV's have good overall safety ratings. Further, the car has horrible traction control in rainy conditions. If you do decide to purchase, please buy the AWD. I do not let my wife and child drive this car when it rains.</TEXT>

Needed new tires after only 20K miles ??? no warranty ?? I will say the dealer was very good about everything, even though it took them 4 tries to fix one of the main problems. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My new XC-90 V-8 is a terrific vehicle. The ride is smooth & comfortable. Power from the V-8 makes driving fun. Volvo has the most comfortable seats in the business. Gas mileage has been decent at an average of 17.5-18.5 mpg in mixed local driving. This is better than my previous Ford Explorer V-8 (16.5-17.5) & my friend's 6 cyl XC-90. The steering is a bit lighter than I would like, but handling is crisp. The new blind spot warning system is very helpful on the highway. All in all, a great vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We came out of a BMW X5 4.4 and couldn't be happier. Performance is the same, ride is sporty but not as stiff; we pretty much got this thing loaded and got a free Garmin Nav unit as well. Ended up with the V8 because we didn't feel the 6 cyl could do the job. Fuel economy in 600 miles of in- town driving around 16.5 mpg; pretty good for a heavy car. The biggest thing for us was keeping the same size SUV and getting more interior room and with the 3rd seat down, there is plenty for her and the baby's stuff. We got ours at the end of the month and after negotiating, they practically gave this thing away. Get the Executive pack with different leather and the blindspot info deal; worth it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Took delivery of this vehicle in Korea using the diplomat and military sales program. Very simple process to custom order the vehicle from the factory and saved nearly $9K over state-side MSRP. Zero mechanical or quality issues since it arrived 8 months ago. Incredibly versatile SUV for my family of five- we've used a variety of seating configurations for different trips, extra guests etc. Very quiet at standstill and on highways and a nice sound to the inline 6 when you step on it. I had driven the V8 version several times before and it is more fun, but I couldn't justify the extra cost and I've never felt I absolutely needed the extra power. One of the best family vehicles out there.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very, very family friendly with integrated booster seat and 3rd row, multiple seating configs, myriad saftey features, etc. Very powerful brakes considering size and wieght of SUV. Love the active bi-xenon headlamps. Very classy looks- prefer the clean lines of this SUV over most of its competitors</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Decided on Volvo for safety and built- in booster seat for toddler, luxury items, good 2 yr lease deal. Considered Mercedes M class for same money, but ride and comfort were the worst of any SUV I've driven. Very surprised. I even test drove the M-B three times, but to no avail. Acura MDX was more luxurious and had better bells/whistles, reliability, but lease deals were poor. Only stripped down MDX was offered as a deal, but adding options was costly! BMW X5 - too small and clunky doors- wife hated it! Man's car. Lexus RX was wonderful, but too small for our needs. Volvo has best safety record, but scary reliability. I got a 2 year lease since didn't want to live with a mistake for 3 years. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Built-in booster:convenience of having adult in 2nd row along with toddler & infant without juggling car seats. Nice interior - wood steering, BLIS, park assist, comfy front seats, push-button child safety locks, locking windows that lock rear windows only. Nice to be able to open windows up front.</FAVORITE>

Maintenance plan is not worth the money if dealership can't fix my Volvo. My parking assist has not worked right yet! It comes up after I am finish parking. Plus side bar on SUV are too high for ladies. I thought I wanted this Volvo, but now I would gave it away for a good BMW. Other bad things with this car is too tight up front, very uncomfortable. After paying 50k for it, gas is about high as the car! This car is not worth the money. I wish I had BMW! Don't believe Volvo. </TEXT>

<TEXT>People, you're talking a Volvo not a Honda, you will live through a horrific crash, you will have 311hp, this vehicle is safe, and because of that it weighs as much as much larger SUV's so the 13-18 mpg isn't that bad. Stop crying about fuel economy, put your family in a Prius if that's important to you, if you want a truly safe, well built, nice looking SUV this is the truck for you! Remember you get what you pay for, there's a reason that this truck is over $50,000 without things like navigation and rear view cameras, because you are paying for safety! This is another of those "imports" that you can buy and still buy American, Volvo is a proud member of the Ford Motor Company!</TEXT>

It is now back in my garage. How do you feel when you shelled out 40k for a SUV that breaks this early in your ownership? I now keep my fingers crossed. Read your state's Lemon Law. I did.

We are averaging 17 miles per gallon and this is FWD ! We did get a "good" deal based on the over $40K sticker price and final price of $36,250 with dealer cash and X plan discount. This is our first Volvo and may be our last. Traded our Infiniti and have had second thoughts many times. </TEXT>

My rating is slightly lower on performance and fun to drive just based on the fact I have a hard time not comparing it to the M3 - totally different vehicles, but I'm still having a little separation anxiety. I do love this SUV. I did my research and really found this to be the best bang for the buck and it is. I have been a german car owner and vowed to never buy anything else... well Volvo won me over!

<TEXT>We picked up the car at the Volvo delivery center in Goteberg, Sweden and drove to Oslo, Lillehammer, over the mountains to Balestrand, back through Sweden, Karlstad, Stockholm, Kalmar. Climbing the mountains was no effort for the V8 and was unaffected by the altitude. We drove 1700 miles in ten days. The only challenge was parking in an Oslo underground garage meant for the dimunitive European vehicles. Mileage for trip was 23.8 mpg which is excellent considering the mountain and in city driving. But minimum octane in Norway/Sweden was 95. I've been a Honda/Acura owner for 30 years. Owned an MDX and test drove a new MDX recently. The Volvo XC90 is the ultimate. </TEXT>
