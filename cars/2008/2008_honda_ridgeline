<TEXT>I drive 200 miles round trip a day mostly highway on cruise. My mileage was low until I put about 15,000 on the truck but now regularly get 22MPG cruising at 70 with my high being 23.9. I have found that the power is quite good but the VSA system intrudes too much leaving most folks with the impression it doesn't have low end power. If you switch the button off the truck will launch hard indicating Honda should rethink the programming. My biggest beefs are lack of a telescoping wheel that allows one to rest your elbows on the door and console pad without feeling like you're reaching. Seat comfort is misleading; way too hard. I will be the first in line for a new dturbo diesel.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great AWD truck. Styling is great. Friendly driver controls. Good power considering the weight. Problems included the tailgate lever which was replaced. Makes this start up noise- "normal" per dealership. Huh??? Showed me a youtube excerpt about. Supposedly won't cause any problems, uhuh...Storage is great especially the hidden bed trunk. Poor gas mileage 15- 17mpg city 18mpg combined and that's pushing it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this truck, new, well over a year ago, and I've never regretted it once. In fact, quite the contrary. If you have a family, a house, or do any light duty stuff (for ex. trips to the dump), this is a GREAT vehicle. I live in New England and it's solid in the snow as well. I also take long trips (500+ miles) with my family of 4. The Ridgeline is all about comfort and stows a TON of gear. The trunk in the bed can't be beat (even "big truck" guys agree). My wife likes driving it, which is something a few guys have asked me (hey, it stinks, but once in a while I have to give up my truck); the visibility and comfort are great for me at 6'1" and my wife at 5'2". Awesome all-around vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Ridgeline. I originally owned a 2006 RTS which I drove for almost 60,000 miles. I was going to buy the new 2009 body, but with the great deals they offered on the 2008 I opted to get it instead. I was able to get the loaded out leather, Navi, Moonroof RTL for what I originally paid for the 06 RTS. I was very pleased with the reliability and overall performance of the 06, which is why I decided to buy another one. In 60,00 miles the only thing I had fixed was a strut which was under warranty at the time. I drive a lot for a living so comfort is extremely important. I have owned a few trucks over the years and have never had one that drives as well as the Ridgeline. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had nothing but issues with this truck, the first problem showed up the day after I bought it. I have owned my truck for about a year and a half and have had numerous seals replaced included a gas cap. Most recently my brakes. They have frozen up on me and the emergency brake stays on. Neither the dealership or Honda know how to fix, they know there is a problem but have told me they can only fix it once I am stranded again. Not looking forward to that. I would never recommend this truck or Honda again, I had better luck with Hyundai.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned my ridgeline for 9 months now. Test drove the Tundra but wasn't about to drop $32k on something that didn't have all the options I wanted. The RTS model had everything I wanted and needed. Wife loves driving it and handles great in the Seattle area snow and year round rain!! Traded in my '05 Civic for this and couldn't be happier.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, this is the best car/truck I have owned and driven for a person who has owned and driven 50 plus cars. It is practical in regard to doing a variety of things really well. It is very solid and safe with 5 star ratings. It tows well with an excellent tranny match. It has good off road ability in the sense that if you are not looking to get stuck you won't. It rides like a car. My only real complaint is that it is short on after market options.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased my RTX after coming out of a Honda Odyssey lease. I really enjoy the overall driving experience of this truck. It handles extremely well, drives smoothly and is comfortable inside. I love the in-bed trunk and the numerous storage areas inside the cab. The gas mileage is comparable to other mid-size 4x4 trucks, so I knew what I was getting into. The engine is powerful, but seems to strain just a little when trying to pass with a cab full of people or a load being towed. Love the way the back seats fold up so you can use the flat floor for storage. Don't pass up the Ridgeline because of looks, you will regret not test driving this vehicle when comparing the others trucks out there.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>In-bed trunk, all four windows can go down using the key remote, lots of storage, fold up back seats, tailgate that swings out and folds down and sliding rear window. Full front/side airbags. Safety features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This was my first time ever buying (leasing) a import vehicle and so far I have not been that impressed. The Performance is good and it is fun to drive. Driving it in the snow is like a dream. It also tows my medium sized tent trailer very well but that is where the good stuff ends. I find the front seats are not comfortable on long drives and my back ends up very sore. My truck has been to two different dealerships a total of 7 times for tailgate issues and the problem is still not fixed correctly. After a year, the driver door seal wore out and had to be replaced. The paint is very soft and scratches very easily so I do not recommend a dark color (mine is a dark red).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The in bed trunk is very cool. My family and I (4) were able to store 4 bags in it for a week long road trip. If you really need space you can store the spare in the bed and get even more room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had this one year and nearly 15000 miles. This has been all I had expected and more. It drives more like a car than a truck, and yet is incredibly spacious and has lots of novel features. It is wide enough to put a mountain bike inside the back (putting the seats up) without having to take off the front wheel. You can comfortably sit 3 across the back, or fit a 4x8 sheet of plywood in the bed. A lot has been written about this truck, so I really will only add that I am more impressed with this truck after owning it for a year than I was when I first bought it! The only negative I can think of is the gas mileage is mediocre. I average 17, but have gotten as high as 22 on the highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall experience has been great. I use my truck as my daily driver throughout Minnesota winters and most of the summer. Handling and ride are excellent for a truck, my previous truck was a GMC Sierra and the Honda is better in pretty much every respect other than raw power and towing capacity. Interior design is highly functional but a little drab and goofy in some respects such as the cartoon large interior door pulls. I have towed a race car on a open trailer (near 5000 lbs. total) hundred of miles with no problems and the truck has plenty of pulling power and stability as a tow vehicle. The bed is pure genius not only for the truck but also for the full 48" width.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had our truck for about 6 mo and it is great. It is amazing on the snow. My wife is from the south and hates driving our Lexus in the snow but does great with this truck. It handles and rides better than any other truck I test drove (Tundra, Tacoma, F150, Frontier etc.) and it gets reasonable mileage for a truck. It has good acceleration and the inbed storage trunk is a stroke of genius. We are very happy with our truck and would highly recc it to others.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my Ford truck and my Dodge Durango thinking I could get the best of both worlds with the Ridgeline. During the first 1K miles, so far so good with the exception of mileage. The Ridgeline handles great, the AWD grips fine in inclement weather and the interior is comfortable. The storage spaces are very well designed from the sunglass holder to the pull forward center console that reveals additional CD storage to under seat storage in the rear. In terms of complaints, the navi system is not worth the extra money. My $200 Garmin is easier to use, gives more detailed directions and displays the speed limits which is great on unfamiliar roads. Save the $2K and skip it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Ridgeline, but 2 months ago I noticed something with wheels feeling like right front tire was flat. Next week had to have vehicle towed, because it wouldn't accelerate. Make a long story short took to Honda 3 times they wouldn't take wheels off would only do road tests. I had to take truck to dealer every night so when it happened again it would be there. They would not check it out unless they actually saw what truck was doing. It ended up being the rear differential that was locking. It only happens in 30 degree or less weather. I live in Charlotte, NC it usually doesn't get cold here, but it has. So if you experience this locking of wheels you now know what it is.Thanks warranty</TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at the Tacoma, the Frontier, and the Ridgeline. Granted, people told me the Ridgeline wasn't a "true" truck, well that's all right with me! Drives like my Accord V6 - but with loads of space to haul or tow things. Super comfortable, super styling, and Honda reliability - how can you go wrong??</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the storage features - inside and out! Plus, to be able to take my family (two kids under 3), and stow strollers and diaper bags - without even having to leave exposed in the truck bed - awesome!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have 14K on my Ridgeline RTX. Thus far the swing out tailgate latch and the rear seat vent have broken. Otherwise OK. I have towed boats and trailers with no problems. Brakes work well while towing but fuel mileage drops to 10 MPG or less. Shifts a lot even without a trailer - very annoying. I think the engine could handle it if the tranny would wait to drop out of high gear. I noticed torque steer when passing, it surprised me and made me swerve. Trunk is awesome. Drives and parks like a car. Fuel mileage is only so-so. Averaging 17-18 and 19-20 on hwy. Functionally the truck is great. It's kind of ugly and my buddies make lots of fun but it's really practical and does what I need it to do.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a former owner of Dodge, Ford, Nissan, and Toyota Trucks. Friends and family tried to steer me towards purchasing a new (08 or 09) Chevy/GM Truck with their current low prices. I drove and tried to make a deal on both GM products along with a new F-150, but the sales folks couldn't quite get me to where I wanted to be. The first time I test drove a Ridgeline, I knew this was the vehicle for me. I don't require the services of a full size truck, so the Honda is the perfect fit for me. I recently took my truck on a road trip consisting of 2,000 miles through rain, sleet and snow over mountains, and through major metro areas. It handled great in the snow! Averaged 19 MPG/Hwy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow! So much to say, so little space. I have been looking and researching this segment for nearly five years. I really wanted a Tacoma, but even with the low car sales plaguing the industry, Toyota didn't want to play. Honda immediately offered me an incredible deal on this 08 RTS that I didn't need any more incentive- I snatched it up. This is an incredibly smart truck- all space is usable; seats are comfortable, even in the back where I was concerned most because this often overlooked space is easiest to get cheapest attention (Chevy Colorado). Absolutely the smartest design in this category (if you're looking for heavy hauling, look to full size trucks); fits me like a glove. LUV IT!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Pure genius in their design. Every nook and cranny wisely used; more comfortable than any other truck in this class; I can see just fine out all windows; only tuck in this class with a three headrests in the back; three fit comfortably in the back- try that with some of the others (Dodge excluded)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I downsized from a Suburban. I really liked the Chevy (it was nearly flawless), but I got hosed on the resale value. The Honda rides well and seems to be reasonable with regard to fuel economy. I do think Honda could improve a few things. The HomeLink buttons are not lighted & can be tough to find at night. Fog-lights should certainly be standard on the RTL. The front passenger seat is heated, but only the bottom cushion "due to the side-impact airbags"?? Attention Honda: Other manufacturers have figured that out. Give them a call. Also, the stereo is good, but not the equal of that in the top-of-the line Pilot. Honda: truckers like to rock on too. All in all a good vehicle for the $!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked at GMC & Ford but went with R'line for Honda quality. With 8000 on the odo, wife was run off the road and into a tree by teenaged driver. Bags didn't deploy, and no one was hurt but $15,000 in front end (including frame) damages later, local dealer's body shop did a superb job getting R'line back on the road. Will have to drive it into the ground now, since it has little trade-in value but seems to be back at 100% Have had to replace navi and a heated seat control both under warranty, unusual reliability for a Honda. Very comfortable front seats in which to drive, especially on highway trips. Rear seat not comfortable for my teenagers and fuel economy no better than a GMC 1500.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After looking at vehicles for two years, I made the decision to buy a Ridgeline over a Toyota Tacoma. I have been delighted with all aspects of the truck with the exception of the mileage. Although it is not horrible, I would really like to see 25 mpg on the highway. The design features are well thought out and everything is easy to use. Ride comfort is outstanding, although cabin noise could be less. I went to a different tire and noise dropped, but body insulation improvement needs to be worked on by Honda engineers. I take long trips and also used the truck on a rugged ranch and have no complaints. Online forums often mention the easily scratched bedliner, and this is a problem. </TEXT>

Well after test driving and comparing prices for what I was looking for in a truck the truck I thought was unattractive was what I bought. I love it and it looks good. I traded a Mercedes Benz ML SUV for my Ridgeline, to pull my Harley. I've gotten so many compliments on my brand new 2008 White Honda Ridgeline. Go Honda.

<TEXT>My Wife and I bought this because our 2003 Sonoma extended cab proved too small for our needs. After looking at a number of offerings, and both of us DRIVING them, the Ridgeline stood out as the best handling, and it had a trunk! Add the stylish and very comfortable interior, two way tailgate, AWD,and HONDA reliability, it was a no brainer. After 15,000 miles, 3 synthetic oil changes and a K&N filter...19.4 in town, 25.5 highway (spirited driving). Prior to these changes, we got 15.2 in mixed driving. You will use the trunk more than you think. Go give it a look, a drive and with end of year pricing a great deal too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this truck(sort of) in May. I have 10K miles. This truck is easy to drive with great brakes and a nice suspension. It tows my bass boat and 14' trailer with no problems except for frequent shifting. One annoying thing is that the truck routinely shifts out of top gear on the highway even without a trailer. Engine could use more low end to reduce shifts. Great upper end power. Seats seem to stain easily. Interior storage is nice. Have noticed some torque steer trying to pass. This truck is really handy and practical. Other vehicle is a 2005 F150. Ridgeline is easier to drive and park. Only reason for F150 is hauling horses. Overall it is a great truck that can handle almost everything.</TEXT>

I have had a few issues with it, the rear tailgate is broke and will not swing out (handle seems broken, will get that taken care next oil change), had part of the ceiling fall down (was repaired). The navigation system works well and has a large screen but the more i use it i wish it had more features. Have not driven it in snow yet so have yet to test the all wheel drive system.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded a Chevy 2500HD LT 4WD Duramax Crew Cab because of fuel prices ($4.50 a gal). I was surprised form the word go. Lots of room, plenty of power, a trunk, AWD (4WD?) and its a Honda. Gas mileage is average, 17 around town. Only one problem so far and it was taken care of at the first oil change ("swing" function on tailgate wouldn't work, "lift" function worked fine). Tows the boat with no problem getting in or out of the ramps (18 ft 3500lbs boat and trailer). The AWD works great, go to 4 LOW if you actually need to, with a button on the dash. Just go drive one... </TEXT>

<TEXT>So my 1999 Chevy Blazer goes down with a broken crankshaft, which is funny cause I just about replaced everything else on it. Well I really can't complain 200,000 miles later. So a friend turns me on to the Ridgeline. Since the first test drive I still wonder why people buy Chevy and Ford. The Ridgeline offers a comfortable smooth car-like ride while keeping the power and durability of a truck. A wider wheelbase and higher elevation makes driving easier with better sight of the road and amazing handling. No blind spots and sweet take off power. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Found the Ridgeline does not stand out out in any one area, however it does do everything very well. Performance is Ok if you get on it hard enough; there is just a ton of storage room (more than it looks; 15 in the city and 19 on the highway and it seems to be getting better. I have 4000 miles on it now and no problems. Some rattles and squeaks from the front dash corners by the windscreen where the speakers are which will be repaired at its first service. I am liking my ridgeline more and more as I drive it. Under the back seat fits my golf bag with the seats down:)I would recommend this vehicle to anyone with realistic expectations</TEXT>

<TEXT>When replacing a Ford Ranger I looked into the Colorado, Dakota and Tacoma. Thought the Ridgeline was out of my price range. After not getting what I wanted in the above three, I went to the Honda dealership. Boy am I glad I did. The purchase price (cash, no trade- in) was a grand less than the Tacoma. I've had it for 8 months now and am completely satisfied. It's still fun to drive. I take it to out-of town ASA tourneys all the time. It has plenty of interior room for the passengers and plenty of storage for the softball equipment. The ride is amazing. It's smoother than the wifes Accord. I'd recommend the Ridgeline to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We had always owned a Chev or GMC before in Northern BC Canada,it can be tough driving in the winter so we were concerned about moving away from the large size vehicle. However after our first 3 or 4 months we have nothing but good things to say about the vehicle and the service from Honda. Our other vehicle had always been a Toyota so it was nice to see good service at Honda as well. GMC and Especially Ford could learn a lot on how to service customers. Lastly if I was asked what weakness this truck had I would say that a more efficient diesel option would have been great. Driving Duramax diesels before exposed us to the benefits of that type of engine. Its been our best vehicle buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm an IT Consultant and lug around a lot of technical tools. It's nice to be able to store them in the lockable, waterproof trunk. This frees up the cab for the dog and friends. Adequate power from the V6 and I really like its look. Black with standard gray interior. I also like the fact that it comes with a XM radio enabled stereo ready to activate. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a 2002 Silverado which I really liked. The Ridgeline fit my needs better and has proven to be an awesome vehicle for the family. It drives superb, handles better on icy/snowy roads than any vehicle I've ever driven, and is comfortable. It tows fine, and has handled light off-road travel well. Gas mileage has been exactly as advertised and better. I routinely get 16-17 in town in the winter and 17-19 in the summer. Highway mileage has been better than expected, almost always between 21-23 mpg. Fully loaded with 4 people and 500-600 lbs of camping gear, the truck averaged 22 mpg @ 65-70 mph in varied terrain. It's a little ugly, but I'd buy another today. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a truck guy, and I was dead set on buying a tundra or f-150 until gas crept up to $4/gallon. So I went to the Toyota dealership set on buying a Tacoma. But the dealership was rude and was not interested in negotiating. That was the best thing that ever happened because the ridge blows the taco away. It's everything I need in a truck plus more. It has the comfort and features of a nice SUV which is great for 90% percent of the driving I do, and the utility of a truck for the 10% of the time when I need it. Definite buy, I got it at the dealer's cost -4500 Honda incentive. (almost 10k off sticker price)</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought my 2008 RTS in April 2008 and got $4,500 cash rebate. Out the door I paid about $6k below sticker price -- nice! The truck is my second vehicle (1st is a BMW M3), and I use it pretty much only for carrying a quad to Rocky Point, Mexico, or out to the desert here in Phoenix. The Ridgeline is perfect for these trips....the ride is amazingly smooth (better than my BMW) and the truck tows and hauls pretty effortlessly. Mileage varies from about 15-20mpg, but again this is always with a 400lb TRX450 quad in the back which is both heavy and not aerodynamic, so I am not complaining. Plus, did you know gas is only $2.15/gal. in Mexico??</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The best feature of this truck is its non-truck-like ride. It's basically a tall Honda Accord behind the wheel. 4-wheel drive is awesome and has not left me stranded yet. The power is fair and the interior is not Mercedes level, but perfectly fine for what this vehicle does.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Ridgeline is turning out to be a near perfect vehicle for me. I'm a salesman, driving about 50K yearly, so my vehicle needs to be comfortable as well as practical. The Ridgeline's innovative trunk swallows up a couple of big plastic tubs full of catalogs, plus I can still get a garment bag flat on top of the tubs and get the lid closed, so that works great! Plus, my golf clubs fit perfectly under the back seat. So, for a full week of travel, everything I need either goes in the trunk or under the back seat other than my briefcase with laptop, which I don't trust to anything other than the back seat.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>After a long, hard winter with much more snow than usual, the VTM4 AWD system did a great job. Never once did I feel any loss of traction, even on very icy roads, and that's with the stock Michelin LTX M/S tires. Dedicated snow tires would be even better.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Drives like a car and has many useful functions like trailering, hauling,and the built in ice chest. I have no issues with the driving view at all. I'm 6 feet tall. The seats adjust back and forth and up and down. There's plenty of storage and it is going to be GREAT for a newborn. It has been on the sandy beaches in Florida with no problems. It laughs at soft sand. The VTM4 works great. I had not notice any issue trailing a 18 ft Sea Ray Bowrider. This is the perfect "truck" for the urbanites. People should not be comparing the mpg versus the former Honda cars (Accord). Comparing apples to oranges. For a TRUCK, it gets above average mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just getting through the first couple of tanks of gas. The mileage is very respectable in comparison to other trucks in the same category. This is a domesticated truck with a lot of refinement that a work truck would not necessarily have. If you have an occasional need for a truck then this is your vehicle. If you are in need of heavy towing and off road capabilities this will probable not fill your needs. But be serious about how deep into the wilderness you go and you will probable come to the conclusion this truck will meet your needs 95% of the time. A great time to buy with incentives, fear of gas prices and oversupply that probable will not exist next year.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased my 2008 Ridgeline RTX and even though I am not a truck/SUV guy, I truly love this vehicle! It has a great ride and handles beautifully. Part of my commute is through steep mountain passes, and this 4500 lb. truck handles like a 4 door sedan. It is a remarkable trait for a vehicle of this size and weight to be so nimble. There are lots of creative features that make this truck really unique, including the flip-up rear seats, lockable bed trunk, and useful center console and sliding armrest. I just filled up today and averaged 20 MPG including a steep commute but little city driving. I ordered a tonneau cover to hopefully increase MPG. Overall, a very satisfying purchase!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned my 2008 Ridgeline for about 3 months now and appreciate it more than ever. It is a great vehicle for the family--lots of room for people and cargo. The storage is substantial. The swing out tail gate makes it much easier to reach the load in the bed. Rear seating is more comfortable than the competition. The MSRP is expensive, but the discounts make it affordable. Fuel economy is normal for a 4X4 truck. I am consistently getting 17 mpg in daily city driving. Very nice vehicle for a combination of uses.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recommend the Honda Ridgeline to anyone looking for a nice 'Truck'. It rides and handles like car, but it is a truck. Great in the snow! The gas mileage will remind you that it is still a truck, but it is better than most trucks out there! I am getting about 18-20 mpg, compared to 11-12 on the Durango that I previously owned. I don't have as much power, but I don't need all of that anyway, especially with $4/gallon gas! I am very happy with my purchase, and I anticipate that Honda may change the styling a bit by the time my 36 month lease ends. I definitely plan to purchase another one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the dual action tailgate, swing open, or swing down. For a truck, it rides extremely well. The fold up seats in the rear are nice options. I love the trunk space in the bed...nice option!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this truck after wrecking my RX8. My wife said I needed something safer. I was pleased with the ride quality and build quality of the Ridge. This vehicle is very versatile and handles great in poor weather conditions. Actually when it iced and snowed here (doesn't snow much in Texas), the truck handled like it was on regular pavement. Also handles great in a pasture and some moderate muddy conditions. Just a good versatile overall vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my first time to drive a Ridgeline. A very nice truck and easy to get in and out of and my wife who is 5'1" tall had no difficulty stepping up and out of the truck. She said no running boards required for this truck. The truck is very quite and the engine is smooth. Didn't quite have the get up and go as my 2005 Honda Accord which has a 4 cylinder but still adequate power. The fuel economy is rated 15 mph for city and 20 mph for highway. The salesman said the one that he had he averaged about 24 mph highway. Whether that is true or not I don't know. The cornering ability was impressive. Overall I think it's a very nice truck and I might just buy one if the price is right.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seats are comfortable, the composite bed and locking storage is a very nice feature. I need the lumbar support and really like the electronic seat adjustments. The tailgate that opens 2 ways, that is nice. The electric rear window that slides open is a nice feature as well. Storage is good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Recently purchased a 2008 Ridgeline and love it. We actually were looking at replacing our 2005 CR-V with a new one, but discovered we could get the Ridgeline at a much cheaper lease rate. After considering the gas mileage, we went for it and don't regret it. This truck is fantastic, great ride, excellent interior design and the trunk below the box is wonderful. We have used it to haul items from Lowe's and bring other things to the dump and forgot how nice it was to have a truck. If you are not commuting long distances to work and want a nice work truck with style, this is for you.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My husband and I always said, "If Honda would just make a truck." Up until now, we had another make and no reason to get a new one. However, with the great deals around, we just had to trade in the 3 year old Tacoma. We use our truck basically to take trash to the dump and, occasionally, to get building supplies. We were pleased with the comfort and great ride in the Base RT model, and, since it's not our regular car, decided to get it. I LOVE THIS TRUCK...best we have ever owned. As a Honda/Acura loyal family, we finally got the truck we wanted, too!</TEXT>

<TEXT>You have to drive this truck to truly appreciate it. It's economical for a truck with all wheel drive yet feels more sturdy and rugged than other crew cabs such as the Colorado and Frontier. The leather seats are very comfortable with adjustable lumbar. Sticker was 36,002, invoice was 32,401 and I got mine for 28,285. That did not even count the 7,000 trade in I got. I'm moving to Oregon next month so we'll see how it does in the snow. They are great trucks and now at unbeatable prices. </TEXT>

Every try to turn a Taco around on a regular street? Can you say 3 pointer!! The Taco was a great truck, reliable, rock solid, but it no creature comforts standard. Manual seats, absolutely no storage in the cab, cramped rear seats, a crappy ride and over all cramped feeling, wimpy A/C and expensive to maintain. The Taco also got 17 MPG, uphill, downhill, city and hi-way! The Ridgeline beats the Taco in all areas, hand down. Plus it's cheaper from the get-go. Honda got it right!

<TEXT>I have always been a truck owner and have never been a fan of foreign made trucks. With gas prices on the rise and every year fewer and fewer trips to Home Depot for home and yard repair, I started looking at something more economic. I did all of my homework because I needed a crew cab for my family. I went with the Honda because it offered more for my money. It was about 5000 cheaper than the Toyota, it has a high resale value, better gas economy, cheaper insurance, and was more comfortable. I also would note that I do not haul trailers, boats, etc... for the average Joe this is a vehicle that is family friendly, rides like a car, and looks like a truck!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Due to my previous Ridgeline being totaled in an accident I had to go and buy a new vehicle. An easy choice..another Ridgeline. I upgraded to the RTL with navigation. Honda was (maybe still is) having a $3500.00 cash back on new ones. I was able to upgrade from a 2 year old RTS for only 1K more. If you haven't driven one, due yourself a favor and try it before you go and buy another GM clunker. Compare the fit & finish, quality of materials, and the drivetrain refinement. I use a Chevy Silverado for a work vehicle that has a 6 cylinder in it. No comparison! The Chevy revs high and sounds like its going to explode. Chevy also makes the cheapest looking dashboards with hard plastics. Go Honda!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned practically everything over the last few years, not being able to be satisfied. I owned trucks (Frontier, Tacoma), cars (Forester, Matrix), and have finally settled on a Ridgeline. I chose the base model and is has plenty of equipment. I am one who likes vehicles loaded. This one is not loaded, but for a truck is equipped well enough for me. The ride is the best part. It rides like a car and is extremely quiet inside. My wife loves it in the snow. We had some snow in PA and she bragged about how she was in the passing lane while 4X4 full sized trucks were fishtailing in the slow lane. I chose the base model to try it. Now that I have one, the next time, I will go up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's the perfect vehicle, it's fun, rugged, roomy, luxurious, versitle, comfy, and reliable. What more could you ask of a midsize truck? It also has a class leading payload of 1550.lbs, it can tow 5000.lbs w/500lb toung. I'm sold on the Ridgeline for life. The engine, transmission and drivetrain are as refined as they come. No vibration, shifts are silky smooth which you rarely feel. The only time I will get rid of my Ridge is when they redesign it with a V-8. A lot of people out there are really missing out on a great truck.

<TEXT>How does Ford, Chevy, Dodge, etc. still sell any trucks? I find it hard to believe. I have had them all and this Ridgeline is by far the best of the group. It can only tow about 6000 pounds, but that is not my primary use. It has been getting 21-22 hwy, 18ish mixed and 15-17 around town in pure stop-go traffic. Every time I drive it, I like it even more. The things they think of and incorporated in this vehicle are amazing. I wondered in the beginning why they made some things the way they did, and over time, everything makes perfect sense. The 4x4 system and stability control are second to none, it rides like a car and it is Honda quality. Enough said. Highly recommended</TEXT>

<TEXT>I read lots of reviews before deciding what I would buy to retire my 03 Tahoe Z71. I wanted a SUV or truck that has 4WD/AWD, that is more fuel efficient than the Tahoe and priced closer to $30K than $40K. In the end, the vehicle that fit me (6'-4")and my criteria best was the Ridgeline. Now that I've had it for a couple of weeks I am confused with the two most common complaints that I read during my pre- purchase research - gas mileage and power. To the issue of gas mileage, it compares very well with every other 6 cylinder powered vehicle out there. As to power, it is very capable in town and on the highway, but again, it's a 6. In the end, the Ridgeline is great at being what it is.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Sure this is not all truck, but if you commute that is good. It gives you some of the things a truck has while keeping all of the things to love about a car. First unlike most trucks you still get a trunk. Second the interior, because of Honda's flat floor design fits 5 people better than a Toyota Camry. Then there is the fact that you get all wheel drive. So while the big rear wheel drive trucks are sliding around in the snow the Ridgeline hugs the road. I live in a marine community and 5000lbs towing is enough for pulling boats. So no it is not totally a truck, which is great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Trunk, varriable tourque management, 20 mpg, flat floor design, dual action tailgate, extremely well done build quality, RTL interior with great dual zone heater, smooth transmission while still keeping a strong low gear in 1st.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had the Ridgeline for nearly a month now, so I feel I can give a better review at this point. Having owned several Hondas, I was excited to finally have the opportunity to drive a Honda Truck. My favorite things about the truck are its versatility and ride. I love being able to flip the seats up for extra space and being able to fit five adults if need be. I cannot stress how well this truck handles and how comfortable this truck is to drive. We've had some snow in the north east recently, and the AWD worked exceptionally well. There are a few design quirks (placement of cruise control on/off switch, cavernous space below wipers for snow to gather), this is a great vehicle overall.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride comfort, versatility, under bed lockable/weather proof storage, reliability, and overall enjoyable driving experience. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have not owned this vehicle long and I love it. The first day I drove it was during a snow storm and it handled very well. The interior is well done, steering feels tight and I now have plenty of room in the back to haul my ATV. If you are looking for a truck, but don't want to suffer with the gas mileage a full size truck gets, then this makes for a nice alternative.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dual climate control, sound system and for the most part drives as a front wheel drive car. Giant cooler in the hidden trunk.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I use my Ridgeland off road a good amount. I regularly smell burning grass after drivng down dirt roads with grass growing in the middle. I have had a serious fire in the engine compartment which caused over $5,000 of damage. I have had one other small fire which I put out with a garden hose. There is a connection around the exhaust pipe that catches grass and leaves which smolder and/or catch fire. You may remember the Honda ads during the last March Madness showing a "herd" of Ridgelines crossing a field of tall grasses. That was a brush fire in the making. This pickup is safe in the mall parking lot, but don't go near the grass. Honda has been unresponsive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Never consider myself a "truck-guy" but now I don't think I could consider driving something other than the Ridgeline type truck/SUV/car. I consider the outside looks a blend of a truck and SUV but it really drives like a car. I use the truck bed way more than I could have imagined but it still never feels like I'm driving a truck. It feels better than my wifes Lexus 470 and that's no knock on the 470. The bottom line is the inside feels like an SUV, the back is enough of a truck for what 90% of us need when hauling things and it drives like a solid car...couldn't be happier!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Truck bed, flip-down and swinging gate, trunk under truck bed and big/simple contols on dash.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking for a compact pickup to do some light towing, some low-stress off-road stuff and Home Depot for plywood or fertilizer. This RTL is the ultimate fusion of a luxury car and a utililitarian truck. The fit/finish is impeccable. The lockable bed trunk is amazing. No more cranking down the spare from underneath the bed if you have a flat. It's on a slide out tray in the bed trunk. Easier to get to than most car spares. Interior is well thought out from cup holders to flip up rear seats which yield plenty of room for 2 yellow labs in comfort. Only knock is blind spot caused by those "wings." Other than that, well, it's a Honda so you know the reliability will be there.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall Honda quality of fit and finish, locking bed trunk, fold up rear seats, composite bed liner (the best!), on demand 4-WD (idiot proof).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 6 years with my Toyota Tacoma, I felt it was time to change. After comparing the Tacoma, Frontier and Ridgeline, I went with the Ridgeline because of the ride, comfort and storage room. All three are solid bets, depending on your need. Some say the Ridgeline is not a real truck but I have had it off road with no problems. I love this truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Storage trunk in the bed. Two way rear door. Power sliding rear window.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted a truck that drove like a car and would do the odd errand to Home Depot to pickup garden supplies or home renovation supplies, move the odd furniture and go camping. It's a quiet comfortable truck that really rides and feels like an expensive SUV.</TEXT>
