<TEXT>I traded in a 2007 G coupe 6MT for a 2008 also 6 MT. The shifter and especially the clutch in the 07 was awful. The 08 is improved although not perfect. Otherwise this car is amazing in every way. It's really a little surprising that Nissan can make this car for this price point. It really looks, feels and drives like a much more expensive car. Really unbelievable!!!! Great job Nissan and your Infiniti cohorts. In my first 1000 miles MPG, hiway is 24-25 and expect to improve a bit with break-in. Only change would be to give just a little more off the line, although I imagine that would stress the components more with 330 horses on tap. Also would be nice to see the rev match shift!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rumble at idle, the feel and sound of the engine and exhaust as you climb past 4000 rpm. Smooth handling in hi speed maneuvers. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I can reiterate all the good reviews. This car is fun to drive in all conditions and can smoke the tires with ease. I recommend driving with the VDC off so you can really have fun. The VDC can be a bit too overbearing for my tastes. First let me say that the G37S is hands above most cars to compare, so my very minor complaints are just because when you stare at almost perfection, you are bound to find something. The 5-speed shifter throw is too long for my tastes. For a sports car the 1-2 shift should be the shortest possible, and it is not. Again, minor. The tires are great combination, but in the larger rims, they are very expensive to replace. Really, a great car. Drive it and see.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>True combination of sport and luxury. Fun to drive. Exhaust note is a symphony. Athletic body.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the G37 for myself as a 40th birthday splurge. This is the best sports coupe your money can buy without completely splurging and buying a Corvette. Plus, it seats 4 halfway comfortably! I've owned this car for over one year, and it still feels like a new toy every time I drive it, or even look at it. I'm a very thorough researcher, and I couldn't find another car with the performance, looks, and features of this one in the price range. Once I test drove it, the decision was a complete no brainer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Intelligent cruise control - I always drive with cruise control, unless I'm in really thick traffic. All I have to do is steer. There's a long list of other favorite features - power, steering, braking, handling, interior comfort, navigation, paddle shifters. A terrific automobile.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car to replace my G35 Coupe, that car was totaled. This car rides sooo much better, the old car had the sport suspension and all of the bells and whistles as does the G37, I ordered a fully optioned G37 Journey with all of the packages. I checked the Beemers and was not impressed at all, their dealer experience leaves much desired. Also considered the Subaru WRX Sti, too much $$ for a souped up econobox. I've only put about 3600 miles on her, but every time I take it out I love the car more and more. The remark about the rear seat being cramped is wrong except for maybe head room. Overall fantastic car that looks more exotic and expensive than it really is!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is simply the best car I have ever owned, sporty tuned ride with luxury interior, beautiful leather! My z4 was too stiff!! The G37 was not only the best value but the best car under 35k period! The A4 is under powered as is the 328i which comes with fake leather in the base... Its only comp is the 335i and the A5 but they cost so much more! and the 335i just isn't that comfortable to drive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought a 2008 G37S with premium package. Wanted something more performance oriented and this car fits the the bill. The looks are great esp. with the 19 inch rims. Ride is comfortable even with sport package. My major concern was seating comfort as I'm 6'5" and 250lbs. And let me say this car has more seating room then the Lincoln LS I traded in. With the wide range of seat adjustments I fit in this car with no issues either from leg room or headroom (with sunroof). The only minor issue is the seat width is a little narrow for me but not a major inconvenience. Back seat room is fine for occasional passengers. My 6'3 brother fit in the back with no problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Awesome car in every way. It isn't a feather-weight car or a fuel-sipper, however. would like more torque (nit-picking of course). 330 horses come to life after 30/40 mph where you get a non-stop surge of power. Excellent build quality and design. I've owned a BMW and a Lexus before. This is the best! Not a huge fan of the analog clock in place of digital clock. Tilt/push operation for the passenger seat for backseat ingress/egress is overly complicated; every new passenger gets confused about how to tilt the front seat to get in/out of the back seats. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Standard 18" look good. Nice, thick steering wheel. Deeper exhaust note than the previous G35. Impressive build quality. Very strong engine and a respectable mpg despite my extra-heavy lead foot. Awesome design-- interior and exterior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2003 G35 coupe and considered a 3series BMW, Audi A5, and IS350 along with the new G37. After test driving all of them and pricing them out, this car couldn't be beat. I loved my G35 coupe, and the G37 is even better. It is a real head turner on the road-- I've been stopped by strangers in parking lots and at stoplights who tell me how great looking my car is. Drive is much smoother than my G35 coupe-- quieter too. A real pleasure to drive. I agree with other posters-- don't buy this car and complain about gas mileage. This is a performance car and having lower gas mileage is a small price to pay for such a luxury car at an affordable price. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had a 330Ci & M3 before getting the G and I have liked most things better. The bimmers seem quicker since the G is such a heavy car. However, the G seems more refined than the M3 which suffered from a loose and clunky differential. The G's differential is much tighter giving an overall smoother & solid feeling. However, the clutch uptake is abrupt (similar to bmw). The navigation of the G is more user friendly, even compared to the iDrive in the newer bmws. It is touch screen and voiced activated. The G37 is a better value since you get more included options rather than having to add them separately like German cars.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A smoother and overall more solid feeling car compared to my past bmws which gives me confidence in its reliability. More 'bang for your buck' features compared to BMWs. Fuel economy is not as bad as some say - it's comparable to an M3 (about 22 mpg mixed city/hwy) if you're not always racing it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have 5K miles and love the car. Hard to see well with the mirrors. Have a big dent in the cool looking aluminum inside door handle where seatbelt flung back and tagged it. Goes fast enough for me. Happy with it. Got a speeding ticket my first month and I wasn't even speeding. Cop had new Dodge Charger interceptor. My first sports car. Wheels get caught in ruts in interstate, and have to constantly readjust when driving. Moving GPS map is very helpful. Cell phone to car interface is way cool, so easy to use. My teenager kids love it too. Don't like speedometer, missing many in between numbers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving a Nissan 350-Z for the past couple of years, it was time for a more comfortable daily driver. Since, I love my Z so much, it only made sense to look at an Infiniti G- 37. I went with the G-37S with the Premium and Sports packages. I love the Bluetooth connection and stereo system. I opted not to get the back up camera and Navigation as I've lived just fine for years without them. I also looked at Lexus, Mercedes and BMW, but I liked the G-37 the most. After the 350-Z, good handling was a must as was peppiness. I expect a car to go when I step on it and this car does not disappoint! It is a fun, responsive car to drive and I love it. I have not regretted purchasing it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After testing many, many cars to replace my '04 G35 Coupe, I returned to the Infiniti. You cannot beat the combination of performance, quality, style and value in a coupe in this price range. I was a little reluctant to buy the "same" car again but the new one is an upgrade in almost every aspect. Much nicer interior, controls and features. Nicer to drive on everyday basis. Navi system much better than in my Acura TL. Have not had chance to put car to a test yet but seems to have a little better handling than '04 but acceleration about the same. With more torque, this would be a really great performer. Styling classy but understated.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling. Paddle shifters with down shift rev matching. Navi system. Great seats, although a little narrow. Beautiful interior. Very fast once you get the revs up a little.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The G37s is drop dead gorgeous and a blast to drive. Handling and acceleration are excellent. I compare the acceleration and handling of the G37 (manual trans) favorably to other cars I've owned in the past (a Mustang GT 06 and BMW 528i 01, both with manual trans). The G37 comes with all the comfort features and amenities you could possibly want in a luxury coupe, for a third of the price of comparable cars. This car is a keeper for years to come and is destined to become a classic. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, handling, acceleration, Bose premium sound system, and bucket seats. The exhaust note is appealing. I like the Bridgestone Potenzas and how they stick the car to the road during all driving conditions. The car feels very safe and secure when pushed above normal limits.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded CLK 430 for 08 G37S and I truly miss my 430 but am delighted with the G37S. It gets lots of looks the engine is amazing both sound and pull. Coming from the V8 I couldn't just get any V6 so the G37 gave me that exhaust rumble that I was accustomed to. The features in the car made the CLK feel like it was from the 70s and the reliability will let me sleep at night.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had Bimmers for several years and still like them. Tried to trade in my 03/Z4 for a 08/330 coupe but felt like I got the brush off from the saleman. Went across the street and purshased the G37 that evening. Purely amazed that I found a car that not only was several thousand less than the BMW but could run with it as well. Interior and exterior fit and finishes are fantastic. But the best experience is to hop in and let her run. WOW! My MPG is averaging right at 26mpg out on the highway and 23mpg combined. Can't wait to see the convertible when it arrives. </TEXT>

<TEXT>As an owner of Acura, Lexus and Mercedes I have to say this trumps all of them in what you get for the money. The car is fast, affordable and fun. Can't beat the two year lease Infiniti usually offers on the car. Other favorite features include attention grabbing looks,and intuitive navi system. However, the build quality could be better on the car, where I've had a problem with the muffler in the first few thousand miles, although that was only on early models from what I've heard. Also, I wouldn't label the car a true sports car since in the corners it could be a little more nimble. 3 series beats it in that. Overall, an amazing car and still my realistic dream car that I'm so proud to own</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I trade car picks every 3 years we trade, this year was mine, traded a 05 G35 sedan. Great car the G37, Premium pkg with Sports package, must haves!!! Car handles great, rides comfortable for low profile sticky tires. Shifting is smooth, paddles work well. Suggest 3m clear bra or other for front... love bugs. We gave up some space for this car, but as soon as you drive it you appreciate the reasons. Fit and finish of the car is great and Infiniti is making deals so go out a buy one and experience a Ferrari for 1/5th the price</TEXT>

<TEXT>The G37S is the epitome of luxury sports cars. VQ engine is Nissan's BEST and it shows. Power is great, tuning is great, 330 Hp and 270 ft-lb of torque is what keeps you behind the wheel. Looks great and turns heads. 20 MPG city is reasonable (it's not a hybrid) and reflects actual mileage. Definitely a winner over 350Z, 330i, Audi, and altima coupe. This may be your last chance to own a high-powered sports car with a REAL manual transmission as CVT and slushboxes are getting more acceptance with their "fake" shift controls.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine: Everything about it, power curve, torque curve, exhaust note (Mmmm). Luxury leather interior (in black) looks great. Exterior appearance is athletic. Brakes and 19" wheels stand out. It's a formidable looking car. Back seat is actually functional for kids. Keyless entry is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the G37 after a lengthy comparison to the BWW 335, Lexus GS 350, and Mercedes E550. The G37 was the last one that I drove. It only took 20 minutes for the Infiniti to win me over. Power with Grace is the way that I describe it. I was recently on a stretch of new freeway driving 70, kicked it and 135 came a lot quicker than I could believe. Handles well at high speed. My wife loves it so much that she is buying th eG37 convertible as soon as they are released. </TEXT>

The music box is all I listen to now and is awesome. Tires are starting to feather a bit on front already, will most likely give me the dreaded tire growl at only 4K. yuk Nissan.

The car is luxurious and appropriately sporty. I forwent the Sport Pkg. because I am 36 and the sportiest car is no longer the most important to me. The all season tires should last a bit longer. The ride is a bit nicer and the seats are just as comfortable in my opinion. I don't think I'll miss the larger brakes and the limited slip diff.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a G37 S Journey with sports package nav, premium, 19 in wheels - loaded. Got the auto, disappointed infiniti does not have a 6 spd auto or DSG type transmission. I would say this is the only issue with the car. The car is responsive, steering is a little light at high speeds. Controls are easy to use- voice commands in the car are easy. The interior is good (not as good as an audi). I would recommend black interior which has white stitching. The tan or gray interiors look cheaper. Gas is atrocious but there is cost for the pleasure you get when driving this car. I am happy overall. Consider a 335I coupe and M3. Got the car below invoice. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Now that I have driven over 5000 miles in this dream, I have to make a change to my earlier review. First of all, the MPG has definitely improved. I was able to drive from Miami to Jacksonville without having to refuel! I even had about a 1/4 tank left after the trip. Secondly, I still think the seats are too narrow in the front but they are bolstered very well for aggressive corners. Finally I complained about the build quality and interior design but they are both excellent, I just wish these birds would stop targeting my paint! Infiniti has a winner here. Go out and buy one you will love the drive, the performance and all the attention and compliments you get.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this vehicle! It performs as well as a 3 Series BMW, without the extra increase in price that the BMW has. It looks much better than the BMW too! I got the 6MT and the engine feels like it just can keep going with no problem. Beautiful finish and top-notch quality of materials round out an awesome package. My only little quibbles are the lack of more storage space in the center console, and the somewhat thirsty engine coupled with the price of Supreme Unleaded. I was prepared for the fuel economy, so that was not a major problem for me. I add it here as a caution to gas concerned folks. Again for me the major problem is the center console. Otherwise A+++ rating for performance/luxury.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had MB-C320 and I was thinking between Audi A5, BMW 335 and G37S. I test drove all three several times and at the end, the G37S was the winner for several reasons and number one was the deal that I got. My G37S is fully, fully loaded, I get the performance, look, options, responsiveness, speed and power that I wanted for half price of A5 and I am very happy with my decision. My friends come over to my house just to go drive around with the car. I get good compliments all the time in the streets.

<TEXT>This car is absolutely a joy to own. Not only does it have a 330 HP engine that is fun to drive but all the features and options this car has is unbelievable. The Bose system in the premium package is one of my favorite things about this car. It is so clear and if you like loud stereo's, you can crank it up to really feel the 2 10" subs. Everything from the design, performance, luxury and affordability makes this car a must have for any sort of car enthusiast. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the best car I have own in my life so far. I test drove BMW 335i prior to this vehicle. Both cars felt very fun to drive. Is BMW worth extra $5K? Definitely NOT. G37's styling looks much sportier than 335i coupe. Redlining at 7500 rpm feels like a true sports car! The sound of the exhaust is truly awesome! I look forward to drive my car after a long hard day's work. 19 in rims look great!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling (plenty of compliments from my friends and coworkers), FUN to drive, quality of build. I am a music nut (own over 600 CDs). Optional Bose system kicks! Silver or graphite silver looks the best!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a Lexus coupe for this vehicle with the Sports and Navigation packages and I haven't looked back. Fun to drive, the brilliant red is an eye catcher and it's packed with electronic toys. Overall, this car is a blast. You can't help but punch it a little when accelerating and that does impact the fuel milage. I don't understand why the interior wood trim option is not allowed with the sports package. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2007 BMW 328i (because it was constantly in the shop) for the new 2008 G37. Got the sport, premium and navigation package. This car rocks! So much better than the BMW. Handling is great, navigation package is awesome and very easy to use. There's even a 9 GB hard drive in the car so you can rip your CDs to it. The system also controls your iPod with ease. The 330 HP engine is very powerful. Gas mileage is so-so, but that's expected with all the power you get. I definitely recommend this car! Go and test drive one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Infiniti won! for a few months now I have been debating on my new car. The cadillac cts-v has been on my wish list for a few years now. Early march 08 I took a trip to go test drive the CTS and my wife said "Hey there is an Infiniti dealership on the way, let's stop in and look." Needless to say I never made it to the Cadillac. I am 6'4" 300lbs, and i sit comfortably in the G37. The front seats feel like LazyBoy recliners. The pep is nice but I notice a slight delay from the time I floor it to the accelaeration throwing me into the seat, but it is easy to point out a flaw when there is only one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Journey with Premium/Nav/Sport. Best value for the money. BMW 335 much more expensive and many features not available on it. Paddle shifting 5 speed isn't great, I leave it in auto. Auto needs at least 6 gears. Great quality seats. Feels slower than my CLS500 but its not broken in yet. Traded my 2004 WRX for it and no regrets at all. Most technically advanced car I have ever driven, executed well, easy to use. Even my wife likes it. Says she gets more looks than when she is driving her G500. I see many G35 coupes on the road, that's a negative. When I first saw the G37 on the road I thought it was a Lexus, good thing. Previous version was too "slab-like". No regrets at all.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased my G37 journey with sports pak in late feb. Nice finish and trim. Sexy exterior with great , easy to clean alloy rims. Still breaking it in, so it might be a minute before I open her up. Please keep her under 70 mph until 1500 miles. I was told by a very reliable source. I have had 14 BMWs and love my german cars. But I needed to change up! Infiniti should work on their dismal gas mpg (I'm getting 13.4) and tighten up the steering ratio.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just recently purchased the G37 coupe and I am enjoying every minute I am in the car. Prior to the G37 coupe I was driving the BMW 525i and prior to that the BMW 325i and I can tell you that the G37 coupe is more fun to drive and has more options than the comparable BMW for considerably less money. The power and sound of the 330 horsepower engine is awsome. The interior is luxurious and sporty and all of the controls are easy to use and well placed. Any person looking for a new coupe needs to consider the G37 because I believe you will be pleasently surprised that you will get so much car in this market segment for the price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has turned heads from day one. I am often with people who drive vehicles 2 or 3 times more expensive and still they constantly comment on how beautiful it is. Great power, perfect styling, and incredible luxury for the price. Only complaint is if you are over 6 ft (I am 6'2") you may have to lean the seat back a bit as to not make contact with the roof. Even with that said never once have I in the 3 months I've driven it have I been less than thrilled with my purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did a great deal of research, and a number of test drives of Acura, Lexus, BMW, etc. before I finally decided to get my Infiniti. For me, it came down to the Lexus IS350, BMW 335i & Acura TL-S. I simply could not justify the extra $$ for the Bimmer considering what the Infiniti offered (great quality, comparable sportiness, for less money). I have not had the car long, but have already rec'd compliments on it. After all, isn't that partly why we get these kinds of cars to begin with - to turn heads?!</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you?re looking for an all around fun car look no further. This car has the performance you are looking for and enough convenience items to make it civilized enough to deal with a 45 mile commute. I looked at a lot of different sport coupes but found this one gave the best price and performance combination. I test drove the BMW 3, Audi S5, Porsche Cayman and the Vette (go fast, go straight) ? they all seem to have one thing in common 46K or better. But the Infiniti with all the bells and whistles to give the car a civilized feel still came in 5K less then the rest. The cars only drawback is fuel economy, don?t believe the MPG numbers, I am not even close. Combined city & hwy MPG is 17</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car performs amazingly well for a luxury car. It is fast and fun, but still has that "executive" feel of a luxury car. I love that by getting just the Premium Pkg, you essentially get all of the goodies that I wanted and can keep the price of this car around $37K. There really are only a couple of RWD luxury sport coupes available with a stick under $50K, and this is by far the best deal. As good as a Bimmer (I drove each several times) for about $10K less.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just replaced my 2005 G35 coupe with a 2008 G37S. Overall, I'm very impressed with the G37 - it's better than the G35 in almost every way including better ride quality, improved sound dampening, tech features (long list of them), interior design... the list goes on and on! The only changes I could suggest would include eliminating the shifter vibration, like the BMW 3-series. In my opinion, the vibration goes 180 degrees in the opposite direction of this more refined revision. Also, the torque seems to be in the mid to high rpms, and I would prefer low end torque. Unless I punch the gas off the line, it feels like I'm crawling. The G37 is a great car... just shy of perfect.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned a 2001 330i for 4 years and have loved the car. During my research for a replacement I felt I should look at Infiniti as well as BMW (335 vs. G37). Both are great cars and if you go by just the professional drivers reviews from the magazines you might lean toward the more expensive BMW (I was). I drove them both and at the end of the day I felt the ride quality, interior layout, technology, unique exterior, and "grin factor" of the G37 to be superior to the 335. These are the things that matter to me. In addition, in the real world you will never notice or take advantage of any perceived performance advantages either vehicle might have. So, more vehicle for for 8k less..YES!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Went with Journey with Prem. and Sport Options. Coming from Lexus and looking for more of a sports car and this car fits the bill with power and looks. I do not expect to have any problems with a foreign make like Infiniti similar to Lexus,which was important. I wanted more time on the roads and less in the shop. First thing to do is change out standard air filters with 2 K&N Air Filters! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've driven Porsches, BMWs, and a Corvette. This one beats them all as for my personal taste. I look forward each time to drive my new G37 car. The technological advancement from my old G35 2005 to G37 2008 feels like 10 years difference. I'm a big fan of manual shift gears on cars but the Paddle Shifter is so much fun to use. Especially, I get busy making my calls while I drive most of the time. I just experimented recording with the digital flash card to play music and it sounded awesome. I can't believe we're living the day and age of advanced technoloy today. On this car it's true that you get more than what you pay for. I can't wait next week when I install my Infiniti exhaust system</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the GPS features, the bluetooth convenience with verbal commands. The option of Gear Shifter to F1 Paddle Shifter is so much fun. The ride is so much quieter with better sound insulation from the road noise which helps when I'm on the phone compare to my old 2005 G35 Sport.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove the Porsche 911, BMW 335 & M Roadster, S2000, Corvette and decided on the G. I have the Blue Slate w/every option except 4wheel steering. I've had the car for four weeks and I don't regret a thing. The power is on point, the electronic gismos are easy to operation, handling is responsive. I haven't opened her up because of the required break in period of 1200 miles. I'm at 800 now. Pound for pound, you can't go wrong. This is my first Infiniti product and I'm loving every minute. A word of caution. On model produced after July 07, you lose some of the voice features such as telling the car what temp to change to and what radio station.

<TEXT>2008 Journey w/Sport/Navi/Premium Platinum Graphite/Stone This car has it all for a coupe. 450 miles on the engine and breaking it in easy, but can tell there is a lot of power waiting to be unleashed. Great handling, great sound system, the navi system with real time traffic is accurate and easy to use. Video inputs as well, can play PacMan on the navi with those battery powered old arcade games. 19 inch wheels with Sport Pkg are really nice looking. A bit bumpy on those weird sections of highway but overall a nice ride for a Sport model. The auto trans shifts nicely up/down, very comfortable shifting. Paddle shifters and DS drive modes make this coupe worth getting as an automatic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I enjoy my G37 S 6-speed. It has every option except nav and Tech. pkg. I don't agree that this car is fast, it's quick, but not fast. If this car can drop 200 lbs and add 35 pounds of torque, it would be in the BMW 335ci class as far as being quicker. Without the torque, I would say this car is a touch behind BMW in the performance area, but it makes up for it by being less expensive and I would say more reliable than the BMW. Infiniti has come a long way since my 2003 G35 coupe. If you are looking for a good looking coupe for around $40k, this car is hard to beat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This 2008 is so much better than the previous model. After 3 weeks I have to say this car with all options is almost everything I was hoping for. I?ve been driving Mustang GTs for many years so this car is so much more refined and luxurious. The sound system and nav are excellent. High speed (100MPH) on the highway is very well controlled and surprisingly quiet in both road and wind noise. The power band on this engine does not come alive until you get above 3000 RPM. I?m used to lots of V8 torque, and this otherwise excellent engine just does not have that torque. But rev it up beyond 4000 and it will pin you back nicely. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Audio system with line input, iPod controller, built in hard drive, and compact flash port. The interior with the Washi trim. The exterior shape is just beautiful, better than others in this category (like 335 coupe). So many features in this baby it staggers my mind.</FAVORITE>

I don't find the automatic lagging, nor do I think the shifts are harsh. Moving the lever into 'sport' mode makes a difference, too :) Went from a 2006 Audi A6 to this, mainly for the fun quotient. Has all the tech goodies from the A6, and then some.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just picked up my 2008 G37 Journey last night. I already have a few hundred miles on it and I absolutely am in love with this car. It has a red exterior and black interior, with the Premium, Navigation, Technology and Sports packages. It also came with the spoiler, splash guards and cargo net. It's a dream to drive. Quiet on the inside with a sweet exhaust note. Even with the Sports package, it rides really well. It is a really refined and well-built car. It has so many "toys" that I don't know where to start. It's a beautiful car and it's getting a lot of attention and positive comments. This one is destined to be a classic. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>So many favorite features. The navigation system is great. Being able to talk to the car and control functions is astounding.

It looks great. Before I bought the 6 speed manual, I test drove the automatic. The automatic was a complete letdown for me. The shifting was not smooth at all and the acceleration was not there.

<TEXT>I just test-drove the G37 Sport automatic. My first impression: this is the first Japanese car I've driven (I own the G35 6MT with the Brembos) that feels exactly like a German sports car. Seriously. The Sport G37 is tight and solid, with a really surprising balance of sport verve and comfort. The car really feels likes a BMW or Mercedes, but with more edge. Yet it is still distinctly Japanese in its design, if not feel. The exterior is probably the most sumptous, sophisticated sport car design out now for a production sports car. The interior is slick, with cool details, such as the outstanding brushed alum "washi" trim.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A true taut, refined sports car. Perfect balance of sports car rawness with carefully added refinements. External design - wow! Best nav system out there. Unique Japanese aesthetic touches. </FAVORITE>
