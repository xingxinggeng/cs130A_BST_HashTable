<TEXT>Convertible is one that actually can comfortably hold 4 - with my two active sons in the back seat. It has very nice ride, especially on the highway. Navigation system could be improved to allow adjustments while moving. Voice recognition better than others used. Overall an enjoyable car to take out on ride, especially on a nice sunny day, with enough room for the family and all the junk in the trunk.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Convertible quick to go down, large back seat, interior finish excellent, large trunk, comfortable ride. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first non BMW car in 10 years. This is also my first Toyota ever. I am very surprised about the quality. Ride is a little noisy but it's a convertible. Other that that I love this car, smooth ride and with the top down it is the most fun car I have ever owned. Fits a family of four comfortably & I am lost without the nav. Besides normal maintenance have not had a problem since the day I rolled it off the lot, and I drive 150 miles a day.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>NAV. Big trunk. Turns heads (get a lot of compliments on it).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car for a great price towards the end of February. It's not the top of the line model but it has the moonroof, 6 disc, and the alarm system. Yes, there is some tranny lag and no, I haven't yet taken it in for the re-flash as I don't think that it will affect it much anyway. I've found that the slow shifts do not occur when the shifter is in manual shift mode & I'm having a blast shifting in manual through town and when merging. Gas MPG has improved @30 MPG combined with 4200 miles which is very acceptable being that my 05 XB gets 33 mpg. The Solara rides very smooth, the front strut tie bar keeps the front end flat and the trunk is huge. Headlights are great & cd display dim.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seat comfort, ride, handling, and MPG. I like that the gas tank is 18.5 gal for extended cruising. Headlight distance is excellent. Very quiet ride with the windows and roof closed. Lighted Gauge display is cool and 6 disc is good for road trips. LED tail lights and the exterior styling superb.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had reservations about buying a car I knew was no longer being manufactured. However, there simply is not a convertible out there that provides the smoothness, comfort, feature set, and room anywhere near this price point. And the close-out incentives were certainly compelling. This car is not about driving excitement. Freeway curves easily taken at 80 in my 3-series need to be adjusted down to 60 in the Solara. Acceleration is good, but not dramatic. However, everything about this car exudes refinement - whisper-quiet Lexus grade engine, solid thunk of the trunk, smooth switch gear, damped cup holder cover, efficient top mechanism.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Feels rich, high feature content, expected Toyota reliability, quiet, comfortable, roomy, smooth, night sky above</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The auto trans is very very slow to downshift, in fact, there is at least a 2-3 second lag when you push the accelerator, to the power getting to the wheels. The motors revs then trans engages. Dealer loaded the new ECM software, but it made little if any difference. Dealer said he did all he could and the trans is considered fixed and normal by Toyota. Sure shocks me if Toyota engineers consider this normal. If you get one, be careful when pulling into traffic or when quick acceleration is necessary. The trans will scare you. I won't keep this Toyota for 150K miles as I did with the car I sold to get this 08. Very disappointing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a very comfortable convertible and can actually hold two people in the back seat! The car has enough power for most situations. The trunk is great (roomy) for a convertible. Needs automatic seat adjustment, larger rear window, and a better navigation system. The navigation system will tell you to turn once you are past the turn!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Disappointed that the new engine and trans needs a TSB update (0068-08) to fix poor shifting and acceleration. Disappointed that the radio display is very weak/dim and unviewable with sunglasses. Disappointed that the brakes grab and are noisy. Disappointed with rattles and squeaks that have already cropped up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car is for my wife. She wanted quiet, comfortable, sporty and spacious. Not an easy combination for a convrt under $30K. Tested: Sebring V6, Mustang V6 & VW Eos converts. Solara has best combination of space, features and price. This was 4th and last car we drove. She knew she wanted it at only 30 seconds into the test drive. Pluses 1. Top that does NOT fold down into fairly roomy trunk. You won't have to rearrange the contents of the trunk to put the top down. Ever. 2. Practically no engine and wind noise 3. Comfortable rear seating (true but hard to believe) 4. Solid comfortable ride & handling 5. Excelent ergos and cockpit for driver & front passenger 6. Peppy engine No Minuses</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Toyota has a unique combination of workmanship, ergonomics, engine performance, handling and functionality. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We test drove 2 other converts. and the Solara was by far the most comfortable and by far the most quiet, absolutely no wind noise. A wonderful car to drive with top up or down. My only disappointment was no back-up assist available,no power seats available on passenger side or 8cyl. up-grade. I would buy the same car again after driving it for one year.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Larger than average trunk for a convert. Cup holder in console will accommodate 2 large cups and interior leather styling makes it look expensive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My retirement car after looking at many convertibles. Love the car with the top down, but hate it with the top up because of the rattles in the back side windows, especially the passenger side). On bumps or rough roads, the window sounds like it is going to fall out of track. It started when I drove it off of the dealership lot and I was assured it would be fixed, but after several attempts to fix it, including shims being put in the back side window and a tear in the headliner while trying to fix it, I have now been told by the dealership and Toyota Corp. that there is nothing that can be done, that it is problem with this model. A $32,000 car and nothing can be done!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior is very comfortable and roomy and good trunk space. Good gas mileage. Top easy to put down</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In white frost this is a real head turner - it really is a Lexus 430 with a Toyota badge. The styling makes a statement - this is one very striking car to drive. With the top down and the boot cover on it draws observers and great comments. The top does have a blind spot and the boot fills the trunk but I can live with those inconveniences. The interior is roomy, all controls are of quality and this is clearly one very premium car. Performance is excellent, the engine is quiet, and the transmission is really seamless. Mileage is 25 MPG - not bad for luxury. What a wonderful ride!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall this car is a winner. It's fun to drive and very smooth (like a Lexus). I bought this car because of its room and style. Fits four adults comfortably and also can fit three teens in the back (need to cross-over the seat belts). I wish it had a little more pick up but hasn't been a problem. Wish the driver seat had a memory for at least one driver. Bluetooth for phone doesn't allow name of person calling to be programmed. Doesn't have the RDS (radio display signal).</TEXT>

<TEXT>The test drive in the rain with the top up impressed me. The quietness and the solid, confidence inspiring handling were very impressive. Love the gauge illumination at night too. The 6's performance seems fine to me and great gas mileage too! Car trip with only 200 miles on the odo got 30+ mostly highway mpg at 70. Top down on the highway is fine too- not too much wind and able to talk in a normal tone w/o windscreen. The nav system is not as intuitive as my Garmin Nuvi but does have its pluses. Voice activation commands with the top down is iffy. Luckily this can be done manually. Radio is nice, rear visibility is ok with mirrors and seat adjusted properly. Tilt & tele wheel is great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The top, the quietness, solid build and great handling feel like my former Lexus. Performance and gas mileage are great. Like the ability to lock the trunk and glovebox access and the valet key. Cool lit gauges. Comfortable multi adjusting front seats and roominess of the back seat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased the dark grey on black w/ black top three weeks ago. First convertible ever. Great so far. Dozens of compliments already. The sport trim rocks! Getting 28 and some change on the mpg, mostly hwy. Rides very smooth, a great cruiser, turns lots of heads. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drop top is way too easy to operate, even at a light if it starts to rain. The overall styling of the sport trim is just nasty!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It has been an awesome car. From the day we picked it up, the only time it went back to the dealership was for routine maintenance. Everything about the Solara is great. Comfort, ease on the road, handling, braking - it's all good. When you close the door, it sounds solid. Toyota built one outstanding car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted a convertible so badly and picked this one (my first Toyota). It has the worst pickup of any car I have ever driven. My VW Beetle was more powerful than this car. I am hesitant when on a ramp to get on a highway because the car fails the get up and go you need. My lease is over in two years and I can't wait!!! On the positive side, it is nice to drive with the top down on a nice day. Oh by the way, the rear window is very poor in terms of visibility so be careful when backing up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Good car, but the first one we got had a huge flaw in the mounting of the driver's side door which cause water to come into the car. Car was swapped for a duplicate model and we've been happy so far. Check the door for fit. Car drives very well but don't expect sporty speed or cornering - it's not that kind of car. Interior is well designed except for crummy cupholders. Love the aux jack and its location. Multifunction display is actually useful. Roof operates well but the lack of independent control for the rear windows is odd and annoying. Roof quality is excellent but the blind spot is larger than my previous convertibles. Overall: B+ to A-</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior of car is excellent. Aux jack and location is great. Multifunction display is useful but not overwhelming. Smooth top made of nice materials. Engine is smooth and quiet. Came with a nice set of Michelin tires instead of normal low-end Bridgestone rubber.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the 2008 SLE V-6 just last week. I love it! After having a 4-Runner for 11 years, I knew buying another Toyota would be the right move. I never dreamed it would be such an awesome car to drive. The ride is very smooth and stable. The safety features make me feel as safe as when I drove my SUV. The pick-up it has is great, and the ride is just as comfortable on the highway as in the city. The trunk is huge. I love having a sporty car that is not "tiny". Good job again, Toyota</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the 2008 Version 4 cylinder model I drove the 6 and the 4 and decided on the 4 because I didn't sense much of a difference. I seem to choose cars that end production the year I buy them. I had a great Celica. I am more than pleased with performance. Mileage stated on the sticker was 21 31 and so far after about 3000 miles I am getting 28 39 , so I am very pleased with that. Rides very smoothly. No problems at highway speeds. Rear seats fold down so along with the roomy trunk there is plenty of storage room.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Everything about the car is above average except 2 things. Pros: 1) Quiet and comfortable ride. 2) Comfortably seats 4 passengers including the driver. 3) Hybrid between a luxry sedan and a convertible so you have best of both worlds. Cons: 1) Navigation system was a bit disappointing. It does not speak the street names like the Garmin nuvi series. 2) Need more power as not very responsive when you hit the gas pedal. 3) Rear view limited when backing up.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1) Bluetooth with handsfree feature. 2) 4-disc changer with upgraded JBL speakers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did quite a bit of research and drove a number of convertibles before buying the Solara. All convertibles have "blind spots"... It is the nature of the car. I selected the Solara Sport convertible based on expected dependability (as per Consumer Reports, Edmunds, and Kelly Blue Book). I am not a "leather interior fan" and I liked the look/feel of the sport package fabric. The car has decent pick-up and provides acceptable MPG (I am getting about 24 combined so far, but I have less than 1,000 miles on the car, so I am hoping/expecting some improvement). </TEXT>

<TEXT>Back in 2006 I had hopes for the super red - sigh - only a black one available but color of car not that impt. I love driving this car. Now I have just gotten my second one, a 2008 Super RED. It's TDF imho. After owning various Lexus ES300, GS300 and ES350 models since 1993. I'm thrilled to now currently own 2 sport looking and super comfortable drive cars. In fact they remind me very much of my husbands stunning SC400 Lexus sport coupes. If you have the chance to get one of the SLEs before they are no longer available (sad, this is the last year for my fav. car) try to get one!:-)</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just returned from a 1300 mile trip to CA from AZ one wk after purchase. Very quiet, comfortable, and a sweet ride. Plenty of power from the V6 and no problems passing the slower 65 mph cars. Impressed with the mileage of 25.2 overall. Two-thirds of the trip were on the open road. Awesome Bluetooth and easy to use. Trunk is huge and more than enough room if you remove the boot cover. Slight shaking at low speed on a bumpy road. Hard to see sound sys. display in daylight wearing sunglasses. Looking for reasons to drive this great car. Not many of these on the road. You will love this car. Built solid. </TEXT>
