<TEXT>We average 24-25 MPG in mostly city driving, 26-27 on the interstate at approx 73 MPH!! Excellent! We test drove the RAV4 and CRV for comparison. The Rogue rides and drives better. The seats are more comfortable and the ride not as still as the others. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This was the 9th Nissan we bought in 10 years. My husband worked at nissan for 6 years and we were proud to drive cars with high quality. However, the Rogue is not an suv I would ever recommend! In 9 months we have had it in the shop 4 times. New ignition switch because it would not start sometimes. This still has not fixed the prob. The car was making noises when I idled around parking lots. They replaced the cv shafts and the transmission. The problem went away but has since returned. The dealer told me that Nissan has said that this is "normal" when a steel belt wears in and that I am just too picky with the noises that it makes. AWD transmissions will do this after 7,000- 10,000 miles</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned this car for about a year. GAs got to $.00 gal so had to try something else. I drove this the Honda CRV, and Toyota and found the best mixture of creature comforts was the Nissan. CRV had no get up and go, Toyota was to pricy for the product.This offered the best ride, economy, and value. We are considering getting another one for my wife. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Rogue since Dec of 2008.So far I've had to replace the transmission at 10,000 miles. So I am very disappointed in Nissian had high expectations for this vehicle. Sure hope Nissian can get thier act together and fix this defect. I've had Nissians in the past and this has mad me loose confidence in them.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We drive mostly in town, stop and go traffic (estimate 85%). Our gas mileage since purchase is 23.79 MPG for total mileage of 7000+ miles. It handles very well in town as well as interstate speed of 75 MPH. When climbing steep grades it is so smooth with the transmission. No sudden jerk it just varies itself and the engine speeds up smoothly to handle the grade. We have had it for 15 months and have not had to take it in for "ANY" problem. It is a great vehicle. I highly recommend it. Our only negative is the speedometer does not have a bright marker in 5 MPH increments. It is in 10 MPH Increments.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my Corolla S for the Rogue when my lease was up & I love it. Rear window takes some getting used to (so did my Prius) tho after 2 or 3 weeks it was nothing. Both my husband & myself find that it has a smooth ride & is very comfortable. I get pretty good mileage- 24.4-24.8 MPG for the life of the car average, which is 97% in town (compared to 30 in Corolla 1/2 fwy, 1/2 city) & I love to drive fast. I just can't resist in such a peppy car & in that aspect its way more impressive than the Corolla & its much bigger. Its very cute inside & out. Looked at 7 other cars before deciding on this one-I'm glad we waited! I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a car they will love.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT, Bose sound, mileage, peppiness, comfort, trunk organizer under the floor, interior space, vertical seat adjustment for the vertically challenged, such as myself (@ 5'3), works equally as well to give extra room for my dear husband who is 6'2ish; gas on the passenger side.. just everything!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Needed to buy a 4cylinder (sigh) as gas prices are SKY HIGH in Hawaii. So glad I chose the Rogue SL. It handles like a sedan except it's higher above the road - like an SUV. Turning radius is fantastic. Gas mileage is good and it really is FUN to drive! Bose system w/6 CD changer is a winner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my 2008 Nissan Rogue. It is my first "grown up" car, and I have thoroughly enjoyed having it. My husband and I are both over 6' tall, and we both fit comfortably in the front seats. The interior and exterior are very well-designed (this opinion is coming from a professional product designer). Nissan really did a great job of including a number of convenient features in the Rogue (i.e., a deep glove compartment, nice cup holders, an auxiliary plug, pen holders, insurance card holders, etc.). The Rogue comes with great safety features such as side curtain air bags and a tire air pressure monitor. These are great features that come standard on the base model Rogue S.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love having a back seat that folds down. It makes it easy and convenient to haul stuff. Those who need to carry lumber should get the Rogue SL; the front passenger seat folds down in that model but not in the S.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This CUV is very nice. I sold my Nissan Altima 2001 and got Rogue. One thing good about Nissan is, it will give so many options with a good price. If you go with Honda or Toyota, you have to pay for each option separately. This CUV drives like a car, sits high, fun to drive. The drive is almost smooth. One thing that bothered me is the small wind noise at high speeds( > 55 mph) other than that, I have no complaints. I feel like I am driving a good pimped up vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT> Had considered a CR-V, and even a Vibe, but the styling (and the gas mileage) really caught my eye. This is a fun vehicle to drive. It maneuvers easily and has lots of pep. We took it on an 1,800 road trip and there was plenty of power for passing at highway speeds. The CVT works smoothly. So far, mileage has been good; 25 combined and near 30 on the road trip.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had my Rogue for a week now, but am very happy. I traded an '04 Jeep Liberty. Great, smooth ride, although the CVT is taking some getting used to. Lots of bells and whistles that are nice. Interior is nice and roomy enough. Driver's seat is very comfortable with many options for adjusting the seat position, lumbar, etc. Gas mileage on my first tank was almost 25 mpg. Was hoping for more, but maybe that will improve once it's broken in. It handles very, very well. It's very stylish and I feel like I'm driving a super expensive car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Searched and checked out all the small SUVs and found the rogue to have the best combination of comfort, options, quality and price. Compared it to the Honda CRV and Toyota RAV4, test drove those and then finally the drove the Rogue--hands down the better driving experience, sometimes I forget that I am in an SUV and not a car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned for 1 month, 5700 miles and have have noticed only 1 easy to remedy problem... major blind spot on each side that I fixed with a $3 conical mirror. Otherwise my mpg has averaged over 27, ride is quite and very similar to my 350Z and wife's Altima. Nissan's aren't the smoothest ride but very comparable to Honda and Toyota and the Nissan 4 cylinder on cruise does maintain highway speeds and climbing hills much better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a 17 year old kid and I am in love with this Nissan. Have owned 2 others and they were very good. Since we own an Infiniti. But all I got to say is that I drive 350 miles back and forth to school and Nissan hit this crossover right on the head. Bluetooth works great with my blackberry. Bose which is the only audio system that I would get is very good. Seats are the most comfortable I have ever sat in. Has great utility. Xenons are nice and can't even explain the CVT its the best transmission in a car, it takes off like a rocket and the paddle shifters make it even better and it only has 170 hp and it moves. AWD is so solid I take ramps at 50 and the car holds nicely. Great driving experience.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth, CVT no gears means seamless takeoff like a rockship. Bose that makes the most out of the interior. Intellegent key, trunk size and utlity, awd that holds the road when Corning, xeons headlights, gas mileage 400 to a tank on straigh highway average about 24 mpg all the time.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Up to now I've driven 850 miles and car performed exceptionally well. No even small problems at all. It's fun to drive. CVT, when you are used to it, provides very smooth and comfortable ride, especially at traffic jams, and "stop and go". Brakes are excellent. Seats are comfortable, dash is elegant looking, especially at night. My Rogue is stripped down SL AWD version, so I can't say much about performance package, Bluetooth etc. The fuel economy was one of the selling points for me, and I'm having about 28.5 mpg with 70/30 mix. Considering that car still is braking in, that mileage is very good. Talking about reliability, there is no issues at all yet. Everything looks like build to last</TEXT>

<TEXT>After graduating from college and getting my first "real" job I decided it was time to upgrade my car. I've always wanted a Murano but couldn't see spending that kind of money. I saw a commercial for the Rogue and went to check it out. Fell in love right away. It's the perfect solution to not being able to afford the Murano. I love driving it! It's a great size and easy to park which is important for me b/c I park in small parking garages in Chicago. It drives so smooth and I love that you don't feel the engine shifting (or whatever). My gas mileage isn't great.. mixed hwy/city I've had 18 mpg, but I've only filled up twice. I'm keeping an eye on it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything!! I love the dashboard and the color of the lights. I don't have all the bells and whistles, just the standards and I am so happy with it. My gas tank does lock when the car is locked which is something I never even thought about until I got this car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've purchased Rogue 6 weeks ago as my wife commute car, but prefer to drive it myself to complete break in and check out vehicle performance. And I like to tell you that I'm absolutely satisfied with my purchase. It performs like a charm. The fuel consumption is top notch. I'm managing 28.7 mph average for last 600 miles. My commute is 80%/20% including multiple stop and go at rush hours. Internal design is perfect, comfortable seats, nice dash, and good quality material. Everything works perfectly. I highly recommended it to any one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wanted to get a 4 cylinder (traded in my Explorer) for the economy, and wasn't sure how I would adapt, but it's working out WAY beyond all expectations! I'm amazed at how quickly I am adapting. She's full of pep and as smooth a ride as you could possibly hope for. Doesn't feel small at all, but it's on a Sentra platform! Quite honestly, I actually look forward to the drive to and from work since I picked up my Rouge! Thanks Nissan! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I spent 3mo's researching cars and then wrecked my 03 Santa Fe about a week ago. Had to have SUV for AWD in winter. Considered Mit.Outlander, Sub.Forester and Rogue. Decided on Rogue for drive and features. Drove 200mi to pick up. Avg mpg on trip home was 26 on brand new motor!! A little disappointed in ride. Not as smooth as remembered in test drive, but it's okay. Got premium and tech pkg so have Bose, Bluetooth, XM, premium seats. Would have liked leather, but couldn't get all pkg'd with the color I wanted. (Gotham Grey) Would like more storage in front. Glovebox is huge, but not a lot of space for small things. I haven't had long enough to know for sure, but so far I really like it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering wheel controls with very clear Bluetooth. MPG. Color. Cargo area in back. Leg in room in back seat for 12yo and 10yo. Keyless features are really nice. Nice orange glow at night from dash, not to dim or bright. Adjustable headlight controls. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We love our new Rogue. Traded out of a RAM1500 quad cab, now getting almost double the mpg which is very nice. Drove all the vehicles in the small SUV segment, liked the Nissan the best overall. I splurged and got all the options; leather, moon roof, heated seats, paddle shifters, etc. I will be ordering the rear wing/spoiler as it wasn't available when I purchased my Rogue. I've had a ton of folks say they really like its looks. Avg MPG so far on 2 tanks of gas is 22.6 with a 60/40 split of city/hwy driving. Pretty good for something my wife and kids can fit in comfortably.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this crossover. The 1st thing you notice is it's beauty. I own the Iridium color. Just walking up to her makes you smile. She is very roomy inside. Perfect for tailgating. I even had them throw in the tent, awesome feature. The seats are very comfortable, better then my office chair. Very smooth ride on the road & the variable transmission is a joy to drive with no shifting motion. I am getting 25.1 to 25.4 MPG. The headrests are perfect for me. I am a small 5'4" 120 lbs female & this is the 1st car I ever owned where the head rest fits me. I truly do love this car and have no buyer's remorse.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Blue tooth phone feature Bose stereo system, keyless entry, variable transmission, comfort - absolutely amazing comfort. Design - she has a classy design that other crossovers lack. You can take her camping or drive her to a nice 5 star restaurant and she fits in at both locations. Inside very roomy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We are senior citizens and bought this car for the ease of getting in and out and wanted to sit up a bit higher when driving. This car surprised us with how much fun it is to drive. It is very smooth handling and so far great on gas, getting the 27 mpg it was said to get. It feels like you are driving a much smaller car. We had a Honda Accord before and this one handles much nicer believe it or not. You will not be sorry if you buy this car. You will love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned her since October. I just rolled 10,000 miles. She is fun to drive and is very obedient. Driving requests are fulfilled flawlessly. Steering is very responsive, as are braking and accelerating. CVT pulls hard under acceleration, making interstate merging quite easy. Very nimble in traffic, yet comfortable on the highway. Entry and exit very comfortable, as is the unlimited fan speed selector. Great move Nissan. Had two airbag service appt's but all fixed up now. You have to expect small hicups with a brand new model.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased my Rogue on Saturday. I got the Silver with Black interior. It looks like a luxury vehicle. It's so comfortable. Has lots of power (enough for me). Very quiet ride. Interior is very roomy. There is nothing bad I can say about my new Baby. Only time will tell. Bought the car brand new and put 200+ miles on it this weekend. Considered getting the CRV or RAV which are also beautiful, but it seems like everyone has one. The Rogue was the way to go for me. Beautifully built. Go Nissan! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in an older loaded Jeep Grand Cherokee for this & thought I'd miss the space but haven't had the first regret. I got mine loaded so the gadget factor is really fun! I didn't know how bluetooth worked so having it shut off my music for an incoming call is great-no more missed calls(and mic picks up my tot's voice in back great)! I love not having to deal with keys at all since I have a toddler. Love the Bose sound system but above all, love the ride! The drive is very smooth with CVT, once you're at speed it's SUPER quiet.. turn on jazz or classical for a great experience. It hugs the road too - didn't realize how bouncy the truck frame on my Jeep was. Avg'd 25 mpg. 10 stars! </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Long Commute Rogue</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I was searching for a crossover SUV with at least 27 mpg highway mileage. My work commute is 104 miles round trip, 90% of which is highway in Atlanta. I test drove many crossover SUVs (Honda CRV, Mazda CX7, and Toyota Rav 4) and liked Rogue the best. It had the quietest engine, nicest stereo, and most comfortable seats. After just 1,400 miles I am averaging 26.1 mpg. I am writing this because I read almost all 95 Edmund reviews for this car before making my decision. I thought it was only fair to return the favor. BTW - I am probably not the target consumer - I am 54 years old but love this fun car to drive combined with my moonroof, music, iPod interface and awesome Bose stereo system.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Moonroof, Bose stereo, stereo controls on the steering wheel, iPod interface, quiet 170 horsepower engine with pickup and power, and great miles per gallon. Also, can you believe the size of the glove box? Did I mention the Bose stereo sounds great. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I luv this car. It's compact and cute - IMHO it's the most eye-catching compact cross-over SUV in the market right now. Before we bought this car, we had test driven Honda CR-V, Subaru 2009 Forrester, RAV-4 and Matrix 2009 AWD. Rogue provides the best balance for what we are looking for in its segment. It's responsive, beautifully designed inside and out. The gas mileage is reasonable. Best of all, you get the best value out of the money you spend. Highly recommended.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Tested the CRV and the Rav4. Both were nice but not as good of a value as the Rogue. CRV was close but didn't handle as well. Rogue is slightly smaller. Much better feature list. Quieter than the competition. Sportier feel. Interior looks like a lux car. First 100 miles, 28mpg! Handled nicely in the rain. Zenon headlights are awesome in the dark. This is my 4th Nissan.

<AUTHOR>Really nice car</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>My wife and I traded down from a 2003 Murano (which we loved) to the Rogue for added gas mileage. Really was not too much of a compromise in features and comfort. Although slightly smaller, all of the features of the SL are similar to the base model of the Murano SL. The Rogue has impressive power for a 4 cyl. The interior has all of the options that you need in a car an none of the costly items like GPS,dual temp controlas and DVD. Surprisingly the gas mileage estimates are accurate for our driving style. Truly Nissan has created a veicle that is fun and affordable. Really worth the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched for about 6 months, test drove all Rogue competitors and finally bought the SL FWD with Premuim Package (which includes a 6-CD changer and moonroof). This was the best value for money. The design is smart, seats comfortable, dash lighting very soothing, controls conveniently placed and the sound system is commendable. The ride is very smooth (the CVT makes it smoother) and is the quietest among all its competitors. The vehicle is extremely responsive and has a tight turning radius. The suspension is remarkable, and I hardly feel the potholes I drive over. I have driven over patches of black ice on two occasions and both times the VDC kicked in and righted the vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Rogue since Dec 2007 - could not be happier with this sporty little SUV. I have driven everything from AWD minivans, Honda and Izuzu SUVs, and finally a Pacifica. My Rogue is by far my favorite, it could be that it is 'cute' and or that it has exceptional interior space compared to the exterior size. It has been reliable in the mountains of West Virginia and I have had no problems with bad roads. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for the functionality of a SUV but the handling of a car. I am glad I ignored all those people who told me not to buy a vehicle the first year it was released. </TEXT>

<TEXT> So far I've given my goth grey a good work out. It handled unimproved dirt roads like a champ, across boulder strewn creeks in the high desert foothills of Arizona to ten inch deep sand beaches in Mexico. The awd worked effortlessly. If you don't look at the rpm gauge it acts no differently than any other car in cruise or passing at highway speeds. I'll try it out next at the 6-7000 foot elevations in the northern part of the state this summer. My first fuel check with mixed driving conditions yieled 26.7 mph.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had an 94 Mazda 626 to replace. Drove past the Nissan dealer and stopped in to look at Rogue from TV ad. Test drove the vehicle and WOW, I bought the thing. Have an SL AWD with all options. I mocked the SUV crowd before but this is great vehicle. Live in Minnesota, but even when below zero and city driving, was getting 21-22 MPG. Got 28 on trip across Wisconsin. I think in warmer weather will see MPG go up. Very comfortable. Not one defect have I found to go back to dealer with. Very stable on snowy streets. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife needed a new car so after much searching we decided on the Rogue. It is a fine car for her and she really loves it. We have had many people stop us and ask about the car and everybody seems to have some interest in it. I really tested it 2 days later is 9" of wet and heavy snow and it exceded my expectations for sure. We have had our ignition keyswitch lock on us about 4 times and I had to rock the vehicle back and forth and shake the wheel to get it to release, since using the e-brake before parking it seems to take the pressure off of it. A grocery cart even at slow speeds will do damage to the plastic way to easily because of no bumpers. The rearview has a blind spot be careful.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A real nice alternative to the pricier RAV4, CRV, other crossovers, the Rogue is a smooth operator. Nicely appointed interior. Very comfortable car for long trips and the gas mileage on the highway is good. Good leg and headroom. Adequate storage in rear. Only complaint so far is that in town with hills, stoplights, and snow, gas mileage is not so great. But nimble in all weather and a nice, quiet ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have 320 miles on our Rogue, much of that was on the freeway driving home from the dealer (100 miles) and a long back-roads trip the next day. The car is flawless! 27 mpg so far and despite the complaints about what people call the 'rubber band' tranny (CVT), the car just seems to zoom when you step on the gas. I drove home from work today in a driving rainstorm with 30 mph cross winds and it hugged the road like it was on rails. And unlike our Jeep Cherokee, no body lean whatsoever. This is my second Nissan and 5th Datsun family product and they are far the best. We love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 35 years of MB ownership it was time for my first CUV. Did much research and was drawn to the class leaders, RAV4, CR-V, Outlander, Escape, Forester and Vue. In my opinion the Nissan Rogue trumps them all. Style - no spare hanging off the rear. Ride - firm yet compliant, smooth and comfortable. Engine - smooth as a baby's bottom. Power - more than enough for the job. Economy - averaging 23 mpg. Build quality - flawless. Interior - intuitive, understated luxury. If you believe that the whole can be greater than the sum of its parts than I urge you to test drive this vehicle before making a decision. This is the new king of the hill!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After test driving numerous cars and smaller SUVs, I kept coming back to the Rogue. It offers great features (not offered on other cars in its class), numerous safety features, and comfortable seats (unlike the Honda CR-V which I also had considered - the EX-L hurt my back like crazy after a 15 minute test drive). The Rogue has great fuel economy (for an AWD SUV), looks sleek, and drives so smooth! Its visibility compares to every other smaller SUV that I have ever driven. So, as a former sedan driver, visibility in my new Rogue seems just fine to me. I love it!</TEXT>

I opted not to get bluetooth+keyless, and it would have been worth the couple extra bucks a month, but that's my failing, not the Rogue's. So many people compliment me on it. It's made my hour-long commute in heavy LA traffic a real pleasure - I actually feel kind of sad every time I leave it in the garage overnight, but it's too big to sleep at the foot of the bed (and I think my dog would get jealous).

<TEXT>I've owned the Rogue for over a month and and am very happy so far. My choice was down to the Rogue vs. the new Honda CRV. While its hard to find anything wrong with the CRV, I was able to get the fully-loaded AWD Rogue for several thousand cheaper than a similar CRV. Also with Honda you have to add things like fog lights, compass mirror and roof rack after purchase, which is a hassle. This SUV is fun to drive, has good power and lots of cool features that come with the SL AWD. It takes a while to get used to the CVT and the engine is a bit noisy accelerating up hills, but otherwise smooth. The Bose sound system is a must - one of the cleanest sounds I've heard in a car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We replaced our 98 Subaru Outback with a 2008 Rogue. We were looking for better fuel mileage and another 4WD vehicle. After several months, we found the Rogue. Loved it from the get go. The only issues I would note are 1. Reflections of dash trim in the side mirrors, 2. no locking gas cap or door, 3. worried about paint issues around hatch hinges - sheet metal bends too easily 4. Tire Pressure Warning cannot be de-activated for winter tires on seperate wheels unless they are equipped with special valves. We have about 2500 miles on the car and we love it so far. </TEXT>

We looked at other crossovers, but have owned three Nissan Maximas with total satisfaction, so went with the Rogue. I had a PT Cruiser for five years and it was a nice little car, but I have to say this is much more enjoyable to drive. The front passenger seat on the PT Cruiser folded down and I found I used this feature all the time. The others like Rav4 didn't have this available.

<TEXT> After exhaustive internet research and several trips to the car dealers and several test drives, I (and my wife) decided that the Rogue simply offered the most bang for the buck. Some of the factors we took into consideration were fuel economy, safety features, trade-in value, and price. The Mariner was excluded because of price and no stability control. The RAV4 was nice but Toyota wouldn't really deal and I didn't like the spare on the outside. The CRV was the closest competitor with good quality and a nice feel. The Roque has plenty of power good fuel econ and high tech toys. This car fit our needs nicely. Easy to drive and park. Has a good quality feel. Traded in an 05 Pathfinder. </TEXT>

We have been true blue Toyota owners for years, but we were not impressed with the Rav 4. The Rogue won out in our thorough research of every possible choice on the market. It sits high enough to be above other cars, but is a comfortable step up into the car. We did get all the bells and whistles. Just had 5 inches of snow here in Ohio, and the AWD worked like a charm. Can't recommend it enough. Considering my wife wanted a Lexus, I pushed for the Rogue and she is liking it very much. Lucky for me.</TEXT>

The Bose stereo is awesome. The seats are comfortable and it is absolutely fun to drive. My boyfriend bought one 2 weeks later. My gas mileage is great at 22.8 city and 25.878 Hwy before break in. I like the bag storage in the way back to keep packages from shifting. Love the bluetooth! You gotta get one of these!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My very first car was a Porsche 944 and since then I've converted and driven nothing but Saabs...then we had a baby and it was time to be more practical. So we started our research and compared all of the different mid-sized SUVs out there in the <$30K price range. I was truly surprised when we finally test drove the Nissan Rogue. It had many of conveniences you'd find in a luxury car, the performance experience you'd want in a sports car, the fuel efficiency you'd expect from a compact car, the storage space you need in a SUV, and the safety features you'd demand in a family car. So we got one for my wife, and every day since I've beggged her to take the Saab so I can drive the Rogue!</TEXT>

<TEXT>As a former Corolla owner now working in northern NJ, I was looking for something with a little more power & able to handle the mountains, snow & rain. After driving 1500 miles, I have to give it high marks for steering and braking. That said the ride could be a little smoother. There is also noticeable road noise (wind) that seems to be coming from the hatch area as if it weren't sealed properly. Seating is very comfortable. I wasn't happy w/the factory black leather w/red dots so I opted for dealer installed black leather. IMO, it's much nicer. The Bose stereo is excellent. Nissan forces XM on you, so you will need to install an aftermkt Sirius radio thru the aux port. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Rogue gets high marks for exterior looks. It handles very well for a SUV. I drove mostly Corollas over the last 20yrs & I think the Rogue handles better than the Toyota. Whether it stands up to Toyota's reliablity will be another question that will tell over time. A good car w/a few problems.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Earlier in Dec '07, my ?05 Murano SE AWD was totaled. Due to money and fuel considerations, I didn?t want to replace it with a similar ?08 Murano, so I looked at RAV4s, CRVs, and Rogues. The Rogue won hands-down, mostly due to styling: it?s hard to go from a Murano to a RAV4. The Rogue is the best small crossover SUV for me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy move "down" from Murano to Rogue; CVT was familiar; 245hp to 170hp difference was not noticeable (due to less weight?). Ride is a blast. Love the paddle shifters. Also the intelligent key and heated leather seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought the rogue last week and I love it. Compared it with CR-V, RAV4 and CX-7, and am happy with the ride, comfort, handling, and engine (for a 4 banger). The CVT takes some getting used to, coming from someone who as a teenager had a firebird formula 400; but works well enough and getting 28 mpg on highway w/out the engine broken in. Bose stereo sounds boss, bluetooth through the stereo with steering wheel buttons is great! My wife loves the styling and the kids (actually 21 & 17) find the rear seat very comfortable, with plenty of room behind them for their junk!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove the Rav and the Cr-v before the rogue, no comparison! I got the wicked black with black cloth, and the premium package with moonroof. The smaller engine doesn't bother me because I want the better gas mileage. I traded in a 2005 Focus because I didn't want to spend another Colorado winter white knuckle driving! The 5-8 MPG difference is worth it!I have played in the snow with this and it is very solid on the ice/snow. I am so much more confident. Guess I'll save money this winter since I won't need as many massages for stressful driving!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my Mercury Cougar for a Rogue and couldn't be happier. I had my eye on the CR-V, but once the Rogue came out, I was sold. I purchased the SL 2WD w/2WD package, which includes all the little things a 25 year-old would want (illuminating visor mirrors, audio controls on the steering wheel, etc). The 2WD is perfect for Southern Calif. The back window is pretty small, but my old Cougar had a giant spoiler which blocked all views so I really can't complain. Overall, I absolutely love this car (as do my friends!) and I think Nissan did a fantastic job creating a sleek looking crossover that appeals to the masses.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After doing extensive research before I decided to purchase the Rogue, I found that the Rogue costs less, has more room, has a better engine, looks better, and has better fuel economy than other cars in its class such as the Honda CRV. After test driving both cars, it was very clear to me that the Rogue was much more superior than the CRV in almost every category you can think of. I am very happy with my purchase! </TEXT>

Well today, I am the owner of a 2008 Rogue, in blue with leather. So far so good. It is smaller, but for a 4cyl it has a lot of pep. Love the Bose radio and XM is a nice bonus.

<TEXT>I have had my Rogue for a little over a week now and what can I say. This vehicle is awesome! I drove all the other smaller sport utes that you can think of, the Rav 4, CRV, and Endeavor, and this one beats them all hands down. I have not noticed the issues with the blind spots when backing up but I was driving a quad cab Dodge Dakota before I got my Rogue. I just filled the tank up for the first time and although the onboard computer said I was getting 23.5 mpg, I actually got 25.2 mpg when you do the calculations. I did have about 60% of the miles on the highway. This is a fun vehicle to drive. It is very comfortable and quite on the highway with very little wind noise. </TEXT>

Good gas mileage. Quiet. Very nice style and design. Great features and great Bose stereo. Small turning radius. Very good driving position and seat comfort. Fast for a 4cyl. Big glove box.

<TEXT>The first thing to get used to is the CVT. Since there are no actual gears to run through, you do not realize your speed. The fit and finish is superbly Nissan. The driver's seat feels like a cockpit. The seat height is perfect to feel off the road and in command. Love the satellite radio. The bluetooth was the first thing we configured, then the homelink.

<TEXT>I don't usually complete reviews but had to share my Rogue experience. As a reluctant buyer after several "car payment free" years, I wanted all the latest safety features, great gas mileage, proven quality, AWD, and a sporty look. Nothing on the market was interesting me enough to warrant the payment. Then I saw the Rogue. Its Altima motor and Sentra platform, both rated above average, helped with the quality concerns with a new model (bought the ext warranty too). I browsed the online inventory of nearby Nissan dealers, chose a Rogue, took it for a drive, bought it and am loving every minute I drive it - it's great! Online prep makes dealer part go much smoother and more quickly!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD & VDC is amazing on wet roads - should be as good on snow, stability is solid on interstates with trailer trucks flying by, the CVT downshifts automatically on hills to slow down or give that extra assist up, cabin is roomy and comfortable and has sporty look inside to match the sharp exterior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this car for approximately three weeks. Getting used to the CVT transmission took some time, and you have to learn how to "drive" all over again, or your RPMs will constantly be above 3K. The interior is well put together, but I don't understand what the excitement over the Bose sound system is - it's OK, but nothing magical. The front seats are comfortable, but it would be nice if the steering wheel telescoped. The shift paddles are nice, but I don't see a need for them with the CVT - if you drive the car right, it knows what to do. The red radio display tends to wash away in bright light. Overall, a nice vehicle that I would buy again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, a very good crossover. Has plenty of power, good seats, and feels substantial. Getting used to the CVT takes some time... to avoid the RPM's going to 3-4K, you have to learn how to accelerate correctly. HUGE blind spots in the back due to the small windows, but the side mirrors are large and seem to help with the blind spots. Keyless start is very nice, along with the Bose audio system & satellite radio. There seems to be a lot of noise in the cabin when accelerating.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my 08 Rogue SL for 6 months and I can honestly say "I'm in love with my Rogue." I've had a RAV and a Tribute. They can't compare to my Rogue. I picked the Blue and of course had to get the Bluetooth package with Bose and Xenon Headlights. Everyone that sees it loves it. I wouldn't give up my CVT for the world. Do not miss that archaic gear shift feel from the old days. I had an 07 Altima with the same 2.5 and CVT and glad that my Rogue came with the same. I average 25.8 mpg and couldn't be happier. I was averaging 31 mpg in the Altima, but I traded the slight difference in economy for utility. Fair trade off. It's great in the snow, on the highway and even around town.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am sorry to say, Our family looked for a crossover vehicle for a while then we found the Rogue the gas mileage was the selling point along with the looks and supposedly the reliability(Not So!) We owned the vehile less than a year traded the vehicle at 16,000 at this time we had already had two transmissions and was in need of the third NO one could explain if there would ever be a fix. I was concerned for the safety of my family so I tried working with the dealer and with Nissan all you get is political answers no one wanted to take the blame for selling a vehicle that did not perform to the standards that the dealer sold it at or would Nissan communicate there concern of there customer</TEXT>

<TEXT>I loved my new Rogue the second I sat in it at the dealer. I was originally looking to buy a Murano and on the way out of the show room I walked by the brand new just released two weeks ago, Rogue. Blew my socks off. The gas mileage is unbelievable. I get 25.6 mpg in the city. I get well over 30 mpg on the highway. The paddle shifters on the steering wheel are very different and fun. The pep this car has for a 4 cylinder is just incredible. The CVT offers such a smooth ride that I forget how fast I am going sometimes because I am so used to a car shifting. I highly recommend at least test driving one for yourself. </TEXT>

Beautiful interior, great performance on road and VERY fun on dirt roads with AWD I recommend the leather with red stitching, beautiful. I get lots of compliments on the sound of the exhaust. The paddle shifters are fun but you don't "need" them for fun. Lots of head and leg room compliments from passengers. Corners great. Accelerates better than many V6s on the road with me. Kinda hard to see out the rear, but it's small so you can use the mirrors typically, very few blind spots. Love the in-floor cargo box and HUGE glove box. Probably the largest on any vehicle. Love the stylish gauges and audio.</TEXT>

I love all of the spacial features, nooks and pockets galore. I will say the CVT takes a bit of getting used to. I instinctively tune into the engine and I know when my car goes to the next gear, but in this car there's no pause or shift to the next gear. It's really cool, just unusual. The stability bars in the front and rear give excellent cornering and turning abilities. </TEXT>

It handles great, very comfortable (I am 6'-2"), and quiet inside. I got the AWD in wicked black with no other options. It meets all my needs, except for one that I need to wait for - a Class 3 tow hitch with the 2" receiver for my hitch-mounted bike rack. It's a little smaller than the Xterra but I won't miss it and I certainly won't miss the poor gas mileage of the Xterra.

We got out of a Mazda 6s and the ride feels better, the mileage is just as good, and the style is truly astonishing. We are getting compliments everywhere we go with the Rogue. The only qualm I have is the power, I would like to have more horses, but I am very happy with what I have now. If you are trying to look for a great crossover with plenty to offer at a great price, look no further.

Even the back seats are somewhat form fitted to your body! The leg room is unbelievable. We fit 2 booster seats and a carseat in the back. The cargo area is very large, with hidden compartments. There was ample room for 2 bales of hay for our Halloween display. The ride is smooth and with the CVT, you cant feel the car shift at all. Its a very quiet ride too. I would definitely recommend to everyone.</TEXT>

It was also priced right. I love everything about the car.

When I went to pick it up in the showroom, there was a crowd of people surrounding it. It is a show stopper! My favorite thing with this car is the bluetooth integration. I love being able to make calls from the car thru voice activation. It has never confused a command I speak or get a number wrong when I speak to it. The leather interior is flawless. You have as much leg room in the back seat as the front. I also love the fact that the glove box is big enough for a laptop if you so wish. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was very pleased with the reponsiveness of the Rogue on the road. It drives more like a sedan than a typical SUV and is far more comfortable to drive or ride in than our Honda CRV. Road noise has not been a problem, and I think we're getting about 27mpg highway, which is as advertised.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SL model is nicely appointed. I think it has more acceleration than CRV or RAV4, and is a comfortable car to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having waited for this car since Jan., it would be easy to be disappointed. This vehicle is perfect for my wife and me: a comfortable people mover with bucket seats that have very good support, great road manners with AWD and Vehicle Dynamic Control working full time on every curve and turn, and just enough pep to do western PA hills, flexibility in hauling everything from 18 grocery bags to 12 boxes. Wash a car once and you learn a lot. Not only is the Venon (pearl) Red paint luxurious, but the application is perfect. This complements the fit of the doors that have rubber weather strips to seal out water and dirt protecting the rocker panels.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Intelligent Key system makes the Premium package premium. Then there is that Bose radio option that really punctuates the music. Thank goodness the Bluetooth phone system interrupts the music to announce a phone call that I may have missed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great small SUV. It handles excellent. It has also very nice packages such as leather and awd premiuim package. I test drove it and felt in love and I bought immediately. But I test drove many other cars before this. And this is much better choice than even best selling CRV. You must test drive it. Words cannot do enough justice.It is very luxurious car at very affordable price.You could fill the car's tank around $40. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought Rogue SL 2WD with the premium package last weekend. Have driven about 600 miles so far. The crossover is really fun to drive, handling is superb, very quiet even at 80 MPH on highway. The exterior design is very nice and refreshing, I think Nissan designers have done a great job. It has much better outside appeal then Rav4/Honda CRV. The interior is very well laid out. The second row is comfortable for this size of the vehicle. Has MP3/aux input as standard - what else! The gas mileage on the highway so far has been in 27 and change range, right on mark what shows on the sticker. So far no complaints. Fun vehicle to own.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked at numerous vehicles for a year, hands down the best, sporty yet stable handling, carlike smooth ride, seats fit me perfectly, very comfortable leather, good thigh support, head room just enough, am 6 feet tall, bountiful leg room, actually have seat forward with plenty of leg room in rear. Went shopping and had plenty of cargo room. Dash very smart, simple and sporty, all gauges easily readable, acceleration more than ample, car feels like going slow at 65 mph, tried paddle shifters, fun but not necessary, grey with grey interior, beautiful and classy, wife so happy with car, never saw her like this with a new car, she loves the look, the feel, the comfort. Nissan has a winner here.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I took delivery of my Rogue last Saturday and took it on its first road trip (340 mi.) the next day. I love it!!! I had leather seat covers put in my SL and I couldn't be happier with the way it looks. It's so comfortable to drive. All my previous cars have been 2 door, this is my first 4 door car and it's awesome! I can't believe I drove all these years and raised 2 sons with 2 door cars all this time. I purchased the indigo blue color and it's just beautiful. This is just a happy little SUV and I'm very pleased with it so far. I've only had it a week.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far not too many issues with this car. The car was a great price for what you get. The mileage is a bit less than expected. We live in a place some would call "off the beaten path" so I do have one major issue. The CVT is NOT designed for mud, snow or mountain driving. This is the first car I've owned with the CVT and will be the last. A belt drive should be left for flatlanders, ATVs and snowmobiles. When you try to back over a small snowbank or rut you must gun it or you will burn the belt. This type of transmission requires some momentum to properly engage and that is not always an option.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's a nice vehicle but here are the bad things. Heat takes about 10 minutes til you can turn it on, anytime you turn on the climate controls it defaults to air conditioning (the most annoying feature). If you have the Bo speaker system, your subwoofer is mounted on top of the spare tire, so be prepared to take that off when you are broken down on the side of the road. Other then that I like everything else on the car, I know one review said it doesn't have fog lights but mine does, took me awhile to find them. Headlights are also adjustable if they look dim. Upgraded sound system sounds awesome, and it has XM radio! Dealer, Salesman and bestbuy guy that installed my XM all didn't know it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Nice looking & comfortable riding car in general. However, had lots of problems with indicator lights, air bag warning system, within the first few months of owning the car. Had to bring it back to the dealer for repairs many times. Also going through my first winter in MA with the car and already in two months had several near accidents and then recently skidded into a guard rail while only driving 25 mph. The tires are inferior with VERY POOR performance. Warning... check your tires and be very careful driving with them.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been driving my Rogue for 3 wks. now. It has a comfortable ride, but the int. ergonomics are terrible. I believe it must have been designed for someone with the arm length of a veloco-raptor. The window switches are set back about 4 inches too far. The center armrest is also back too far. The cup holders are too close together and are also set back a bit far. The side mirrors are nice and large. This is good because the rear window is the same size as the rear view mirror. Performance wise, it is not bad. Smooth ride, with OK pickup for a 4 cyl. engine. It does have an unusual resonance when at 40 MPH. Must be the CVT trying to find a sweet spot. MPG is between 21-23.5</TEXT>

<TEXT>I reviewed the CRV, RAV4 and Rogue. I owned a Honda for 10 yrs, my husband likes Toyota.I talked to people with Nissan's and got good feedback. I LOVE my Rogue! I get 24.6 mpg. I love the heated seats. It is easy to maneuver in parking spaces and has great pick up on the highway. I tend to drive fast (75-80) and it doesn't shake or hesitate at that speed, runs smooth and relatively quiet. The Bose sound system is awesome. The only negative I have about the Rogue is the rear visibility. It's hard to see when backing up. The slant on the rear window, plus it's small size makes it hard to see behind you. I'm getting used to using the side mirrors. I recommend the Rogue!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I saw the Rogue on my way home from work and I knew that was the vehicle I wanted. I had my previous car for 12 years, through two or three transmission, two car accidents (one not my fault). My husband kept asking me to please buy a new car, but I couldn't because I didn't see one I wanted to buy, until I saw the Rogue through the glass window of the bus I was riding home on. It's quick, fun and easy to drive, but doesn't feel like a big bulky SUV at all. The only problem I had was finding a comfortable seat position. If I sat too close to the steering wheel, I felt cramped. If I sat too far away, I couldn't reach the peddles. I finally found a good position. I love my Rogue.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted to wait a bit before writing a review to see how well the Rogue held up. I bought it in February 2008 and it now has about 18,000 miles on it. I'm very pleased to report that I have not had to return it to the dealer for any reason. I was a little nervous purchasing a 4 cylinder, but the Rogue's CVT has performed very well and I'm quite comfortable pulling into traffic, even with the A/C on. The Rogue is remarkably quiet cruising on a high speed interstate. I've been pleased with the gas mileage and it has improved about 2 mpg overall since it was new. My driving is a mix of highway, city and county roads (45mph). I seem to get about 26 mpg doing that and 29 all highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the best car I have ever owned. Previously I drove a 2000 Honda Civic. And Rogue just blew me away, and I did compare it to Rav4 and Honda CRV. It is comfortable to drive for long distance trips. Its acceleration is great. Internal compartments are well thought out: large glove compartment, deep driver's box, upper compartment, etc. It has the amenities of a luxury car (well, almost). Trip calculator, mp3 port, front and back windshield heater, etc. Mileage, however, is not great for city drive. But with cheap gas prices now, I only spend $26 (it was $55) every 220 miles. For long trips, I could get 330 miles</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased this car (base S version without any options) 2 days ago, love it so far. Much bigger than expected, good road performance with the CVT, it just takes some time getting used to the no shifting thing, lock out the OD in hilly sections and enjoy the ride. While more features would be nice the cost of the car was quite reasonable for the quality. I needed a new commuter car because my 1999 subaru forester with 140K miles was about to die and the new forester seemed very cheap feeling, tried the crv (great car) but it all came down to price. While not looking forward to the first real snow it will be interesting to experience the worst nj can throw at this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in 2001 Mazda Tribute V6 gas hog & purchased a new Rogue, loaded. To date, it's been really good (2,800 mi). CVT is smooth & responsive. Interior is quiet, comfortable and a great layout. Leather seats are extremely comfortable. Engine is responsive & plenty quick for highway access. We tested many vehicles & for us, found the Rogue to be the best all around choice. A lot more room for people but a little less storage space, which is perfect 'cause 85% of the time we carry people... but still had no problem loading a boxed 46 in. TV! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I found the interior ergonomics of this vehicle to be quite annoying. The window\doorlock switches on the door armrest sits a few inches too far back and cannot be operated without lifting your arm off of the door rest and reaching back. The side view mirror adjustment switch is literally under the dashboard and requires you to lean forward to operate. The lever to slide the seat forward and back is too far down and recessed. Visibility out of the rear window is worse than most because the window is smaller, slanted, and the rear of the vehicle is higher than driver's position. Cargo room is smaller than RAV4 or Outlander. I have owned other Nissans and loved them, but not the Rogue.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I dumped a 2004 Audi A4 that had given me constant trouble. I still wanted something fun to drive that got great gas mileage but not so pricey or high maintenance. Did a lot of research and chose the Rogue. I drive 18-20k miles a year and need something reliable and comfortable. Having owned a Camry, Maxima and A4, this my favorite. Excellent gas mileage (25-31 mpg), fun to drive, comfortable, and looks great. I was concerned about the CVT after constant problems with the Audi CVT but so far it has been fine. For a small SUV it's unbelievable how much it holds. I tailgate at football games and am able to fit the whole setup, luggage, and 3 passengers comfortably on 6 hour road trips. Love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had vehicle about 2 months and satisfied. Was concerned about the CVT but so far no problem. Drove up to Yellowstone and back and got an amazing 34 mpg. Usually get about 26-27 driving around our local area. Paid between 25 and 26K for a loaded awd SL. Leather, Bose, sunroof, Intellikey etc. Very comfortable and large enough to do the job but small enough to be fuel efficient. We have a 3/4 ton 4WD suburban also but it only gets about 13-14 mpg so it sits in the back yard most of the time now. I have been a Honda liker and tried the CRV. Did not like the way the CRV handled, it seemed rather squirrelly to me at highway speeds whereas the Rogue runs straight and true. </TEXT>

<TEXT>What a great crossover. We have had the Rogue for 4 months now, and it has performed admirable. The wife wanted a small SUV with all the bells and whistles. After researching the costs of the competition, test drives, etc, we choose the Rogue. It's fun to drive, slightly under powered when combined with the CVT, but we knew that going in and improved gas mileage was a much higher priority than sports car acceleration. If I really want to drive it hard, I just slip it into manual mode and use the steering wheel paddle shifters. Very cool option. Gas mileage has been great with 25 in the city and 33 hiway. Very well made car and look forward to years of driving this one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I hadn't had a new car in 8 years and was replacing a 2000 Impala. The alloy orange color won me over and I wasn't happy until I had one. I'm not thrilled with the black interior as it seems to always look dirty. Medium colors hide the dirt better. I was hearing a 'gurgle' sound and stopped in to have it checked out at the dealership. I was more than surprised to find out that the CVT has to be replaced as it is slipping. Not something you want to hear with only 4000 miles on the vehicle. I took the car on a 700 miles trip (one way) last weekend and was thrilled with the long term comfort of the vehicle. I do wish it had automatic lights. Overall a great car</TEXT>

I read each and every review before purchasing and so far have not had one negative to think or say about the Rogue. The vehicle is so quiet on the inside that the Bose sound system is a true pleasure to listen to! Acceleration on the interstate was very very responsive, for a 4 cyl amazing! We averaged 27.5 MPG for both trips and find our around town MPG not much less. Bottom line if you are a big man and worried about the size of this small SUV, don't be, get in, and just do it, fun to drive - very fun!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is quick for a 4 cylinder! We took it out on a test drive and by the time we merged with traffic we had hit 80. It is smooth riding, roomy, none of that shift surge you get with geared car, in fact the "pro" reviewer said he could hear the engine rev up, and be noisy; when you accelerated. We heard none of that. No run up in RPM. This vehicle is a pleasure to drive. The car is for my wife. She had an expedition with an 8 cylinder and she was afraid the Rogue was going to be underpowered. NO WAY, she was a happy camper after the test drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This was a great buy. I am very impressed with its great mpg. I get about 23-25 mpg in the city and about 29-30 mpg on the highway. I am also impressed with its acceleration. I have no problem passing on the highway. I really enjoy the CVT. It is smooth and very nice. The interior is very nice and functional.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted a vehicle that was under $30k and gas mileage of 25 mpg+. Checked the Saturn Vue, Honda CRV, Toyota Rav4 and Ford Edge. All nice cars. But the Rogue's design won me over. It's very sporty and I get a lot of compliments. The CVT is smooth. I do worry about the transmission problems I've read other people are having. The black leather seating is luxurious. I have averaged 26.3 mpg for 5 fill ups so far. I'm 6'2 and have plenty of room. I wish it had a telescoping steering wheel so I don't have to stretch my arms out all the time. I have driven a suv for 14 yrs and the Rogue is the quietest vehicle I have been in by far. I can't hear the engine. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather package, heated seats, heated mirrors, xm radio and I just love the voice activated bluetooth. Just touch a button on the steering wheel and you're talking. Very good gas mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I looked and looked for the right car to replace my 98 Honda Odyssey (all done w/babies and toddlers, yea!). Started wanting a wagon, but ended up in the crossover market. I'm so happy with my choice, and I can't believe how well it's fitting into our lives. It's actually more roomy in the front than our van. The kids are super comfortable in the back seats and don't seem to miss the reclining feature at all. I find plenty of room in the cargo area, and am figuring out how to rack it up to be able to carry bikes, skis, etc. Love the black/red cloth interior, it's kind of retro and very cool. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Rogue for 2 months so far with no problems. I bought a locking gas cap. Some have mentioned the limited vis- ability when backing up, but I like this as it gives me more privacy when driving. When backing up I just raise myself up in the seat to see better. So far all is great including gas mileage. I traded in a Toyota Rav4 for the Rogue and am very happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked/drove many cars bfore this purchase - Forester, Matrix, Patriot, Compass, etc. I was so impressed with the Rogue. The fit, finish & interior is excellent. There is more driver room than my wife's Sienna. I was impressed with the mpg, standard airbags, vsc, and room. It drives smoothly, handles well in turns, and the front seats are very comfortable. Critics claim the cargo area is too small. I find it adequate. The Orange color gets much attention and looks great. I didn't get leather (first time ever) and am happy with the cloth. This product feels substantial and refined. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We love this car. The clearance and fuel economy were the deciding factors for buying it. We live on a farm and have experienced in the seven months that we've owned it: two separate mouse nests in the heater fan, dirt and ice build up in the wheels and grinding noise from the front end (which is now on going). We didn't have problems like this with the Oldsmobile we used as a trade in. We also added a spoiler to reduce the dust and snow build- up on the back window, but it didn't do that. The spoiler did help the fuel economy somewhat though. We are getting the stated fuel economy and it is fun to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased this vehicle in Jan after searching for many months. Had a 6 cyl Ford Windstar minivan, and wanted SUV style w/o the high cost and poor gas milage. After 3300 miles, like other reviewers began hearing rattling noice in driver front side, as well as hesitation when accelerating. Brought back in at 8500 miles, and was told need new transmission! They have had to replace others. I just got the car back 3 days ago, and it STILL hesitates, however rattling is gone, for now. Loved this car, however not sure if it's going to last me many more years. Don't roll down the 2 back windows, as air pressure/noise is terrible.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Finally. We have a crossover that is all car in terms of comfort and luxury design. And yet tall and visible like an SUV. The Rogue has an impressive road presence that I really enjoy. It certainly isn't as tall as the Xterra I turned in. But it impresses me in every category. For an i4 this car is very torquey but you will want the manual shift... otherwise it is slow to respond. The leather is beautiful. Bose system is a typical Bose system :). I should have gotten a moonroof. The car whips around turns and turns heads. It feels slow but it is because of the great suspension. You're actually outrunning all those people around you. Buy a Rogue!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Nissan Rogue SUV AWD, totally fit out with all the luxury package items about 4 weeks ago. So far, I like the following aspects: cool design, engine power, radio/Bose speakers/satellite, cargo room, ease of use. I think the car rides a little harshly and jiggles and jumps too easily in response to bumps. It should have a memory seat feature also. However, it does satisfy my wish for a car/SUV that is sports, gets > 20 mpg in city driving, has cargo room, and lots of amenities. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Rogue on 7/12, trading an '01 Toyota RAV4. After doing a lot of research (via Edmunds), and test-driving a few other vehicles (Jeep Liberty, Ford Escape, Hyundai Tucson), I tried out the Rogue. I was sold! The ride is incredibly smooth, seems like a much larger, more expensive sedan. To echo another WV owner, it has plenty of power to get me where I need to go in our Mountain State! I'm on the first tank of gas that I've purchased; mileage is looking good! I would like to see a locking fuel door, however.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I loved my new Nissan Rogue until the other day when the back side glass shattered into a million pieces without any apparent reason. I had been home only a few minutes when I noticed the glass had shattered. It seemed to have imploded due to the heat and air conditioning combined. The dealership would not accept the fact that it could have been their workmanship or defect in the glass. The glass went into the seat cover about 2 inches deep and would have severely injured a person sitting in that seat. Luckily, the car had just been parked and no one was inside. Glass was thrown throughout the car. No sign of damage due to vandalism or otherwise. Be careful!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my fourth Nissan vehicle. I previously owned an Altima 3.5 v6 and loved the drive. I wanted better gas mileage, AWD and an overall vehicle style change. I loved the look of the Rogue and although I was not sure about the power (2.5) I could not resist the overall interior and exterior quality and extras that were offered. I purchased the Rogue SL AWD leather package and absolutely LOVE the drive. The pickup is smooth and responsive and surprisingly I do not miss the V6 at all! Gas mileage is great for my lengthy commute, not to mention satellite radio to make my ride that much enjoyable. My husband finds the vehicle roomy, and there's plenty of space in the back for my 2yr old toddler</TEXT>

<TEXT> I have to admit, the Rogue is probably one of the funniest cars to drive on the road today. It handles well around turns, in snow, and with crosswinds. With it's great stability, I don't worry about tipping over. I cannot emphasize how well it does on gas mileage in this day of high gas prices. The Bose system (premium pkg) is well worth the extra price. It is comfortable on long drives and a joy to have and own. I can't wait to drive it every day.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gotta be the Bose stereo system and steering wheel console for the radio and bluetooth hands-free. It's easy to hook up, you can change the presets, volume, answer a call without taking your eyes from the road. A MUST HAVE for those looking to purchase.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned 4 mini-vans over the past 17 years which I liked a lot. They served the family well for trips, hauling stuff, etc. I wanted a sporty, fun-to-drive car that handled well, had some zip, was sharp looking, but could also carry a load if need be. My Rogue is it! The 4-cylinder engine has plenty of power and is surprisingly quiet. The ride is a tad stiff, but the steering is tight and seats very comfortable. Took it on a 1200 mile trip and didn't get sore bottoms. With the back seats folded down, it can hold a lot. It lets you sit up (like a van), but drives like a sports car. Love the CVT - avoids constant downshifting. Takes getting used to. Been getting 26-27 mpg. Fun.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I want to get the message out to all those considering buying a Rogue..DON'T DO IT!! There are countless people out there myself included who after 3000 miles are having major transmission problems. Nissan is aware of the issue but cannot fix it. They know its in the transmission but they don't know what it is. They've replaced transmissions just to have the car come back. If you have one, what you will hear is a rattling noise when slowing down < 10 MPH. After a while it will start doing it at all speeds as mine is.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got this Rogue on Dec 1st, as a company vehicle. I drive on many rural roads as a sales rep, so needed good clearance & the AWD is great. I was used to V6 engines, so it took a bit to get used to the 4 cylinder. I think the CVT is great. I average about 25-26 MPG, when driving normally. If I really drive it hard (80 MPH) on the interstate, mileage drops to 22-23. I like everything about it except the visibility out the rear window. I guess that's why they put mirrors on vehicles. The wheel design on the SL model seems to hold snow & mud that freezes in the winter causing vibrations like the wheels are out of balance as well. Not a problem now that summer is here.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded my wife's 2007 Maxima se on a Rogue. Reason was the ability to use regular fuel. I had hoped to get better fuel mileage but didn't really believe that I would. The Rogue is a nice little vehicle. My wife misses the power and handling of the Maxima but she likes the Rogue. She has 5,000 miles on it already, and has averaged 26.4 mpg. Not bad. She likes the bluetooth and I like the Bose. The CVT takes getting used to. When we bought the 2007 Maxima I thought that I would never get to like the transmission. But after a while it grew on us (we put 48,000 miles on the Maxima) the rogue could use a locking gas door in these times, and a way to open the hatch from the drivers seat.

I was worried about downsizing to a 4 cyl from a 6, but the Rogue has more than enough power. The CVT provides smooth acceleration and the suspension makes the Rogue's ride car-like and way smoother than my Escape. The sporty-sleek exterior styling made several neighbors stop over to check out this Nissan. I am getting over 26 MPG with 70% of my already 900+ mi coming from Chicago toll-ways (most are under construction). </TEXT>

I'm 5'11(with most of that being legs) and for once my knees aren't up to my chin while riding. Love the exterior and CVT. I really think I got the best deal for my buck and wouldn't trade my Rogue for anything! Except for maybe a new Rogue.</TEXT>

Road noise also. Rogue much better in crosswinds. 2) RAV accelerates faster, both from standing start and highway pass, but Rogue isn't at all lazy. 3) MPG on Rogue is better. 33 avg on first three tanks in Rogue vs 27 in 30k miles in RAV. 4) Rogue seats more comfortable, more supportive on sides and lumbar areas.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've driven 986 miles and car performed exceptionally well. CVT gives very smooth and comfortable ride, especially at traffic jams, "stop and go". Brakes are excellent. Seats are comfortable, dash is elegant looking. This is SL AWD version with all the possible options except leather seats. The combination of the utility, AWD, fuel economy, outlooking, overall quality and smart design were the selling points for me. I'm getting 30 mpg with a/c on on most of the time during a trip to Pennsylvania during long Memorial weekend. Today I just found I had 23.8 mpg on my second tank of gas with mixed heavy local traffic and highway driving. Excellent crossover, excellent.</TEXT>
