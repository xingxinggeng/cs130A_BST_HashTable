<TEXT>The somewhat leisurely acceleration is expected and can be circumvented by flogging the engine in manual mode using the paddle shifters. Initial fuel economy was disappointing, but rapidly improved after putting "Sea-Foam" fuel system cleaner in the tank. Am now getting 38.5 mpg in city driving. The local Smart dealership was very friendly and reprogrammed the transmission to largely eliminate the 1-2 shift lag in my 2008 as part of a no-charge update to 2009 standards. This made a huge improvement in driveability! Highway stability in cross-winds is somewhat squirrely, but I had no trouble keeping it in the lane even when x-winds topped 35 mph on a fast causeway. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very roomy inside for a tiny two-seater. Getting in and out is wonderfully easy. I'm over 6'-2" and can wear a tall hat in this car! All the features are useful and contribute to the feel of having a much more expensive car. Love the 10,000 service interval. People smile and wave. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I continue to read reviews with people complaining about the transmission! My wife and I each have a fortwo. Last month we drove it 2700 miles from seattle to Spearfish SD.It was terrific in the mountains.The paddle shifters work like a dream. We left our Cadillac at home and drove the smart car. If people will take the time to learn to shift the car it is the best transmission on the road today. We have been in the auto parts business for over 40 years and have had many different vehicles, but these are amazing. I have 15,000 miles on mine and it runs just like the day I bought it! The roominess inside continues to surprise people. More headroom than my cadillac.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Transmission with paddles, heated seats and of course my 45 miles to a gallon. I drive 15 miles each way to work and the stability at 70 mph is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned this car for 9 months. I cant wait too get rid of it!!!! Yeah it's cute but it isn't all that it's made out too be. The gas mileage is good only if you drive like an old person, A car this small should get better MPG. The transmission is the worst, annoying, uncomfortable feeling I have ever exp, even with the trans software update. It is soooo annoying if you get stuck in traffic, Shifting from 1st to 2nd constantly up and down will make you want to vomit. This is the main reason I want too sell it. Gas gauge still wont read rt, even after 5 times back too the dealer, Mercedes should be ashamed to hsve there name linked too this car. THE LITTLE HERKY JERKY ROLLERCOASTER RIDE..</TEXT>

<TEXT>After one year of ownership, I find I still look forward to my driving time in the smart fortwo. The car has peppy performance, and is quite comfortable, even on the long road trips. I find that I can accomplish 99% of my driving and cargo tasks with this excellent car. Initially, I had several of the "smart car gremlins" occur, but the dealership has performed admirably with all warranty work. Here in the desert, the climate can be extreme: the smart fortwo handles the cold, searing heat, wind, torrential rain, uv extreme sunlight, snow and ice very well indeed. I am looking forward to an all- electric smart in my future.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a college student who wanted an inexpensive car to get to and from school. This car is so fun to drive, especially with the top rolled down. It gets many stares and many questions. I love everything about it! Obviously this car isn't for everyone. Some people need trucks for work, but for many people like me, this two-seater is perfect. It holds everything I need for my classes and squeezes into tight places when I'm on the hunt for parking. My family owns a Mini Cooper S, and although it leaves the Smart in the dust performance wise, the Smart, for me anyway, is much more entertaining to drive due to it's unique character. Don't expect to be an Indy 500 racer in this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice and roomy. 40mpg city if you behave. Surprising amount of storage space. Tons of upgradable features like storage nets/boxes/cruise control. Plastic, interchangeable body panels are so cool! New colors each season? This car makes people smile; it's a very unique experience to own one in Texas!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car. Even though there is a jerky shift between 1st & 2nd gears, it's not that bad. The gas mileage has been great (38-45 mph). Most of my driving is around town but I have traveled on the highway. The space inside is surprisingly roomy. My husband and I are both tall and I have to pull the seat forward. The convertible allows you to fold partially or totally down. I like that feature. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive 8 miles to work and around town generally but have made long distance trips on the freeway and found it no different than my large volvo as far as feeling secure in the driving experience. For a 4 cylinder it has a lot of pick up. I tend to put the pedal to the metal and I am not disappointed in its take off from a stop at intersections. Of course, my driving style does mean that my fuel economy is not as good as what is advertised. I get about 30 to 32 in town but 40 on the freeway over long distances.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are its uniqueness and roomy interior. When friends ride with me they are surprised by the comfort and get up and go. I am getting a little tired of constantly being stopped to talk about my car but am getting used to being stared at as I drive down the street.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Unlike shopping for other vehicles, in choosing a smart, you decide on what you don't need. Do you need to chauffeur people? Do you need to buy fuel frequently? Do you need to spend time looking for a parking spot? Do you need zippy acceleration? Do you need trunk space that will hold more than a suitcase or two? If you answered, "No," to one or more questions, then the smart deserves consideration. Yes, the ride can be poor to fair, but the very comfortable seats make up for a lot. Yes, the transmission doesn't shift that smoothly, but it can be described kindly as "easy going." It's okay in the city, and on the highway, once you're up to speed, does it really matter? I love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love it's tiny footprint- great for the city. It's turning circle is almost a ring size. The visibility, except to the rear with the top all the way down, is superb. The seats are firm and comfortable. Getting 38 mpg is fine, thank you. Getting in and out, particularly in parking lots.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>WITH A PASSION</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Got my car in April, 2008. The craziness of being chased down by tow truck drivers and 20 people standing around my car in the grocery store parking lot has gone away. But still have the occasional "how do you like your little car?" at the gas pump. Happy to say, almost a year later and I am still in love with my eco- friendly, economical import. In town, I get 33-42mpg depending on how I'm driving but even when gas was $4.00 a gallon, never spent a whole $20 to fill up. Big inside, very SMART outside.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage, easy to keep clean, fun to drive, easy to park and it is adorable with reindeer antlers and nose during Christmas, also love the sunroof that is standard</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is one of the best cars I have ever owned! I am getting 40 to 45 MPG going back and forth to work which is part city and part highway driving. On the highway I am getting 45 to 50 MPG. So the actual mileage if you drive it moderately in automatic mode is much better than the EPA estimates. The car does not feel as small as it is. Very comfortable in all types of weather. Heater and A/C work great. In fact it heats up and cools down much better than regular size cars because there isn't much space to heat and cool! Will easily run 90 MPH on the highway and very smooth and stable at that speed. Handles very good around corners also. Very agile in city traffic. Like driving a go-kart!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the removable plastic body panels. Tridion safety cell and all the safety features which are standard like the ABS brakes, the Stability Control, frontal and side airbags, traction control,electronic force distribution,tire pressure monitors,acceleration skid control (like positraction).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Come on! People are comparing this car to a restored 85 civic for fuel economy. It may be true that the civic gets better mileage but how much fun is a 1985 civic to drive? I first saw this car in Italy and could not wait to get one. I have seen, studied, drove and read all the available info. This car is designed well and is fun! Sure, it could use better gas mileage, a smoother transmission and longer warranty , but what car is absolutely perfect at this price level? As stated: "The smile factor" is what makes this car a pleasure to own. This will be a second runabout vehicle for me in the city. Can't wait to get mine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the most pleasing car I have ever owned. I am 6'3" and the smart may be small outside, but is big inside. It is very comfortable and easy to enter and exit because of the large doors and high seating position. Drive a car with manual transmission before driving the smart, and then you will appreciate the auto-shifting transmission. The performance is excellent considering the great fuel economy. I drive mostly at 60 to 70 mph and average over 40 mpg. Mileage improves and the transmission shifts smoother after the car is broken in. The car could get better mileage if it didn't have all the comfort features and was lower profile. This car is definitely worth waiting for. It's a blast.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very fun to drive, thrifty, excellent conversation item.The ride is a bit choppy and slow, and the transmission is fickle.I always look forward to driving it, and I consistently get 40mpg.It runs fine in 89 octane MIDGRADE, spiked with 5-10$ of 92 octane premium per tankful. Defective radio, changed under warranty within 5 min. by the dealer. The gas gauge has been a bit whimsical, but worked its own bugs out (healed itself). Catalytic converter hot air pump failed: another 5 min. stop at the dealer for a replacement. The driver's side mirror fuzzes a bit. The starter lock has a personality. Tinny speakers too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After waiting almost 12 months (current wait 18 mos.), we picked up our smart ForTwo Passion coupe a couple days ago. With gas prices of $3.55 per gallon here it couldn't have come in at a better time. So far we're very happy with it. It's everything we expected and more. First impressions: - Surprisingly roomy. Very comfortable. Great seats. I'd drive it on a 500 mile trip. - Somewhat choppy ride due to the short wheelbase, but not too choppy. - Stable and sure-footed, even at 75 alongside 18 wheelers, but you can tell that it weights 1800 lbs. - Transmission and shifting is "different" and requires some getting used to and some new skills but it's fun</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wrote this review after reading Karl on Cars' evaluation. He complained about the lack of a standard tach, no armrest, and the transmission. If you drive it in the city like you're supposed to, you won't need a tach if you leave it in auto mode. But the $120 I spent for one wasn't too bad. I don't miss the armrest because the Saabs I learned to drive on never had one. And after 2000 miles I've learned to drive it without the transmission lurching. Once you get used to it, it's an impressively fun car for around town and driving by yourself. It's got its faults, but I never drive it without a smile on my face. The naysayers just don't get it. Too bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It just makes you laugh at yourself. What a pleasant feeling. I live in a town where my immediate neighbors drive Bentleys, Mercedes, Porsches and Ford GTs (and one old Ferrari). BMW's and Audis are banned because they stink of the middle class, (but I did see a democrat once driving a Saab before they ran her out of town). And yet I must get more waves, thumbs-up and smiles from the Cougars (35-40- something divorcees) than when I drove my v12 Benz convertible. Too funny. This thing drives like a go cart, feels remarkably stable, sips fuel, makes me feel like I am at least trying to save our planet (all the body panels are recycled milk bottles). </TEXT>

<TEXT>Comfort, fun to drive and all the elements under the Design heading, I would really give an '11'!!! This car is really well thought out and well put together. Plenty of power to get onto highways and keep up with normal traffic at whatever speed. I have had a very new experience with it...buying a new car and after one month nothing broken or any mechanical failures. Once I got used to the 'manual' transmission, it is kinda fun to drive whether in auto-mode or paddle shifters or stick. I'm not really a convertible guy, but I'm having a super great time with it on this car. Surprise, surprise, it even has a trunk...amazing!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned this for 2+ months, 2,300 miles. Take the reviews that are from new owners or "100 miles, just picked it up last week" with a grain of salt. It's a new car; of course they are going to love it. I am 6'4", #225. I have driven with a 6'6", #260 passenger. TONS of room. It has pep and we even climbed hills with it. You will not see acceleration records with it. But then again, it is not touted as a sports care. Contrary to what it was built for (city), I live in the country and really do like it. I have parked the Tahoe & use this for work: 30-50 mi round trip/day. Very comfortable for a little car. It gets you from pt A to pt B economically & relatively comfortably.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Room: tons of it. Jack for iPod in glove box. GREAT handling in the snow: rear wheel drive, rear engine, traction control. Tight turning radius. Can park 2 end- end in garage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was driving a 99 Porsche Boxster that I loved but was willing to trade for something different while it still had value. My husband convinced me to drive a Smart and I loved it. Now we negotiate about who will drive it the next day based on time and miles to travel. It is much more comfortable than a Boxster and as much fun. It doesn't have the power but still has plenty of zip and is so unique in that it just makes people smile and wave.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage 37-39 mpg but would be better if driven more conservatively. I like the convenience of the shifter paddles, the ease of lowering the roof, and the ability to zip in traffic. Only thing I would improve is a different dashboard without cloth covering. It also makes ME smile.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had this been a 10,000 car it would have been perfect, but not at 15 grand. Reliability = 1 star for obvious reasons - anybody who sells a car with the worst waranty in America (2 years) doesn't trust their own product. Performance is fine if you don't mind accelerating from 0-60 in 14 - 15 seconds. Certainly something I'd deal with for 100 mpg (not even near what this car gets) Gas Mileage - we're talking about pushing around a golf cart with a 1 liter engine, and 30-40 mpg on premium gas is all it gets? If this were a 10 grand car, and averaged 80 mpg I'd have 2. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is great, for as small as it is, it seems solid. Aftermarket capabilities are limitless, I can't wait till I see these sold for $500 with blown engines/transmissions. Imagine what a bit of welding and $5K for non smart car engines could do to this thing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only had the smart for 2 days, but have driven it over 100 Miles already. Around town, things are great. It's roomy inside, the controls are logically placed, and it has every thing you need for your commute. At speeds over 68 mph, the drag from wind causes the car to bumble about a little. However, it performs strongly at 70, but must be urged to maintain 80 mph. Tailwinds from large trucks toss it a little too. But this vehicle was not designed for freeway travel, anyway. The transmission is a bit jumpy at slow speeds as well. It bucks a bit when it shifts.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the size and cute design. Everyone stares and smiles! Some people even laugh at it. I love it because it is small, fun, practical, and efficient. It's comfortable to drive/ride in, but is not a wasteful or excessive vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Pros: Attention-getting, economical, affordable (for a convertible) Cons: Weak warranty (but I hope I won't need it -- this is a Mercedes!) I challenge you to try to find a convertible so elegantly designed or better engineered than this. And for $16,590. You can open the top from a distance with your key (nice to cool off the vehicle before you get to it). The side rails come off and store in a special compartment in the rear designed just for them. This vehicle is put together with true attention to detail. Some whine about the transmission, but I'm used to driving a five-speek stick so this one doesn't bother me at all. In semi-auto mode just pretend it has a clutch and go!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Big enough for me (I'm 6'3). Small enough to fit anywhere. Very attention getting on the road and even when parked. I'm always being asked about it. That's fine most of the time ... except when I am late for something or otherwise in a hurry. Still, it's loads of fun to own!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have waited for this car for many years and am delighted to finally own one. Ordering a car online prevented me from test driving it, yet I am enjoying it everytime I get into it. Still don't know if I needed power steering or not. So I got it with heated seats too. I strongly suggest not to save on some options as I did. Get the $895 package and factory alarm. It's the better option. Enjoy the cabriolet if your climate is favourable. Mileage is pretty good. Accept the fact that you need hi-test, yet it's only 7-8 gallons per refill. Transmission is quirky, yet it's still fun to drive. The clutch has a limited life apparently. I resent the fact that the extended warranty is so expensive!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy passenger compartment. Every possible crevice used for storage. Instrument layout is ergonometric. My PASSION has a moon roof for off days.

I love the auto wipers and HID lights & heated Seats. and I can put the top down at any speed on the highway how cool is that :). driving around town my milage has been 38 worst (ethanol gas) 44 best (pure gas). highway is around 49 as long as you drive under 70 MPH I think I could get 50 MPG If I drove the speed limit :) I wish It had Cruise Control and the trans takes some getting used to. the subwoofer under the seat doesn't seem to work. my dealer will look at it when I bring it in for service. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This thing is way cute and very fun to drive--it's my wife's car. She traded a 2 year old Beetle because of VW reliability problems. Want people to look at you and talk to you? Buy this car. Manual shifting is the only way to go and is easy and fun. This review is being written by a guy who just traded a 2005 Mercedes SLK 155 mph roadster for a 2008 BMW 335i convertible; yeah, this little car is that good and that fun to drive. Freeway driver it isn't -- it's got the power but gets the twitches above 70 mph due to the 6' wheelbase. I can't imagine not having this car but be sure to have a real car for trips-- this is a city car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was a Smart reservation holder from the day the reservation program opened. I've been anticipating buying my fortwo since 2006. I'm glad I followed through with the purchase because now I own a highly exclusive car with features normally only found in luxury cars. Those heated leather seats are great for days where you need a little warm comfort but don't want to kick on the heater. Negotiating lane changes and jumping in between cars when switching lanes is virtually effortless -- the engine packs plenty of power for a car that size at the cost of lower fuel economy and higher emissions than a car its size should have.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The smart is definitely fun to drive, and has excellent mileage. My best tank so far, driving conservatively on the highway, has been 53 MPG. Realistically one should expect high 30s to mid 40 MPGs, depending on driving. Mileage suffers above 65 MPH as the drag increases. The quirky transmission is the car's greatest weak spot. It is neither as smooth as a traditional auto, nor as quick to change gears as a manual. It literally takes a certain learning curve to get used to it and get smoother. Nevertheless, the car is super fun to drive. If you don't want to wait a full year for a reservation, get on your local dealer's "orphan" list for cars that have been turned down. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I first saw a smart car in Rome were they were everywhere and immediately decided that when they/if they came to US, I would buy one. I am retired and only need a car for errands and short drives within a smallish town (Santa Cruz, CA). This is the perfect size for me, easy to park, fun to drive, good visibility, safe if anyone runs into me, and the heated leather seats are a bonus. Once I got used to the transmission, it is fine as long as you use manual mode and not auto. I have only had it for 2 weeks but I have not found any downsides to it yet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got the car three weeks ago, and it's been nothing but great fun. It is a little odd handling, the transmission is something you have to get used to! I really feel a true 5 speed manual would have been better. Also note that the tire pressure is 29 PSI in the front tires and that the rear tires are 36 PSI. They were all set at 36 PSI and the handling on the highway was poor tracking and that loose front end. Gas mpg has been 37-40 on and off state highways, interstate. Also city driving, stop and go. Car has only 650 miles and not broken in. The model is the passion coupe in yellow black tridon/black interior, extra gauges, fog lights.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Yes this car will get you attention but once this fad wears out, it will be nothing but a joke. After driving this car for 4k miles I have gotten mixed reviews, some laughs and some positive remarks. I average 31 MPG but when I drive on the highway at 70 MPH it drops to about 26 and it has zero power for passing. The transmission shifts very hard and abruptly from 1st to 2nd gear. The ride is rough but it is fun to drive a small car. The 2 year warranty is a joke. Every trip to the dealer costs $100 just to look at the car. As I said the car is fun to drive for a few weeks but exhausting to own and no worth buying if you need a reliable, fuel efficient car. A Honda Fit is a better value.</TEXT>

The SMART CAR PASSION was my model choice and being 6'4" 240# was a concern, surprise, surprise! I had head and leg room to spare compared to a tight fix in my wife's Lexus RX. I figured the SMART to be my summer "toy". Since taking delivery we had a snow storm and horrible side streets, the SMART handled the snow quite well.

<TEXT>The SMART is not the best car for some, but, if you understand what it offers, it may be the perfect car for you. It delivers great gas mileage, fits two tall people very comfortably, can be easily towed behind an RV and is a great around town car. Don't buy the smart if you are expecting the manual transmission it comes with to shift smoothly (it is not an automatic, but a manual that can be driven in automated mode). It shifts just fine if you drive it in manual mode. If you are a baby boomer with no kids at home, or someone looking for an around town car to go to work or run down to the grocery store, or even to commute a reasonable distance to work, this may be your car.</TEXT>

Gas Mileage is excellent (38- 44)but don't expect miracles. Seating is comfortable. Car is a little jerky if wind is kicking hard. I've had mine up to 101mph and still a little room left.

<TEXT>Skinny front tires and auto trans makes ABS come on with every stop in snow. The rear wheels are always trying to drive forward as you come to a stop, so it's up to the fronts to stop the car AND the motor. I've gotten in the habit of popping it into neutral as I'm stopping. I have no confidence in slippery stopping times. Roads made bumpy by frost heaves and potholes make for a punishingly harsh ride. The suspension must have only a couple of inches of travel because it doesn't take much to jolt the whole car on a bump. But when the roads are dry and smooth it's fun to drive.

It was a warm and sunny afternoon (for Michigan) On my drive home from the dealership I reached 82 MPH on the freeway and felt comfortable and safe. Once at home I felt like a celebrity as many people approached me to ask me about my new car. In fact wherever I go people stop me to ask about the car. I always tell them that the car handles well in every weather situation I have encountered so far, I have been averaging 35.9 MPG, And my commute to work is 19 miles. Also I work in downtown Detroit and finding parking can be difficult at times. However I have been able to park cheaply or even free on many occasions. SMART USA </TEXT>

<TEXT>Wherever you go, you can hear people announce your arrival ("Smart car!"). That aside, the car has unexpected power on the highway. This car, like a small dog, doesn't know it's small. Love the convertible top, though, which can open and close at any speed. Mercedes technology makes the car very quiet with the roof up compared to other convertibles (like the noisy Miata, for example). You get used to the upshift from 1st to 3rd, although my spouse prefers to use the paddle shifters for a smoother transition.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove the Smart for 14 miles each way to and from work for 6 months, enjoying the good mileage and fun handling. Parking was easy and it was a comfortable ride. The problem I ran into was a lack of stability in windy settings. I had a scary incident when I was blown into the lane next to me as a result of driving on a windy day and having a truck drive past me, which moved me over to the next lane. Thankfully there was no one in that lane, but it could have been a real problem. As a result I sold the car the next day. I don't think this is a typical situation and in no way blame the design. It's something to keep in mind when you are considering the Smart.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I originally purchased the smart car to resell. After the first week, not only did I decide not to sell it, but I'm gonna order a convertible for my wife. I have quick take offs & average driving speed is 75 mph. I get about 35 mpg in standard mode & 39 mpg in auto mode. The best I can obtain is 46.8 mpg. I'm impressed with the interior room, performance & features. I don't always like the attention. People ride too close & as a result, I'm afraid I'm gonna get a ticket for >85 mph trying to get away. It handles well, is a blast to drive and is a huge surprise to everyone who sits inside. I'm 6'0" & 200 Ibs with plenty of room to spare. I don't move seat all the way rearward. Love It!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bright Lights! The dim & fog lights stay on with brights. The auto lights & auto adjust windshield wipers are awesome. The ESP is much more advanced than expected for this price range. Electric windows, heated leather seats, moonroof, optional std or auto trans, storage space & fuel economy!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car is fun to drive, handles well in the corners and in traffic it is very nimble. Interior is comfortable and when you keep in mind what the car is designed for it meets all the criteria very well. Fuel economy is basically how well you control the right foot.

<TEXT>Started driving them in Europe over 7 years ago and they were a delight, cute , very maneuverable, and fit in all the very small places in Rome,Paris, and London. Tried immediately to buy one (they were 60,000 lire/$6000 US in Rome) when I first tried. They would not sell me stating that the U.S. would not allow me to import them. My wife and I ordered one each in late 2007 and they arrived in May and July 2008. They are a delight to drive and have plenty of pep, a delight to merge onto the freeway and can easily go 90 mph or higher if some SUV gets testy and aggressive. They are very safe & stable weighing in at more than a ton, have ABS and ESP, 4 airbags & a 5+ crash rating. Go for it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very maneuverable,effortless steering (especially with power steering). Very BIG and LITTLE (big inside and small outside),very colorful, attractive,cheerful and outright fun. Lots of thumbs up and many many inquiries. My wife and I often fit our two Smarts in one parking place-NO tickets yet!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I awaited my Smart car with great anticipation. Ordered it online in late April of 2007 and took ownership May 1 2008. The room inside is amazing. This summer I drove all over Boston, usually 40-60 miles a day. I had a minimum of 5 full conversations with strangers about this cute little car. When in stop in go traffic I realized that using the car in manual provided a much smoother ride. I now prefer to drive that way and I find I get 10 more miles per gallon. Having the option of shifting on the stick or on the steering wheel is a great choice. Beware of potholes, railroad tracks and road work going over these too fast- scares the wits out of you. Easily driven at 70 mph with no problem.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The large heated seats, the rear storage area, the constant attention form total strangers. The option of auto or manual is great. I never drove a manual because of the clutch, with his car I don't have one. I love that. When I want to drink coffee or chat on my cell I leave it on automatic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I brought a new 1959 Volkswagen back from Germany in 1959. This car reminds me of the 1959 Volkswagen. It performs better than you think it could and people wonder what it is. I can't believe how well it handles on the highway. I really like the way the transmission operates. I expected poor performance but if you know how to drive this car you will be happy with it. I had only 37 HP with the Volkswagen while this car has 70 or so. I was extremely pleased with the Smart dealership in Orlando. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Midsized car seating is comfortable , visibility to front and sides is good to the rear it is poor . the interior layout is good as are the basic cd and A/C . Steering and handling are responsive and with a small turning circle as you would expect. Corners well . Winds of 50 mph will nudge the car but you still have control. Engine is minimally audible from inside even at high rpm . The transmission I would compare to a motorcycle being shifted without the clutch but in an excellently smooth manner . so that eventually you basically shift with the accelerator . actually fun and smooth no complaints. Power delivery depends on the drivers ability to master shifting. Can be driven on highways .</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is a fun car to drive . Yet has a comfortable interior. And Power is surprisingly adequate. The transmission is what makes the car fun. Much faster than you would expect thanks to the transmission . Parking is a cinch.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had never touched a Smart before getting my little red convertible. I am 6' 4" and was concerned about fitting in a little car. I was extremely pleased with the tremendous amount of room in the cabin. My knees comfortably fit under the dash. My wife had to laugh once she got in. The ride with the top open is fantastic. I was amazed with the headroom with the top closed. The mileage has been terrific in town where I regularly get 41 mpg. I had to chuckle with my first fill up of 3 gallons after my 1st 130 miles. The car drives well on the highway and over distances. My foot got a little heavy on a highway and I opened it up to 95. It's a great commuter car and a ball on the weekends</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The powered top is terrific. I leave the side bars up if it looks like rain and run with the top down. I can raise the roof with a touch of a button.

<TEXT>After seeing the Smart in Europe for years, I was pleased when mine came (as an orphan car). I have never experienced less than 40 MPG in city and freeway driving. Poor Mileage. The upright seating is remarkable. Tested a Honda Fit, the seating was low and uncomfortable. Although not a high performance machine, it's very peppy even at freeway speeds. I was surprised at the space behind the seats with the two-way opening rear door lets you put even tall things in upright. Electric top is great, with windows up it has minimal wind whipping around. Very fun to drive. Can go anywhere without people with questions, one person followed me home to ask about it. (yes it was annoying)</TEXT>

<TEXT>My son shamed me out of my V8 Silverado. So driving the Smart Car to work - 100km/day. Emissions - from 12 L/100 km to 4 L/100 km. Lost my Diesel 2 days ago. Dealership never explained the parking procedure for the 2006 model. Read the Operator's Manual carefully before purchasing the Smart Car. Anyways it rolled across the street even with the EBrake on. Now have the 2008 Limited Edition. Gas Model. Always stopping to fill up the tank - a bit of a pain. But I figure I saved about $250/mos. in fuel and emitting a smaller foot print. Off to dealership again 135 km away-glitch in Cargo Door window. Normally I go to the city once a year- so far I've been there 6 times.So much for the carbon issue.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Reading about smarts online I was very excited about the purchase. I had heard tales of astronomical fuel economy and how the EPA numbers were grossly overrated. After owning a smart for several months I can say that this isn?t the case. It only gets about 2-3 MPG better than the civic it replaced. It is much slower, doesn?t brake as well, doesn?t handle as well, and has far less room. The build quality is also dubious with minor trim pieces breaking or feeling very flimsy. For such a small car with such a small engine and so few amenities I feel it should get much better MPG. If you are buying this looking for an ultra fuel saver spend a few dollars more and get a civic/focus/corolla. </TEXT>

But I drove it for a day until he sold his truck, then another day, then he wondered why the FOR SALE sign kept disappearing from his truck! I LOVE IT! We compared and the seat is almost as high as the Highlander! It is very easy to get in and out of for me. A review we read said that it was built higher than Hondas and Camrys. It will be a very sad parting after a week of zipping around the town with our big Golden Retriever "Cruzer" riding shotgun! He thinks everyone is looking at him so he is a proud guy too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my SC for only seven months and I like it more and more. It did have an initial "breaking in" time during during which I got accustomed to its shifting and handling and it "adapted" (according to the dealer) to my driving style. It did take awhile to get used to the shifting. While it isn't a "luxury" car it has many features that I consider luxurious and it has safety features which are extra on many cars, like a built-in roll bar, electronic stabilization, disc brakes, etc. While it is small (which I =love=) it sits high so that visibility is excellent. </TEXT>

What is neat is the car will go over 80 miles per hour in 4th gear, ha. I would like Cruise control on the car and arm rests on the seats. And I will probably have Cruise control installed.

<TEXT>I drove the Smart 920 miles the first day I had it. Averaged 44 MPG. The fit and finish look more like cars costing twice the price. If you are in a hurry be careful where you stop. People just go crazy over this car and will delay you for sure wanting to know all about it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Averaging 36 MPG in heavy stop and go, bumper-to-bumper traffic. On the road I get mid-40's. With AC off I can average over 50 MPG at 55-60 MPH. If you currently enjoy driving / riding in a large luxury vehicle you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a fun to drive, small, easy to park, inexpensive, economical vehicle for mostly city driving and you have no need for more than 2 seats or a lot of storage, it will be difficult to beat the smart. This vehicle is not perfect - it is what it is!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Smart Fortwo, what a great (big) little car. I picked up my smart car and drove it from Michigan to Minnesota. What a delight! Putting some miles on the car on the first day was so much fun. This car handles well and is so spacious inside. I was really happy with my purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm in line for another cabriolet, but the wait is now 18 months, so I found one in Sherman Oaks, CA. With only 2000 miles on it an no dings at all. It was just like brand new. I traded in a Ford Explorer. I have owned Ferraris and this car is as much fun (different kind of fun). I tried it on beach streets (Manhattan Beach), freeways (LA to Orange, 405, 5, 55) and it handles great. I am glad I got the Cabrio, it is great at the beach.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everybody gives me thumbs up. I am stopped 2-3 times a day and every one want to know "home many cylinders". There are apparently 2 in Manhattan Beach (including mine), so I expect this to continue. I am 100% happy with my purchase, even considering that I had to pay a premium for not waiting.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got my car 2 weeks ago and have loved every minute of it. I've wanted a Smart for over a year and was so excited to finally get one. It is a lot of fun to drive around town. I am 6' and have plenty of room. The interior is beautiful. I feel like I'm in a $60,000 car. Mine is fully loaded and everything appears to be made with quality products. I highly recommend this car if you have the patience to wait for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I almost got side swiped going 65. My smart dodged the other car without being out of control. That's when I could sense Mercedes' technology was in this car. For a micro car, it is superbly made. The car started to drive even better when I reached the 2,000 mile mark. My partner is 6 foot 4, and he rides comfortably in the passenger seat. I am more satisfied than I thought I would be. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love driving my Lil Tic Tac. The hardest thing so far is getting out of parking lots. Everyone wants to talk about the car. Big SUVs seem determined to zip by, but I just wave at them as I pass them at gas stations. I've had no problems on the freeways at 70 mph and still getting 40-42 mpg. All town driving is getting 33-35 mpg. It is fun to drive and while it doesn't ride like a Mercedes Benz, I didn't pay for a Mercedes Benz.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Favorite feature is the room inside. I am constantly amazed at how small it looks on the outside. Love the power windows that allow me to talk to people at stop lights.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is definitely a unique car. It is sure to trigger love and hate among the owners. The good: great interior for such a small car. Great visibility. Mileage is better than epa if you drive it properly. Features galore, like clear roof, paddle shifters, fold flat passenger seat, storage in tailgate, heated cloth seats, heated mirrors, climate control. The bad: suspension needs more travel and needs to be stiffer. Too much roll. Too many thuds when bumps are hit. Automatic/manual trans is both the best and worst feature. I would prefer a straight manual. No spare tire. Premium radio is only so-so. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice interior, including a beautiful steering wheel, fabric on the dash, heated comfortable seats and more room than you expect. It is a very nice environment in which to sit. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car is fun and economical but I have had the car for 38 days and I have to send five time to the dealer for problems about the motor light up all the time. It is economical and saves gas but you have to spend more time in the dealer. They have to put a record for that or the smart is not ready for U.S.A. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I first drove a SMART a few years ago from Vienna to Prague. I loved it, and it was much less powered and of less quality construction that my new 2008 model of 2 months and 2000 miles. It's a great little car for convenience, handling, economy and appearance. Just watch out out for potholes and speed bumps, and remember that it is a small, basically low powered car, that will still drive at 80 MPH if you want to - and maybe have to on the Interstates, where huge tractor-trailers often enjoy driving 5-10 feet behind you at that speed. Where are the cops when you need them?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Although we had some reservations about buying a Smart car, now that we have owned it for 3 months there are no regrets. It is fun to drive, comfortable for two large people, and provides a reason for all of those who see it on the road a reason to smile. We can fit groceries for a week for two in the back compartment, as long as it isn't a Costco trip with large bundles of paper and cleaning supplies. The gas mileage is OK, 33-38 mpg with mostly in town driving, but it is so much fun to drive and pass the big land yachts that are so prevalent in Naples Florida.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I received my Smart Cabriolet after a 12 mo. wait. It is worth every minute of the wait. Fun, fuel efficient and cute as a lady bug. The convertible feature is cool in that the top can be taken down or put up while driving at any speed. The stereo is great for such a small car. I put myself and a buddy, (both 200# plus) and accelerated 0 to 60 in two blocks, not bad for a care that gets 40 mpg in town and 50 hwy. If you have a chance to drive one, I recommend it and if you can buy one, do it. They are getting harder and harder to find.</TEXT>
