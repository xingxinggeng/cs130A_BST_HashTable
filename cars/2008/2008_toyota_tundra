<TEXT>I was very close to buying a diesel pick-up for hauling and longevity but after much research and many test drives I purchased the Tundra. It has TONS of power, rides as smooth as a car. I have hauled very heavy loads in the bed 1000+lbs and I really can't tell the difference. I do a lot of hunting in the mountains (Colorado) and it has done everything I need and then some. 15000 miles and absolutely no issues! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Extremely powerful engine that roars through and over the Rocky Mountain passes as if they were speed bumps. Great looking truck, a coat of wax will make it mirror like! Very comfortable and rides smooth. Toyota quality and dependability. Tranny and drive train are second to none.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Driving 130 miles + daily to and from work, I average 18.5 miles/gallon at the sweet spot of 63 miles/hour. Freeway I have gotten up to 21 max. Power is great, ride is a bit bumpy with the TRD package. Ford's interior is much better designed as far as layout. The leather seats should come with the ventilated option like the highlander. No real problems yet, emergency brake needle adjusted. Tires on the TRD hydroplane a lot, will not use the BF Goodrich next time. I should have opted for the navigation system, and forgotten about the JBL under the back seat. Interior storage room lacks, but the 6.5 foot bed is just the right size for most parking lots. All in all would I buy another, YES.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had the old tundra with the 281HP (2006) and what a difference the 5.7L is compared. This puppy has what it takes, while I don't tow a lot, I know she has what it takes. Once you start her up, she is ready to go!!! My truck acts like a pit bull on a leash with a poodle walking in front of it. You can feel the power this piece of machine has as you speed up and slow down through the tranny. My truck is barely over a year and a half old and I have about 44k miles on it. Beside oil changes (60 bucks a pop) and the power steering fluid change, nothing has gone wrong. I'm close to buying tires for my 18 inch rims, for 4 tires - firestone wants about 900, and sam's club about 600 for michelins.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The JBL sound system is something to listen to, the bass is located under the rear seat and packs some thump!!! The clarity of the speakers is awesome to listen when cranked up...just hook up your ipod and take'er to about 80 and it's smooth sailing...bluetooth is also nice to have and play with.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Biggest truck driven so far. Sometime it felt like driving a school bus because it's so big inside and outside. Love the Big V8 and Big brake. Truck is very quiet and firm on the roads. The only thing I don't about this truck is that it uses too much gas. Getting around 14-18MPG on mix driving. Got to trade it in for Tacoma or 2nd home equity loan soon because getting expensive to fill up the gas tank. I don't understand how millions of people can afford to drive any Big V8 everyday because I can't...</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wonderful truck. Have had all the others and no comparison. Rides well, handles well and smaller V8 handles my needs. Same story on gas mileage as everyone else, but the same or near all the others. Paint seems thin and scratches way to easy. Truck needs door mouldings and doors ding easily. Upgraded wheels are dull and lifeless. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice ride, good acceleration. Numerous compliments on appearance. I have added chrome wheel skins, door handles, mirror covers and graphics. Love the huge console and all the storage features. Easy tailgate lifting. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Small V8 performance and with it's five passenger, hard top coupe styling, "cozy", intimate, and, very comfortable, four adult pass interior, coupled with decent gas mileage... makes it the perfect choice for a single "empty nester" like myself. The 21.5 MPG Hwy, is the "frosting on the cake", pretty amazing for a vehicle this size. The 60-40 split, flip up rear seat with under seat storage holds all my camping gear or whatever, securely locked. Plus, I can tow up to 5000lbs if I want... Great Truck!... Looks great, I get lots of compliments. Mine is White with Graphite, Bucket seats with Console... My traveling office.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If someone would've told me ten years ago that today I would own any truck other than a Chevrolet (especially a Toyota), I would've died laughing at them. I bought a left over '08 model for my wife and she can't keep me out of it. The performance for a full sized truck is amazing. My daily driver is an '06 Nissan Altima SE-R, and the truck is as fun to drive as the car is. I'm actually thinking about getting rid of the car to buy one of the Tundra TRD Sport Editions for myself. Gas mileage is my only complaint, HOWEVER, I knew it wasn't going to be great when I bought it. Let's face it, in order to tow 5 tons, you gotta give somewhere. Having said that, it still gets 18mpg on the highway. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>These Tundras are SEXY, PERIOD! Body lines - Beautiful. Interior - Super. I love the 4 "full" doors instead of the rears suicides like all the others. Except for AWD and ONSTAR, this truck has everything my '05 Sierra Denali had on it, and the Tundra outperforms the Denali, EASILY!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Awesome truck over all. The dashboard is quite noisy in the colder months due to plastic. The quality of the body material is terrible. You can literally leave a dent in the truck if you smack it w/ your hand...this is not "truck" quality. I worry that the truck will look several years older than it actually is in just 3 years due to the poor quality body panels and paint.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a 1st generation Tundra for a 2nd gen. Tundra. I have hauled my family + car up and down the Rocky and Cascade Mountains with both trucks. As much as I liked the 4.7L, it knew the weight was there. But as I expected, the 5.7L didn't flinch or break a sweat going up the steep grades. Some owners find the engine braking annoying. However, I find that when you are hauling and going down a steep grade it allows for the driver to have control of the vehicle + whatever you're hauling. Overall, this truck has exceeded my expectations.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my 5.7L for about a year and will exceed 25K miles this year. This is a well-made vehicle. It replaced my 05 F250 diesel. Now this is no F250, but I do pull 6000 pounds with it and it's pretty good. Without the trailer it's just plain fun to drive. Of course mashing the accelerator cost you lots of money because the fuel mileage is pretty poor. I'm mostly highway and I average around 16 mpg. The price I got a year ago was incredible. This is a whole lot of truck for the money. Only real complaint I have on this truck is the paint. It's very thin and scratches very easily. This is a common complaint of the Toyota Truck Forums.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck is truly awesome. I drove the half ton version of Ford, Chevy, and GMC. I had my heart set on the GMC until I drove the Toyota. It absolutely blew the others away in every category (smooth, fast and powerful, great room, great specs, great looking). It is a night and day difference when you drive them all back to back.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I honestly can say that this truck out accelerates (barely) my 400+ hp modded dodge hemi similarly equipped featurewise, no doubt due to its 4.51 rear gear ratio which seems to get overlooked in comparison tests as the main reason it's so quick. As far as handling the steering felt looser than my ram which has 80000 miles and the brakes were softer than I expected. Overall it's a nice truck but it's not my style inside or out and if I ever tow 10000 pounds on a regular basis I'll be driving a diesel.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love this truck extremely. Had an 04 tacoma with trd package, kinda rough. Traded that in for an 06 tundra 4dr. with the TSS package. When I read about the new tundras with the 5.7, went to test drive one. Loved the power. So in feb. 08, went in and came out with an 08 Limited with the TSS package. Had to get used to the auto tilt, and telescopic steering wheel.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My last truck was a 1500 gmc and while it was a decent pick-up this truck is heads and shoulders above it.The 5.7 is powerful and the 6 speed transmission is real smooth. I have a 24' travel trailer that weighs 5800 lbs loaded and it pulls it with no effort at all. Dislikes: I don't like the way it revs when you first start it cold. It's almost 2000 rpms and holds for about 10 to 15 seconds. The gas gauge reads 1/2 full and only takes 8 gallons of fuel and the oil gauge holds slightly below the 1/2 mark. I've never had a car or truck that didn't hold a least 30 lbs oil pressure when driving, but I'm being told that this is normal. I'm keeping an eye on it and hopefully it won't go lower.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for the replacement of my old F150. I did my research (here at Edmunds as well :)) and just for the kicks decided to stop at the Toyota dealership. I've heard bad things about earlier TTs. I was not really going to buy one. But after testdriving TT with 5.7 6A I turned around and bought the truck. Just like that. No other trucks to test, no hesitations, no regrets. I've been driving it for a month now. Two trips to skiing areas (lots of snow). Couple of long rides on the freeway. IT IS NICE. There's nothing that I've driven before (truckwise) come even close. </TEXT>

After buying my wife a new Highlander the dealership made me an offer I couldn?t refuse on a new Tundra, and I love it. By far the best truck out there. Standard features are amazing, don?t really need to add much to it to make it the perfect truck. I got 20 MPG on the highway coming home, you can?t go wrong.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first truck. Every vehicle I have ever owned was under powered and I made an agreement with myself that I would not make this mistake in a truck. I took it a little to far, because this truck has more power than I will ever need. But it is so much fun to smoke an F150 off the line when they feel the need to egg me on.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is well designed and the ride is excellent for a truck. I took a 1300# load to the dump the other day and even though the rear suspension told me something was there, the engine didn't even skip a beat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had many trucks, all brands, some have been better than others but this Tundra is the best one that I have ever had. It is so much fun to drive that I'm looking for reasons to go out! I bought a 2007 SR5 SB in Nov 07 and while it was OK, I really wanted the LB version without the Off-Road package. So I sold the SB with only 1389 miles and bought the SR5 LB and couldn't be happier. It rides smooth, has unbelieveable power, and gets decent mileage. I have installed a back-up camera, fog lights, self-dimming mirror, in-channel visors, sill protectors, duals and bed extender all OEM and the great thing is that it was already prewired for all the electrical installations. I love this!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Leased this vehicle in Nov, 2007. 4,800 miles as of Feb, 2008. Former owner of a 2005 Dodge Ram Powerwagon. The Tundra Limited equipped with the off road package and navigation system is far superior in every respect, except dedicated offroading (no stock truck beats the Powerwagon for that). The Tundra is a large vehicle, but the parking sonar, rear view camera and outstanding turning radius makes it relatively easy to park and maneuver. Road manners are outstanding with performance car-like acceleration and passing capability. Back seat leg room is the best in its class. If it wasn't for its truck-like gas mileage (14.5 mpg average so far), it could easily pass for a daily driver.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quality, performance, utility, technology, comfort, style. Front/rear parking sonar, navigation/back-up camera/bluetooth phone system. This vehicle convinced me to trade in my '04 Mercedes Benz 4matic for an '08 Lexus GS350awd. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have always wanted a truck and when I was finally 'allowed', I traded my Lexus LS430 and Ford Explorer. I am so happy with my decision. I have already upgraded with a truxedo cover, upgraded homelink mirror, running boards, and backup mirror. I have been buying a lot of my parts. Maybe I should have paid an 5k for the limited? Who cares? This truck fits me so well and is a joy to drive. I am excited everytime I go into the garage (which by the way, I had to clean out to the back wall to fit this monster in!). My only concern is driving through the parking garage in Philly and wondering if the top will scrape! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great truck in every way - except the rough ride. I love the accessories and the 5.7 liter engine. The six speed transmission is very versatile. The 4X4 works great in heavy snow and on ice. The ride, however, is bone jarring and very uncomfortable on anything except a smooth asphalt hiway. It feels like it needs about 2000 lbs. of load in the back to calm the jerky ride. I strongly recommend that if you have neck or back problems, look elsewhere. Fuel economy is not great but is what I expected - about 15 mpg average for all driving conditions. Brakes are excellent, leather seats also. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>5.7 liter engine has loads of power. Interior is excellent. Good sound system, navigation system is great. Tons of leg room front and back. Very good towing capacity and handling. Turning radius is incredibly small for a big truck so it is easy to park.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>For the person who needs a 'Luxury Car' but WANTS A TRUCK- I would suggest looking into the Tundra X-SP Package. The leather seats and carbon fiber accents throughout the dashboard and arm rests make this truck luxurious and sporty. The BBS wheels and 305/50R 20 Michellins give this truck the perfect look, stance, and a ride that rivals any luxury car I have ever ridden in. The backseat of the double cab is roomy enough for someone who is 6'2" to sit comfortably behind someone 6'2" in the driver's seat. And the truck handles like a DREAM! I have driven F150s, RAMs, and Titans and this truck out accelerates and handles all of them. I LOVE MY TRUCK!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Most comfortable, useable vehicle of the more than 100 I have owned. Great power and road presence with mpg that is very good considering weight to get 19-20 mpg with reasonable, adult driving. Spacious interior and level of comfort make it ideal for long road trips. This is the 36th truck I have owned and it gets rated #1 for the reasons above, plus, it just FEELS right, like I am more at ease in going from point A to point B.

Super roomy, and I'm 6' 200, friends are all bigger than me and we all spread out when I'm driving. Only way I'd be happier is in a $100k luxury sedan, and I'm not rich, so this truck definitely has it all for the working man! Top ends are nice, but way too much for not that much.

<TEXT>This will be Tundra #3 for me. While I enjoyed my last Tundras this one is by far the most capable. Excellent acceleration, braking. Can't wait to hook it up to my travel trailer and see how she tows! Like the comfort and conv. items in the interior. Turning radius is awesome! Special ordered mine took a bit to get but worth the wait. If you're in the market for a full sized p/u, you've got to give the all new Tundra a look. I drove the others and found the Tundra to be superior. The Dodge was cheap looking int., the Ford rode terribly. The Chevy was a close second but reliability scared me away.

<TEXT>I love this truck - and the more I drive it the more I like it. The nav system is great. Bluetooth for cell phone is nice. Powertrain is amazing - smooth and strong. My kids love the back seat room. Get a tube step, its a big step up without one if you're less than 6ft. MPG is poor & getting worse(13-14 mixed driving), & my friends DC 4x2 5.7 is beating me by 4mpg, which is a big mpg hit for the CM 4x4. Reading dash gauges is like looking at them thru a tube-these could be better. Gas gauge is VERY pessimistic, says I'm empty when I still have 5 gal. Reflection of clock on windshield at night. I get lots of positive comments on the truck. I don't miss my F250 Crew diesel at all.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded in my 2006 Hyundai Santa Fe to buy a new 2008 Toyota Tundra. So far I love everything about the tundra. I was concerned about poor gas mileage, but that is not the case. The 5.7 L can actually get better gas mileage because it is a 6 speed. It all depends on how you drive it. The ONLY complaint I have about the Tundra is that the ride is a little bit rough. I think that the everything else about the Tundra is so nice though that it easily makes up for the rough ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just feel that I have a truck with great resale value and amazing quality. This is my 4th now Toyota purchase and I am a former big three owner. I love the sonar the big mirrors and the tough looks of the truck itself. It has amazing power speed and throaty rumble when going do the road. Finally it is a work horse and tows my tandem 30 foot trailer with effortless performance</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The standard options, transmission power driver seat bigtemp guage tow haul with the press of a button, knobs big use full center council. The best feature is the power back window going completely down, adjustable rear seats with tilt. I truly feel the quality is superior? </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First, I traded in my 1995 Toyota pick-up with 156,000 miles. Test drove the others then came back to Toyota as usual. The 2008 Tundra had cloth seats, single CD player, manual adjust seats and didn't come with floor mats. I bought the Tundra hands down (and it wasn't that much cheaper). Unfortunately I'll have to wait for another 12 or so years to get a new truck... they're built that good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very good deal, on a very well designed and built full size truck. Performance enhanced by 6 speed transmission, this truck drives extremely well in ordinary traffic and cruises on the interstate. If you need to get past slower traffic, just put your foot down and very easily and safely accelerate past. Breaking on this truck is phenominal, it stops extremely rapidly and safely. Extremely good all round truck for hauling people and a bed full of materials. Have not used it yet for towing, but should be a winner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After waiting for two years to purchase a 2nd Gen Tundra, I finally got a good deal in 12/08 on a TRD/4X4/Dbl Cab, when gas climbed to $4.00 a gallon. It was well worth the wait. I have not driven the truck that much, and just went through the first tank of gas. I was blown away when my calculations showed 21.7 mpg in combo city/highway driving (my 04 Camry gets 28 mpg). The Tundra has tons of power, space, and is a delight to drive. If you want to buy American, buy a Tundra, because it is made here in the USA by Americans in the Great State of Texas.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 5.7 V8 is a great performer, revs easy, just tons of power for a truck. Drivability is superb, although the ride is truck like with the TRD package and Blisten Shocks. I like the dampened tailgate, it helps that if you have your hands full, you don't have to worry about the gate slamming down.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first choice was a 2009 Ford F150, but could not make a deal. Bought my Tundra in Monterey, Ca and drove her home to Las Vegas, NV. I drove my truck through a multitude of highways, and this is what I learned. More power than I will ever need. Going up the grade past Baker, CA, the Tundra did not break a sweat. Drive was smooth and comfortable, but, pay attention here, there is bed bounce. Just on certain type of roads, not enough to get rid of the truck (my Dodge Ram had the same issue) but it might cause other drivers fits. Very quiet truck, cannot hear roadnoise. All in all, the best bang for the buck in its segment.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Since this Tundra 4x4 5.7 is a V8 and makes an average 14miles per gallon is SHOULD HAVE a bigger gas tank or a secondary gas tank so the truck may have more gas station independence, I hate to stop to fill up the thank every 250 miles. Pls take a note on this. The springs are too soft for heavy loads. But overall this is a great "get out of my way" looking monster which I am proud to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a great truck this is! We have had trucks from all the majors, just recently had an 03 F250 diesel. Then come our Tundra and all I can say is WOW. The powertrain in this thing is great, sleek styling lines, tow capabilities and Toyota quality is what sold us. The interior plastics could be better, ride can get a little funky over expansion joints at high speeds. In 6 months been into dealer for squealing belt twice, under warranty. We live in a GM town, and have always tried to drive something different. All the Chevys and Gmc's tend to all look alike and there are lots of them around.

Overall the Tundra is a great truck but like all other vehicles it could have some improvements. But Toyota does a lot of things to there vehicles that the domestic companies do not do like Toyota puts sealer on the edge door seams to keep from rusting and spray pvc under the vehicle and in the wheels wells to reduce road noise and to prevent rust, sprays antichip along rocker panels to prevent rock chips. I think all of these extra little things add up and is what makes Toyotas good reputation.</TEXT>

I needed something with a very high tow rating for my horses, that would still accommodate my 3 kids, and not feel like I drove a tank every day. The Tundra does all that in style. No one can believe how sexy this truck is, it is unique and turns heads everywhere I go. It is easy to drive and gets good gas mileage. It does have a blind spot if you are short and have to sit close like me, and the radio had to be replaced right off the bat, but the service has been excellent and it purrs every time I turn the key.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck came with no body side moldings and none are available from Toyota. Toyota did put an "Event Data Recorder" in the Tundra. This records vehicle operation data to be used by Toyota if it is sued (the data can also be obtained by court order and used against the vehicle owner). Guess that is where the body side molding funds went. Other manufactures are doing the same, but Dodge, for instance, at least offers side molding as an option. It gets better. I tried to find the oil filter and couldn't. I got online and found owners complaining that it was installed above the skid plate. You have to removed it to get to the oil filter.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When you live in the Rocky Mountains, 7, 8, 9 or even 13 per cent grades are not uncommon. How do you get a 6000 pound vehicle over such obstacles? Toyota has done it with a magnificent 380+ HP 400+ pound foot of torque, fire breathing 5.7L variable valve V8. Combined with a silky smooth 6 speed automatic transmission, 4.30 monster rear axle and enormous disc brakes on all four corners, Toyota has delivered a powertrain that will move this beast from 0-60 in just a hair over 6.0 seconds. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Once you have put your foot into this 1/2 ton truck, signing the sales contract is easy. No buyer's remorse here!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>By far, my favorite feature is the acceleration of this truck. Do not forget to turn off all the "nannies" that will try to inhibit the performance potential of this drivetrain.

In 3 months I have traveled 11,500 miles inc'l east to west coast r/t via Dallas. Total av gas is 16.2. Rides great on ALL surfaces. Have just towed a loaded 5 x 8 trailer and a full bed (appx 5000 lbs total) that trip alone was 1300 miles avg gas was 15.6 - bottom line this vehicle has loads of room, features, and therefore offers me 4 vehicles in one, van like space & hauling, SUV like passenger room, great gas and truck like towing. With the 4.7 V8 and an 8 ft bed I can still hit 60 in about 7.5 seconds if I need to. Best vehicle I have ever owned!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned most light trucks over the last 25 years. This by far disappoints in most categories. The ride is harsh and poorly dampened, the radio, though upgraded could not keep a station. The integrated phone system, though great in concept worked when it wanted to. The steering is vague, the transmission needs improvement. 6 spd. sounds good until you put it to the test. Coming to a stop it was evident that you could experience each speed back to 1st. 6th gear is like the old 3sp. stick if you shifted too quickly the vehicle sounded as if it were lagging... same for the Tundra. The interior: plastic. I have bought a new Avalanche, top of the line for less money... fabulous</TEXT>

However, careful recording of fuel consumption (not towing) reveals that we get nearly 18 MPG on the highway, and 17 around town, which is quite a bit better than the older Tundra. The new one has the 5.7 liter V8. Bring the trailer home over The Cascades, the truck had no problem maintaining speed up the steep grade to Government Camp on Mt.

<TEXT>Before buying I researched and read reviews about every brand of truck in this class. The Tundra was by far the most vehicle for the money especially after the rebates that were going on in July, 08. The SR5 trim level has all the most common standard features that you would not have on a similar priced Ford or Chevy. Has plenty of power with the 5.7, very comfortable to drive, quiet, and even the gas mileage isn't bad for a 6000 lb 381 hp vehicle. I travel 42 miles per day on the hilly interstates of western PA and average 15.6 mpg. On a 600 mile trip I averaged 18+. Only complaint is sometimes the transmission downshifts a little too easily even going down a moderate hill.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow! I love my Tundra. I have owned Ford trucks all my life - they are good trucks, but they don't match this Toyota. It pulls my 5000 lb 21 ft boat through the CO mountains like its not even back there. It is far superior to my previous F150 5.4 L for towing as far as power, stopping ability, and vehicle control. It does 60 mph plus on any of the grades where my F150 struggled along 38-42 mph in first or second gear. Its down right fast when I'm not towing. So far I'm getting 11.9 MPG towing the boat in the mountains and 17.5 commuting and around town. I can understand how people get lower mileage though, its fun to jump on the gas to see if it really does do 0-60 in 6 sec.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Really quiet! Lots of power - almost as strong as my old 94 F250 7.3 l Diesel. Nice sounding stereo. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Currently have just under 12k on the odometer. I have the top of the line Limited fully loaded. I traded in a 06 SR5 Double Cab for this truck. I also test drove the Silverado, Avalanche, Titan, and F-150/250's prior to purchasing the truck. Granted, everyone is entitled to his/her opinion but I just don't feel anything comes close to the Tundra... Bluetooth, nav, rear window and sunroof, huge backseat, rear DVD, aux jack for your iPod or MP3 player, heated seats, rear backup camera, huge towing power, silky yet powerful brakes, quick off the line (although it'll swallow your gas) and real "torquey" feel. Huge ride, but plush. Doesn't drive like a truck - that's a good thing to me!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system, rear backing camera, rear window and sunroof, bluetooth, room, room and more room - this things HUGE inside. Kids love the rear DVD. Lots of storage in: center armrest, side door panels, glove box, top flip up storage. It's a Toyota - so you know it's reliable!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been a Toyota fan for years. I like Corolla, Camry because they are reliable, gas efficient, good looking, keeping their value really well. A huge mistake was made when I traded in my Camry for a Tundra. I wanted a truck to haul my boat sometimes and for more fun. Auto experts have rated the truck very high. I must say, Edmunds you did totally wrong: Gas mileage: 10-13 MPG. Performance: No fun at all. Engine is very loud. When hauling, it is extremely loud. I miss my Camry very much. Quality: Cheap all around. Styling: too ugly. Reliability: 2 dealer visits per month </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Tundra. The first one was very reliable. This one drives really nice, lots of power, great handling, plenty of room in front and the backseat is awesome. If you are looking for a big truck this is it. The only drawback the interior is cheaply built for a Toyota, too much plastic which scratches very easily. The dash lay out needs some work, the radio and controls needs to shift closer to the driver's seat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first Tundra was a 2000 SR5 and after 8 years of faithful service I traded up to a 2008 DC, 4X4, LTD, TRD. The new Tundra is amazing, powerful, rides good, smooth and quiet. Lots of room for the family and can haul anything you want. I am getting 15 mpg in town and over 20 mpg on the highway which is way better than my 00. The JBL sounds great and its nice having the Bluetooth wireless for my cell. The brakes are impressive and can stop it on a dime. I have the TRD sway bar on the rear and it handles like a sports car.

<TEXT>I have put about 11000 miles on this since March 08. The engine, ride, handling, and capability are all excellent. It tows without any issues at all. I have only had two warranty issues so far, the radio and interior support pillar trim. It seems that when the dash gets HOT from the sun the trim sometimes moves out of place and warps. The transmission seems to have a mind of its own, it shifts how and when it wants to, it does not seem to be learning. Sometimes it is smooth and I can hardly feel it shift and other times it will slam the truck in gear. I am having it road tested on the next service and the transmission computer may have to be reset (according to the dealer).</TEXT>

I use it to tow a large 2 horse BP trailer (loaded weight approximately 6700 lbs./ 600 lbs. tongue weight) to and from horse shows from Pennsylvania to Maine. It tows comfortably and most importantly safely. Fuel mileage while towing at interstate speeds is 11.5 mpg, non- towing 17.5 mpg. Very respectable fuel economy for this type of truck. Additionally I get positive comments everywhere I go on how nice the truck looks fitted with a Leer 100XL cap. I highly recommend this truck for towing & hauling. </TEXT>

I have always believed that Toyota builds the best quality vehicles available, and we have high expectations that this pickup will deliver the quality we expected when we purchased. Don't see the harsh ride mentioned by other reviewers. Could be our minds will have changed towards Toyotas after having owned this one awhile. We certainly hope that will not be the case, and don't expect that it will be. Happy owners here so far! </TEXT>

<TEXT>First truck I own, second I've driven (F-150 @ work). Great improvement from the 2006 model: Looks stylish and bold, quiet and roomy interior and of course, Toyota quality built and dependability. I have the 4.7 V8 which can handle more than adequate the loads, nice power for merging quickly on highways (loaded) and excellent braking system. I guess Toyota is going to make a big hole on the sales for the big three. No doubt that the new drive train's performance comes as a result of Toyota's research and investment on its Formula 1 team. That is something that only Ford can possibly match; but by that time the Tundra will have a well earned name in the segment, difficult to beat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd tundra and Toyota did a great job on the redesign. If you do not need all of the "bells and whistles", the Tundra grade is the way to go. My husband also has a Tundra with everything on it (sunroof, leather, satellite radio) and I plan to steal it from him. The new and improved truck pulls a trailer without hesitation and still stops on a dime. My previous tundra would let me know when I had a trailer behind it. I take 4 and 1/2 hour long trips in it at least twice a month and it is such a pleasure to drive on the highway. Rainy roads lookout because this Tundra is staying on coarse and won't let anything get in its way. The truck rides well and I have roughly 13000 miles</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>#1-FUN TO DRIVE!!!! Comfort of the seats and you can actually fit a real person in the front bench seat. The power of the 5.7L and the smooth shifting transmission. Reliability is great.

<TEXT>Drove Silverados for ten years. Last new was a 1998 with 128,000 plus miles combination city and highway. Was in excellent shape when I gave it to my daughter and bought the Double Cab SR5 with big V8. Tundra handled a lot tighter than Ford or Chevrolet with less effort. Ride is smooth on and off road. Comfortable in front seats and back according to my 6'4" son-in law. Still in break in period with 1500 miles on it. Driving 70 to 75 MPH with air conditioner on and cruise set I average 19.8 MPG highway and city is 15.3 with air conditioner on. I do avoid stop and go traffic as much as possible which has helped the gas mileage a lot. Better gas mileage than my 1998 Silverado. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2002 Tundra and decided to trade it in for an 08 and couldn't believe the size difference. It is very quiet, but seems to have more bounce to the suspension, which is not rough though. The interior change I hated to see go is the sun visor redesign, which has no pull out extension when turned to the driver window. The sun is always past it!! Also, the visor in front of the main visor is gone. Both of these in combination was the perfect sun block no matter where the sun was. Now I am blinded from front and side. The front visor is worthless as far as I am concerned. It is too short. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE> Leg room has greatly improved. A/C controls are more accurate, and not just 3 settings. Also seems to cool the cab off much faster. Front and rear sync is great.

<TEXT>This is a quiet, powerful, well mannered truck. Our biggest surprise after getting the truck home and using it for a while is how huge this thing is. It seemed good sized at the dealership but must have thought the extra effort needed to climb up inside the cabin and not being able to reach over the side of the bed was due to the way it was on display. Nope, it's just huge. Not a complaint just a realization. Ours is a standard suspension 4X4 with Michelin road tread tires inflated to Toyota's recommended pressure, which makes the ride in the cabin dead quiet and silky smooth. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I did a lot of research and read many reviews before buying. Many complained about mileage, I have been getting 17.5 mpg on average with "mostly" responsible city driving. For a large v8 truck I feel that is great. The fuel guage drops quickly from full but slows as the level gets lower, and like every other review, when the light comes on there is 4-6 gallons left. The truck is very quiet inside and comfortable with ample room and storage. A/C and radio controls seem far away, the grade radio is less than desireable. Tow mirrors are good but add minor wind noise. Overall I am extremely happy. It's not a super duty, but it's an excellent truck and fun too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, the 5.7 is more efficient than the 4.7, but both are great. Fold down center console/seat, very versatile. Quiet cabin and great fuel mileage for a truck make it a nice driver.

<TEXT>I love this truck. I had a 2003 Tundra before this which was admittedly a little small and not powerful enough. Well the new design rocks. It definitely drives more like a full size truck, similar to F-150 or Silverado. The power is awesome, fantastic for towing, and has a great big bed with optional tie downs. Build quality is excellent, as you would expect, and I have had zero issues, not even a rattle in 10k miles. If you are considering a Detroit truck, you owe it to yourself to test drive the Tundra.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powerful engine, awesome 6-speed transmission, smooth ride, tight build quality</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked up the truck a week ago and have put 300 miles on it. The interior comfort is outstanding although I am 6'2" tall, and my head is almost on the ceiling. Seats are far better than previous models and far more comfortable than the competitors I looked at. The rear seat area is huge and plenty comfortable even for me. Interior quality seems better than previous models and offers a quiet ride. The ride has impressed even my wife, and she loves to drive it. The power is noticeable and I am sure it will tow the boat effortlessly. 15 mpg in burbs, but should improve with break in. I am concerned about the quality of the paint as it does not seem to be nearly as good as our 2004 Sequoia</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats, power, driving characteristics, interior quality, memory seats (finally), soft drop on tailgate. Hoping for same quality we have enjoyed with previous Toyota.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Very disappointed with the brakes on my 2005 Ford F-150 XLT. I had test driven a couple of 08 Tundras in the past year and a half and I was very impressed with the feel and the power of Toyotas brakes. They are awesome! When you want to stop you stop! With the Ford I was always a little apprehensive with the brakes, always anticipating an early stop and even when I would plan ahead I always felt that they were unsafe. Well I have to tell you after 4 Ford trucks Ford has lost me as a customer. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Brakes! The stereo (its great), the ride and so far good mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Toyota built this truck for eye appeal. Look closely at the mechanicals and you will find a light duty, cheaply built truck. How this thing ever made Motor Trends "Truck of the Year" award, I'll never know. I traded in a '99 F-150 for it. The 150 was a much better mechanically engineered truck-hands down. Have owned trucks/heavy eq. 34 yrs. do all my own work on everything I own, have an extensive background in mechs. This truck is a piece of junk! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Having owned all of the big three trucks and an older Toyota Tundra, I will say that the new 08 Tundra is the best truck I have ever owned. It can do it all and combined with Toyota quality and great service it's a winner. Great brakes, power, towing and lots of room. This truck is great to drive, tow and is fun off road in 4x4.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A very well built truck. Comfortable suspension with the necessary power to get the job done. Advice: test drive both the 5.7 vs. 4.7 and you decide the perfect HP needed for your lifestyle. I'm satified with my 4.7 with a tow package and it carries the ponies! Yet if cost is not an issue 5.7 is the best choice. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior style and added thumb shifter for towing needs. Also, Toyota has added a soft drop to the tailgate. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This truck is amazing, I've heard people talk about the kick in the engine, but I only feel it when I put it into reverse.... it kicks HARD!! But Toyota sure has gotten tougher, it cost me, but it's worth the reliability and customer service.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, design, and reliability.</FAVORITE>
