<TEXT>We traded our 2005 jeep wrangler in on this 2008 Trail rated Patriot. We got a quiet ride on the highway,(finally)and didn't give up our off road fun. This car definitely has a dual purpose. I recommend this car for its fuel economy. I recommend this car for its easy driving and parking in town and I love this car for the fun of short off road trips.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven this car for 18 months. I have had no problems to date. It handles very well in snow, rain, and muddy dirt roads. Fuel economy is around 24-25, but decreases significantly with anything on the roof. I just installed two infant seats and barely fit them in. I am 5'10" and had to pull the seat 1 click forward from my usual position to fit them in. If you have long legs and plan on adding a car seat, buy different car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Rear view mirror positioned too low causing visibility problems. Plastic door finish vibrates. Lots of road noise. Water leaks in front dome light (could be front window seal?). Impossible to utilize indicator switch at night without flipping to high beam. Great gas mileage (45 imperial mpg @ 60 mph on flat highway, 30 mpg in town). Mechanical no problems whatsoever after 12,000 miles. Tremendous traction in snow.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first time writing a review, but had to let everyone know how well the Jeep Patriot drives. I had mine almost two years and haven't had one issue to repair or replace. Love the plastic interior as I have two big dogs. Seats are comfortable and easily cleaned. The performance is great. I do a lot of city driving and still average 24 mpg. I couldn't beat the price of less than $13,000! Well done Jeep. With the money I saved not buying a Rav-4 or CRV, I had a great cross country trip in my Patriot.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plastic interior and leathetee/vinyl seats, several safty features that are standard, side air bags, traction control, tire inflation etc.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have owned this Patriot since February 2008. We are glad that we chose and were able to get the manual transmission with the 2.4L engine. You need to plan to accelerate and be in the right gear when passing or other. Yes, it would be nice to have more power (or maybe a small turbo), but it has been a great vehicle. For the price and options we have, it has delivered all we expected and more. The only "glitch" has been on rare occasions where we have experienced some type of "unbalance" when driving and using the 4 x 4. It is not a wheel or tire issue, possibly something with the transfer case. We plan to replace it with an identical model, if we can find one on a dealer lot someday</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Manual transmission gives fun to drive experience and both clutch and trans have been foolproof.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving a van for so many years, I wanted something smaller and more gas efficient. In the city I get 20-21 mpg. I don't touch the "stick shift" and I'm fine with that. On the highway it "a dream" I thought that the small engine would sputter, but it's "smooth as silk", no hesitation in front of any vehicle!! Once friends and family see the style and learn about the package they are impressed, and want to drive my " Flaming Red Beauty"!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well - I'm a die-hard jeep fan....of Wranglers!! Had a Sahara and then a Rubicon...but the mileage was killing me - so I downgraded to a better MPG model. This car is no fun and I had the engine REPLACED at 13,000 miles and as of today - the entire A/C unit is being replaced as I key. As soon as this lease is up - I'm going back to the Wrangler!</TEXT>

<TEXT>A pleasant surprise. After being locked into Hondas, Toyotas and Nissans for 25 years I am very happy with my Patriot. It is a Jeep so the creature comforts are prioritized a hair lower - fine by me. Love the look, the practicality and the affordabilty. Great size for commuting- rides higher than a sedan and fits in any parking space with ease. This 4 cylinder has plenty of power (see favorite features). I question anyone complaining about the power - this from a man who learned to drive in a '73 Malibu with a 350 V8. If the long term reliability is any good this will be my best new car purchase ever.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 4cylinder and CVRT blew me away on trips through the mountains of WV, VA, PA & NC. Never any hesitation or drag, just strong acceleration throughout. Best performance I have had on these roads. The CRVT may be slightly detectable in town, a small price to pay for smooth powerful highway driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Acceleration is gradual, but will be good enough for merging in the freeway. It handles like a car. The back pillar does create a blind spot, but the large side mirrors help slightly with the issue. Overall, I love driving my Patriot...maybe a little too much. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>There is plenty of leg room for me as well as my passengers. The stereo system that came with the package is great. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I own a 2008 Patriot 4WD. It is not the trail-rated version, but has the CVT2. Since purchasing it, I have had it during two ice storms, one in early 2008, and the horrific one here in Kentucky in 2009. And during both storms, there was one constant: this Jeep just can't get stuck! No matter where I was driving, even without being the trail-rated version, it handled everything, including hills that full-sized trucks with off-road packages couldn't even come close to handling. The fuel economy is great, but it's not sluggish. Acceleration is great, and the auto-stick is a lot of fun, and helps with city MPGs. The interior isn't luxurious, but it's a great utility interior.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cherokee styling, comfortable seats, 4WD mode is amazing, acceleration is great, and the standard stock speakers are quite nice. I manage to get 30MPG highway. The CVT, once used to it, offers so much control to control acceleration.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had misgivings about the CVT based on what I had read, however could not find a limited with 5 speed manual so went ahead with 2.4 CVT. First weekend after break in took the family from Phoenix to the Grand Canyon. The hill up to Sunset point is notorious for slow downs given its grade. Set the cruise at 75 mph, the CVT was smooth and able to maintain 70 mph. My old 4.0 Cherokee had trouble maintaining 70 up this hill so I am now a believer in the CVT. By the way I also managed 29 mpg on the trip. This is my fourth jeep (2 Cherokees, 1 Wrangler), and so far this jeep is living up to my expectations</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was driving a F250 Lariat Crewcab but the high cost of diesel forced me to downsize. I test drove so many small SUVs and never though I would like a Jeep. My first ride in the Patriot was an instant sale. It is such a cool vehicle and looks good too. I am fascinated with the 4WD and Autostick features. I went from paying $100 a week in fuel to only $40. The inside is very roomy and just by adding a custom seat cushion, I now have the feel of a Lexus at half the price. My Boss drives a Land Rover, but to be honest, the Patriot is just as classy and having the 4WD capabilities makes it just easy to stand up to his Land Rover. Buy One! You will love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>10,000 miles and still loving it, not the fastest but smooth to drive and built with quality. I like chicken. 5 spd manual had a little trouble grinding in 3rd gear but local chrysler/dodge/jeep dealer fixed it right up with a new blocker ring. Towed a 2500 or more load from Michigan to Texas in 2 days over foothills of mountains, no trouble at all and not equipped with tow package, however i do run synthetic. This car was perfect for me with the basic package because the vinyl is easy to clean and the removable rear cargo floor is easy to clean. I am very happy with my new Jeep and look forward to a long companionship. Purchased extended warranty- lifetime bumper to bumper good buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Everyone is abandoning SUVs because of the bad MPG and costs overall to purchase. So, I figured I would see if there was a "steal" out there in the mass exodus/hype to leave SUVs. And, I found one. I got my Patriot (a complete base model that now in 2008 at least has AC standard) for $12,400 after rebates, incentives and military discount. Just drove it 220 miles across parts of Carolina and got 33 MPG highway going 65 mph. It's manual transmission, which is fine with me. Windows, locks are manual -- again, OK with me. The best thing is the larger engine (4.2) gets better MPG with manual transmission The only complaint is that options add up FAST, which is why I kept it basic.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling is classic old-school Jeep Cherokee. The size overall is perfect -- not too big or too small. It doesn't look wimpy like the Compass or, ahem, "metrosexual" as the Liberty is (not that there's anything wrong with that). Styling inside and overall is great and the price CAN'T be beat!!!!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My fiancee and I bought our Patriot in March of this year. We love the fact that it meets or exceeds the gas mileage on the window sticker every time. Another great aspect of the Patriot is the utility. The fold-flat passenger seat and the 115 watt inverter along with the Yes Essentials seats and rechargeable flashlight are priceless. We have a small family and a limited budget and couldn't have spent our money more wisely. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sliding armrest is fantastic for long trips. The auxiliary jack for an Mp3 player and the height-adjustable seat are also fantastic. My fiancee is 5'2" and I am 5'11" so the height- adjustable seat helps us out quite a bit.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We are about a month into owning our jeep patriot, and we love it! You just can't beat it for the price. It is cheap to insure, among the best for safety, gets good gas mileage (we get 22-25), and is very utilitarian. While I've heard some complain about the quality of the interior seating and the comfort, we've had no problems. We have the YES essentials fabric, and I find the seats plenty comfortable (have traveled for 3+ hours at a time in it). It's definitely not a Lexus, but i appreciate that many of the features are so functional. My sister was so impressed by our jeep that she is actually thinking about trading in her 2008 Saturn Vue for one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Great vehicle. Researched Ford Escape and all other small SUV's and the Patriot is the best value even if gas goes up to $5 a gallon. No need for you to repeat my research. Been getting about 21.5 mpg on the first tank mostly city driving though. Sharp vehicle, with really great handling, I can get it into tight spaces. Have your cake and eat it to with this SUV. Can't wait to see how it will perform in the snow.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, leather, Navigation is cool, good MPG considering it's a non-hybrid. Fuel savings of the Ford escape is not worth the higher up-front cost including any tax credit for $3k. If you want to wait 3 months for a Ford, be my guest.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A pleasure to own and drive. Appears well-built, have experienced no faults or issues and no minor irritations. I really like the CVT transmission but only with the autostick (manual override) which allows you to use the engine as a downhill brake and provides for smoother engine operation on a long uphill ride (plus a fun component if you are getting bored). Everything being considered, I cant think of a better vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fab exterior. interior looks and functionality. sunroof operation. Perfect overall size. Excellent economy (averaging 25 mpg US gallon). Great sound system with the 9 speaker option.

<TEXT>Bought my Jeep Patriot in Nov. and at 6,000 miles it has been great. Just as tough as the old Cherokees with same styling outside but updated "under the hood. Great gas mileage and performs better than most SUVs in snow. Very little wind shear on the highway when it's windy unlike many others. Bit of noise from smaller engine but plenty of pep. Only dislike is Jeep/Chrysler playing the "maintenance" game and requiring plugs at about 30,000 miles when many makers go 60,000 plus. Also use of a timing belt rather than a timing chain like Suzuki is an expense at 60,000 miles that could cost $$$. It boils down to Jeep/Chrysler wanting more bucks for the dealer to do more frequent work. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been extremely pleased with my new Patriot. On a recent trip (interstate driving) I was shocked to get a little over 28 miles per gallon. The jeep handles well on mountain roads and so far the 4wd has preformed in all situations, even though I did not get the Trail-rated editon. The room inside is generous and comfortable. I'm glad I opted for the manual transmission. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So after looking at the Chevy Equinox, Pontiac Torrent, Mazda5 and a few others, Jeep had the best lease terms and no doubt the absolute best warranty in the business, which led us to lease this truck 1 wk ago. So far so good, it's fun to drive with the euroshift making up for it's lack of spunk when passing, a little down shifting goes a long way. My own complaints are that it's 2008 and you can still lock yourself out of the car with THE KEYS IN THE IGNITION! I've already done it, if you hit the lock down manually by accident while getting out too bad!! Also the cup holders are in a stupid spot and the tailgate door is super low. I'm 5'10" and I've hit my head a few times already</TEXT>

<TEXT>We needed a new vehicle that would accommodate our two growing children and something that had decent mileage for my 134 mile daily round trip work commute. Honda Fit and other like vehicles didn't offer free safety features such as side impact airbags and A/C were considered OPTIONAL. We were floored when we found the Jeep Patriot (base model.) It offered more room, the standard features that we needed, really good gas mileage, and a fun, TONKA toy kind of ride. On this last tank of gas we averaged 26.8 MPG! Being in the NOLA area, I also wanted something big enough to sleep in if we had to evacuate:) You get a heck of a lot of bang for your buck with a Jeep Patriot!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought the Freedom Drive II off- road version a week ago and took it on a camping trip near Moab, Utah. Didn't do any offroading, just rough dirt roads, and the Patriot did great. It got 25-26 mpg on the highways and had no problems cruising at 75 and handling the hills on I-70. We had been using a minivan for these camping trips and were pleasantly surprised that we could pack all that stuff into the Patriot as it's a smaller vehicle. We have no complaints about the Patriot and that is saying something for us as we tend to be rather picky about vehicles. So this is now our camping mobile and we're very happy with the purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having traded a supercharged Grand Prix for a 4 cyl. 1.5 ton vehicle, I was a little weary about losing the performance I enjoyed. I was shocked with the performance of the Jeep and bought the vehicle after further review of reliability and economy. It won't be setting any land speed records; however, buying a 4X4 setting speed records should be of least concern. The Patriot has 600 miles now and averages 24-26 mpg including 4X4 use from a recent snow. All controls are easily located and the steering wheel controls are very handy since my GP had a similar set up. The Patriot handles like a car, but strong winds can push the Jeep. Chose the Patriot for the traditional Jeep look. A+ Jeep</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am pleasantly surprised by the quality, comfort and performance of this vehicle. Mileage in town is about 23.5 mpg and highway hovers around 29.5. In full automatic mode the car accelerates at a moderate pace, but using the auto-stick really kicks it in gear. Adequate in-car capacity (although I would recommend covering the seat backs if you haul anything that may snag them). Seat comfort and adjustability offer enough range for just about anyone.

<TEXT>If the front seats were built better, this would be the perfect vehicle. It is the perfect size, gets about 25 mpg which is good for a 4wd, has great visibility, and well designed flexibility in loading the interior. It is a real blast to drive, and getting used to the CVT transmission didn't take as long as I expected. So far, I have not discovered any factory defects and this Jeep really seems tight - no squeaks or rattles. This is built much better than other Chrysler products that I have owned. However, the front seats are thinly padded over a hard shell. There are no springs and, consequently, no give in the seats. Bumps telescope directly to your spine through your tail bone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>With the continual climb in gasoline prices & my need for a 4WD vehicle for the wintry conditions of New England, I needed a rugged yes stylish car to get me to & fro work & play safely. After searching the market for a compact SUV, I stumbled upon the Patriot. I couldn't be happier that I did! The price was right and the design is classic Jeep through and through. The heated leather seats, moon roof, and standard Sirius Radio on the Limited Edition, it was love at first test drive! Easy to maneuver around town and in tight parking spaces, but surprisingly roomy on the inside... couldn't ask for a better combination.

<TEXT>Got my 2WD base model real cheap, saved $4,300 off MSRP (Socal dealer). Positives: More fun to drive than other small SUVs I've tested. Ergonomically sound dash and cabin space. Great looks outside, wipe-down interior inside. Bucket seats. Good driving position, handles better than entry-level sedan. Easily holds surfboard/dog. Negatives: Crappy Chrysler paint job, lots of orange peel. Weirdly -- can anyone explain this? -- when mine hits 68mph the engine emits a high-pitched frequency sound. Not good ... Engine noise is moderate apart from that. I got mine with 0 miles on clock. Would recommend it to anyone. Love its looks in bad-boy black, I shoulda got the 17" rims tho ...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking to upgrade to an suv,and was willing to trade off gas mileage, then came along the patriot.I'm not a serious off roader (let's face it,95% of you with suvs never see dirt), but I need to get to the trailhead or ski area, over moderately rocky and mucky logging roads with ease.I tested it this winter a few times up some steep mountain dirt roads in deep snow and an ice storm, no problem. The engine is still breaking in,getting 22 to 23 mpg mostly around town If you don't need a rock crawler or a super sized suv,and you'd rather put your hard earned money in the bank rather than your tank, this is your vehicle.With gas approaching $4/gallon, I applaud Jeep for thinking ahead.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Both awd and 4wd, CVT works beautifully, autostick is nice so you don't have to ride brakes downhill or twisty roads. Gas mileage and descent power are a plus.

My first tank I got 26mpg and I went 309 miles before the fuel light popped on. This lifetime powertrain warranty was the selling point for me. No need to buy the FDII model unless you go off- road a ton.

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle 2 weeks ago and I love it! Its a lot of fun to drive it. You feel like you are in a bigger SUV, but its really compact and easy to handle. Not to mention that fuel efficiency is good. Just one advice, make sure you get the 5-speed manual transmission. I test drove both the automatic and the manual. The automatic version its a hog! Just what you would expect from a 2.4, 4 cyl- automatic tran combination. The manual 5-speed tran. its just perfect! Fast pick up speed and much more fun to drive!

<TEXT>Had an 05 Trailblazer that was only getting 13 mpg...went to see what Jeep had in a diesel version - test drove the Patriot and walked out with it. Live in central Oregon, most of the time didn't even have to put it into 4wd when it snowed..great handling, zippy. Very happy with this purchase..getting 22-24 mpg in town and 26-28 on road trips...have never owned a Jeep, and am impressed with this vehicle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Totaled my beloved '99 Cherokee in a crash that could have killed me, but I walked away from. Wanted another Cherokee, but with better mileage. After reading about everyone's complaints regarding power, I test drove a 5-speed manual Patriot. It seems whatever issues people have with lack of acceleration can be blamed on the CV-tranny, not the engine. "But how can I talk on the phone and sip my latte and drive a manual transmission?" You can't. Go buy a Kia. After two months, I am extremely pleased with this car. One of my initial reservations about buying it (it had everything I was looking for for less $) was that I wasn't seeing any on the roads. Seems I am seeing more and more each week.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the Patriot for two weeks now, and I am so far very pleased with this vehicle. The five-speed transmission is forgiving and responsive. The ride is quiet (in fact, the first time I came to a stop sign, I thought the engine had killed). The suspension is perfect- firm but not brittle-feeling. Vinyl seats have been nice, firm and comfortable. The vehicle rolls very freely in neutral, and the resultant glide is nice if you like to coast in to stop signs for better gas mileage. My first tank of gas gave me 33 mpg in mixed suburban driving, no freeway. There is good visibility around the car. I love driving it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a '99 Grand Cherokee. Better gas mileage, better rear seat legroom (also a huge improvement over the regular Cherokee's). The mile commute off blacktop gives no issues for me. Cruise control works much better on hilly highways with the CVT over a traditional transmission. Absolutely no regrets thus far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I guess the performance is in the mind of the user. I have owned a Cherokee Sport, a Grand Cherokee Laredo and a Liberty. For value per dollar spent, I'll take the Patriot hands down. I have the 4WD with the CVT and I don't experience the "Performance-robbing" attributes that are described by the reviewer. If jumping on it to merge is your goal, you may want to think about souping up a Neon or Eclipse. I didn't buy any of my Jeeps for their ability to go 0 - 60, that's absurd. I drive them because they are sound and safe vehicles. The ride in my Patriot is smooth as silk and surprisingly quiet. I don't have any problems getting to 70 mph or maintaining it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Was looking at gas sipping little cars and ran across the Patriot. Was shocked to see it gets 28mpg, took a drive and was sold. Had an old Wrangler years back and this thing is like a BMW next to it, very nice and tight ride. Great interior room, and lots of headroom too. You can sit real adults in the backseat, great Jeep looks, and all while getting great gas mileage. We got some bells and whistles in ours and still got it out the door for 15600, don't know how jeep is selling these so cheap. Don't listen to complaints about cheap interior quality, Jeep made it that way so it's easy to clean, it's all wipe off surfaces, cargo area too.

The price and warranty options cinched the deal for us. We are not disappointed! The vehicle is everything and more than we hoped for, it handles well on ice, in snow and extreme cold. We are getting 29 mph, which includes some off road, town and lots of highway driving. It replaces a wonderful Subaru Outback that was getting older.</TEXT>

<TEXT> I have had nothing but a Toyota for 20 plus years until now. After my last Toyota going back to dealer as a lemon, I picked up the Jeep and love. I did not think the ride would come close to a Toyota but it has, and in my view even a little better. I have not heard the so called screaming red line engine noise to get up to speed on the highway, in fact I feel a better performance than my Toyota did. Yes it has the Jeep look and interior, but really not that bad at all. It does feel safe on the road with a good view of what is around you, a problem I had with the Toyota blind spots to the side rear. All in all, I am glad I made the change.</TEXT>

So we got out and looked at the Patriots. After test driving it and talking with the salesman about it we ended up making the purchase. we get about 23 mpg and for an SUV thats pretty good. We got it for approximately $21,000. We love it it drives great you have plenty of room. We purchased it because we have a baby on the way and it has plenty of safety features.

<TEXT> I test drove and now enjoy my trail rated 2008 Patriot. The CVT even as a baby has enough umph to throw our heads back. I currently average over 20mpg city but expect it to improve in a thousand miels or so. Inside is roomy for my tall 200+ self, wife and son's carseat. The ride is very smooth, stable, and quite. Drives better than a base Chevy HHR and better than the Dodge Caliber IMHO. Previously I had a '05 Dakota, it served it's purpose I needed more MPG all though an excellent truck, I wanted something closer to a sedan economy/handling wise but still get off- road.

<TEXT>I needed a solid 4 wheel drive small SUV. I did an extensive comparison with Rav 4 / CR-V / and all the others in this class. no one could touch it for price vs. features. Plus it still has a little German influence, i.e. Pwr assist brakes and anti-roll mitigation. Very solid, quiet and I think, with the leather seats (Ltd) a luxurious interior. I covered the Grey dash surfaces with fake burl wood and it just popped. A very surprising value for the money. Very pleased. I would only like to see the milage improve, and after 1st oil change and a few thou miles, I'm sure it will. You cannot beat this buy anywhere at any price! This is a home run! Toyota and Honda - better go run and hide.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Really nice dual stage heated leather seats. Bluetooth and Sirrus radio for a year! And remote start is fabulous. Solid quiet ride both in town and on the highway. Love the auto stick too.

<TEXT>Out of searching for a good SUV, this one is perfect. I got the D package, because I hate power windows, and remotes, so it saved money. It has 4x4 with the Freedom Drive I CVT2. I bought it for road driving, but got 4wd in case I need to go off-road for something, and for snow and heavy rain. So far, it has been great. It handles very well, and now that I'm getting used to the CVT, has great acceleration. You can really feel the AWD help in daily driving, and the 4wd locking lever is easily accessible So far, been having about 24 mpg on average, with a combination of city and highway driving. This is definitely the vehicle for the more sensible buyer. And best of all, made in USA!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Without a doubt, my favorite feature is the turning radius. This can take such sharp turns, it makes parking it very easy. It's Cherokee-look is great for that little bit of "old school" in me. And, of course, round headlights, which offer very nice lighting. The standard sound system is nice, too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 2008 Patriot is "most excellent". Considering that I got a relatively maxed out 4x4 limited for $23,500, it is truly an outstanding value. I did choose the 5 speed manual over the automatic and am quite pleased with the result. Handling is nimble and I like the Jeep styling. Have logged over 9K miles in less than 6 months. Had one experience in very slippery snow conditions, and found it had better traction than my '94 Grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4. Fuel mileage has been 25 - 28 mpg for combined highway/city driving. The Boston acoustic speakers are outstanding - it is terrific for tailgating. Space utilization is excellent. Like the interior materials and they are easy to keep clean.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this after checking out the Escape and Outback. The Patriot is a much better value and a much better off road and winter vehicle. I special ordered the Sport 4x4 with a manual shift and have been driving in snow pretty much since I got it. The combination of 4WD, stick-shift, and anti-skid mechanism is great - especially for the price I paid. It also has a quiet smooth ride with comfortable front seats. The reason I sold my truck for it though was because I needed better gas mileage. It's great.</TEXT>

Still has side impact airbags, ABS, electronic stablility control, tire pressure alarm light and outside temp guage. A lot of bang for the buck- plus it's a nice Marine blue-very sharp!

Interior is well put together although somewhat outdated in style. I have the manual 5spd and it is probably the smoothest shift I have ever experienced. I also love the idea of the lifetime powertrane warranty. I keep vehicles for at least 10 years.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Manual transmission, ESP, ABS, side airbags, side curtain airbags and 4 and 5 start crash ratings. The cruise control is really easy to use as well. I wasn't thrilled with the YES upholstry to begin with, but it has grown on me and I am starting to appreciate it now. I also prefer its firm seats.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>New Patriot Owner</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I've always been loyal to Jeep and have owned two Wranglers, so when I say the Patriot feels like a luxury SUV keep in mind I don't have much to compare it to. But after just a few days zipping around in this wonderful SUV, I can't believe that some owners are giving it only so-so reviews. I bought the Limited Patriot because I was looking for several things: 4-cylinder, comfortable ride with lots of cool stuff (leather, sunroof, heated seats) and of course it has to be a "real" Jeep. Give the folks at Jeep credit - if they didn't create the Patriot they would have lost me as a long-time customer. I was looking at other small, gas-sipping SUV's like the RAV 4 and the CRV. Not now!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Huge interior. Feels and looks bigger than it is. Quiet ride, lots of cool features and great MPG. I actually smile when I fill up now. It won't win any drag races but the CVT engine isn't that bad. Still shaking my head that I got such a complete SUV for around 25k. Exterior's all Jeep!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall a very nice car. I enjoy driving it around places and it is very rugged. Gone over some medians in some midnight runs and it handles them like a jeep should. (haha) Gas mileage is around 19MPG for me in the city with the AC always on frozen. I really hate the small 13.5 gallon tank for gas, the Honda CRV's tank is 2 gallons bigger! The CVT makes some noise during hard acceleration but overall fairly quiet. The car pulls pretty well around 4K RPMs (torque curve). I don't drive like a grandma which could also point to the less than standard gas mileage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has been wonderful! I've owned it now for 6 months and put about 10,000 miles on it. I've had no mechanical issues with it and it has performed better than expected. I consistently get 25.5 MPG in the city and 26.5 MPH highway. I've never seen less than 24.5 MPH. It is comfortable, easy to reconfigure (fold seats and such), capable and cheap to own and operate. I've got no real drawbacks to this car. It really has met and exceeded all my expectations.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is very capable in the snow and off road, but in the city it is very comfortable and efficient. The interior is well laid out and provides lots of storage space as well as being rugged and easy to clean. It is the smoothest 4 cylinder I've driven and I really like the CVT.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just put 10K on my Patriot and love it. The CVT took about 2 weeks to get used to. Now I enjoy the nice smooth ride the CVT offers. I have a Sport model w/ few options, but it's a Jeep... Who needs options. The interior is simple but very functional and easy to keep clean. The back seats are large enough for my kids 2 car seats. The back seat floor boards are also very deep! Great for that tall friend riding in the back. The storage in the back is a little small but adequate for day to day use. The fold flat seats are awesome. Great for the random Home Depot runs I've made. Can you say MPG's!! Averaging 22-25city and 24-27hwy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love this Jeep!!! After 23,000 miles it drives like new! I'm still smiling! Not a single problem since I bought it new - knock on wood. Have had bmw, benz, jag before so first American vehicle and very surprised and amazed. This Jeep does have some engineering from Benz though which is a bonus! I believe this is the lightest CUV out there and handles beautifully around corners. Salesman said there is not much get up and go from start, only highway speeds was great but I found out both to be great! The lightweight really comes through here and CVT tranny does a great job at keeping shifts very smooth. Dynamics of vehicle is very balanced. Outside size is deceiving to how roomy it is inside.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Height adjustable front YES seats, reclining rear seats, 110 power outlet, CVT transmission, great styling, quiet, comfy ride, quiet engine compared to others, great rear leg room (more than my previous Jag XJ8), best of all - FUN, FUN, FUN TO DRIVE!!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the patriot in may of 08 my parents have one and I liked it. I had mine for about seven months then it stopped shifting from 4th gear to 6th gear. i took it to jeep. They put in a new transmission, wiring harness, and circuits, that still did not fix the problem. They had it for 2 months, and could not fix the problem. They were in the process of buying it back when they went bankrupt. Now i have no jeep and i'm still making payments. Until that point that point it worked great. I drove it to Seattle from Tucson, then from Tucson to Durango, Mexico. Awesome gas mileage. Fun to drive. If I trusted Chrysler I would buy another one in a heart beat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was one of the worst cars we ever bought. It was our 3rd new car purchased. My mom loved the Surf Blue color, so we bought it. The service engine soon light came on twice in 2 weeks, both times it had to be serviced. The tire inflation light came on when the temp was under 50 degrees. We also didn't like it because it set lower than our other SUVs. It also stalled on us at red lights several times. Ours should have been LEMON yellow, instead of blue, we only kept it 5 months.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this new back in June 08 (barebones model) due to needing a new car and money being kinda tight. Ours has no frills except the "pleather" seats. Mostly the wife drives it/took it from me.. LOL.. As she likes the view and having a slightly higher view of the road. Its our first "new" vehicle ever and the lifetime powertrain warranty sold us as did the chassis Jeep look. Ours has the 2.0 and CVT and although its a bit slow its just fine for commuting and all the errands we run. We get 27-30 mpg 50/50 driving. We could not be happier with our purchase to be quite honest. It's very comfortable and has all the room we need, the mp3 stereo is a Nice touch and so is the great mileage.</TEXT>

The first horrible thing I noticed was that if you put down the back window and not the front, your ear drums feel like they'll explode. Lacks power, rough ride - you feel every bump, strong winds feel like they'll blow you over. Wish I wouldn't have bought it. If you don't mind a bumpy ride without much power, then this vehicle will suit you. Never again will I buy a Jeep.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just passed a year since I bought a 2008 Jeep Patriot with 2.4-l, 5-speed manual. I have put 9700 miles on it, probably 70% city driving and 30% towing my fishing boat, a 16-foot boat weighing about 900 lbs. During this time, my grand average MPG has been 28.3. I have only driven out of the city twice without the boat in tow, and both times my MPG has been over 30. My worst tank of gas was in December during near-record snowfall when I was running a lot of third gear, and got 25.9 MPG. There have been no automotive problems with the vehicle. It has good heat and good A/C. The underside of the car looks very good after one winter. </TEXT>

I took our Pat 4x4 straight out on to Oregon Inlet @ N.C. Outer Banks and drove through the thick sand like spreading butter without taking a pound of pressure out of any tires (It's recommended to lower tire PSI to 20 before attempting to traverse through the thick sandy beaches). In my opinion all I can say regarding the Jeep Patriot 4X4 off roading capability is that all 4X4's are limited by physics; however, the Pat's 4X4 off roading capability is up to Jeep standards and is limited by the drivers capability/expertise.

I'm getting 26 mpg which I am pleased with considering the terrain. The brakes are holding up well as as are the Goodyear tires. I bought the base model but wish I had spent the extra money for the 4wd. I thought the front wheel drive would be adequate enough and it basically is but I do miss the 4wd. This vehicle will see well over 200k miles before I trade it for a new one. Love the lifetime powertrain warranty and will definitely consider another patriot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This Jeep is alright at best it drives well enough however they leak very badly and this is a common problem if you go on any forum. Jeep doesn't seem to know how to solve the problem. Having said this it does drive well and has decent power, the interior is comfortable but the dash is very cheap looking plastic which jeep is changing in 2009. The console also heats up quite a lot where the heat adjustment knobs are. This has potential to be a very good vehicle however Jeep has to look at it and fix the design flaws first.</TEXT>

When I let off the gas, the trans mission slips into a lower gear slowing the car down. I suppose it helps save on brake pads, but I really don't care for the feel of it.

<TEXT>From most of the previous reviews owners either rave or rant about their patriot.I have found the vehicle to be trouble free in the 11 months/ 17K of driving i have owned it. The gas mileage is as advertised in 50/50 driving. at 6'3" there is plenty of room in the vehicle. It handles great, has plenty of power for merging without redlining it, the only caveat to this is when it was fully loaded. I have only needed the 4x4 a few times in a record snow fall season in upstate ny. The vehicle is very surefooted and stable in all kinds of weather. the only fit/finish issue i have had is the fan/air direction knobs do not line up with the symbols on dash, small annoyence. Would purchase again</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have logged 21000 miles on this Jeep since March of 2008. Not a single problem. Power and performance are more than adequate for my driving style. My mileage is well within the stated numbers. Often a little better, 30 MPG highway is common for me. The cargo space is good. Lots of room for lumber, dogs, furniture and garage sale finds. This is NOT a Jeep designed for difficult trails and extended off road use. It is excellent for northern climates where snow and ice are common. The car is quiet and comfortable. It is possible to keep the cabin comfortable in temperatures from -20 to 100 degrees. There is some road noise but not excessive. Lets be reasonable, look at the price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Look for the price that you pay, this vehicle is great but there are some drawbacks that you should know about. The first is that the CVT has a serious lag when accelerating from being stopped. The car has great pep when punching it in the 50-70 mph range. I actually like the interior design but I upgraded the seat material etc. The tailgate is low and I crack my head on it like others. The mileage I get is about 24mpg. Even on a full highway trip, I get this b/c the RPS get a little high. Four wheel drive handles great in the snow. All in all a good little car. It isn't great but I would say you get more than what you pay for. The CVT is clearly the thing that needs to be improved.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted to write a review because when I was looking for new car automatic the Edmunds' reviews were very helpful. I scaled down from a minivan to a small SUV, but really the Jeep Patriot is a modern day station wagon. I wanted better gas mileage and am I getting it, averaging 25 mph and on strictly highway 31 mph. That's what should happen with a 2.4 liter 4- cyl. engine, peppy and ride is smooth enough. Went w/out 4x4 to get better mileage. Basic sound system fine. One chip in the paint around the wheel well that's a concern. Since I've only had it a few months I'll try to check back. Status of my extended warranty unsure now but still try to buy American.</TEXT>

I live in the northern part of BC where we get massive amounts of snow every year and haven't got stuck or spun out once. We have nicknamed it the little tank! We can literally go anywhere. I do agree with others that there is a lot of road noise but with 2 kids and a dog we hardly notice. When its time to trade her in I will be looking at Jeep again! </TEXT>

Yes this vehicle is a little noisy and does not drive like our Suburban, but what do you expect?

<TEXT>We have been very happy with our Patriot. The Manual 5 speed gets excellent gas mileage averaging 28mpg and even up to 30. It actually has sufficient power considering its size. You're not going to break any land speed records, but it has enough power loaded down to get over both passes from western Colorado to Denver without being stuck behind the semis. The patriot is a great value for the money especially with all the options and the safety features. The only downfalls have been having to take it in to repair a the left turn signal that stopped canceling itself, as well as it being a little hesitant to engage in reverse while facing downhill. Cons are outweighed by the pros if it lasts.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's a nice affordable SUV for a first time car buyer. It does lack a little of the "vroom" factor, but makes up for it with a nice smooth drive after the initial get up and go part. The interior is a little plasticky, but makes for easy cleaning and really grows on you actually. If you're driving mostly city/highway and not looking to go mudding, great SUV for your buck. Plenty of console storage. All in all, on a budget but need the room and style, great SUV.</TEXT>

The PCM went in the vehicle and the trans still doesn?t shift correctly. When you drive it the engine constantly revs to 6.5 rpm while which gives 16 mpg highway. 23 to 28 mpg that?s a laugh. It?s a lemon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This Jeep has been a headache since I got it. My Jeep Patriot came to me from the factory with a faulty crank and sensor, so, every morning I get to hold my breath as I listen to the thing crank for 10-15 seconds before finally turning over. I think to myself, is this the day it is not going to start, every morning! It will be going to see a certified Chrysler dealer for the third time to fix this issue! wish me luck! On top of that, there is something wrong with the gas gauge and i ran out of gas on the highway because I got about 5 miles after the fuel light went on. One headache after the next with this Jeep Patriot and I had such high hopes. buyers beware!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car because most of my driving is the Urban Jungle, but my weekends often involve kayaks on the roof. This is a great for driving around town scoring around 25 mpg. Load her down for a trip and highway miles drop to about 19mpg (maintaining speed even on hills) Say about 22 mpg if you don't mind dropping about 10 mph climbing hills or not using cruise control. The gearing of the CVT pushes my last nerve anytime I leave the city. If you have a lead foot or drive aggressively, this isn't the car for you. Off the pavement (long shot from "off-road") this little guy handles well, minus the rattling in the steering column. Would be the perfect vehicle for me with a V6 and no CVT.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 33,000 miles, I traded in my '07 Caliber for this '08 Patriot, so I was used to the interior layout (though the Jeep is a little roomier) and the CVT. I agree that you sacrifice some "get up and go" for the gas mileage, but in these days of $4.00 a gallon gas, I think the trade off is well worth it. Prior to the Caliber, I had an '05 Equinox. The Equinox was a little too large for my needs, and the Caliber was a little too small, but the Patriot is just right! I feel like the Patriot fills a niche that no other compact SUV does - it's an SUV, just smaller; not a "cute 'ute" like everything else in its class.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I live in the suburbs but I routinely go hiking, so a suv was a must. This is my first new car to buy so I wanted something inexpensive but capable. First off for a v-4 its more powerful than any v-6 Ive owned, the pick up is surprisingly good. The handling is also superb, especially for a suv. The tank is small but the mpg is as good as some cars, let alone a suv. I am very pleased with all performance aspects of this Jeep. Yes the interior is sparse and the electronics not good at all. But that's not why I got a Jeep. I got it for its performance on and off road. Compared to other suvs which are mainly for suburbs, the patriot blows them away (comparing to my sisters escape on a dirt road)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the Patriot for a few months and absolutely love it. I bartered down big time, so they gave me a very BASIC package but I'm not looking for luxury. I drive 80 miles round trip to work, daily, and couldn't be happier. My AVERAGE mileage has been 30+ MPG. Throw in the lifetime FULL warranty, I'm comforted by the fact if anything busts, it's covered (well worth the exta few bucks a month). Rides great, TONS of room (I'm 6'1 and don't even have the seat all the way back easily can handle someone even taller). Plan on easily adding on features later DIY transmission cooler and hitch, can tow 2000 lbs. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the vehicle that America needed. A 4 wheel drive Jeep that gets 30 MPG, and is high on American made content. I now have 12,000 miles on my Patriot and I have loved every mile of my driving experience. The low price is reflected throughout the vehicle, but if you like older Jeeps, that is a good thing. Interior is mostly easy clean plastic. Instrumentation is clear and comprehensive. The square design of the Patriot provides an impressive amount of cargo space. Seats are comfortable. Rear seating is spacious for adults, but let a kid sit in the middle. The car is rated at 28 but I get as high as 32 on the highway. 20 in strictly city driving. 4 cylinder engine is plenty powerful.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the 5 speed manual transmission. It is fun to drive and gets about 4 MPG better than my Wife's Compass with the CVT. I was attracted by the classic Jeep exterior styling which is echoed in the square, spartan interior appointments. 4 wheel drive is easy to use and does not rob mileage numbers</FAVORITE>

Very comfortable, as nice if not better than the grand, little smaller, nicer handling and driving, found the 5 speed to have plenty of power. True 4x4 will be nice for upstate NY. Front seat folds flat for super storage if needed (great option) patriot really is impressive. I like the interior (despite what the big boys say) this is the 6th Jeep we have owned.

It should be standard to have the Information Center on the dash I am very disappointed with that mine didn't come with that. I would like to see a Glass Panoramic sunroof too that would be cool and some more interior lighting preferably under the dash, and the tach lighting is dim make them a little brighter white is the new color for gauges. and a wood dash option with black leather, the two tone leather looks tacky.</TEXT>

The fold down front pass. seat allows you to haul 8' long items. The only thing a bit small is the rear cargo area width and height. But I knew that going in. I get 23 to 25 in mixed driving. I am not heavy footed and I don't see doing much better. Speeds over 70 and heavier loads drop the mpg. I think you can get 27-28 at 50-55 mph. Like the looks and convenience features of the limited.

<TEXT>I thought the Patriot was well-equipped for the price so I purchased one last week. I was very happy with my purchase for the first 24 hours, but I would soon discover the lift gate does not lock. Patriot lift gates only lock electronically (no keyhole).The dealership discovers the factory installed the wrong wiring and the dealer doesn't have the part. That requires a second trip. Of course, Chrysler/Jeep doesn't reimburse you for the fuel you burn or your time you spend fixing their factory mistake. They gave me a loaner car for 24 hrs (which is cool) but you have to refill the tank upon return (not cool). Seriously, Jeep(or the dealer) needs to step up more if you find a defect on day one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I specifically purchased the Patriot to help save on fuel costs. I should have stayed with my old car. It costs a little more to fill up per week but had a bigger tank. When merging into traffic, I always need to look over my shoulder to check traffic due to the blind spots. There are only 4 cup holders in this car, and no coin holder. I feel like they didn't think anything through before getting this car out to the public. I wouldn't recommend this car to anyone.

<TEXT>I did a lot of shopping before deciding on the Patriot. Having owned SUVs for years, it was a totally new experience shopping for an SUV based on gas mileage, and good mileage at that! Thus far, the mileage is excellent, and has given me no reason to believe that the estimated mileage on the sticker will not be accurate after break-in. The CVT was a bit different for the first few miles, but it didn't take long to not even notice it. Now I love the fact that you have no negligible shift. Acceleration is amazing for a 2.0 Liter! Driver visibility is excellent, everything seems to be just where I want it, and I like the interior. This vehicle is just what I was looking for.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Driver visibility. The vehicle seems far bigger than it actually is sitting in the drivers seat, and the view all around is excellent. I love the cloth seats, which are not hot on our 95 degree days. Also, we can seat five comfortably. The mileage, which is awesome. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We got the Patriot to replace a Honda Element. So far, we have mostly good things to say about it. Where we live, we routinely get heavy snows, and even with Freedom Drive I we have no problems. The upgraded sound is amazing, the sunroof is well worth the $800, and the YES! seats are perfect for our 10-month-old. Our big complaint is that there's not very much cargo space, especially with a baby in the back seat. I guess that's what you get with a small SUV, though. I also wish the liftgate lifted higher. I'm 5'11 and I hit my head all the time. So far we get something in the 25-26 mpg range, but we drive up a 2000-foot hill once or twice a day, which kills the mpg. Overall we're pleased.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MPG. Jeep styling. YES! seats. Lifetime powertrain warranty Sirius. The fact that you can buy a 4wd SUV with a sunroof, all the options, and premium sound for under $20k.

<TEXT>Bought this vehicle while I was in Iraq through military buying program.

I took a bit of a "plunge" and bought it strictly on consumer ratings, vehicle magazine ratings (other than CR), and people such as you giving honest feedback on these sites. Got a great deal and bought a Sport 4x4, CVT transmission, electronic package. I have been driving it for a month now and it exceeds my expectations! I was concerned about a 4-cylinder engine, but more than enough power to get around. I heard some cons about the CVT, but not an issue...works very well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Patriot has been great. The most off road and on road performance in a go almost any where package. If you want 27/30 mpg get the fwd manual. For off road purchase the Freedom Drive II with 4x4 low the Trail Rated version. It can ford water just 1" lower than the wrangler. The MPG off road and at the beach is 17 mpg where other suv/trucks get 6/10 mpg. Flat highway will get 23/24 mpg if you nurse the gas peddle. The pedal is your mpg control. If you want sport driving get the Auto Stick but no 4x4 low with the Auto Stick. I drives like a compact wagon on road. Very sporty for an SUV.

<TEXT>I bought this to replace a Ford F150, and have NOT been disappointed. I average about 27 mpg with mixed driving out in the country. The acceleration is great, although not really outstanding, it is much more than I need. Overtaking is easy with the Patriot going from 45 to 75+ in almost a blink of an eye. The CVT really does a great job of giving the power when it's needed. And though I don't have the Trail-Rated version, even during a major ice storm this past Winter, the Jeep handled inclines and roads that even pickups with off-road packages couldn't handle. It's nimble, and very comfortable.</TEXT>

It looks rugged and it's sharp. It was not love at first sight for me at all, until I decided to buy it because of the great deals that I couldn't resist. I've always been a fullsize type of guy - was looking at a Dodge Ram 4x4. It's still too new for the engine to break in to get the best fuel mileage and to see it's true reliability down the road.

<TEXT>If you're looking for the best value in an SUV, the Patriot is it. I researched buying a car for about 8 months, reading all the reviews, going on test drives, etc. Nothing else could compare to the low cost and great gas mileage: 24 mpg combined average fuel economy in a 4x4 at under 17K. You can't beat that anywhere. Overall, the Patriot is really for people like me who would prefer a no frills, basic car at a great price. If you like more comfort and amenities and are willing to pay for it, obviously this SUV isn't for you. </TEXT>

The armrest that the driver and passenger are to share could be larger. Overall, I like my Patriot. It reminds me of the Cherokee, just smaller. I will add my children ages 6 and 9 commonly refer to our new car as a "box on wheels". Unfortunately it's too early to tell what problems will be in our future. I'm hopeful that it will not follow the pattern of the last 3 Chrysler products I have purchased which at 80,000 miles needed a new transmissions. Overall I would recommend the Patriot.

<TEXT>We took the Patriot back the first week because of a strange sound from under the front of the car. Service said it did not do this for them but other buyers had experienced the problem on a national level. One month later the sound got louder, including a vibration on the floorboard. We are waiting to hear what can be done. We loved the car at first but we never got the good gas mileage and believe it has something to do with that intermittent sound. It happens in all types of driving situations, stepping on the gas, breaking, turning. You might drive a few miles before hearing it or just out the driveway. We wonder if anyone else has had this happen? </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've recently purchased the new 2008 Jeep Patriot Sport 4x2 (2.0 L Engine 6SPD), and I have no regrets! It's built to take 87 Octane gas, which is great by the way especially in our current economic status, and it is fast for a 2.0 liter! My Patriot comes with 158 HP and I can't wait to add an intake and performance chip. It handles well and surprisingly superior on curves. I'm an SUV person and all the previous SUVs I've had have been gas consuming and poor handlers. The Jeep Patriot is stable enough with a wonderful ground clearance.

Took to dealer and they ended up replacing transmission. Besides this very happy with vehicle. MPG is 31-32 on highway 27 around town. Ugly rims, I plan to replace when I need tires with aftermarket. Interior is cheap plastic that scratches easily but I knew this before buying. I got a nice 4wd SUV with 4WD and upgraded sound system and trailer prep package and engine block heater and 26E group for under 18k out the door so I am still happy with my purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This Jeep is an excellent example of American craftsmanship. I have put over 4 thousand miles on my Jeep and have owned it only five weeks. I plan to take it up to Michigan over July fourth weekend. I have the base model with the smaller engine. The Patriot is not fast, but handles nicely after about 20 mph. It is slow to start off the line. The CVT is neat, different is good. The engine does produce an incredible amount of noise, but only when driving aggressively. I can cruise in complete silence at 75 mph, but then the tires from the factory start screaming. I've read that changing tires can eliminate the noise. This is my second new vehicle, and third vehicle over all and it's the best.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like that the vinyl seats look like leather. Several different people have asked me why I got the leather seats and crank windows. I tell them that I really just prefer the cranks. CVT. MPG, high 28.8 low 25.6 Ext style. Very roomy, I'm 6ft. 4 in. and can extend my legs all the way. AMERICAN MADE!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>While driving on the freeway it moves, I think it's out of alignment; it almost wants to fish tail. As I start to press on the bake it makes a noise, not only that it makes a clank sound underneath. I took it back to have it serviced, but it still moves, suddenly it pulls to the right. This is not a safety car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Patriot. I bought it brand new in November of 2007 for $19,000 out the door (cash). I have about 8,000 miles on it now. It's a little underpowered, but it helps get good better MPG. The interior plastic doesn't really bother me that much, but it is a little uncomfortable for your arms/elbows on a long drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Jeep look, two-tone leather is a great addition, great sound system (even w/o the upgraded system), I've been getting about 22+ MPG so far (mostly city w/ a little hwy)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only had the Patriot for two weeks, but I already know I made a good decision in picking this vehicle. I looked at several comparable models including the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, Nissan Rogue, and Ford Escape. Those are all nice vehicles, but seemed to be somewhat overpriced compared to the features of the Patriot. I bought the Sport 4x4 with the CVT transmission. With only 650 miles, I'm getting 27 MPG on the hwy, which is 3 MPG above the EPA rating. Combined is 23 MPG. Seat comfort is good considering there is no power option. Plenty of leg room front and rear. Build quality is very good. Anyone looking at a small SUV should consider this one. Check out the forums on the Patriot.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, fold down and reclining rear seats, easy to clean YES fabric.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first SUV and was kind of worried about the insurance and the gas, but after calling and found out that the insurance was half the price of my other car bad up for the 3mpg difference of what I was getting in my car. I drive 80 miles round trip to work and find it very comfortable. I bought this suv for myself, but my husband drives it more then me. I think it is time to buy him one now. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CD player, tinted windows, flashlight, garage door opener, well the whole thing really. I love it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought it on 3-30 (traded in a Dodge Ram) and totaled it on 5-6. Bounced off guard rail at 65 mph and did not have a single scratch. Has to say something about safety. We love this car so much that we are buying another one today.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leg and head room. I am 6'2" and my wife is 5'9" and have plenty of room. Great on gas and love the vinyl seats and cargo floor. I go to construction sites and can just hose of the GA red clay.</FAVORITE>
