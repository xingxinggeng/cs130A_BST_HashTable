<TEXT>I've had my Cobalt a little over a year now, its a fun little car, but ii was expecting more from it. I added new rims/tires and a new exhaust because the appearance was somewhat plain. The inside looks really cheap, Chevy needs a major upgrade on the interior. I have yet to see the mileage Chevy says it gets, a little frustrating. I'd say its a good beginner car, but not really able to compete with other cars in the same category, it just falls short.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the back end of the car, very eye catching, and the gauges are nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Definitely has the 'fun-to-drive' factor! For my first car, I'd say it was a tasty pick. Test drove it before I even got to a Scion TC and immediately fell in love. Easy to drive, looks sharp after being washed- especially with tinted windows. Only problem I ever had was running the stereo too long without the car being turned on so the battery died, easy jump though. Plastic grille on the front popped out once, but I stuck it back in. Turning signal sticks. Parking brake cable sticks out on the bottom as well. No big deal. Overall I still love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration, power everything, mp3 jack, trunk space, sunroof, spoiler/overall body style, fog lights, information display.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got it as a rental for work. Pulls hard to the left. Tire pressure is good though. Vibrates when braking as if a rotor is warped. Not acceptable for a car with only 30k miles and built in April of 2008. I don't expect it to last as long as my 1992 Sentra.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CD Player and sound system has aux in for my iPod. Good bass response from the speakers. I also like the trip computer which allows you to instant gas mileage and tire pressures. Steering wheel cruise control is nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was expecting better fuel economy. But I only get about 25mpg avg (city and hwy). It's a fun car to drive, and I'll likely put some work into it once the warranty is up, but for now it has little power and poor mileage. Spend the little extra for the LT. I regret that I didn't.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the radio included. XM, mp3/wma, and how it does it's presets. Its neat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in a 2007 GMC 4x4 pickup due to a job transfer and a 60 mile a day drive to and from work. Took a while to get use to smaller size, I am a 6'2" man, but after a week it is comfortable. Mileage is super, 28 mpg average with spirited driving. Ride comfort is great with SS seats. Handles like it is on rails. Turbo 4 cylinder is fun, runs better than most V8's. To bad GM is stopping production, this car puts a smile on your face.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Cobalt a year ago and still LOVE it! I had always driven v8's so was a little concerned about going to a 4 cyl, but was very surprised with how much power it actually has. It also handles very well. I live on back country roads and it takes curves wonderfully. Plenty of trunk space makes traveling easy. Also has a GREAT stereo system. The remote start is also great for warming up or cooling down the interior before getting. The back seat is a little tight though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am sad to say that I just had an accident in my March 2008 Cobalt. My Cobalt and a Mini Van collided at very low speeds and my car had $7,700 worth of damage. I could not believe how bad the damage was for low speeds of under 25mph. Air bags did not deploy. It was at a residential intersection. I have another 4 years to pay on this having taken out a 5 year loan. I am very upset about it all. I will not buy another Cobalt if they should be available. </TEXT>

<TEXT>A tall order to stack up against my '75 Civic, but Detroit has finally come abreast of Honda--not to win, of course, but at least place or show. At $9999 this basic model had just what I wanted, including a tight 5-speed manual trannie, almost as buttery smooth as Honda. (Power windows are over-rated anyway.) The caster is a bit too strong, the steering ratio is a bit too sharp, and the steering wheel is a bit too small, so it won't drive itself like a Civic. If you're making a sharp right, be advised to keep a firm grip on the wheel, 'cause it will snap back in the direction it's pointing in a hot lick. But Hey, it's from Detroit! I started with a '49 Chevy, and I'm back home.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Performance: 2.2L ECOtec with the 5sp. is a very quick engine for what it is. A+ on the engine. Suspension needs work, too soft in the corners but smooth ride. The rear drums on mine constantly need adjustment. Comfort: I just drove from Ohio to Wyoming and back non-stop and had no problems with comfort. Fuel: For some reason, the higher the RPM's the worse my mileage... still get 26-7 Driveability: This car is a blast for what it is. Design:Exterior looks excellent except for the lame front bumper. Interior is well constructed and looks good but cheap materials were used. Build: Definitely built well Reliability: A couple minor things needed replaced but covered by warantee NICE CAR!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have already reviewed my 2008 Cobalt LS sedan once, but I thought folks might appreciate an update. I have now owned the car almost ten months, and I have 15,150 miles on it. The car has performed flawlessly, and I have not had a single issue with it. I am getting about 27 or 28 MPG overall average, which is not too bad in my opinion for an automatic. I live in a rural area, and my driving is mostly on hilly, curvy, two lane country roads and in town. I am still amazed by how that little Cobalt will scoot! That 2.2L engine is amazingly powerful. I am extremely happy with the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Cobalt and 11 days later, it was in the shop.I have had the car 15 months, and it has been in the shop 6 times for manufacture defects. Just this week, the lock cylinder broke. It's a good thing I was at work and not stuck in a dim parking lot at night.The steering column, the shift assembly, and the lock cylinder have all been replaced. I am waiting on the new radio to come in, which will actually be the 4th radio. The blinkers and front speakers will not work right if your radio is messed up. Very bad blindspots, when trying to look over your shoulder. Poorly designed overall.Fuel mileage, not that great. Brakes don't last.Chevy, quit making this piece of junk! It's not reliable!!!!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my '08 LT sedan last May. I've put 10k miles on it so far and it has been a pretty good car to drive. It's handled very well in the ice and snow recently. The remote start option has been good this winter with having an infant. Driving a mix of city and highway, I tend to get about 28 mpg. That was nice while gas prices were up. Even now that gas is back down its still wonderful not to have to spend as much on gas. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have an LT package XFE (5M), so I've got the electric windows and the center armrest. The car is quiet, handling is solid as a rock even at high speeds, and the hard seats are comfortable on long trips. Trunk room is spacious, but the opening is small. The 2.2 will scoot if you wind it up, which you can do with the manual transmission. This is a great car, lots of fun to drive, plenty of front seat room, and great mileage. Under the skin, the Cobalt is an Opel Astra, so if you like the personality of German cars, you'll like this one. For the price that Chevy sells them for, it's a bargain.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power and handling are superb. XM radio is a pleasant standard feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the 2008 Cobalt because fuel at the time of purchase was at the all time high. So far I do like the vehicle, but it is terrible in snow and ice but most vehicles this size probably are. I have experienced premature wear on the drivers seat at 5000 miles and 6 months service. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car for my 18 year old daughter for her high school graduation. She loved it and we loved the cost. Last Sunday she had an accident on the highway in which she hit some black ice. Smashed into a wall. And than the car rolled over landing on the roof. She was wearing her seatbelt. Thank God. Without a scratch she gets out of the car. Calls me first and than called 911. I arrived before the emergency services and she was sittinbg on the side of the road with out a scratch on her. Needless to say that after the insurance pays off I will be getting her another Cobalt. This car did a great job in protecting my kid and it will do the same for yours, buy American. All in all I cant thank Chevy caring enough and not cheaping out on the safety aspect of this little economy car </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. For being a young female it's great, a lot better than my old Escort. It does need a little help though. I don't have a lot of rear seat passengers but they could've given the rear more leg room. Very roomy in front. Only problem I'm having is with the brakes. Yes, after 6500 miles the rotors got warped. Composite rotors with semi metallic pads don't combine well. It's a nice little car for me, rides smooth (other than the brake issue), good on gas and comfy for a tall person like me. Decent style outside for the price. I paid for what I got. Not much to complain about with it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>XFE (5 speed) is tuned for highway driving. Flat terrain at 58mpg = 38-42mpg. Subtract 4-5 mpg for air conditioner! Poor in town mpg (23-26). Not good for stop and go commuting in a hot climate. Enjoy XM radio. Good seat adjustments (up/down, back-forth, tilt-lumbar). Chevy. Get rid of Coupe design. Dangerous, cannot see out of back, especially with worthless spoiler. Change to hatchback. Trunk is deep, but opening is miniscule. Can't even put a standard cooler chest in it. Poor access to rear seats. Also Chevy failed to support the XFE sedan. Could not find 1 in the whole US! Corporate didn't know either. Inexcusible. No wonder they are bankrupt!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car nearly 7 months ago, and it has completely surpassed my expectations. I am just over 6 feet tall, and of all the small cars I tested this one felt the most comfortable to me. It is extremely fun to drive, and even with my heavy foot, I average about 28 mpg in town, and have gotten as much as 38 on the highway. I would highly recomend this car to anyone looking for an econobox that is a kick to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Given the extremely low sticker price, I don't see how anyone with reasonable expectations could be disappointed with a Cobalt. I bought my LS 4 Dr Sedan with auto tranny on June 3, 2008. The sticker price was only $15,530, with the auto tranny and the spoiler being the only options. There was also a $2000 rebate at the time. I cannot believe what a sweet little car that Cobalt has turned out to be, especially considering the low sticker price. I bought the car purely for fuel economy, but I ended up with a car that is really fun to drive. It has amazing acceleration for a gas sipper, a quiet ride, a huge trunk, good handling, and great looks. I am totally pleased with this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car to drive to work and school. Bought it brand new. Previously owned a Chevy Lumina for many years. I think the best indicator in do you really like your car is, Would you buy it again? My answer to this one is an absolute NO. I disliked this car so much that after two months of owning and 3000 miles later, I traded it in on a used Subaru. The Cobalt is just another version of the Yugo. At least that's how I felt when driving. Everything in the Cobalt looks and feels cheap, like it wasn't very well thought out. My new line is "I would rather drive a used Subaru than a brand new Cobalt."</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the car to get me from point A to point B safely and it does just that. I've kept my foot off the gas and manage about 33-34 to the gallon for an average. The car handles well, I have power when I need it. It is fairly comfortable considering that I am six one and I drive a couple hours solid every day to get to work. I don't even hit my head on the roof. Only problem I have had is the bolts that hold on the front bumper started to go loose after 6500 miles with half the miles spent on dirt roads.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only put on 2100 miles and am pleased with how the vehicle runs and the fuel mileage. It is the basic lowest cost Cobalt XFE sedan with air and manual tranny. At 75mph average on the freeway, it will deliver 34 mpg +/- 3mpg depending on with the wind or against. Has turned in 39.7mpg on 160 mile trip driving at 60 mph on freeway. Vehicle was purchased as a run around unit with trips not longer than 3 hours thus comfort (i.e. as in our Town & Country Van) was not a priority. It has fairly predictable handling with a quiet ride and is not buzzy as was found with some small foreign vehicles in this size. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love to mess around with the onboard computer information. Instant mpg, avg mpg, outside temp, tire pressure, trip A and trip B odometer, engine temp, and average MPH. Also like the XM radio but am undecided as to cost per month for it. Car is quiet running and fit and finish is good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Cheaply made. Interior is uncomfortable and made of substandard materials. Visibility out the back window is horrid. It angles upward so you don't get a clear view of what is behind you. For everyday commuting in a flat area it is a fine car. It performs horridly in hilly areas and mountains. Definitely does not handle winding roads well as it does not hug the road on turns. I am trading this in for a either a Ford Focus or a Toyota Corolla.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall the new SS is an amazing car for the money and outperforms many cars with much higher price tags. It's really fun to drive. Finally they got it right, everything you would expect in a SS labeled car. Not for those who just want a little sporty car, you'll soon be bothered by the many clicks, clunks and less refined aspects of this performance car. Fuel mileage sold me on this car and I'm not disappointed, averaging 27mpg mixed driving. A cool feature lets you see your instant mileage approx when trying to stretch those mpg's. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Best feature is the traction control and performance mode shifting. Cars are made to turn and corner, no doubt this little car can handle more than you'd expect.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I first stepped into the car I thought it was roomy - I'm 6'6". The seats were very fitting and finally a head rest that met the back of my head. The SS has everything you want - power across the board, not the seats though. Side airbags and a great steering wheel. I wish I had a manual telescoping option, but it's 20K so go figure. If I wanted wood on the dash and in the car, I should be in the backseat ala S500-EL or a Cadillac Deville-EL. I would recommend getting a two tone interior; red/black for victory red, gray/black for the sport tint - very nice combo's</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine is a marvelous. The injector's spray fuel into the piston's at around 2000PSI, vs a normal engine at 50-80psi. The turbo, handling and stereo are all great. This would be a great commuter car, but I use it as a grocery getter, around town etc.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car as a replacement to a 1993 Audi. I drive a lot and needed good fuel economy. I have almost 5000 miles on the car and my calculated mpg is 37.4. The headrests are uncomfortable from the factory (they tip my head forward), but they are easily reversed and quite comfortable when reversed. It is a little tight with 2 teenage boys in the back, but they can make it work. It handles well. It has good acceleration and cornering. I was a little afraid of the low rolling resistance tires, but they seem to perform well. The stereo is adequate, but lacks fidelity in the bass. I suggest the XFE version over the standard. Its performance seems about the same. Minor lines mismatch on hood</TEXT>

<TEXT>I own a 2008 Chevrolet Cobalt Sedan. I like the car for the most part, one thing that worries me is the brakes stink. When the car had just over 4000 miles on it I began to notice really odd noises when braking, took it in they said it was the hubcap. It did it on the drive home. Took it in again at 4500 miles and got new brake pads put on they said they must be factory defects. Well it started again at 5500 miles then just the other I day I hit the brakes on the highway and they immediately locked up. I like the car but the brake problems worry me a little bit, I had a Chevy Malibu prior to this and never had a problem with the brakes ever.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got the 2LT coupe in black with the appearance package, so it looks like a sport or SS, but sadly doesn't handle or perform quite the same. I definitely prefer performance and handling over the interior styling or comfort, but I also want the car to look good, and my Cobalt does both. It has response, even when compared to my old Volvo 850 Turbo. The handling is smooth, which makes this car fun on back country roads. My mom has the sedan sport, and even though she has the Pioneer speakers, mine still get super loud and have excellent bass. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned this just about a month, and can't believe how much money I have already saved! Can't beat it, Great MPG: 38 hiway, 33 city so far, great trunk space than orginally thought, enough pep, seats are more comfortable..and I got the manual which I had not driven in over 20 years, and was very comfortable. I would recommend this as a good value for the money. Looked at Astra, but would have spent extra 4k. Only con, maybe more nooks and crannies, for little things i.e coins, sunglasses, etc. Other than that very, very happy with this purchase. And even enough back seat room in 4dr sedan!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I overall love my little Cobalt. I bought a brand new 2008 Cobalt LT coupe, and now have 1,500 miles on it. I recently got it to 41 MPG average on the highway with the cruise control on. I got 0% interest for 60 months, so it was a smart buy too. I always liked the Cavaliars, but these feel less cheap, and more roomy. I got the dark Blue Metallic, and it really sparkles. The color is my favorite part, but hard to keep clean. I would have opted for the darker seats too, I got my light seats sprayed with a special scotch guard type spray with a warranty to keep the interior looking nice. Spoiler makes it dangerously hard to see out of back, but love the ways it makes the exterior look. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM radio (free 90 day trial), information button that tells you average MPG, two trip sets, tire pressure, outside temp, how many miles til your out of gasoline etc. Quiet ride. Fold down seats perfect for snowboards. Keyless entry, car finder (push alarm button for 1 second, and car will honk 3x)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have always owned Dodges or Fords. Never liked Chevys. I test drove every vehicle made in this class. This had the best ride, best fuel mileage,, smoothest operation, and best price. With factory incentives the car cost $12,100. I was very objective and simply couldn't pass up this great car. I liked the size of some others like the Scion XB but the ride was harsh and jiggly, gas pedal operation was abrupt. The Chevy is way easier to drive. We have them in our fleet at work and the mechanics say they are the most reliable cars we have ever owned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Cobalt last February. I originally wanted a VW Rabbit but after a bit of sticker shock ($17,000) I decided to keep things basic. With incentives and deals, my Cobalt was $12,500 out the door. I have no options but CD/mp3/auxillary jack and air condition were standard. I just drove from Detroit to Chicago and averaged 37 mpg by going 65 and easing of the gas pedal when going up hill. It's not as nice as the foreign competition, but I saved thousands on the car. The warranty is decent too. And I kept Americans employed with my purchase. Long live Detroit!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the auxilliary jack on the radio and the standard a/c does a good job. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently purchased an 08 Cobalt LS brand new after owning a 1999 Chrysler Sebring Lxi Conv. for 9 months. That car stunk, but this car is great so far. I love the handling and the acceleration, even for an automatic like mine. For a 4 popper, you simply cannot beat it. The car is stylish and bold with many nice features. The engine sounds like a Honda. What blew me away was, however, the performance. I thought that it would have decent acceleration and good handling, but this car, even being the basic LS model, has terrific performance. Driving home from the lot I wanted to try it out, and a guy in a tricked out 07 GTI wanted to go and he enjoyed a view of my tailpipe.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Instrument gauge features, performance, XM satellite. Again, bang for buck, you get a steal when it comes to performance. I can only imagine what the SS package would bring to the table. I also really like the cargo room in the back. In my opinion, it is plenty large. Averaging 34 mpg</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The SS has received good if not excellent reviews. I had to drive it myself. After comparing the SS to other's in it's class, it's American built perfomance won it for me. Priced under 25,000 the SS is great bang for the buck. I've only driven mine for a few hundred miles and it has delivered all I have expected. Acceleration, handling and braking have all come easily from the well bolstered bucket seats. Each element of the vehicle has been well thought out from ergonomics to perfomance, nothing seems out of place or missing. From bumper to bumper this vehicle has delivered. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got the car and love driving it. The best smooth drive (Civic & Vesra horrible to me) and nice handling. My only negative is you cannot shoot into traffic with it. Nice standard and satellite radio with MP3 hook up. Bought for my teenager but I enjoy driving it. Great price for the money. I could not beat it. Not sure of the gas mileage yet..

<TEXT>Runs great, got the basic model but comes well equiped without costly options. Sure it may not be as good as a Honda or Toyota, but costs thousands less. Doesn't get as good gas economy as imports but that's due to more powerful engine. Just drive easy and you will get good economy. After 2 yrs bought another one for another family member.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a car under 15k, and I knew I was going to be giving up a lot to get it. This would be my daily commuter. After pricing a Civic, 3, Corrolla, and Focus I knew I was in trouble. Wasn't really looking at GM until I saw a Cobalt. I have seen them before but never really paid attention. Took it for a drive and was overly impressed. Got an LT and with options it was 4k less than a Civic with the same options. I love this car more and more, and with the rebates you can't beat the value. Very well built car. I would seriously consider this in lieu of the forementioned cars I was considering unless you are hung up on a name like Honda. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just wanted to say that the Cobalt is a great car. I have had it for about 3 months and I put about 6000 miles on it and I have had no problems. Car runs great and handles well. And for a 4cyl it has some pick up. I do city and highway driving and I am getting an avg of around 30 mpg. When I am on the highway I am getting at least 35 mpg. I wish I would have known the Cobalt XFE was coming out. I would have waited because if I am getting 35 mpg on the highway with the reg Cobalt, the XFE has to be getting atleast 40 mpg on the highway. For around $12,500 you cant go wrong! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I really love this car, love the look, enjoy the feel of it while driving, having OnStar has been fun- and my daughter loves usign the OnStar phone. Plenty of room for the family dog in the back seat as well. In sport read this car was my idea of a fun car! I get 27.5 miles per gallon using the interstate between home and work, I am very disappointed in the gas mileage. I use cruise control every day and I never get more than 27.5- some folks say they are getting 400 miles out of 11 gallons Yeah I'd like to see that done in person, you have to see it to believe it. Other than the gas issue at 4.12 per gallon I really love this little car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted a "fun little car". Looked for a 5 speed, and all of the Ford dealers told me to buy one, to test drive one. I found a Cobalt sport litterally 'round the corner. It was the demo of a salesman we just bought an Impala from. He litterally threw me the keys, and told me to take it for a "thrashing". Lots of fun, and good mileage. handles like a race car, and if I keep my foot out of it, I get over 34 mpg. I'm 53, and some kid in an Acura wanted to race, I laughed, and when the light turned green, I laughed. I blew him away. Only item I do not like, is the arm rest. can't get to the parking brake, and the design could be better. I can't imagine the performance of the turbo. </TEXT>

It's a quick little beast, I've had Civics trying to match up and I leave them looking at my rear end. It's a nice spoty vehicle with good gas mileage and comfty smooth ride.

<TEXT>Traded in a Jeep Liberty that was getting 13mpg, just couldn't handle it. Was also shopping Saturn Astra, but dealer and factory incentives were too good. Sticker price was 23k paid just over 19k out the door. Manual transmission is a joy to drive with short throws and positive engagement. Engine has good power and torque, although not the quickest revving or smoothest sounding one out there. Fuel economy is outstanding! 28.8 mpg first tank, in a 60% city 40% hwy mix. Very quiet on the inside even with sunroof, also the ride is very comfortable even with sport suspension. Handling is sporty and fun. Seats are comfortable and supportive. Good trunk space.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent balance of power and handling with fuel economy and comfort. 30mpg, good cabin materials and attention to detail, looks more expensive than it really is, supportive seats w/ lumbar adjustment, saftey features (side cutain airbags, antiskid system, etc.,) manual transmission. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've bought the Cobalt LT for it's good equipment package for the price especially the cruise control and a/c. I think the Cobalt is one of the best keept secrets from GM. The fuel efficiency is better than what GM says. I can do an average of over 650 km with 42-43 litters of fuel 70% highway 30% city (400 miles for 11 us gallons) The ride quality is excellent, very silent inside the car. The room for head is a lot better than my Honda Civic. The 2.2 motor had a lot of power for a subcompact car and a lot more torque than its competitiors. If I had to buy a new car I will re-buy the Cobalt LT for the price vs quality and the warranty 5y/160 000 km </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the onboard computer with a lot of interesting features like the average fuel consuption, the outside temperature, the oil change calculator. The Canadian LT models have a lot of equipment: elect window, a/c, tilt steering, cruise control, keyless entry, and especially a good fuel economy </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The last GM car I had was a company issued 2002 Cavalier. So I was vehemently against another GM product when shopping for a new work vehicle. Until I drove the Cobalt. Now I know that I am not going to be scaring any WRX or EVO owners on the roads, but as far as getting from A to B with good mileage and a nice style, it's hard to beat this Cobalt. Plenty of power for any city driver. A very full featured head unit(Aux input!). I was surprised at roll up windows and no power locks, but in the grand scheme of things, I'll take the better radio and forego those options. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I got the 2dr LT for 9,900 the last week in Dec. At 1,500 the driver seat begain to wear on the top half closed to the door. I waited to see what it would do. A 3,300 its really getting bad and I'm taking it in tomorrow. I really like everything about this car. It's short with roll up windows and manuel locks, but for 9,900 plus you cant beat it. I think the car handles fine, I'm fifty and drive the speed limit tho.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I am still in disbelief, I got 34 mpg on my 2nd tank. The dash read 34 and I also checked it against the amount of gas I used. In 2008 it really does not get better than that. Please note that I'm the guy on the freeway going 45 mph that everyone is honking at!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased 2008 LS Cobalt. Nothing fancy, just needed a new commuter for work. Driven mostly on hwy, getting 34mpg right now. With dealer and manufacturer incentives couldn't beat the price anywhere. If there is any "bad" to say about the vehicle it would be storage space Other than the glove box. There is virtually no place to put small things like glasses, pens, change, etc. Would be nice to have a center console arm rest too. But again I'm not complaining when I can purchase a brand new vehicle these days for a little over $11,500. Sweet!</TEXT>

<TEXT>With gas prices the way up we decide to shop for a fuel efficent vehicle. We looked at many cars and the Cobalt is a great little car. Please compare it with the foregin cars in the same class. You will find out how much more you get with the Cobalt and at a great price. The 2.2L 4cly has plenty of power to get on the freeways and has a smooth ride with good breaking, and great handling. Look at standard features you get with the Cobalt more HP, XM radio, side curtain air bags, 5 yr/1,000,000 power train. I have not owned a GM vehicle since 1984. GM has greatly improved I am very happy with this vehicle. Keep making these cars in the US. It's a great product.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Cobalt LS sedan has 4 speed automatic. Pickup is smooth. The whole car is so quiet inside it's scary. Some change from my '86 Aries. The bucket seats are very firm, but supportive - great for my back. The ride is much stiffer than that of the Aries, but the Cobalt takes curves much better. I don't like not being able to tell where the front end of the car is, so there's some tension getting into tight places. Because of the rear headrests, visibility when backing up is a bit of a chore. The power steering is nice, with enough feel to it, but because the steering wheel is small, it takes more cranking when parking. Heavy city driving gives 18mpg, same as the Aries. I hope this improves. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So far driving in this car I have seen that getting to 50 is quite an effort. I also feel a lag while trying to get to 70 on the interstate. The ride is smooth and the radio is nice. I like the hepa filter the AC/Heater has is a nice feature for an allergy sufferer I am. The seats are not as comfortable as my Escape. The car does at some points keep its energy enough to allow me to move up the interstate with the flow which is good. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the hepa filter its a nice addition and very helpful for allergy sufferers like myself. I also enjoy the integrated XM radio since I am a subscriber of the service already.

<TEXT>When I looked at the Cobalt, it was for the savings in both monthly payment, and gas money. However, the Cobalt surprised me with how fun it is to drive. The 5-speed manual transmission is smooth as can be, and the acceleration is as good as my '01 Celica GTS. The ride is very smooth and outside noise is minimal, even at 85- 90mph. The stereo system was a huge plus for me as well. I was not expecting a 7 speaker system with a sub in the trunk. I would have preferred Sirius over XM, (sorry Howard) but the sound of the system is excellent. Dashboard Info Centre is more interesting to flip through than network TV. First American car I've owned in more than 10 years, and so far so good!</TEXT>

This is an amazing small car. Excellent quality, very stylish interior with so many gadgets and gizmos standard I can't believe it, including 6 airbags! I don't think there is any other small car on the market that can compete with the Cobalt. The engine is powerful, ride is smooth, crisp, and quiet. And great quality. Toyota? Honda? No way.

It's a perfect car for me, someone who likes to drive a lot and don't mind taking other people with me. It is a small car and though it does not look like it, it does have a lot of room for passengers without feeling cramped. It also tells you everything about the car with the push of a button :tire pressure in each tire, mileage left before needing gas, temp outside, avrg speed. Also, it is great with the fact that it is inslated well from the outside. I hear no wind noise or normal engine noise, so it's a nice quite ride when I want it to be. I love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second review, having owned it for three months. My first review was from the new ownership perspective. This one is from the "getting used to it" side. I can honestly say that the Cobalt LS automatic coupe with a rear raised spoiler just keeps getting better from several perspectives. It looks a lot more expensive than it was (based on public reaction). It feels more expensive than it was (based on my owning a Mitsubishi as well and riding in Toyotas I don't own). And it performs as though it was a lot more expensive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got the 4dr Cobalt LT and am pleased with the car so far. The MPG is 24-25 in mixed driving. I have out about 600 miles on it. It took a while to find one that had AntiLock brakes and cruise but I finally did. I was able to get a GM card rebate of 2000 and a GM owner loyalty rebate of 1000 and the standard rebate of 1000 so I walked out of the dealership paying 11200 cash. MSRP Sticker was 16650 with transportation. I am pleased that side airbags were made standard for 2008 (antilock brakes should be too IMHO) The car is quiet compared with a Dodge Caliber I recently rented. Also the Cobalt shifts smoothly. The light grey interior will get dirty fast I think. Back seat is real tight. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration is there when needed. Front seat has good legroom if no-one is in back. XM radio free preview is nice. Quiet Ride Price was awesome -- I feel like with the rebates I got that I would've been hard pressed to find a better deal on a comparable car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I suppose every car has a "target market". I'm not sure if they had me, a 52 yr old family guy who grew up in the 60's in mind, but Chevy won me over with this puppy. I had a lease coming to an end on a 2006 Saturn Ion (which I found to be "acceptable" like some reviews including the editor's note) , so with the incentives offered by GM - it was off to the internet and the pavement. First off, this is a nice car for the money. Saturn dosen't make a poor man's starter model car anymore so the divorce is final there. Chevy still makes a bang for the buck car here. And it kind of looks like a "little Vette" Drives great. Comfortable. Stylish. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great looks inside and out. Super comfort for a large driver. Feels expensive. Free 3 months of XM radio which finally solves my anger with commercial radio formats to boot!

It is very economical & fairly comfortable. It is quieter than I expected and the stereo sounds nice with the XM radio. Although there is a lot of plastic in the interior, the fit and finish is very good. Overall it is an excellent car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stereo system is quite nice for such an inexpesive car. Fuel economy is good. The digital dash display with fuel mileage, tire pressures, etc. is surprising for the price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I chose the 2008 Cobalt LT based on its standard features, fuel economy, and low price. The Cobalt has nice sleek lines and a very simple aesthetic appeal. It's super peppy for a 2.2 liter and has an awesome turning radius. Highway noise is minimal and has a very smooth ride. I'm getting 34 MPG highway and about 26 MPG city.</TEXT>
