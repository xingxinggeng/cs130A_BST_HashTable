<TEXT>Traded in 2008 BMW M3 coupe for full boat 09 CTS-V auto. Have been watching this car prior to ever purchasing the M3 but needed more space - so I made the move. Looks are terrific and simply unparralled by the competition. What I did notice about this car is the obvious thrust / torque that goes with its monster engine. But I noticed that the car starts to handle and steer better as you increase speed. The suspension seems to set-up better, steering more response and crisp. My only grip is (don't forget, coming out of M3) is that there are a lot more creeks and noices coming from interior parts and the seats. Great car for GM, yes, DNA of the best cars on the road, not yet. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Recaro seats a must, exterior styling, wheels</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Finally pulled the trigger on the CTS-V as I could not refuse the almost $11,000 in discounts GM offers at this time on this model year. I cannot comment on reliability, yet, but I can tell you that you should NOT test-drive it unless there is a chance that you can afford to buy it. My test drive took 20 minutes with a smiling sales guy pressed into the seat and it was the most visceral and yet sublime experience I ever had in an automobile. External styling, interior, engine, suspension, brakes, steering feel, infotainment system...everything is a work of art. Cadillac absolutely hit a home-run and may have made the finest American car ever.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, engine, engine...556HP, 551 torque, engine, engine, 6.2l V8... :) :) The question on this car is rather what is NOT your favorite....</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Now my 21st car & all else in past fails compared to my new CTS-V. I had my doubts with a American made car & it's quality.I wasn't sure I needed this much HP? I for sure never spent over $70,000 for any car before, until now! All I can say is this car is a work of art & gives new meaning to sport & luxury! I'm thrilled I bought it & it's worth every penny!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Inside is just gorgeous, love the suede.Navigation is excellent compared to most cars.Ipod works terrific & sounds great! Cooled seats are nice. To many items to list would take all night!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am a 20-year loyal Honda/Acura buyer, so I bought this car with some trepidation as I have high expectations from my cars. I am NOT sorry I bought this car four months and 4500 miles ago, trading up from my beloved Acura RL. It lives up to EVERY bit of hype heaped upon it in the auto media. It is FAST, it is QUIET inside, the interior is high-quality, and the car is STEALTHY in that cops won't notice this car AT ALL. The torque is everywhere you want it to be. There are few buttons and they are large and intuitive. I didn't buy the car for gas mileage but it sure could use another gallon in the tank. Range is 240 miles in mixed 50-50 city/freeway driving, less when fooling around.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>STEALTH car! TORQUE everywhere; excellent exterior styling; relatively few buttons, simply laid out; regular seats are so comfortable; usable trunk; awesome brakes; large moonroof; Magnetic Ride Control; it drives like a Cadi when the wife is around, drives like a beast when she's not.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>6sp manual with recaros, now with Hennessey intake, AR Headers, tune (about 615 HP -- 521 to the rear wheels per dyno). Car is a blast, but traction is an issue, even in 104 degree weather. Just have to get over the fact that you can't floor it in 1st or 2nd in any weather without blowing the tires completely. 3rd gear hooks up in 90+ degree weather, and we'll see about cooler days this fall! Interior is very nice, but there is a bit more interior noise than in an audi I owned. 14-15 MPG average really isn't that bad for a 600HP sedan. Gadgets are very nice. The 8 inch nav touch screen is impressive. Excellent toy if scaring three passengers on the way to lunch is your cup of tea!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The manual transmission is pretty much perfect.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When you get behind the wheel of this monster already cranked-up (thank you remote start) you really know how a jet-jockey must feel getting into the cockpit of their already fired-up jet. Strap yourself down, select the manner in which you choose to drive and take off! I do wear my silk scarf when ever I can before taking off. Power, speed, and control at levels unheard of with a production line manufactured 4 door sedan - bar none! Then there are the looks. Talk about a phallic symbol on a testosterone high. Just point me in the general direction and get out of my way. This baby will get there and get there with maximum Velocity; which is exactly what the V in CTS-V stands for. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6.2L supercharged engine, transmission, suspension, Brembo brakes, exterior light package and interior illumination, cockpit style presentation of gauges and controls, Recaro seats, and panoramic electric sun roof w/ sun shade. Oh, plus, the 40 gigabit navigation/5.1 Bose sound/CD/bluetooth system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The V is by any standards the best vehicle in it's grouping, the very best. Sheer power, handling, and the excellent overall build is fantastic. If you have an M5 shame on you for not buying American steel, and to top if off the Cops do not have a clue about this vehicle. Can blow the doors off most anything on the road and the stealth factor kicks hindend.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation system rocks, and the interior is so well appointed, and designed taillights are also sun like. The standard features are way too many to mention, rainsensor wipers work great, the adaptive headlights, heated and cooled seats, and the Audio system with USB, insert USB drive with music</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Please, do not buy the V. I enjoy driving around knowing that there are very few vehicles that can deliver the fun, speed, luxury, ride, and FANTASTIC Power, M-5's and the rest look great in my rear view mirror. The power on corners, straightaways, and what ever is already there, and I have the Automatic. Do not tell the euro snobs of the V, keep it still, and please do not tell law enforcement. They drive by all the time looking at the CTS badge not having a clue. I keep looking straight ahead and be good on the street, as impossible as it is to be good. Do not let the unwashed masses know of this V, I like the fact no one knows of the V, a great secret. The interior lighting at n</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>flat our power at any speed, and the cornering of a train, stays on line and powers thru like a rocket ship. Interior is great, the BLUETOOTH works great, the Nav & Audio is second to non.the USB port, just plug it in and you have an instant music library. One can use the Hard drive if you like</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Loaded CTS-V with Auto. More fun than I have had in years. I have had two BMW-M's, two Mercedes SL's and about 9 Corvettes and none measure up. This car really lives up to the hype and then some. I hope GM can keep building these so more people can have the same fun. If the government takes over they will probaqbly kill it as not PC. Buy one now while you can.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power and the Recaro seats that help prevent the resulting whiplash.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned several Vettes, BMW's and many specialty cars. I have never driven something this much fun. Push the pedal and go...quickly. It will blister the tires on command. Drives through corners on a rail and keeps on asking for more. Don't count on good gas mileage. It is to much fun to push the accelerator. I will likely keep this car forever. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>the Internal Harddrive and complete IPOD control are really neat. Brakes are incredible. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have two Corvette's. One built by Chevrolet ('77, L-82, 350/350 coupe) and one by Cadillac ('09, CTS-V, Touring Sedan). Guess which one is faster and more powerfull, but not quite as slick looking - just by a little bit? There is not a Beamer or Mercedes worth the 30 to 40k more I'd be willing to pay for their prestige. Besides the Corvette Touring Sedan -V looks much cooler that either of them, especially out of my rear view mirror. Been there done that many times before and they flat out ain't worth it. Nor the 110K, at least, needed to purchase the coupe version of my CTS-V, i.e., ZR-1. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Horsepower, torque, transmission, Brembo breaks, electronics, Recaro seats, wheels/tires, and overall looks. But most of all: bang for the buck! Thank you Cadillac and GM. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>There is no better automobile for the money than this four door supercar. How would you like to buy a 4 door, 110,000 ZR-1 with better seats and interior for 65-70,000? Of course you would.... and you can. I did and the car is about 20,000 under-priced relative to any real competitor</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is great, luxury, features, performance, roomy and did I mention performance. The ride is very smooth and controlled no mater how you drive it. It is not as loud as you might expect from a performance sedan and just a joy to drive. The quality is as good as you can get and I have found no problems with it. The performance is off the scale, the Recarro seats are fantastic and the interior is well layed out and functional, not to mention beautiful. I have gotten an average of 11.4 MPG since I bought it but this is not a hybrid. This is my dream car, thanks Cadillac for making my dream come true and providing such a great example of "Good Ol American Know How".</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Suspension and drive train performance are flawless for hot rodding or cruising. Stereo, navigation system, and bluetooth work and sound great. Great looks both in and out. Keyless entry and ignition are fantastic and can be configured to suit based on individual needs. Did I mention the performance</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I first drove this car at Monticello in a marketing event. I was hooked. I bought the loaded Reacaro version with an automatic and I can tell you: this car is the real deal. It is a beast on the road and a beauty to behold. Loaded with luxury, handles lke a much lighter car, and will simply plant your head and body in the back of your seat whenever you ask. Here's a little secret: the ZR-1 engine is in this pup. You can easily get this engine to produce way more horsepower. In fact GM built it in such a way that it almost begs to be upgraded. A pulley here, new headers and cat back there, tune the tranny and engine, and there is nothing under 100k that can catch this car. Buy if you dare.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has set the standard for high performance luxury sedans, regardless of price. It handles better than most sports cars and is very quick and fast, extremely comfortable (w/optional Recaro seats), luxurious, solid, refined and loaded with useful technology. The exhaust note is aggressive and appropriate for the car's mission.</TEXT>
