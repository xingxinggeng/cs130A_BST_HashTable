<TEXT>I have owned a Lexus LS 430 for six years. When I test drove and purchased the Genesis 4.6, it was compared to Lexus and BMW. My Genesis has several little problems that my dealer claims is on all the Genesis cars and they can't fix them. Plus the programming of many of the car's functions leaves alot to be desired. I agree the the car has excellent performance but a car that frustrates you every time you drive it is not a pleasure. Perhaps I expect too much by thinking that a $40,000 auto should have all the bugs worked out before it is put on the market but I don't think so. Perhaps I am spoiled by Lexus but relatively speaking, this car does not meet my expectations of $40,000 car </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power and pickup is great and the braking in excellent. The back up camera is excellent on the large GPS screen.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far, so good with the car. I didn't really know what to expect with a Korean brand car. But the Genesis has proven itself capable to me. the Car is very beautiful, a little derivative. but most people think that it is a mercedes, which is a compliment. The dealership where I purchased it was definitely an interesting experience. Some of the team members were a bit oblivious to the features of the 3.8. but I finally got a guy to help me out with some important questions. Financing the car was good. got it for about 424/month with 1.9 APR. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system is a plus. Leather dash is very pleasant to live in while driving. the back seats are extremely roomy for the kids. The kids are now spoiled and act like business clients. Really, really safe. 8 airbags and that 5 star safety rating.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great looking car. I got lots of compliments. But the car simply has the worst ride of any vehicle I've owned. My Toyota Camry rides way better. I'm going for the second time to the dealer to see if anything can be done, but I'm not confident. I can't see myself driving this car for three years-I'd get rid of it tomorrow if I could. Very, very disappointing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Started having electrical problems within four months. Battery completely dicharges if vehicle is not used for 72 hours. Dealership has replaced battery numerous times and they can not figure out the problem. Changecd the radio/CD head unit for malfunction.Replaced the central console for malfunction. Seats are too small and stiff. Front passenger seat has very few adjustments. Air conditioning is not adequate for hot weather particularly when using in auto mode. CD functions are limited. CD does not change automatically from one disc to the next. The data stored in the memory, like phone numbers etc., are lost if you disconect the battery.</TEXT>

<TEXT>See my original review " Instant Classic" on 04/21/09. I've now own my Genesis 3.8 Tech for nearly 6 months. No problems so far, fit, finish, ride remains top notch. The exterior design is even better than first thought while the mileage slightly less (lots of city driving) than before. The integrated bluetooth is used extensively and all autos should have them for safety in today's cell phone culture. The navigation even easier to use once you know all the short cuts I've had no problems with the suspension and the ride remains a nice balance between soft and hard. Never a day goes by that someone takes a noticeable interest in my Genesis, This automobile is special!!!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lexicon 7.1 DVD sound system. HD/XM radio. Incredible night vision with adaptive headlights. Interior design remains impressive. The interface has been outstanding (bluetooth, voice command etc.) Cooled front driver seat and the A/C is impressive (live in S. Florida). Still quiet, quiet, quiet!!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>No complaints whatsoever. I'm kind of a person that likes to buy based on Value. Of course, Hyundai was the ticket. though, I was a bit skeptical about the Hyundai brand, the Genesis shattered my perceptions about the brand. I can not say how classy the car remains even after a few months of ownership. put a Genesis badge and the car is not that much different from a Bentley IMO.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just leased a base model Genesis a week ago. Sadly I like everything about it except the suspension. When I first test drove it, I noticed it was a bit bumpy, but I thought maybe it was because of the road I was on. I also noticed a few reviews mentioned bumpiness. But when I test drove it the second time it felt OK so I went ahead and leased it. After I took it home, I started feeling that the bumpiness was quite pronounced and at times jarring. I often find myself getting bumped up out of my seat, akin to the feeling of airplane turbulence. The vehicle has an odd combination of soft and hard ride. It feels cushy on a perfectly smooth road, but imperfections make the ride feel very bumpy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Attractive inside and out; good fit and finish; good smell; nice instrument panel; big trunk; smooth transmission; quiet; good safety features (not too many cars have both head curtain AND airbag for the rear seats); spacious front and back seats; temperature control panel for rear passengers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ok here it is...I purchased a Hyundai. I feel so much better getting that out in the open. I was driving a Lexus IS before the...Hyundai. Still difficult to say. The car has great power with the V6, wouldn't pay extra for the V8. The ride is what you would expect from a Lexus, Benz or BMW. Small storage space is limited. Average 27-28 MPG on the Hwy. Being 6'1" the cabin has more than enough room. The back seat is also very spacious. Simply said I love the car and at $31,999 the price was right. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Genesis with the V8 is a kick to drive. It is a very stylish car and the interior is beautiful. Those are the two reasons why I bought it. There are a few kinks that still have to be worked out with mine. After having the tires balanced it is still rough on the interstate. The brakes still screech when I back out of the garage. </TEXT>

I compared it against the Cadillac, Maxima, Lexus ES350 and Acura TL and like this car the best.

<TEXT>I bought V-6 in October 2008. I drove MB & Lexus in the past. This is absolutely much better car than MB and Lexus if you take the price into consideration. If you are willing to pay $ 20 or 30 K more just for the brand, go ahead but I really recommend this car why you waste hard earned money, especially under a current economic situation. Again, this car is equal to or better than MB or Lexus in all respects except for a hugh price difference. I am telling you that If your are looking for a new car, buy this car, you will nor regret.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased a 4.6 Genesis for my wife, and I'm not too impressed. An impulse buy really, but I'm beginning to see why the car is so much cheaper than my BMW. The engine is pretty nice, but in no way compares with my 550i's V8 (torque curve, etc). I'm pretty particular about my cars, and it's the little details with the Genesis that turn me off. The materials just feel inferior, and it just seems like Hyundai stole design features from all of their so- called "competitors", down to the fake iDrive and 5-series exterior styling cues. I think the buyers of this car will realize over time that this car is just a flashy attempt at producing a true luxury car w/o any substance.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride similar to my wife's old Lexus; sound sys. is better than any equivalent Toyota. I can definitely see choosing this car over say an Acura or lower end Lexus, but just don't see how they say it competes with the German luxury makes or top- end Lexus sedans.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just passed 1200 miles and this car is a winner for Hyundai. Drives well in Erie PA snow. There is a luxury about the Genesis that "drove" me to it. Everything so far is excellent... As with all new model cars there maybe an issue or two that comes up. Genesis provides the higher cost models (Lexus/BMW/Acura/Mercedes, etc) a true run for the money. The 5 year BTB is one of the key components for the purchase. Hyundai's decision to extend the extra year was a thoughtful and calculated one. I agree with all previous comments from other owners. I did research for at least 6-9 months prior to purchase and I am glad I did. The service is key to post purchase and success to Hyundai.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Agree with all previous comments. As Hyundai builds the 2010 Genesis I am sure they will incorporate the features that most 2009 owners have strongly suggested. I am waiting for a direct call from either the Regional or National Hyundai Office to discuss the issues for improvements.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Never thought I would ever buy a Hyundai but I am truly satisfied. Traded in my 540i which was breaking down for a much faster and smoother car. It doesn't handle like a BMW but still pretty nice. People tried to discourage me from getting a Genesis and now they are the ones who are thinking about it after riding my car :) </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been a Hyundai owner for about 5 years and have always been impressed with the quality of the cars for the money you spend. The Genesis is absolutely no exception. I went in for an oil change on my old Elantra, test drove the Genesis, and got it that day. At least once a day I have someone comment on how much they love the look of the car. The solid performance rounds out a really great package. Be careful though if you live in colder climates, the car is a real wheel drive which is great when it is nice out, and even in the rain but when it snows, the car struggles for traction (I spent 35 minutes today stuck on the side of a slightly inclined road while other cars passed)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am only 19 years of age but I know cars. My parents have leased several BMW's which i have driven. I decided to purchase the Genesis because of all that you get for the money. The 4.8 Genesis has 7 series luxury, 5 series performance, for a 3 series price. The pickup is better than the Cadillac CTS, BMW 3 and 5 series, MB C, E, and CLK class, and Lexus IS, ES, GS, and is even compared to the LS, 7 series, and S-class. This car will be remembered for years to come. A true collector's item an the age where collector cars have died out since the 1970's. I will definitely keep this car looking good and running well to keep value high.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Genesis for two weeks now and cannot say enough about this car. I also own a 2005 Infiniti and the build quality on the Genesis beats the Infiniti hands down. The acceleration on the V8 is amazing. Given the fairly similar fuel economy to the V6 and all the small extras you get with the 8, it's definitely worth the few extra bucks. I've driven an LS 430 several times and can say that this car knocks the Lexus out of the ballpark. Anyone who owns any of the major luxury brands and is in the market for a new ride should not discount this car simply because it's a Hyundai -- and if they do, it's their loss.</TEXT>

Hyundai hit the nail on the head when developing this great luxury automobile.</TEXT>

It has all the high tech gadgets which are remarkably easy to operate especially by someone like me that eschews reading instructions and following complicated manuals. DO NOT TEST DRIVE the 4.6 unless you are prepared to buy this car when you return to the dealership. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Absolutely love it! I drive approx 23,000+ miles annually so its extremely important I have a vehicle that is comfortable, has get-up-and-go for the freeways, is great to handle up and down the mountains in California, that is classy yet sporty...I'm telling you this car has it all! Everyone stares at the car - even those with Beemers and Mercedes B drivers in total disbelief. The car is a total dream to drive. I set cruise, set the seat back, plug in the IPod and off I go. I stayed with the V6 because that had PLENTY of power. I don't know I'd do with the V8. As it is I do 85/90 and don't realize it. Awesome, awesome, car! Go for it...seriously give the Genesis thought. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Never thought I'd buy a Hyundai. But I gave up my BMW 3-series for the Genesis, and I am extremely satisfied. Far more luxury and better craftsmanship. The extra cost of the BMW is only for the slight handling edge on the track and for the bragging rights; I need neither. I put 3,000 miles on my Genesis in just two weeks. Every mile adds to the satisfaction. Absolutely no complaints. If the Genesis's reliability is closer to that of the modern-day Sonata and Azera rather than the '86 Excel, that's all I'll need! Had just spent 3 months in Seoul, and was impressed with the Koreans' fast- developing economy, technologies, and mentalities. The Genesis personifies them all.</TEXT>

The quality is awesome, the car is solid & extremely quiet, the performance is great and the price is low for what the car offers! It has all the features of a twice as expensive car + 5 years full warranty. The interior is as big as Lexus LS and BMW 7 series and the quality is just as good! I?ve been driving it for 1 month now and I can?t find any flaws. The snobs might say: ?it?s a Hyundai?, but this is how Lexus started as well. Unless you?re willing to pay $20-30k more for the brand name to buy a similar car, you?ll be impressed with the Genesis! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned 2 Lexus's since 1998 a GS 300 and clocked 187000 miles on it an excellent car which performed in all aspects wonderfully. I then bought a Lexus IS250 I enjoyed the all wheel drive but when reading about the Genesis I was very intrigued and once I drove the 4.6 I was ready to buy. The car has all the features of both my Lexus's except the doors don't unlock when in proximity to the car. The brakes are tremendous the steering perfect, fuel economy very good considering the V8 power,super ride, great acceleration, very fine interior materials comfortable seats and with Technology Package all the toys. I love the size of the car lots of comfort in the back seat best car I've owned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a long-time dedicated American car owner. This time after dissatisfaction with the American choices available I reluctantly begun to shop foreign cars. a friend suggested taking a look at the Hyundai Genesis. My first look was at a 3.8 and although impressed was not sold. When a 4.6 hit the lot I was done! This is a surprising car with the amount of interior and trunk space, ride, and quality of engineering. If Korean automakers can do it so much better than our domestic models, it is no wonder we are having to bail out our own companies.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got a Sterling Blue V6 w/ Tech/Prem pkgs a month ago. I've been enjoying the car very much. It's fun to come out of stores and have guys standing around the car and saying "that's a Hyundai?". I got the "wings badge" for the trunk lid, just to keep them guessing. The car is a dream to drive, and very well designed inside. I wish I had more miles on the lease, as I would love to just drive, drive, drive. I expect that when this market recovers, this will be THE car to own.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Access to this red pearl beauty (might remind one of a Mercedes) is without reaching into a pocket or purse. The interior is soft and stylish (Lexus comes to mind) and adjusts to fit the driver and passenger perfectly, seats, mirrors, steering, and controls. The air conditioned seats will not be needed this winter, however, the heated seats will make cozy ride cozier. Recently on the interstate being caught up in a snarly of big rigs and car traffic, I thought I would test the 4.6 liter engine. I a few seconds the snarl was in the far rear view. I said to my wife, "I just glanced at speedometer and we are just come down from 110 mph." Fun and pride come from owning the Genesis.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Excellent vehicle! I've never been a "Label-looker" so I shop for the goodies at a reasonable price. This car delivers and then some. The ride is comfortable yet responsive. The interior is ample. I'm built like an NFL defensive end and I'm very comfortable. The amenities are numerous, you get a lot with the standard package. I have the Premium Plus and I'm very happy. The trunk is spacious. The V-6 290 bhp engine is as smooth as butter on a hot muffin and you can cruise at 80 mph without nary a concern. An All-Wheel drive version would be too sweet! The stereo system is very nice, audiophile worthy. A great buy if you're into affordable luxury and you tend not to follow the "label".</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine is too nice; Strong, quiet and responsive. The ride is smooth and stable with very little road noise. The safety features are too numerous to even list, but I can say you won't want for airbags. The car just feels "SOLID" and well built. You can't but a better car for the money...$36K</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was ready to buy a new civic...but this thing blew me away and forced me to change my game plan. Have owned many cars and currently have a 528i in the garage. The Genesis is an extraordinary vehicle in that it is 'smooth' - driving it is actually almost a pleasure (I drive over 100 miles a day for work). It is not as tight as the 5 series, but has more power than the 528. Refined, many options, very quiet, awesome interior detail. Not sure it will hold it's value over time but jumped on a great lease deal for the premium plus package. Do get the premium package at least on this vehicle or you will lose money when you sell it. This will not replace a BMW, but sure complements it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With 2,500 miles, the Genesis V-* with Tech package, has eliminated initial doubt about buying a Hyndai. The car is very quiet, nice interior materials with excellent fit, abundant power and great ride. Have owned new BMW 540, Acura TL's and currently have an '07 Acura MDX w/Tech. Gas mileage on a 1,250 mile trip was 27 mpg at legal speeds, city driving appox. 19-20 mpg. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I have owned a lot of vehicles before we purchased the Genesis; some very good and some bad. As we age and not into status or snob appeal any longer value,reliability, warranty coverage, and styling are important. Brand cachet was certainly not a consideration when we bought a 2006 Sonata LX (loaded V6). It is a great car for the money. Superb gas mileage for a 235 hp V6 and plenty of good features.So when the Genesis made it's debut in the lux arena we bought a White Satin Pearl 3.8 w/tech package as it came off of the truck. A year of due diligence in the form of technical research, auto magazine and critical reviews sold me on another Hyundai. What an awesome vehicle!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Actually too many great features with the tech package, but the voice commands to replace your hands is great. Also the quiet cabin is amazing - how did they do that? The interior is stunning and that came from MB owner! The suspension system with road sensing ability and stability control...wow!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After three months, I have found the Genesis to be unstable when driving in medium to strong wind, The steering wheel feedback from the highway is to severe and not acceptable, the manual trunk lid operation to be cheap and unacceptable, the lack of electrical front passenger seat settings to be unacceptable. I continue to study the driver services and reserve any comments on that part at this time. It is the items mentioned above that upset me as an owner and I find it unacceptable engineering for such a car Hyundai hopes to use in competition with BMW, Mercedes and Lexus. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought my Hyundai 4.6 last week. My first impressions are this is a great car for the price. If you are reading this and are thinking of buying a BMW, Lexus or MB you need to drive this car. Traded our Volvo s60 R for this car and I couldn't be happier. The steering is not as tight as a BMW or MB and the ride is softer but thats okay for my driving habits. I had a deal for a nicely optioned 2008 BMW 535I that fell through.When all was said and done we financed $17k less for a fully loaded Genesis 4.6. More reviews to come as I get more acquainted with car, but at first impression this car is great value for the money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been impressed since the first ad I saw. Visited the dealership just to see the interior and I was amazed with the fit and finish. Bought a V6 with all the bells and whistles the next day. 2 weeks, 500 miles later I was at the repair center because the stereo was wigging out. They replaced the $4K head unit which made no difference. Now they are replacing the amp hoping that will fix it. The alignment has been pulling to the left since I bought it and they supposedly fixed that too. Nope, still pulls left. Beautiful, comfortable, fun car but they still need to work out the kinks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My company name- Genesis, so my wife kept suggesting that I buy... a Genesis. For the fun of it, we did a test drive and fell in love. The dealership was sensitive to the upscale nature of the car and us being informed buyers. It has been BIG fun so far with the head turns (there are only 3-4 in Tyler TX (our home) so far. And we are adding all of the 'wings' extras to personalize it from KAI. The trim is the premium plus with the technology package. We wanted the V8, but.. they can't keep them on the lot! I was ok with the power of the V6, but missed some of the trim that is only available on the V8. BUT, we're adding most back in. LOVE it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our Genesis V6 -- Premium Pkg. -- in mid-July this year and have been extremely happy with it to date. Fuel economy is amazing, 20 - 22 in strictly in-town driving, high 20s to low 30s on the highway. On our first 1100 mile trip with mileage divided 80/20 between Interstate and local/city, we averaged 29.4 mpg. The comfort level is beyond any other car we've owned. The engine is nearly silent and very strong -- it loafs at 75 mph on the Interstate. Would strongly recommend a test drive to anyone who is looking for a very high level of comfort, features, and performance.</TEXT>

Throttle is a bit sluggy off the line, but punch it a little and she zooms up to speed with very smooth shifting and great tracking- sound system is superior, hand free phone at HWY speed sounds great to callers, this is a great car and a great value- time will tell if the abundance of plastic parts will hold up and I noticed that the rear wheel wells are lined with some type of fibrous cladding- hope it holds up well to Chicago winter- all in all, this has been a joy to drive, and I am constantly getting the thumbs up from other drivers- this car is becoming the hot ride of the season.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first luxury vehicle, just coming out of a 96 Maxima SE. Test drove the 2009 Maxima, 2008 Acura TL, and the Genesis. The Genesis outclassed them all, so I ended up buying a V6 w/Tech Package. The features on this car are an incredible value even though I still shudder when I think about how much higher my loan is on this car. Great ride - kind of similar to my father's 2001 BMW 528i, but more smooth overall. Definitely not as mushy as a Lexus, but not as punishing as a Beemer. Great looking car, too - I've gotten a lot of rave reviews of the car's looks and disbelief when I tell them "It's a Hyundai." All-around excellent car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Genesis is actually the best stereo you can buy that that delivers you to your destination in fine luxury and comfort. The balance between comfort and being close to sporty is outstanding. Car & Driver and Road & Track can gig the car for Sportiness - not all of us like the taut, firm ride of the BMW'S and Audi's. The gas mileage is better than expected, especially cruising at 75. As mentioned by many, dealer support for a luxury car needs to be better. Hyundai does stand by there warranty. Our dealer gave us 2 years worth of oil changes and car washes, and has a very good reputation. I would advise finding a good dealer when buying. The value of this Luxury car is outstanding.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stereo! Stereo! and Stereo! The ride is out of the world, and the backlit dash at night is out of this world. The warranty is outstanding, and the other Luxury Sedans can't compete in features and amenities for the price. And it fits my 6'4" frame, something that lacks in the BMW and Mercedes.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is often compared to BMW 5 series and E series MB's, but it's probably closest in size, engine type, features, and overall class to Infiniti's M35. Closest until price is compared. At about $10K less, it's the automotive bargain of the year, perhaps decade. Like others I looked at and drove BMW, MB, Audi, Lexus, Infiniti and others, all of which are a lot more money. Believe me, none are quieter, more comfortable, more solid feeling, or handle better in every day traffic. This Hyundai is that good. I can only provide a warning.

Prior vehicles (since 1994) -- 1998 Mercedes SL600, Infinity Q45(2), Lexus ES(300 & 330), a 2002 Porsche Turbo, and a VW Phaeton. It is our experience that the 2009 Genesis is absolutely the best value of any of the above cars - there is NO comparison versus what Hyundai packs into this vehicle for $40K when fully loaded. We could have chosen ANY car we wanted and yet opted for this because of our prior excellent experience with the Azera and the fact that the Genesis offers far more features and performance for MUCH less money than ANY of the autos we have owned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Like many others here, I too can't believe I even looked at Hyundai, let alone getting one! I began researching this car early in the year. I was coming to lease end on a 2006 M45 Sport and wanted something much less expensive, uses regular fuel and gets better gas mileage. I liked the handling dynamics of the M45 and was worried that I took a big step backwards in handling. Not so! I have found myself taking the same turns and curves in the Hyundai that I did with the M45 - at the same speeds - and the Hyundai is just as "planted" as was the M45. Obviously the M was quicker, but I enjoy everything about the Hyundai better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice roomy interior, large trunk. A sound system (Lexicon) that you blow you out of the car. A quiet, smooth ride. I have only put about 800 miles on it and I am averaging 24 mpg! I love the navigation system and being able to play MP3's using the USB connection.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned this car one month with every passing week appreciating the Genesis more and more. The technology features are plentiful and well thought out. Dollar for dollar the Genesis equipped with the Tech Package is a stunning value. The 290hp V6 engine is more than adequate for enthusiastic driving. The Genesis handling is nicely balanced between sportiness and numbness with just enough road feel to inspire confidence and comfort. Exterior noise does not penetrate the cabin yielding a wonderfully quiet ride. The 528w 17 speaker Lexicon surround sound fills your driving experience with clear, crisp, enriching musical enjoyment. I considered 335xi, CTS4, & ES350, but bought a Genesis. Wow!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was following & really looking forward to this motor car, so I bought it! Owned 7 series & was nice compromise, esp. price. Hyundai's first foray with an all-new RWD platform & V8 engine in this class is impressive. My car turns heads and I love its understated execution. Has the luxury amenities I need and $$$ to spare. Wish it was sold in a dedicated channel -- i.e., Genesis brand -- wouldn't mind stripping the H logo and replacing it with domestic market Genesis wings logo (front, back, wheel hub & horn pad)</TEXT>

<TEXT>We wanted to drive a VW Passat, Chevy Malibu, and a Genesis on the same day. Went from the VW dealer to the Hyundai and bought the Genesis. There was no comparison, the other cars were nice mid size family cars (both with noted nice interiors), but couldn't hold a candle to the Genesis. The big Hyundai was quieter, smoother, and so much nicer on the inside and outside than the other two. It really reminded me of the Lexus debut of the LS400 back in '89. I went to that knowing that this car was supposed to be different than any other Toyota ever seen, but was blown away by how nice it really was. Same feelings here. My Wife is very happy with the car too.</TEXT>

All I can say is I am so glad the folks at Infiniti BS'd me on the new payment! I would have missed out on the best vehicle I have ever driven. Everything from top to bottom is so well done. If this is Hyundai's first attempt at a luxury vehicle, I can wait to see what they come up with next. This is a $60-70K car with a $35K price tag! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Drove the car for the first time yesterday and all I can say is WOW! Never thought driving a Hyundai could be so fun or engaging yet so relaxing and assuring. Feels more secure than any BMW I've ever driven definitely more on par with an A8 as far as structural feel. In performance driving the car has such a neutral feeling and is very balanced weather on or off the accelerator. I don't think the ESP even tried to keep the car in line it just did it on it's own. This car looks great with tight wheel well gaps (looks like it's already lowered) and sharp tight body lines. The only thing I might change is the rear tail lamps so it looks less like an Infiniti.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Technology packages is really cool don't think the car would be quite as impressive without that. Love the USB port and Ipod connectivity in the center console. This car drives perfect in my eyes if you need more power I am sure the V8 will be plenty for most anyone as I am satisfied with the V6. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just took delivery on July 15th. It's a nice car. Good looks and ride. Nice features. I average 23mpg mixed driving. The car has a nice exterior design. Inside is kinda boring. Get the Lexicon sound system. You'll love it (I know I do). However, the cd changer had to be replaced (stopped working). The service department is not up to par with other luxury dealers (especially BMW). Loaners are nice when your car is in the shop for a day (the shuttle vans don't cut it). And for the amount of time I own a car (usually 3 yrs) BMW still has the best warranty. Love the standard maintenance warranty (4yr 50k). At the end of the day this is still just a Hyundai. But, overall I'm happy with the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a great car!! Makes you totally rethink the brand. The interior is a lot lot better than what the pics show in the web or in magazines. The fit and finish is very good and the Lexicon really is AMAZING!! I thought the steering would feel too light as a lot of bigger luxury cars tend to be, but i was pleasantly surprised...it's no sports sedan in feel but it has a good amount of resistance and good on center feel. Only gripe is the bluetooth, no wheel mounted controls and does not come through the cars existing speakers. Go test drive one with an open mind and you will soon forget all that you thought was a Hyundai. I give it an A.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Hyundai Genesis is an outstanding car and performs very well. This is a luxury sedan that is powerful, quiet, luxurious, attractive and priced very competitively. Handles very well w/ a sporty ride. Great fuel efficiency for a 3.8L V-6 engine. The instrumentation is great and the sound system is top of the line. I compared the Mercedes E- Class, Lexus 350, Jaguar XF, Infiniti M-35/45 and BMW 5 Series before I chose this vehicle. I think its equal or superior in most aspects, yet was less costly than all of the other vehicles I compared. Great value. Hyundai has a real winner in my opinion!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my pre-owned 3.8 from a man who is known to be less than frugal who really "unloaded" this beauty upon me. It is a gorgeous car, but after I drove it 850 miles it reminds me of the gorgeous, brainy woman who can't boil water. Only the BMW 318i that I just sold rode worse. The suspension system is horrible. When the tires are cold you can feel every tar strip in the highway. The guys who designed the suspension should not be allowed to graduate fro high school this year. The steering is also numb and it becomes very tiring to be driving with the intent to find a good centerline feel and have that suspension fighting me. There is too much road noise being transmitted into the car. </TEXT>

It is interesting to hear people complain about the suspension, when in fact Hondas, Mazdas, and now fords ride give me a backache every time I drive one. The dealership experience was solid. It felt like I was getting a luxury car at a costco. There was nothing wrong with the dealers at Hyundai. They treated me well, they knew the details about the Genesis. As well, they did not rush me or push me to make a purchase on the Hyundai.</TEXT>

<TEXT>You just can't get more car for the buck than the Genesis. I wanted an entry full-size luxury car for a little over $30k, and so my options were limited.

Of course one can get a used Lexus or something, but I wanted a new car, plus Hyundai has the great warranty. And even if I could afford a new Lexus es or gs, I'd much Rather save the money for gas and go with the no-name Genesis. </TEXT>

It is fun to drive but it is NOT COMFORTABLE with its crappy suspension design. The 7-speaker system is good. And trunk, glove box and handrest box are big but no partition at all. There is no way to organize the items, quite a mess. Many people starred the car while driving. And it brings some talks with friends and strangers while parking. Water came into trunk when open. Please and Please fix the suspension in all effort for the pioneer (who bought the first year Genesis) as the compensation.</TEXT>

This piece of advice may help with those complaining about the hard ride, I just spoke with my Hyundai Service Manager about softening up the ride. He told me that the car comes from the factory with a hard rubber tire, and that if it had a softer rubber tire on it, it would ride better with less bumps. I'm not complaining, I still have all the luxury, I still have over $25,000 in my pocket vs owning one of those other high end luxury brands,its cheaper maintance, and EVERYONE STILL WALKS AROUND THE CAR ADMIRING IT.

<TEXT>Nothing but praise for the first few thousand miles then occasionally starting goes to about 400 RPM and runs rough. Had to shut down. Access steering would run halfway down and would have to manually reposition it. Rear air would intermittently go to full hot (so much the the center console and side of the drvr seat was hot to touch). These's a tech order out on the heat but the dealer is not allowed to change the part unless they can duplicate the problem.Now the "new" Tau engine is knocking for the first few minutes after start indicating a possible internal lubrication problem (dealer not sure if problem).

<TEXT>Hyundai went above and beyond with this car. TOO MUCH FUN!!! For the money, there is not a better value on the market, period. I love the fact that this car is indeed a Hyundai, which appeals to a person like myself who wants luxury without the cliche of owning Infiniti, Mercedes, BMW, etc. The surprise that comes with the discovery that it's a Hyundai is priceless. I've had a few issues with the AFLS (Adaptive Front Lighting System) and she was in the shop 3 times in about 2 weeks. Eek! But that's been the only issue, and considering it's a production model I was expecting a lot worse. True, it's been less than a month but I don't care, she's here to stay!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The plain truth about the 2009 Genesis is that it has a horrible suspension and rides like an old truck. You can feel every bump in the road. I think you could run over a fishing worm and feel it. This severe defect is not immediately noticeable during a short test drive. The dealer states that this is designed into the car because it is a high performance automobile. It is fairly smooth on the interstate but it jitters and bounces over suburban streets. The ride is the most important element of a car and it fails my expectations. I'm not alone in my review of the suspension. Read the Hyundai Genesis Web site for more. The car is a beautiful car in all other aspects it is fantastic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car blows me away - it's worth every penny, the technology is top-notch, the interior is unbelievable. It's quiet, comfortable, and tons of power. My only complaint (reason for 9 in comfort) is road noise from the Dunlops and a little stiffer ride than I would have expected. Aside from this, it's still one of the quietest cars I've been in. Wing badges are essential, but leave the flying H on if you really want to raise eyebrows. HD radio = awesome. XM = not really all that awesome after listening to HD. Navigation works very well. Seats are VERY comfortable for me even at 6'6" and over 300lb. Best of all = wife loves it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lexicon + laminated front glass = audiophile's dream. Gauges and trim illumination at night feels like a spaceship cockpit. The V8 purrs...and screams - very smooth power curve. Camera and parking assist are VERY nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 4.6 Hyundai replaced my lease expired Chrysler 300 Hemi. The Hyundai is a better driving car and has more luxury features. The ride is smoother and quieter, the quietness being my first impression when I test drove the car. I don't think it has quite the acceleration of the Chrysler, but way more than enough for the traffic situations I drive in. The Hyundai exterior design is not as impressive as the Chrysler, but the interior is beautiful. The car is loaded with a surprising amount of luxury features, for the price. The car is as roomy as the Chrysler and has as much trunk space. The seats are well designed for comfort. Driver controls and pushbottons are readily accessible.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet soft ride is most impressive. I also like the electronic push-button start system that makes it very difficult to lock your key in the car. Very important to forgetful people like me. </FAVORITE>

I have owned BMW's and a Mecedes before this car and never thought I would buy a Hyundai. Well, I don't think I'll ever waist $30K again just for the sake of a Euro label.

<TEXT>After researching luxury vehicles for over 8 months, I decided on the Genesis. I bought the 4.6 with the tech package in February when they became available in my area. Boy am I glad I bought this instead of the Lexus LS 460. Same car for 30-40K less. While the Lexus ride is smoother, Genesis matches most everything else. Why pay more? I put the Korean badging on it and enjoy watching the rubber-neckers wonder what type of car it is.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 9,000 miles, I'm embarrassed to take people in the car. There's a new rattle every day - the doors, the dash, you name it. It's worse than the 1980's GM cars. The car restarts itself - people really laugh at me when that happens. The nav sends me into lakes. The transmission clunks. The engine stalls pulling out into traffic, which is terrifying. You can't stand to sit in it for more than 30 minutes. It vibrates. In cold weather, it clears one side of the wind shield and freezes the other. The rear defroster does nothing. The list is endless. I'm a real customer and not a shill that's why you're getting the real truth from me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Genesis 3.8 V6 is the Best Kept Secret in the luxury car lane ... but undoubtedly not for long! Leased my new black, premium-plus pkg Genesis about 3 weeks ago after my usual exhaustive, but comprehensive research. Every aspect of the car's looks and performance has met or exceeded my expectations; in short, this is honestly not another car on the road I would covet over my Genesis! The power train is silky smooth, tons of acceleration power on demand, smooth transmission with super-powerful, turbo- level boost in manual shift mode when entering onto highway ramp or pulling out into fast oncoming traffic. Lines of the car are the envy of every co-worker and valet who's seen it</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have been looking at the Genesis since they were first announced here in the US. Always thought they were a great car for a wonderful price. Well the deal we got last week was just super, and we could not be happier with our new vehicle. Acceleration is super, really puts you back in your seat. The handling is spot on, very tight in the turn and you have a great feel of the road. Best of all we love all the gadgets. We got the tech package and it is worth every penny. The sound system is unmatched and the driver's information system is as good as I've ever seen. Lexis, BMW, and Benz need to really be worried. Same quality and service for 2/3 the price.</TEXT>

Ride is quite smooth - but not perfect - especially on rough roads. Beautiful and comfortable interior. Whisper-quiet engine with lots of power. (Can't understand why anyone would want the 8 cly.) I did not order the tech package, but bought a Garmin instead. Unless you need frequent directions - this is the way to go. My bluetooth cannot read my voice commands!

<TEXT>This is a perfect value proposition for a person who in the 80s and 90s drove Lincoln Town Cars and since 1998 a flawless Infiniti Q-45. I like quiet comfort and no mechanical problems, and so far so good. The Genesis has the exterior styling of much more expensive BMW and Lexus sedans and the interior is roomier than the Town Cars and the Q. The back seat leg room is amazing and without skimping on trunk space. The trunk is half again larger than the Q. The V6 has plenty of power and the transmission is as smooth as can be. My mileage depends on the brand of gas, and I get 29 mpg on brand name regular, and 25.5 on off-brand, a 10% trade off. The Q was 20 mpg on premium.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The comfort & ride, the power, the mileage on regular gas, and the luxury looks inside and out. The XM is wonderful.

On a recent round trip from Florida to Cleveland the car averaged around 30.4 mpg at highway (some mountain driving) speeds. I deem that outstanding considering the cars size and weight. I have two complaints; 1.The suspension seems to hit the bump stops quite often on choppy roads. 2.Sometimes the rear doors wont automatically unlock. This situation happened after a software update to the car. The dealer will check it out at the next service. Other than that I am a "happy camper."</TEXT>

<TEXT>There is plenty to say about this car...all positive. The 3.8 has great acceleration and should satisfy most drivers. The gas mileage, well I have to keep checking it to make sure it is right! My wife drives mostly in town with a few highway trips and is getting 24 mpg on average. A quick 300 mile trek jumped it up to 28 mpg. I see other complaints about the suspension but we are pleased with our car; the wind and bumpy roads do not affect the ride that much and is an exceptionally quiet ride. My inlaws dumped their 2 year old Lexus after riding with my wife on that 300 mile trip. If you just have to have the snob appeal and want to pay 20-30 grand more for the same lux then have at it. </TEXT>

Went to test drive it at the Dealership & that was it. I was hooked like a drug. Could not take it off my mind. Waited a couple of days went to test drive it again and was still stunned how well it drove and how great it made me feel. I just had to have it, a total no brainer for me - got the 4.6 Tech.

<TEXT>Have owned many luxury automobiles, Lexus, MB, Infinity, Audi, and Acura. This car is a winner. Comfortable, responsive, quiet and fun to play with. Have the Premium Plus pkg and Tech Pkg. Also included the "European prestige" pkg. Given the choice, I would pick the Genesis. Just to note, some of the comments indicated that they had not read the manuals. The outside mirrors do not tilt down if the control is centered. Left or right will tilt if the control remains on either left or right. This car should not be overlooked by anyone looking for a handsome, well made luxurious and reasonably priced auto.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Audio, GPS, back up camera and sensors. Quietness, responsiveness of the 6 cylinder. Overall luxurious look of the car. A pleasure to drive. Mine is Titanium Gray Metallic, with black interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased a Genesis 4.6 and although it is a high performance beautiful vehicle I am very concerned about the bumpy jittery ride. I actually had a headache from the bumpy ride. I test drove 3 different vehicles in Houston and Phoenix and did not experience the rough ride. But the vehicle I purchased was located for me to meet my color preference and the ride is rough. Are there adjustments that can be made to smooth out the ride? Is it tires, shocks? I am very concerned as I was thrilled with my purchase my now am worried I made a huge mistake.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Love My Genesis</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I had followed this car ever since it was revealed in Detriot Show. The only thing I can say is this is the best car I've ever owned. I was an advent Nissan car owner, but when I test drove the Genesis, I was sold. For what you get at the price, you can't beat it. A gentleman in a BMW 7- series stopped me in the parking lot to ask me what kind of car is that, I proudly said "The Genesis"</TEXT>

<TEXT>I see many criticizing the handling of this car. Personally, I think it is close to perfect. I find most luxury cars too soft with the handling and this car corners flat with predictable handling while not losing a luxury feel. It does have a tendency to porpoise a bit and there is room for improvement there. The thought given to this car and what is important to the driver is exceptional. I love most of the interior except the seats and headroom. I am 6' 5" and I feel the seat needs to be lowered or have some padding removed. The seats should also be bigger offering some lateral support. Overall this is a winner for Hyundai and if they listen to consumers it can only get better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling with predictable and responsive driving. Aluminum and leather interior (need more of this). IPOD, AUX, and USB Inputs.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Compared to M45 and 535i. The Genesis won before considering the 18-26k savings. quiet reserved car until 5k rpm at which point this becomes a drivers car. I still don't know the corner limits of this car. After 5k sometimes hard miles no rattles or other issues have come up. If your looking for high end content without the high end badge this is the car for you!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine - so much power on tap. Suspension - never met a corner it didn't like. Stereo - best I have heard in any car. Friends with Infiniti and BMW comment on sound quality. Interior design - leather dash insert looks great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With less than 1000 miles I can still say that this is a really great car, especially when you consider the price. The fit and finish are superb, but the ride could be improved. The engineers should work on the rough and unsettled ride if they want to beat the big boys. We came from an MBZ 400E that was too old, but still gave us a great ride and handling. This is the first ownership of a car with all the bells and whistles, but we're getting used to it and it's fun. The acceleration is without peer and the interior quietness is excellent.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned my 4.6 for four months. it is a great car and excellent value for the money compared to MB,BMW and Lexus. I've put 6500 miles on the car and the only thing that I don't like about the car is the jittery, bumpy ride on uneven roads, it is fine on the highways and on smooth streets. I live in South Florida and the secondary roads here are pretty good compared to areas that get bad weather, however any imperfection on a road and this car goes into convulsions. I've complained to the dealer and basically the said there is nothing they can do about it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>tech package, awesome audio system, great gas mileage for a 375HP V8,awesome engine and trans. fit and finish inside and out. Changed the emblems and wheel center caps to the wings, many people think that it's a baby Bentley.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At first glance it looks like a lot for the money but on closer inspection the interior is cheaply constructed, you cannot transfer the phone book from your cell phone and the seats have no real lateral support. But all of this pales in the face of the terrible suspension. The ride is rough and jittery with a tendency towards porpoising on almost all surfaces, even those that appear to be smooth and or recently paved. I would test drive the heck out of a potential purchase and if you experience the slightest bit of what I have described, pass on it and look at something else. No other car that I have driven in recent years, of any price point, has these awful ride characteristics. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a past owner of BMWs, Infiniti & Mercedes. I never thought I would own a Korean automobile until I test drove this car. Hands down the Genesis is the best car I have owned. For the first time I feel like I bought a car where the performance, quality, & amenities match the price. Test drive this car & I bet you won't be able to forget the experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Having owned virtually every German and Japanese make on the market, I decided in today's economy, practicality should win out over creature comforts and German engineering. After owning a Genesis 3.8 for just one week, I am convinced that while my decision was certainly practical, I will not lose out on creature comforts, performance or quality. This car is an absolute winner and every time I get into it, I smile knowing that it will cost me less than half the cost of my E320 over the life of the car and I can honestly say that it has better features, comfort, style and performance. This car is a winner and if Hyundai can get the suspension right, they will really be on to something big.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tech System Navigation is second to none, sound system and bluetooth handsfree system is far superior to Toyota and Benz. The car looks great from all angles and is very comfortable on long trips.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Who would have thought that you could spend $40,000 and drive out of a dealership and own a world class automobile that rivals the 750-I BMW. The electronics alone are amazing but the car has good power with the V-8 and rides very smooth. It also is very roomy and handles great. I bought a Mercedes E-350 in 2006 for more money.This care is quality. Trust me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So today I went to Power Hyundai in Scottsdale AZ for my first service. My NAV/Radio were fine. They tried to apply the T63 update and after three tries quit because the second DVD of 3 was rejected. The technicians called Hyundai tech support all day and got no response from the tech people. My radio is OK but NAV stopped working and all works Verrrrry slooooowly. They promise to get this fixed. My beef is with Hyundai tech support. What right do they have not to call back all day to a dealership needing help? I called the consumer line and was told by the only person I could reach that he would call a regional manager- obviously a useless ploy. Hyundai needs to get organized/return calls!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rides very well. Comfortable. Plenty of power in six cylinder. Nav/radio were perfect until they screwed it up and HYUNDAI did not return calls.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have just had my Genesis since Jan 17/2009. It beats the heck out of my Chrysler 300 (2005) by a mile. I looked at Nissan Maxima, Altima, Lincoln, Buick, Cadillac and they did not even come close. The car is superb.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great looking, fun to drive and dripping with technology. I am 6'7" and fit comfortably in this vehicle. My vehicle is pearl back with tan leather interior and is a head turner. I can't tell you how many times I get asked "what is that?" - of course once they are told it is the standard response - THAT is a Hyundai. If you are in the market for luxury sedan, you owe it to yourself to test drive the Genesis.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Only having the car for less than a week makes it difficult to offer critique that might affect someone's buying decision. However, I am so impressed with how this car feels and performs that I am compelled to write something. Prior to making this purchase, I checked every available review, both professional and consumer, and I shopped every available source. When it became clear that this car was one that I should strongly consider, I agonized over whether I would buy a 3.8 or 4.6 variant. For the difference in price, I am happy with my choice although both cars are winners. I have owned a stable of fine cars over the years, and, Hyundai just didn't appeal to me...until now!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Lexicon stereo system melts the senses. The fuel economy for such a heavy, high-horsepower vehicle is absolutely amazing. The absence of noise of any kind is a true delight, and, the way this car 'feels' its way around the road is eerily similar to a Porsche I once owned. The 'gawk' factor!!!!</FAVORITE>
