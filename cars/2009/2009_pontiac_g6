<TEXT>I have had this car for 4 months now and am very happy. The car rides exceptionally well, is fun to drive, and smooth on the freeway. The 4-cyl engine is adequate for my needs and gets fairly good gas mileage. I love the sunroof and the car looks great with the rear spoiler. This is my first car with Onstar and the navigation turn by turn directions are very convenient, especially when looking for a particular restaurant around town. Overall, this car has great value and I'm pleased with my purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my new car on October 3rd and it has 53 miles on it and it broke down on me on October 4th. It was the fuel pump. I am very upset that a brand new car broke down the 2nd day I had it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>recvd car as a rental. It it a very fun to drive car, seats are ok. Driving for long distance is uncomfortable due to too much hard plastic around doors. this car is proof of why American car companies have difficulty competing. After Buying Toyota for my past 2 vehicles. I am not conviced by this to buy anything else. The build Quality is just not there. Car Feels to "cheap". </TEXT>

<TEXT>Only owned the car for six weeks but it has been great so far. The relatively long wheelbase, for a car in this class, provides excellent ride. Owing to the fat 225/50-17 tires, taunt but compliant suspension and good steering response I, admittedly not a street racer, haven't found the limits of this car, yet. From what I've experienced, however, I expect the G6 to perform well in an emergency evasive maneuver. I'm 6'2" and found the back seat headroom to be adequate and the legroom quite impressive. Originally attracted by the clean, smooth styling and rake of the roofline. Really like the taupe leather interior, heated seats and security of OnStar. 31 mpg so far on a couple trips.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Driver information system integrated controls and display thru radio: Simple to operate and easy to view.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this after looking at the Ford, Nissan, Chevy, and Hyundai models that compete. With the $3,200 GM rebate and the $4,500 "clunker cash" rebate, we drove out way below the other models. Only 600 miles on it so far. Suspension seems tight, handling is sporty, interior is gorgeous, exterior is very appealing. Getting 25 mpg in town. Have not been on the interstate yet. Love the XM satellite radio and the built-in phone. Also have the OnStar. Just touch a button to activate the phone and speak out the number! Wonderful machine. Our 3rd Pontiac and loving it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM radio; hands-free phone; OnStar system; sporty ride and handling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my car, poor gas mileage, wish there were other extras, such as memory seats, warning buzzer when backing up, warning buzzer when a car is in you blind spot. I also miss a compass. Blue tooth can only connect to one carrier service.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I replaced my old truck with the G6. Dealer gave great incentives plus CARS program $3500. Leather interior is comfortable, sunroof works great. Like the 4-cylinder for smoothness and enough power. Getting 32 MPG on the highway at 65 MPH. Plenty of room for me (6'3', 250 lbs.) in back seat. The radio is okay - Works well with my iPod. Happy with it so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first convertible. I love the hardtop convertible. Can't figure out why GM chose to drop the Pontiac line.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Definitely the hardtop convertible is the best feature. So many ragtops look like rags after only a few years. The car is extremely quiet with the top up, and surprisingly quiet with the top down, at least in the front seat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is fun to drive. The engine is powerful. It kinda lack stability when you take of fast. The exterior looks really good, but the interior lacks a lot of options. GM need to step their game up a notch with the pontiac interior. if you want a luxury car, don't buy this. If you want a car with options, don't buy it either. buy the pontiac if you like a smooth sport ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>exterior looks great, performance, interior red light and the smooth drive</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I guess I'm a little heart broken at the lack of quality materials in the interior of the G6. The leather is so thin, I'm almost afraid to touch it. The fact that the sports package included only half electric seats and a horrible handle to move the seats back and forth just floors me. I drove a 99 Olds Intigue GLS with all the bells and whistles, this just doesn't compare. Why did I buy it, Classic exterior look, great engine,good deal for the money,and the fact that GM is GM, and I wanted to stay American with some style.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am currently renting this car. Overall its a very dissapointing car. I normally drive an 2007 Audi a4 and given my A4 only cost me about 5k more then a new G6 GT it feels about 100% better in terms of interior quality, handling and overall build quality. The only thing I am impressed with is the 3.5 V6 which feels a lot stronger then the 219 HP its putting out. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine pulls very strong from 2000- 5000 RPM. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased my G6 Coupe brand new. Love it. It has a heavy ride (which I prefer!) The gas mileage is good considering I don't break 35 mph on my 4 mile drive to work. The interior leaves a lot to be desired....way too much plastic. And I wish the seats sat up straighter. They need one more notch to sit up all the way. One other thing....There are too many cup holders in the car too. I'd rather have an armrest in the back. LOVE the exterior....especially the back!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wife wanted a convertible, moving from Infiniti G35 coupe. She wanted hard top so that really limited selection. No, the G6 isn't a G35, but it also costs about 30-35% less. That said, the G6 is still plenty car to get person from point A to point B with plenty of pick-up and go. In Midwest, being able to drive in snow is even more a necessity than dropping the top in summer, G6 handles GREAT in snow with stock tires. G6 is sporty, functional and fun to drive - can't wait for summer. No problems.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive, sporty, great performance, decent back seat space (especially for a convertible).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have an Accord. I got this car as a rental while my Accord was in the shop for a few weeks. Wow. Did Pontiac ever try out other cars? The seats were uncomfortable. There was no place to put my sunglasses. Only 2 cup holders. None in the back seats. It has a horrible turning radius. The engine was very nice. Overall, you can do much better than this.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine was responsive and powerful.</FAVORITE>
