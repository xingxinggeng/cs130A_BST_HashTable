<TEXT>Overall a great car. This is my second Infiniti, first being the g35. This is a big step forward. The car is beautiful both in and out. Very comfortable and fun to drive. I looked at this as well as the BMW 335i and walked away with this car mostly based on price. Being nit picky, I will say that the car needs just a little more refinement in the brakes and engine department. The brakes are very touchy. not too smooth. The engine is great but you feel the shifts too much. There is also a good 2 to 2.5 second delay between pedal mash and power to the wheels at highway speed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine. Sound. Steering wheel controls.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first time I have Inifiniti G37 Coupe, it was fun to drive... a good horse power, but it's for sure not a gas friendly car, I have seen avg 14Mpg to max 20 Mpg, and the sport model type have a noisy tires until you get used to it. Small seats, it's made for big people. It has a good features. I'm enjoying it but I won't buy it again if I was asked to buy it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, and features like navigation system, bluetooth, play mp3 music.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great car overall, but the clutch pedal is a bit too heavy for regular city stop and go driving. I live in Philly and all Infiniti dealers are located in the suburbs. The suburban test drive and the back roads that showed off the handling really didn't reveal how tiring the clutch pedal would become in the city environment where I reside. I have a 2006 Honda Element with manual trans that is a pleasure to drive in the city with its light clutch and precise shift action. It's very, very similar to the BMW 3 Series that I recently test drove. If I could have driven the Infiniti in the city for a day or two I probably would not have purchased it despite its other wonderful virtues.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This is a very high quality car in nearly all respects. Nav is easy to use and the Premium pkg stereo sounds great. Fantastic handling and acceleration with no squeaks or rattles. Shift action is short and precise.</FAVORITE>

Dream car and only 20 dollars more for insurance from accord coupe to G37. Buy it and you won't regret!! I love it and I would just sit in there for like hours and smile like stupid.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just had a 07 G35 and "upgraded" to the 09 G37 & couldn't be happier. The 09 has a bit more acceleration, better hwy MPG and the deals they're offering it's the best bang for the buck in performance sedans right now. The 7 spd Auto in the 09 (compared to the 5 spd in the 07-08) really helps w/ fuel economy. I've already noticed a 2mpg increase on the hwy and the motor isn't really broken in yet. The 7 spd tends to hunt a bit more for gears in speeds under 30 mph but I know there's a Tech service bulletin to have a trans reflash to smooth the shifts, so that'll be taken care of. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling is perfect, doesn't scream "look at me" like the Cadillac CTS or Pontiac G8, just very sporty & classy. Decent trunk space for being rather short in the tail. The illuminated kick plates are a nice touch and helpful at night. The Bose premium sound system is quite impressive w/ nice clarity.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Turned in my FX45 on this new G37xS. It is stunning. The driving experience is pretty incredible. The comfort is quite good, the features are very complete, the size and packaging are good, and the electronics are excellent. As you would expect, the performance envelope is outstanding. Excellent power throughout the rev range. Brakes are strong and easy to modulate. Handling is responsive and sporting without being at all punishing. After 2 months and about 4000 miles I love this car. My G is fully optioned and very comfortable. Not a single item on the punchlist for the dealer. Everything works as it should and fits properly. My MPG to date is about 19, but my foot is heavy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The NAVI/BOSE is fantastic. With the hard drive audio I always have about 100 cds at my fingertips. Better still is the throttle response -- pretty much all up and down the dial. Lots of gitty-up. Especially fun in the wet as the AWD puts the power down just fine. A Screaming Value. A Best Buy!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am the proud owner of this 2009 G37 and so far I love it. I try to find excuses to go somewhere just so I can drive it. This car is FAST. I have to be careful so I don't get a ticket. I usually keep it in "D" mode to tame the horses and for better fuel economy. I average about 22mpg in city driving. The navigation and premium packages were well worth the upgrade. This car is just a dream to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation system is outstanding, bluetooth works flawlessly, power and interior design. I also like the fact that I can keep the keys in my pocket while locking, unlocking, and starting the car. I love the exhaust note and the power in this car is unbelievable. Backup camera is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Moonlight White G37S with Premium/Navigation/Sport/Technology/4- wheel Active Steering packages Just brought this home. I had been shopping around since February. Looked at the BMW 335, Audi A4, Mercedes C300, Lexus IS350/ES350, Volkswagen Passat and CC. After all was said and done, the bang for the buck was clearly with the 09 G37. The most impressive part of the car's performance isn't necessarily the 0-60 time (although it is nice). I find that its ability to get up and go when already at highway speeds to get around slower traffic and put safe distance between you and others has to be experienced to be fully appreciated.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Infiniti (loyal Lexus owner) and I am happy with my choice! I feel this is the best hard-top convertible for the money. It looks great with the top up or down. Considered and drove a BMW 335 Convertible and a Lexus IS 350 Convertible. Did not like the looks of the Lexus and the BMW was $8000 more WITHOUT a Nav system and other features on the Infiniti. PLUS the dealership was FRIENDLY and took GREAT care of me. Overall, I would highly recommend this to someone looking for the perfect blend of luxury, sportiness and value. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Other than the great looks--the Nav system, back up camera, Bose speakers in the headrests, comfortable ventilated/heated seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looking and researching the G's from the previous body style I took a dive for this one, and believe me, it's 180 degree turn from their previous model. Like said before, gotta get the packages. I have the 4wheel active steer pkg (takes corners at whatever speed without body role... good investment), premium, navigation, tech pkg (intelligent cruise control). The shifting and acceleration is as sporty and amazing as driving a little 2dr lotus!! Braking is as smooth and effective as a $100K automobile... and the best part, it's a quiet, sleek, quality car... without shouting for attention like the MB, BMW etc! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Short throw shifter (6MT) and acceleration beat many "sports" cars out there. Braking is phenomenal, and there's no roll, while taking corners faster. Job well done on the 4wheel Steering. Voice activated features like phonebook, address etc.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought a BMW 328XI coupe a few months ago in error and now made the change to the G37X. Though the mistake cost me, it was well worth it. The difference between the two cars and the value you get with the G37 made the change something that I had to do. Though the 328XI is a fine car, it does not have the road manners of the G37X. I have always wanted the G37X and I waited for the AWD to become available in the coupe. This car is a monster on the road, the ride is perfectly smooth, the quality of the ride is perfect and the performance is impeccable. Infiniti is number one with me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my convertible for over a month. I have been waiting for it since Feb. I LOVE everything about it, except the cuphold situation-- or more accurately, the lack of good cupholders. I ordered the manual version and test drove the automatic. Different cupholders! Also, my average gas mileage is about 17.1 mpg. I would love to get the advertised 19-21mpg. I'm still learning all the features to the car, but I am totally enjoying the navigation system and phone/iPod connection. Also, the speakers in the headrest is the best. I will say that the Lexus has more trunk space with the top down than the Infiniti. I only have room for an umbrella and a baseball hat in the trunk.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The more I drive my G37S Sedan, the more I love it. In my opinion, it blows the Mercedes C-Class away, destroys the Audi A4, and is $10,000 less than the BMW 335i comparably equipped. That said, it is a great combination of utility and performance. The G37 is fast in a straight line and also a great handling car. Impressively, it feels much lighter than it actually is. While the G37 is very capable of good gas mileage, it is incredibly difficult to fight the temptation to hammer the throttle. Hence, gas mileage can be an issue if you have a lead foot. In short, bravo Infiniti. You have created a great mix of performance and luxury for a reasonable cost.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Doesn't get any better than this. Coming from a Ford Explorer to an Infiniti is like eating spam for 4 years and then moving up to caviar! I checked out the Mercedes C Class, the Acura TL, Lexus IS and BMW 3 Series and none of them comparable to what my Infiniti is. The handling is great, it's F-A-S-T for a sedan and has everything I need. Other people complained that the doors not locking automatically but mine do so maybe it's just the Journey model that does so. If I could change anything, I would have gotten the model with all the bells and whistles (Nav, Bluetooth, etc.) but again, I was coming from an Explorer lol.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seats. With my back problems, it feels like the seat cuffs my back in all the right places. Push button start is very convenient, I also like the automatic reminders for service. So many good things to mention and so little space to mention them...just go drive one!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having driven a 2006 G35 coupe for the past 3+ years, I thought the new G37 coupe was an obvious choice when looking for a new car. I would get the driving experience I LOVED from the old car and more gadgets and features than an electronics show in Vegas. I was sorely mistaken. The transmission in this car searches for gears like Indiana looking for the Holy Grail. The steering is so loose that any imperfection in the pavement sends it all over the road. Driving it is a maddening endeavor; I feel like I am always trying not to break it or push it over the edge!!! I have called the dealer and while they assure me this is normal operation, I have an appointment for Friday. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Like other posters, I researched/test drove so many vehicles before finally taking the plunge on the G. None could compare to Infiniti's styling, comfort, power, technology, and VALUE! I had to have the premium package and navi. The navigation system in this car is awesome---one of the best on the market. The toys on the inside--- bluetooth, ipod connector, back up camera really appeal to my techie side. The jump from 0-60 will make your heart flutter. The interior leather is supple and the car is simply striking on the road. Be prepared---people will stare! I just cannot say enough about this car. Infiniti---keep doing what you're doing. Customer for life!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation, rear view monitor, Bluetooth, and Ipod connector. For those of you saying your Ipod won't charge---this car was not built in time for some of the newer generation Ipods/Iphones. You need an adaptor. Try the SCOSCHE PASSPORT IPOD/IPHONE CHARGING ADAPTOR.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this car for 3 months, 2000 miles. Overall, great car. Comfortable, good performance, great fit and finish. Getting 20-21 mpg mostly city driving. Nitpicks... While the seating is comfortable, the head room is tight. Unless I sit near the bottom of seat height adjustment, my heads hits the roof, I'm 5' 11". Bose radio is good, not great. Transmission lower gears are not well matched, winds up to quickly going, jerky when slowing down. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was shopping around for a new car and did extensive research on sedans in the same class. Lexus IS, Audi A4, Acura TL, Benz C Class, etc. After test driving the Infiniti, I was sold. This car has got the most powerful standard engine in its class and it makes it such an amazing machine to drive. 0-60 in a little over 5 seconds. Gotta love it! At the same time, the brakes make stopping feel effortless so that you're confident driving such a strong car. Lastly, the interior is beautiful and classy. I have no regrets in buying this car and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an excellent four-door sports car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, an excellent choice! This car is FAST! And it has all the features you would ever want. I got the Premium and Navi which are a must have for a lux car. Way better than BMW 3 series and more stylish than the TL. Old G series was boring, but I love the new design, 7 speed AT, and 328 HP! Interior is great and comfortable (BMW interior is boring -- leatherette for a lux car? Are you kidding me?) TL is bigger but not as fast and not as pretty on the outside. I thought about getting a Maxima, but heck, it's almost the same price, so why not get the G37? With the confidence of Inifinti reliability, I am one happy camper.</TEXT>

I heard someone say that the display was hard to see but I don't get that at all. I think the cabin is well designed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Coming from a '06 G35 6MT sedan (w/ sport and premium) - I thought I would miss the VLSD and 6MT. The 7AT and VQ37VHR more than make up for it. This engine is more powerful and more refined. The power band is excellent, and power is always ready. I love being in 7th gear, and doing 2600 rpm at 80mph - averaging over 29MPG. The cabin is quieter over the G35, and feels roomier. My sun shade from the G35 fits on the G37, BONUS!! I was looking at the ISF, C63, G8 GXP, and 330. I wanted a sporty sedan that wasn't too big. The e55 would have been too big. The G37 gave me everything I wanted, at a wonderful price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did an extensive research for a while. I was comparing a couple of cars: BMW 328i, Infiniti G37, and MB C350. Eventually I went for G37. After driving 1500 miles, I'm glad I made a right decision. This is an incredible driving machine with tons of power under hood. The curb turning is really great and better than 328i. I feel so thrilled whenever I do 0-60mile acceleration. This is the best entry luxury sports sedan by far. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I cross-shopped the 328i (xDrive), TL-SHAWD, A4 2.0, and IS-250AWD. None of them came close to offering the same blend of performance, handling, features, technology, and usability as the G37xS. The engine is extremely powerful (pulling away with four passengers up a hill is still easy to elicit a "Whoa" from everyone on board), the chassis handling BMW-like (read: near-perfect), the technologies (voice control, music box, swiveling headlights, laser cruise, traffic gps, etc. etc.) both cool and easy-to-use, the seats bolster you in like some high-luxe sport cars, and the overall experience is extremely satisfying and fun.</TEXT>

I also have a 08 911TT Cab so I know cars and power etc. The fit and finish is excellent and the interior is great. Some people criticize the 7speed auto, but honestly, I don't know why and the same goes for the interior. One feature that is cool is the music box with the 9+ GB harddisk. At first I thought it was worthless, but once you have loaded in all your CDs, no more carrying around CDs. If you have to have more status, want to pay thousands more and get less, then by all means buy a Lexus or BMW. The dealer treats you like a king, no begging for loaner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Infiniti. My last vehicle was a Cayenne, however, I wanted to shed myself of an SUV while maintaining the versatility of AWD. I decided on the g37x coupe based on the reliability and performance factor of my previously owned Infiniti FX 35. My FX never, and I mean never, went back to the dealership. I had the oil changed every 3,000 miles at my local service station. I test drove the BMW 335x and could not justify spending the difference in price for a comparable car. The g37 coupe is comfortable, handles well and has insane acceleration. The standard feature list far surpasses any of its competitors from Germany. I would definitely buy it again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great all-around luxury/sports sedan. Plenty of power is there throughout the powerband. Transmission responds when you want it to, yet is smooth in nearly all driving conditions. All- wheel drive is great in rainy conditions and light snow. Getting around 23-27 mpg in city and highway mix with normal driving habits (depending on the mix of city verses highway miles and how hard I drive the car). Recently got 31.2 mpg with cruise set at 58 mpg on eastern shore of MD! Handling is great without S trim - no need to upgrade unless you really want a bit more performance for the extra $. Nice standard technology and luxury with more toys and comfort features available if you want them. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Considering the power this car has, the added weight of the x trim, and the car's size, the gas mileage is very good! I owned a 2004 G35x previously. Even though it was overall a very good car, the G37x is better in every way but one. The G37x requires premium fuel, the G35x recommended premium.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Spent 17 months meticulously reading reviews and test driving every car in the entry level luxury class, plus many other categories, before selecting the G37X coupe. Although I bought the car this May, I test drove it during a Michigan snow storm, and have a strong impression of its road grip-handling during both good and very poor road conditions. This car is superb by all measures. It's exterior lines are eye catching and interior refinements are topnotch. Fuel economy is better than I had anticipated, as I'm averaging 21 MPG of mostly city driving. Not too shabby! This car is awesome. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just turned in a 2006 FX. I loved that car because it had versatility and handled like a sports sedan. When I went back to the Infiniti dealership to check out an '09 FX, the new version just didn't whet my appetite. Too exotic maybe. I test drove a G37X and wow! Now that's a sports sedan! I gave up some storage and SUV driving height, but came away with a rocket ship on wheels, that is as tight as a drum. I had test driven a BMW 328X also and this car is as tight as that but with ample more power. The 328 is not even in the same class power wise.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I admit, I am very picky when it comes to spending my money. All I am wondering is How can they make G37 so perfect!! Handling - precise. Power - Like you got a nuclear slab under your hood [Like Iron Man :P], Interiors - Better than competitors [Lexus had better]. Looks - I love it. Size - Bigger than competitors. G all the way!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Every feature that I am aware of. Power, Handling, complete response, technology - Intelligent cruise control, sports seats, paddle shifters, AWD technology, Backup camera and many more... </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking for a fun car in addition to my FX35. I test drove Audi TT, BMW 335ix and the 370Z. The G37x gives me best value and comfort and I can always count on the Infiniti quality. I based my final decision on a combination of these factors - performance, comfort/toys, fun to drive, value and reliability.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I am impressed with the high tech toys with the G37x. The Navi system is the best in the industry along with voice recognition. It is actually pretty quiet and comfortable to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I initially wanted a CTS. The G37x for me was the best value, has excellent expected reliability (3rd year in production also tends to work out some early-production bugs), and leaves the other cars in the dust when it comes to acceleration. My numerical ratings may have been overly harsh, but when you look at its competitors (not considering price), the G37x is a bit rough around the edges.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powertrain response is much better than when it had the 5-spd trans. Handling is pretty good, although at street-legal speeds I like my '04 Mazada6 better. I'm sure at track speeds the G37 will blow it away. All the buttons/switches are where you expect them, so it took minimal time to learn them.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first entry level luxury car and I must admit I am glad I chose this rocket ship. The G37 is gorgeous, has ridiculous power, handles awesome and is a stunner to look at. I forgot to mention I saved at least 100 in lease price compared to 4 cylinder audi, and also way more than 100 for a 335 bmw. The interior is amazing, the drive is comfortable and the power is insane. The AWD is incredible you can do 70 mph off the highway without hearing a thing.It's just an incredible machine.G37 4ever.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for just over a month and we (my wife and I love it). I had a hard time choosing between the 3 series and the G37 but my wife made the decision easy because she preferred the G37 interior. The navigation and premium package was a must and because we hadn't bought a new car recently, the blue tooth and backup camera were nice features. What got us to the dealership though was predicted RELIABILITY and we chose Infiniti based on my wife's positive experience with Nissan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I moved to Minnesota from AZ a while ago and wanted to purchase a AWD vehicle. After an exhaustive search I chose the G37x and could not be happier. I thought I would miss my BMW 3 series but I am surprised to say I don't. It is a different drive but as a daily commuter way outclasses my old car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove TL S-AWD, BMW 335 X drive, and G37 X. BMW 335 gave me the best driving experience in terms of acceleration, handling, brakes, and comfort. G37 was good too but not as good as BMW. I bought the G37 because I got 6 grand off MSRP and it's roomier inside. I'm sure it's a lot more reliable than BMW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I shopped for some time comparing cars-planned on a BMW but the $9000 diff was too much to contend with. The character of the car is amazing. It's a rocket when you want it or a quiet cruiser. Went to the dealer for a coupe came out with a sedan with no regrets. The engine is the MOST responsive I have owned- quick revving. The transmission is great. I have noticed that it does well in just about every situation except for quick stops - can't shift down fast enough I guess. Otherwise it has aggressive shifting pattern that I prefer - smooth and determined. Personally I think the car is under rated always compared to BMW when $ and reliability really make it the better choice. Biased reviews?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The G37's have extensive features. I like the ipod interface and the information screen. The control is easy. I tried the iDrive and it had multi-level menus this is better. My favorite? Intelligent key by far. I like keeping the key in my pocket. The steering is great and of course the power. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car has a real nice ride to it and so far I'm very happy with my purchase. I haven't had it that long to really comment on the mpg but so far it's about as advertised. I only have 2 complaints about the car, 1) when you take your foot off the gas and the car begins to slow down it has a rough downshift from 3rd to 2nd. Not something you'd expect from an auto. 2) the brake pads give off way too much brake dust.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Comfortable driver's seat, plenty of room in front, great features. Rear seats are a bit tight but the rear headroom is fine. Handles, steers, stops and accelerates extremely well and is very fun to drive. The controls for bluetooth, nav, climate and audio features are intuitive and easy to use. The backup camera is fantastic. Gas mileage is not great, but it's a heavy car with 328 hp so that's to be expected. Very solid construction and well executed interior. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had this car about a month with 1800 miles on it and I love it. It's the best of both worlds, you can just cruise or drive it hard and it responds flawlessly no matter what! The 7AT helps with the gas mileage and is fun to drive in the manual mode! Coming from a Maxima I expect the same reliability as well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first all-wheel drive car. In the past I was a rear-drive enthusiast - I've owned 3 BMW's and most recently a 2003 Infiniti G35S. The ride is top quality and the car is one of the best I have driven. I was initially concerned that the weight of the AWD would hurt the handling and acceleration. The impact is really minimal vs. the S version, but I live in the snow belt. Even on an icy road, it's very hard to spin the wheels - great traction! I was also concerned that the sport seats would be a bit tight, but after driving for a few days, I was convinced that they are an excellent choice (unless you are over 210 lbs.). Overall, I am very pleased.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent driving car. Excellent features. Mileage is better than expected (average 21.8 in mostly city driving over about 4000 miles). Got 27 on recent highway trip (avg. about 75 mph). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking for a pre-owned Lexus GS350 or M35x Infiniti but ran into trouble finding low mileage examples and the new ones were too expensive. I actually thought the Ininiti G and the Lexus IS were too small. One day while waiting to test drive a pre-owned M the sales rep suggested I test drive a new G. I did and it was love at first drive. It is one of the most solid cars I have ever driven, has plenty of power and all of the controls for the Nav, sound system, phone, etc are extremely easy to use. Once you get to use the controls a short time you can figure out how to use all of the functions without referring to an instruction booklet. This car is more than a 3 series and much cheaper!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power, the sound of the exhaust, the sport seats, the solid feel of the car, great nav system and extremely well thought out easy to use controls. Lots of bang for the buck!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Test drove an Audi A4, Acura TL, BMW 328 and Lexus ES 350. I found the G37x the best combination of performance, comfort and value. This car is fun to drive. I've owned it for a couple of months now, and I still look forward to driving it. I couldn't decide if I should upgrade to the high tech package, but I am very happy I did. The high tech package adds to the overall enjoyment of driving this car. After reading about how poor the fuel efficiency is, I was not expecting much. While it's certainly not great, its not that bad. Unless your expectations are for something that would cost tens of thousands more, you will not be disappointed with this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just turned in my leased 2006 M35 and picked up a new 2009 G37xS Sedan. I am very pleased! This car is much sportier, has 48 more horses than the M, and is a blast to drive. The steering is much tighter and with the all-wheel drive it sticks to the road in dry, rainy, or snowy weather. The sport model comes with the paddle shifters and 18" alloy wheels. Very nice look in the new Moonlight White color. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car surprised me. I stopped in to test the G and the M35 as well, but was shocked by the superior handling of the G. I drove the 328, A4 and CTS, but this was superior, especially considering it's the stock setup. Only 500 miles so I haven't tested everything in the NAV pkg yet. Quality construction, handling, steering, quietness, styling and power come for a competition-beating price and make this car a winner. Fuel mileage looks grim, but we'll see after more tanks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my 2009 Journey sedan. This thing is fast and handles really well. The dials and controls are mostly intuitive. I like that you don't have to use the scroll wheel to control the stereo and climate controls. The voice commands for the Bluetooth integration work pretty well, but some of the prompts are a little long to get through.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned many vehicles including the KING of performance, the ULTIMATE DRIVING MACHINE and yes the Bimmers are a blast to drive they just lack all of the other stuff you would expect when you are purchasing a luxury vehicle. Simply the Infiniti G37 gives you the performance of the Bimmer but for a whole lot less and ten times more technology and features you cannot even get on the BMW. I know, I know, people always say if you can afford a BMW then money really is not an issue but in this day and age $10k is still $10k. Unless you must have those three letters in your driveway, get the Infiniti G37xS and if you want to blow $10k buy some GM stock.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted something fast, two doors, manual transmission and AWD, and arrived at the Infiniti after eliminating all the competition. Felt like I got 80% of what I wanted, and getting that other 20% would have cost more than double. Even though the Infiniti was the least expensive thing on my list, I'm happy with it and have no regrets. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>iPod integration (bravo!), fast, solid and "sticky" feeling. Honorable mention to the Bluetooth integration and for going to a touch-screen nav system (last one I looked at forced you do use the silly wheel). </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>My First Infiniti</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I had been looking for cars for quite a while and was really looking forward to the new A4 after test driving almost everything. This new G37 may not look like it but it is a great evolution of the G35 Last spring I rented a G35 while on vacation but felt that my B5 S4 was superior after the rental. The gas pedal was very touchy and the transmission had a mind of it's own. This G37xS feels so solid that it's hard to believe it's based on the same car that I drove 8 months ago. Anyone considering a BMW should take a G37 for a test drive and try to deny the primal thrill that this V6 delivers at redline. You should buy this car because it sounds so much better than it's competition.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>As a previous Audi owner I must say that ATTESSA is superior. Interior is right up there with Audi. The engine sounds and feels very good. The front sport facia is beautiful but there are no pictures of it at Infiniti. The multi media interface is simple and logical. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I looked for quite a while before I ordered my G37xS. I was a big 3 letter fan (BMW) but after I drove the 2008 G35, I was sold. I began to read about the improvements that were coming for 2009 and ordered one as early as I could. The AWD Sport is fantastic. I love the paddle shifters. The car handles very well and it accelerates so smoothly that you barely feel the shifts. The fit and finish are great. I am a big guy and I fit quite comfortably. Everyone talks about the value and I agree, this car is better than every car priced below $65K. The more other cars I drove, the more it made my decision clearer. I have 3,000 miles on it and loved driving every one of them. Fantastic vehicle!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>New engine - 3.7L VVT is outstanding. Great acceleration and power. New transmission - 7 speed is great with the new engine. Perfect combination. Navigation system - best system available. Ground effects in front. Paddle shifters. Music box. AWD - already tested on ice and snow. Flawless.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was in the market for an entry level luxury sport sedan for 6 months. All I kept hearing was how great the BMW 3 series was. So I test drove it. While a great performer, the interior felt "boring", and the run flat tires were very loud. So I waited a few more months for the G37 to come out. I'm very glad I waited. Infiniti was always trying to catch up to the 3 series in terms of performance and styling, and it seems that they finally caught up. To me, it out performs the BMW, with a much more luxurious interior. Plus it's got more ponies (330 vs 300). Let's not even mention the $10k I saved by going with the G. This is the car for the driving enthusiast that wants the performance and luxury</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Infiniti did a great job with the new engine and tranny. They desperately needed to upgrade to a 7 speed tranny, and add some power to the V-6. I love this car inside and out. The interior screams $50k luxury car. The layout and navi is great, and the seats are comfy. The AWD will help in Chicago</FAVORITE>

This car is quick, sporty, luxurious, handles like a dream and has all the toys you could want. It definitely stands out in a crowd with its looks and keeps you pampered on the inside.
