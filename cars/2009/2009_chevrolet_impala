<TEXT>Car rides better than my 2007 Impala. The stereo is better as well. Only complaint is (as someone else pointed out) the angle of the headrest is not as comfy as it could be. I drive very carefully and have been averaging 29-30 mpg city. Would recommend the car to anyone looking for a midsize sedan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>One of the roomiest cars I have owned in a long time. I am as comfortable in this car as I am in my Silverado Pick-up. I am over 6' tall and it is one of the few cars I have been in that I can't reach the pedals with the seat all the way back. Dealership was great. For the price, warranty and dealer support you cannot beat it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth, Driver information system is amazing, even has tire pressure monitors! Bose stereo is fantastic. Trunk is huge.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got the LT with luxury pkg. Love the smooth ride and handling. The interior looks great.Drove 600 mile trip the first week and go over 30mpg. The trunk space is awesome,esp. with the folddown rear seats. Can handle 4 golf bags. The Bose sound system is amazing,esp with the XM music. OnStar with the turn-by-turn option is wonderful,eliminates the need for GPS. Would recommend getting the upgrade package as it eliminates 90% of the complaints mentioned in the other reviews.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I loved my 06 300C. It was one of my best cars,but gas won"t stay 2 bucks a gal. I looked at mostly GM cars and always liked the Impala,the SS would be great but I wanted better mileage. I read some of Edmunds reviews and I thought that some were critical of the interior. I believe that was because of buying the lower model. I am very happy with the leather seats and the way they sit. I have 18 inch wheels and the handling pkg {both std on LTZ} and car handles as good as my 300. It does have a little stiffer ride but you can't have both ways. The 3.9 V-6 has plenty of power for all my driving and the first tank of gas{mostly city with some hwy driving avg 23.5</TEXT>

<TEXT>Nice car - good power with nice interior overall. Head rests were to far forward and the chrome around the gear selector sometimes reflected sun in my eyes. I did hear a slight squeak near the windshield on the drivers side.</TEXT>

<TEXT>They had to dig the car out of the back of the warehouse. I wanted a light interior color with a dark exterior. They came up with Red Jewel Tintcoat and tan leather interior. The color (when clean) is really pretty. It sparkles in the sun. I love it. I have Bose, heated seats and a moonroof. I enjoy it. I just wish the car had more chrome accents on it. The mileage is great and has pretty good acceleration for a small 6. I did not care about XM radio and let it lapse. How about HD radio? Steering wheel controls are great. Love the hands free phone and Onstar ability. One big negative is the headrest. It hits me in the middle of my head. They tried to adjust it but couldn't.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car for my wife and for trips. It rides comfortable getting good gas mileage on highway over 30 mpg and seems to do well in town. I liked my oldsmobile better but had more power and less gas mileage. I like that we got column shift and did not have to waste space for area between seats. Has good passing power, comfortable for long ride. I would have liked key lock on trunk, but know it is more secure this way. My wife is happy with it traded in Buick Ranier, if she is happy I am happy. Love the trunk space!</TEXT>

As for gas its good but you don't buy the ss model for gas mileage right. I really enjoy driving again. Oh and I drive all day at work. If you buy an impala get the ss you wont be disappointed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I rented this car when it was almost brand new, only had 300 miles on it. I drove it for about 500 miles. I wasn't very impressed by it. The gas pedal was extremely hard to push. The side mirrors are triangular in shape with less surface area than the oval ones I am used to. The interior is made of cheap plastic and the wood trim just emphasizes the car's cheapness. But overall, the car drove pretty well. I got about 30 mpg on highway driving. The steering was very responsive and the brakes stopped on the dime. Not a bad car, but it needs to improve in the areas I mentioned above.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got this care with 100 miles on it, new car...but it handles like a boat, you have to push the peddle in pretty dang hard to move the thing (i know its new but wow). also the things handles like a boat, i got caught by a cross wind and i did not move the steering wheel and the car starts swaying on the road like i moved the wheel, very uneasy. plus side is the interior is nice and there is plenty of room...other than that Chevy took a once awesome and fearsome car and turned it into the love boat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Even though I just bought an SS model I found it to be very comfortable and quiet during driving. Gas mileage appears to be fair for now and my only hang-up would be the call for 91 octane for the best mileage/performance. On-Star system is tops in my book and the entire radio system is more than enough for the average adult. General quality is MUCH improved from these guys and no door rattling of any kind.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my favorite car that I have ever owned! Combination of comfort and performance is just perfect. Fuel mileage is very good, considering there is 303 HP small block V-8 under the hood. I have significant back issues, and I am very comfortable after a couple hours in the drivers seat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is my worst nightmare. My friends said I downgraded from my 2000 buich century. In city, im loosing 8 mpg-on hwy-12-16 mpg. The steering is for a weightlifter--very difficult, hard. The high seats on passenger side& inside trim at rear, make blind spots, you cant see the cars coming on the right side. You ask--what about mirror? guess what, its so small, you can miss seeing traffic. Seats are very cheaply made, w/hardly any padding for comfort. And guess what---no glove box lock, or light to see, figure that. I was appealed by this car, by its looks, not as a car & don't want anyone to do this stupid action. If you take it home for 2 days---I promise you professionally--you will give it back.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Nice tan leather interior with heated seats and simulated wood on dash. Dark Molcha exterior. Lexus-like quietness and superb Bose stereo. Nice volume controls and scan on steering wheel. E- 85 capable, On-Star, rear seat folds flat; 3 things $40K Lexus doesn't have. Still proud to buy from the General. Clients I drive have commented on tight fit and finish. Makes a professional statement without being overly blatant or presumptuous. Plus makes a great family car on the weekend. Has 3 power plugs for my 2 phones and portable GPS. Nice easy to use controls for HVAC. Very logical and practical. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Huge trunk for my luggage and samples for my job. XM radio is a nice touch. Getting 32 MPG with cruise control while going through Iowa at 80 MPH. Rear spoiler helps with parking. I'm 6'4" and enjoy ample leg room although it's snug behind my seat. Over all, great value for price. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My husband and I drove almost every car before we purchased our 2008 Impala LTZ. I love it so much! The interior is beautiful, and the seats are really comfortable, I love my sun roof, and both of my boys have more than enough room in the back seat. The trunk is huge! We have an Eddie Bower stroller which is huge in itself and it fits in there with room to spare. We had to evacuate when hurricane Ike came through last year, we fit one pack&play, three suit cases, stroller, briefcase, big pack of diapers&wipes, small ice chest, dog food, toys, a portable baby swing, sheets and a comforter and it all fit, with more room in there. It drives so smooth and quiet! I recommend this to anyone!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Handsome car on the exterior, but the interior is just not up to snuff. The Impala is supposed to be Chevy's top family car and it falls flat by not offering options offered by other "lesser" cars. NO auto climate control, NO reversing sensors, NO HID headlamps! Come on! Even Hyundai offers these. And the handhold for the trunk pulldown is a joke. You can only lower the (dirty) lid with it and then you have to grab the outside of the trunk to push it the rest of the way down. Very bad design flaw. True, this is my 82 yr old mother's car and not mine, but I have to drive her in it. Whats nice is that Chevy still offers a column mounted gearshift option. That's what sold the car. Grade C</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my Impala after having bought 4 Nissan's over the years. I happen to drive one through our company fleet program. After, being laid off and recently re-employed I test drove another impala. You cannot beat the value, price and look. My experience at the dealership was excellent as well. No pressure! FYI, I used Edmunds before I went and paid below what everyone else is paying....Edmunds prepared me very well!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for three months and am generally satisfied. The gas mileage is excellent and the ride and handling are OK to good. The car is roomy. Outside visibility is somewhat hindered because of the door posts. No trouble so far. I would characterize this car as bland satisfactory basic transportation but other cars might offer more for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my car in March after owning an Altima and I absolutely love it! It came fully equipped with black leather seats, moon roof, spoiler, heated seats etc. I am so happy for choosing this car although all the extra stuff did sway my judgment a little! It rides very smooth and is very roomy inside. I have 3 children and it accommodates them perfectly. I would definitely recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>

It definitely serves the needs of my livelihood. Again, the interior design could use more work. For the most part, I am a satisfied buyer!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for almost a week now, and I wanted to take it back after a couple days. The interior has the cheapest materials I've ever seen...cheap plastic everywhere. Cupholders are way too small in front, Side mirrors are off a Cobalt (cheap and small). Steering wheel is thin and made of a cheap rubbery plastic. Dome lights are in terrible places, No auto-up on the driver's side power window, no lumbar, average sound system but nothing to brag about, fake wood tries to make interior look classy, but with the other cheap plastic all around, it fails. Gutless V6 engine, terrible shifter materials, no tiptronic, no lumbar in seat, no volume on steering wheel, etc, etc, etc.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for less than 2 months and I have had horrible neck & back pain the bulk of the time. Husband complained about the passenger seat on a 3 hr trip being uncomfortable as well. The head rest pushes your head forward and after intense arguments with the dealer, we were able to get written instructions on how to remove it and turn it around (Dealer would not touch it !) I'm now under the care of a chiropractor. Now I drive with a full size bed pillow just to make the 30 mile drive to work without pain. I love all its neat features, smooth & quiet ride, classy interior, but can't wait to park it and relieve my pain. Probably will sell or trade it soon.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Classy exterior & interior. Bluetooth is great, smooth & quiet ride, flip & fold rear seats are a great plus for hauling dogs and one that no other sedan has.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Althrough I've had this car for only a short time, less than three weeks, I did drive a 2008 Impala for a year (company car). Because of the pleasant experience with the '08 I decided to buy an '09 when I had to return the company car. However I find the 2009 to be extremely uncomfortable as compared with the 2008, specifically the lumbar. It doesn't deflate all the way as it should, and it really really hurts my back (and others who have driven my car). This seems to be the way it is on all 2009's. (No problem with the 2008's.) I've been told "this is the way it is" and nothing can be done. This flaw should be corrected but I suspect it will not be because it's not a safety issue.</TEXT>
