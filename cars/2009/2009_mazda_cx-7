<TEXT>Great combination of sport and utility. Hate to say interior looks nice but cheap quality material, winds noise and side mirror vibrates when drive more than 60 mph, found alot of blind spots. Back lights each set for 569.00 plus tax!!. Too much rounds to gas station after buying it. Purchased my '09 CX-7 AWD Sport (w/Leather)in July for USD 23000 OTD (out the door) and showed to my cousin and next month he bought 2010 (no leather) but with more nicer interior and options for 21,000 OTD same dealer, which makes me little sad. Fun to drive but be ready to get TICKET!!. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently bough the cx7 and am very happy with it. I really like the steering and the absence of body roll. The acceleration feels comfortable on the highway, but don't expect this to be a sportscar. There is plenty of room in the back for groceries or skis (when the seats are laid back). The rear seats are extremely easy to fold back. I also like the front bucket seats and the leather feels very good. The interior is way better than a Forrester or an accord. The few complaints that I have are fuel economy (for me that doesn't matter since I don't drive a lot). Also the bluetooth is useless. Also sometimes you can feels bumps on the road.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling is great. Styling and front seats are also way above average.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great combination of sport and utility. This is my 2nd CX-7. Purchased my '09 CX-7 AWD Sport(w/Bose and sunroof)in March after completing a short term lease on an '07. Perfect vehicle for a small family or an adventurous couple. It's a car(?) I love to drive on a daily basis and it's fantastic for road trips.(I mounted a trailer hitch on mine and we take our bicycles with us on our trips.) Mileage was quite poor on my '07, but I still bought my '09. Surprisingly mileage is better on my '09. I get around 18-19mpg in local driving and as much as 24mpg in pure highway driving(w/premium). For a little under 23K this is a CUV that could compete with more more expensive vehicles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great handling. Excellent braking. Bluetooth is awesome. Comfortable driving position.(I'm 6'4"-but nobody wants to sit behind me!!) Great Bose Stereo w/ Satellite Radio. Excellent utility. Security of AWD. Very good safety ratings.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my CX-7! Traded in a 2004 Mazda 6, wanted to go back to a SUV type vehicle but got the the best of both worlds with my CX-7 - drive's like a sports car with the upgraded comfort and appearance of a small SUV. Considered just about every SUV on the market including Ford Escape and Nissan Murano. The CX-7 consistently turns my head and for the price you absolutely can not go wrong!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty yet comfortable feel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been a loyal Honda customer for 6 years and had the intention of purchasing a Honda CR-V. The Mazda CX-7 is so much fun to drive, has more room than the CR-V, and is very sleek. The handling is awesome and is just a fantastic car for our growing family, including pets. LOVE this car! When push came to shove, Honda wouldn't come close on the price OR the financing. I think I have been converted to a Mazda driver and may not ever go back to Honda. Everyone who has ridden in this car says it rides like a feather, especially in the back seat. It has a huge space in the rear and is just an all-around great car that is so much fun to drive! The Mazda CX-7 is my new favorite car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive (Zoom Zoom!) Sleek interior, lots of room all-around (front, back, back storage) Love the look and the feel of driving this car. It gets better than the mileage advertised. We travel quite a bit and are getting about 25/26 miles to a gallon, which is great...comparable to the CR-V. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Only have about 1500 miles on it. Broken in very easily and averaged 23.3 MPG mostly around town. Quality is excellent. I bought the least expensive Sport version, no bells and whistles to speak of. Had the dealer install a Sunroof and it works better than the factory. My suggestion, spend the extra money and get more extras. I drive a lot, 35K yearly, and probably made a mistake with the MPG but I knew what it was when I bought it. It is a blast to drive and has great acceleration around town. Zippy! Vehicle is tight with no squeaks or rattles and nothing has fallen off yet so things are good. I would recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration and quality of construction for a $23K car, not bad. I think the car looks good too and it has a sporty feel when driving. Quite impressed. We aren't talking a BMW here, just a solid, quick steering, inexpensive vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I researched this car for weeks before making my purchase (lease) in January of09. The car is so much fun to drive and is really a good looking vehicle- I have black on black. I have been having weird problems with the car, though. At first I thought it was driver error, but no. Occasionally when I would return to my locked vehicle I noticed the windows were half way down on the front, and the moon roof was partially opened. Once in a while after turning the key off the driver seat would automatically go back. Well, the window thing kept occurring so I took it to the deal and they replaced the main "brain modular". Now it is happening AGAIN!! Unsure on the quality of this vehicle!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the engine, the stereo bose sytem rocks and the car is sleek!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having a fun car to drive is a top priority for me, at the same time I like something practical; cx7 fits the bill perfectly. The power is good and the handling is excellent. It looks, feels and drives sporty. The tech package is great, lots of nice features for the money. My biggest disappointments so far have been the excessive road noise and lack luster Bose stereo. In terms of gas mileage; Mostly city-18MPG and mostly highway- 22MPG. In my shopping I think Rav4 \Forester are the best all around choices; Santa Fe, most refinement and bang for the buck, CX-7, best sporty crossover; poor man?s FX35-X3-RDX.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good power, excellent handling. Keyless entry/ignition. Xenon lights. Sporty interior layout, Blue on red interior light scheme. Stand out styling. Car for the money.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in a 2007 Mazdaspeed6 Grand Touring which I was leasing for an 09 CX-7 Sport. Purchased on a budget and certainly miss all the bells and whistles. However this is a fun car to drive considering what it is. Exterior styling is awesome but the interior is bland. There is considerable torque steer under moderate acceleration. After driving for a few days I wish I had spent the cash and upgraded to the Touring model. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling. Room to haul stuff and still look cool.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After recently owning both Lexus and BMW, I decided to try a Mazda this time. Considering I had a questionable repair history with the fancy nameplates, what's the worst that could happen with Mazda? Well after 1800 miles, nothing. The vehicle is fun to drive, handles well and looks great. Only time will tell of course, but so far I have been impressed with the car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great acceleration and great looking. Handles well, Bose system and Bluetooth are flawless. Comfortable seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought this CX-7 this month. I am very excited about this SUV. Drives and handles great. Has a turbo 4 cylinder that feels like a V-8. Awesome power, especially when you need that extra boost to get on the freeway, or just changing lanes. The interior feels like a glove. Fully loaded was the way it came. Even have seat warmers and power seats. Has excellent sound system stock with mp3 and media connections. I Drove all the competions SUV's that were in it's class, however, this was the best by far for money, performance and style and comfort. Excellent SUV. I am very happy and I got a great deal below invoice!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior and the performance. For an SUV it gets excellent gas milege. I average 25-28 mpg so far. Depends on how often I drive in town. Just a great SUV with power everything. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked up my Grand Touring CX7 three weeks ago. Drives great, performance is very good. The interior could use upgrade, the door panels look cheap. Overall the CX7 is worth the money and is fun to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance from the turbo, no turbo lag that I can feel</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Do not buy a Mazda CX-7 with AWD! Mazda has a serious vibration issue in all the Cx-7 AWD models. From 55 to 100 mph (yes, I tested to 100) the car has a vibration in the AWD system. I tried to get it repaired and they tried for a while and gave up. We found four examples and they all vibrated. They now consider the vibration "normal". They refused to replace mine because "it would not eliminate the problem". I tested almost all the CUVs out there... none vibrate like this! Beware! They are not going to fix this!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stereo, navigation, looks, handling, performance. If you don't get AWD, the car rocks!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought my 2009 CX-7 Grand Touring FWD in Oct 2008, wonderful car so far, great style. The only thing it needs is a complete overhaul on the navigation system-very hard to read. Aside from that I would buy another. I only have 325 miles on it so far, but I was happy with the lease terms. Go and buy this and have fun.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling, ample room.</FAVORITE>
