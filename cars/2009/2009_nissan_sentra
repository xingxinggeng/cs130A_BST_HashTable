<TEXT>Cash for clunkers deal I was due a better vehicle. First new car I have ever bought. I looked at everything small to mid sized out there and I mean everything. I was looking for better mileage. Averaging 30 currently. Most cars were uncomfortable, over priced, cheap quality or no room. I am 6'2" tall and my head hit the roof in half and my legs would have to be held up off of the seat to keep from smashing the gas pedal to the floor in the rest. Not in the Senta. Plenty of leg room, a whole hands with above my head. For you taller people, this one is it. It is very deceiving from the outside. Roomy, comfortable, solid car. Can't say enough good about it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Price. Leg and head room, handling, smooth running 4 cylinder. Lots of pep. Loads of great extra features you would expect in a higher priced vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this car with the idea to save money in the future to counter possible rising gas prices, and I was surprised at the design and overall quality. The CVT tranny is a little weird at first, but it's a great performer. Some may say it's boring, but if you just want to drive and not worry about shifting or rpm's then this is the one. Torque right off the bat is good, you can feel it in the seats, once car is at the speed you want, rpm goes down low, and it's quiet, surprisingly quiet on the freeway for a small car. Small on the outside, roomy on the inside. Big trunk, good styling, and fairly wide. It's comfortable enough for my commute, AC kicks butt, a real quality motor, quiet at idle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Strong 2 liter motor, not too hard, comfortable seats, good quality mechanically, good styling, smooth cvt transmission, great MPG I'm getting 30+ combined.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've driven this car for only about 2000 miles. My initial impressions are that I am VERY satisfied. The interior is large for it's class (97.7cuft)and very much appreciated by my growing boys. The car I have has the CVT transmission. It runs very smooth and quiet under low torque applications- a little loud during acceleration. the ride is very quiet. The car has great amenities- good sound system, blue tooth, mp3 cd player w/ aux jack, keyless entry, car computer (mpg, dte, temp, etc). The blue tooth and keyless entry are a little extra, but this was the only car I found with a standard computer. Aluminum rims would of been a nice touch- worth the extra$ if you can find one with it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth, keyless entry are the ritz. Very pleased with the quiet ride and power of car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove Nissan Sentra and just fell in love with it. It handled the curves well and had great pick up and go. I really liked how comfortable the seats were and how smooth the ride was. Having an auxiliary input jack for my MP3, Trip computer with outside temp, distance to empty, and steering wheel mounted audio controls was just extra icing on the cake.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort. Acceleration and smoothness. Steering wheel controls. Fun to drive and stylish. And I love the color I picked (Brick Red)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had A Jeep Grand Cherokee once that was under 36,000 miles and the transmission went out - the freeze Plugs went out and the final straw was when the windows would not go up - that was my turning point to buy a Toyota 4Runner or a Nissan Pathfinder - Thank You Jeep for forcing me to make the Move and Thank You Toyota for being more expensive. This is my 3rd Nissan and I must say my faith in Nissan is as strong as ever - With the added incentive for Cash For Clunkers how could I pass up on trading in a 1986 4x4 Ford Bronco II. To have such a Reliable vehicle again (Nissan) is like a breath of Fresh Air.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smart Key - You'll Love it - get it / CVT makes for a very smooth quite ride on those not so bumpy roads</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Midyear model in midnight sky was the car I wanted after reviewing everything I could about the nissan vs.mazda3,honda civic and toyota corolla. Had it two weeks now and very happy about choice. Great price too(rebates from dealer and nissan to dealer in addition to 4500 cars voucher) made it a no brainer. Interior comfort and roominess was best of the group. I am 6'2" and interior size was important. Great acceleration and smooth,seamless transmission, Handling is pretty good and quiet for a small car. The only negative comments I can make is the oddly shaped rearview mirrors and security alarm going off when unlocking trunk without unlocking doors first. Otherwise s solid choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car! I had a sunroof put in and it works and looks awesome. This is fun to drive. I love how it tells me how many miles I can go before empty. I test drove a toyota corolla before I drove this, it doesn't compare to the Nissan Sentra. Very smooth ride for a small car. Inside is just ride not too close to the passenger and roomy. I like how it auto locks when you go past 15 mph. Very easy to park and back up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>These current Sentra models are mid The new Sentras rock!. CVT is real smooth and have not had any problems with what some call "rubberband effect" (have not experienced it on this car yet!). Before deciding for this car i drove the Mazdas 3 & 5, Toyota Yaris & Camry, a VW and the Nissan Versa but ultimately decided for this car because it's good mileage, driveability and specially comfort... the lines looks somewhat similar to a Lexus.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering wheel controls Nice acceleration & cruising Good handling Trunk space with the fold flat 60/40 rear seats Excellent leg and head space for the passengers Supberb road visibility </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Sentra! We looked at all of the competitors (Corolla, Elantra, Focus) and I found the Sentra to be the nicest and most comfortable. I love that it has the features of more expensive cars (leather, bluetooth, xm, etc), but it was less than $20000. It's fun to drive and great for in town and long trips. And the gas mileage is good too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had the car for about a month and found it easy and fun to drive. It's just about the right size for both a daily commute and for longer highway trips. Driver's seat provides good support and the driving position provides for a commanding view of the highway. Please disregard any negative comments you may have read about the interior - it is a classic industrial design. Just look up industrial design or Raymond Loewy for more info on this design style. Mostly city around town driving averages about 29- 30 MPG </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering feel, driving position, dash layout.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my new sentra even though I bought it today. I got the base model; I love the car overall forget about the Edmunds rating at 7.1 I'll give it a 10! Interior is easy to use comfortable love the auxiliary input jack, although a little bit pricier than its competition its still worth it. Has a lot of power to be a 2.0liter 4 cylinder I love velocity &its really fast & ideal for daily commute. Its also fun to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortness, good looking style, auxiliary input jack.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a good car and there are good cash back recession incentives. But here is why I think consumer reports lists owners to be less than satisfied. When switching vent from defrost to vent or floor, the A/C automatically activates. This cannot be deprogramed to function like a normal car. Routinely end up driving with A/C on in the winter. I'll adapt, but it's frustrating. Back seat seat belt connector very rigid, difficult for kids to buckle w/ booster seat. Not great maneuverability in parking lots. Fuel mileage in city is much less than estimated - highway is good.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Spacious comfortable quite ride. Good price.</FAVORITE>
