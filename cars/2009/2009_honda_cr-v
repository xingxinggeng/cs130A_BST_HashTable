<TEXT>I just got this car a few weeks ago and I am in love. I don't know why it gets low reviews on its exterior - that's the part that attracted me to it the most. I didn't like how it looked prior to 2007, but since its remodeling the Honda CR-V is by far a lot better looking than the Rav4 and Rogue if you ask me. I love the sleek, aerodynamic exterior - beautiful. The inside is comfortable (hard seats?? I don't think so.) and I love the nighttime lighting inside. I love the CR-V's reliability and how safe I feel inside. The MPG is great...I've been averaging 22.2 on city roads. Has lots of space and I love the sunroof and tinted back windows. I pretty much am obsessed with my new car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nighttime blue lighting on the dashboard, sunroof, tinted back windows, large cargo area, exterior - especially the front (reminds me of the Lexus SUV), great MPG.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I admired the new CR-V body style for a couple of years before buying one. I did a test drive and mentioned to the salesman that the headrest was uncomfortable. He said not to worry, it was adjustable. After purchasing the vehicle, the dealership did not provide an overview of any of the features -- all they wanted to do was make the sale. I recently drove my CR- V on a 6 hour day trip. By the time I got there, I had a massive headache. I also had a bruise on my left leg because the parking break is placed right where I normally rest my leg. Can you say buyer's remorse? I hate this car. The headrest is not adjustable and the parking break is going to stay where it is. Back to Toyota next time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>In this case the things I dislike overpower anything positive about the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked up my CRV 10 days ago. Have about 650 miles on it, including one trip of 450 miles round trip. I have no real complaints. The vehicle appears to be very well built. The seats are not the best though. I have the leather. They are OK, but I wouldn't really recommend this vehicle for long trips. Maybe mine will get more comfortable as they get broken in. Also the leather has a very plastic look and feel to it. What can you expect, I guess, when you are only paying 26K for a new vehicle fully loaded, especially when that vehicle has AWD. I have been averaging about 19 mpg in suburban driving, and got around 26-27 mpg on my highway trip, and that was mostly around 70-80 mph. Power is fine.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM satellite, build quality appears to be top notch. Under the hood, everything appears jewel-like. You can clearly see what is steel, what is aluminum, and much of the steel actually looks to be polished or chromed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With over 10,000 miles, most cross-country with A.C. blasting, the CRV has averaged 30 mpg highway and 25 city! Love the interior lighting. The headrest is a bit uncomfortable on long drives, and for me, there is a "blind side" in the right rear. The steering wheel has a nice form, and I have grown to love the stereo's volume control located on it. The car has a tight seal and I feel safe it it. Wish there were some console and not just fold down...seems a bit of a waste of space. A.C. and heater work quickly. Handles well in the rain and has small turning radius. In cruise control, up hills, it doesn't skip a beat! Test drove Subaru, Saturn, Toyota, and Volvo (+$20,000!). Loved the CRV!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Night interior lighting. Safety. Easy handling. Spacious and quiet. Love the trip odometer display with mpg info and oil life info. Great gas mileage. Back door opens with ease from outside. I don't mind waiting at long lights if I am in this car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my Dodge Caravan that I had for 17 years for the Honda CR-V. The ac works intermittently and I took it back within the first week and it was not fixed. I had to take it back and the clutch, temp sensor and thermal protector were replaced and it still had the problem after being 3 days in the shop. Now I took it back and the dealership is troubleshooting. It is day 3. I contacted Honda Corporate- disappointed- one more layer of mgmt. I am looking into the lemon law process. I have had the vehicle for less than 2 months and less than 300 miles and it has been in the shop 3 times already. I would suggest that before buying test the SUV and ac sufficiently.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The CRV is a 4-cyl but handles like a 6-cyl. Easy steering and smooth acceleration. I am happy overall with the SUV except for ac.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just picked this car up tonight and already am in love. I just came off a lease of a Nissan Murano (2006), and while I enjoyed the Murano, I love my Honda. This is the first Honda I have owned. I did plenty of research before leasing this SUV. I looked at the Rav 4, Rogue, Escape, etc. The reviews on the CR-V blew the competition out of the water. I read all of the previous reviews, and again, just picked it up 4 hours ago, so at this point I have no complaints about anything. Looking forward to 36 months of BLISS in this car. LOVE IT!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Decided to purchase my first Honda and wanted something more than a car but not as much as a SUV. I test drove the CRV first and that is all it took. It has more room on the inside than one would think by looking at it from the outside. My kids and husband all love it and I call it the ultimate grocery getter...plenty of room for everything. I love the ride and the fuel mileage is average 26 mpg. Love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I live and drive in San Francisco. Our streets are not the best. We have lots of hills, stop signs, and untimed traffic lights. I guess none of this is taken into account when "they" calculate the city mpg. With about 80% city and 20% highway driving, I'm getting, with a very light foot, about 17 mpg. The turning radius is a bit too much for easy U-type-turns. The rear window is too high for easy backing into my downhill garage. Road noise at freeway speed is a bit too loud. I expected better. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride is firm, pothole control is excellent, braking is outstanding. Wheel response is outstanding. Forward visibility is outstanding. Engine noise is very low and accelerates like a V-6. I'm a very happy camper.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did a lot of research on similar cars from various manufactures along with the CRV, before opting for the CRV. It is primarily driven by my wife (who loves it to bits). She drives 120miles round trip to work every day and says the drives it great. It has lots of room in the front and back. Regarding the fuel consumption, well she is averaging around 29miles/gal. We did a round trip on Labor day from Chicago to Cincinnati to Twinsbury and back to Chicago. An amazing car. I loved the drive as a driver and a passenger (in the front and back). Both my son and daughter love the drive and the comfort the CRV has to offer. There was lots of room in the trunk for all our legs. Well designed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>What can I say "COMFORT" all round, front and back. Excellent drive. Super fuel consumption. Ideal for a large family.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have driven this CRV for about 1,000 miles and taken a few trips. This design is very refined with road and wind noise very well controlled. The engine is very smooth and quiet. The typical 4 cyl rev can be heard when accelerating, but is not intrusive or loud. It has very responsive handling and power. While we have yet to do one of those "pedal to the metal" passes, the engine does allow very good pick-up with surprising torque. In comparison to the 2010 Forester, Rav4, and Venza, only the Venza beat it in ride refinement and quiet. However its 2.6 was slightly sluggish with the larger vehicle. The CRV feels more like a midsize in the passenger area than a compact.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After much research, and trying to make a decision between the RAV4 and the Honda, I chose to go with the Honda and absolutely have no regrets. I am a 6'4" male, and this vehicle is a perfect fit for me. I traded in a Toyota Matrix. After some pretty severe Midwest winters, I knew I wanted to get back into an SUV. (I had a Mountaineer before the Matrix). This is one of the best handling vehicles that I have ever owned. For continuous winter driving in town I am getting 18-19 miles per gallon. I had several colors to choose from, and I opted for the Urban Titanium Metallic. This color hides the dirt better than some of the darker colors. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the way the hatch opens as opposed to the RAV4. The CD system is fabulous. I think the instrument panel has a nice lighting effect. Overall the vehicle seems like a very well built vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm a Toyota person having owned and loved my Highlander and other Toyotas over the years, but I wanted a smaller SUV. The Rav4 has a bit better "fit and finish" and lots to like, but I did not want the rear door that opens like a car door nor the tire there. The AWD CR-V handles very well in snow, and the 4 cyl engine performs well enough for me. The CRV is the perfect size for me. It looks beautiful to me and gives a panoramic view of the road like other SUVs. It's safety record is tops.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>rear door, superior radio/CD player, heated front seats, large alloy wheels, center console, power driver seat with lumbar support, leather, cargo tray (extra), dual deck cargo shelf, ABS, tire-pressure monitoring system (saved me already), heated exterior mirrors; excellent included package; price</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It has been an adjustment for me after driving a minivan for 12 years. Needed some cargo room for hockey equipment but did not want to drive a minivan anymore. This vehicle fills the need. Interior room is terrific considering the size of the vehicle. Handles very well in all kinds of weather and snow. Comfortable front and back seats and nice ride for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In my first review, I stated that my first tank of fuel netted 20 mpg in the city. Further driving of all types now reveals that city driving is 23-24 mpg and interstate driving at 70 mph and below is at 28.8 mpg. This is terrific and I could not be more pleased with this car. It is outstanding in every area. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The feel of the car on the road at 70mph is secure, safe, and smooth. Little road noise. Superb leather seats with great back support. XM radio is outstanding quality. The exterior design is beautiful and the interior is functional and handsome. What a GREAT automobile.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Firstly I'm pretty picky and I haven't had the car long. The driver's seat could use better lumbar support and a bit more leg room. Cloth seat durability is ? + meant for smaller person. Backup sensor add-on although nice isn't something really needed. Its not hard to get used to backing it up. Cheap carpet floor mats are not going to last long. Rear door doesn't latch w/o slamming. Addon compass/rear view mirror sits too high on window. Too close to top console (no clearance). Wind impacts mileage a LOT. Very limited range (350ish and much less in wind). Bit rough shifting out of 1st sometimes. Braking is great. Handles well. Good visibility. For its size, I like the car. Hard to beat new.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The red is a great color. Looks ok with light dirt. Car has good pep for a 4 cyl. Easily good enough for getting onto+for hwy. The front seat will lay flat. It would need seat protection I think it would allow 2x4's to be carried. Has good cargo space and even with my whining, it is comfortable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>CR-V is Alabaster Silver with gray leather. The ride is very quiet and much better then my 2008 Honda Accord EX-L which I traded in. My wife loves the seats and the vehicle tracks beautifully on the interstate. The first tank of gas only local driving was an acceptable 20 mpg.The XM sound system is better than before. Transmission is smooth and quiet. We love this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system, quiet engine, no road noise and smooth ride. You just have to experience the ride to understand my comments. Seats are supportive and of high quality leather. We purchased no options - you don't need them.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently purchased my CRV in Nov 2008 to replace an aging Nissan Frontier. While the vehicle drives well and gets great fuel economy (about 25 mpg), there are some minor things that bother me. The seats are very stiff and get to be uncomfortable on long drives, the dash slants away from the driver, so you have to lean forward to get to the the controls (radio, HVAC, etc) and the external mirrors are too small. They LX model has a foldable tray, for about $10 in material they could have put in a full center console as well. Other than those minor issues, this is a great vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned several Accords both 4 and 6 cyl. Always great performers but I now need AWD (Colorado mountains/plains) and storage room. 27/32 HWY and 22/24 urban - REALLY. Very impressed w/power and trans. in mountain and normal terrain. Big guy, it is comfortable and stability is outstanding; w/performance in windy conditions surprisingly good. Have not had any snow to test in yet. Compared with Forester (lousy 4 spd trans.) almost went w/it anyway, Rav4 (not as stable and the swing out rear door is dangerous) and Edge (lousy mpg but felt substantial). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Generally: size/functionality, solid quality, styling, room and visibility. Specifically: transmission (smooth with an outstanding power curve for a 4 cyl., MPG better than sticker - really. Interior controls are very functional and accessible.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I carefully considered the Forrester, the RDX, and the Jetta TDI wagon. I came to my senses and committed to the CRV and I'm loving it. The reviews mention a slow 0-60. I haven't noticed much lag in city traffic. The 0-35 I have to do almost every other block around town is zippy. I love the look of the redesigned CRV. They borrowed from the best. The sculpted hood, the curves and points of the headlights...very appealing. Tail-lights were transitioned from an earlier model which evoke the design of certain Volvos. Mileage is around 23 mixed. Hint: go with good gas. I noticed a remarkable drop in engine noise when I didn't skimp and that V-Tec 4 went butter soft, in a good way.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the aesthetics of the exterior design (the hood spoiler accessory makes it a frugal cousin of the X3), the utility of the interior design, nice stereo, excellent air-flow for climate control, low engine noise (w/good gas), and a black plastic composite bumper for parallel parking in the city.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought my 2009 Honda CRV LE (base model) two weeks ago. I got the glacier blue color with gray interior. Its a beautiful car w/ exquisite design. The interior is spacious (high ceiling) and adjustable high seating offer panoramic view. Good trunk size to haul groceries & furniture. Its a fun & sporty looking car. Handling can be a bit stiff and the engine drags when you try to accelerate (but then again it is a 4 cylinders). The following need improvements: 1. Lack power when you try to accelerate, make all trims V6. 2. Trunk door should release/pop automatically w/ press of button. 3. Add alarm to all trims. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1. High seating offers panoramic view, exquisite exterior design. 2. Trunk door opens upward instead of side. 3. Spare tire store inside the trunk and not dangling on the back. 4. Great CD player.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having owned it for a month and 1600 miles, I am delighted with my new CRV. I traded in a Forester which was only 2 years old and I am pleased with the performance and comfort of the CRV. Plenty of power for commuting and super comfortable on the road. Very quiet and smooth ride (unlike Forester). Seats are so comfortable. Plenty of room for 4 adults too. Love the XM radio. I am getting 25 mpg in mixed driving and over 27 in all hwy driving which is what the Subaru got. Only complaints are rear visibility is a bit limited but not terrible, and the heat is slow to warm up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have driven 1600 miles. Added Remote start and Back-up sensors at the dealer. Two things really bother me. I am getting no better gas mileage with this 4 cyl on the highway than the 3.9 6 cyl Impala I turned in. The other thing is the Remote start. Why would you have to turn off the engine before you can open the door and get in. You have to restart the car. Double work for the battery and starter. On the GM vehicle you just enter the car and insert the key and drive away. Come on Honda, if GM can do it, so can you. If they can correct this and add a 6 cyl like the Rav-4, I think I would be close to a perfect vehicle in this class.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new Honda CRV!! It is so fun to drive, easy to operate, and very kid friendly. I am getting 21-22 mpg (mostly city driving) but I've only owned the car for 3 weeks. Hopefully, that will improve a little as time goes on. I just added two accessories, the roof rack and the moon roof visor which really added to the overall appearance of the car. I traded in a Pontiac G-6 for my CRV. All of my groceries fit into this car - all $350.00 worth! I test drove a Pontiac Torrent, and a Rav4 before the Honda. I definitely made the right choice. Love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the steering - very zippy! It reminds me of my husband's old Honda Prelude. I still hear about how "I never should have traded that car in!" Also love the back lift-up hatch as opposed to the Rav4's back end door that opens to traffic and not the sidewalk.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We liked the car when we first bought it, and our satisfaction has only improved. We bought the CR-V because we thought it was really functional given our lifestyle (baby and two dogs). It was one of the few small suvs that could comfortably fit our car seat behind the front passenger seat. That, combined with Honda's rep for reliability and safety, sealed the deal. We've driven it for 2 weeks now and really enjoy the ride. The only negatives are that the sight lines to the rear aren't ideal (but they are more than acceptable). Also, the seats aren't the most comfortable/luxurious, but neither are they uncomfortable. We got the LX trim level, however, so that's to be expected.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am in love with my Honda purchased 2 weeks ago. I feel like I'm driving a luxury vehicle compared to the 1999 Rav 4 which I traded in. Sweetheart of a ride. I feel safe and secure - it's a sound vehicle, comfortable, quiet, plenty of energy for a 4 cylinder, easy steering, decent radio, love the adjustable height in driver's seat, plus adjustable steering wheel. My first time with tinted windows - they're fantastic - no bright headlights from rear cars annoying me anymore - the window tint completely takes care of that!

<TEXT>After test-driving everything in the segment, I found the CRV to be the best choice for me. Very comfortable ride, lots of functionality and interior room. Good fuel economy, about 30 highway and 23 in town. Plenty of pep in town, gets right up to speed on the highway. It is very similar to the Rav4 and the current Forester.

<TEXT>I was extremely hesitant about purchasing a 4 cylinder, but after 2 weeks of ownership in hilly country, there has been no problem with power. It cruises comfortably, the seats are fabulous, and there is definitely enough power to pass a car when necessary. The car is sporty and fun to drive, easy to turn, and easy to convert for large items (I brought a huge self-propelled lawnmower home in the back of the car last week). My mileage is averaging 24.5 mpg. The car is quiet and the radio/CD sounds terrific. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a 2006 Chevy Equinox and I traded up for this vehicle. I definitely traded up! The Chevy's interior left a lot to be desired and after a while I grew tired of the exterior as well. With my new CR-V I feel like I'm definitely driving in style. My main goal was to increase my mpg average without sacrificing space and comfort. I have a very large dog and thought a car might get better mileage, she would not have her own space. With the CR-V I get car style mileage and SUV style space. The perfect combination. If you're looking for that combination as well as great interior and exterior style and finish, then you've found the one to get. I've had it for two weeks now and have ZERO regrets.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We test drove a lot of SUV's-a lot. The sticker shock was, well, shocking. With this Honda, though too small to classify as an SUV, was exactly what we were looking for. The interior quality really sets it apart and was not seen anywhere in this price range. It is very roomy, drives exceptionally well, is quite nimble and gets good gas mileage. However, it is woefully underpowered. This "car/suv" is a great alternative to spending mid forties on another vehicle. And what's really nice, in five years this Honda will have the same trade in value as that 45K SUV we liked and almost bought. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Not pleased with overall ride. Gas mileage excellent. Went on a 300 mile highway trip and crv was very bumpy, felt almost every bump on highway. Could hear the tires going over every bump inside the car. Outside noise extremely loud inside crv. Needs more insulation to eliminate noise. Headrest very uncomfortable. Other than that crv is ok. Will wait and see how brakes hold up. Other reviews complain about possible brake pads and rotor replacements sooner than most cars. Would not recommend this crv. Unfortunately daughter bought same car and she also experiences same loud noises.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm really enjoying the CRV. I've owned Toyotas for my last 5 vehicles and may become a long-term Honda fan. This is a well designed and built vehicle. The total package was the selling point: moonroof, stereo, privacy glass, alloys, fit and finish. These were only available in the high end Outback. I go on my first road trip tomorrow and am anxious to see what the gas mileage is. Highly recommend!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, stereo, moonroof. Rav4 steering is electric and feels unnatural. CRV has great steering feedback. There is enough power for conservative driving. Made in Ohio!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I compared the Nissan Rogue and RAV4 to the CR-V. For the price, I felt the EX 4WD trim offered the best value compared to the competition. It handles like a much smaller vehicle. Coming from a Nissan Versa, it often feels more nimble and easier to maneuver. The Rogue was a little more responsive once rolling, but the CR-V feels more responsive off the line.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent steering feel and response. Steering weighted just right!!! Nice interior materials, Well shaped seat, great visibility sitting high without any large blind spots, and very stable feeling on higher speed turns like on ramps. The suspension really follows the bumps in the road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am a new father and traded in my Civic Coupe for a family-friendly, but fun-to-drive CR-V. On a recent trip to Albany, NY to Riverside, NJ (250 miles) I averaged 31 MPG--not too bad for a car that is a lot heavier than my 35MPG Civic. This car is great for the guy who is in his early 30's, just starting a family, and who can't see himself in a minivan or a Sedan like the Accord or Camry (too old manish and boring). I have plenty of room for all my daughter's stuff and enough left over for my passengers--even with a car seat installed. Overall, this is a great compromise between style and fun, and necessity and practicality. The CR-V guarantees I will be a Loyal Honda Owner forever!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cruise Control is Standard--great for fuel economy. Huge trunk. Safety, Safety, Safety! It's not a minivan!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have written a previous review about this vehicle. This has to be one of the most uncomfortable vehicles I have owned. So bad that I traded in a 8 month old 2009 CRV with 12,150 miles for a Mercury Mariner. Dealer said I was the first to trade this vehicle in because there was no data on 2009 trades. My biggest complaint on this car is that they seats are like rocks. I drive 60+ miles per day and bought it for the gas mileage. I was averaging 25.3 mpg, but I was driving a 2001 Nissan Frontier with 162,000 miles more than I was driving this vehicle. I simply hated driving this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased a CR-V LX AWD in January and have been so pleased with it that we just purchased an additional one today. Price was right - $21,100 for an LX AWD plus tax and title. We have about 4,000 miles on our other CR-V and still have 60% of our oil life remaining. The CR-V was easy to drive in the winter and we didn't have any trouble with driving in the snow.</TEXT>

<TEXT> We recently drove from Minnesota to Maine via Canada, down the East Coast and back to the Midwest with our two kids. Most of what you hear about the CRV is true. There is pronounced road noise on rough pavement, though smooth pavement is fine. The engine has pep in city driving, but acceleration can be sluggish and the engine can feel over-matched on highway merging and some hills - passing is fine. The suspension and seats are a bit stiff, the low-beam lights are poor, but the driver's view, cabin lay-out, and the responsiveness of the steering are excellent. Easily fit a month's worth of gear. Biggest surprise? Very good mileage 28 - 32 at 70+ on the highway. Not a luxury vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth transmission, cabin lay-out, responsive steering and room. Pleasantly surprised with fuel efficiency thus far on the highway. I am careful, but not slow, and it's been much better than advertised.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I never knew what they mean by fun to drive until I drove my new 2009 CRV EX AWD in Green Tea! I also own a Civic, while a great car with great mileage, it's getting to be too small to be convenient for my family and my dog. Being the first SUV, I was afraid it might be too big to get use to if I switch, but I was surprised to find that CRV drives not much different than my Civic, except much roomier, plenty of space for your legs, head, arms and stuff! Front console is great with useful displays, and the design is very sharp and attractive. Now I look forward drive/riding in my new CRV in the morning to work. Oh I am still trying to improve the mileage by using cruise control. It's decent.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this vehicle on June 30,09. Handles very nicely and the leather seats are quite comfortable. Can't give you city mpg because we live in the country but drove from Illinois to Ohio and got 29.8 mpg doing 65-75mph. I'm 6'1" and there is plenty of headroom. At highway speed over certain types of pavement the road noise into the CRV is VERY loud, especially grooved pavement that is on most overpasses. Also, the smallest of cracks in the pavement are felt when driving over them. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought my 2009 Honda CRV LX 2X and got very annoyed by the driver's seat head support. It is absolutely unacceptable design. Only one hour drive already made my neck uncomfortable.It is like a bullet sitting against the back of your head! forcing your head to bent.The engine is very smooth in local but luggish and noisy on uphills.Accept these two, everything else is almost perfect.But these will cause me to sell it right away.especially the seat.The power is known to be not very good on uphills.But the front seats are not acceptable.pay good attention to it before you buy it. I regret not going to test drive the RAV4.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had SUV'S now for 20 yrs and last year, because of the gas spike, I traded for a Honda Accord...Beautiful car, but was not good in the snow...I kept checking out the Honda CRV's and finally traded last week...This car is ME! Love it even more than my Toyota Highlander, which was a 6 cylinder engine...I was apprehensive at first, because it was a 4cyl, but I see very little difference between the Highlander and my CRV...This car is a keeper, especially with the long New England winters...I really feel safe too, which was one of the determining factors, other than 4 wheel drive...Ok, maybe a nicer rearview mirror and a pop up trunk switch, a bigger fuel tank, but I'm not complaining!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving every small ute out there, I narrowed it down to the CR-V and the Forester. The wife preferred the look of the CR-V over the Forester. Since it's primarily her car we went with the CR-V. I was most concerned about the lack of power (I drive an '09 Murano). However, it packs plenty of punch for her daily needs. It's amazing how spacious the interior feels on such a small frame. This is a perfect vehicle for driving around town, but I prefer the smooth ride of my Murano on a long drive. The handling is superb for an SUV, which makes it fun to drive. I was concerned about rear visibility w/o the backup camera, but it's fine. Make sure you check out the Forester too. </TEXT>

It really is a great value compact SUV for the money, not to mention the Honda reliability. This is our 3rd Honda and we couldn't be more pleased.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well I was sold on all the hype of reliability. My wife is really upset we traded a Chevy that has zero issues to one that has us at the Honda Dealer every week. All little stuff from rattles to AC not working. Oh yeah my second transmission in 18000 Miles. Did I get a lemon? Don't think so, lots of others in the waiting room at Honda thinking what did I do. Oh the new body style will be better; seems they are doing a redesign to modernize it like the Nissan, Chevy , Ford and Mitsubishi.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Upgraded from an 02 CRV EX to an 09 CRV EX. The 09 "seems" smaller in the cargo area - but upon putting the cargo tray from the 02 into the 09 - it's actually the same size. The difference is that the 09 has support shelves for the cargo shelf that stick out into the trunk area. The hatch also slopes - so you lose some space. In addition, the EX is missing the hooks that the 02 had (to hang grocery bags). The 09 is missing dash storage - but the dash is much better designed - I can reach the radio controls without leaning forward. Note - the Honda supplied floor mats are junk! After 1500 miles, I've worn out the carpet pile. The mats on my 02 looked brand new after 7 years. Overall, B+.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dash layout, real time MPG readout (helps you adjust your driving habits to maximize fuel economy). MPG is better than my 02 - averaging around 23/24 with a mix of city/hwy. City driving - 21 MPG.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It was tough, but I was ready to say goodbye to the modified MINI Cooper S that's been my pride and joy since 2002. We've owned other Hondas and every one has been bullet proof. We chose another Honda because of our positive experiences with our local dealer and service department and because our Civic and previous Accord have never required any service other than routine maintenance (affordable even after the warranty has expired). I'm really enjoying the quiet smooth ride that the CR-V provides. I got black w/ ivory interior, looks sharp.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, fit & finish. Feels very well put together. Voice navigation w/climate control. Rear view camera is surprisingly effective/useful, even though window visibility is fantastic.

<TEXT>We have four Hondas (one an 08 CRV) in the family, so sold on reliability. It came down between the CRV and Hyundai Santa Fe. I really liked the Santa Fe for the money, but I drive cars 10-15 years, and felt better about Honda's long term reliability. I have not noticed the road noise problem I have read about. The CRV is fun to drive, and does very well on the interstate. I like the maintenance minder, mpg display, etc. The ride and seats are a little firmer than I like (67 yrs old), but not that uncomfortable. My only problem was "rail rust" in the paint on top. I used a clay bar to help remove it. I do not understand why the top can't be covered in transit. So far, very satisfied.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Considering it is a small SUV, I like the way it handles on the interstate. The four cylinder is smooth and has enough power for my driving. I like the maintenance minder and associated displays. The seating space is good in both front and back, with some rear cargo space still left .</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Before buying the 09 CRV, I owned a 2000 CRV EX-L, a 1996 Honda EX, and a 1990 Civic (Honda owner for 19 years). I really loved those cars, but not this one. It averages about 18mpg (inc. hwy), the temperature controls have to be reset each time, I wish it had an analog dashboard, and there is a serious hesitation right before acceleration. The mirrors are skewed in some way which makes it difficult to park--I have no problem like this in any other car. The steering is a bit stiff, and I've developed tendinitis from gripping it, and the ride is bumpy like it has sports suspension. The floor of the cargo area is flimsy cardboard. Am thinking of trading it in for a Forester or RAV4. Sigh.</TEXT>

I like that the center folds down and becomes a walk through. I also like that with the stick on the dash and parking brake by the pedals, you have floor space up front and can even switch seats up front if you had to, without getting out. I read that some people complain about noise, I have not noticed any so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2007 BMW 328i Sedan for this CRV because I realized the Bimmer wasn't meeting my needs. I have absolutely no regrets in switching to the CRV - the interior is nicer, much more comfortable, the ride is much smoother, the stereo is better, driving position is amazing (I am tall and have a stiff back), and it's great for flopping the seats down and throwing things in. I thought the BMW was my dream car but I now realize the CRV is it. I live in the Bay Area and have 2WD - my mileage is equal to the BMW and the Honda uses regular gas! I average about 22-23 but get 30 on straight highway. Great car for the city, country, single people and families.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When the time came to dump my Civic, I had Rav4 and CRV in mind. Edmunds and others all give Rav4 higher marks, but I found Rav4's small steering wheel very discomforting and the dashboard controls were not that intuitive. Test drove CRV and felt right at home and in fact was more zippier. Rav4 is more powerful, quieter, roomier, fuel efficient and my brains were for it, but my heart went for CRV and still happier after two weeks. Of course CRV looks better too and is exciting to get into CRV and take it for a spin.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the 2009 CRV EX just a week ago. I had a 2004 Xterra (which got, at best, 17 mpg's highway). I figured instead of spending $400/mo in gas this summer, I needed something more practical, but did not want to compromise on size. The CRV is just as big inside, if not bigger, than the Xterra. Although it appears much smaller on the outside? Love the digital display...it has current mpg's, average mpg's (on that tank), tire pressure monitor, and the Maintenance Meter (reminds you to get your oil changed, etc). Does not have a center 'console.' Instead it's a drop-down walk-through (like a minivan would have). The 2.4L 4-banger really has some pep comparable to my old V6.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MPG's, for sure...averaging 25.8 mpg's (about 50/50 town/highway) on the first tank!! Handling is great. 8 cup holders...awesome.

<TEXT>Have had the CRV for 1 month. Couldn't be happier. Always owned Hondas and know their reliability and resale value. The biggest adjustment was going from my 2006 civic 30mph to 22 mph. I know I'll be happy this winter with the AWD. A little surprised a 4 cyl doesn't get better mileage but the confidence and satisfaction with Honda compensates nicely. Bottom line is you get what you pay for and the value of what you get is great. The Hyundai's and Kia's boast a lower price and EXTREMELY limited 100,000 mi. warranty. But my brother in law is a Mercedes specialist and says he doesn't get many Hondas but the Koreans come in frequently and have bad corrosion problems down the road.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. I went from my Acura Integra to this and was not intimated. I've not had to get used to driving it because it practically drives itself. The view is great and everything is easy to reach. The alignment needs to be adjusted and will do that tomorrow. It pulls to the right on some roads within 3 seconds on others it drifts within 6 seconds it's in the other lane. I'm getting 25.7 an 25.8 MPG which is right around what I was getting with my 15 year old 1994 Integra. They are highway miles though with some morning commute (bumper to bumper). Of course I take it easy when I drive. No gunning like a bat out of hell. It's a great car. I expect to keep it for 15 years like my Acura.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first Honda, in fact our first car other then one from the "big 3". The CR-V is a real pleasure to drive. It replaced a 94 Jeep Grand Cherokee with 170K miles. As of now the MPG's are at 22 but this is only local driving. The voice recognition system needs some improvement. It rarely gets the command right the 1st time. I'm surprised at the amount of road noise inside & this might be a factor with the voice commands. We also have a new 09 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 2dr. The Jeep is much quieter & has less road noise at 60MPH. We usually keep a vehicle for 15 yrs or more so I hope it'll last. My wife drives the CR-V 90% of the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When shopping around for a new crossover vehicle, I also considered Toyota RAV4 & Hyundai Santa Fe. RAV4 was too small, leather seats were uncomfortable, interior was disappointing - cheap looking - tire cover on back is ugly. Santa Fe priced right, roomy, comfortable; however didn't like "fake wood" on dashboard and doors. Made interior look old fashioned. CR-V EXL 4 door AWD came standard with leather package including moon roof, rear storage cover, floor mats & other extras were all included in price, not add-ins like the RAV4.

<TEXT>This CR-V (2009) is the greatest car ever. Thinking of a small SUV? Be sure to test drive the CR-V!! I can't believe people have complained of road noise-this auto is so quiet! Handling is immediate and sure-footed. Acceleration is superb. Interior design is great - all controls are clearly marked and easily reached by the driver and front seat passenger. Don't forget! Give a CR-V a test drive.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>its ok</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>So I have about 8k miles on this cr-v. It is ok so far but is begging for improvement. First off the gas mileage is no where near advertised unless you are going to drive pure interstate which I rarely do. My driving is 65% highway (at 65mph-70mpg) and I've been averaging 20 mpg. I did drive this car pure city before and got approx 18mpg. Next is the engine. Do not even think about passing someone with this SUV. The engine is very underpowered, it's almost like this car is begging for a v6. However, the engine is very smooth, and very quiet below 75mph. Ride wise this is a firm ride, Honda could have made the suspension a little softer. Finally THE ROAD NOISE! On the Highway it is very loud. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my CRV for about a week and have put on about 600 miles. The fuel economy stinks for a 4 cylinder! I am averaging just around 20 MPG. The average meter moves up very slowly on the freeways and I seemed to max out at 21 MPG. However, it plummets rapidly when driving in the city getting around 15MPG. This is a lot worse than the 2008 Equinox that I was driving and it was a V6 with a lot more power and interior room. The other reviews are correct about the limited storage option in the CRV. Honda really needs to put in a coin holder. The three slots that are at knee level are small and difficult to access. Actually, they are kind of useless. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall excellent vehicle. Honda attention to design and reliability is well-known. My only concern with a design flaw is in regard to the optional roof rack (see my note below for suggested improvement). MPG tends to vary from manufacturer ratings. Inner city = 14-15 mpg; suburban city = 20-21 (rated at 20); highway = 30-33 (rated at 27). I was pleasantly surprised with a maximum of 33 MPG highway (60-65 mph) for Interstate driving; I recommend the high-end EX-L w/ Navigation, as well as optional fog lamps, mud flaps, all-weather & cargo mats; body-side molding; & Remote starter. Avoid the base model, as it won't hold resale value - opt for the EX with leather and/or navigation.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wife wrecked her 03 PT Cruiser in January, so we car shopped 3 yrs sooner than planned. After research between a Toyota Rav4 & Honda CR-V. Test drove both, especially at night for low beam headlamps in deer country. Both tested well but felt the Honda was a bit better in comfort & mileage and details for the money. Several customers said the service at this dealership was great. We have been getting 24.8 in the commute/town driving and the one road trip of 360 miles I got 29.8 doing around 70. We loved the Cruiser, but already like this one better. It is roomy and well built and has all the appointments needed. Arm rests & visors could be wider, but that's all we see needed after 3 mo. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great mileage, comfort of ride, visibility, feel sturdy, and standard features seem to be a bit more than on most vehicles. Like the rubber tray in the rear compartment for catching spills. We are over 60 and getting in and out is real easy, and lots of cargo room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove most similar sized models so that I could have my own comparison information. I chose the CRV because of the value for my dollar. I have been thrilled with the performance so far (6 weeks). I live in outer suburbs, so gas mileage was an important factor and so far I am averaging around 21 MPG in town. I have not taken it cross-country but am sure that I will be happy with those results too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our second Honda, having a civic before. The drive & handling is very nice. The CRV is very comfortable. We bought the EXL and are glad we did - added extras are worth the money. We looked at both the CRV & the Rav4 for several weeks before we bought. We know we made the right choice. Everything about this car is quality. We love our CRV -- The engine does the job quite well - it's not a hod rod and we did not purchase this vehicle thinking we could go 0-60 in 4 seconds. It cruises great at 70 on the interstate. I would have bought a six cyl. had they made it, but it's not necessary.</TEXT>

I carry two children booster seats on the outboard sides and a third child that doesn't require a booster in the center. Not a rocket, does not need more power for sensible drivers. First tank yielded 25.5 mpg, subsequent tanks yield 26.1 mpg in 70/30 mix of highway and city. Like the trip computer and maintenance minder system. Surprised to see no coin holder. Center console has a place for CD Changer on the Navigation Model that is not accessible for storage on EX-L model. The LX and EX have the folding tray.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my beloved Infiniti Q45t for this Honda. As much as I resisted, I should have done it sooner to recoup the value loss of the "Q." The EX-L is is a rock star in my opinion. The ride is not bad at all, and I don't have a problem with road noise. The XM radio is a must-have feature and the minute I step in, crank the engine, turn XM on, I become a calm, cool, kitten on the freeway instead of the speed demon I used to be. The cargo area is perfect. If you need larger, you would fare better with a truck. I can't believe how easy, and inexpensive it is to keep up with the scheduled maintenance and oil changes. Goodbye $2000 Infiniti repair bills, hello, again, Honda.</TEXT>

My husband is 6'7, 280 lbs., and is comfortable as driver and passenger. I live in the burbs and when driving the back roads it handles like a dream. It is smooth and sporty. Sound system is great, and the car, holistically, has been well thought out. I don't feel there is excess noise, however slightly bumpy over potholes, but this is an SUV. The backseat is roomy and reclining seats are a nice touch. Love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Given the price, everything is amazing. Honda has a tradition of reliability and value; this is clearly evident in the CR-V. The only problem I have is the fuel mileage. I'm a little confused how the other critics on this page are getting over 20 mpg. I mostly drive in NYC and have never broke the 15.3 mpg average. Maybe when EPA tests out the fuel mileage, they are conducted in very spaced out suburbs? Anyways, I recommend this car to everyone, ranging from that cliche fast and furious 18 year old to the neutered family man. </TEXT>

<TEXT>There is much to recommend the 2009 CRV, including a well-built car with many fancy features for a reasonable price. But after only two months, the horribly uncomfortable driving position - and the neck and shoulder pain I am experiencing - is causing me to sell it back to the dealer. I am 5'7" - and would not recommend this car to anyone my size or smaller. When seated a comfortable distance from the steering wheel (which telescopes only minimally), my knees hit the steering column. In addition, the active restraint headrests are horrendous, and there is nothing to be done about to modify their angle, which pushes the head forward. </TEXT>

The vehicle provides better road visibility as it sits up higher than a sedan, decent mileage, and is flexible enough if we need to transport small stuff (e.g., chairs, boxes, etc.).

<TEXT>We were looking for a car similar to our Mazda Tribute. We had it narrowed down to the Hyundai Sante Fe, Mercury Mariner, and the Honda CRV. We compared the 4 cylinder Mariner to the CRV and there was no comparison. The CRV has quite the pick up for a 4 cylinder and the Mariner was very jerky when accelerating. The CRV also rides closer to the ground which allows you to take corners tighter and not feel like you might tip over. So far we are very happy with our decision.</TEXT>

I'm 6'5" and am very impressed with the interior space - both as a driver and front seat passenger. For a 4cyl w/165hp, this thing is fun to drive. We were looking for an AWD vehicle with ample cargo space and the Honda fit the bill. Compared it to the Ford Flex and Chevy Equinox. The fact that Honda had sharp lease deals played a role, but the overall ratings and reviews for the CR-V put it over the top.
