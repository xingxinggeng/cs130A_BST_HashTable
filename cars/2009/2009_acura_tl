<TEXT>Perfection describes the new tl sh-awd! My wife recently traded in her fully loaded Acadia for a loaded tl. I also owned a Lexus is in the past. We test drove everything out- Lexus, audis, BMW's, infiniti's, then we drove this gem. The tl has an amazing technology package -ipod connection, cd, hdd hard drive, and XM. It even holds pictures uploaded via the usb port. The navi is crystal clear and gigantic -I love to see the live weather. This car is comfortable and a blast to drive. I drove it across the country and enjoyed every minute. The leather is so soft! The 300+ horses blows m3's out of the water and I can still get 25 plus mpg's. Test drive one and you will see.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The technology package -nobody holds a candle -weather, navi screen, hdd, voice recognition, pics, the stereos sound quality! Also, the sh-awd is perfect for all weather driving excitement.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drove a G37x, A4, and 3 series. This car was by far the most technologically advanced car and had the best price. We are thrilled with it. Drives like a dream and the tech package makes the car extremely entertaining. The sound system is incredible. I don't think I have ever heard music sound as good. Very smooth ride, yet feels sporty when you want to push it hard.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I-Pod integration, real time weather, the ELS stereo is incredible. I just want to sit in the car all day and listen to music.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having had great experience with our two other Hondas, we chose the TL over the Accord EXL-V6 for a nicer interior and quieter ride. So far this car has not disappointed, providing a proven drive-train in an upscale fun to drive car. Power and handling are great but the ride is a little stiff. It does absorb potholes better the the Accord and is much quieter. Tech Package is easy to learn (without reading the 2" thick manual) and the sound system is excellent. This car is currently a bargain, costing thousands less than foreign assembled competitors.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hands down the best interior in its class. I love the exterior too. This is one car that won't get lost in the parking lot. I have the pearl white and get compliments all the time. This car handles beautifully, especially around corners. When it comes to how people drive 99.9% of the time, this car wins hands down. If you are instead intent on taking your car through a slalom course, maybe pay the extra $10k for similarly equipped BMW or sacrifice interior luxury and resale value and go for a g37. My 2nd TL and I've been very impressed with how solid these cars are. Never had problems with either.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Supple leather interior. Comfort. The dual cockpit design of the interior oozes luxury. Traffic updates on navi screen. Reverse camera shows footprint of where car will end up. Ipod SYNC. Syncs with my outlook contacts. Too many tech features to list - I'm still learning them.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this car for three months now. I applaud Acura for finally taking the lead with a fresh bold design for the TL. The car?s styling is simply brilliant--- inside and out. The superbly integrated Tech. package brings the car?s substance on par with its stunning looks. For the last 15 years, I?ve only driven German cars. Before buying the TL, I also considered Audi A4, BMW 535x, VW CC VR6, Infiniti G37x, and the Lexus ES350. All things considered, my final analysis led me straight to the TL.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plenty of low-end torque; precise steering; perfectly tuned suspension that offers a taut sporty ride without feeling harsh on rough roads; superbly integrated Tech. package features (hi- res. voice-activated nav. system, 440 watt HDD-based audio sys., HandsFreeLink, and the keyless entry system).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The TL packs a lot of car for the price. You can easily pay 1000s more for a comparably equipped German car. Enjoy all the tech features they packed. For a 1st year car, it feels pretty darn solid with no rattles so far. The ride is sporty but yet still maintains a luxury feel as well. The interior space is more than adequate to seat 5 in comfort. I like the high-tech look of the dash. The exterior style had me at first glance so it just works for me. I could think of improvements but I think I'm being picky at that point. The TL presents a value proposition that can't be beat.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tech package especially the usb input. Build quality. Sound system. Exterior styling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Although the exterior of this styling seems a bit awkward, the first time one of them drive past me on the freeway, I was hooked. It's angular styling is actually quite brilliant. I purchased one for my wife in the pearl white color and we get nothing but compliments. The ride is pleasant and the engine has plenty of power for entertaining launches onto freeways and long jaunts to LA. In fact, the day after I bought it, I put over 400 miles on it driving to southern California and it was excellent. I also have a loaded Honda Accord, and I'll admit that I used to think Acura TL's were just a dressed-up Accord. But I am a believer now that the Acura is a much nicer car, even in standard trim.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our TL with Technology Package 1 week ago. We continue to be amazed at the performance and the amount of features per dollar. We have received many compliments on the vehicles looks both inside and out. It is roomy enough for the two of us and our 2yr old. She has more leg room in the back then she did in our old vehicle-a Saab 9-7x SUV. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Technology package-navigation, ipod integrations, hard drive, the ability to use a flash drive for music and pictures, voice activated everything, keyless start and entry. Fuel Economy. We are averaging 28 on the hwy with 93 octane. Roominess of the interior. Build quality</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned my Acura for three weeks now. I am a little disappointed, because I had to take it back to the dealer for a problem with the rear passenger door. A sensor is not working properly and causing the alarm go off. Otherwise, this car is a lot fun. The technology is second to none. No other car offers the same package of technology. This car is much smoother and better built than the 2006 model which I had owned for three years. My only regret is not getting the AWD. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The technology package! Live traffic, iPod interface and hard drive to upload all your CDs, weather forecast, which is limited but cool. Key less entry and start!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As soon as you start to initiate a corner the suspension grabs the road feeling even more secure; I don't know how they accomplished this and I wish I had a picture to show you the linkage near the rear tires. There's days I like to slumber home and the new TL coddles you home. Put the gear shifter into sport mode using the paddle shifters and the suspension seems to tighten up (I wonder if it has to do with the transmission either advancing the vehicle or slowing the car down when you let off the accelerator) when you want to race around, nice. Ipod, flash and hard drive integration are easy to use and once you get used to them you wonder how you lived without them.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Second day I was coming home from the gym and threw my bag in the trunk and couldn't close the door, the trunk wouldn't lock and kept popping back open with an audible alert (I thought oh no is it broken), but finally I realized the key fob was in my gym bag, won't let you lock your keys in trunk.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned Hondas in the past and upgraded to the TL. Love the car. Lot of tech w/voice controls, XM radio, etc. Holds the road well, good acceleration and getting 27 mpg on the highway commute with about 600 miles on the car. My only complaint is the seat is very stiff and will probably prove tiring on a long trip.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I compared the RL with the TL and there is no comparison. The TL has a better drive, better gas mileage, more pickup and cost $5,000 less. I was surprised that the two models are about the same size. The AWD is great in the snow. I previously had a BMW 750 and am not disappointed. It takes time to learn how to use all the features. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. Its my 3rd Acura and my favorite by far. I wasn't sure about the rotating wheel on the navigation system at first but now that I have driven it for a few weeks, I have completely changed my mind. No more glare on the screen, it almost looks high def. I looked at other cars (infinity G35, Honda Accord and Nissan Maxima) just to see how it compared and I think I got the best car for my money. Its luxurious in the inside and and the tech package makes a tech freak like me very very happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT> My last three cars now have been Acuras, an 04TL and a 06RL. I've been waiting for the 09 all summer. The wait was well worth it. Having driven the SHAWD RL, I wish I didn't have to sacrifice that option for the tech package but I wanted the audio upgrade more. I am very happy. The car handles great with a nice feel for the road. Plenty of power with a luxury interior. The audio and nav system is great. Big improvement over the 06RL.This car is really a cross between the TL and RL. I realize there are many choices out there for $40K. But for my money the 09 TL Tech fills my needs quite well. One more thing, just get in it and drive. Don't worry about all the tech stuff, settings, etc., figure out later.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Audio/Tech system. Just getting used to iPod thing so I miss the 6 CD changer. 5.1 audio is awesome. Weather updates incredible. Back/up camera, wow. I'm driving home backwards from work next week. Seats are very supportive and comfortable. Plenty of interior room. This car is a head turner. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This week I drove the first new TL SH-AWD off the lot here in NYC and this car is nothing short of an absolute black top carving rocket. I drove the front wheel drive model which was nice but can't hold a candle to the power and handling of the SH-AWD version. The tight power and control carves through turns and is every bit the powerful car Acura has ever built. The Tech package give you everything you could need from a fast, clear nav system with tons of features, iPhone integration including music and phonebook. I owned a TL from the previous generation and this new version improves on everything that I didn't like about the old version and the SH-AWD makes it into the car I always wanted.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having driven many competitive vehicles (bmw, lexus, audi, cadillac, infiniti, etc), the value of the 2009 TL is simply in a class of its own. With excellent power, a very comfortable ride, and an amazing tech package, this car has been a blast to own. Also, after a couple of 600 mile road trips, I am averaging 28 mpg highway and around 20 mpg in the city. Outstanding fuel economy for a car this powerful. I do miss having a RWD powertrain, but Acura has mostly eliminated the torque steer from their previous efforts, and I am sure the fwd helps with fuel economy. A little more body roll than I want, but a comparable 5 series bmw that offers better cornering was 15K+.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tech package is a blast, with iPod, bluetooth, doppler radar (crazy), and a nav system with 7M+ points of interest. Shift paddles make ramps and passing more fun, as well as engine breaking. Styling has actually gotten great reviews from friends as well as most passerby (many thumbs up)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A few weeks ago I purchased this 2009 Acura TL and absolutely love it! This Acura TL is super quiet, super smooth super fast and super solid. It tracks like a locomotive and never loses its composer. I traded a 2008 Lexus ES350 for this Acura and I am very proud of my decision. The Lexus felt cheap and sloppy when compared to this Acura TL. This is the best choice I made! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the car for about 2 weeks now and so far all I can say is awesome. Had an '04 Infiniti G35 AWD and it rattled like crazy. Then a '07 Lexus ES 350, great car but boring to drive and expensive with options. The new TL takes the best of both those cars and puts it into one attractive, fun to drive package. The nav. system and sound system are top notch. Fit and finish are great and with only 600 miles on the car I am avg. 20 mpg in the city, not bad for a car with 280 hp. The seats feel good and the steering wheel has a nice feel to it. The kid in me loves the paddle shifters.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2009 Acura is Superman with a Robin costume on. I'm sure there are some who love Robin's outfit but more I'm sure more prefer Supermans outfit. The styling is too love it or hate it in my opinion. Besides that Acura got it right. They really should get rid of the stock wheels as someone as mentioned too.

<TEXT>I am a fan of Acura cars, having owned a 2003 Acura TL, 2004 TL and 2008 TSX. Overall I found the 2009 TL to be an improvement over the 2004 TL, but there are some little things that I dislike: The soft armrest for your right elbow that slides forward that was present in preceding models is now gone. I miss this.The trunk lid is now higher so you have to lift things higher to put them in the trunk. When accelerating, the engine revs more than the older TLs. What I dislike most is that the steering is too light and feels unnatural. Pros: The interior feels luxurious and upscale. The navi is quicker and the screen sharper and brighter.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, this car is a great value for all that's included in the price. I like the bold exterior styling that sets it apart from all the other boring "vanilla" cars out there. Performance, handling, ride, features and build quality is much improved over the previous generation. Interior is also greatly improved and roomier than before. The nav system and ELS surround system are both top-notch. Fuel economy is also decent: I'm averaging about 20-21 in city driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav system w/live traffic and doppler radar is incredible! Quiet ride. Quick throttle response. Very good handling and braking for a FWD car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Engine is smooth and powerful, but produces some torque steer on the FWD model. Without the AWD option its easily the best value compared to competitors. This car is a geek's best friend. The interior is full of innovative technologies such as a nav system that routes around bad weather and automatic climate control that tracks the sun's position in the sky. The stereo is impressive, but the built-in hard drive is limited to playing ripped CDs, no directly loading mp3 files. The car is very easy to control with electronic steering and downshifting the transmission for engine braking is extremely smooth. But it would be nice if Honda moved to a 6-speed or better to match Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a 1999 Acura TL with Navi and drove that for 120,000 miles. It was a very good car. 10 years later, Acura does it again. I had to get used to the front and rear end of the car, but after a couple of weeks I love the design changes. If you put any other car next to it, other cars just look dated. The standard wheels that come with the car are my biggest complaint. This car really deserves the upgraded wheels which cost me an extra 2500 dollars. I got the ones that are two tone. There are way too many advanced features that I wont list all of them. Go to your Acura dealership and check out the tech package. It simply blows away anything else out there. I am very happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had a 2005 Mercedes E500 4Matic and was looking for a car that had the same size engine and same size interior. Have had the TL SH AWD HPT for over a month and this car does not disappoint. The handling is unbelievable and the power/acceleration is very good. Drove the G37x and the CTS 4 and the TL was just a better car for the money. The ride can be a little stiff and you can feel the bumps on a rough road which is why I gave a rating of 8 for comfort. Overall, though, the ride is good and the cabin is very quiet. Also, the tech package is a must. Easy to use and I use the real time weather a lot more than I thought I would. And I like the front/back design. It is edgy/different.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Technology package; handling; paddle shifters; sound quality of the stereo system (I find myself not wanting to get out of the car); gas mileage is surprisingly better than I thought it would be; interior quality (just feels/looks luxurious); seats--they just hug your body; engine power/acceleration.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I absolutely love the styling inside and out. There has been some criticism in the press about looks, but to me it looks strikingly different and fresh. Same with the inside. There's a knock on the the multitude of buttons, bit I rarely go to the console because everything is voice activated, and besides, that's so much more fun. The novelty of saying "set driver temperature 70 degrees" still isn't wearing off. Being a Honda, I'm sure reliability will be bullet proof. Acceleration is OK, but I do give it low scores for handling - my only disappointment. Once you set up for a turn it's stable and secure, but transitions and aggressive moves are not this car's forte. Still, a great car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tech package gives you features that cost $15K extra in the German cars. You pop in a CD and guess what? It's automatically copied to the hard drive.

<TEXT>Coming from a 08 TL. Test drove many times both AWD & FWD w/ tech. Got a mixed feeling like other 08 TL owners did. Technology beats other competitors like G37 or 08 TL. But not sure why such an advanced car has to skip auto-dimmed side mirrors, ventilated seats, rain-sensing wiper, etc. On a 08' TL I don't have to pay for the tech package to get ELS sound system and the perforated leather. Still a very good car for the price level, but option-wise, you want to ask yourself what's really important to you vs. what it has to offer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I live in New England and drive 33,000 miles a year for my sales position. I recently purchased 09 TL AWD with the Tech Package. I upgraded from a 2004 Honda Accord V6 that had 163K Miles on it. What convinced me to buy and Acura was the reliability of my Honda and the trade-in value of my car. When the dust settled I walked out the door paying $30K with my trade-in. I looked at several competitors but kept coming back to Acura. The handling of the TL AWD and the Tech Package won me over. I plan to keep the car for 5-years and expect it will be very reliable and hold it's value when it comes time to trade it in. If you don't look at the TL you miss out on an excellent vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Okay...At first I didn't like the styling of the new TL. But I have to admit it has grown on me. I love the sexy shape, the way it handles, and the well designed interior. Before purchasing the TL, I test drove the Lexus IS 250 and the BMW 325I. The IS was too slow (4cyl engine in a 35K dollar vehicle??) and the BMW didn't offer much in terms of standard equipment. I basically chose the TL as I felt I got more bang for my buck. And we all know Acura makes quality vehicles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My TL handles so well and is one of the most comfortable rides I've had, especially upgrading from a Honda Prelude. The voice recognition for the Navi, Climate Control, and radio is awesome. It's still a bit of a learning curve though, but one of the best features. The TL has provided me with the best driving experience thus far.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigator is so awesome, such a great upgrade from a Garmin. The voice recognition makes everything so easy to handle, from the radio to the climate control.

<AUTHOR>Honest Review</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Recently purchased a new SH-AWD with Tech package. Pros: 1) Easy to use navigation 2) Inside layout's neat and makes sense. 3) Bigger interior spaces and more room for back seats. 4) Push button engine start. 6) Price is right compared to other competitors. Cons: 1) suspension is too stiff that you can feel every tiny, tiny bump of the road. Any ride longer than 10 minutes in the city is not enjoyable. 2) back trunk is relatively high for putting away heavier objects and it's small as well. 3) Some of the interior materials feel cheap: plastic of door pockets bring the car down. 4) seats are not comfortable as the previous two TL models I had driven. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first new car and what a car it is. Fun to drive and the technology can be overwhelming sometimes but still great. I already put 500 miles on my car after just 1 week because I want to drive it everyday. The SH-AWD is great, the car is glued to the road during all types of conditions. I'm averaging 28MPG on the highway and I've seen has high as 40mpg.</TEXT>

I've waited 5 months to put this review up...I have no real complaints except the ride is a bit firm for my tastes after the Volvo and I'd expect better than 22mpg these days...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my new TL w/ Tech for almost 3 weeks and I have to say that I am really enjoying this car. I was leasing a 2006 Infiniti G35x and was contemplating a new one. After driving the new TL I was no longer interested in the G. The TL has a new exterior design that turns heads. The interior of the TL blows the Infiniti away. Everything feels solid and of very high quality. I have also been getting better gas mileage than I got in my old G35x. There is no other car in this price range that gives you the quality and the amenities found in the TL.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The SH-AWD model is not a car...it's an automobile. The seats hug your body. The steering wheel grips your hands. The sound system is an on-demand DJ. And the power is to be compared to a 200 meter sprinter...not super fast... but fast. But, the coolest thing about the car is its smarts. My wife keeps her key in her bag. She attempted to put her bag with the key in the trunk and the car beeped and popped back open the truck. Oh yes, I am most certainly enjoying my 2009 TL SH-AWD. :)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sound system. It has so many options to play music (Hard Drive, USB for (IPOD/MP3/flash drive), XM, FM, AM). It's a personal DJ. I never have to worry on the trips when I need to hear some good music. :)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had an Infiniti M35x and wanted a cheaper monthly payment without sacrificing the luxury. Looked at BMW 3 and Volkswagen CC. BMW was too expensive and everything was extra and VW was a little too small. The TL had everything I wanted standard (heated seats, sunroof and bluetooth). Dealer added the decklid spoiler for free. Engine is powerful and seats are comfortable. A little more road noise comes in than I would have liked. Dash layout is nice, looks modern and sporty. Steering is nice and tight. Fuel economy is great (22+) considering I averaged 14 mpg with the M35. I like the ipod connectivity. Good sounding stereo. I like this car a lot. </TEXT>

The G37 was great to drive but has unimpressive interior and feels small , the ES350 is very comfortable to ride but un- sporty to drive and large, the TL has amazing interior, advanced technology package, fun to drive and but ugly grill (beak).

<TEXT>Had taken my 2008 TL Type S in for some routine maint and given the 2009 TL. Must say I was not disappointed but not overly impressed. Kinda left me feeling a bit ho-hum *yawn*. The styling of the 2009 TL is confusing. It's as if they attempted to include everything on the exterior and the result is just big question mark. What was the statement? The interior is just as confusing with all its swoops and swirls... definite disconnection. The ride was comfortable, stereo sounded great, seats comfortable. Acceleration was quite lacking as I've become accustomed to much more in my 08 Type S. Overall not a disappointing ride, however, nothing spectacular. The Tech package is extraordinary.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Tested both base and SH-AWD. Would have been a great car to buy...but base model seats are too hard, could feel pressure in the lumbar area. SH-AWD ride is too firm...lots of noise driving over reflectors on the road etc. Lots of reviews from extensive research say ride is too firm for a luxury car. Also, unfortunately...armrests are decorative and not functional...just leather covering over a hard surface. Comfort is important to me...resting my elbows on hard surfaces while driving does not work well. Too bad...most manufacturers do not think of this, even Lexus. American cars are much better on comfort...been driving GM for 20 years. Although the 09 Maxima does offer great comfort.</TEXT>

We have 575 miles on the car, and 530 miles was on the first tank of gas, and I was getting over 26 miles per gallion. Love styling, high quality, ride is firm but very planted, great sound system, polished metal exterior, what a class act and love the paddle shifters and dealer will install rear spoiler Tuesday to really set off the beautiful rear of the car, also love the exhaust tips as they look awsome. Manual way too thick and confusing, roomy rear seat, big trunk, and we just love the sleek hunkered down look.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a pearl white 2009 TL with the Tech package. I owned 3 Audi A4's previously and loved them but felt the 2009 price for the A4 and BMW 335 was becoming an issue. This car is very well built and has very good road manners. It grows on me every day and I have no regrets about my decision to buy a TL. I was taken back by the size of the car at first, but now it is second nature and I appreciate the room. It may not be completely as crisp to drive as a BMW or Audi, but in many ways it feels better and is very solid. It is a pleasure to drive and to own! I upgraded to the stock SHAWD 18" wheels and highly suggest you do the same..really enhances road handling and appearance. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After test driving 3 different 2009 TLs w/Tech while my 2007 TL was in the shop I found it was improved in many areas but took a few steps backwards that would keep me from trading my 2007 TL for a new 2009 TL - not worth the price difference. Main issues was worse city mileage; 09 ratings are supposed to be fairly accurate, 07 ratings were high by 10-20%. Both were rated at 18. Driving my 07 conservatively I can get 19-20, driving the 09 the same way only got 16-17.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very satisfied with my purchase... with a few exceptions. The gas mileage is not very good. I did my research and expected this. However, in city driving, I am only averaging 14.3 mpg (according to the computer). Hopefully, the mpg will get better as more miles are racked up. I have had nothing but raves from friends and co-workers about the exterior and interior of the car. I chose Palladium Metallic with the taupe interior. I think this combination looks very good on the car. Not one person has mentioned the "beak". I am not someone who likes to spend money so I did a lot of research before purchasing this Acura.

Every detail was thought of, even windshield wipers that no longer leave a streak of water on the windshield in front of driver's eyes. The interior is very high tech, functional and not boring. The suspension is now softer and the bumps are forgiving. It's wider and longer, so it gives you a lot more space. The tech package makes this car even better.

<TEXT>This is the first car I've ever driven that really handles like it's on rails!! The SH-AWD system is amazing, and after driving it back to back against the 335i and G37, there's simply no comparison. While the other two might be a little quicker in a straight line, they can't match the handling of this car. Plus, their interiors looked really cheap compared to how luxurious the TL is, and both felt really cramped. Concerning all the comments about the exterior, I have to admit I wasn't sure about it at first. But the more I look at the car the more I love it. I've never had a vehicle that turns so many heads. I had two guys in their 20's compliment the car saying it was "tight"!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an engineering marvel. It is the most intuitive vehicle I've ever driven. You think about going around a corner and you're there. The ride is a little stiff but that's the price one pays for the performance, at least until you get into cars costing three times as much. The gas mileage isn't great, but after all its not a hybrid. Still, if you go easy on it, it's a lot better than you'd expect. The interior controls are overwhelming at first, but once learned are easy to use. The exterior styling stands out and I predict will be a harbinger of things to come across all makes. The tech options are second to none. I assume it will be as reliable as my last TL, so well done Acura.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is built like a tank. Totally solid. Every detail seems to have been thought thru thoroughly. Suspension on the FWD car is just perfect. Not too firm, almost no body lean in turns (the SH-AWD car was too firm for me). The technology in this car is amazing and it all works so seamlessly. I've never seen a better nav system and I come from owning a Lexus ES350. The screen is gorgeous. Power is incredible for a car that gets this kind of mpg. Everything about this car suggests that it should cost $10-15k more. At around $36k it's undoubtedly the best bargain in the automotive world. I like this car better than my friend's E-Class.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our 3rd TL after owning the 02 & 06. Ride and comfort are excellent. After looking at Cadillac, Lexus, Infinity & BMW this is the best quality for the $$. The Tech package is outstanding, we love it. The ride improvement is excellent. Drove the 4-wheel version, yes it has more HP and is faster but you give up the smooth ride for the firmer sport ride. The 06 TL was the best road car we have ever had, can't wait to get the 09 on the road. The seats are better than Lexus. The rear leg room is much better than the 06. I do miss the blue dash lights that was in the 06 TL. It's a buyers market, got a great deal. Like the new lines, but the front end needs to grow on you.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tech package with live weather updates, traffic updates, radar, + new features. Love the idea of the HDD to record CD's. Great audio system, CD Audio. Great location of the Nav system and control knob. Better placement of controls on steering wheel. Better turning ratio, tighter. Side profile.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is nothing short of awesome. I love the Acura pricing policy. Just two choices: AWD/FWD and tech/non-tech. Unbelievable how much quality and technology you get for ~$35k. In size, features, comfort and appointments, the car is competitive with mid sized sports sedans costing $17-20k more (think: 5 series, E-class, A6). It drives like a dream. Steering is razor sharp, suspension is just the perfect combination of compliant and firm (the SH-AWD package was too firm for my taste). Real time traffic, weather, Zagat restaurant ratings/descriptions, nav system and screen that is truly state of the art (MUCH better than any of the Germans or the G35/37), audio system that has no peer, etc.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav screen clarity is like going from a 13" black and white TV to a 54" 1080p HDTV, razor sharp handling and power, interior fit and finish, seat comfort (both front and back), audio system with full ipod integration and hard disc memory for CD's and MP3 files, xenon headlights. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm a tall driver (6'6") and finally found a "fit" in the new TL. What an upgrade from my '99 Chevy Malibu! Averaging about 24 MPG and love the performance. Beautiful interior with great features - Voice-activated blue tooth, XM, Universal link garage opener, and this is all in the base model. Exterior is beautiful, even getting used to the Bucky beaver front-end. Overall, design is great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In a world of $55k+ 5 Series, A6's and E-Classes, this thing is an absolute steal. SOTA nav system and screen, real time weather/traffic, keyless entry/start, real leather, full ipod integration, hard disc drive to store CDs, moonroof, xenon headlights, tilt/telescope steering wheel, seat memories, power driver/passenger seats, tremendous interior room, amazingly sized back seat all for $36k. I felt like I was stealing it. Great ride and handling on the FWD model. Drove the SH- AWD and gotta tell you it's a hard ride. I'm in NYC so no way was I getting that. If you live where the roads are like glass, that may be your car, but with potholes, watch out! The FWD car handles potholes perfectly!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Between my wife & me we have owned 4 Acura cars (starting with a 1992 Legend) over the past 17 years. We traded a 1999 TL for the 2009 TL. What really sets off the new TL is its sculpted looks and flowing lines; however, I must admit that the front grille is a bit overdone. Although the dash controls look complicated, they are well marked and do not take long to figure out. Seats are comfortable (but not pillow like), with great support for the back. The brakes on this TL are much better than any Acura I have ever owned and the drive is smooth and quite with very precise steering.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had this car for a few days but I absolutely love it so far. The looks were iffy at first but have really grown on me for the models with black exterior/black interior. The handling is superb - it doesn't roll much but has a soft highway ride at the same time. The brakes are awesome and I love the electric steering - absolutely no play = precision. So far there isn't anything I don't like about this. This is a great value for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After having the 2005 TL AND the 2007 TL both with the navigation system, I figured I would give this car a shot since I LOVED my previous TLs. Not to my surprise, this car was the best car that I have driven. Not only is the drive comfortable and quiet, but the technology n the car itself is phenomenal. You will not find these features in ANY other car in its class or price point and you will definitely get noticed on the road. Money well spent! You will NOT be disappointed! Nothing compares to this NEW TL!</TEXT>

<TEXT>How do you love everything about a car, but when it comes to how hard it rides, it ruins all the other feeling, emotions and realities you have. Acura missed on using the wrong tires and suspension and shock settings. If I wanted a harder ride then a Ferrari, I would have gotten a different four door sedan. This is painful!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Decent car to drive, unfortunately my daughter owns 08 328i and Acura loses again. I like the car for what it offers in terms of technology and features for the price; however, driving experience, interior design (finish) and outside look is far from good. The cheap look and feel of silver plastic trim and wired feeling driving makes me feel like in Honda Accord! After driving for a month I love the electronics, hate the MPG (really bad). Bottom line is, if you are 50+ (like me) and take life carefully, it's a great car for you; but if you like to feel the car, take corners with engineered perfection and avoid car with vegetable slicer between the lights, get a bmw! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Car tech package is the highlight of the car, I don't think there is a car made anywhere in the world that compares with it. The radio and navigation packages are simple to use and the resolution of the navigation screen is almost high definition. The overall quality of the car is also top notch, it is a very well made car. And the ride is that of a luxury car, it does not ride like a sports car. So it's fun to drive on the expressway, when you are going 70 mph, but around town it doesn't handle like a sports car. A little boring in the city. I did not get the all wheel drive package, but the front wheel drive worked fine in Chicago winter. </TEXT>

<TEXT>There are so many things to love about this super special car. The handling, the power, the looks... all impressive! The leather seats, the audio system and navigation are all standouts and would be expected in card twice the price, so there is some value here. That is the good stuff, what needs work is the harsh ride and engine noise in the cabin. The tires and wheel combination look cool, but when you feel every bump and crease it get to be cumbersome, to say the least.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought this car and really have enjoyed it. I got the tech package with my vehicle and it is taking me some time to get accustomed to all the features the car has to offer. I really like the hard drive and USB feature on the car. It does ride very smoothly and handles very well on the road. It is well worth the $$. I test drove the BMW 328 and 335 series and liked the Acura TL much better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've waited for this car since first trying the 2005 RL, which I found to be too soft. This 2009 TL is really superior. Even in low speeds, on side streets, there's no feeling of nose-heavy understeer. On highway on/off ramps, in spite of having had snow, sleet and wet pavement, it's been holding the road as if on rails. The brakes are superb - which is the first time in an Acura (I've owned six before), that I do not feel that need to be upgraded. So as I stated, this car is, definitely, much better then all Acuras that I greatly enjoyed before, as well as much beyond my expectations of it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats fit like a glove. Road holding, transmission and motor are all incredible. Sound system, Blue Tooth phone connection and heating/ventilation are smooth and well done. Superb ergonomics and high quality materials.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my 97 Acura CL. The new 09 TL has the wow factor. So many cars on the road today all look the same. Once again Acura has brought a bold new look on the road. I didn't want to pay for a Big L on the back of my trunk. Blending with the rest of the crowd does not work for me. I am an Acura fan all the way.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my new TL for 2 weeks and am in love with it. Traded in my 2007 G35x and do not miss it one bit. interior is large and fit and finish is top notch. reviews regarding steering are not accurate. Steering is spot-on and effort is just right. controls are intimidating at first but make perfect sense after a few days. gas mileage is great for this class, and as far as the styling goes, even stubborn anti-car girlfriend loves it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. Previous had a 04 TL and a 07 Type S TL. Must admit at first was not a fan of front design, but after a while I love it. It evokes emotion from everyone who sees it. It is a much better car than previous models. The navi is 100% improved from previous models. The AWD system is the best, I drove a Lexus AWD and this beats it hands down.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2008 Type S and loved it. My only complaint about this car was the FWD, always spinning when I needed grip. Most of this problem was made moot when I drove home my SH-AWD two days before the big snowfall in Seattle. I now have 500 miles on my SH-AWD, I can tell you that unless you've taken the SH-AWD in 10 degrees with a foot of compact snow & ice on mountain roads, gliding around corners above freeway speed limits when others could just as well be peddling their cars, you really don't have the data needed to write a review. I'll give you that look of the nose and rear of the body as it comes from Acura aren't as cool looking as the 08 Type S, but those two panels could be painted.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was in the market for a new sedan and shopped Infiniti G37 and Lexus ES. Stumbled onto the re-designed TL and...WOW!!! This car is a real eye-catcher. Bold new lines, aggressive styling, and it drives like it has more than 280HP. I decided to buy it after one test drive. Very fun to drive, and really decent mileage for a car with this much zip. I love this TL!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the new TL. This is my third TL in a row (04' and 06') and it is by far the best one I've every owned. Like many I was skeptical about the exterior styling, but I've had nothing but thumbs up. I live in Canada and with the winter tires it handles fantastically well. I love the iPod interface and the bluetooth. I also love the ticker steering wheel, I only wish it was heated. I also love the paddle shifters and that you can shift gears while the transmission is still in drive. I'm a little disappointed in some of the material used like the interior door handle. Overall I definitely would recommend this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first TL and I now understand all the hype surrounding Acura engineering. The attention to details, the technology, superior handling in snow and ice conditions, and respectable performance for a luxury sports sedan. Looked at Mercedes, BMW and Caddy... no contest!! I really enjoy all the conveniences and I am quickly getting a handle on the voice activated command system. Keyless start is a really is a nice feature as well. Paddle shifters really makes it feel like a performance vehicle. The safety features are second to none, meeting 2010 standards today!</TEXT>
