<TEXT>My dad got this car as a loan while his CLK was in the shop and I felt the need to write a review for it. First, this car is very fun to drive and has great handling and performance. The rear seats are another story. The way the back doors are shaped makes you trip almost every time you get out of the back. They contour around the wheel inserts. Making for a very uncomfortable entry/exit. Just look at a side view of the car and you'll see how the back doors are shaped. It has a very well made interior and exterior. The navigation system is pretty confusing, though. It's a pretty good car overall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I liked the 2006 ML so much I got a 2009 ML when my lease was up. The 2009 gas mileage averages around 10mpg in the city and 15mpg on the hwy. Compared to 15mpg in city and 22 mpg that i got with the 2006. The handling on the 2006 was great and fun to drive, the 2009 doesnt have steering with as much feel, it feels more like a bus. No feedback. I think the steering wheel is also bigger in this year but not sure. THe fake leather seats do not compare to the comfort of the leather seats i had previously. THe rear bumper design with the color coating is really dumb but a good way for the dealers to make extra money when you turn in the car. It scratches easily</TEXT>

<TEXT>This has been a wonderful driving experience .The Diesel is very smooth and quiet and the highway milage is regularly over 28 mpg with average usually around 25 including city. The interior systems are fun and easy. The lift gate is great and at the right height to the ground and the space is more than ample.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this truck for around a month now and I am very impressed. It flat moves and is stable doing so. I purchased it to replace a 2002 C class MB that I loved but missed having room to haul anything. So far it's two thumbs up! Anxious to take a road trip in the next 2 months. Vegas to Denver should be a good test. Maybe a bit of off road testing hopefully. The gas millage isn't anything to write about at this point but it's only got 1000 miles on it. It feels like a Benz... That's the best part!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchase this since we needed something relatively large - but were very concerned about getting a gas guzzler SUV. So far, so good - this SUV is a great solution. Getting 24+ on the highway and plenty of room and comfort. No quality issues so far, but it hasn't been long - initial build quality seems outstanding.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well it time for an update on my ML550. I put on 6,000 miles and so far not much problem to report. I had to make one stop to the dealer to date and that was for a recall notice I receive to fix some hydraulic problem and tail light seal. The truck was drop off in the morning and i picked it up about three hours later. some noticeable comments: 1) there is a click noise in the cold when you first start the car. 2) With the window down a loud noise is heard when switching from park to drive or reverse. The dealer said this is normal and is due to the large solonoid. 3) The radio went off but no display came on. The radio came back on after the vichele was turn off and back again. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>like the style and ride comfort, nav is easy to use, sound system is great too. reliability to date is good since I did not have to make any unplan trip to the dealer. Will give update at 10,000 miles </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Since I do a lot of highway driving, at times in bad weather conditions, I feel I need a SUV. This MB beat my previous luxury Japanese SUV hands down, in terms of ride, braking, offroad (something the previous SUV just couldn't handle)and mileage. It sure cost more but the extra cost is worth it. Mileage is very good and one can't tell that it's a diesel engine. Using the cruise control significantly enhances mileage on highways. The transmission and engine deliver power smoothly. Diesel engines beat out hybrids when hauling heavy stuff and the ML320 has class-leading towing capacity. So far, no problems with reliability. Looks like MB has fixed the problems of the previous generation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I buy a new car about every two years and just traded in a Jeep Commander Limited with a Hemi in for this new oil burning Benz. All I can say is: WOW. This truck is the bomb, I have only driven it about 1,000 miles so far but am averaging 30mpg on the highway and about 22mpg in town. I got nearly every option, including prem packages 1 and 2 (keyless entry) and leather, etc. The ML320 is like an S class in overshoes, the ride is first rate and the gas mileage is simply amazing for such a large vehicle. The only complaint I have is that from 0-10 mph it is a little herky jerky until the turbo kicks in then it flies. The fit and finish is typical MB and is my #1 choice in a luxury SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in our Landrover and we enjoyed the LR3 while we had it. We drove all the other competitors in this price range. The general overall feel and construction of this suv will impress you. It is on a whole different level when you compare to the others. The lexus felt like a toy....We had two BMW's prior this purchase and wanted something different. I cant believe anyone would choose the RX Lexus over the MB. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The steering is something that I can't put into words. Everything feels good in this car. Just close the door and listen. Turning radius is among the best.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you never thought an SUV was for you, add the 2009 MB 320 BlueTech diesel to your list because it handles very well, has lots of room inside, is safe, lots of TORQUE and is economical mileage-wise. I have observed 22 MPG city stop/go driving.With the most conservative driving style I've observed 30 MPG highway driving in an SUV not in an economy car! Be gentle on the throttle when pulling away from stop lights and use cruise control on the highway. The turning circle radius is good and the steering for tight parking is very easy to maneuver. The front and rear parktronic option is a must. The styling of the redesigned model is a huge improvement. Very masculine. Highly recommended</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have worked for Mercedes for over 10 years. Always known it's the safest car in the world and the craftsmenship is A+. Finally I leased one and even more excited then I could have imagined. There is no one noise at 80mph+. The stereo system with over 600watts is awesome. The suspension system with the upgrades to agility control cant be beat. It even almost makes sharper u-turns than my motorcycle. The Nav is hard drive based and is almost immediate when using. The voice control system is awesome and can even be tweaked to understand people with accents, like my wife who is from Romania. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was all ready to purchase the larger GL SUV but this ML350 offered far easier driving/maneuvering plus good MPG while still providing excellent interior space. I have enjoyed this vehicle and have become aclimated to peculiarities such as low indicator location and overly complex button crazed Command system. Push the dash info button and even without the NAV turned on, the car displays the street, town and heading you are driving on. Neat. Handling, suspension is sophisticated. Loaded with 700# of big people (4), the 350 drove virtually the same as if unladen. It didn't even squat as my previous big GM SUV did when loaded. MPG has been the big surprise. It gets 17/23.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ive had the ML-350 for 4 weeks now with 1000 miles, performance is acceptable. I have been disappointed with the car. Few days after owning the vehicle, started the vehicle in garage, noticed two problems, 1. white smokes (only happened once). 2. Notice an engine knocks on cold start (listen carefully- make sure radio is off). Squeals noise coming from steering column and passenger driver. Drive Seat moves (under my knee) during acceleration. Rough idle. More wind noise than my Ford SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Absolutely impressed with the performance and handling. The styling is aggressive, but tasteful. The acceleration is excellent for a rather heavy "small" SUV. Steering is elegant and smooth. Shifting is excellent. A bit sluggish on an uphill during hwy cruise, but if you push on the gas it responds nicely. The nav is typical of European cars, however, it is functional and one should not be too picky. Likewise, the turn signal is a little lower on the stalk, but takes 15 min to get used to it. The gear shift is great. Electronic shift is great. All said, a definite buy! </TEXT>

The Benz is by far the best combination of luxury, performance, safety and styling for the money. We are completely blown away by the driving characteristics and features of this vehicle. It is light years ahead of its predecesor, the ML320, which was a stubby, truck-based abomination. This thing is an E-class with some ride height and storage space. If you're considering an SUV in this price range, you must drive this car. My only complaints are the position of the cruise control stalk and the learning curve on all the features. Gas mileage is as bad as the Rover.</TEXT>
