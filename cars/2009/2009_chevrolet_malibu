<TEXT>I chose to get an '09 Malibu LT2 for my company vehicle, and I'm very happy with it. I've put over 40,000 miles on within 10 months and never had a problem. It is full of luxury options, and is sporty and comfortable to drive. In the past I've driven a '03 Jetta, '08 Grand Prix, and then this Malibu. The Malibu is my favorite by far. Overall, it just feels solidly constructed and of very high quality.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The bluetooth connectivity, XM radio, steering wheel controls, heated seats & mirrors, leather steering and shift nob, optional manual shifting, remote starter, external audio plug in for I- Pod. And last but not least, the blue "mood" lighting that shines down on shift area and inside door handles.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have put 4500 miles on this car in less than 3 mo. Beautiful car. Exterior is as good as any European model. Interior is great. Took awhile to get use to the 6 spd auto trans its ok now. Think the 2.4engine might be a little too small for the tranny. If I was to do again would get larger engine. Fuel mileage not as good as advertised. Only 27-28 highway. Sort of unhappy about the fuel mileage as this is the main reason I purchased the car. I drive 60 miles highway per day. Best ever got was 30mpg. Very few things I would change. Love my chevy anyway.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Body panel fit is great, quality of interior is beautiful, looks like it was designed after the 69 vette interior. Head turner.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love to support my American Cars but when I got a job traveling the east coast I opted to buy a Honda Accord. Recently our company forced us to use rental cars and we are stuck with this malibu. After driving around 500-680miles on a tank of gas to going to 400-475miles I was less than impressed. I'm 6'4" and this car is less roomy than my Accord.I feel extremely cramped while i'm sitting here typing this headed to florida from North Carolina (co-worker driving 1st shift). The car looks nice and runs well. Interior not so pretty but its a rental so I'll suffice. The radio is lacking features also. Steering is much sloppier than the accord. It does have a smooth ride too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Dash compartment is a very nice addition. The coloring on the instrument is very nice and easy on the eye.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this car for 8 months and love everything about it. The styling and quality are great and it's perfect for a family of four. I also had the unfortunate experience of having another driver run a red light and hit my front end going about 30 mph. The Malibu performed quite admirably in the accident, definitely living up to the 5-star rating it received in crash tests. Thankfully, I walked away unharmed and my Chevy dealer was able to fix the car completely within a couple weeks. So far, I haven't noticed anything different about the car since the accident, which was four months ago. The performance of this car, before, during and after the accident has been great ! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, both interior and exterior, safety, very solid vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is not for people who drive in the country. The paint allows common driving on grid roads to take the paint off down to the steel, chips the windows and lights. The open hubcaps allow mud to get next to the wheel and causes a shimmy in the steering wheel. The trunk is alot smaller then my 2005 Malibu, the ride is good but the tires do not have traction. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought new in January 2009. I was attracted by the exterior styling, the two tone interior and the fuel economy. I like the quiet ride and overall feel of the car. With 9,500 miles on the car there are absolutely no problems. Fuel economy is better than the EPA rated. I live in a rural area & my city driving has very few stops. I keep an Excel spreadsheet for fuel economy and the calculated economy is even better than the readings on the dash. The lifetime fuel economy so far is 30.4 mpg overall. The 2.4 engine is quiet and reasonable for acceleration (not a hot rod). </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned this Mailbu for 5 months and love it. People constantly come up and compliment the car. I have owned several GM cars and I cannot understand why some people don't like them. They have all been good cars with lots of miles on them. However this Malibu is the best yet. I get well over 30 MPG on the highway and 23-25 in the city. Remote start is great...</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in our 2006 Chevrolet Impala LT for a 2009 Chevrolet Malibu LS, what an improvement. The Impala's a good car, but the Malibu is an excellent car. It rides really smooth, feels well put together, is designed well inside and out and is a good value. It comes with ABS, traction and stability control, six airbags, OnStar with turn- by-turn directions, Sirius-XM radio and so much more all standard. Ours had no options. We love the golden pewter metallic color which looks light blue sometimes and gray/silver others, depending on the light. When driving, the car feels planted, don't be afraid to hit the gas around a curve. Brakes that could stop a train are great too. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable, good looking and well- bolstered seats. OnStar with turn-by- turn directions. Sirius-XM radio. Design inside and out. Quietest car I've ever driven. Smooth and powerful four cylinder and four speed automatic. New car smell!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Mine is a LS with 4 cyl engine. Gas mileage is okay at about 25 mpg average, but this car handles better than any GM car I've ever driven, and seats are comfy too. If GM made more cars like this, they would't be on the verge of collapse. This is a fleet vehicle for me, and while I like it a lot, I would choose an Accord, Mazda 6, or Altima if I were buying with my own cash. All in all, a very nice vehicle though.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling is really good. Seats are supportive & comfortable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased an LTZ with the 6 cylinder engine after testing the 4 and finding it a bit sluggish. While only in the first month of ownership, I've been delighted. The cabin is comfortable, pleasing to the eye, and very quiet. The sound system is a joy. Last night I heard low frequencies in the Saint- Saens organ concerto I'd never noticed before. The leather seats are very supportive, especially in the back-- where I appreciate the firmness. The six comes with hydraulic steering that gives just the right feedback. Mileage so far is satisfactory--19.7 mpg on short hauls around town. Glad I got the six--it has pickup that reminds me of my Dad's 65 Chrysler 300. It's eager to go.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats, power and handling, the quiet and solid feel, strong headlights, sound system, OnStar. Great car for the money.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I owned a base model Malibu previously - and knew that they were reliable cars. This time, I wanted the nicest car I could get. Heated leather seats, remote start, and sunroof were on the top of my list. I expected to pay $30K for this car. Husband got it for $24K. It's quiet, looks classy, and is fun to drive. A good choice all around.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the radio. You can mix and match AM, FM and XM on the presetsI also love the auto climate control - set the temp you want and forget about it - no adjusting when you get too warm or too cold. And somehow it 'knows' when the windshield needs to defrots/defog.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Excellent vehicle - good fuel economy, power (for a 4 cylinder), rides and handles excellent, comfortable seats, and is quiet! Drive one - see for yourself how nice it is! 4 cylinder engine and 6 speed auto rans are matched well - vehicle shifts smoothly and is very quite for a 4 cylinder. trans is always in teh proper gear, it don''t hunt like other competitiors I drove. Radio controls are very intuitive, I didn't even have to read the manual to program the stations - which by the way you are not limited to one set of AM, one set of FM , and one set of XM - you can mix and match your presets in the order you want- very nice! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Two-tone leather interior! 6 speed automatic with manual tap shift. Fuel ecomony. Did I mention it is quiet - no engine drone! Bluetooth phone connection. 36 preset radio stations that can be randomly selected from AM, FM, or XM. Can set equalizer for each individual station.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did a lot of homework and drove a lot of cars before purchasing my Malibu. I am very pleased so far with most everything. It doesn't ride or acclerate like my Caddy, but it is fun to drive, and I can afford to drive over the mountain without taking out a loan for fuel. I don't know what to expect over the long haul with the 6 speed, it does a lot of shifting, but I have 100 K to decide if I want to keep it. I spent more on it than I intended, but I couldn't find some features that I wanted on the LS. Overall, a nice American product.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the red jewell coat. Lots of leg room, I am over 6'2" and I can stretch compared to the Lacrosse, (my other candidate. Great interior design in general, and looks great on the outside. Circular dash trim reminds me of the Park Avenue. Great wheels.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This has to be one of the best cars I've ever owned, including a Cadillac CTS. Everything is just perfect on this car. The V-6 has real go power, and I'm averaging 23 MPG in mixed driving. The fit and finish is wonderful. The car is so quiet that I sometimes have to look at the tach to see if it is running at stoplights. All of you import buyers are really missing out on a great car. I tested Toyota and there is no comparison.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased car to support American economy and ingenuity after 25 years of foreign purchases. Found that the car has hidden flaws. Rear side panels become detached by a slight push inward. Took it back to dealer and I was told it was designed to come apart at impact. Cannot believe engineers would think this way after decades of safety improvements. The dealer also found out the most of its other Malibus on the lot had the same defect. I am very dissapointed, especially after what I had heard about the vehicle. I am very hesitant to buy "American" again, especially after the local dealer has been very deceptive after discovery of this problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned for a little over a month. Love almost everything about it, except - the seat hugs me, love the heat options in the seats and I haven't been able to all the station preprogram radio options. it seems that my legs are too long for the design of the seat and the height of the steering wheel. Getting in is not as comfy and quick. I have to sit and swing in. I have tried to adjust everything every which way. Also it's a little tight for car seat behind me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I switched to Japanese imports because of the poor experiences I've had with US car models. After reading the JD Power review on the new Malibu, and test driving every import model in this class, (Accord, Camry, Altima, Mazda6), I decided to take a chance again on a Chevy. The car is great! I love the quiet, smooth ride. The interior is well designed and very comfortable. And I was able to buy the features I wanted without having to upgrade to expensive features I didn't want. I also spoke to someone who use to work with GM and found out GM put a lot of work into making the Malibu a top quality car, which sold me on the concept that this car would last as long as the Asian imports. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The quietest car in its class. Has the smoothest ride. Better gas mileage with the 4 cyl. 6 speed automatic trans. Lots of leg room front and back. Deep trunk. Dashboard compartment. (I keep my tollway pass device in there. Works great!)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have brought a few American cars that have left me disappointed. After reading the reviews for the Malibu, I decided to give them one more try. Well I am extremely satisfied as well as impressed that it looks like Chevrolet really got it right. This car is loaded with plenty of cool options, is extremely fun and comfortable to drive. The looks are really nice as well. I got the jewel red color and it really sets off the car nicely. I am getting around 28 mpg avg which is great in the current economic times is really great. I highly recommed you at least test drive one of these cars if you are in the market for a mid size sedan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have only had the car a week, but so far I am very pleased. This is my first American car in 30 years. In interest of full discclosure, I did begin the decison process wanting to "buy American" this time, as long as I did not have to make too many concessions to quality, drive experience etc. that I have come to expcet from European and Japanese cars. No compromise in this vehicle I can detect so far! Thanks for getting this vehicle right GM!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was an import owner for 20+ years before purchasing a Malibu. I was skeptical, even after a lot of research. But after 1500 miles, I'm really amazed. GM has done a great job. The interior is incredibly quiet. The interior styling is wonderful, especially in beige with suede seats. There's wonderful attention to detail everywhere inside. I especially like the ambient lighting. Controls and switches feel great, better than most imports I've driven. Performance is surprisingly good given the fuel economy. The suspension is a bit soft but ride is great. The engine is as refined as any 4 cylinder I've driven. The Malibu feels more like a luxury car than a family sedan.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quietness, especially interior sound insulation and engine refinement. Sound quality and features of stereo system (XM, MP3 input jack, built-in bluetooth) 6 speed transmission with paddle shifting. Fuel economy (getting 33 MPG + on hwy)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was a die hard fan of Japanese cars. And after working at GM, my guilt took over and I bought this car. It's been a month, and I drove about 1500 miles on the car, and I don't regret my decision. The car runs real smooth on the freeway with minimal noise. It has a feel of luxury sedans inside - quite roomy. If flying on the freeway is not what you intend, you won't regret owning this car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride. It is real smooth. I get about 27 to 28 mpg (combined). Night light focused on the drive stick was a great idea - you know exactly what your car will do when you press that gas pedal. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We leased the all new 2009 Malibu. I have nothing but praise for GM for delivering this vehicle. The interiors are so nicely done and the car so silent on the highway that you feel like you are in a luxury sedan. The 4 cyclinder engine has ample power for interstate passing and gives excellent gas mileage. We averaged 33 on the highway and 26 in the city. Priced at just around 20K Malibu is an excellent choice for those bored with Japanese cars. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased this vehicle about a month ago and now have 1300 miles on the odometer. Fuel economy in combined city/highway driving has so far been below expectations at about 24 MPG. - the same as on my 6-cylinder BMW which is much more powerful. The car handles well and is very quiet. The black suede cloth interior is attractive and comfortable. The faux wood trim is tastefully done and understated. The dashboard controls are easy to use but I would have preferred to have the trip computer information made accessable and cleared by pushing and holding in the headlight stalk instead of looking for the right buttons to push.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6-speed automatic transmission. Good that GM finally replaced their outmoded and less efficient 4-speed. This new transmission is smooth and always seems to know the right gear. Confidently merging and getting up to speed on a freeway ramp with the 4- cylinder/6- speed powertrain is easy and safe.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 6 speed 2.4L v4 is definitely the way to go. It has great fuel economy and is built as good as a BMW in my opinion. It is great to see that you do not need the v6 (which I had in my last car) to get the quiet ride and good acceleration. I was looking for a good family 4-door sedan that would also be fun to drive back and forth on my long commute to work (on the congested roads of NJ). Based on my budget of 20-25K, I had considered many new cars and also a low mileage BMW used car. After test driving, the Malibu was the clear winner. My wife and I were actually shocked at how smooth and quiet the ride was (though tried to keep the smiles off our faces before negotiating the price).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very smooth quiet ride. Great power in a small fuel efficient engine. Interior is really sharp (like a luxury car) and comfortable (despite me being 6'6"). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased a Camry last year for my wife because I thought they were supposed to be reliable. Well the warranty was over in one year for us because we drive alot, then we had the interior panels falling apart and the thrash engine noises and slow downshifts. Since the reliability rumors obviously wernt true, we decided to go with the facts and choose GM because they had a warranty to back it, and we couldnt have made a better choice. The interior is gorgeous and very sturdy and soft feeling. The 4 cylinder is so smooth that at 70 you can hardly hear it. Our black one with factory 19's looks very cool and you really stand out. Its a sharp contrast to the very common and boring camry we had.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did a lot of shopping around before purchasing my 09 Chevy Malibu. I have to say I fell in love with this car from the time I got behind the wheel. This car is by far the best in value and performance of other leading vehicles. I have the 2.4L4cyl and I am getting about 28 mpg on an average highway drive. It has enough horepower for me to take control of the highway driving. Love the new design of the Malibu, I have been asked by several people if the car was a BMW. This car has a European luxury style to it and looks sharp. The interior is very roomy and designed for comfort. You want options, this car has them. Love the free OnStar and the discount from the insurance company. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style, fuel economy, comfort, quiet, OnStar. Roomy, 5 star crash rating. Child friendly vehicle, carseat attachments everywhere, built in sunshade, hard plastic on seatbacks, (foor little feet) airbags to protect all around. A car I feel safe and comfortable driving in. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my red Malibu LTZ V6 almost 2 weeks and I absolutely love it. It looks like a million bucks - everywhere I go people ask me, "What kind of car is that? It's so pretty!" It drives like a 4 door sports car and handles like a dream. So far it is getting 30-31 mpg on the hwy and 18-22 in the city. It seems to get a higher avg mpg as I get a few more miles on it. The OnStar nav is great as I have no sense of direction. The seats are beautiful and comfortable and the trunk is roomy enough for a trip for 4 for a few days in N.O. The elec plug in the back is awesome. Everyday I find more to love about this car! I feel like a celebrity when I drive it because everybody stares at it</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar navigation; electrical plug in backseat; blue ambient lighting for nighttime driving; sound system/XM radio; great gas mileage; remote start; just the overall beauty of the car itself! It's hard to narrow it down to just a few things.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What's not to like about the car. It has great looks, great interior, and great on gas. This is the first car we have owned in years (Its been all SUV's for 10 years) and we love it. Nice features on the LT2. Love the dash and blue accent lights. The only down side is that after only 2 days, we had all 4 rims stolen of the vehicle! So we had wheel locks and a "tilt" sensor added to the factory alarm.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We had a 2007 GM with a V6 so we were a little worried the 4 cyliner would not have enough power. To our surprise the 4 coupled with the 6 speed automatic has enough power but is also very quiet. The downshifts are subtle. Car runs 70 to 75 easily, gets excellent gas mileage getting 25 average with mostly intown so far and its only got 450 miles on it. I think when on a trip car will easily get in the mid 30 MPG range after full break in. Car is very comfortable </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior in the LT2 is better than many higher priced cars that we looked at. The steering wheel controls for radio, cruise and some OnStar functions are great. Also like cargo nets on sides of trunk instead of across the back</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I tested the Altima, Camry, Accord, Mazda 6, Sonata and Ford Fusion before deciding this car was the winner. Each car had its strengths and weaknesses with options and price, but for overall solid feeling ride quality, and value the Malibu beat them all, in our opinion. I had the opportunity to drive a 2008 LS rental for several months for work and thought it was great. Testing the 2009 LTZ with 6 speed transmission seemed like a different and much nicer car altogether! The interior is roomy and the cocoa/cashmere leather with wood accents is very attractive. The interior LED lighting is very soothing at night. Had strangers tell us how beautiful the car is/ask questions.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 4 cyl engine is not race car ready, but it is smooth and quiet, and merge ready. The difference between the 6 speed trans and the 4 speed is night and day! The remote start is a great factory feature, as is the auto climate control. Overall, the styling, inside and out is my favorite feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned this for about 4 months and am very happy. Smooth/quiet ride, good gas mileage, good price. I got this after leasing a 07 Cadi CTS. I think the ride is just as good. If you drive between 55-60, I seem to easily exceed the 33mpg on the car sticker for highway miles. No complaints about the car, and really glad i made the purchase (and really glad this is an AMERICAN Car)!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Malibu was the perfect choice for me. Quiet 4cyl., smooth ride,and love the electric steering (seems more precise to me). This car is heavier perhaps that explains why it feels more solid than it's competitors. I prefer the four speed Auto (two less gears to worry about)this car shifts smooth and lack of road noise is delightful. All new car buyer reviews are generally good I hope I still feel this positive about my choice after 30,000 miles but that would apply to any choice you would make.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth quiet 4cyl., great stereo, satellite radio, onstar for 1 yr, smooth stable ride, well thought out dash with user friendly controls, traction control...like it all and this is just the LS model !!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought this car with trading in our Minivan cash for clunkers. The back seat fits our Britex carseat very well with plenty of leg room for our son. I like the controls easy to reach. The radio has 6 memories with 6 stations each which can be changed on the steering wheel. The remote start is great and easy to use with locking the keypad twice (turns on the alarm) & then pushing the remote start. The back seats fold down. We got a cargo net & mat package. The nets are great to keep items from rolling around. The driver seat has power seating.I was worried about the pick up and go and it does have this. Great rebates for 2009 models. For only owning it for less than 24hrs it is Great! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The leg room for the back seat passengers. There are several compartments through out the car. The pick up and go for a 4cyl 6spd. The radio with so many preset stations & the controls on the steering wheel. The auto lights they come on when needed as well as the rear lights. The door handle lights up</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It is very quiet and comfortable. The interior is top-notch. The ambient lighting is just right. Gas mileage is good, I can get 34 highway, 24 city. The stereo sounds great, great channel separation. I keep hearing bad things about the trunk... the opening is smaller than most, but is large. I fit two adult bikes in the trunk, when I folded the seats down! I don't have to use a bike rack:) If you are thinking of a Camry, or Accord, take a look at this one, because it is indeed quieter than those. The build quality is excellent. The gaps in the body panels are minimal and consistent. The paint job is perfect, with not too much orange-peel, like I've seen on the camry and accord.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The model we bought is not as indicated since the drop down menu did not let me select the V6 LTZ. We bought this Malibu with all of the options available including even the extra cost Red Jewel Tint paint that has a nice subdued gold metal flake built into the paint color. This is one very classy and upscale looking car especially with the two tone (mocha w/cashmere)leather interior. The car has gotten many compliments especially once people have ridden in it. It is very quick for a family sedan and the V6 seems to always be loafing unless pushed. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar, 110V rear seat port, feeling of very solid build and especially with doors that close with that distinctive bank vault sound. Quiet, smooth w/firm ride not the mushy ride I experienced on a comparably equipped Camry. Seats provide good support without the hard feeling of the Accord.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I replaced an old Jeep Cherokee with the Malibu because I needed something with more room and much better gas mileage. I don't regret it for a minute. It drives so much better than the Honda Accord and Hyundai Sonatas that I test drove. The interior is vault-like quiet, the 2.4 with the 6 speed transmission has plenty of power. The quality feel of the switch gear is first rate! I've been getting 22 mpg in town and between 31-35 on the highway depending on conditions and speed. So what's not to like? I love the looks of this car (LT1), but when I bought this, there was no aluminum wheel option. I understand there is now. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Excellent Car. Rides and handles well. Fuel economy exceeds EPA estimates. It gets an honest 36 mpg on the open road and has an overall average (50/50 city/highway) of 29.5. It is exceedingly quiet from both road and wind noise. Minor gripes are: trunk opening size and no seat height adjustment on passenger seat. Prospective buyers for Camrys and Accords are well advised to drive the Malibu. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the LS1 version but if I had to do it again (and had more money to spend!) I would buy the 6 speed. The 4 speed is adequate but I think the 6 speed might be peppier. Carefully check your fit and finish. I've discovered that my passenger door isn't properly aligned and that my folding rear seats don't latch properly. All in all it's a pretty smooth riding car and adequate for the usual day to day driving. I wouldn't want to take it on an extended journey though. Maybe the LTX model is more comfy?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>There's really nothing that jumps out on this car. It does have smooth body lines though. If you price Nissan Altima, or a Toyota you will probably buy the Chevy I got my 2009 for $19750 out the door. They wanted 34k for the Altima! I think it's a solid value and has a good track record.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is very deceiving. You might read great reviews on this car, but in reality I own this car and I would take back the purchase in a second. I understand where the "Great" reviews come from, but after owning this car after 4 months, it breaks down so quickly. My friend also owns this car and he told me his front console is vert lose and shakey and that his front seat ripped. The SAME exact thing happened to me and my mother. We are also are not happy with the leather/suede in this car. The suede wears down so quickly and stains very easily. The audio system loses its frequency often causing way too often static and loss of the channel. There is an up to this car, the trunk is big!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am absolutely thrilled with this car inside and outside! The first thing I noticed was how nicely finished the car is from the outside and how quiet it is on the inside. Having grown up with Corvette's, I opted for the V6 engine, which is plenty of power. Actually, my previous car had 200 horsepower and this is 252. I owned 1997 and 2004 Monte Carlo's and put 100,000 on each without requiring repairs prior to turning them in. Chevy certainly did their homework with this car! It's first rate! My father owns a DTS and always buys Cadillacs, but he thinks this car is fantastic as well. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like how quiet the car is on the road. I like the way it handles. The central console is very well thought out. There are cupholders both in the console and in the doors. It is my first car with a sunroof and that's becoming my favorite feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My early impressions of our 09 Malibu is very, very positive. Not only does the 4 cylinder do a good job at pulling this car, it gets very good gas mileage (26 city and 35 highway). Yes there are a couple of "blind spots", however, they're not severe enough to detract from the overall look, inside and out. Plus, the dealership I bought from came up with an aftermarket "SS KIT" and installed it on our car. The kit includes ground effects all the way around, a non working 2nd tailpipe with chrome tip, rear deck spoiler, extra dark tinted windows, and the all important (SS emblem on both front doors and on the trunk. These few cosmetic additions makes it look like a european sports sedan. WOW!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Radio system (local and XM), onstar, the placement of all controls at your fingertips plus the great visibility you have of the dash. And it's hard to believe that 6 speed transmission shifts at effortlessly as it does, but, it is sooooo smooth.</FAVORITE>

The exterior looks are great. Most people are surprised it is a Chevy. The handling and acceleration are good (I got the 6-cyl. LTZ). Gas mileage for my mostly town-driving is 22-23. We got 28-30 on a recent short trip, however, with the A/C on! The interior is comfortable, but I do not like the plastic door panels. Love the On- Star, XM, Blue-tooth and information center.

<TEXT>I'm a long-time BMW driver who bought a Malibu as a second vehicle and I actually love driving this car. I'm very happy with the quality, performance, comfort, and features. For the price of a base model 4-cyl 176 hp Accord, this Malibu (after multiple rebates and incentives) has V-6, satellite, 18" wheels, OnStar, bluetooth, and an excellent stereo. An enthusiastic endorsement from a BMW driver (I'm driving my 12th BMW) should count for something. GM has proven that they can make excellent cars, now they just have to figure out how to make money on those cars.</TEXT>

There wasn't anything special about the Camry and the Mazda 6 didn't handle very well so it eventually came down to the last three and overall I preferred the Malibu over the others. The ride is just as smooth and quiet as the other two, so if you can live without the silly little extras the Malibu is the way to go. You definitely get the most value for your dollar. </TEXT>

Having driven all of the Malibu's competitors, I thought this car would be Chevy's big score. Then the small disappointments set in. From my perspective, the one thing I can't live with is the front entry and egress. The stylists clearly won the battle here. Exiting the car makes me feel like I'm in an Italian sports car. Nice interior, well laid out, well-equipped. Trunk opening narrow, but spacious trunk. Still don't like the klunky 4 banger. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle deserves more attention, keeping in mind it has recently won in the family mid-size sedan competition. It's a real feat of American auto engineering. Just take all the controversy surround the GM company away and think of the vehicle as a piece of machinery. The design is outstanding, both external, and internal. The fit and finish is at par with many Japanese manufacturers. The cabin is accommodating and the drive is comfy and noise-free. The six-speed auto transmission is a marvel of engineering. In fact, GM went ahead and beat Toyota to it. Toyota followed with its own 6- speed soon after though.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy, drives on regular, silky-smooth 6- speed auto, very comfy and hush-hush quiet. Lovely American engineering. A car worth test driving!

I wanted a navigation system but it is not available. I am not disappointed as I love the OnStar nav system. The benefits of this GPS is that while driving I can have the route downloaded to my vehicle. With my other car with a navigation built in I have to stop the car and put in the info.

Importantly, there is a recall on AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION:LEVER AND LINKAGE:COLUMN SHIFT, for the Chevy Malibu and some other 2009 model vehicle. So if you own one of them, make sure you take them to your dealer for inspection. Would I recommend this car? I wouldn't! It's a decent car, has great exterior look. The interior look good too!

The overall fuel economy was just under 31 miles per gallon in spite of a couple hundred miles of country road driving at slow speeds, highway driving at 75 miles per hour (at times with the air conditioning on), and with one full tank of 10% ethanol. // Acceleration was both quick and sufficient when required. Handling was crisp and pleasant.

I love the toys- bluetooth, XM, remote start etc. Onstar O.K.(have had wrong directions). To sum, major safety flaw-if not for that I'd love it. Glad its a lease. Had to do again I'd go for 4 cyl.

Obviously in terms of a root cause, nothing has been repaired. So far, GM is unwilling to do anything outside the warranty process -- ie, keep taking it back for the dealer to throw parts at it -- unconscionable position. I am shredding my GM card.

I've owned Honda Accord, Prelude, Cadillac SRX and others. It has luxury, style, power, high fuel efficiency, it handles well, on and on. I would clearly purchase this over most of my other cars and would be hard pressed to select any other car. I highly recommend this car to anyone</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have done alot of research before I got this car. When Chevy brought out the new Malibu in 08', I knew I had to have one. I love my car, I got the 2lt with the engine package, so fuel economy is not that great, but it is so fun to drive. I plan on driving it to Arizona all the time from Vegas, it is so comfortable too, GM did a great job with this car. I bought it because it has done so well in the first year.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Even though I just purchased this car a few days ago I am totally amazed. I'm 58 yrs. Old and have had many new cars in my driving years. In the short time I've had it I have never felt about a car like this Malibu. It not only looks like a more expensive car it rides like one too. It's so comfortable and quiet. It has lots of extras as standard equipment. And geez, it's so quiet on the road. I actually call it my limo. Great job Chevrolet ! Oh yes, it gets great gas mileage too. I traded a 2005 corolla for this and on the average my average mileage for the corolla was 31-33 mpg. For the Malibu in similar driving I'm averaging with the 4 cylinder just over 27 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car just over a month ago. I absolutely love this car. I've been a Chevy fan a long time, but admit in 2005 I strayed and bought a new Honda because Chevy at that time didn't provide what I believed to be a quality product in a car. This car is absolutely one of the best handling, best looking, best built cars I've ever driven. I have the 2.4 cylinder, but the performance is as if a 6 cylinder is under the hood! It is so quiet, sometimes I can't believe it's running. I love the looks of the instrument cluster, very nostalgic. I love driving the car and have to literally pry it away from the wife to do so, since it's her car. I am glad I came back to Chevrolet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I took my Mom out for a new car, to replace her 2005 Accord V6. I provided insight and acted as a discussion partner for her thoughts. Mom absolutely loved the Malibu. She said it was way quieter than her 2005 Honda, which I had never even noticed having any wind noise. She also liked the simple layout of the controls in the Malibu vs. the Accord's complexity. When we took the Accord for a test drive you could instantly tell the improvement in the ride of the Malibu over the Accord. Accord was noisier at acceleration and the wind noise around the mirrors was horrible! She also stated that the Honda seats always felt like she was on a hard park bench but the Malibu felt comfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car September 30th and drove 5200 miles so far. A good friend bought the Honda EX-L and the Malibu interior is quieter. The onboard computer told me my right rear tire was low, 19 lbs, and when I got home and check it was exactly right. This is something the Honda does not offer as well. The competitors do offer 18 gallon tanks and perhaps a bit better MPG but not enough to trade the pros of this car in for. If I could do it all over I would have bought the Malibu in the 4 cylinder engine due to GM not increasing the gas tank size when increasing the engine size. This is a major oversite on GM's part, in my honest opinion.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car but they screwed up when they moved the manual shift to the steering wheel. You still have to put the shift stick in Manual before you can use the paddles. It would have been more convenient if they had left the ability manual shift on the shift lever like most other manufacturers. Another complaint is that GM changed suppliers for the built in garage door opener. The new units will not work on any door or gate installed within the last 10 years. My 2002 Envoy's unit worked fine on all my gates. My wife's only complaint is seeing out the rear window.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2LT V6, Black Granite Metallic. Traded '05 Impala for this car and owned a 2000 Malibu before that. Car is immensely more refined than either previous Chevy. My wife, long-time domestic car basher and Nissan owner, is impressed. New Malibu looks great in black with the 18" alloys. Interior is pleasantly refined at this price point. Front bucket seats are extremely comfortable - back seat, not so much. Most striking is the ultra quiet ride. Cabin is virtually silent at any speed. Suspension just right - hugs corners, yet very smooth. Powerful V6 - though gas pedal a bit touchy from dead stop. One complaint - "Premium" audio option a joke - $500 buys far better after market outfit. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We just love our 2009 Chevy Malibu! We were looking for a compact car to add to the household but after we test drove the Malibu we just fell in love with it and decided to go for it. We test drove Mazda and we have tried Honda but this American car surprised us. We are Asians and we've always had Japanese/Korean cars and with all the bad rep American cars are getting this model came as a surprise. Costs thousands less than a BMW, or a Mercedes, and definitely a better pick than a Nissan Altima, or Honda Accord. For very frugal people like us, we definitely recommend the Chevy Malibu, very classy and safe car for less money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a 2001 Chevy Malibu before this, got it used & absolutely hated it. Did some research into buying a Nissan Altima or Honda accord & every major review had exceptional things to say about the redesigned Mailbu. I fought the urge to check it out for months before I really compared it & stacked it up against the others. The interior & exterior design is amazing. Friends have said they can't believe they're in a Chevy, its extremely luxurious inside the LT2 model. Ride is smooth, extremely quiet interior, HUGE trunk & fold down back seats. Comes with tons of standard options not seen on other vehicles like Auto start, etc. I am EXTREMELY happy with this car, can't believe its a MALIBU!</TEXT>

<TEXT> First week problems with the brakes, noisy, spongy. Dealership didn't take the wheels off to look. 3 trips later finally heard the noise, next trip replaced the drums. Wheel alignment out on all 4 wheels. After fixing still pulls to the left. Found out there was a recall on brakes and a transmission problem. Was told to bring it in to fix the trans problem and they would look at the alignment again. When the trans problem was fixed - asked about the alignment. Was told we were making things up and escorted out of the building. Contacted gm in Detroit who sound interested but don't hold out much hope they will do anything.

<TEXT>I am a young married professional that just made my first "new" car purchase in Feb 2009, while upgrading from a small model car. I love this car. It is great to drive, its comfortable in the interior, everything is convenient to get to, the trunk seems huge, and I think the exterior design is amazing. This does not look like a Chevy. After owning a Honda Civic, I told myself I'd never buy a domestic car again, until they started building better quality. Well, the Malibu actually answered this maxim before I thought it would. The fuel economy is just okay, but that's also coming from someone that just got out of a '97 Civic that was still getting 31mpg. I 100% recommend the Malibu.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I downgraded to this car from a big luxury car, thinking it was time for something more economical and greener. I'm very happy, the car has all of the features as my other car and more, it drives very smoothly and handles very good. I'm amazed with the fuel economy, I haven't average less than 27 mpg, of course I drive mostly highway miles. A part from being smaller than my trade, its very comfortable inside with supportive seats and plenty of room for a car this size, the back seat is comfortable enough, assuming the front seats are not all the way back. So I can safely say I don't miss my old car, I do occasionally miss the power, but that's the compromise you have to make.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>LTZ V6</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I would consider myself a car man; this is the first US car I have purchased. I was attracted to GM's incentives and the relatively low priceof $22K for V6 with a trade incentive. Car is heavy and quiet. Seats are above average. Handling is a little heavy, but a serene ride prevails. Not really a sports sedan, but a refined cruiser with a firm, but Cadillac firm feel. Rear window is small and rear headrests block the view. Side mirrors provide good side/ rear vision to compensate. Engine is smooth and powerful, but a bit slow from 0-20mph. Then the car takes off. Be careful or you will really pay at the pump. I get 17mph in city (non stop-and-go traffic). Mixed hwy/c- 19mph.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Really decked out car with auto air, cruise, power seats, leather, onstar with navigation features. Radio is equipped with XM and 36 stations/ 6 CD changer. Power on ignition from remote. Homelink garage. Ride is smooth and quiet. Plenty of rear seat room. Trunk is large. Superb value for price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Checked out the Saturn Aura as well. I worked for Saturn for a year and had driven the 08 Aura very often, great car I knew it would be my next. Once 0% was offered almost across the board for GM it was down to the Aura XR 4cyl vs. the Malibu LT2. The one thing I can say from my experience driving this car is if you are looking into 4cyl the 6 speed is a must. The original 2008 4 cyl 4 speed was loud! Pitted local Saturn dealership vs. Chevy dealership and went with who had the better bottom line out the door pricing. I will admit I liked the subtle differences of the Malibu interior, especially the suede leather and leather around the shifter to make clean up easier.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Good car. I work at the dealership in which my wife bought it. Good car for someone who works there to buy one says a lot. I'm glad that chevy has upgraded these cars so much. Got the car for Employee pricing which was around $22,000. but it was the LT2 with black granite metallic, rear power package, titanium interior, premium sound and V6. Have to get the V6 it's not as noisy as the I4 and is really quick with 276HP. Good car considering one day it will be hard to fit the family in my Civic Si coupe. My Step dad who has only ever owned lexus says that this car is better than his RX330, he said it is a lot quieter and luxurious. Also thinking about getting one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Decided on the 2009 Malibu after looking at Camry, Accord, and Hyundai Genesis. This is the first Chevrolet we've owned since a 1954 Bel-Aire purchased in 1964. We've owned a Buick, Mercury, BMW, Acura, and several Ford trucks. This car was a replacement for a 2000 Chrysler 300M. My wife was skeptical about the 4 cyl. after driving the 300M for 8 years. She drove the 4 cyl. for a day and was impressed. I had voted for the fuel economy from the beginning. We are very satisfied with the car. We drive a car for 8-10 years primarily for local trips and put about 8k per year on it. However, with the price of gas decreasing---the 6 cyl. was tempting. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design. Quietness after driving a very noisy Chrysler 300M-- road noise was awful. The 6-speed automatic is great and the 18 inch wheels were a pleasant surprise when shopping for a car. About 2000 rpms at 65 mph. This is our first time for an XM radio and we are sold on it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Anyone who believes that GM can't build a quality, fun-to-drive car at a resonable price should try the new Malibu. I've had a lot of cars but nothing this good for the money. I had no intention of getting a Malibu until I test drove it (I was set to buy a Camry.) The Chevy won in ride and performance, and interior styling was way better than the Toyota. And the deal being offered made it thousand less. I know everyone talks about how the Camry delivers more on resale, but you're paying way too much up front. And the Malibu is way more fun to drive. If you're on the fence about buying a mid-size car, do yourself a favor an drive the Malibu.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After much research and model shopping I finally made it into my local Chevy dealer. I took the Malibu 4 cylinder for a test drive and really liked it, until I took the 6 cylinder for a test drive. Wow! What a smooth ride. Very comfortable and tight. The car handled our pot-holes very nicely during the test drive. The ride was supple and controlled and the noise level was very very low. The car handled like a vehicle that should cost much more. Nicely appointed and fun to drive. I touch the gas and I go! No lag in the 6 cylinder. The 4 cylinder was a little laggy for me. After my test drive, I wanted the 6 cylinder. My Prius was boring and low powered and I couldn't wait to trade it in.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar, the car has it's own phone number, XM radio, and an automatic starter which is a plus in our snowy state. The exterior is pleasant and the trunk is almost too big.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My XM radio is not receiving a signal, the malibu is in the shop for three days to fix - I have 1200 miles on the car, not happy. The lastest is they may have to replace radio - more time in the shop. The four cylinder, six speed automatic transmission is great. I like the car - even with the radio issue. Hard to believe but I would strongly recommend this Chevy to all. I test drove many cars - this car is as good, I believe better than: Honda, Nissan, Toyota, Mazda and etc. I wanted to buy American and thought I might have to accept less - the Malibu is a great car - really. The gas mileage is excellent for the car's size and weight. All will like the mpg - very quiet. GM lives!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked at Ford Fusion, Hyundai Sonata, and Volkswagen Passat. For the money, this was the best car. More than adequate power for a 4 cyl., extremely quiet at highway speeds, and a very smooth, comfortable ride. Suspension not too hard or soft, just right. Plenty of technology and luxury like comforts in the car (Bluetooth, OnStar, heated seats). First road trip was over 600 miles, averaged about 30-32 mpg, but I tend to drive a little fast. Car was at 80 mph, tachometer wasn't even at 2500. Putting a 6 speed trans in this car was the smartest thing GM ever did. Oh, did I mention, car is just beautiful to look at. This is my first American purchase, and I am extremely impressed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hands free bluetooth, OnStar nav, heated seats, TAPshift transmission, dual leather interior, ambient lighting.</FAVORITE>
