<TEXT>I'm 6ft 4in, with a 34 inch waist -- not that big, but I find the driver's seat very uncomfortable. It's too small and the outside ridges are too hard. I've driven older Honda Pilots and liked them, which is one reason we bought a new one. Don't know what they changed, but it was not for the better. My wife has no problem, but if you're my size, or larger, beware. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased in Jan 09 after much looking and reading. I read so many complaints about the styling that I almost did not buy it. I traded a Landcruiser because I was looking for something with better gas mileage, and economy. I love my Pilot. Once you are in the car, you forget about the boxy style. I am getting twice the gas mileage as in my previous car. It is a safe, fun , reliable car to drive. I bought the 4wd for traveling off road later. I plan to keep my Pilot for many years. Service has been very good.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seat comfort, mileage, switching to 3 cyl, room for storage, handles well on the road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just returned from a 3500 mile trip. At real world Interstate speeds (75-76 mph) I was able to squeeze out 21.5 mpg. A bit low but this is a big box! Suspension is a bit too stiff and with a truck type tire and stiffer steering than our previous two vehicles ('07 Pacifica & '02 Highlander) you never feel like you're 'part of the vehicle'. Bucket seats are firm but comfortable. Plenty of cubby holes and storage compartments but interior trim materials are hard to the touch and unattractive. Sound system is just 'OK'. '02 Highlander sound system has better features. Glad we leased. Engine Mgmt. system works well. No discernible sensation when system shuts down or turns on cylinders. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my '09 pilot, touring, 4WD since May 2009 now. We love the interior space with 8 seats. We do not like the plastic on dash board and the whitish center console backing. The Handling can use a lot of work but it's a Honda, I guess they think that I will be spending another $20k to make it look/feel like a BMW anyways so why bother. :-) I really did not think that their EPA mileage will be that much off. It says 16/20/18 (city/highway/combined avg), but I am getting just about 250 miles for a full tank of gas, that's about 12/MPG. WOW!!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Pilot about 7 months now and have had it on a 3000 mile trip to Colorado and back (I live in California). The Pilot has plenty of power even in the mountains I averaged 23.4 mpg on that trip even with the cruise set at 75mph (which is the legal speed limit in Nevada, Utah and Colorado on the Freeways). I did take it out of cruise when climbing long grades the transmission shifts too much if left in cruise....I was driving 12 hour days and did not get tired at all the Pilot is very comfortable....even around town I get little better than 15 mpg. It does drift to the right if you take your hands off the wheel. But most 4WD's I have driven do the same thing. I'm very happy with my Pilot.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I do like the mpg feature on the odometer, the rear A/C outlets are a nice feature also.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looked at the Toyota Highlander and Mazda CX-9, which simply did not stand up to the size and features of the 2009 remodeled Pilot. Bought the Pilot in September of 2008, and have been very happy so far with no problems. Towed a tent camper trailer without any problems -- hardly knew the trailer was behind us -- did not have any issues with sway.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very smooth driving with good visibility over the hood. Enjoy the hands-free bluetooth feature -- the clarity on phone calls is superb. Also enjoy the dual front zone climate control. Love the dash-mounted shifter which frees up storage room between the front seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We looked around very hard before buying our Pilot and we believe that we got the best for our money. Sure there are other SUV that are better in some areas but the Pilot got our vote because overall it had the most for the money. It stops very fast if you are driving at high speed. It rides smooth compare to others. It is roomier than others and it carries a lot more than what the brochure says, trust me we have tried. Fuel consumption is better than what the brochure says. It does get 25mpg on the highway and fully loaded with 5 people it still gets 24mpg. We just love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>3rd row seat has a lots of room. Rearview camera and the ability to pull our 20 foot boat without a problem. By the way that gas mileage is still 17mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Before buying this, I did long test drives of Toyota Highlander and Pilot back to back. Although the Highlander has better looks, pickup and performance, the steering response was non-existent, it was like playing a video game. Also, the space after the last row on the Highlander was minimal, and the last row did not have a split seat. Pilot on the other hand did not have great pickup, but once you get to the highway speeds, it performed remarkably well. The ride quality and steering response were excellent. The utility factor is awesome, with 110v outlet, ipod link etc. Also, I sat much more comfortably and had a better view of the road than the Highlander. Overall a great family SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride quality, rear camera, Rear Entertainment System, steering response, climatic control and the Eco Drive feature, where the Pilot can run on a lower number of cylinders when all 6 are not required. The enhanced frame containing lot more steel to improve safety.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've been happy with our Pilot. We're hooked on the XM radio, love the dual zone climate controls and are very impressed with the overall room of the interior. We were looking forward to having the class 3 trailer hitch, but were sorely disappointed with the fact that just the Honda trailer wire harness is $181 dollars for a 2 foot harness under the bumper(?!). Even more disappointed that the connector under the bumper is a goofy connector that NOBODY carries yet. Happy over all though. We'll just wait to buy a harness from someone not trying to rip off a customer for an overpriced set of wires. Happy with the handling, but our Pilot pulls to the right on level ground at constant speed</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the XM radio and sound system. Interior space with the rear seats folded down is great. Love the dual zone climate controls in the front and the separate climate control for the rear passengers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This was my first SUV and I love it! I've always owned sports cars, so it as a bit tough to choose which SUV was practical. It was a decision between the Ford Edge or the Pilot. After test driving the Pilot, I took it home the same night. Within days i was getting acquainted quite well with my Pilot. The interior is very roomy, perfect especially when you have kids or to jam a bunch of your friends for a weekend getaway. Not too happy with the mileage but expected for an SUV. I've already taken my pilot to the nation's capital from NJ for a break in. It was smooth riding all the way down even with icy and hazardous road conditions on I95. Overall this vehicle is safe and reliable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded in my 2006 Pilot for the 2009 because I could not find a 2008 SE in my area. That being said, I read all of the reviews and was quite hesitant, but so far I am pleasantly surprised and happy with the vehicle. It is definitely geared more toward its competitors of the Pathfinder and 4Runner in that it drives much more like a truck which will be a disappointment for anyone looking for the new Pilot to be exactly like the old. With that being said, its overall functionality is much more than the previous models in that it is much more spacious, heavy duty and an "all around" family vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Storage, Storage, Storage. 2nd and 3rd row seats are much more comfortable and spacious even with child carseats. I found the radio controls much easier to reach being petite woman. The ability to set the driver and passenger temps individually a plus. Love rear hatch window. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After two road trips and a full tank of gas, I'm very happy. With 3-4 adults and 2 kids, the car accelerates well for the type of car it is, and has some good climbing power. Very smooth and very quiet. As far as cylinders shutting off, you can feel it only if you're really paying attention and looking for it - otherwise pretty seamless. After a few test drives as well as an additional 300 miles in, I'd say the braking feels as responsive as you need it to be - smooth when you need a gradual stop, and firm when you need to shed speed quickly. I feel very safe and comfortable in this car, yet it's a great pleasure to drive. Compares favorably against the Lambdas (Acadia, Outlook, etc).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the space in the interior especially the 3rd row; plus you can fit two full car seats in the middle row plus an adult. Latch hookups across the center row and one in the 3rd row (which I love). Very roomy and comfortable. Smooth and quiet as well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle has power, and a beautiful, smooth ride. I drove fords for years, and find this vehicle to be exceptional in quality, ride, and feel. The Pilot has a wider wheel base than my Explorer, and rides deep into a turn so you remain seated at normal speeds. I get very little if any pitch, and roll from the suspension. The car is very stable. Lots of interior space as well. The looks of the car are not great, but that is the only part I would want improved. I STRONGLY recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cubby-holes and storage areas. Plenty of powerports for MP3 and XM radio. Doors open wide, engine is powerful. Pick-up when merging on freeway is excellent! Plenty of power on hills. Compared to my former V8, this vehicle has some serious power, with better gas mileage. ECO mode is great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the first Honda I have owned. I have a wife, soon will have 3 kids, a dog, and a boat that we need to pull. Looked at everything that seated more than 5 people, had decent fuel economy, and could pull a reasonable sized boat. Honda was last on my list to look at but when we did we ended up buying it. So far we really like it. We get about 17 mpg city and as much as 21 mpg on the highway. Lots of room in the inside, good storage, comfortable. We are impressed. The closest competitor would be a Toyota Highlander and it doesn't hold a candle to the Pilot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My family & I are really enjoying our Pilot. It's much better than my 06 Frontier crewcab! It's true that the interior materials are not as upscale as other Honda vehicles (compared to my wife's 07 CR-V or a new Accord), but it's not offensive at all & I like it just fine. Braking has been great for me in real-world conditions. Power has never been a problem; I pass & merge with ease. Sprung for the DVD & our daughter loves it. Seats are very comfortable. Cylinder shutoff is noticeable & takes some getting used to. Road noise is minimal. Wonderful little details included in the design, such as the grocery hooks, cargo net, hill assist. Sound system is clear/crisp, but not as good as expected.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The fuel economy is a farce plain and simple. We have had the car for 1500 miles and have not averaged over 14.5 mpg. Not to mention that you can?t drive this vehicle over 75 as the body roll is unsafe. Other items to be aware of, the cargo area slope is a really bad idea. The remote locking system must be unlocked again to open hatch and can't click to lock if any door is still open. The lack of adjustment in the passenger?s seat as well as heat only on the seat not the back of the passenger seat. Not the easiest to get into the 3rd row. The noise at highway speed. Park sensors that aren?t on the front of the front bumper so you could pull into something straight on without warning. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Relative to other vehicles we test drove, we simply found the Pilot a cut above anything else out there for the money we had budgeted. This vehicle replaces a 2002 CRV, so it's obvious an upgrade. Feature-wise, we're quiet happy with it. We looked seriously at Saturn Outlook, 2006 Pilot, and Toyota Highlander. Outlook, from a driver's view, just didn't feel right. Highlander felt pretty decent, but didn't care for fit for passengers in 3rd row. 2006 Pilot felt great from a driving standpoint, but felt like it had less leg room in 2nd row than our CRV. After two test drives on the 09 Pilot and there was little doubt. This was a smart pick. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We set out to buy a Saturn Outlook but after test driving all the competitors, took a look at the 2009 Pilot just to rule it out. Immediately we had to have it. Don't know what the fuss is with the styling, we like it from every angle. We have the Mocha Metallic ext. with beige leather and think it is a very classy combination. I love the drivetrain. With concentration I can feel the VCM but it is very imperceptible. Ride is very smooth without being floaty. Handles great. Very solid feeling, doors slam shut like a Mercedes. Awesome seats and features for the money. Would not mind another couple mpg but easy on gas for a lg. vehicle. Love the dual exhaust looks and sound. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power and handling very good for such a large vehicle. Very big and usable interior. Quiet, except when 512 watt stereo being exercised. Good looking exterior. I dare you to find a similar vehicle with more bang for the buck. Rock solid vehicle. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This 2009 Honda Pilot has been a real disappointment. With approx. 5200 miles since new in August 2008 we are not pleased with the over all quality. At less than 1000 miles the rear windshield wiper assembly flew off when I turned it on. The battery has died twice while parked with everything off. This happened at approx 3200 miles and just this week with 5000 miles. The side trim panel on the drivers side door next to the window fell off. The entire vehicle rattles and squeaks as if there were 105,000 miles on it (Our 02 SAAB & 03 VW are quiet!) The right front passenger seat is jerky when you use the forward-back adjustment. The shift lever make operating or tuning the radio uncomfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle has been great and I have recommended it to friends. The tire pressure, fuel and service notices are very helpful. This car is smart and takes the headache away from the driver. The turn radius is impressive. This car is smooth to drive and the entertainment including speakers and listening to music makes travel fun from taking kids to practice to driving coworkers at lunch. Reliable, easy to drive and park and looks and feels like a luxury vehicle. The new grille looks good. I also have the leather seats that are heated which I think not only look good but are also comfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife wanted an SUV this time around since we drive in various weather conditions. Love the Pilot so far. It's surprisingly roomy and the features are outstanding. We had looked at most SUVs on the market and chose this one. We've had it 1 month now and I'm watching to see what the mpg will be. Got 20.5 avg on our first 500 mile trip at 73 mph. Like to see a little better but I'll give it time to break in. Still have to read the book occasionally to figure things out.</TEXT>

I was surprised at the size of it when I pulled it into the garage. This vehicle is huge, in a good way. The 8 person seating capability is great. Bluetooth phone is great for my wife who can't drive & hold a phone at the same time. The navigation unit far surpasses the portable one I just bought.

<TEXT>I purchased the car in Aug 08. and was extremely happy with the car until two days later. I noticed that the steering would pull to the right. I was told it was the crown in the road. Having insisted on something being done, a number of adjustments were made and it drives better. The next issue which has me pondering trading the car in,is noise heard from the gas tank. When the gas tank is full, I can hear the gas sloshing around and it makes a loud thumping noise. The dealership stated this was due to the design of the gas tank and a condition of the car. Take the opportunity to turn off your radio and drive around. Otherwise, it has great space, and a comfortable ride. Gas mileage is ok. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Some of this is about purchase experience, but there are a few issues with the vehicle. Mileage - count on getting a full 1/3 less than promised. Driving as gently and efficiently as I can, I can't get over 12.4. Nimbleness - it has decent turn radius and good handling on the road, but is really over sized in parking, both getting into spaces and opening doors when parked. Stupid remote locking system - must unlock again to open hatch and can't click to lock if any door open. Maybe configurable, but haven't figured out. Finally, watch out for Honda Leasing. Closed with $0.15 per excess mile on 3 year, then called back in to sign new contract at $0.20. Wouldn't have leased at that rate.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Thought I would contribute a review to try to assist others with the agonizing decision I made - one that I am very happy I made: to go with a 2009 Honda Pilot 4wd Touring over the Highlander, Xterra and Pathfinder, and CX-9. Many object to the looks of the Pilot - we like it lot; looks like a real SUV. This vehicle is the clear choice for those looking for the utmost utility, safety, modern conveniences, and medium- duty off-road capability (yes, that is what the Pilot's chassis, unibody structural integrity, and suspension are designed for), reasonable fuel efficiency, and highly functional (hopefully reliable) 4WD system. Pilot=best value/content going for the $$$ - mighty beefy S/CUV!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Best off-road capabilities of any CUV (true medium duty); nice ride and good handling on road; cylinder management for fuel conservation; all the tech goodies that came in my Touring trim; great looking interior (mine is black leather int./black exterior) and comfortable front seats; storage/cargo</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After testing several mid-sized utes traded in my 04 4-runner. I have owned Hondas in the past so expected the quality. What surprised me was how solid, and capable it feel's driving on rutted out, washboard dirt roads-a big plus for an avid kayaker/mtn. biker/all around outdoor enthusiast in western Montana. On road handling was good enough, but much improved with a set of aftermarket 18 in wheels and upgraded tires, and still rides smooth on and off road! Factory side steps and rack help break up a somewhat frumpy design, and along with the aftermarket wheels gives the pilot a much sportier demeanor. I'm really impressed with the quality, technology, and overall driving dynamic's.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the vtm-4 lock for the all wheel drive. Nice stereo, and high tech, yet user friendly dash design. Cavernous space with seats folded flat for all my outdoor gear. Friend's love second row seating space and comfort. Three zone climate control works well. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my '03 EX-L Pilot for a new '09 EX-L model. The '03 was very dependable. In comparison, the '09 has a much smoother & more quiet ride. Road noise has been reduced dramatically. There are more standard options and features on the new model. I am having to get use to the VCM technology. There is noticeable hesitation when the vehicle changes cylinder rotation. Some reviews have given the Pilot bad marks on the lack of V6 power. This has not been an issue with me. The dash layout is well thought out with the button locations and instrument panel. The dash read-out message screen is pretty neat with clear and easy to read information. Visibility is good. Got 22 MPG on first road trip. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Dark Cherry color with beige leather is a gorgeous combination. XM radio, sunroof, large storage well in back.

<TEXT>Replaced a horrible GMC Safari with the Honda Pilot. Should have done it sooner. Took pilot on a 500 mile trip to Myrtle Beach and got 22+ MPG during break in. Fit, finish, reliability on ours has been perfect (1500 miles so far). Rides quiet and smooth--sometimes I think it has shut off sitting at a light. Mileage is as advertised, although the mileage readout feature on dash can teach you to be light-footed and bump the mileage up some (AWD gets close to 16 in stop and go commute and close to 23 mpg on I-95 with its occasional slowdowns). Turning radius makes it easy to handle. Seating comfort and room is 100% better in 2009 than 2008.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth ride, tight turning radius, easy reconfiguration of middle and rear seats, lots of space for snow skis, beach chairs, and other toys for vacations, and XM radio turned out to be better than I thought. Great on long trips. Steering wheel control of stereo is great for keeping eyes on the road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The steering on my brand new 2009 2WD Pilot was pulling to the right the first day off the lot. At first, I thought it was the road, but the pull was consistent on all road surfaces. After calling the dealer, I discovered that Honda did not redesign the springs for the all-new 2009 Pilot, and as a result, the alignment problems are becoming prevalent. Here's the problem: the 2009 models have more weight distribution in the front compared to 2008 models, and heavier springs should have been used. The dealer indicated they needed Honda approval to fix the problem. The fix consists of replacing the right front spring with a rear spring from a 2009 4WD model. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Was looking at the Highlander and was totally surprised by the great deal Honda was offering on these. Very comfortable and I love the room and cargo configurations. Cabin is slick. Heating controls are kind of an odd design, but you get used to it. I think the Highlander ride was smoother and more car like, but the Pilot takes bumps well enough. Very versatile. Road trips, tailgating, cargo hauling, towing (included!). Its great for just about anything. MPG is about as advertised, not great. So far so good. I'm very happy with my choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We compared to the other suvs this was clearly the best value and performance has been excellent. However, we strongly advise a longer than 30 minute test drive. At about 15 minute your back will start sweating. I had leather seats in every car since 1980, and never have we sweat so much! I cringe at the thought of driving anywhere over 20 minutes. Add to the cost of reupholstering and the value drops significantly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I debated between purchasing a Highlander and the Pilot and I am glad I chose the Pilot. The Pilot comes standard with a trailer hitch and a comparably equipped Highlander is about $3-$4K more and Toyota charges $600 over and above for a hitch. The Pilot is smooth in it's acceleration and ride. The interior design is extremely well thought out and has tons of storage. The new design is much beefier/heavier/more masculine looking, which I love. You get a lot of great features for your money with this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Honda Pilot, I liked my 2005 even though I thought the styling was blah. I get all the equipment I can get on my vehicles and the only thing I left off this one was the rear entertainment and AWD, neither of which I need or want. This Pilot is fantastic...I'm getting 20 mpg in town and 26 on the highway (I'm a grandmother that doesn't "hot-rod"). It's luxurious and that's what I was looking for. I do agree that the glove compartment is stingy with room, but it's a minor flaw. The Navi drives me nuts, but I'll get used to it. Can't learn to trust the back-up camera, still need to look first. Thanks Honda, you did it again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the vehicle! To christen the purchase, my wife and I and our three surviving, 80+-year-old parents left on a 700-mile round trip getaway. The five of us were amazed at how much comfort and privacy were afforded by the third row seating combined with the rear entertainment system. My mother (5?4?) sat in the third row the entire trip and concluded that the rearmost seat was just as comfortable as the second row. Gas mileage has been decent for a vehicle of this type: 22 mpg on the trip with 5 adults + luggage; 19 mpg mixed city/highway; 16 mpg city-only driving; 14.5 mpg city-only with poor driving habits.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great audio/video, including MP3 connectivity, satellite radio, and DVD. Rear camera is wonderful for keeping an eye on our dog as we back up. Smooth drive train, except as noted below.

<TEXT>We have owned our Touring Pilot since May. We drove to Maine with 3 teenagers and Mom and Dad. The trip went great! We attached a carrier on the back and had more than enough room for a 2 week trip. This is a user friendly car. The seats fold down so easily-only 1 person needed. For the long trip I found the space above the glove box helpful for gum, change, etc. Our teens love the wireless headsets - and the ability for us to hear XM - while they watched their DVD. The road handling was excellent- especially in a horrible rain storm. The rear wiper - starts out fast then goes into it's slow mode-very helpful. All in all -a very satisfied customer.

<AUTHOR>Loving Honda</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have been shopping for a new SUV for 6 months. Almost bought the Toyota 4Runner but decided on Honda Pilot because of 3rd row fold down seat. I love that it does not look like a crossover. The only negative is the 2nd row seats only recline a little. We are a family of 4 coming out of an Odyssey and we loved to be able to recline the 2nd row on long trips. I also like the door cup holders on our 07 CR-V and the 09 Pilot only has them for the 2nd row. There are 2 cup holders in the center console. I love the high tech & luxurious feel of the cockpit. The drivers seat feels very cushy and I love the lumbar support. My kids love the pop out remote control for the DVD. Averaging 17mpg city. </TEXT>

<TEXT>With a growing family we were in the market for a large crossover. Viewed all the typical competitors and the Honda was honestly last on our list. The deciding factor? We had one requirement that eliminated all of the other crossovers. We wanted to fit a rear facing infant seat, another car seat and an adult in the second row. The Honda was the only car that did it safely and comfortable. We are amazed that so few cars can do that other than the GMC Yukon which is much too large for city driving. So far the ride is fine. Fit and finish leave much to be desired. Already have one panel that doesn't fit right but I hope Honda can fix it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Second row space is great. Good choice if you don't want to banish people to the third row. Enough space behind the third row for baby equipment. Compliant drive. easy to drive on crowded Chicago streets. Loaded with features. Love the DVD player !</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>For the most part this vehicle is awesome. Some people have had an issue with the exterior, but I have had nothing but compliments on its looks. It's one tough truck for sure. The handling is excellent. Although, it took some getting used to the transmission that slows you down when you take your foot off the accelerator. The turning radius is unbelievable. The only thing troubling me right now is the gas mileage. I went from a 4-runner with a V8 to the Pilot thinking I would get better mpg with a 6cyl. So far thats not the case. I primarily drive in stop and go traffic. I am only getting about 13 mpg. I do run the A/C constantly, so that may have something to do with it. Otherwise, I love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded in my 2003 Pilot with 90,000 mile on it still going strong. I just wish the new pilot had similar if not same mileage per tank as old model. I was able to get close to 350 miles per tank (which was smaller) where as I only got 250 or less with new one (bigger tank). I do notice the new one drives more like a truck with more power. I have to agree with one of the review about the sloppy finished interior (under the driver seat has metal parts sticking out beyond the carpet). Overall, I do love my new Pilot and my kids love the XM radio and navigation. Not crazy about the bells and whistle but nice to have for those who might appreciated it.

<TEXT>After 15 years of mini vans, we finally have a ride I love to drive. We traded in our 06 Odyssey Touring. We test drove pretty much everything in this class with AWD and third row seating. We could not find another SUV in this price range that rode as nice with as much room. We also drove the 08 Pilot and there really was no comparison. The interior design improvements over the 08 probably sold us more than anything else. The additional room is what sold my wife, plus the driving comfort. I never wanted to drive her mini vans but she has trouble keeping me out of ?her? new Pilot. At 6?1?, I?m able to sit in the third row seat comfortably. After 500 miles, we're very happy and impressed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Honda has hit a home run with this. Don?t bother with an Acura MDX, save $10K and get the Honda Pilot with the same features. Ride is powerful and smooth, handles like a luxury vehicle, can carry a ton. Gets decent MPG for an SUV this size. We have the 4x4 and are averaging 18 driving in mostly mountain roads, only 2 mpg less than our Honda Odyssey. Doubt you can improve MPG without decreasing the power, maybe Honda can come up with a hybrid model someday like the Highlander? Couldn?t be happier though. We are military, family of 4, and have many moves left in our career, we need the space and ability to tow a trailer. Buy one ? and enjoy. Great job again Honda.</TEXT>

It has everything that we were looking for and more. We got the Touring with NAV and RES (more bang for our bucks) and LOVE all the features and xtra space it gives us. We need the space for family and camping trips, etc. The ride is really smooth and quite. I really feel we are safe in it (tons of safety features).

It cuts down on visibility and limits the access to cargo. I also wanted the window in the hatch to open individually. No other vehicle had this option. I had a minivan and really considered myself a SUV kinda girl. When I saw the new redesign for the Pilot, I got excited and decided to wait until it came out before purchasing the other eggs.

<TEXT>I bought my Pilot last winter to replace a Chevy diesel work truck and an aging Chrysler family van. The Pilot does double duty as a business vehicle that regularly tows a 5,000 pound utility trailer and a weekend family cruiser. Very impressed with how well it does both, and I'm very surprised to see the engine occasionally described as underpowered as I've experience nothing of the kind and am very impressed with both the towing ability and quickness from a stop, as well as the highway climbing torque. I'd suggest others try locking out the overdrive for most local driving/climbing if they want to see brisker performance. I have 13K trouble free miles to date and am averaging 18-19 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very Comfortable and spacious. Definitely the best SUV for a family, because you can fit 3 people in both the middle and back rows. The reason we bought this vehicle is because we have two kids in car seats and my wife wanted to be able to sit in the back with them. This is the only SUV we could find that has the LATCH system in the middle seat. So we can put the two car seats together, and my wife can sit on the end. The reason this is handy is so that if others needed to access the third row, you wouldn't have to remove a car seat. That would be a pain! The third row seat is also actually quite spacious for adults. Great family car. The only thing is that it's kinda boring to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The best thing about this car is that you can put child car seats in all three seats in the middle row, AND also one in back. Great for kids. Also love that you can fit 8 people. It's nice that it has 4 wheel drive. It's basically as handy as a minivan but the 4 wheel drive puts it over the top.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really wanted a GMC Acadia. Loved the look, but was a little scared with all the financial trouble. I also heard the GMC was not a reliable as a Honda. Therefore, trying to get the best buy for my money I bought a Honda Pilot. BIG MISTAKE. I have had major issues with the alignment. Feels like I go in ever other week. They (Honda Cars of Katy) keep telling me the Pilot was built to pull to the right. After spending 30K+ I thought I was getting a reliable car. Now after only 4 months of ownership, the paint is peeling in multiple places. The leather is already coming apart at the seams. I thought Honda was supposed to have quality vehicles, but I am sadly disappointed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second EX-l Pilot. I had a 2005 with 120K miles on it that my daughter is still driving. Except for tires and timing belt, I had no other issues with the 2005 and expect the same from the 2009. The 2009 seems quite a bit bigger both inside and outside. The third row is much better on the 09 and easier to use, although seldom use. Ride is fine,and so is road noise, it is a truck so will not be as quiet as a car. Fuel economy is 18-20 no matter what. I can't say I am thrilled with the variable ignition because at certain RPM's it seems to jerk like it can't make up its mind. I would not hesitate getting another Pilot.</TEXT>

Most all the accessories (dark wood trim all over, premium lighted side steps, all weather mats, chrome grill, front and back aluminum underside etc) were added.

All the controls on the dash are good except the A/C buttons. I love the backup camera. It makes life very easy (especially while parallel parking). Turning radius beats most cars including my 02 Maxima! RES comes with upgraded sound system which is also wonderful. Storage options in the cargo area are also good. Like the tire pressure monitoring too. The drawbacks are mileage (even with VCM), road noise and vibrations (only sometimes) due to VCM. Still waiting for first long drive. In city MPG - 16-18.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got this brand new 2009 Honda Pilot EX-4WD about a month ago. So far, my experience with this new Honda Pilot became kind of a nightmare. I found this car was built by cheap workmanship made in Canada (or USA whatever). The interior parts are not aligned precisely and some are falling apart after 7 days of purchase. I had to take back my car to the dealer twice to have them fix my dash board assembly, and there's still about 1/8" of gaps between the parts. Also, the front passenger seat developing strange noise if someone sits on it. This car ALSO started to developing engine noise. When I step on gas pedal, there's some kind of metal-clicking noise comes from the engine. Too many to list.</TEXT>

The Pilot came fully loaded and almost $6k cheaper than the Acadia. The Pilot has good pick up, lots of space, and a nice exterior. The middle row has plenty of room for my kids and the split 3rd row can stay down for storage or up for additional passengers. Pilot comes standard with 8 passenger seating. The rear DVD system comes with 2 wireless headphones. Touring edition comes with lots of standard features We love our Pilot and are sure to enjoy it for many years.

Also the dealership was far above Nissan and Toyota when it came to friendly and professional service. We bought the Black cherry w/ Black leather and the vehicle is just beautiful!!! It does pull to the right slightly so I'll be taking it back to get fixed. No big deal. </TEXT>

I added a woodgrain dash which gave it a very rich look. I also installed after market remote starter, alarm and keypad entry. I am quite satisfied after 7000 miles, but definitely needs better mileage. I live in the city of Boston so 90% of driving is city miles. Probably getting 13-14 mph city. The pickup could be a little better, but its adequate. I have a heavy foot. Overall I am happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This new Pilot not only looks great but it performs great too! We test drove other SUVs but the Pilot not only captured us with its looks but now that we have own the car for a month, we can say the performance is excellent too. Fuel economy for having the shut-off piston system is a bit disappointing but nevertheless, it is on par with the competition. We purchased the Touring w/nav and we couldn't be happier. Some say the road noise is a problem, but we did not find it to be that bad. I also read that the engine does not provide as much power but I actually think it has adequate power (unless you intend to pull a boat or something like that). Overall very satisfied and highly recommend it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We chose the Pilot over the Buick Enclave and traded in our Buick Ranier (which we had thoroughly enjoyed for almost 5 years). The Pilot has more than exceeded our expectations and, at this point, is the most enjoyable vehicle we have ever owned. Increased gas mileage over the Ranier is also a plus. The Pilot has the best-designed and most usable, roomy interior we have ever seen. Combine that with a striking exterior and fun-to-drive performance, then wrap it up in Honda dependability and you have a package that is hard to beat. Did I mention that the Pilot was $6000 less than the Enclave? We also own a Honda Ridgeline and love both of our Hondas!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We seriously considered several vehicles for 1-1/2 years before we made our purchase - the Highlander, Forerunner, Acadia, Enclave and the Outlook. Our main concern was a safe and comfortable vehicle to travel long distances and that got reasonable gas mileage for an SUV. The touring model ended up being our pick due to the Michelin tires. The sales people we encountered at all of the dealerships were not knowledgeable about the fact that there is a difference in the tires on the Touring and the EX and LX models. The Michelin tire on the Touring gave us a much quieter ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the navigation system which we didn't think we'd use. Also have enjoyed the comfort of the leather seats, hands free link, dual driver seat position recall and XM radio.

<TEXT>I strongly considered buying a GM product. Test drove the Pilot & I was sold. The deals Honda was offering were much better than GM. I have owned Hondas in the past and have been extremely satisfied with the reliability. The ride & acceleration are smooth. The seats are comfortable- front is roomy. Plenty of features- Honda put a lot of thought in this vehicle-mirror for viewing the backseats, MP3 jack, console with lots of room. Plenty of storage in the doors. Gas mileage is acceptable-could be better. I have zero complaints. One small drawback is the small cargo space if you are with more than 6 people in the car. However, we were able to take 7 people to the beach with room for our beach gear.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After purchasing a 2009 Honda ex-l pilot I realize that the pre-wiring connection was a dummy connection. I am not able to connect a trailer wiring harness unless I purchase the expensive kit from Honda. The kit cost more than if I had bought the tow hitch separate and had it wired. I also found out splicing into the wiring voids the warranty. Then I learned that remote start is a problem. Turning the car off after remote start just to enter the car is the dumbest idea I ever heard. It is my understanding both of these feature was pre-figure to get you to come back to Honda. I just wonder what else have Honda done to steer you back to them. My first Honda and my last. Bad mistake of Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I "traded up" to the 09 Honda Pilot Touring after driving a Honda CRV for 18 months. I had no complaints about my CRV other than I wanted that "luxury" feel and needed more room. I drove many vehicles in my search and decided on the Pilot because it drove the best and gave me exactly what I wanted for a lot less than the Acura MDX and I liked the interior better than the Highlander. The pilot is a dream to drive and although it won't win any races, it has plenty of power. Love at first drive for me. :) My gas mileage is in line with what others seem to be getting. In mixed driving, around 18 mpg. </TEXT>

<TEXT>For something with the aerodynamics of an apartment building, this thing is a nice ride. It's exceptionally quiet, even over marginal pavement or at higher speeds. Seats are extremely comfortable even after several hours of driving. Interior is very roomy - even the 3rd row. I had a 6-foot co-worker back there, and with the 2nd row shifted forward slightly, he said it was comfortable enough for a cross-town jaunt. Engine has a enough grunt to cruise very nicely at 90MPH. Ride is smooth with minimal body roll on turns. The build and design are typical Honda - everything's well laid out (overall), and controls and surfaces have a good tactile feel - some minor styling quibbles (IMHO.) </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Pilot since Sept 08. It is my 5th new Honda but my first SUV ever. I was a little unsure if I'd like a larger vehicle, but I really like driving the Pilot. Being higher makes it much easier to see, plus I feel safer on the road. I love everything about my Pilot EXCEPT I was really looking forward to the hands- free Bluetooth phone integrated into the navigation/stereo system. I am very disappointed in its performance. The quality of the phone call on the other end is bad...I always have people telling me they can't hear me very well at all - they say I sound like I'm in a cave.

The added dash displays make the driver smarter and more cognizant of maximizing opportunities. I'm very satisfied with this vehicle all around and recommend it highly. It's a buyer's market and mine (fully loaded with crossbars, all-weather mats, side steps, wood trim interior, appearance package) out the door with all taxes, tags, delivery, prep, etc. was under $35,000. Leverage your buying power and get one for yourself!</TEXT>

<TEXT>If I could give Honda/Acura a "20" in reliability, I would. My 06 Acura TL was feeling cramped with 2 car seats lodged in the back. We looked first at bigger cars, then sat in the back of a Honda Pilot and looked around. The thing has a LOT of family friendly amenities, and the rear temperature control is superb; it heats up quickly and stays at the set temperature. Driving it was a pleasant surprise to me, a gearhead car devotee. In short, it feels tight and light; body roll feels minimal, and it brakes and corners competently under moderate usage. It's the most car-like SUV I've ever driven. Acceleration is leisurely compared with my fast TL, but the kids are oh-so-much happier. TY HONDA!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Eight comfortable to sit in and easy to get in seats. Although its large on the inside, it heats up quickly (I haven't had it long enough to know how quickly it cools down). Love the plentiful cup holders. You mash a button, and the tailgate opens - alternatively, you can also pop the rear glass.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Since purchasing this SUV I've been more than pleased. It makes driving fun again. It's roomy but sleek on the inside. I've found that it has plenty of power for everyday driving and I've averaged 20 MPG so far (both city & HWY). After driving domestic cars my whole life I can now see why they are in so much trouble. The Honda Pilot is best in its class in my opinion.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We originally stayed away from this vehicle due to the so called expert reviews. Sorry boys but you have missed the mark. We went looking for months and at the end of the day the new Pilot is the choice for those with any common since. The Tahoe is supposedly a full size yet the Pilot with all three seats up can hold something in the rear. "like a cooler!!!!!" The Tahoe, with all the seats up, you could not get a full size cooler in the back. Take a hint Detroit.</TEXT>

The interior is roomy enough for several kids and all of their gear. Road noise seems less than in older models. Gas mileage is not great - 16 mpg on average, but it's mostly city driving. I have black interior/exterior and it's really classy looking. Was mistaken for the big Mercedes SUV the other day! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Originally hated the new styling, hoped for more rounder then boxy. Now that I own one, I like the shape, it grew on me. We are very happy with this vehicle. Coming from an 04 Pilot there are many changes, more space, bigger feel, smoother drive, better interior. Plastic dash doesn't bother me, controls are easy to learn. I do find myself sitting forward when driving, it's not the headrest but the support behind my back pushing me forward. Seats are very comfortable. Pick-up can be a bit sluggish when merging onto the highway. Love the radio and the way it displays station, song title and artist. Much better access to the handle for lowering the third row then in the 2004. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Radio displays, you always know what song and who's singing. XM radio, MP3 outlet. Space and lots of it. Comfortable seats.

The stereo, XM radio and DVD player are great. I enjoy driving this vehicle. I have had no issues with the cruise control or acceleration speeds. I'm not a big fan of the middle console between the front two seats. It's a weird size and junk gets lost in it. The glove box is pretty much worthless.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a "plain Jane" LX FWD version in fall of 2008 because it beat the nearest competition (GMC Arcadia) on interior features, width of roominess and price ($4500 cheaper on base model after all the rebates and negotiation at actual dealers). After 1 year of internet search, two car shows with a measuring tape in hand, I test drove both the Pilot and Arcadia back to back on the same piece of city/highway road on the same day. Pilot has great sound, is smooth and quiet and had the exact room I needed - I wanted to be able to have two 36 in long dog crates kept regularly in the back of the SUV with the 3rd seat down and still be able to have the 2nd row seats up for passengers. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior width of Pilot is slightly more than Arcadia/Outlook/Englave but slightly shorter bed- tradeoff. Really impressed with the interior on the base model. City highway MPG combined is about 19/20 is very good for the size of the vehicle. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We were torn between a Toyota Highlander and the Pilot and went with the Pilot because of the cavernous interior and more comfortable seat. We definitely made the right decision! We've only had the car for about a week. Others have complained about the lack of pick up but we don't have any complaints. We love the interior. Although it feels so roomy, it is much easier to park and maneuver then it looks. I do agree with the others who stated that some of the interior components seem a little cheap. Also, I've never had a rear wiper before and I've gotten OCD about keeping the darn thing clean. Are they always so prone to dirt? I seem to be spraying and wiping constantly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had the 2009 Pilot EX AWD for a month now. We looked at this and the Toyota Highlander after having a Mercedes ML320 for 10 years. This car is very roomy. The seating arrangements are very flexible for the 2nd & 3rd rows. Engine is very quiet and smooth but there is some road noise. The EX does not have leather seats but the fabric is VERY nice. Hard to describe but kind of a hi-tech feel. The seats are very comfortable with plenty of adjustments. At first I thought the front interior looked kind of plasticy (if that's a word) but it's because there's so much room in front. It really looks fine and the fit and finish is very solid. Gas mileage is only 14.5 in city driving so far.</TEXT>

We are hoping that this Pilot will do the same for us. We are enjoying it so far. We had a snow storm and it drove like a tank as it plowed through ice and snow. We were looking at the 4runner and we found that the Pilot drove much better - the drive feels more comfortable, yet firm and responsive to drive, it also feels much more powerful - even with the V8 version of the 4runner. Finally you get more for your money with the Pilot. </TEXT>

Once I test drove the Pilot, I fell in love. I will say that it is not nearly as fun to drive but functionality and space overcome the need for speed. Comfort matches if not beats the 09 MDX I tested. I also tested the GM equivalents including the overpriced fully-loaded Enclave.

I researched the vehicles on line and then went to a few dealerships, stopping at a Honda dealer last to check out the CRV. On the floor was the Pilot, it had the room I wanted and a nav unit which I felt was a must, one test ride and I was hooked. By controlling my speed I average right at 24 MPG highway driving which for all the size and comfort is acceptable </TEXT>

Don't think there's another SUV in this class with so many standard features for price, like backup camera, leather, sunroof, and RES.

I looked at everything in this category including Highlander, Veracruz, CX-9, Traverse, Arcadia and the Acura MDX. Hands down, the Pilot trounces them all in features, technology and value. This vehicle has better tech than even the more expensive Acura MDX (USB audio interface for iPod). If you are looking at a mid/full size SUV - you must consider the Pilot.

<TEXT>We bought this vehicle with great expectations based on reputation. We are disappointed with it so far. To start, it's vastly underpowered with poor acceleration. Entering/exiting is difficult due to awkward position of the driver's seat, which doesn't move back automatically when entering/exiting. Driver's position is poor as your knees rest on the dash when seated in reach of the steering wheel. Audio system is poorly designed. When watching rear DVD system, the system insists on ProLogic II surround mode. The center channel speaker is located in dash, so people in back can't hear movie dialog unless volume is cranked, which is annoying for people in front.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 06 Accord in for a Pilot because of space issues after having our first child. I love my Pilot! The space in the back is amazing (with the back seat laid down). The drive is awesome. My husband keeps saying he can not believe how well it drives. The gas mileage is a bit disappointing but we realized that it would drop drastically from my Accord. we are averaging around 17-18 mpg. One complaint is the fog light inserts. Because of the base model, the just put some plastic caps in them. Not too attractive.
