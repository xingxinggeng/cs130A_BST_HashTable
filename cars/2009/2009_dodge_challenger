<TEXT>I have waited many a year for this kind of vehicle, and now I have one! I still remember the hemi-cudas, six-pac super bees, etc. but never owned one. When I seen the new Callengers, I just had to have one. And I tell you, if you want a car that gives excitement, this is it! 425 hourses with 420 ft/lb torque is just plain sick! And the looks and the comments are never ending when I am driving "the Beast" around! Everytime I get in her, I can't get rid of that "you know what" eating grin off my face! Especially after a couple Mustang GTs found out what it was like to mess with that 6.1 liter under the hood! Thank you Dodge for bringing back the excitement!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks, the sound of the exhaust and that 6.1 liter in the upper RPM band, the awesome Kicker sound system, the looks and comments from everyone.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded an 07 C6 for this 09 6 spd SRT8 and could not be happier. The comfort level, smooth ride, and power when you need it is what driving a car is all about and this car has it. It certainly does get the attention from others. Dodge did this one right.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this car in late Feb 09, have put roughly 8600 miles (Aug 09) on it since then and am still very pleased with my choice. For reference I replaced a 99 Malibu. Exterior is amazing, still draws comments and gawking stares, corners extremely well for its size. Interior is a lil uninspired, strongly recommend the sunroof to avoid a cave- like feeling. Very comfortable though and plenty of room in the back seat and trunk. 0-60 seems a lil lacking, but 60-80 is near instantaneous. Putting an exhaust on it soon, a lil quiet for a sports car. Engine bay is large, plenty of mod space. very reliable, NO mechanical issues to date. Gas mileage is about 23mpg combined highway/city. Love this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought an '09 R/T Challenger in February. The ignition module failed after 4500 miles. The car sat at the dealership for almost 2 weeks while they kept telling me that they could not find the parts. Finally they fixed it. When I got it back, it was scratched and the interior was filthy (of course this was the dealership's fault that I took to). Also on 4 occasions prior to the ignition failing, the vehicle was hard to start - it acted like the battery was low. The cruise control resume did not work smoothly (you could hit the resume button at about 60 mph and it would jerk it's way back to 70). Anyway I traded it for a new GT Mustang last week. Too many heartaches.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first Dodge or Chrysler vehicle that I have ever purchased, and all I can say is that I am VERY impressed! I have owned Ford and Chevy products, but Dodge got theirs right! The ride is smooth yet planted, but if you want to get squirrely just mash the accelerator. As for gas mileage, I typically get 12mpg in city, and 23mpg on the highway. But I didn't buy this car for it's gas mileage, I bought it for it's retro styling and performance. A throw back to the 70 Challenger, and Dodge didn't miss a beat with this car. Also the DriveSRT Experience that is included with purchase of any SRT, WICKED COOL!! This little perk allowed me to race all the SRT vehicles available in 09! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6.1L Hemi rated at 425hp/425ftlbs... 6 speed manual transmission from the Viper... 3.92 rear gears (65mph = 1500rpm in 6th)... Traction control total and hybrid disabling feature...

<TEXT>The fun to drive factor on the SRT is off of the charts. Agressive driving on the streets does not challenge this car in the least. It is quiet at highway speed. At 75 mph (western States speed limit) It gets better gas mileage than than most 4 cyl. cars. It doesnt brake a sweat cruising at higher speeds. How many econo boxes can average 25 mpg at over 80 mph and do it all day with no issues. America has been fooled into believing that an econo box that gets 35 mpg on the highway will do that at high speeds. NOT!!!...Love this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of trunk space, very comfortable to drive long distances. Very quiet on the highway. Lots of horsepower to play with. Corners very well. Handles bumpy roads extremely well. Stops on a dime and gives you change. Outstanding sound system, it will put the ricers to shame. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this car for half a year or so, and I absolutely adore it! It is a very quick car that has a large aftermarket following to make the car screaming fast. The styling is by far one of the best of any cars out there right now while still being usable. I can fit myself and 3 full sized friends in the car with ease and comfort, something I know isn't possible in the competition. The ride is amazing, seeing as it was fitted with mercedes tuned suspension, and the attention it gets is unmistakable. It's not the fastest car on the road (stock) but there will always be another car that is faster. The looks of this car and the feeling I get is purely unique to the Challenger. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the styling more than just about anything. I'm a young guy who wasn't alive during the original muscle car days, but I surely can appreciate amazing styling when I see it! The 6speed and the 5.7 HEMI (that still gets almost 30 mpg on the freeway as I calculated over a 3000 mile trip) is great</FAVORITE>

It accelerates, handles, and brakes like no other car that I have owned. Its retro shape and Hemi-orange color turn heads every where I go.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Under 5 sec. 0-60 mph acceleration and fantastic retro styling. Dodge "hit a home run" on this car. The SRT Track Experience and 1-year free Sirus radio are nice bonuses.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great car, probably the best I have ever owned. The car is quiet, runs smooth, gets a lot better gas mileage than I anticipated, and has power to spare. The most fun is that I feel like a celebrity. I have had this black Challenger R/T for about 4 months. I have met more people who just want to talk about the car. I constantly get the thumbs up. The Japanese can't design and make a car like a Challenger with this styling, power and performance, and at a great price. This is American automotive know-how at its best. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2009 Dodge Challenger SRT8 is an absolute BEAST!!! I was first drawn to the Challenger by its incredible retro- styling. The broad sholders and intimidating front grill (much different from any other Dodge grill pattern) just made this car stand out and grab your attention. Although the car looks great, what really sold me on the car was the way it drove. Once I sat behind the wheel and drove the SRT8 (with the 6 speed manual transmission) I was simply blown away. The car growled and rumbled with sheer power and accelerated like nothing I have ever driven before. The 6.1 Hemi with the 6 spd transmission convinced me that I would enjoy the Challenger for years to come.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>the 6.1 Hemi and 6 speed transmission sells this car. The sheer acceleration and growl of the powerful engine is its best feature. The car's navigation and blue-tooth sync system is also very nice. Feels like a luxury car more than a rugged Muscle Car inside.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Saw the Concept car in late 2006. Hadn't bought a new car since 1986 - nothing worth getting excited about - until I saw the Challenger. Ordered my SRT in March, got it in November. It was worth the wait. 6 speed is tight, limited slip 3.92 gearing is great. 425 HP from 370 cu in is better than the original 426 cu to hp ratio. Handles like a car half its weight. The styling is amazing. The Pacifica Studio folks did a great job! Hit the retro look nail on the head in every way! Can't go anywhere without someone wanting to chat about the car - and look under the hood. Huge trunk and back seats - compared to Mustang and Camaro. The car has been flawless under all conditions. AMAZING RIDE!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The styling, power, Kicker Audio System, fit and finish, GREAT bolstered seats (heated and embossed leather), comfort are ALL great! Best feature is how retro it looks. It;s like owning a classic '70's Challenger, but without the demand of regular repairs and adjustments. Just start it and GO!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Over the years, I've owned three Corvettes and while I loved those cars, nothing compares to the Challenger. As a 20-something driving an '07 Corvette, most of the attention I was getting was negative whereas the Challenger gets nothing but positive attention. The car is plenty fast for its size and the interior is large and comfortable. At 6'6" few cars can fit me, but the Challenger is very comfortable and I can actually fit three people with me - something I couldn't say with a Camaro or Mustang. The shifts are a little long and the skip-shift, while annoying, is something I'm already used to with my Corvette's Tremec 6-Speed. Overall, I love the look, the character, and speed of my SRT.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks, bar none. I've wanted a Challenger since I saw the concept in 2006 and the production car looks even better than the concept did. The 6.1 isn't nearly as fast as my old Vettes, but with about 700 pounds more heft, that's expected. The pistol grip is to die for and I LOVE my B5 Blue color.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Generally a great car. I have always really liked the late 1960s Dodge B body (Charger) and E body (Challenger) cars. The new Challenger distills the old E body car design without the noise, handling, body flex, and 10 mile per gallon issues of the older muscle cars. The acceleration and handling are great, IMO. I picked the 5.7 liter R/T as the best compromise on engine power, cost, and gas mileage. There have been two glitches; at 3500 miles the airbag light came on for a few seconds while cruising. And at 4000 miles the alternator / battery light came on and stayed on until I shut the engine off and restarted. The dealer checked all wiring and found nothing. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hemi Orange color sure gets attention. People love the car and how it looks. Twenty inch wheels look great; nice growl from the exhaust pipes; excellent boulevard and freeway ride. Has a wind noise free and quiet ride, and a great sound system. </FAVORITE>

My girl is a Hemi Orange, 6 speed manual with stripes. We turn heads everywhere we go. I work at a large retailer, and customers actually ask who owns the car and seek me out to tell me they love it:) (& are usually surprised I'm female) I've had no issues with the car during the 1st 3500 miles. I get about 17mpg in town and about 21mpg on highway trips. The trunk is huge, and the extra spot where the spare tire would be is very useful to store small items (like her own little vacuum)out of sight with no rattling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always owned Mustangs ever since high school and boy did that change when I saw the new Challenger. I had just got a 2004 Cobra the car of my dreams, or so I thought. One thing I never really cared for was that Mustangs were so small and had no room for family, they also rode a little ruff after a while, definitly not a dailey driver or for road trips. We went to the dealership and they had one left, they wanteed 42, but I talked them down to 34, wich is good considering I live in Cali. My wife was hesitent but after we took it to Oregon to break it in, she fell in love with it. As much as it weighs, this thing is still fast, and so smooth at the same time. Such a head turner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had dreams of buying this car once I saw it as a concept vehicle. The picture of the car stayed posted on my refrigerator for the next 2 years. I finally took the plunge and treated my self to a virtual fountain of youth. Yes, back to my muscle car days of Camaros, Corvettes and Monte SS. (I still have the 1970 AMX!) This car is a pleasure to drive and I must say, no matter where I go, people look, thumbs up, ask questions and even ask if they can sit in it. A definite head turner and handles like dream.The 6.1 hemi under the hood makes this car a real animal!(Did I mention it gets better gas mileage than my Durango did) Great job on this baby!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6.1 hemi has all the get up and go you need. The styling is truely back to muscle car days of years gone by.Its fully loaded with all of the latest gadgets and upgrades!

<TEXT>Test drove the Challenger and had to own it. It's a head turner for sure. The Hemi-Orange is a real standout and gets attention. Acceleration is impressive be it gradual on surface streets after upshift, or stomping it on the freeway entrance. Slower than the old 426, but does get up and run. Excellent handling a joy to drive. Moderate pavement noise. Hope it doesn't get worse. This not a young persons car. First time in my life a vette picked a fight, they NEVER do that. I didn't even try, I knew better, and street racing is bad news period. This car is all about the look, feel, and pride of owning one. Glad Chrysler brought it back. Now if they would just retro the Charger....</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The retro look, the 45 mph rumble is sweet music. Excellent handling, safety features, comfort, appearance inside and out.

I decided to take a test drive expecting the car to be rough around the edges and not refined enough for my taste. Boy was I wrong! This car has everything you could ever ask for...unmatched power and the most comfortable ride I've ever experienced. It reminds me of my grandparents Caddy...super plush but this car is so stylish and soooo fast. Nobody has been able to keep up with me. The looks from people everywhere I go are priceless.

Several months later, I'm picking mine up on my dinner break. I like to believe that I carry myself with modesty for the most part, but admittedly I do enjoy the attention she gets. Ask any Challenger owner. It's just such a beautiful car. I still turn several times to look at it as I walk away after parking it. To top it off, it's a fantastic ride and the price is unbelievable for the package. Much more old-school than the Camaro.</TEXT>

<TEXT>WOW, Bring back the E-Body Mopars with all we loved Plus. Add stopping, turning, reliability, gadgets to my old 71 Cuda and you scratch the surface of what this car is. Although a little porky due to all the gadgets and safety equipment, this baby still performs well. The car gets more attention than anything out there and in case someone didn't notice stomp on it and the 6 speed version roars loauder than the auto since the suitcase muffler is deleted. The car handles well and the performance gauges show some of my roadcourse results with 0.99 lateral acceleration. Thew car seats 5 so my family of 5 can fit for some cruises or to shows without the need of a 2nd vehicle. Car is AWESOME</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Challenger for 7 months now and I still grin when I get in it. The car always draws lots of attention; I've even had people take pictures of it at stop lights! The performance is stellar. I took it and my 540i BMW to the Miami Homestead Speedway for an all day race. My son drover the BMW and I drove the Challenger along with 20 or so other cars. I fully expected the BMW to out corner the Challenger but the reverse was true. The Challenger took the turns faster and more sure footed than the BMW and blew it away on acceleration. The brakes were truly awesome never fading in stopping this 4,200 beast. I passed several Corvettes and never once hinted of spinning it out. WOW</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>$100,000 of fun for $42,000. It's got the best of the 1970 Challenger with all the modern goodies. It's fast, torquey, comfortable and great looks. It also has a 5-star safety rating to boot! </FAVORITE>

Great car and I have owned a lot of muscle in the past such as z28,409/w3 duces in a 61 impala, 68 gto just to mention a few. Hang tough at the dealerships when buying they will come down if your strong.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car, everyone stops me and wants to talk about this car, I went with the se model due to pricing.. Add dual cat back exhaust where I felt more power response. Getting the Windows tinted was not a good experience... Thinking about adding cold air intake down the road, I had one problem with mine at 500 miles had a problem with the engine? told me the flywheel was damaged? scary but the dealership fixed it, and had no problems since at least for now the car is great to drive, wish the v6 had a little more power... </TEXT>

<TEXT>These so call expert "reporters" want to compare this car to Mustang but I disagree. I compare this car to any 2 door BMW, Mercedes, Jaguar, and Aston Martin. Dollar for Dollar the Challenger Blows them all away. This car is beautiful in every way, drives like a car costing 2 to 3 times as much. Dodge did a great job with this vehicle, it may be one of the best looking cars available for any price. This car has it all Beautiful styling, excellent power, great fuel economy for a car of this horsepower, very comfortable functional and beautiful interior. If your looking for a coupe with space and power to match its looks (unlike say an accord) this baby is for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Chrysler nailed it when they built this baby! The retro styling and big engine take me back to when I had my old muscle cars. This car is not about economy, thrift, or "green" driving. This car says "I love to drive!" The acceleration is heart-thumping, the braking is excellent, the handling is very good and right down to the "thump" of the doors, everything is just as a muscle car should be. The only thing that I wasn't prepared for was the "rock star" treatment from people everywhere. People stop their cars beside mine, the give me the thumbs up, I have even had some guys ask me to pop the hood. I have met quite a few good people through this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Dropped off my 300C for end of lease to trade in for another, and saw this beauty and fell in love. Employee pricing + 0% financing sealed the deal. Even the wife gave me an okay and my father in law gave thumbs up. Not middle age crisis, but middle age celebration. Full Disclosure: Never had a muscle car as a youth, only two stock 1980s Camaros, so this is filling a void for me - psychoanalyze that. Teenage son and friends are drooling, and middle aged guys come up to me at the laundry, gas station, parking lot, whatever, asking about it, and it is embarrasing since one wants to be humble. But in the end, it's an Ego booster. Chrysler's final mark and legacy if they don't make it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car will impress you in ways you can't imagine. For years I have wished that Dodge would take the body style of a 1970's era Challenger and put in on a modern chassis. This car has the retro styling without the drawbacks. I have the 5.7L Hemi mated to the 6-speed manual. It was the only option I wanted or paid for. That made this car a bargain high-performance car, especially when you factor in the incentives being offered. It is a blast to drive. It has a tight ride without being too stiff. It turns everyone's head. I love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got the black on black R/T with the 6 speed track pak.I love to start this car and hear the pipes rumble. I ease that clutch and she bites a chunk of pavement and begs for more road to eat up.Second day I had it we went for a 3 hour ride across the state. With 6 gears the motor breathes and sips the gasoline for 22 mpg. On the street people stare at this car like they are watching a magic trick.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Its got a HEMI and rear wheel drive with a 6 speed tranny,leather heated seats, and it looks every bit as cool a classic muscle car from the 70's. Like a 'cuda with a Mercedes suspension and a Viper drivetrain.I like the fold down seats in the back and the trunk space.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I knew when I purchased the Challenger SRT8 in Hemi orange that I would get attention but I did not expect so much. It is a social experiment every time I take this car out. Part of the effect is on me as I feel my juices flow every time I take it out. But the bigger laugh is all the comments, thumbs up, and gawkers everywhere I go. I could have bought a car for six figures and it would not have grabbed so much attention as this Challenger does. I have even had the county sherriff deputies following me in their Charger and scoping out my Challenger. The best part is that it is as crazy fast as it looks and that Sherriff Charger would not have stood a chance. </TEXT>

I purchased a black 6 speed R/T and do not have one complaint with the car. The seats are more than comfortable, the performance is great and when you can keep your foot out of the floor, the gas mileage isn't bad for a sports car. Back seat room is good for this type of car too. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Ive been watching these since the concept car in 06 (owned Cudas and Challengers as a young man). I finally drove one and left the lot with it. Ive owned Vettes and Saabs and this car blows them away. I can't wait each day to go fire her up. Manual transmission is fantastic. Sometimes forget it has the 6th gear. Very comfortable, smooth ride. Handles like a dream. With current incentives it made this car more affordable (comes with lifetime drive train warranty). Having owned old style Cudas and Challenger the upgrades done on this modern Challenger are superb. Many people give the thumbs up or stop me to ask questions. This is a keeper.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased an 09 challenger Hemi R/T Black/Black, leather, Trak Pak. Got $4000 off sticker and 0% for 48 months. A bargain. I have purchased over 20 cars since 1986, including some expensive German iron, and the Challenger is in a class by itself. You are truly the king of the road in this car. It is more than just a retro design excercise, it is a great car in its own right, and possibly the last of its kind. If you are thinking about getting one, do yourself and the economy a favor and do it. You won't regret it.</TEXT>

The style of the car caught my attention, then after a test drive i wanted one. The interior is very comfortable, very nicely done leather seats. The power sunroof is an bonus feature. The car still gets ton of looks but most importantly it has the look i want, the performance, and makes driving fun.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the looks, the leather in the interior is great, the car still has the new smell some 2 months after I got it.

<TEXT>Bought my Challenger during holiday vacation as a present to myself for my 40th birthday. Was considering all the known 40ish suspects - Acura, BMW, Infiniti, etc. but wanted to get something different and more exciting. Saw the Challenger and had to have it. Drove the Charger and liked it but fell hard for the styling and ride of the Challenger. Love the way it drives - power, control and fun. Have already had several folks follow me to a stoplight or gas station to ask about the car. Lots of thumbs up and nods from other guys with cool car envy. Opted for the R/T as a compromise vs the upgrade to SRT. All black with tinted windows looks awesome. The best car I have owned to date. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Drove my brother's 2008 SRT8 & had to have one. This isn't a car anyone needs, but if you have money to waste, you'll never waste it on anything that's more fun to drive. Because of it's size, weight & Goodyear F1 SuperCar tires, it feels as if it's actually attached to the road. No matter how fast that Hemi propels you, the suspension will control the car & those hugh brakes will stop you. You never feel as though you can lose it, except on as little as 1/4" of snow. If you must drive in snow, do not buy the F1 tires. Let's face it, if you're one of the "Green" people, or one of the "PC" crowd, you'll find this car incomprehensible. If you grew up in the 60's, no explanation needed! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Oh man, this beast is absolutely awesome! Base non-leather seats are very comfortable and supportive. The pistol-grip 6-speed shifts very well and the clutch isn't heavy at all - the take-up is a little high, but you quickly get used to it. The hill- holder feature comes in handy on hills. The performance of the 5.7 is truly exceptional, and gets noticeably better after 1000 miles. Plan for some extra time at gas stops, as you'll get swarmed by various gawkers and wannabes - this car gets more attention than a Ferrari. The styling is absolutely spot-on, better than the 2006 concept - hard to believe this is the same company that makes the ugly Chrysler Sebring and Jeep Compass. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very deep, throaty exhaust note with the 6-speed - if I didn't know any better I'd swear it already has a Borla catback system on it. Very solid overall feeling. It really doesn't feel like it weighs 2 tons. Has all of the best features of the original 70 model (and then some) without the drawbacks.</FAVORITE>

Everything works, everything is flawlessly working as it was intended to do. I have put over 4,500 miles on it now, with no issues. The nav system and sound system are nothing short of amazing to me. The interior is clean and very functional. Only a couple things could be improved in my opinion. Once you get used to it, the blind spots are not a problem whatsoever. There is not much I would change on this car, some very small issues. Driving it is such a pleasure, I look forward to it every day! #1 of all the retro cars</TEXT>

I traded in a Mini Cooper S works car so the first thing I noticed is the roomy interior. A bit more power would be nice, but opted for better mileage. Handling was a surprise for this size of car. Much better than I expected. Road noise, what road noise. Electrics are smooth and quiet. Comfort and driving position superb. Yup, happy I got it...</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car for the price. It has very decent acceleration for the size and can handle turns at fairly high speeds. I'm used to driving smaller Japanese cars so this was a change. Going with the 3.5 L helps with gas and the overall look of the car(did not like the silver gas cover or wing on the r/t) I also like that the price is 8k less than the r/t. If you go base model, get the G package because it comes with bigger rims and fog lights. It's only $2000 more. But the overall feel is the best I've felt in a long time and it gets the most looks(even in L.A.).I drive in a lot of traffic so I'm averaging a little under 290 miles to the tank. costs $58 to fill up where I'm At. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Wife had to have it. I did not object. It drives easy and the ride is surprisingly smooth. There is plenty of power, it doesn't sound obnoxious, and the Boston Acoustics sound system is quite good. This Challenger beats the snot outta the Mustang in all respects. I drove the GT and the Bullit trying to find a comparable ride. The difference is astounding. I own a Toyota Tacoma, and have always been wary of domestic cars as there are thousands of horror stories. In all, this car is a solid winner. Retro/modern done right, if a little pricey.

Inferno pearl red is a head turner at every light in town. The base MSRP, 09 Challenger is nice, but the dealers are still trying to sell them like the numbered SRT*8, 08's. The 3.5 high output V6 is not very quick off the line, but very quick to respond after you'er out of 1st gear. The car feels well balanced and can scream around bends and turns like the best of them. Outstanding road feel and a rocket on the Hwy. The G package ( 26G )has larger rims, fog lights, all speed traction control, 4 wheels ABS disc brakes, electronic stability program</TEXT>
