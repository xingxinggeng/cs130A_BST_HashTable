<TEXT>I purchased a new SEL with two options (ABS/ESC and Auto Tranny). I now have 3000 miles on the odometer and the car has performed flawlessly. Gas mileage has been good - 35 mph and getting better. I bought this car as a daily commuter, putting on 75 miles per day and in this regard, it has been ideal. I looked at Madza 3 and the Mini Cooper, but the price-point and simplicity of the Focus appealed to me. Also, having rented many small cars, I have had better-than-average experiences with the Focus. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase and would do it again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rides "bigger" than its actual size. I also like the high seating position</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Very satisfying driving experience! 36 tank fills of 50/50 mixed driving and I'm averaging 31 MPG actual (on-board computer says 32.1). Amazingly no rattles. Fit & finish very good, but door & cup holder plastic scratches easily. Dark blue metallic paint gets frequent compliments. Only maintenance: oil change/tire rotation! I added a 3- piece Curt Hitch (used for bikes, not towing) which is a perfect fit & well hidden behind bumper. The German built 5-speed manual is precise. The care appears tall for its width, but the looks will grow on you...mostly because the coupe is distinctive. Stereo should satisfy most listeners. A perfect commuting car. Only wish it was a hatch and seats folded flat</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Still steeply discounted: Leather heated seats & cruise for ~$16K...Wow! 17" wheels/tires look great and signifiacntly improve handling, but decrease MPGs a bit. Sync is outstanding. IPod interface works well. Large trunk.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the SEL because of the leather int, and fuel mileage. I average 33mpg overall city/highway. Because I live in a pzev state (maine) if you want power out if the engine it needs to be around 2500 rpm. Sync is good, stereo is good seats good, arm rest well placed at least for me (tall thin) seems the late model 09 have the trunk release inside and temp and compass. I drive on not the best secondary roads most the time so other than short wheelbase issues no real complaints. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>easy clean interior......dog fur sync foglights on secondary roads better than advertised fuel economy </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car rides great, pretty stiff suspension that handles bumps very well, and its very responsive and tight. It was mainly Sync that got my attention when it came to finding a new car. I do come from a family that has owned quite a lot of fords, because they made pretty decent cars. Take the build quality up a bit, and you get a new Ford. The car feels like its built very well. With only a 140hp engine, it does struggle to get up most hills. paired up with the 4 speed auto and no torque, driving on hilly roads isn't pleasant. I've only put 2500 miles on my car so far, but it seems to be pretty great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Big improvement in driving dynamics and nvh over previous foci. Well equipped for price. exterior styling is a hit or miss affair. I would prefer something a little less daring. Not crazy about squarish look on front bumper cover and hood line seems a little contrived. Haven't had car for long but NVH seems good and based on past experience with Ford don't expect many service issues. Good gas mileage for a "heavy" C car. Ford has spent a lot of effort to tweak gas mileage performance. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good blend between gas mileage and performance. Good handling. Doors have a solid feel on closing. Well equipped for price. $2-3k price diff vs corolla or civic. Very spacious interior for a c class car although rear leg room is tight. Excellent sided mirrors. high rear trunk makes backing up iffy</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have been long time drivers of the Honda Civic which is a nice small car. Our FORD Focus has been a delight and we think a big improvement over the Civic. Nice tight fit,good pep,easy handling, fun, mileage 36-37 on highway driving usually at 75mph. Feels roomier inside and when I had to put four adults and baby seat in there was no problem. We had a Ford Escort 1995 that is still going for friends at 200,000 miles. The Focus feels like that kind of solid but more jazz... Oh yeah nice SYNC.</TEXT>

The MPG is better than advertised; the "fit" is perfect; the Sirius radio is a great feature; the roominess, including a very large trunk, is wonderful. I would HIGHLY recommend it to any friend who was looking for a similar- sized car. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Thanks to web-sites like this one, my selection process was easier to make. We downsized from driving an Expedition for the last 10 years. Haven't had it long but so far this SEL has made the change an easy one and my wife loves it. Especially the GAS bill !! My son drives a 99' V6 Stang and it has been bullet- proof. So I lean towards driving another Ford product. Ford has done their home work on this one and has a winner for a small car. Ford must be reading these reviews because my SEL has 3 headrests in the back seat(2 would be enough) and an inside trunk release which earlier models lacked. Will report back in about 20K miles to update my review. All for under $19K, I'm very impressed</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything others have mentioned.... 6 air bags, Fit & finish, solid build on a small car. Rides more like a midsize sedan. Roomy, easy to get in and out of. Very competitive price compared to others in its class. Yes, the sound system is very nice !! Test drive one and make your own conclusions!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've been extremely pleased with my 09 Focus SE coupe. I chose the 5spd because I personally can't stand to drive a car that doesn't have a lot of torque paired with an automatic. With that said the clutch uptake is very smooth and the pedals are well spaced for heel toe downshifting. The shifter itself could be shorter but the detents for the gears are positive. The car rides like a midsize sedan, very quiet and smooth. It's leagues above my friends 08 Cobalt in ride quality and noise control. While it's no drag racer it definitely is entertaining in the twisties, with the 4wheel independent suspension. Not only does it soak up bumps mid corner with ease but it is also very forgiving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like that it has power everything (except seats) and heated mirrors. The steering wheel controls for the radio and leather wrapped steering wheel. Also Sync is a very easy to use system that helps you keep your eyes on the road while trying to change albums from your MP3 player or make a call. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have always loved Ford products. I don't buy anything else. Have to say I went from a Explorer to a Focus. The transition has been great. My view is wonderful and hardly any blind spots to be had, LOVE MY SYNC! The LED LIGHTS are great and very fun! The ride is smooth and very quiet. Rides and drives like a bigger car! Boggs down a little on the hill. The MPG is wonderful and actually getting for miles to the gallon than promised on the sticker.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a fully loaded Focus SEL with manual transmission. This car is simply designed beautifully. I am 6'4" and easily have plenty of headroom and can get 2 adults in the back without moving the seat. The stick shift is very smooth and ergonomically placed. This car zips nicely and gets me over 31 mpg so far. The sync system is really cool but the one complaint I have is the speaker placement. If you drive with the windows down like I do the wind noise really drowns out you stereo. They need to raise the speakers higher so they are closer to your head. Also,I got the SEL which makes the interior really nice. I noticed base models seem to have really cheap interiors.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased this weekend as a commuter car (130 miles/day round trip). I really like what Ford did with the re-design. The old version was pretty ugly, but this one looks good for an econobox. After only 250 miles, getting almost 40 on the highway and 33 overall in a fair mix. I'm 6'3" and the two door allows easy entry and exit - plenty of legroom. Performance is about what you would expect from a N/A 4-banger - not spectacular, but sufficient. Sirius is cool. First Ford I've ever owned, so we'll see how it goes. Impressed by the fact they didn't need a bailout and they actually had inventory to choose from. So far, so good. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the legroom that the coupe provides. Dash lights look cool at night. Lots of options for a commuter car - doesn't look like a rental car - tinted headlights, spoiler, aluminum wheels, exhaust tip. 5 speed seems very well sorted out - not clunky at all. Huge trunk, rear folding seats are nice</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After a week driving a new Focus all over Washington State, I found the gas mileage to be very good (about 31 mpg overall), but the seats very uncomfortable, the handling poor, and the ride bouncy. It is amazing that in 2009 a company the size of Ford can still design such bad (ergonomically poor) seats. No lower back support. No lateral support. The suspension is soft, but when you hit a big bump it quickly bottoms out, and shakes the whole car. Anybody who MUST have an American car may be happy with it, but if you also drive a Mazda3, HOnda Civic, Sentra, etc. you'd never buy this car. Very disappointing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great little car. It is what it is though, and that is a eco-box with a few luxury and sport options. The loaded SES with 17" wheels and a 5-speed is very fun to drive. I wish the option for a ~200HP engine were available. The suspension in the SES is not as hard as the Honda Civic SI, but handles pretty well for a 4-door. The seats are extraordinarily comfortable. The back seats are fairly roomy too. I would buy the car again. It is a commuter and backup family car for me, so it works out well. Not recommended for more being primary grocery getter for more than 1-child. Perfect for commuting, students, occasional running about the town or as a primary touring vehicle for 2.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SYNC. It integrates USB Flash Audio, Vehicle Management, Blue-tooth Audio, etc. as well or better than current generation luxury cars. Very decent mileage w/ manual trans...35-42 MPG by driving hyper conservatively; 30 MPG with typical driving; and 25 MPG with spirited or in-city traffic driving</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I received this as a Christmas present from my Dad this past Christmas. I'm 18 and this was a huge upgrade from my grandma's 1994 Ford Tempo I was driving around. All I can say is wow. It has a good amount of power and the brakes are fantastic. I drive it pretty hard, but I still get about 26-28 mpg doing a mix of city and highway driving. It's hard to explain, but the car just feels "solid". The doors close with a dull thud, instead of a hollow bang. Even things like the turn signal lever feel well built. The steering is tight and easy to maneuver, even at high speeds. The ride is overall excellent.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SYNC - by far is my favorite feature. If you don't get it, you are really missing out. It works flawlessly. Also I love the ambient lighting, leather steering wheel, steering wheel controls, dimming rear view mirror, and awesome dashboard lights.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have to state this was a short rental, but first American Ford I've driven in 30 years. Great build quality and reasonably quiet. Acceleration on I-71/I-75 in uphill in Northern KY south of Cincinnati rather labored and noisy. Good brakes, but climate control needed a lot of adjusting. Am now really interested in 2010 Fusion Sport model as this Fusion at the price is a great buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned many cars and this is my favorite of all time. In the past 3 years I've owned over $100K in new cars and none of them pleased me like my Focus does. I went from a 2009 Honda Accord Coupe V6 and 2008 Honda Civic Si before that, to this car and could not possibly be happier. It does not rattle at all, unlike junk Hondas, and gets killer gas mileage. It rides like a bigger car than it is, which is awesome on city streets when you're hitting potholes and cracks. I hear no road noise. It is very, very quiet even with the "sport" muffler on the 5 speed coupe. SYNC blows away the Bluetooth in any vehicle I've owned. I cannot say enough about how good of a car this is. Bye Honda</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth ride, very smooth drivetrain, no rattles, great MPG, awesome stereo, very comfortable seats, build quality smokes Honda, corners well for how soft the ride is, very quiet, great shifter, great exhaust note, looks good, SYNC rules!, colored LEDs inside are cool, nice steering feel, i love it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I enjoy my 2009 Ford Focus SE. I bought the version with no Sync and I don't use the satellite radio. The automatic transmission shifts smoothly. I like the decent gas mileage and the smooth ride. Sometimes on hills the acceleration seems very slightly slow. I've put over 14000 miles on it since I bought it last September and so far it runs great. Trunk space is a real plus. One thing I'd like to see are hand grips above the driver and passenger doors. The placement of the interior light needs a rethink also. It doesn't adequately light the interior because it is too far forward. I keep cars a long time. I hope to have good things to say when I put this car over 100,000 miles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased my new focus this wekk and LOVE it! (5 speed manual). The day I drove it home from the dealer I made 37 MPG! For an automobile in this class, I could ask for nothing more and have had a few suprises too! Love the Moon and tune package, quiet ride, outstanding MPG. Previous reliablity has been phenominal! our 2001 has 240000 miles with NO issues as well as our 2002 with 150000 miles (daughter has it now) with NO issues other than regular maintence.

<TEXT>I gave my daughter my standard Civic and planned to get new Civic. I test drove the automatic Civic and I remembered why I got the standard. During acceleration, Civics bog at low speeds, and it is less noticeable in the standard. I test drove a Focus, and it was quicker to start (the 0-60 specs are equal but the Focus has more low- end torque). The Focus?s cloth seats aren?t as nice, but you can get Focus heated leather heated seats for the same price as Civic cloth seats! Also, the Focus has less road noise; the headlights are better (Consumer Reports backs this up); the reliability and safety are the same; it comes with Bluetooth phone (very cool!); and it is less expensive! Try a Focus!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have to say that I am 100% satisfied with this car. All around I think Ford put together a well built machine, from the way it drives to all the standard features in the SE model and up. When people ask me about the car and if I like it I highly recommend it. I test drove Honda's, Hyundai's, Toyotas, and it all came down to bang for my buck, this car was the best, i drive over 750 miles a week so i wanted something fun to drive and to be reliable over the years, every review i said that it was a great car, and so far, i agree. Good job ford</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>There are many things i love about the car, first is the SYNC, that should be in every car made, second, its just a fun car to drive, from the peppy motor to the tight road hugging steering. Its a well built machine</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my new Focus. We rode to the beach which is about 600 miles round trip and I got 42 MPH. I drive 84 miles per day round trip to work and back and normally get 35 MPG highway miles. The only complaint I have is there isn't a button to open the trunk which I thought was unheard of and the arm rest for the driver is back too far. The last thing is there isn't an interior light in the back seat so it's really dark back there at night when you are trying to look for something. Other than that it is a wonderful compact car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The first drive of the focus coupe was decent. I was impressed with the amount of features you get for the price. I searched for cheaper new cars and finaly picked the focus. I've grown to really like it. Its a good looking car with a sporty appeal. The interior is comfortably roomy and I love the sync and other toys ford has installed in the focus. It has enough power to do the job without a sacrifice in fuel economy. However the computer MPG is wrong by about 2 mpg to many which is a little misleading. Otherwise everything seems to work properly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With only 400 miles on it so far, I'm very impressed with my new Focus in all respects except one (the tires...see below). It's roomy despite being small, performs well (very peppy), is comfortable and quiet (except for the tire noise), gets excellent gas mileage (30 mpg city vs the 24 mpg EPA estimate) and has lots of standard bells & whistles. I opted for a fully loaded (with automatic) model, and for the small incremental difference in cost (only $2,000 or so) you get a whole lot more. There are some great incentives ($3,000 in rebates) on this car right now too, which makes it even more appealing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Location and layout of the controls, especially the duplicates on the steering wheel. The dashboard backlighting colors are fantastic too. The ambient lighting is OK, but a dome light over the rear seat would be more useful/functional. The trunk is huge for a car this small.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this car 6 weeks now. Love how it drives, great gas mileage, 30.2 city and got 38.7 on a recent trip to Indiana. It gets around and handles well. The only thing I noticed was the cross winds out on the highway messes with the handling a bit so you have to pay close attention. As for the interior, I got the cloth type seats, and it is all that hard plastic. The plus about it is easy to clean but it does collect lint really easy so I have to keep wiping it down. My dealer talked me out of the SYNC unfortunately and I wish I had it but the Sirius is wonderful but needs better audio system. Great car for the price,,would buy it again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>In the first 100Kilometers, we know that the front brakes were grinding. We brought the car back to the dealer. They said that it was a normal sound. We brought the vehicle for the third time and at 10,000 kilometers for its first oilchange, and the front brakes are still sound like grinding. The dealer is not willing to replace the brakes, they say that it is normal. The car rides nice and is very affortable. We were also told that we had syrius satellite free for 6 months, However, after only 3 months it stopped. We enjoy the car, but found the service to be somewhat mediocre. thanks,</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was quite a deal. A SES for $14,150! (list was $18,295). Beware, the $500 Ford cash for using their credit will yield you a 10.75% interest rate. I took that deal but will pay it off early so it doesn't matter. Manual trans but with a 4 cyl that's the only way to go. Reasonable quiet and smooth, build quality seems good, even the temp control buttons on the dash have a good feel. No rattles or wind noise. THE deal for 2009.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Corney as it sounds I like the lighted cup holders. The engine will actually shut off 2 cylinders and run if it has over-heated (read your manual). Oil changes at ever 7500 miles. Nice size glove box and center console.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well I chose a Ford for my first new car, and my first manual transmission, and I have not once looked back. The tranny takes a little to break in but once it is you get seriously good fuel economy. The engine has some power, but it is found around 2000 rpm or so. The seats could be a little more comfortable, I don't know why they aren't real cloth, instead some weird shiny cloth material. It is comfortable, so that works. Other than that Ford makes very reliable cars that get you where you want to go, treat them well and they will treat you well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been a Honda owner for over 20 years! No problems and nothing bad to say about my rides over the years, but my 1999 CRV was getting a bit tired after 150G of miles and love. But time to move on. My choices are 2009-Mazda 3, Honda Civic, Pontiac Vibe and the Elantra (I saw all at the Detroit Auto Show) They were all great, with wonderful reviews but I wanted to get the best bang for my buck. I ended up checking out the Ford Focus SES Coupe and so glad I did! With Ford's incentive's and my local dealer working with me, I bought a beautiful car, loaded, thousands below the sticker. Will I miss my Honda? Not Sure , but Oh so happy with my new ride!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync is a great feature, well done. Sirius radio and sound system are great. Gas mileage at 30 MPG is impressive with my auto for the first 30 days. Solid doors (when closing ) make a solid impression. Great interior lighting Nice ride (Mom says she could sleep in here) Is that a Ford? It's hot! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>first let me begin by stating i beat and tear at this car constantly and it's a great all around car, i've had it for about a year and been in one accident and it runs like brand new still. although the trunk may be annoying at times because it is not bolted down but that's probubly its only fault, personally i have two dual JBL subwoofers in my trunk and they sounds great in the focus... all around outstanding quality.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car! The way this car looks in black is stunning. The wheels are dark chrome, the front grill is dark chrome, even the front and back lights have a dark chrome look to them. I may be biased towards that color but it looks much better then any other color offered. The interior is pretty good for a sub-compact. SYNC is very easy to use and to set up. Cloth bucket seats are comfortable. The car turns on a dime and is very nimble, even in reverse with the pedal to the floor. The ice blue dash looks incredible at night with the ambient lighting set to Purple. The standard sound system sounds better then I expected. The trunk is HUGE. You could probably fit grown 3 teenagers inside.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync, The whole exterior( black on black), and how peppy it is for a 4 cylinder eco car. The sport tuned exaust gives it a nice roar(growl?) compared to the SE model</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm having a problem with the cars handling...it vibrates and pulls when i get the car to 100km. So I was a little upset when I had to dish out money (for a rental) from my own pocket 4 months after purchasing a NEW car. Only to have them keep the car all day and tell me that it was the air in my tires??? Well they fixed the air pressure and it still vibrates. Now I have to have it checked by another mechanic or possible even have it inspected. (All out of my own pocket) All because they refuse to admit there is a problem with the car!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>My Focus was the first car I'd ever purchased, and while I wanted an affordable car, I didn't want to settle for the typical stripped down, no-frills, econobox. It has a lot of power and speed for a compact; press the accelerator and it gets moving. It also has some "luxury" features, like cruise control, Sync, a 6-disc CD changer, and satellite radio, that you can't normally get in a car that costs less than $20k. The gas mileage is also phenomenal for a non-hybrid car. While using it just for my incredibly short commute that consists of more parking lots and sitting at red lights than actual driving, it gets about 18 MPG. Get it out on the highway and 40 MPG isn't out of the question.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync, satellite radio, big trunk, high gas mileage, wonderful visibility (through the side and rear-view mirrors, I can easily 4-5 lanes of traffic - great because I live in the DC area)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I own a 2001 Focus with 105K miles, so I tested a 2009 model. The 2009 model is a quantum leap better than my old car. The new Focus has excellent handling and a quiet, nimble ride. Fuel economy is excellent with 39 MPG on the highway and about 28 in town. I average about 33-34 MPG in average driving and that's with the 4 speed automatic. I looked at the Toyota Corolla and the Honda Civic, but those cars cost thousands more in exchange for a marginal increase in quality & reliability. The Focus proved a better value overall. Advance Trac and SYNC are great features that virtually no other car maker offers in an automobile this inexpensive. Kudos to Ford! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable interior. SYNC (the biggest improvement in cars since GPS), Advance Trac, Heated Leather Seats, fuel economy, handling, quiet ride, int. & ext. color combinations. The outstanding reliability of my old 2001 Ford Focus was a huge selling point for the new model. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The automotive press really don't get the appeal of the Focus SES Coupe. They short change it on style and rate its performance lackluster. The truth is, this car is the complete package. Combine its blend of unique styling, confident handling, quiet/comfortable ride, stellar SYNC system with incredible fuel economy and give-away price incentives and you've discovered what makes the Focus special. Okay. It's not a performance car, but it doesn't feel like an economy car either. It's not spirited, but certainly agile. Import shoppers looking to balance fun, comfort and value really should take an SES 5-speed out for a test drive before shelling out cash for a Civic/Mazda 3/Corolla</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Where else can you find dynamic stability control, leather heated seats and 35 MPG for $16 grand. SYNC with Standard Sirius radio really differentiates the Focus at this price point. Nice manual gear box. Well laid out controls. 17" wheels/tires both look good and do significantly improve handling. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I spent about 80 man hours researching and test drving compact sedans before having to make a decision between the top two candidates: the Focus and the Elantra. I selected the Focus due to better overall value as for 1200 more the Focus provided Sync and leather seating (plus it looked better than the Elantra). After 6,000 miles I am quite confident I made a right decision as I have had no issues with it and the car does not get 24/33 MPG as auto tranny is listed. Rather since the engine has been broken in, it is getting something more like 28/37 as i got 35.9 on a recent 250 mile trip. The primary downside is the sluggish acceleration performance by the transmission. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>-SYNC! It is pretty awesome -Much better MPG than advertised -Possibly cheapest available vehicle with leather seats -Seems very reliable -Comfortable for 6'1" 220 lb man -Driver sits quite high for a compact </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Haven't had it long at all but wanted a smaller, good gas mileage, American car. Couldn't be more pleased so far. Very comfortable, smooth, outstanding gas mileage (30+ overall), and adequate power. Doesn't feel like an econobox tin can ala the Yaris I test drove. Sync is great as is the leather wrapped steering wheel. Interior quality seems worlds above the previous Focus. Really enjoy this car and glad I'm buying American again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I own a Lincoln MKX and was looking for a second commuting vehicle that was cheap in price and on gas. I am happy with my purchase of the Focus because it's built well and handles alot better than other cars that I test drove (Nissan Sentra, Toyota Carola). The interior is not the best quality however, it looks nice all lit up at night (If you take care of your car the interior should hold up just fine). The SYNC system is easy to use and very practical. The trunk is big on this little car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My new 2009 Focus SEL is an amazing little car. I had a 2006 Fusion SEL, and my lease just expired, so I bought the Focus SEL. Quieter than the 2.3 Fusion, more responsive, not as stiff, super ride, just as comfortable, amazing trunk, crisper, more fun to drive. I have had: Mercedes, Volkswagen, Honda, Volvo, Dodge, Austin, Wolsely, Pontiac, Renault, Mitsubishi. The two recent Ford experiences/products have been the best by far. I am impressed! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a 35mpg (wring out a few more, if you pay attention to the MPG meter) economy car that doesn't make you feel like you are driving an economy car. The motor has plenty of pep for accelerating into freeway traffic, although, it doesn't have much left after 65mph. The car handles very well right off the lot and the ride is surprisingly quiet and comfortable. If you can sacrifice a bit of that quiet and comfort for a greater improvement in handling and style, I would suggest going with the 17" wheel option with the 215/45 tires. I purchased mine after I took delivery of the car and paid almost double. The car overall feels well-built and reliable. I am very satisfied.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The styling, handling, power and accessories. Nice details and accents around the car make you feel like you are driving a much more expensive vehicle. The in-car electronics are a nice touch. Although I didn't care about Sync when reading the brochure, I now glad that I have it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I decided to purchase a small commuter car and since Ford is having such great deals I settled for the 2009 SEL. Leather seats are standard in the SEL, and they are very nice and comfortable, and stylish. The synch feature is great, I can use my cell or launch my ipod just by pushing a button on the steering wheel, and then just talking! Works great. The car rides nicely, and looks good to boot! And so far I am getting 25 MPG in town. My other car is a Lexus, but I am having more fun driving this little Focus. I even had someone comment to me today at the grocery store how nice my car looked! Never expected to get such a nice car for so little money. Thank you Ford!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a great car that offers excellent gas mileage. I found all that in the Ford Focus (SEL automatic). This car fits me to a "T"! I checked out several options in the same price range and nothing compared. Toyota and Honda are just too boring to drive and are so plasticky and cheap looking (who wants to see another Corolla on the road...certainly not me). I love all the neat gadgets this car comes with! Ford got this car right. I am very very happy with it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've always owned GM products but decided to try a Ford. I wanted a smaller car because of getting better gas mileage. I was surprised at how stylish the 2009 Focus is. It handles great and gets good gas mileage and is very peppy for a 4 cyl. I do miss my remote start that came standard on my Malibu, the sun visors are very cheaply made, outside temp & compass should be standard on all cars. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I previously owned a 2003 Mercury Sable. Traded it in for the 2009 Focus because the Sable had too many miles and I wanted something that got better gas mileage. I am impressed. It has more get-up-and-go than the Sable, rides every bit as well (actually quieter) and has every bit as much trunk space. Not to mention that it is more fun to drive. The Sync system is nice to have, it is good to have that connectivity in a car. Ford was forward thinking in putting this on their cars. All in all, I do not regret the trade at all. To begin with I was worried that the Focus might seem a lot smaller than the Sable. We didn't loose much.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We rented a focus while waiting for a 20" replacement tire for our mini van. My wife loved it but it was very plain. After getting the van back we stopped by the local dealer and were surprised at the new model lineup. Our van had 75,000 miles and it was time for a change. The SES package was very well equipped. Better auido system. 6 disk MP3, SYNC, sunroof and nice rims. The LED interior lights are cool and ours is an automatic not 5 speed. Got a very fair deal at 15,000. And much more then expected on the old van. It drives well for a 2.0 and handels just fine. Not much wind noise at freeway speed and cruise control is a plus. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SYNC is amazing. Auido system with Sub rocks. Sirus for 6 months a plus and interor LED's are very cool. Nice trunk.All controls on steering wheel a plus.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had the car for about two weeks and so far I am very impressed. I Sold a Toyota Matrix to buy this car because I wanted something made in Michigan, my home state. The car is quieter and smoother riding than the Toyota. It has a nicer interior. Although I miss the hatchback utility of the Matrix, I knew that going in. My first tank of mixed city/highway driving in winter weather yielded about 27.8 mpg with the four speed automatic. I got a good deal on the car from the dealer in my town and there were plenty on the lot so I didn't have to order one. Seriously, if you are in the market for a comfortable affordable compact car, take a test drive. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sirius radio free for 6 months! The dash is well laid out, attractive graphics. The message center provides easy to read, useful real time data. I like the ride and lack of road noise. For a compact, this car is quite comfortable. MPG!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In the first 3 months of ownership, I have been to the dealer 6 times for mechanical and body issues. The car frame was totally out of whack, the front end was not aligned, the driver side wiper flew off in a horrendous rain storm, the powertrain light comes on, the transmission kicks, starts in second gear, rarely can get up to speed. They fixed most of the body issues and the windshield wiper but the rest of the problems linger. No one can find anything wrong I am told but still the powertrain light is lit and performance is bad.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car for three reasons. 1-The 2005 Ford Minivan was excellent except for MPG. 2-The owner reviews on Edmunds were almost all favorable. 3-I fell in love with this model on the dealer's lot. It gets 26/36 MPG with AC on. 28/38 MPG with AC off. The mileage and pep went up after the first 1000 miles. The seats are very comfortable & my long legged son-in-law says the back seats are roomy enough. The tires, suspention entertainment & safety features are all top of the line in the SEL model that I bought. The color is a metalic gray with lots of chrome. I get complements every where I go on it.I am 76 years old & have owned 32 used & 10 new cars. This one is the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been a driver of a Ford Ranger for the last 18 years (2 different trucks). My driving needs changed in the last 6 months and I needed a car. I looked at many different vehicles, Mini Cooper, VW, BMW, GM, and Dodge. For the price, features, and performance to my needs the Focus was the best choice for me. I was very pleased upon getting in and out of the vehicle that it was at a comfortable level. Coming from a truck I didn't want the vehicle to be to low to the ground. The gas mileage has been great. I drive about 90 miles round trip to work now and it's a combination of highway and city driving. I've been getting over 34 mpg. The ability to use my iPod with the sync system is great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased for use as a well rounded, American made, economy car. I'm not a fan of GM, Toyota seemed too bland, Honda seats were too low. Other cars also seemed too high tech, which is fine, until the warranty is gone. Weight to power ratio is great, fun to drive, low maintenance. It's sporty, but certainly no sports car. However, if I wanted a hotrod, I would have purchased a hotrod. For what it is, the car is very well put together.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My recent purchase of the Focus was the right choice. On my first tank of mostly highway miles I got 40.4 mpg. Good power with the manual 5-speed. Satellite radio is a big bonus. Cruise control is steady and the overall ride is smooth. A great feature is the constant mpg reading that helps you ease up on the pedal to get optimal mileage. I test drove the Corolla, Aveo, Cobalt, Mazda 3, Yaris and Kia Rio. Ford focus has good looks, a solid engine and was the best bang for the buck. I highly recommend it!</TEXT>
