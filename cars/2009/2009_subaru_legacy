<TEXT>My wife and I love our Subaru Limited. We have had it for 3 months and no buyers remorse here. Handling - no comparison with other models in its class. Steering and overall comfort is wonderful. Test drove Altima, Accord and Sonata. Though the others each had their perks and overall better gas mileage, the AWD and wonderful drive sold it for us. 3-4 MPG less was not an issue with so many other nice features. The vehicle turns on a dime and handles great in the rain. I can't wait to see how it handles under winter conditions. The HK sound system is great too but was not a reason to buy. The car sold itself for us.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle handles like no other. This is the fourth "new" car I have owned, and it handles far better than any new car I have ever driven. I traded in my clunker...96 chevy tahoe with a 5.7 litre V8, so the 4 cylinder took a bit of getting used to, but as I get accustomed to the power, it is pretty snappy. Seats not too comfortable for long drives, but it's very easy and very fun to drive. I took it up to the Colorado mountains twice and it climbs with ease and handles those curves, above the speed limit, without so much as a mild screech. This vehicle is phenomenal, I love it, I recommend it to everyone. The elderly may find it too low to the ground, so it is with most "cars".</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior is gorgeous, mine is ivory (dangerous for stains) but contrasts with black carpet and metallic trim. Handling is superior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my Legacy for 1 year now and just love it. It's fun to drive and gets excellent highway miles. My first not a mom car...but it's a really cool grandma car. Whenever I mentioned wanting to get a Subaru to anyone they always had good things to say about them whereas when I'd mention possibly getting a different car they always had a nice car but... answers. We have owned 2 previous used Subaru's in the past and have gotten almost 300,000 miles on them. Expect to get many dependable years from my Legacy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the moon roof. Stereo sounds great...especially with the windows open. Sporty styling yet I can still haul 5 people when needed. Handles great. Love the fold down seats for extra hauling. We use ski pass to haul our fishing poles. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my Legacy for a few weeks now and have enjoyed driving it. It's not going to blow people away when the traffic lights change, but it's pretty nimble and responsive. It's a fun car to drive. The stereo is nice. The handling is excellent. It's quiet inside the cabin with very little wind or road noise. Gas mileage has hovered between 24 and 26 mixed city/highway driving and I got over 31 mpg on a trip up the interstate over Labor Day weekend. It's getting better gas mileage than I expected it would, which is an added bonus.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the whole package, but I find myself obsessing on the trip computer. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car back in May of this year because I was looking to trade in my 2006 Chevy Equinox which I hated, so I saw an advertisement on tv for Subaru and decided to check it out. I never owned a Subaru before so this was a new experience for me, once I got in it and test drove it there was no turning back. The car drives great, handles great, over all just a fun car. The HK audio system is incredible, those are the types of audio systems they put in much more expensive vehicles such as BMW. The only thing I don't like about this car is that it seems to pull to the right and the dealership told me that awd vehicles tend to do that. Not sure if anyone else has experienced this??</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>HK audio and really just about everything...I definitely would recommend a Subaru.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just got my Legacy a month ago and I could not be happier. We broke it in on a 3,000 mile trip to SC. It cruised through rain that had people pulling over because they could not see. We averaged 70 mph with the A/C on and the mileage was 31! Great safety with the 6 airbags and traction control. I have been told it had a 5 star rating. Great HK stereo, very quick with the 5 speed. Steering is precise and the roadholding is fantastic. I had two Audis and I like this more. Plus, if it did have a maintenance problem (which I don't think it will) it would be cheap to fix. A lot of car for 19K.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had this 1st time Subaru for 1 year and find that it is not comfortable for us older citizens. The passenger seat is very low and cannot be raised. Passenger has a difficult time exiting car because the car is set low and the seat is low. Driver, 5'11" & 175, is hard on the legs for the same reason. With seat lowered for driving comfort car it is difficult to enter and exit. MPG not up to rating for all in city driving. But, once inside the car is very good driving and fun to drive. We will go back to a Camry even though the price on the Subaru is terrific. No service problems in the year. Be sure seats are comfortable and park at a curb on your test drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2008 Toyota FJ Cruiser for this car, and I have been pleasantly surprised. It gets WAY better mileage than the FJ, which required premium gas. I took advantage of the smokin' $199/month lease that Subaru was offering, but I had never had one before. Needless to say, I was a little skeptical of just how good a Subie could possibly be, and I NEVER thought I would purchase one. All I knew was that they were equipped with all wheel drive, and there were many of them in Colorado. After my first test drive, I was sold! This car is every bit as good, and in most cases better than all the Toyota and Honda sedans I've owned. Better looks, handling, traction, interior, and comfort. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mileage - I've been getting about 23 city and 31 highway. Looks- sleek and timeless looks that won't get old anytime soon (I think it looks better than the 2010 model)! Interior instrument panel, gauges, and seat comfort - I'm a sucker for cool-looking red and blue lighting scheme. The stereo ROCKS!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My new Legacy 2.5i SE is our 6th Subaru and arguably the best. The car is the smoothest riding and shifting car I've ever owned. At the end of a long day there is nothing like my commute home in it (1/2 hour, city and country driving) to make me forget my day. Better still the fuel mileage is way better than I was expecting (about 29 MPG mixed driving conditions). The seats are really comfortable and the stereo is pretty awesome too. Even though the interior is a little smaller than comparable models, it fits around you giving you a nice blend of sport and luxury. Now I can't wait for wintertime driving and its AWD / traction control. Our other Subaru is 14 years old and we still love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth ride and shifting, plenty of power for this size car, well laid out instrument panel, comfortable seats, nice sound system, and really good gas mileage for an AWD vehicle. I like the front end and wheel styling as it gives a sporty appearance. The variable power steering is also great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my 2009 Legacy 3.0R with nav for almost three months now and I absolutely love it. Its 3.0 V6 is incredibly smooth and quick, the interior (mine is black leather) is gorgeous -it looks like a much more expensive car on the inside- and its exterior styling is unlike other cars. I love that you don't see many Legacys on the road. It makes them somewhat unique. The AWD, 18" rims, Bilstein shocks, paddle shifters, and SI Drive make it a performance sedan. Although it's a four-door, it doesn't feel like one on the inside. It sits low and is narrow. It's the perfect size. I do wish the car had more technology features like an improved nav system, proximity key, HID headlights, etc.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav system works well. Harman Kardon stereo sounds great (but read below). Electroluminescent gauges are easy to read. I love the exterior color (diamond gray metallic) and the 18" rims, and of course the AWD. Seat leather is high-end. SI Drive is fun. I have gotten so many compliments on the car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My sixth Subaru (79 and 87 wagons, 81 Brat, 95 Legacy, 03 Forester). Still have the Forester and Brat. Just picked up a 2009 Legacy 2.5i Limited-$21,800-and 2.9% financing. This is a good time to get the 09 models with the new 10's coming in. Initial impressions-firm but sporty ride, seats are hard (but I am coming from a very soft seat in a Ford Explorer), drove smoothly on the 125 mile trip back from the dealer. Nice sound system from the Harmon Karden stereo. Very similar in size to my old 95 Legacy -on the smaller size of the competition but my 6-year old fits fine in the backseat in her booster seat. 22.6mpg on the drive home but that should improve with time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Subaru--2 Legacys and one Outback. This is a company car that I drive daily and put over 40,000 miles on per year. To say the least, they have all been great cars. Zero problems with any of them. Between the 3, I've put over 200,000 miles on these cars-- not too bad. The AWD works great in wet weather. This is a very safe, very stable car. I wish the base engine had a little more spunk and wish the ipod input was on the dash instead of in the console. Other than that, buy one, change the oil every 7,500 miles and drive, drive, drive... Oh, and the gas mileage is great. I average 30+ MPG on the interstate with the cruise set between 75-78. </TEXT>

<TEXT>OK, so my clunker died and it was time for new wheels. I am a 35 year old man, and a father. I wanted something fun, sporty, comfy, and fun to drive. And I found it! I could not be happier with my Legacy 3.0R Limited. The car is a rocket, smooth as silk on the road, and is loaded with enough features to keep me busy for the next 6 months figuring them all out. Nav works well, although sometimes takes an odd turn or two. The car is a beauty, and accelerates better than any I have ever driven (and I test drive frequently as I am a car lover). This is a driver's car in every way, and Subaru deserves more street cred after making a machine like this one! I truly look forward to driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior is stylish and cool. Even the plastic feels and looks high class. Exterior is timeless and simple. My silver car with moonroof will turn heads.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had this car 4 months now and love it. My wife and I used to alternate driving our cars around town but now I drive everywhere. The car is getting the rated mileage unlike the Nissan Versa I traded in. I get about 21 mpg in 90% city driving and about 27 on the hwy. You'll be hard pressed to find a family sedan with AWD, a moon roof and this level of refinement for the price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The HK stereo is the best car stereo I've ever heard. Simple, elegant console layout that won't make you drive off the road trying to find a button. Comfy seats compared to my old Accord. Smooth handling & adequate power, I actually like the 4 speed AT. Very sharp exterior, & of course AWD.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We leased this car based on our positive experience with our 2008 Impreza Outback Sport. This 2009 Legacy Special Edition is an unbelievable value considering the TOP SAFETY ratings. This car has TOP IIHS safety ratings which is important to me for my college age daughter. THIS car handles and accelerates very well. It is EXTREMELY QUIET even at highway speeds. The four speed transmission is MORE than ADEQUATE regardless of what others have written. Highway gas mileage is above 30 mpg with City mileage ranging from 25-26 mpg. AWD, SAFETY, RELIABILITY (see Consumer Reports), Comfort, and STYLE make this car a TRUE winner in my opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car after a whole year of online research and test drives. Completely satisfied after a month of ownership. We needed a safe car for our 5-year-old twins, and the Legacy is definitely that. It's also a real pleasure to drive. The overall impression is that it's extremely solid, but also very agile (not an easy combination). Steering is just about perfect -- responsive and precise. The engine is smooth and has good torque. Visibility is great. Simple, no hassle driving and parking. Interior design is very handsome and oozes quality. Not a large car, but big enough for a family of 4. Superior value for the money. I'll post again after driving in winter conditions.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rugged feel combined with sharp handling. High quality construction. Attractive and driver-oriented interior. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>New Subaru owner</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>When I was forced to abandon ownership of my Jetta because no one in my town was talented enough to fix it - I looked at the Subaru. I live in the mountains in NC - and thought that AWD would be a good idea. I bought a 2009 Legacy (2.5 Special Edition issue). Although the "pick up" isn't quite like my Jetta - everything else more than surpasses my expectations and desires. My favorite part is the stability - in rain (no ice yet, but am waiting for winter), the car handles hazardous road conditions like a magnet on steel. I was amazed. I also love the stereo system - especially since I can plug in my iPod. Now I can listen to Stephanie Miller podcasts on my way to work. I love my Subaru! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite part - the handling. It's better than my Jetta and I don't have to put 19" tires on my car anymore!! I love it. Also - I'm like a lot of other folks ~ I get 34 mpg on the highway - which is mostly where I do my driving. Amazing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I would not recommend this car to anyone! The transmission shifts so roughly the entire car lurches, but the dealership insists it is fine. The seats are extremely uncomfortable - my back kills by the time I arrive at work!! The interior looks worn after only having the car for a few weeks. I purchased this car because I wanted an AWD vehicle and the price seemed good, but I regret every time I step foot in the car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven this car for the last 2 months and I love it. I owned an infiniti J30 and a cruddy 2000 maxima. The legacy GT handles like "it is on rails" and its probably just as good as BMW for half the price. The design of the car is humble and the interior is comfortable, I love the sound system and the way the seat feels. The navigation is not so high tech but it does work well. Bottom line this car is unique and is a awesome to drive, for those who "get it". You really need to drive one to understand. Infiniti, Lexus and BMW woo you with unnecessary options. Subaru is like an underground entity which only those with the brains over brawn will understand. BUY ONE.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The company I work for has a few Subarus, before I worked there I would have never thought about owning one. Now, I would not have it any other way. One of the office Subarus has over 220,000+ miles on it (99 Impreza,MT) & another has 130,000+ miles on it (05 Impreza,MT)I've driven the 05 "like I stole it" too. We change the oil and rotate the tires. I chose the Legacy, a little roomier than the Impreza. I also opted for the 5 speed MT, less overall ownership cost and I control the MPG a little more than the AT, not a computer. I don't understand the mileage rating from Subaru, I read other posts and several people have pointed out that these cars can get 32-36 mpg on the hwy. I do too!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sporty drive is GREAT!! The HK stereo is awesome for a factory option, the sun roof is great and the handling is excellent. Monarch Pass, Kenosha Pas, Vail Pass, anytime of year, no problem. Where most others in its class can't, this one does.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did a lot of research (both online and in person) before buying. Safety was a huge factor for me, so the great safety ratings and crash test results were a large part my decision. I ended up getting a 2009 Legacy Limited sedan. It handles very well. The 2009 has stability control standard. Feels pretty sporty around the curves. The AWD helps. The base engine has more than enough power for my driving habits. If you need more, get the turbo or 6 cylinder. The interior layout is great; very logical and oriented toward the driver. For a "family car" it's a fun car to drive. It's a little small compared to other midsized sedans, but is comfortable for average sized adults.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Harman Kardon stereo was a very nice touch. It sounds magnificent! The handling is nice and tight. Clean and logical cockpit layout. You don't see a ton of them on the road; which makes it a little unique.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is fantastic. I have not had a new car since 1997. I am cheap and the Legacy sold me at a very modest price. I have not looked back. This car is sleek, handles beautifully in this Ohio snow season, is comfortable, quiet, and has a great sound system. The peace of mind from the AWD + traction control is well worth the loss in miles. Plus, I don't drive all that much anyway to worry too much about 1 or 2 mpg. Hands down best car for the price. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked at purchasing a new car for about a year. Looked at Saturn Aura, Nissan Altima, Honda Accord Coupe. The Saturn was very nice but the build quality was not that great + I didn't know if the dealership would exist in the future. The Accord coupe rode very hard, the seats were very hard + the dashboard was too busy. Hadn't considered another Subaru (have a 2005 Outback 2.5i) until I determined I didn't like the Saturn or Honda. Drove the Forester (great!) then decided getting the Legacy was a no-brainer, given the reliability of my Outback. I gave the Outback to my wife & purchased the Legacy Limited. Now we both have no problems getting to our mountain top home in the winter! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased after several years of careful research. I have a 2006 Subaru Impreza. The two cars feel quite different in spite of only 200 lb more. The Impreza (non-turbo) feels very light and agile. The Legacy is much more solid and "mature". After 20 years of driving a stick shift I cannot immediately adjust from one to another. The stick shift is the way to go and still one needs to work the gears a little more on the Legacy. Sound isolation is better. On a recent trip I got 35 mpg highway at 65 mph with a loaded car with 3 adults and luggage and 33 mpg measured at the pump at 75 mpg. City is 23 - 25 mpg. Outstanding for AWD and any midsize. Extremely stable in snowstorms. Very happy with it</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD, excellent gas mileage for a midsize AWD car, handling, clean aerodynamic exterior design , logical and well appointed interior, good stereo, PZEV. Had to drive 200 miles at night in a severe snowstorm. It was faster and handled with more confidence than almost any truck and SUV on the road. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Spent around a year researching a new car. This was the perfect fit for what I wanted. It fits all of my practical needs but retains a lot of personality on the road. The AWD system is amazing. This car never loses its composure. The car drives through rain and snow without losing a beat. Then handling is also fantastic, without beating the passengers senseless. Getting about 25 mpg on average w/ a majority of city driving. Inside, the seats are firm and supportive, but comfy. The Harmon Kardon speakers sound great. I have no regrets on my purchase. Compared to Nissan Altima, Volvo S40, VW Passat, and Saab 9-3, this blew them all away. I'll probably be buying Subarus for a long time to come.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car! I spent 5+ years researching cars (hobby). I poured over reviews here, on the NHTSA complaints database and several other sites. The only serious complaint I read was about MPG. If you want MPG, don't get an AWD car. I challenge you to find a true AWD car with better MPG than this car. The AWD system is amazing now that they have VDC on it! I test drove an Audi A3 and A4, a Lexus IS 250 AWD, an Acura RL SH-AWD, a Volvo S40 AWD, and a Mercury Milan AWD. In winter driving, all of them had trouble engaging AWD fast enough on a packed snow turn and all struggled in fresh wet snow. The Legacy (and the new Impreza) had no problem. Love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a little over 600 miles on this car and so far I am very impressed. For the money this car is a steal. This car is a great alternative to Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Mazda because it is one of the safest cars on the road and because its AWD. For the money, you're getting a great car that you don't see too much on the road. It has many great features that are not standard on many cars costing this price. When I hear the name Subaru mentioned, I think of AWD, safety, reliability, quality, and performance. This is one of the nicest cars in this price range. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the AWD, excellent handling in all weather conditions, powerful four cylinder, great ride( balance of sport and luxury) comfortable seats, sport shift automatic, the Harmon Kardon Audio system is great, impressive fuel economy especially when you drive the highway.

I am VERY happy with this car and I can't wait to drive it in the Michigan winters! I am extremely happy with my first Subaru.

<TEXT>As enthusiastic as I was about getting a new Legacy, my expectations were exceeded. Interior quality and styling is far superior to anything in its class and many in a higher class. Though the cockpit is a bit narrower than most, I'm still very comfortable despite my overly padded body (I'm working on getting the weight off). Mileage in the mid 20s (50-50 city/highway) but with just a few hundred miles on it I expect the numbers will rise. Handling and ride are great and then there's the amazing level of equipment for the price. Where on earth can you get a great handling awd mid size with leather, moonroof, XM, HK stereo, vdc, and the usual power accessories for just 23K. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gorgeous interior with great ergonomics and equipment. Ride and handling are first rate. Love the input jack which provides me with the pleasure of my iPod jazz collection.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought a 2009 legacy 2.5i special edition. I love the car a lot. It's a lot of fun to drive. The best feature on the car is the AWD. In poor weather you feel safe and steady on the road. I love the feel of the interior space. The car comes with a lot of features stock that other companies would charge extra for.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car suit my needs well. 4DR sedan with AWD, enough power, comfortable ride. It has all the features that I need, plus a moon roof that I did not really need (standard on 3.0R). All that for around $25k price tag was acceptable. I don't make much use of SI drive. I leave it on Sport mode, and take it easy on the throttle instead of making the computer do it for me. That way, I get fuel economy and throttle response also when needed. The MPG gauge does not show much of a difference unless I use low gear acceleration with Sport mode. Score of 6 for fuel economy is fair. Any worse then 17 city and 24 highway then I would not have considered this car, and the estimate seems accurate.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD. Not just because it's AWD, but also how it works. It behaves closer to a RWD. It sends more torque to the rear wheel from what I've read, and it feels like it. The HK speakers sound good, and the cabin is quiet enough to enjoy music, even at highway speed. V6 engine is quiet enough. Valet key. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my third legacy and first on in 8 years. Coming from an 06 Acura TL, I thought the handling would not be up to par, but it is a significant upgrade with better control at higher speeds. The ride is firm, but not bouncy. Obviously the four cylinder could use more power or even better another gear or two in the automatic. Fuel economy is about 25mpg with about 30% city driving. The Harmon Kardon sound system blows away the premium system in the Acura. Perfectly clear at all volume levels all the way to the max. Subaru was the only answer since we only purchase Subaru, Honda, and Toyota products and we wanted an AWD car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system rocks, plays mp3/wma discs and has audio jack for iPod. AWD. Great handling</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have not yet recorded 900 miles on my '09 Legacy 2.5i Limited, and I am very happy with my decision. It handles better than any car I've owned, looks better, and is more refined interior for less money than any of the other sedans I tested. Subaru has a reputation for being an incredibly safe vehicle and that meant a lot to me. This is my first Subaru, but I hope not my last.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the Yokohama performance all season radials. The Harmon/Kardon premium 6 disc mp3 player. The leather interior, and the look of the exterior. The sportshift is cool. I love the boxer engine and dual exhaust. Moonroof, dual climate control, huge glove box, heated ext mirrors and wipers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in my '05 mdx for the Subaru. I must say its fantastic! What a car! Performance is outstanding. The ride is super smooth, and the handling is fantastic. I really can't say anything bad about Subaru. This is the best sedan by far I have ever owned!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th Legacy, and by far the best one yet. The new Harmon Kardon stereo upgrade rocks, and the car is so much value for the money! It feels solid and tight in any conditions, handles amazingly (the test drive will make you buy this car!) and when you look at the sticker price compared to similar European makes costing much more, it makes you feel smart and lucky. Wish it had Bluetooth, love the new music and cruise control buttons on the wheel, would like more ambient lighting inside (which the Germans do to great effect). Elegant but not fussy, this car is comfortable, fun, sporty and luxurious all at the same time. Simplicity of design still works and defines a nice car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice leather, nice stereo,high quality performance tires, moonroof and most of all the Subaru S-AWD feeling of surefooted control.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>An excellent, smooth ride. Stable, very little body roll even when accelerating into turns. Instrument panel and console layout well done. Smooth acceleration, smooth stops. Originally considered SE but the Limited boasts a lot of features that more than justify the increase in cost, though both trims drive exactly the same. Seats are comfortable, power seats & telescoping/tilt wheel easy to find your sweet spot in the driver's seat. The 2.5 4-cylinder is more than enough power. If you are considering a mid-size sedan, the safety features of this Subaru more than make up for the sacrifice of a few MPG with a FWD/RWD car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Automatic transmission with Sportshift (Tiptronic), Heated mirrors & front windshield, all wheel drive, beautiful instrument cluster & console configuration, alloy rims standard, dual zone climate control.</FAVORITE>
