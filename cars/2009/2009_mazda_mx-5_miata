<TEXT>We bought the car as a weekend fun car and what fun it is! It is getting colder in the North East now, but I intend to squeeze out every last day of top down driving that I can. Love the way the engine growls and how it handles overall. Not nearly as much fun with the top up. Would love to take a really long top down drive but alas I may have to wait until next spring to do so. If you live in a year round warm climate, buy this car! If you don't no worries, cover it up in the winter and you will enjoy it that much more come spring time. b/t/w I am 6 feet tall with long legs and I don't find the car to be uncomfortable at all. I truly love my MX-5. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The PRHT is so eazy and fast, and I love that it does not take up your trunk space. Manual shift is quick and responsive. Auto temp control, the red dash lights, overall look (gets alot of attention), love just about every little feature. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In a word this car is FUN! and you can't beat the price or the fuel economy 25MPG (Measured over a year). It drives like a dream, it's fun to watch people look at the car and smile, it's fun to take corners at high speed, it's fun to listen to the great stereo with the top down and the wind in your hair while singing at the top of your voice. Zoom-Zoom!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling, the new "Credit Card" like key that you can leave in your pocket and never take out. The great reliability NO problems with this car and this is my 3rd Mazda and my 2nd Miata</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I too had a 2007 PHT Miata, when I saw the 2009's I thought ok don?t know about the smiley face look but I will go look at one. Well I went to the dealer and test drove one and wow big improvement over my 2007, tighter suspension, the seats are great, the stereo with MP3, Bluetooth, seat adjuster, my husband fit in it and more, I loved it. My husband has an S2000 and mustang and he loved this car too, it may not be as fast or sporty as his, but then it was not made to compete with those cars in that class, but I find it more fun then his, this car was made for pure fun and enjoyment and that is what it is. I have it now for 3 weeks and that smiley face is now on my face everyday. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Anyone who has driven a Miata will come away with a smile. But often someone will come along and bash the car comparing it to cars costing $10K more (S2000) or twice as much (Boxter). It is unrealistic to expect Porsche performance at the Miata's selling price of around $25k (sport model). The MX-5 really sits by itself in the marketplace of low-price performance convertibles. Drive one. If you come away with a smile, then buy it and let the fun begin. I can't stop thinking about the next time I'll drive the car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty, great handling, light weight, just enough power to prevent me from getting tickets, great shifter in the 6MT.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bottom line: this car is in undeniably fun to drive. Top down, wind in the hair, and a pure feeling of freedom. Hell, why was I not doing this years ago? Not sure about every convertible out there, but this sure seems like the best damn one out there. And how do you beat the price--or the numerous accolades the Miata has one. To be succinct: I love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased a 2009 MX5 Grand Touring PRHT with the optional suspension & premium package, and I love it.The top goes down in 12 seconds and the 6M with limited slip differential makes it a true driver sports car.When it comes to interior it stands alone in its class,the exterior has 20 years of evolution making it one of the best looking roadsters on the road. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Silky smooth 6 speed transmission,sexy PRHT 12 seconds open close time,suspension package/Bilstein shocks with limited slip-DSC WITH TRACTION CONTROL, great gas mileage</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great car. It exhibits the critical balance between performance, style and comfort, while maintaining a true sports car feel. This car invites you to drive it - it is so much at home on a winding road with the top down - it delivers just what the car was designed to do - a oneness with the road and a fun factor that is off scale. The 6 speed transmission is a joy, the audio system sounds great, the top up / down operation is effortless and the car has great visual appeal. Test drive one - you will love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The overall fun factor of just driving the car. This car makes you think you are on vacation every day!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drove an '09 on a whim, didn't think I'd buy as I loved my 07 Grand Touring PRHT. I was wrong. As soon as I took the test drive I could tell the seemingly minor changes had made a great car even, well, greater. Red line is up to 7200, so less hitting the rev limiter when winding it out. Engine and tranny just seem stronger and smoother, although the published numbers are basically unchanged. 6M shifts seem even tighter and shorter if that's possible. Must have been exhaust tweaks because it sounds even better. Interior also seems roomier, the door cup holder has been redesigned and no longer protrudes into your leg. Love that! Traded my 07 on the spot and drove the 09 home.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Higher redline and overall drivetrain and interior tweaks. Super reliability based on my 99 and 07 Miatas, never a single problem. Got Homelink, Bluetooth phone, keyless, and TPM. Price undercuts base Z4/Boxster by $25K or the Z4 Turbo/Boxster S by 35K. Cash in my pocket. Low cost of ownership.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought my first convertible in aug of 08 which was a Saturn sky, hated it! Now I have a 09 phrt mx5, love it! I have a trunk and I can put the top up & down in 12 seconds. The sky's top was very hard to get down if you are a woman. The sky is a sharp looking car, but in my opinion my miata is the bomb! Sky rated a 5. Mx5 rated 10+ with me! </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Made a big mistake</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Have owned real sports cars (vetts, S2000, porsches) downsized to this, with such great reviews got this thought my wife would also like it, terrible ride not even closed to the handling of an S2000. I not talking about raw power, but handling, how can anyone call this a sports car WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT will sell as soon as I can. If you want to save a few dollars buy a used S2000 or Boxster you will be driving a real sports car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first car I've had in living memory that my wife actually wanted to drive whenever she goes anywhere that doesn't require a large trunk. As my son put it, it feels like you're going fast even when you're not. It's just fun to drive no matter what kind of driving you're doing. My first sports car was an MG Midget, which began to disintegrate as I left the dealership. It was great fun to drive, when it would start and it wasn't raining, but living in Baton Rouge that wasn't often. One thing I know about the Miata is that it doesn't leak. Also, it gets surprisingly good gas mileage for the kind of driving that I do. Loads of fun, and I love the design. I even like the grill changes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've had the new 09 Miata for about two weeks now. I'm an experienced technical review of video gear, so I'm trying to apply those skills here. The MX-5 is exactly what a fun roadster should be, but was lacking till the introduction of the Miata in 1989. It holds the road beautifully and has just the right amount of power for what this car is supposed to be - a fun way to travel on a nice day. The engineering design seems very well thought out and offers opportunity to the experienced driver and user- friendliness and intuitiveness to the new roadster enthusiast. It is an amazing car and I love driving it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is extremely fun to drive. Grips in the corners and gives you great feedback. Would love if they put a turbo charger on it, but the 4 cyl engine still pulls nicely. I test drove both the manual and auto 6sp. I ended up with the automatic because it shifts quickly at near redline when driving spiritedly, and I do more highway driving and did not want the suspension package that was on most of the 6sp manuals.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Road handling characteristics. This car does what ever you tell it too. Simply fun to drive</FAVORITE>
