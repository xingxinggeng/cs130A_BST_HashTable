<TEXT>I've owned my Forester for 10 months, 11K miles on it and I'm considering a trade in. While this vehicle is exactly what I want in a car as a small SUV and I enjoy driving the car at times, overall the poor quality of the workmanship of the car makes me regret my purchase. I've had the car in for both a major repair (power steering replacement) and major annoyances (mystery noises from door panels, rear-door catch had to be re- welded, and buzzing noises from stereo). Honestly, I miss my 7 year old 125K car I traded in because that car had less body noise and rattling than this brand new car. I'm severely disappointed in the quality of this car and I am considering cutting my losses now.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Ipod Interface to the stereo is great if you are a tech & music lover. I love the roomy interior and style. For its size it gets good fuel economy. I recommend the all weather floor mats & trunk mat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Finally a car with enough headroom without sitting on the ground! I'm 6'5 and I sit with the seat straight up and my head does not hit the ceiling. Wife is 4'11 and passenger seat is way too low. Before you buy know this, 09 foresters have been consistently having rattling problems. No fix in sight other than tearing out the interior and doing a custom job. By rattling I mean pull your hair out mad that your new car sounds like rattling. Am totally shocked by this but wow the headroom.</TEXT>

<TEXT>AWD is flawless. Pulls my boat out of water with ease!! Quiet interior at 70 mph. I tried several small SUVs, none drove in a solid controlled way. It challenges my BMW 323. With 3000 miles, I'm averaging 26 mpg total, includes 60% city/40% highway. Pulls utility trailer with ease. Simple interior controls are breath of fresh air. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable seats, passenger seat could be higher. AWD is well done!! MPG very acceptable, simple interior controls, excellent space with rear seats down. Nice compass, temp and mileage display. Love this vehicle!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First time Subaru owner; may go back to Toyota. Two months after the purchase felt like wheels were spinning on two occasions. Finally at 15k transmission is gone. Dealer wanted to charge $90 for transmission flush. Threatened them to call Subaru of America and only then they agreed to replace tranny for new one. A/C had intermittent problem that showed up shortly after I bought it. Had to get Subaru of America involved to get dealer to provide loaner car and keep the Forester overnight to try to duplicate problem. Disappointed with the service received at dealership for a fairly new car under warranty. Makes me wonder what's next? Wife thinks I bought a "LEMON". Have Subaru phone # on hand.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2009 Subaru Forester 2.5 X, Auto. This is my first Subaru. While I really like my AWD wagon. Subaru needs to up their game. The drivers seat has broken twice in less than 4000 miles. It took two weeks to get a new frame. A long time. Tech stated that Subaru has known about this problem for awhile. Yet they gave me another seat frame that broke in about one week. I am now waiting for another seat frame. Why couldn't I buy a drivers power seat without spending $4000 extra. Now I wish I had. This may be last Subaru.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I switched from a Volvo V70 front wheel drive because I wanted the the advantages of AWD in snow and icy conditions. I had previously owned a Volkswagen Passat with AWD (same system at the time as Audi Quattro) and I considered getting an Audi Quattro station wagon, but the ground clearance was a limitation in deep snow. So far, after 11 000 km. very happy with this car. BUT: I live in Europe, bought the car with the new Boxer Diesel: 147 hp. 256 ft./lb. torque, 6 speed manual tranny and, absolutely no kidding: 43 mpg. highway mileage. Why don't you guys in the States demand to get in on the real action with this car?</TEXT>

<TEXT>7 mo/7000 miles, so far so good. Almost bought a RAV4 V6, but didn't like paying extra for accessories and hated RAV4 looks. However, would have bought a V6 Forester if available vs turbo-4cyl. While the car is fun, sometimes it seems it can't decide whether to downshift or use turbo, so performance is jerky with some lag at times. Could be due to 4spd auto tranny (or my driving style, which is avg to a little aggressive). MPG is ok, 20-23mpg avg, with up to 25 seen during a recent 1000 mile trip. I installed aftermarket oil temp and turbo gauge b/c I like to be more informed about engine status vs silly idiot lights. However, I still think its the best small SUV on the market, no regrets.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the XT for one year now, 14,000 miles, and like it a lot. Nothing has gone wrong. Ride comfort is excellent, very fun and nimble to drive, gas mileage OK at 22.2 overall. Would have liked a finer quality interior. I made the front seats comfortable with memory-foam seat cushions topped by sheepskin covers. Love the cargo space and visibility, turning circle, cornering ability, power. So far, so good!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned my Forester almost a year now. It's not sexy but it's extremely practical. It's been an absolute pleasure to drive and own. I live in CO so it's been tested in snow, ice, mountains, dirt roads, etc. No problems. The 4 speed auto could be a big problem in mountain driving except the sport shift feature makes it into an easy to use manual transmission! I've averaged 26.1 MPG since owning it, much better than anticipated. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 6th Subaru, but in between I've owned Toyotas and Chevys. Before Subaru I've owned just about all makes of mid-priced cars. This Forester (my 4th) has great styling, a comfortable well put together interior, and best of all, full time AWD. Once you own a Subaru you always wonder why you'd buy anything else. The cars starts easily, drives flawlessly and is greatly admired by people at work and on the street. A black Forester with black leather and dark tinted windows is one classy ride. Storage room is great, the stereo system is clear and easy to use and the huge sunroof is a pleasure. One thing I do know... all future cars for me will start with the word Subaru!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car after extensive research and what a thrill to have after almost 10 years. Everything was great for about 450 miles when back end started rattling. Dealer had it 5 days and couldn?t fix it or trade, Subaru wouldn?t cover it because it?s a ?normal condition? of this vehicle but thanked me for bringing it to their attention so that "even though this is of no comfort to you," others may not have to experience the same defects. At 6K miles began rattling in back end, right front door, glove compartment, dashboard, in the roof. Mileage at 18/23 is also disappointing and at now having power steering problems. It?s now on the market, live and learn! Wipers work great</TEXT>

<TEXT>I don't know about any of you but this vehicle is a rattle trap. Drove off lot with 11 miles and was already rattling from multiple locations. My wife wishes she had her 05 Forester back. Love the exterior styling of this vehicle and like the ride, however they really skimped with quality of interior trim. Cannot get past the rattles & vibration. Vehicle has 415 miles and dealer fixed most rattles except the hatch vibration over bumps. I cannot live with spending $26k for a Forester that rattles. Luckily the dealership is allowing me to return it for 100% refund and get an Outback. The Outback is a much superior vehicle. One other note, two loaner 09 Foresters also rattled.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We compared the CRV, Rav4, and Torrent. Subaru was in 3rd place until 2009's redesign. After checking out the available features, it was our top choice. It was the best car for my wife in terms of entering and exiting. The leather seats are comfortable and supportive. Drives great. Average 26 mpg, only 1000 miles so far. The climate control system is great, set it and forget it. This is our first AWD car and our first Subaru, but I'm sold. It drives like a car. There is plenty of space, and according to friends who rode in the back seat, we made the right choice. We have had a number of compliments on the car since we purchased it. It was the right choice for us.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The heated leather seats, moon roof, climate control, and drive. It is very comfortable compared to the others we tested. The road noise is minimal up to 65 mph. Plenty of space. Extra leg room in back seat. All weather package. Great car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Upgraded from a 2003 Focus station wagon with leather and moon roof ? I was looking for something practical, competent and reliable. Found it in the spacious Forester. Just would have wished road feel less SUV. Nevertheless, the Forester beats its competitors? handling and demeanor. So far drove 900 miles in city and on a trip to Texas Hill Country. 3 adults plus driver very pleased with comfort during 5 hours road trip. Noise level remains low under 80 mph. AWD shines on wet roads. AC is more than sufficient for Texan heat. Lots of goodies for colder climates. Positively surprised by fuel consumption (comparable to old Focus). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design and assembly quality. Large moon-roof (remains and quite unless fully opened). Supportive driver seat and room (I am 6?2). Cruising range. Power and transmission beating old Focus. Manual gear control. Rear seats? room, armrests and cup holders. Sound of stereo in SRS mode.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It was time to replace my '95 Legacy Sedan with 225K plus miles on it. This vehicle was indestructible, but I fell in love with the new Forester. I also considered a new Saab 93 XWD Turbo and Volvo Cross Country. Both vehicles are absolutely beautiful, but it seems like different parts of these vehicles are made in different parts of the world. I love my new Forester with a turbo engine. It's a dream come true. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>100% Japanese: engine, transmission, final assembly... you can't go wrong with that, huge moonroof, fun to drive, a lot of visibility, roomy, beautiful black leather interior, gauges are simple and easy to use, perfect for my two kayaks.

<TEXT>Like most people today we did a lot of on-line comparison shopping looking for a new car. After several weeks we decided on the Subaru Forester and we are more than happy with our choice. The car is ultra quiet. At an idle I could barely make out the engine noise at all. on the road and at speed the Forester is amazing quiet except if you roll a window down. With the automatic fuel consumption/ miles per hour monitor you can see the gas mileage you are getting. We did a side by side comparison of driving with and without the cruise control. We are now big believers in cruise control even for short jaunts. The interior is more than roomy and has lots of over head space for my 6'4" frame. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I don't want to offend all the Subie cultists out there, but what are they smoking! Spare yourself the agony of shelling out $28 grand for this overpriced tinker toy. All the reviews I've read sound like they came from Subaru employees. The ride is bad and noisy over 35 mph and off residential streets. The non turbo 4 cyl - 4 speed downshifts constantly when trying to enter the interstate or climb a small grade, almost got creamed by an 18 wheeler. Seats hurt if you drive over 1 hour,cheap thin sheet metal, interior materials, noise from the back storage bins when hit bumps. Only had 3 months - someone hit my door with theirs, made golfball size dent, didn't happen on my American SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car (more of a cross-over with the re-design)is beyond my expectations. Every person we know who owns a Subaru stands behind it's quality and performance. I fell in love with the new look and the all-wheel drive for less than $25k. There is lots of room in back for the infant seat and my husband enjoys the all-weather package. I also treasure the car-like trunk as I found that mini-vans had a lot of vertical space but not enough horizontal space for grocery bags and trips to the home improvement store. Already getting better mileage than my former V-6 two door coupe!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Previously owned four Outbacks. They are a more substantial vehicle with many more standard feature details such as lighted vanity mirrors, bumper cover, cargo tray, cargo cover, fog lights, all weather package, etc, Outback has better seats, quieter ride, better handling, power drivers seat, better interior materials, more solid construction. Outback has a higher sticker price but Forester is about the same when similarly equipped. After 3-years Outback is rattle/squeak free and solid. Forester already has suspension noises and dash rattle over rough surfaces after only 800 miles. Tried all the competitors before buying this one and overall it's the best of small SUVs but Outback is better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a crossover? A station wagon? An SUV? How about just fun, economical, safe or FES! This 2009 Forester is far and above what is available out there dollar for dollar. After 2700 miles, with a average of 24 mpg combined (highest being 31 mpg on the highway) the only complaint I have is no coin holder. Drove the others, then test drove the Subaru all the way home. Kept it overnight, drove it back to the dealership and paid them for it. Power is available at request, auto tranny is fine but I like the sport shift and it drives knowing where you need to go before you do. Simple dash easy to use and with plenty of head room front and back seats. Nice job Subaru you got it right.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Picked up a 09 2.5X Premium with All weather package and 5 Spd. Really wanted dark interior. But dealer didn't have any with stick shift. Averaging 21.5 mpg in town driving fairly aggressive. I do enjoy driving this. This car is definitely the benchmark in the small SUV category. This car is fun to drive, and hopefully as reliable as previous Foresters. I would of never considered purchasing a Forester, until this new model came out. Being a single guy in my mid 20s, I do get a little crap for it looking like a "soccer mom" mobile.</TEXT>

Then I saw an ad for the new 2009 Forester, at first I thought who the heck drives a Subaru? Out of desperation I went to the Subaru dealership sat down in the LL Bean addition and fell in love! Right away you realized how much roomier the Forester was than other small SUVs and the lumbar support was great for my back. I took it for a test drive and was sold. It handled great (love the AWD) the moon roof was huge! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Went through the usual comparisons and narrowed it down to the Forrester XT and the Rav 4 six cylinder. Living at altitude in CO, I wanted an SUV that had some power to easily get up steep grades. I liked the look of the Forrester and the fact that the Subbie AWD felt superior to Toyota's 4WD. Of course the safety features also helped. Bought the Forrester and have 800 miles on it so far. No regrets at all. The turbo is a blast, the car rides extremely smooth and it looks great in Dark Gray Metallic. The only sacrifice is the extra cash for premium gas... which I balanced out by quitting lattes. I've been getting 24 MPG in mixed driving which is better than most SUVs. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After exhaustive test drives and visits to a variety of dealerships, two small suvs stood out. The new Ravs are nice, especially the 6 cylinder, but the 2009 Subie XT was the ticket. Had to drive over 100 miles to get the color (sage green) we wanted. This car is fun-fun to drive. It will go fast, like changing lanes and passing 18 wheelers in a less than 3 seconds. Our 2002 Rav could only try. Fit/finish is up to the toyota standards and thats good. But the ergonomics are much better. All around visibility is great. Tight U-turner.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It has power to spare. 224 hp in such a small package is crazy. Handling is very nimble. You've got to keep the steering wheel aimed the right direction as you can often go faster than expected. The brakes (4 discs) also do a good job of slowing you down. Rear seating is great but only for two. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned Nissan Sentra before this Subaru-expected big difference; can't compare with other SUVs like CRV and RAV4 because I didn't test-drive them (my mistake,just relied on reviews). Murano has more power (the price is too much though), but Forester is quieter. After about 2 weeks of use, I started hearing this annoying rattle by the dashboard. I also hear a "thug" in the back (right side) the moment it runs after parking. I will have the dealership look into it. It's frustrating to get stuck with the noise for years. Also, I've been reading great MPG from owners; the highest I've got so far is 18.3-based from the dashboard monitor, mostly highway 60-65 mph.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought the 2009 Subaru Forester and am amazed. The interior quality is great. There are no rattles. All the body panels fit together tightly. The driver has excellent visibility of the road and the moon roof is huge. Exterior: The new Subaru now looks much more like an SUV. It's off-road performance greatly exceeds its competitors like the Honda CRV and Ford Escape. It is willing to go wherever you point if. I've averaged between 28-31 MPG on the highway and 22-24 in town. The 4 speed automatic is a bit slow to down shift, but not a problem as you can do it manually with the shiftronic. The 2009 Subaru Forester is a winner</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were so excited about getting the Forester - great headroom, legroom. We purchased it yesterday and went for our first day trip today. THE SEATS ARE SO SO SO UNCOMFORTABLE. I stopped at one point to lay out on a picnic table at a park along the road. Zero lumbar support...goofy headrest pointed the wrong way, and knees higher than your rump - all the pressure goes to your low back. I am absolutely so so sad I'm stuck with such miserable seats in what seems to be a nice (otherwise) car. I'm young, not overweight, and in good health - and these seats are absolutely awful.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought XT Limited this primarily for my wife, who had been nursing along a 2001 Jeep Cherokee Laredo with 130K+ miles. The new Subie is a pleasant driving experience! The turbo provides a distinct but not overpowering reminder that this Forester is no longer a narcoleptic Sunday drive with Aunt Millie and Uncle Olaf. Plenty of room. I'm 6-2, and there's still headroom. Our 2 boys like the moon-roof. The 09 Forester is wider, longer, and taller, making it larger than other "small" SUVs, and very close to what I expect from mid-SUVs I have to laugh - the coffee-cup holder is still flimsy and cheap looking - just like in all Subarus, including our '99 Sub Outback wagon. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Basically, the new 2009 Forrester has everything I can get from mid-sized SUV, incl (with the turbo), a horsepower-to weight ratio that makes this a LOT more fun to drive. And, unlike the mid-sized SUVs, the Forester mileage is avg 25 city/hwy. I love the "puddle lights" & backlit blue dash.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I researched all of the good gas mileage SUVs and test drove the Toyota Highlander, Nissan Murano, Honda CRV, and Toyota RAV4. The Subaru Forester was my favorite. I have 2000 miles on it so far and I am extremely pleased. The Turbo is very fast with no lag on the highway and some lag from standing stops. The ride is smooth and the handling is car like. Cargo storage is great with many different tie down options. The interior controls are very simple. The gas mileage is better than I thought. I am getting 27 mpg on the highway with speeds 65 MPH or under. The gas mileage goes down to 24 mpg at highway speeds of 75 mph. I love the tight turning circle. Very little road noise</TEXT>

Very car-like and corners well with the stability control. I'm getting 26 MPG average so far. You can't beat that for an AWD SUV. The sunroof is huge! My biggest complaint so far is on the highway I was behind an 18 wheeler and I was pulled a bit from the wind difference. But that's it. I love this car and I am very happy with it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Only 300 miles, but here are first impressions. Would rather have V6 than turbo due to premium gas. Arm rest are very low on left side, unsecure on right side. Would love better seat adjustments. Move panic button from back of key to front, I always seem to hit it when I'm unlocking the hatch. It is fun to drive. Road noise is pretty loud at hwy speed. Love the room! Much better than others After test driving almost everything, Honda CRV, Toyota RAV4, MBenz Mclass, Acura, this was the best choice. The Acura has more comfortable seats and armrest for tall people like me, but cost $15K more. Just couldn't justify. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After countless research on this size of vehicle, we felt Subaru was the only way to go. Love this car, Except for the extremely hard seats (leather). Test drive was short and sweet so we didn't notice how uncomfortable they were. I have severe back trouble and this has put me in a horrible flare-up, after only driving 6 miles home from the dealership. Called the following morning and told of medical situation, and could we please bring the car back as I will have to stay with a mini-van. They would buy the car back at at $7000 loss (pretty steep for 6 miles). So, we are having the seats rebuilt, if this is of no help, then the car will have to go. Please beware of seat comfort.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched several comparable models and chose a 2009 Forester having consideres Forester for a couple of years, The 2009 model is a step forward from the excellent previous Forester. This car handles beautifully and is a joy to drive. It has more room than the previus model yet maintains the Forester image. Gas mileage has been as high as 32 highway at 60 mph. Fit and finish is excellent. I am thrilled with my new 2009 Forester. Would recommend the Rugged Package which includes side moldings, fender moldings, roof rack bars and rear bumper protector.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I can't believe all the hoopla about the ride comfort of this vehicle. I have had mine for a month and recently took it on it's first interstate trip. The ride quality was poor at best - deafening road noise where 2 of us in the front seats had to shout at each other constantly in addition to picking up every tar crack or road imperfection. Also exhibited wind noise at 55 MPH. As for the performance, the little 4 cylinder was constantly shifting and loud with every little grade we encountered. I'm not talking about hills here. Maybe its the cheap Yokohama tires or they forgot to put insulation in mine. My 05 Merc Mountaineer on a truck frame was better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought ours yesterday and were sold from the minute we sat in it. We were comparing between a CRV exl a BMW x3 and a lr2. The Forester handled the best, had the most options for the most reasonable lease price and our sales rep at irvine Subaru was second to none. We ultimately chose to go with the Subaru because of the overall quality of the vehicle and the person we dealt with.</TEXT>

<TEXT> Recently traded in our 1997 Ford Explorer due to age and recent repairs. Researched all vehicles in the compact/midsized SUV Class. Drove the Nissan Rogue ,Honda CRV, Toyota RAV4. Then drove the Forester. The Forester has an exceptional amount of cargo and passenger room for a "small" SUV. The vehicle handles great due to standard all-wheel drive. We did have leather installed because the only drawback was the cloth seats did not feel very comfortable. I would highly recommend this vehicle because of the great gas mileage (27 > on highway, and 26 combined) and the multitude of safety features. The Swiss Army Knife of all vehicles! Great value, performance, and reliability!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've had small SUVs/CUVs since the first ones came onto the scene. This time it was between newest CR-V, Outlander, or Forester. Didn't like weird styling which sacrificed utility/visibility on new CR-V, couldn't find right color/options/price combo on Outlander, but we instantly loved the simple, stylish, and useful design of the new Forester. Even in "base" trim, has the features you need and many you'll want -- all at a great price. Peppier with manual shift, and improved in every way. Great interior room and visibility, nice style inside and out. More mainstream than ever, but better for it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just took possession of a 2009 Subaru Limited edition (non turbo). The interior space is far superior to my 2001 Subaru Forester. The "fit and finish" are a step up--still a little plastic, though. Engine is adequate to good, with some pep (but not extra- ordinary speed or handling). Nearly bought a Toyota V-6 Rav 4 which drove a little better, but the extra cost (nearly 3000 dollars) and the smaller interior for me (I am over 6 feet tall) made the Subaru the choice. Looking for 8-10 good years from this vehicle, a good choice for a safe, reliable, practical car that drives quite well in the snow and can handle two small kids and one dog. See you in the mountains of West Virginia!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior vastly improved on vehicle. Moonroof a big hit with the kids. Driver controls improved and still familiar. Great visibility and a lot of headroom for taller drivers. Comfortable seats and the leather feels like it is good quality. Not as boxy/quirky as the older model, better rounded.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looked at everything from the new Maxima, Ford Flex,CRV,CX9 etc., name it I probably drove it. Went to the Subie dealer about three months ago, test drove all the above after my Subie dealer visit and measured price per feature, performance,safety, durability and cost(overall value). Each time the Subaru Forester XT Limited came back to the top and I went to drive again. Having owned several in Colorado, and took them all over 200K this Newport Blue Pearl became an easy choice with Consumer Reports recommended list pushing me along. The Turbo is not push you in the back of the seat turbo, just an "oh my gosh" I am at 60mph already turbo. Traded my Honda in for it and never looked back. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats very comfortable-HEAD ROOM YEA! (I am 6'2")-flexibility in all types of weather(AWD),internal seating configurations and drives like a bigger car with control.

<TEXT>If you are short (5'3") you may have trouble with the brake pedal - it's very soft and high, and if you try to rest your foot on it (like us shorties have to), it starts to brake immediately - very hard on your legs! And just 2600 miles on it, on a long road trip, the cruise control just stopped working, the "cruise control" warning light started blinking, the "traction control OFF" light came on, and the "check engine light" came on - can't bring in until next week - heaven knows what is going on - still had 300 miles to get home with car loaded with kids and gear.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As a first time Subaru customer, I purchased this Forester on 6/30/08, after reading all of the reviews here, as well as on other websites. My wife and I traveled from Columbus, OH to Cleveland, OH (140 miles), with luggage and the A/C on, this past weekend, and averaged 29.1 mpg! We picked up my in-laws and their luggage and drove to Rome, NY, (an additional 370 miles) again with the A/C on, and for that portion of the trip, as well as the return trip, we averaged 28.2 mpg's! Now you know why I'm ecstatic - this Forester isn't even broken in, and it's getting excellent fuel efficiency. By the way, our Subaru is a PZEV (partial zero emissions vehicle).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very pleased with this vehicle. I went from a Jeep to the Subaru and couldn't be happier. The utility of this vehicle is incredible and its most important function. The vehicle rides, drives, operates great. I have averaged no less than 28 mpg in mixed driving (50/50). I would recommend anyone needing something more than a car, but less than a giant SUV take a look! The turbo would have been nice, but out of my $ range, and sacrificing efficiency may not have been worth the performance - I can buy a motorcycle for those days. That said the non-turbo does great!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Forester. I have loved the 2004 XS all-wheel drive, 4-disc brakes, the feel of quality, maneuverability, crash test safety, and practicality of a hatchback to haul or carrying stuff. (I love the XT, but it uses premium gas, so I avoided it in both cars). The 2009 is more elegant, taller, more room, adds the new "VDC" rollover safety feature, has the SportShift autoshifter, better visibility, more airbag protection,and still has that Subaru quality. I have owned Toyotas, Hondas, Nissans, and VWs, but my Subarus just can't be beat. They hug the road and can handle diverse weather conditions. I feel safe. I love to drive them. Glad I bought them. Great cars. Love them both.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the Subaru all-wheel drive system, the boxer engine, the sportshifter, and the new "VDC"- vehicle dynamics control that helps the vehicle from going out of control and flipping.

<TEXT>We bought a Subaru Impreza back in 2005 and loved it. At the time, I tried to talk my husband into the Forester, but he really wanted the Impreza. As soon as we saw the new design though, he was sold. We absolutely love it! We went on a short road trip with my Mom and our Border Collie, Abby and it was the most comfortable drive I've ever had. There is so much space inside. I was truly surprised at how roomy it is. There is plenty of cargo space as well. We have the Premium Package with the roof rails, tinted windows, etc and it was definitely worth the extra money. I would definitely recommend this car to anyone looking for the convenience of an SUV, but the driving comfort of a sedan. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Nice car, first Subi in 15 years. Drove all the others, studied the forums, happy with my choice. Only disappointment is the passenger's seat, very very low and not adjustable for height. Wife can barely see out! Fun to drive, feels solid, great viability in all directions. Great safety and best AWD around. Warning: Check your tire pressure after delivery from dealer. Many, including myself, have found the tires seriously overinflated (46 psi). Risk of tire failure this time of year! </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our new 2009 Forester, after going in to look at an Impreza. We had just been in a bad accident (totaled our car) and we were impressed with how easy it was to get in and out of the Forester. We prefer a manual shift as we live in the mountains and have been impressed with the mileage. We are pretty much averaging 30 mpg! We have 1800 miles on the car. We've only taken 2 long trips on the highway and we even hit 32 mpg at times on those. The car is a little underpowered, we have to downshift to get up some of the hills when we didn't have to downshift in our VW Jetta. There is a LOT of room inside, especially leg room. The hatch makes it easy to load and unload.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did a bunch of research before buying this vehicle and I was a bit hesitant buying a transition year. Don't hesitate. If you are thinking about this car run to your dealer, test drive it an pick your options. I was lucky enough to find a manual base model with the PZEV option. Without boring you with the technical details the bottom line is that the emissions from this car are almost the same as a Hybrid and only costs a few hundred dollars more. I have been averaging 28 MPG doing serious mountain driving. Up and down passes dirt roads etc. It handles everything effortlessly. So save the extra 10 grand and buy a Forester PZEV. NOt to mention the ongoing expense of batteries,tires.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our Forester Turbo at a little over $26k USD. The inside is amazingly spacious, enough legroom for 4 decently sized adults. Turbo hits hard from like 2500RPM-5000RPM, which is more than necessary for normal driving. Yeah, it could use a 5th gear because the high RPMs feel dead, but it's really not necessary. It goes fast enough. Tiptronic is nice. Your mileage will top out at about actually 27mpg for 100% highway driving, no AC and windows open at a constant speed of 60MPH (2100RPM). The XT WILL embarrass any other 4- cylinder car (with the exception of the really high end ones) and it will most certainly keep up with the 6's and 8's. Adequate trunk space. 5 star crash rating.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration, interior space, sound system on the XT and the limited versions, huge sunroof, sports grille, illuminated interior at night (blue LED), puddle lights, feels much more upscale than the Rav-4. Feels like you're driving/riding in a sedan.</FAVORITE>

I've had my Forester for a few months and already have 9000 miles without a hitch. I'm getting 28-30 mpg and like the ride on both highway and in town. The stereo is adequate, not great. Cargo room is like my previous 07 Forester. I wish I got the 5 speed to improve the performance off the line. When I drive in NYC my leg got cramped in my old car...a trade off. I'm just mad that the car policy at work changed and I have to sell it.</TEXT>

With gas going higher I had to get something newer and found this new Subie to be fantastic in MPG and fun. I never believed that anything could be so much fun to drive and still be a SUV. It has plenty of room, 9 inches of ground clearance, handles like a sports car and rides like a Cadillac. It has made me a believer and a fan. If everything I have read about this and previous Subarus is true, I will enjoy driving this one for a very long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall I like the vehicle and the dealer where I bought it was great. Got the Premium AWP in 5sp manual. Shifting is touchy on it compared to my VW which is more forgiving, but I'll get used to that over time. Pretty decent MPG - 25mpg around town on the 1st tank of gas. Looks nice, I'd recommend the front and rear spoilers to make it look different. I am 6'5" and fit in it fine with the moonroof and with my toddler or infant in a car seat behind me. There are some things to improve upon such as stock radio which is horrible until you add the sub and the tweeter kit and then it sounds pretty good. Also wish they had window rainguards and there is some whistling w/all windows open.</TEXT>

With proper maintenance, I am confident it will serve me well for miles to come. The car looks great from the outside and the interior design is fun and functional. The car is raised off the road yet handles with agility. The ride is secure and firm but drivers seat could use lumbar support. Great visibility and standard safetly features.

<TEXT>I traded in my '03 Forester (which I loved) for an '09 and I'm very happy I did. The '09 has a quieter highway ride and much improved interior room, both front and back. It has a slightly higher stance which makes it easier to get in and out of as well as improved visibility in traffic. It has a sportier looking dashboard -- I like the blue gauges. Clutch and transmission have a much smoother feel, and the Incline Start Assist is a big improvement over the old hill-holder function. The double wish bone rear suspension gives slightly better handling and a much smoother ride in most road conditions. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Improved head and leg room, enormous moon roof, tinted glass, radio and cruise controls in the steering wheel, 17" rims, extra beverage holders in the doors, and the mpg calculator -- I've been averaging 27.5 mpg in mixed city/highway driving since I brought it home.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We needed a platform that would accommodate a family of 4 for day trips, camping, daily commuting, Home Depot runs and just a general all-rounder so that we can keep the gas guzzling van in the car port as much as possible. The new Forester is turning into the most useful/loved car I've ever owned. It can easily accommodate a family of four. The seats fold down smartly and easily (no removing head rests) to provide a large cargo capacity. Visibility is excellent from all position for negotiating traffic and the size is perfect- big enough for a family of four, yet small enough for easy city driving and parking...all the comforts of a car w/ a bit of off road capability to boot! </TEXT>

Also, I purchased the Forester with auto dim mirror w/ compass, aero cross bars, cargo net vertical, and all weather mats, and body side molding kit (and a few other options I'm probably forgetting).

<TEXT>I Loved my 2005 Subaru Legacy Sedan, but after my son totalled it (oops) I knew I wanted a second Subaru. Spending more than I ever expected, I purchased the L.L. Bean edition 2009 Forester. I do love the car, but have three concerns. The plastic panel which covers the radio is not clear. It makes the numbers sl. blurry. Also, and of greater concern is that I experience a slight sideways motion when going over bumps. Will contact the dealer. Gas mileage not as good as I hoped for. 22.2 mpg. Sounds like I don't like my new car, but I love the reliability of Subaru. It's a beautiful car. As impressive on the outside as a Lexus. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Decided on the 2009 Forester after shopping for a 2008 and seeing the new 2009. Compared to the RAV4 and CRV, the '09 Forester won hands down. Subaru did their homework and addressed the shortcomings of their own as well as those of their competition. My wife loves her new "SUV" although it doesn't feel like one. The 4 cylinder has more than adequate acceleration but lacks a little on the highway. The quality, fit, and comfort are superb. I'm a little disappointed with gas mileage so far with 20 around town and pushing 25 highway. Maybe it will get better after more break in (900 miles so far). I trust this Subie will last a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were looking for a fun vehicle capable of easy off-road use with decent mileage and towable behind a motor home. Guess what: there aren't many choices that meet all these criteria. After searching the few options available we discovered the Forester. We're glad we did. This vehicle does it all. It's fun to drive, very capable in the snow, OK off the pavement, and has good fuel economy. The cabin is comfortable and very roomy for a small vehicle. Fit and finish is excellent. As with most crossovers there are compromises. It's not a rock crawler and it's not a sports car. However it does provide solid dependable transportation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Long time Outback sport owner looking for a replacement - test drove this, Impreza & WRX. A new driving experience that the entire family loves. Moonroof and excellent visibility combined with solid AWD traction is something that just needs to be experienced. Interior well- designed but material seems cheap. Transmission a key addition IMO - manual setting perfect for onramps/passing, off-roads. Tip to buyers - agree on price then say you will buy if dealer throws in accessories (that used to be standard) like cargo cover & tray, nets, etc. Also read the manual - a lot of things can be adjusted that might not consider. Looking forward to another 180,000 miles like I got on my last subaru. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased this SUV for 2 weeks. Have about 500 miles on it. No major complaints here. The mpg is about 21 city and 27 hwy. The AWD and turning radius are great. One minor thing, you can feel a noticeable delay when it goes from a lower gear to a higher one sometimes. Overall, the ride has been great, especially on inclines, where new Forester truly separates itself from 2008 CRV. The interior is good, although I wanted a LL beans, but for the price, I have no regrets. The exterior looks much better than CRV and RAV-4. Also, it does not hurt to know that Forester is 100% Japanese from parts to assembly. It is my first Subaru, hope its reliability is as good as Honda and Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I decided on the Forester after seeing the new platform for the '09 model. I leased an Impreza in the past and have always had a thing for Subaru vehicles, but hte look of the older model Foesters had always kept me away. This new style is just what I needed to get me in the Forester camp.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had test driven several Foresters from previous years with the moonroof and did not fit (6'2 280). Finally in 09 the head clearance is improved, and the seats are comfortable. As a first time Subaru owner, I am surprised at the the tight handling, adequate acceleration and how much fun it was to drive. I drove the X for a week and then returned it for the X w/ premium pkg. because of the extra features.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm used to full size pickup truck but with gas prices being the way they are decided to test drive the Forester. So far I'm very happy with my purchase. Getting like 24.5 mpg combined according to trip computer, 27-28 highway. for a little car it has enough room for hauling a good amount of stuff. I'm 6 foot tall and with the 09 I was able to adjust driver seat to comfortable position then got in the back seat and was still comfy at least for short rides. Haven't had bad weather since I've owned it but it feels nimble when driving. No it's not a Hemi but does a great job for a commuter car and loaded even for base model. And lots of room.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had my XT Limited for almost a month and couldn't be happier with it; I'm 6'4" and was having trouble finding a small SUV that fit--RAV4 wasn't even close (knees jammed into the dash), CRV was tight on the right knee (and I've owned the 2 previous generation CRV's that were fine in that respect) and too slow; driver's seat in the Acura RDX was ok, but the passenger seat didn't go back as far and again jammed my knees into the dash--I'm not going to buy a car I can't ride in as a passenger. The Forester has cavernous headroom, plenty of legroom, a better designed and more useful cargo area than the CRV, and is quicker, cheaper and has a much more comfortable ride than the RDX.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just traded in my 2007 on a 2009. My wife wanted automatic and I wanted her Civic for commuting, so quick pro quo was we keep a subie in the family if I get the new Forester, fair enough for me the subie can be our family roadster. Decided to lease, because I think diesel, hybrid and other technologies are going to be preferred in a year or two. I'm really impressed by the new design, big step forward. If I believe the gas mileage meter it's definitely better than the 2007, even before breaking it in. I'll test it in the moutains soon!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior appearance, interior finish, roominess and improved noise insulation. Kept Subaru handling, but rounded off some rough edges that some couldn't look past.

<TEXT>Decided to buy a Subaru after owning 3 Hondas and 3 Toyotas. Moved to the top of a very steep "second gear up" hill 2 years ago and wanted AWD. Have had the Forester for 2 months and the quality seems to be quite good. Snow season passed prior to purchase, but have driven my sister's 2007 Forester in the snow and it was a transcendent experience. Handles well in corners and on highway. Highway MPG is about 28.

<TEXT>We test drove an X model with the Premium package, and then an LL Bean model with NAV. Both were impressive, but we liked the perforated leather so we opted for that. The GPS was not set up for our region, but it didn't seem very intuitive so we passed. Ride is quite good and it corners very flat. It drives smoothly and SportShift is quick, completing shifts in a fraction of a second. This vehicle has the best visibility in its class, others have wide D- pillars and high rear windows and then try to up-sell you on a rear backup cam that is a cash cow for them, so you pay for their poor design.

I traded in my full size pick up a day later on the new 09 Forester 2.5X with the premium package. The handling is sporty and the ride is smooth. The fit and finish impeccable, much better then the truck. The headlights are very bright on high and really light up the road. The automatic transmission shifts smooth and is well geared.

(I'm still waiting for a hybrid or clean diesel from Subaru however). I was looking to purchase the new Outback Wagon, but decided on the new Forester because my husband actually fits comfortably (he's 6'4") and I liked the visibility.

<TEXT>This is my first Subaru and based on what I've seen so far it won't be my last. We had some pretty specific requirements for our next vehicle: A vehicle in which the whole family could fit including the dog. AWD (especially after this winter) Sunroof Manual. Not ugly. We looked at the Outback, RAV4 and CR- V and the Subaru beat the CR-V for real world driving. CR-V concerned me with part time AWD. RAV4 and Outback are more expensive with same options. The RAV4 actually has a 4x2 option? I also liked Subaru's dedication to safety. Side curtain air bags, active head restraints, roll over sensors and VDC all standard. There are a lot of extras in this SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the 2009 LL Bean w/nav to replace my 2004 XS premium. The 2009 is much quieter at highway speeds and the seats are more comfortable. I have only put 100 miles on the 09, but I did put 83,000 on the 04 (yeah I know, still new for a Subaru). Some pluses over the 04 are rear seat legroom, power driver seat, navigation, auto stick, VDC, side airbags, good looks, although I liked my ugly/unique 04. One problem, I can't understand why there is still only a 4 speed automatic. The vehicle is quiet enough but the RPMs are still high. I think the vehicle with a 5 or 6 speed would get gas mileage in the 30s. Imagine how many people would buy it. Gas in NY is over $3.45 (regular). </TEXT>

<TEXT>Tackling 45 degree potholed hills with no problems, this '09 Forester XT's practical (plenty of interior room given size, tight turn circle), and fun to drive (euro-style ride and handling). Turbo and SPORT A/T mode helps in passing, but some turbo lag remains (5 speed would better match power to wheels). No fuel miser (18 mpg mostly city) but may improve when broken in. Despite being 1st year car, is well finished (dash squeaks, clumsy rear hatch opening only irritants). Leather spices up decent if unremarkable interior. Good auto A/C, well laid out engine bay, other thoughtful touches. Huge ground clearance at 9 inches. A car offering practicality over style, and does it well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2009 Forester is a re-design. Bought Topaz Gold (hides the dirt) and love the huge moonroof. No one told me that the premium package had been seriously downgraded since the previous model year. So, do your research on this car, things have changed. Drives nice, steering is a little light at low speeds, basic cloth seats are cheap w/no lumbar support, tons of road noise with this model, could use a little more power, moonroof not tinted, reclining rear seats are a joke. Go top of the line and get turbo and power leather - you'll be happy.</TEXT>

I'm 6' 200 lbs and there's no bumping of the elbows, loads of open air above and tons of cargo room for the family. Handling is nimble and easy, the quiet cabin is a pure joy. The other impressive feature is the view, no blind spots, easy to back a trailer, the front view is panoramic! Absolutely love the suspension, not too hard or soft, easy to park, cruises with ease.

The ride and handling match that of many Euros (which would be helpless on roads the Forester devours), and the interior flexibility make it roomy and versatile.

Good looks (topaz gold), adequate power (5 speed manual shifts tight & smooth), quiet in the cabin, and great MPG (28+). The moonroof is huge. The build quality (espcly for a new model) is flawless. The IPOD i/f is great. And having AWD with the VDC feature is great in snow. Safety features are lengthy & very impressive. Price was competitive. And resale should be great down the road. My only complaints so far are that the HVAC blower is a little noisier than it should be, and the [variable assist] steering feels a bit too light when driving slow.</TEXT>

<TEXT>No problem with it so far except gas door release level falling off. Decent acceleration from stop but no power at all on highway especially with ac on, need to drive in "power" mode or else difficult to pass or climb hills. 50/50 mileage averaging 21mpg with the 4spd auto. Will not get the 28mpg+ some claim unless going below 60mph. Not sure about you, but I don't drive on all stretches of country road. A small v6 with a 5 or 6 spd auto would have been better. Interior much smaller than mid-sized SUV with no 3rd row seating. Frankly the only slight increase (15%) in fuel economy was not worth giving up the space and seating option.

I searched many other cars and found that Subaru's AWD is by far the most reasonably priced. If you want a great stereo and lumbar support, don't go with the base. However, if you want decent payments on a reliable SUV, go for the base. It is a great vehicle that handles well, steering is responsive and I never feel as though my safety is compromised.

<TEXT>The car was great in the beginning, but then it slowly began showing signs of poor craftsmanship. After 3-4 months, my brakes kept on squeaking. The engine is very loud at start-up. At my 1 year anniversary, with 20,000 miles on it, my engine gave up (rod knock). The engine was replaced, but I'm now very hesitant to even drive it normally, knowing that it had already broken down with normal use (I don't race it... even if I wanted to, the "turbo" is not meant for that purpose). I don't think spending over $30k on a car with AWD, and a "turbo" that is not going to knock my socks off by any means is worth the money. Go buy yourself a Toyota or Honda V6 instead.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Since there are pluses and minuses for all vehicles, we did not feel that the Forester had any major weaknesses; WRONG! Starting with trim levels, if you want any lumbar support, you are forced to buy the limited trim which translates into a higher payment. I could easily do without leather or the extras however with a bad back, the choice was essential. The transmission is not shifting correctly and it has been a fight with the dealership. It has been eight days since we met with the Subaru rep and while he agrees that the transmission is not right, the dealership has still not called; how lovely. Very poor performance in the mountains on a recent trip and the door skins are very thin.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ever shrinking budgets for clearing winter roads convinced me I needed an AWD vehicle. Was looking for something with good gas mileage, AWD, large cargo capability, and smooth ride. The Forester does all these things very well. All weather package is nice for us Michigan folks. Heated wipers, mirrors, and seats plus all weather mats came in handy already this year. Planning many road trips this summer. Forester has very smooth ride on rough and/or dirt roads. Huge moonroof is nice as is the reclining rear seats. Rear seats pop down very easily. Fuel economy has been good at around 25mpg, mostly city. Gets close to 28 on highway. Not super flashy or fast but so far, I love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>To the guy who claims a 5 spd auto trans...bad news, your dealer lied to you. One of the well know (& documented) Forester complaints is the lack of an overdrive gear for the AT, mileage would noticeably improve on the highway instead of the 25 MPG that we get doing 75 MPH. And a 4spd auto with overdrive is same as a 5spd. Plus check the sportshift for that "5th" gear. Mid-year gearbox change is major effort and tough to see. Our review: this is our 2nd Sub & liked the Outback better. The Forester feels cheap even w/ the premium pkg; the improved mpg might not be worth giving up the space of a larger SUV; zero passing power.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Apparently the 2009 2.5 liter turbo engine has some metallurgic problems. Our engine began making loud banging sounds on a road trip after just 4,000 miles on it. Worked fine prior to this catastrophic breakdown. Subaru will be replacing the engine with hopefully a correctly produced engine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After suffering through 40 snow events in Chicago last winter, I decided that, while I loved my BMW sedan, I would not go through another winter without an AWD vehicle. I looked at and test drove AWD BMWs including the sedans, X5 and X3. I expanded to other brands, including Ford, Infiniti, Acura, Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Audi. I had been trying to decide between a sedan (the Infiniti M35X) and an SUV (BMW X3) when an old tree-hugging friend recommended that I look at the new Forester. Indeed, that was the last vehicle that I test drove (an XT Limited). I was pleasantly surprised by not only the performance, but the comfort, convenience and utility.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned 3 Subarus now but this might be my last. The engine blew on my 2009 Forester XT yesterday. Unfortunately this appears to be all-too-common with this year's model. It's at the dealer now and everyone has been great so far with the warranty replacement. Still I can't help feeling remorse with a car that's not even a year old. If this is truly a problem across the model then Subaru needs to step up and address it proactively before they have more stranded motorists. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I enjoyed the car until the engine stopped and left me stranded on the Interstate today. The Roadside Assistance feature works well, very efficient. I got good gas mileage. The AWD is wonderful especially in the rain. The interior is well designed but the radio is inferior - sound quality is just not there. The ride and comfort level were good. Reliability and faith in Subaru took a hit today after 5,000 miles of fun, I am without a vehicle. Not looking forward to the inconvenience of getting the car back - the nearest dealer is almost 100 miles away.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Compared Forester to Rav4, Escape, Rogue. Glad I picked it. Have driven 1,000 miles so far. Ride is comfortable, visibility is great, fuel economy is great. Averaging 25 - 27 mpg in combo city, back roads, highway. No rattles, problems with cup holders or PZEV noise like other reviewers mentioned. Haven't had snow usage yet, but based on the other Subarus I've had - I'm sure it will be great. In my opinion, the Forester is the best value in a small/medium SUV for interior space, fuel economy, price, comfort.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First time Subaru owner. I was shopping around for a a new fresh SUV. Rav4 and CRV were on top of my list till a friend recommended I look at the Forester. I told him the wagon? He said no it's got a whole new design and rated #1. Test drove the LL Bean Ed. and loved it from the start. My wife kept smiling at the salesman. Well we went home with it that same day. Now my wife and I fight over it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, to start I should mention I put reliability low because the service people are idiots. Brought the forester in for a checkup and oil change, comes back with 2L too much oil - we discovered after the engine blew. Car is good, interior is pretty nice although leather stretched quickly. Stereo pretty well stinks considering it's 'premium' - nice that it doesn't get scratchy at high volume, although it's stupid that out of 40 knotches, it's not reasonably loud until about 30. Also fuel economy is hardly a selling feature once owned, not good in city at all. I have a 310HP pickup that gets better mileage, although tank is 20L larger, still gets about 400-600km per tank, forester barely hits 400.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted to comment about the complaints regarding the use of a 4- speed auto transmission instead of 5- speeds in the Forester 2.5X AT. I have tested it, counted shifts and watched tach, and my AT definitely has 5 gears. It does not shift into 5th gear until about 60 mph if the engine is cold, but if warmed up and driving on a flat surface, the 5th gear will engage as low as 35-40 mph as long as you are not heavy on the gas pedal. Regardless of what the 09 Forester owners manual says, the dealership confirmed that the AT is really a 4-speed with an overdrive. Could this be something the assembly line changed mid-year? Mine was one of last 2009s to come off the assembly line in Dec. 2008.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>First and foremost, high visibility while driving, instead of a rounded, low-profile roofline like other vehicles. Auto-dimming compass mirror is a big plus if you commute while it is dark like I do. Rear cargo compartment will fit a full-sized spare if you choose. Highway noise minimal. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Read many reviews before purchasing our 2nd Subaru, saw many great plus several poor ones but purchased anyway. We are very pleased with the Forester; great ride, rear seat wide and deep enough for our 3 growing boys, fuel economy much better than advertised (24 mpg city so far even with less than 100 miles on it) with MT. Seems to me that most complaints involve the turbo models and the 4AT transmission so avoid those and this is a GREAT vehicle. Looks very sharp equipped with the rugged package. Invoice pricing at start nice change from most dealers even in this economy who still think they can ask for sticker!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Subaru. Have had 05 Outback 2.5 and 06 Tribeca. My biggest complaint -- regulating the heat is virtually impossible! I don't like a lot of heat coming out but you either get none, or way too much. I also do not like the materials used in the interior, I am sure they will show wear and tare shortly. The seats are fine, I am talking more about the trim on door panels, etc. The center console is not the greatest either. Actual MPG since I purchased vehicle 24.2, per computer 24.4. I hope when vehicle broken in it will improve somewhat. Exterior is great, lots of room on inside. One more thing, cabin could be a little quieter. Too noisy on the highway.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD, reasonable mpg, bluetooth works great (better than my Nissan I had before), radio "ok" great visibility, excellent storage, unfortunately no snow any longer (live near Providence, RI) so will have to wait until next year but should be fine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the Forester after leasing a Tribeca for 3 years. Now I wish I had bought the Tribeca which was a far superior vehicle in every way. The Forester does handle excellently in ice and snow but highway driving does not inspire confidence. Vehicle is easily buffeted by wind and uneven road surface. Engine performance meets expectations for this class of SUV. Interior OK but rear speakers malfunctioned in first 6 months and annoyingly loud squeak has developed from the rear tire compartment. Dealer says this is common complaint and they don't quite know what to do about it. Mileage averages 25 combined city and highway. Overall, 2009 Forester does not live up to hype.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the 7th Subaru that I have either owned or leased (5 owned and 2 leased) and this the worst experience I have had so far. The initial concept is good, but the end product definitely needs improvement. I drive 30,000 miles a year in MN. Poor windshield wiper design (front and back), build quality needs to be upgraded (had a water leak in the vent system and now I have major mildew problems. Poor placement of heated seat switches, auxiliary outlet plug, and IPOD plug. Heat is either off or on with poor modulation. Poor design on center storage/cup holders. Needs a five speed transmission; hunts for gears all the time. Buy an Outback. Forester missed the mark, at least for now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I found my 2009 Subaru Forester to be a very good vehicle. It is roomy and easy to get in and out of, I don't have to duck or crawl. I bought my vehicle last June and have 18000 km on it. At 6 ft tall and 250 lbs, I found the Forester a very comfortable fit, as it is larger than the 2008 version. The steering is positive but is not twitchy. The vehicle holds the road well in all seasons. Snow and ice have not been of a problem, even though we had more snow this year than previously. Any time we go anywhere, we have to cross a summit, yet have not had any concerns with the Forester. I researched vehicles on the net and Subaru was the best vehicle, so I bought it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the AWD and the Automatic with Sport Shift. The Sport Shift allows for smoother climbs up hills, as by getting out of Auto, you can manually shift without the surging you get as the automatic hunts for the right gear for the speed. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was originally looking at Honda CRV and Toyota Rav4, but was concerned about their blind spots and bad rear visibility for backing up. So I looked at the Subaru (with AMAZING visibility in ALL directions) and sold on the appearance, performance and features. The Subaru Symetrical AWD is also superior to the 4WD technology on Honda and Toyota. Regarding other reviews: The base trim does not have cup holders in the back seat center console, but ALL trims have cup holders embedded in the back doors (perhaps the other reviewers haven't noticed?). The radio seems just fine to me. The passenger seat is low, but not a showstopper. The driver seat is very comfortable in the Limited trim.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my fifth Subaru, and I am very happy with it. With the M5 transmission, I am averaging 26 mpg in a rural setting. It has preformed well in snow [8" with drifts], and it has given me no problems. The added room in the back seat is a plus, and the general style is well suited. I do miss the quirky looks of the old Forester, it was unique and readily recognized by other Subaru drivers. The mechanics of this model seem to be better than the old though, it has a smoother ride, sits higher, and has a more solid feel to it while on the road.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning Lexus, Audi and Acura models in the past, I decided that paying for panache was no longer worth it. I wanted an SUV with good MPG and an excellent AWD system. After reading about the 2009 Forrester and the awards it has earned, the decision was easy. I got the fully loaded vehicle three days before 8 inches of snow fell, and driving in the snow was like driving on dry ground. The AWD system is as good as Audi's Quattro which to me in the gold standard. The Forrester is very comfortable and there's plenty of room for 5. As a music lover, I disliked the SUV's stereo speakers so much that I had them replaced even before pick up. So far, I'm very happy with it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the fourth Subaru I have bought and I have loved all of them except for this one. Where do I begin?? Well for starters the interior rattles like a bucket of bolts, I took it back at around 10 K because the exhaust center pipe had a faulty weld. Got that fixed and two weeks later the transmission (manual) started making a noise. It turns out that it was machined wrong where the driveshaft meets the tranny and it needed a whole new unit. I just got it back two days ago now it sounds like the passenger CV joint is clicking when I turn right. This car is absolute garbage!!! I wish I would have kept my 05 Forester!!!! </TEXT>

Car is running fine but gas mileage has dropped considerably. They keep telling me to be patient but on a new car that is hard to do. I was getting between 20 and 21 in town and 24 to 26mpg on highway. I have not seen the number 20 since they replaced the engine. The reason I bought the car was for at least 20mpg and now I am stuck. This is my 4th Subaru. I have always been happy but this really makes me angry. Not sure I would buy another.

The fabric on the doors already looks worn, the electric seats crack the plastic covers around the legs every time I move the seat back, the rubber seal around the back passenger door fell off... The position of the seat heater knobs is unreachable while driving. Plus, my factory installed remote start doesn't work unless the car is already warmed up. The dealership says there have been other complaints about this happening but nothing is being done to fix it. Subaru customer service is terrible. Don't buy this car!!</TEXT>

It is fun to drive, handles beautifully (especially in the snow), and has plenty of room but you don't feel like you're driving a bus.

Not a big deal. Options I bought, tweeter, woofer, IPod connection, fog lights, all weather mats, cargo tray, rear spoiler, hood protector, rugged package (You should buy the rugged package). Handles great on slick streets. Have had to break under emergency condition one time and handling and breaks worked well. Acceleration is very adequate for my driving style.

<TEXT>The engine on this car (turbo) blew up in a remote location late at night in a snow storm. We had kids in the car. BAD experience. Totally unacceptable for a car with 9600 miles on it. Subaru paid for the rental car for the time my car was at the dealer; plus got them to pay me $1000 for my hassle and pay for free scheduled maintenance on the car for the rest of the lease term. I was told by dealer that turbo engines have an oil piping problem. The turbo gets starved of oil. The result is mechanical failure of turbo. Metal pieces somehow get into engine.

<TEXT>My first Subaru and first AWD vehicle. Build quality, fit and finish seem very good. Comfortable ride, great on snowy roads but the factory tires will need to be replaced eventually with more wintry all-season tires. The factory ones are really better suited for dry pavement, in my opinion. When I picked this car I primarily liked the cabin size and volume. I felt I was getting better value over the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CRV (and can't stand rear-door mounted spare tire!). Radio has nice features but sound quality is only fair. Comfortable ride. Combined city/hwy is 22.5 MPG in this hilly area. Only 1700 miles on car at this point. So far, a real pleasure to drive and own. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love all the room. Reminds me of my old Jeep Cherokee: square and boxy (but a much better ride and gas mileage!). Rear seat passengers have adequate leg and headroom. When back seats are folded down, they actually fold completely level with cargo floor. Like both the interior and exterior styling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wrote a review earlier and wanted to share some mileage numbers. In town driving normal which is like everyone else being somewhat aggressive our XT will get 19 MPG, baby it at the lights and corners and 22 MPG is possible. Needless to say we get 19 MPG most of the time. Highway at 75 MPH steady, it gets 23 MPG. Side roads at 55 MPH to 65 MPH we can get 25 MPG reliably. Recently we took a 160 mile trip up into the mountains. For anyone from N. Colorado, we drove from Greeley to Lyons, up highway 7 to Allens Park, then to Estes and then to Fort Collins. Nearly a 4000 ft gain but we drove conservatively near the speed limits and got 26.1 MPG. Never lacked power.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have put 20,000 miles on the Forester in six months and find it to be a pleasant vehicle to drive. I am a big guy and find the drivers seat comfortable and the interior controls within easy reach except for the heated seat switches. It performs well in the snow in Vermont with the standard tires and the gas mileage has been a steady 24 to 25 mpg with lots of hwy driving. The passenger seat is strange to get used to with it being so low. There is a rattle in the moonroof mechanism that needs attention and the road noise is loud compared to our Camry.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The moonroof and mileage are our two favorites. The heated seats are a nice touch as well as the heated wiper area that melts the accumulated snow and ice in a storm.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought an 09 Forester XT limited. With only 900 miles, the car died going down interstate. Had it towed to the dealership to find out the engine was blown and the service people had seen 5 of these, all with less than 1000 miles!! Since they are new, it will be a minimum of 2 weeks to maybe get an engine delivered, probably a month. I owned 3 outbacks and loved them, but this is unacceptable. Save yourself the headache, time and energy and buy a different brand!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Good value, drives more car like than truck like. Car drives well and has good power with turbo. A person could get buy with out turbo,but may be a little under powered for some. Gas mileage avg 19-21 mpg back and forth to work. Transmission and all wheel drive work fine. Hood scoop and chrome like pedals and foot rest are a little kiddish on a Forester. People looking at Forester would want power passenger seat more. Good handling for SUV, seems nimble. Rear window overhang creates more dust and dirt on window and would be better without that design. Traded in BMW 325xi which is the most overrated car I have ever driven.

<TEXT>I am very disappointed with the features of this vehicle that are not working properly. The radio has poor reception and Subaru keeps telling us that it is a setting that needs to be changed on the radio itself, Unfortunately that is not the problem. When you fade just to the rear speakers the radio barely comes in at all and the reception is poor on any setting. The rim design on the 2.5X Limited is also poor the vehicle is sold as an all wheel drive for snow and other types of bad driving conditions, however when it snows more than 4" snow gets in the inner part of the rim and freezes over night causing the vehicle to shake excessively at 40 plus mph. We are being told to purchase other rims.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been disappointed in this vehicle! The insulation in this vehicle is poor. The heater works wonderfully but just about freeze my legs on the driver side. The dealership installed an electronic start and I believe they have messed up the electrical system as nothings seems quite right. What about the mileage. I am seeing 15-18 and I now have 4000 miles on this vehicle and am NOT speeding. I left my keys in the car and turned OFF yet in less than 3 hours my car battery was totally DEAD. This certainly can't be a safety feature to have a battery lose charge this quickly. I agree about the noise!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Subaru and so far I'm pleased overall. However, the lack of lumbar support and position of the head rests do make this somewhat uncomfortable. They take some getting use to. (My petite wife complains even more than I do.) The console holds my travel mug just fine. The biggest plus for this is the sure-footedness I encountered in snow/icy conditions. The AWD really grips, and the handling is very responsive. I bought the manual because that's what I enjoy driving and wanted to get the better gas mileage. The throw into 5th is a bit of a reach. The first four gears are fine and smooth. Gas mileage 26.4 overall. Traveling over 65 brings MPG down quickly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 3 months of driving, I'm pleased to say this is a great vehicle. The ride is smooth, cabin noise is low if you remove the rack crossbars. The turbo really adds to the experience once you get used to the surge as it kicks in. Effortlessly cruises at 75 MPH. The AWD is sure footed and the heated wipers, mirrors, and seats are wonderful during the CO winters. Actual mileage is good, 22 around town, 25 on the highway though if you drive aggressively in town you can easily drop the city mileage to mid- teens. It's a turbo after all. Coming from a Volvo S60 AWD, I find the Forester similiar in many ways. Well maybe not the dash materials but it's just fine, I didn't pay S60 prices.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The headrests on this vehicle are designed so that they push the driver's head down and forward. This causes a number of people to have severe headaches and back pain after an average commute. In addition, there are NO cupholders in this vehicle. Subaru does not want a Subaru owner to drink fluids while they drive the vehicle... this according to Subaru corporate. The transmission is tough to get into reverse about 30% of the time. Experience with other makes and models indicates that transmissions that are difficult to put into reverse when new, are maintenance headaches later on. Engine runs a little rough after only 4000 miles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was a '98 Outback owner (and proud of it); when the wife and I decided to go new, it was either the Prius or the Forester. We made the right choice as this car is fun, peppy, roomy, sunny and a blast to drive. We were on vacation for 10 days, and we both missed driving it! Everywhere we went, we said, "Wouldn't it be fun to have the Subaru" for hills, curves and wonderful mountain roads... and most especially the Pacific Coast Highway. No rattles, good MPG and more room and visibility than we know what to do with! So far, a worthy successor to my beloved Outback (160k miles).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Okay, I bought this vehicle since I loved my husband's Subaru outback, but wanted a small SUV for my company car. My previous car was a VW Passat. First, the cloth seats have very poor support for long drives (should've opted for leather). Will be adding a lumbar support unit from a local detail shop. Tried to get the door rattles fixed from the dealership. They were not able to help and made them worse by trying. Am trying to love the car but kind of wished I had opted for the Subaru Outback or another VW Passat. If you do purchase this vehicle, go for one of the higher end packages (> 2.5XP) since you may get better interior quality. Gas mpg isn't bag... averaging about 25 mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sun roof is beautiful and BIG. The seats fold down nicely to provide a good cargo area (a lot of room for the 4 legged friends too). Gas mileage isn't bad, about 25 mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm the guy that would never own a foreign car; things change. I drove several small suvs, looking for the right combination. My nephew finally convinced me to test drive a Subaru. I'm now a convert. The Subaru Forester was by far the best buy for the money and the type of vehicle needed here in Colorado. It drives better and is quicker than the GM Equinox, plus it gets much better gas mileage. Plus, you can get the all-weather package for only $400 which includes heated seats, wiper deicers, and outside mirror defrosters. All- wheel drive is also standard, perfect for the snowy winters here. The other domestics felt like driving tanks compared to the Forester. </TEXT>

<TEXT>As a whole this is a great car. Family of 4. Went from a van to this car and are happy with the room and comfort. What I really like is the exceptional handling, gas mileage and vision available on the 09 Forrester. A big change from the Dodge Van. We currently have a lot of snow in Seattle and I can say this is the best car I've ever driven in the snow.. it goes anywhere with no issues. My only issues with this car are the stereo. It's cheap and sounds terrible. Looked to replace it which is close to impossible. If you want a good stereo bargain with the dealership before you buy it. Second, it rattles excessively.. makes it sound cheap and is irritating.</TEXT>

No rattles but they have cut corners with hard plastics, cheap looking and feel carpet and roof line cover. Silver on dashboard reflects on outside mirrors. Stereo is very sad. Upgraded with there tweeter and subwoofer and still sounds so-so. Gas mileage not that great. Considering the price, you get a lot of room, I am 6- 3", feels comfy, all wheel drive, handles well, many safety features, room in the back.

<TEXT>Bought my 09 Forester this summer, and am a little disappointed in the cheap quality of the plastic interior parts, such as the center console. It chips and flakes off with hardly any contact. In addition, I am very disappointed in the "carpet", which appears to be more of a felt material. Absolutely everything sticks to it and it doesn't vacuum up well at all. I didn't do an in depth inspection of the carpet and such at the time I bought it, as I expected more from a Subaru. Other than these interior issues, it's great. I'm guessing you just have to buy the upper end styles to get a decent interior. </TEXT>

The deal maker for me was the value of the car compared to others. It has AWD, electronic stability control, curtain air bags, plenty of cargo space. I like how this crossover handles like a car but has enough ground clearance to see over midsize trucks and mini vans. My only advice is to educate yourself if you never had a boxer engine or AWD system. </TEXT>

It just feels solid when your driving and, has great response in steering and breaking. We love everything about it so far. Have had compliments on body style and color, (sage green). First tank of gas avg. 24.3 mpg. combination city and highway. Also pleased with that. I was also surprised with the pep of the 4 cylinder after driving V6`s &V8`s.

<TEXT>This is my first and last Subaru. I bought it because of it's reputation and the new design. I've been driving it 5 months and as much as I try to love it, I do not like it at all. The road noise is excessive, I already have several rattles. You sit very low to the ground, even lower than some cars so if you are used to sitting higher up, beware. The acceleration is slower than I had hoped for. Also, the mpg isn't as good as expected either.

<TEXT>So I've had my Subie (1st time Subie buyer) for 7 months now and here are my thoughts. Overall, I love the vehicle. It handles very well (haven't had any snow yet to test the all-wheel) and is quite roomy. The only "problem" that I've had thus far is the paint on the plastic in the interior doesn't stick to the plastic. The paint literally wore off of the driver's door handle from my knee resting on it while driving! This occurred only after 3 months of ownership. The dealership immediately ordered a new door handle and handled the issue w/ the utmost professionalism. Problem is, when the car is out of warranty, I'm stuck w/ the problem. The silver paint scratches off very easily.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, I like this car. I considered buying a Forester a few years ago, but I couldn't get over the wagon-type exterior and small back seat. The 2009 Forester looks better and is bigger inside. I have almost 3,000 miles now and I enjoy the ride and the interior and exterior styling. I definitely love the moonroof. I am 6'4" and I have enough room in the driver's and rear seat. The major concern I have is the weak stereo. You have to turn the volume at least halfway to hear it, and even higher when listening to the iPod. I haven't encountered any snow yet here in New England, but if this car is as good as my previous Legacy, I'll be happy. Mileage is good for an AWD vehicle. </TEXT>
