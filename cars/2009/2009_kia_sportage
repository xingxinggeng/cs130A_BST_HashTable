<TEXT>Purchased in July, thanks to cash for clunkers, and So far I love the Sportage. We got the Smokey Brown color and constantly get compliments. We lug around our 3 kids with the oldest being 14 and they love it as well. It is suprisingly roomy. High safety marks,amenities you find in much pricier vehicles, and a great warranty are just icing on the cake.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety ( side curtain airbags, as well as front, Tire pressure monitor,front active headrests etc...) Keyless entry, Sirius radio, USB and aux inputs, good on gas,10 year warranty, smooth ride and great value...there are so many.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall, we really like the Sportage. The ride is excellent and very smooth for a SUV. The acceleration is a little sluggish but isn't missed in normal driving. The headrest positioning is a little uncomfortable but can be adjusted with some work to a workable compromise.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride is very smooth and handling is very good. Safety features are very impressive.The rear reclining seats and their complete fold down ability are great features. Since I'm in Texas, the AC is a huge selling feature and the Sportage (and Kia's in general) have the best I've seen by far</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my KIA new in June. Got everything on it, leather, sun roof, GPS etc. I live in the mountains, and while the V-6 delivers adequate power, the transmission down shifts "very" rough, very annoying. Dealer says it is normal but I have never seen a transmission that rough. GPS very user "unfriendly" and costs lots of $ to update. Car rides and handles well and is fun to drive. Mileage very good. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great sound system, like the satalite radio, don't loose stations in the mountains. Leather interior look great and seats are very comfortable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I read the reviews, I like the car, If you do not like the arm rest chec out chic.com We bought one and it looks and feels like it came with the car. Head rests, oh yeah, they are adjustable or you can turn them around. All that being said, Low Rpm performance is questionable. Dealer said my car needs to adjust to my driving style...emmmm I do like this car</TEXT>

<TEXT>after inflated ford escape and toyota dealer sticker prices I purchased my first Kia , This SUV seems well constructed and tight, It handles well and is fund to drive and even with all the added options its cost is almost half that of the others. After 30 years of American car dealer deception the purchase was a nice change.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked for a good car that was safe and good on gas to replace my 99 suburban. I love the sportage but the headrest position is tough, not enough options for comfort especially for the front seat passenger. Also having a hard time getting used to no arm rest for the driver. I would recommend this car highly</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks seats reclining in back and folding flat</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The front seats are the worst seats I ever sat on headrest are just as bad no armrest up front so your right arm has no were to rest. Rear seat could use cup holders other then the door. The rear area is roomy and the seats are better. The Sportage is a great size and it is not a bad ride for an suv. I will say make sure you fully check what ever car you buy there are no returns. Take it for a good long ride not a short spin.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just traded my 1996 Jeep Cherokee (cash for clunker)for a 2009 Kia Sportage. Gas mileage is great and love the value I got for my $$$. Could not be happier with the buying experience. Thanks Murray Kia!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the fact that it is a front wheel drive SUV and glad it comes with keyless entry. 2008 used that I looked at did not have keyless.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We're looking for a family size car with decent fuel efficiency under 20K. We've checked RAV4, CR-V, Mazda 5, Santa Fe, Rondo, & Sportage. After the test driving, knocked off RAV4, Rondo & Mazda 5. CR-V not chosen simply because we've owned Honda & wanted to make a change + price. Santa Fe looked good but fuel efficiency was somewhat disappointing. This sportage gave us smooth ride, enough power (family of 4), and it was quite spacious for all 4 passengers. The 2nd row seat has three reclining options which are great to our kids during a long ride. On top of that, Kia's 3K incentive made it impossible to find some other alternatives. Purchased around 13K w/ Cash for clunkers.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>- Safety features (air bags, curtains ..., ranked as top). - Space - Flat folding 2nd row seat + reclining - all the standard features (hard to find what is missing) - Warranty + platinum (if purchased): no extra cost for 10 yrs except maintenance</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the look and handling of my 2009 Kia Sportage but, the headrests are at the most uncomforatable angle and there isn't anything I can do to adjust them. The angle is too far forward!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>interior and exterior styling, smooth ride</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The reviewer who said the Kia Sportage isn't so fun to drive has not spent the last 10 yrs dragging around in a big van! I've only had it a couple weeks but so far I am super impressed! Plenty of get up & go, great handling, surprisingly smooth ride, excellent stereo, quiet engine. I got the whole pkg; nice leather seats, classy brushed metal trim, nav system...accoutrements I have not experienced in years & could never have afforded in another comparable vehicle. But really, it is the ride & handling that totally impresses me. The rest is just the big cherry on the sundae. Time will tell but this just feels like a quality vehicle. Can't wait for my next road trip!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth ride, great handling, quick pick up, quiet, quality appointments, suprisingly comfortable back seat (and LOVE the ease of lowering them for the dogs as opposed to dragging in & out), great sound system. Can't say enough. What a pleasant surprise this vehicle is!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this Kia after my old car, a '99 VW Beetle, kicked the bucket. I have long been dreaming for an SUV, but didn't expect to find one in the $15K price range I was aiming for. Stumbled upon the Kia dealership, and was impressed with the RAV4 & Forester matching features of the Kia in such an affordable package. I've had it for 3 weeks now and am overall impressed. Horsepower is a bit lacking, but fuel economy is decent (23 mpg on my first tank, 90% city). Handling is secure, if not sports-car-like. Interior is ergonomic, durable, & comfortable without the silly frills found in other cars of this segment. Easily the most bang for the buck in the small SUV category.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Price & value, ergonomic no-nonsense interior, USB & aux input connections, interior space & comfort, Smokey Brown color, long-throw shifter, most of the features are standard in base trim, flat-fold rear seats, durability of materials, Kia warranty, no-pressure dealership purchasing experience.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the kia sportage, i weigh 215 pounds and i am 6ft3 and i find myself to be very comfortable in both the driver seat and the passenger seat. I like the arm rest in the back as well as every door in the kia has a cup holder as well as the back seat arm rest. My car came with cruise control and a sunroof and a v6 engine with 60,000 mile warranty and 3 months of satellite radio. And they even gave me a even trade in on ford explorer (it had 70,000 miles on it) and i still owed 10,000 dollars on it. So i think i got a real bargain. Oh and my headrests are adjustable. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the legroom and the way it rides on the highway (smooth) </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did a lot of research between subaru, honda, toy and suzuki. You can't beat the quality, safety features (ESC, traction control, 6 airbags,all 5 star crash rating) and the 5 yr 60 mile bumper to bumper, 10yr 100k drive train warranty. I choose the 5 spd 4cyl to get the most miles per gallon. I find the 4 cyl. has plenty of zip plus its fun to drive. Living in New England getting a 4x4 was equally important. This is my second KIA, I find the quality is excellent. The sportage also has plenty of storage and room to handle my 3 kids and their gear. I owned a 07 Honda, i find the finish superior on the Kia. Maybe not as refined as a honda, but this is a very capable suv and 5000 less.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quality, warranty, all around safe vehicle, satelite radio is excellent, a lot of storage especially when you fold down the rear seats, good visibility,4X4. Exterior finish is excellent,good seating posit., love that you have the option of only opening the rear window to put items in the cargo area.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I researched many cars offering similar amenities. The KIA appeared to offer better features for the lowest price. I was not disappointed, it has great features and is very well built. While not a powerhouse the engine offers sufficient power for highway driving. The seating layout and flexibility is well done providing real flatbed storage. The transmission is smooth. I wish that KIA offered a larger tyre option, but it is not a major flaw. The finish and engineering are of high quality. The entertainment system, bluetooth and component inputs make offer more luxury features than are found on many prestige cars. I was surprised and disappointed to find an ashtray, GPS space would be better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall interior configuration and finishes are excellent. Entertainment system and its component and bluetooth options are superior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far I absolutely love this vehicle, the only thing I don't like is the non- adjustable headrest, which can be uncomfortable on long drives...it's great on gas, the radio system is great...I love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our third Kia, and, as per the other Kias that we owned, the quality, and dependability is there.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 4 wheel drive feature is a must in our area because of the harsh winters. Kia has a great 4 wheel lock and all wheel drive feature on the Sportage that exeeds our expectations.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was very hesitant about buying a Kia, for I have not heard very good things about them in the past. I searched several SUVs and for the price w/ 60K warranty the Sportage is a real bargain! The car is great on gas as long as your foot is not permanently heavy and the seats are very comfortable. There is plenty of space - just as much as the Sorrento and its better on gas. The stereo is very good for factory. My main complaint is there is not arm rest !! So far I love the car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Back seat lean back and the seats are very comfortable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking for an affordable SUV that was not a gas guzzler. The mileage is not as good as the Jeep Patriot, but for this price the Sportage is a real bargain. If your foot isn't heavy all the time, you can easily get 22-24 MPG. Kia product has dramatically improved since Hyundai bought them out. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Back seats lean back for snoozing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What is not to like about a quality 4x4 6 cylinder SUV for $16K. Electric windows, power locks, cd player, excellent in the snow. Only one problem was the right side power mirror stopped working. Will wait for a month and see if any other little things pop up. The best deal is a 10 year / 100,000 mile warranty. Come on now see if you can come close to Toyota and Honda with this kind of deal. I researched this hard before I bought and I am please as punch to get this great car. Time will tell how it stand up but so far so good.</TEXT>
