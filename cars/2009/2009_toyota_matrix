<TEXT>I needed an economical, affordable, and reliable car for around town and to commute to work in. The Matrix fits what I need exactly, it's big enough for a child seat in the back seat, has the versatility of a "mini" SUV, is pretty stylish, and is actually fun (enough) to drive every day. The 1.8L with 5 speed won't win any races, but is surprisingly smooth and refined, especially on the highway. I know a lot of reviews on the new Matrix are filled with critics, but I really think it's a great little car for what it tries to be. Our other car is a Lexus, and our 3rd Lexus - the Matrix gauges have the same feel of the new IS, really. Give the Matrix a shot, I'm glad I didn't buy a Civic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great performance, so far has been reliable. I've enjoyed driving this car. Handles great. Headrest is very uncomfortable, causes pain in the neck and back. A little hard on fuel. Other than that I would say Matrix is a great car, I have a S AWD.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I actually really like my 09 Matrix S, but I have run into a few problems. My seats spot too easily during rainy weather. There is a blind spot in rear window. Gas mileage is not as great as it could be. My stereo keeps blacking out/powering off and is suppose to be replaced next week.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance is great. I love my Sundance color. Dealership staff is always great when I take my car in for service.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>2009 Toyota Matrix</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have had my Matrix for one year today and have loved every minute of it. I drove my first Matrix as a rental car in 2005 and had wanted one ever since but did not like the 1.8 liter engine. When I found out that the car had been redesigned in 2009 with a 2.4 liter engine I jumped on the chance to get it. The gas mileage is a little low but is well worth it in my book. I would definitely recommend the Matrix if you want both the hauling capability of a small truck and the ability to haul four people easily.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the cargo space the most. I no longer have to rent a truck to haul larger items. My husband is tall so he likes the extra head room. I also like the higher seats. I don't feel like I am getting off of the floor when I climb out of it. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this 2009 1.8 4cyl / auto March 2008. I drive 50 miles a day and it has been good on gas 28-30 in town & 32-35 Hyw. The seats looked cheap so I bought some leather seat covers for $20.00 each and they been very comfortable. I have noticed the Paint is very cheap there are lots of chips on the hood ! A bicycle ran into the front when I was parked and pushed the bumper off to the side about 1/2 inch. I wonder how it would be in a real accident? We took a trip from Tulsa, OK. to Whittier, Ca. 3500 miles and had a very nice trip. The 1.8 cyl ran up over all the mountains with cruise control, on and the air conditioner on, and never slowed or had any problem. We're home safe and loved it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The electric assist steering and sports car like handling. The Fuel economy and the Price we paid - $14,000.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm echoing what CarParker already mentioned - he has said the best. It really is a sport hatch for the pragmatic. This car feels confident on the highway and quick in the city. I personally prefer the styling of this Matrix to a lot of its competitors out there. They did a great job with the front grill. The suspension is hard and the ride can be rough in the city, but this is expected from a car of this type. Nonetheless, the stability control works well. Brakes are excellent and the seat are very comfortable for me (I'm about 5'11 200 lbs). Comfort is a premium for me since I have issues with my knees for long journeys. Overall, this matrix gives you a smooth ride and great gas mileage. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plenty of cargo space with hatch, very reliable, looks great (I have the black sand pearl color), practical, good gas mileage, stability control, great pick up from dead stop, and a functional interior. This is a very good bargain.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned this car for about a month and my conclusion is I really like this car. Had an Accord prior and wanted to size down for more gas savings and better maneuverability with a small vehicle with good storage space. I liked the balance offered by the Matrix and thus far it has been a great little car. I got the 1.8 engine on purpose to save gas, and it is surprisingly peppy. I'm going to the beach and it's amazing what I can fit into such a little car. I'm having a blast!</TEXT>

<TEXT>No problems with this car in the 15 months I've had it. My only complaint is the way it rides on those low profile tires (45's). I think I have finally figured out the best air pressure for the best ride at 4k elevation. I've gone from the recommended pressure of 32 psi up to 35 and down to 30 and then 28. At 28, the ride was pretty good, but you could tell the tires were a bit soft as the handling was just a little mushy. Plus it's not really recommended to go that low as the tires can heat up excessively and cause a blow out. All this said, I've now gone to the other extreme and am running them at 38 psi, and this actually is the best yet. I think I'll leave them there.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I read a lot of tepid & dismissive reviews before I purchase the Matrix S. I've driven many of the cars recommended as alternatives. I think the problem is perception. The look of the Matrix is a bit sportier than its performance. But the gap between its main contender, the Fit, is even greater. If you accept that no one really cares what you drive, so don't rely on your car to define your personality, what you get in the Matrix is Balance. I think this balance is what confounds the automag pros. A little sporty, a lot practical, amazingly reliable. Design is Clean & Simple, Driving is Balanced & Poised. Quick & smooth without being completely lifeless. A sport hatch for the pragmatic.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the ground effects. The AC vents are great, a small detail but I detest vents that won't aim or stay put. I love the AutoStick. My wife can drive auto, and I can shift. Shifting works best 'clean'; rev it, get off the gas, shift up, hit the gas. It's nice to flip into 'D' if my cell rings.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As a previous Matrix owner I had certain expectations for the new model. My previous was a 2005 XR, my new model is the larger motor S with a 5 speed auto. The new model has much better pickup and feels more confident on the road. The downside to this is the fuel economy is lackluster. My best mileage when all highway miles was just at 30 mpg. My old matrix I averaged 30 overall with a lot of city driving, and had more than a few 36 mpg tanks. So far after only 5800 miles I've averaged 23 mpg with this car. For comparison, my old V6 Oldsmobile Alero got better mileage. I'm very disappointed in the fuel economy of the larger engine, I keep my tires inflated properly and drive conservatively.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine has much better acceleration than previous model. That is mostly from the larger engine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently came off a trip and the mileage I got with my Toyota Matrix was 40 mpg going and 41 mpg returning. It's no bull. I couldn't believe it myself. I never drove over 62 mph; used cruise control; and I was the only person in the car. The car operated flawlessly. I'm 73 and this is probably the best vehicle I have ever owned. I have owned many.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought an'09 base model 1.8L manual with power package June 1 of 2008 for 16K. Have 13500 miles on it. Smooth ride, smooth shifting, excellent stability control for cornering, excellent disc brakes, decent gas mileage (28-29 city and 34-35 highway), good cargo capacity (can fit my bike w/o taking wheel off), very readable dash, adjustable telescopic steering wheel, seat comfort lacking in lumbar support, poor paint job (easily scratches from road debris), and horrible rear visibility (almost didn't buy it because of poor visibility). Given price difference with a Prius, e.g. 16K vs 23K, I figured it was a better value. Glad I bought it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought a new Matrix. So far, I love the car. It drives well and with the larger engine, has great pickup. I am a large person, but with the extra headroom in the vehicle, I don't feel cramped. I think this car will meet and exceed my expectations for an economy vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the room with the seats down. The instrumentation is very similar to my last Toyota, I love just being able to find the windshield wipers, cruise control, gas flap opener, etc.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is an update to a previous review. I have had this car for 14 months now and 17000 miles. It still runs as flawlessly as when I bought it and the ride is still as harsh as it was at the beginning. It rides okay on highways or the interstate, but it's quite rough on less than ideal city streets. The suspension is quite hard. I mean the car barely moves when I push on the front bumper. I have not had the paint chip problem that many reviewers comment on. I have metallic paint on mine. I'm not sure if all models do, but my experience has been that metallic paint holds up much better. Other than the ride, everything has been good - build quality, handling, appearance.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Favorite features are the ease of getting in and out due to the height of the car and the handling which is very good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought this car and I am really enjoying driving and looking at it! I love the position of the stick and it is so much fun to shift. I thought I wanted the bigger engine but I find the 1.8 plenty of power. It is a great combination of fun, practicality and economy. You can't beat the deals Toyota is offering now. Way below invoice! Shop around if you can't get it. Great for driving the roads of the Wine County in Sonoma County. Come visit!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wanted a 4-door hatchback that got good gas mileage, was comfortable to ride in all day and had a good price. So far this car has pretty much fit the bill. We have 5,800 miles on it in 4 months. We are averaging 35 mpg. 75% interstate, 15% two lane roads and 10% city. Like that you sit up higher so getting in and out is easier. Did have some problems with paint chips on the hood until I installed a bug deflector on the front of it. On rough roads there is a lot of road noise that you can hear inside the car. Needs more insulation. Have a few rattles when on rough roads. I dislike the sound system. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Driving experience is fun for a crossover AWD vehicle. Ride is fairly smooth and build quality seems good other than a crackle and pop here and there. The car has ample power for a 158 hp 4 cylinder with all wheel drive, especially when driven in 3rd. Has plenty of room in it and versatility. The car has good looks inside and out, and definitely doesn't blend in with the ugly looks of some of it's competitors. The dash layout is very nice and sporty looking, and is easy on the eyes. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Matrix for almost nine months and my affection for it continues to grow. The Matrix is great for former SUV owners (such as myself) - it sits higher than your average sedan, and has a surprising amount of space. My first test drive sold me, as I found I had plenty of arm room and didn't feel cramped at all (unlike my test drive of a Mini Cooper, which felt almost cartoonish). But what really sold me is the styling - what a great looking car! My only disappointment is city MPG. Most of my driving is in stop-and-go city traffic, and I only get about 22 MPG. I chose the base model for fuel efficiency, but that aspect of the car has been slightly disappointing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just wanted everyone to know that in regards to collisions and air bags, Toyota may not be the safest way to go. I just had a full frontal car accident, where the air bags did not deploy. The impact was received at at least 35 mph and not one air bag deployed. I was able to walk away from the accident with minor pain, the car did not. Rescue crew was puzzled on why the airbags did not deploy. Just glad I was the only one in the car and the kiddies weren't there. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Matrix XR in May, 2008. I think the vehicle is comfortable, fun to drive and gets good gas mileage. Love the look of the vehicle as well. However, everything was fine until about 25,000 km. The alignment needed adjusting, windshield has a air leak somewhere, and the dash board also squeaks really bad when its cold. It's quite annoying. Had it in the dealership and they agreed something was wrong with the windshield. They removed the windshield and then replaced the seal. Noise is still there. My radio failed. New one on order. Hate the way the rain leaves marks on the interior of the seats.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've nicknamed our Matrix the "covered wagon" because of how horrendous the ride is. Every bump, pot hole, and dip is magnified many times over by the fact that the "sporty suspension" makes this car feel like it has no shocks whatsoever. It's loud, rough, and we regret the day we bought it. Spare yourself the pain and pass this one by.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the AWD Matrix since July 2008 and overall, I like the car. The AWD system has been very nice to have this winter, but at a high cost. I am averaging just 22 MPG on the highway, which is lower than expected. Next time i am in the dealership I am going to have them check for problems. Also, on very long drives, the seats can become a bit uncomfortable. When the car is wet, water from the roof spills onto the rear seat when you open the back doors.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a Sienna before this Matrix. The Sienna was the best vehicle I ever owned. I can't say the same for the Matrix. The first 6,000 miles were great, no problems. Then it got cold and the noises started. There was an air leak on the driver's window, the dash made noises, and it sounded like the windshield is going to fall out. Finally, the strut on the hatch failed. The dealer could not fix anything and they even made the problems worse. Toyota said they could not make the dealer fix the car, so now I have to make a several hour trip to get the car fixed somewhere else. I wish I would have bought a Honda!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I used to own a Chevy Blazer that was lucky to make 11 miles to the gallon at sale. Now I have a highly responsive 2.4L 2009 Toyota Matrix S Auto. I'm liking the option of shifting manual, especially when shifting down. It's a smooth ride on smooth pavement, but hit a bump and the whole car jumps (ka-wump). Hit some ice recently and the car kept going, ABS worked, tires didn't. At least I didn't spin around like the guy in front of me. Like a controlled slip. I recommend practicing driving on ice away from traffic first. Bottom line, not thrilled, would trade it in if I could find something better without paying more after trade-in. Would probably keep it if it never snowed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been waiting to test the AWD and I finally got my wish! Snows and compact ice has been all around the renton are for the past two weeks. This matrix AWD S has had no problems getting around. It is very controllable and predictable, even with a foot of snow with the standard AWD. Car is great in normal weather as well. Its great for hauling people around and lots of room for a "compact" vehicle. Road noise can be pretty bad, especially on the rough free ways in Seattle. The gas mileage could be a little better and/or a little large gas tank. Overall very pleased and glad i got it for this region. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Downsized from a Buick Century for economical reasons and am very pleased. The comfort & handling of the Matrix is beyond what I thought it would be. I am very satisfied with the 1.8L engine, it's enough for what I need, it has enough pick-up for passing, etc. Responds very nicely, turns tight corners, easy to park. Loved the colour choices... we picked charcoal gray. </TEXT>

Some of the interior rattles and feels like cheap plastic. The engine of the 2.4 has great pick up. I am concerned about the paint on the car, it appears to chip fairly easy.

<TEXT>I purchased my 2009 Matrix XRS 3 weeks ago, downsizing from a Highlander. I absolutely love it! XRS model comes with 18" wheels, that roughen the ride a tiny bit, but they handle beautifully, esp around turns. Great sporty look and feel. XRS comes standard with rear spoiler, helping to give the car a bit more ump to it's looks. Good interior room, easy controls. A few small blind spots in rear, but easy to get used to. I'm not at all disappointed with my purchase. I'd highly recommend the 2009 Matrix to anyone looking for a solid smaller car with great handling, good gas mileage and one that's fun to drive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving a Chrysler 300 for 2 years and filling gas up everyday I decided that I wanted a smaller car. I finally found the 2009 Matrix! After my test drive I was in love! The matrix interior was super comfortable and everything seem to be perfectly designed for the driver. The look is great and drives super smooth! I could have not asked for a better car! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I brought this after having a Toyota Camry wagon for years, and a Subaru Outback for past 7 years. In two months I have put only 1500 on it. I love this car, got 34 with NO AC on a longer trip, getting 20-22 around town. Both above EPA estimates for this 2.4 auto. Love the handling and pep, the styling is distinctive and attractive, many compliments. On the practical side, hey I never buy a vehicle I can't sleep in, and this is no exception with lots of room, love the folding FPassenger seat. Roofrack is study for bike. Its a sporty hatchback/small wagon, and a welcome change from poor mileage with Subaru AWD, which I do not need in Central Virginia. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Matrix replaced a 2001 Dodge minivan. We hoped to retain cargo flexibility, improve gas mileage, vehicle handling and reliability. With care in packing, the Matrix had ample camping room using a 10 c.f. soft carrier pack on the roof. Skis can be stored inside or on top. Gas mileage has averaged 30 mpg combined; 32 mpg- highway. The car is quiet, steering responsive, holds the road, suspension somewhat stiff, solid feel overall. For its weight, engine, and transmission combination, acceleration is quite good. Seating is comfortable with ample back seat room. The more I drive it, the more I appreciate its subtle qualities. A car to buy for long term value and not for instant gratification</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dashboard layout; cargo capacity with folding split rear seats. I like the stick shift, but mistakenly drove the 1st 900 miles in 3rd gear rather than Drive; a mistake corrected after reading of manual. Anti-lock brakes and side curtain airbags provide piece of mind. Like the exterior style.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> Being an Admirer of the Prius and the fact that there's a waiting list for one, I browsed the lot at the dealership I went to and I could not get over the awesome body style and "unusual" paint job (sunburst metallic). The thought of another six year car payment was dreaded but I'd moved from a 30 minute commute to and from work a day to a 65 minute one and I needed better gas mileage and a warranty so I decided to "bite the bullet" and managed to leave with a manual 09 Matrix S. Not for one moment do I regret it!!! The gas mileage is incredible (compared to my 01 Chevy Cavalier), It's very "giddy" in the speed department, Very maneuverable on the road and comfortable to drive...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking to downsize from my Tacoma since gas is so expensive and I went to look at Scions when the sport Matrix jumped out at me at the dealership. I never wanted to drive anything but a truck but this little car is really growing on me. The city gas mpg is so so but its a huge improvement from what I had, also I've already been camping in it and not only did it fit all mine and my GF's gear, we still had plenty of room for my 70lb lab to be comfortable and we got 30 mpg most of the trip. I like the re-design of the 09s over the older models, especially the aggressive front end. This certainly isn't my dream vehicle but I defiantly don't regret the purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Matrix has been a fun car to drive and I have enjoyed it greatly over the 2006 Corolla I traded in. I don't enjoy the 35 MPG that I did with the Corolla, but I have been averaging about 27. The car has pep as I easily find myself doing 80 in a 45 without noticing. I have been experiencing a vibration on the light console above the gear selector (Map Console?). The vibrations occur only when the sun is low or set, but will start even on a smooth road. I am chalking it up to thermal expansion of the roof when it is in the sun. Has anyone else experienced this? I can not get Toyota to fix because alas, the service department is not open when it is dark out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We sold our Honda Odyssey because it was getting terrible gas mileage. I decided to test-drive a Matrix as several others I know have a Matrix. I LOVE IT! The only complaint is the paint job seems kind of poor and scratches v. easily (silver is my color). But so long as it get 32 mpg and is dependable that's all I need! Great little car and fits me, my 6-year old twins and our 2 dogs just fine! I would not hesitate to buy one! Love the hatch-back too.

<TEXT>Have had the car for four months now and it's working out very nice. It now has over 7k miles on it and we just got back from a 4k trip. Gas mileage on the trip ranged from 27 on very hilly interstate to over 33 on flat interstate all with A/C on. At home we consistently get 30 to 32. We like the higher profile of the car and the ease of getting in and out. The headrests are a problem for short people (5') as we've had to turn one around to accommodate my wife otherwise it pushes into her head. We don't care for the low profile tires as they ride rather hard on the country roads where we live if inflated to recommended pressure (32 psi). They're better at 30. Like the 17" wheels though.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Multiple height adjustment for driver's seat. Power from the 2.4 engine and the gas mileage. Better than the EPA sticker. Cargo room even with back seats up. Held a lot on our trip. XM radio is great. Mudguards and cargo mat purchased as accessories, but well worth it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>1800 miles so far. Fun to drive. Feels like a sports car. Great for utility. Only slightly smaller in back than my 4runner. 2.4L engine is great but reduces mpg. I get 30 highway. 35 would be more to my liking. It's worth it to me so far though. 5-speed manual is fun but needs one more gear on the high end. A 6th speed (extra overdrive) is what it really needs. That would gain a few mpg and reduce revs on highway. This engine could handle it. Gas pedal seems to be on wrong angle for me (6' and slim). Right foot hurts if I drive highway too long. Always get a nice greeting when people see it, esp younger. It is a slick looking car. Clutch was jumpy for first 1000 miles, ok now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 2007 Yaris HB in on the Matrix. As a city car, the Yaris was great, but as a roadmaster, not so good. I test drove a Rabbit, which felt small compared to the Matrix, which seems bulk. The car has a heavy feel and is very comfortable on long drives. I am getting 29.5 mpg highway and 20 mpg city - exactly as advertised. The Matrix offers a lot of value for the money and I am pleased with my purchase. Compared to the Yaris, this car feels very solid and safe.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently traded in my 04 4runner sport for this car. During my car hunt, my biggest concern was the mpg so, I searched for a gas saver but didn't want to sacrifice looks and performance. I ended up with two choices, the jetta wolfsburg and the matrix. I ended up with the matrix given it was more reliable, cheaper on insurance and not too pricey to maintain. Overall I am satisfied with my decision. The looks are awesome both inside and out. I'm kinda disappointed with such a small fuel tank. I mean, I'm saving gas but finding myself filling up more often. I also think the ride is so-so. I don't know if it's just me but I feel every bump on the road which can get annoying but I can deal with it</TEXT>

<TEXT>Downsized from an 02 Ford Explorer. Off the bat, the 09 Matrix has greatly exceeded my expectations. First off, I ordered the car with extras: leather seats, 'darker' tinted windows, backup sensor, Perma Plate protectant. Uniquely original design for '09: dramatic outlines all around; SUV to CUV/stationwagon functionality. However, with 17" tires, VSC, AWD, 2.4 liter 158hp engine and 162lb feet torque (double cams), electronic steering, the car slices easily through traffic, and corners like butter. Handles road bumps with a rock solid chassis. Excellent fuel at 20/26 variable plus or minus 3 mpg either way. 5 Star metallic paint! "Black Sand Pearl".</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased just this week, sorry I cannot tell how good the fuel efficiency is yet. Purchased the AWD due to northeast driving conditions and because it handles like a go-cart! Steel wheels offer better ride than 17" alloys. "road noise" mentioned by others is the AWD, they are all a little noisy. Interior design is ergonomic, S model offers nice perks for little than $15k more. Recommend mudflaps and rear bumper protector (hatch step). I am 6' tall 220 lbs and with the telescopic column and adjustable manual seat I fit comfortably, arm rest could be 4" longer. Great pickup, car cruzes at 80 MPH without too much noise, stock radio is fantastic. 115V outlet is very cool for lap top charge.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently baught a brand new Toyota Matrix XR, and I have never been more impressed with a car then I am with this. The 2.4L engine is smooth and powerful, providing loads of passing and acceleration power. The interior and exterior are impressive, the exterior being sleek and sexy while the interior being easy on the eye and inviting. I've averaged 30+ mpg in mostly city driving. The steering is a tad numb, but that doesn't bother me as everything else about the car is totally amazing. The biggest selling point for me, being 6 feet tall and long in the leg,is that I can sit comfortably in the car thanks to vertical height adjustment for the driver's seat and a telescoping steering wheel.</TEXT>

Gas mileage so far is about 32mpg and that doesn't include any highway. The handling is amazing and it runs really quiet, hardly any road noise at all! Sound system is nice and the interior is positioned very well. The back seat is adult friendly and you can pack a ton of stuff into the back when the seats are down. This car is great, the best one we could have chosen for sure. There is nothing bad about it so far! Buy one, you'll love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We got this as a combination commuter and cargo hauler (for small jobs for catering & food business, deliveries). We use it in place of the van when appropriate. The back seats fold down COMPLETELY flat, allowing for secure storage w/o spilling sauces, etc. There is an incredible amount of interior space, especially given it's relatively small exterior size. The car (base model 1.8L) has plenty of power. No need to get the larger engine unless you like to really zip around. We get around 28 mpg (city/hwy. combined), much better than 14 mpg for the van.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turns very tight. Easy to drive, with all the ammenities we need. Easy to get into and out of (doors open in a way so you don't have to lift feet to get out).

I had a great purchase experience from the dealer, which is sometimes hard to believe from experience, but they were very helpful. I am 5'2 and the flexibility of moving the driver seat higher is a plus. It's easy to maneuver and getting the kids in and out of the car is so easy. Plenty of cargo space for a stroller, grocery bags and kids sport stuff. I am so proud of this car's practicality mixed with sportiness appeal. Thank you Toyota</TEXT>

A lot of time spent cruising at 80 mph. The car has decent pick up and go, it is not a race car, but it is enough to be comfortable.

<TEXT>I've had this car for a week and I don't want to get out of it! I held out for the 2.4L Matrix and it was well worth the wait. Handles great, corners great, steering is a bit numb but the acceleration more than makes up for it. The 4-wheel independent suspension and 18" rims sold me for the XRS model... a real head-turner. This car is the sportiest thing a 6'3" driver can fit in and still have some resemblance of a back seat left. Getting in and out is a bit snug but once you find your settings it fells like you are part of the car. Vehicle Stability Control does make a noticeable difference. I?ve been too excited to calculate MPG yet but all other features have lived up to the spec sheet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>All wheel drive really helped me out; we got a couple of inches after I got it and the AWD in combination with the vehicle stability control and traction control gave me a lot of confidence. Plus, you get like 6 airbags. I'm a big fan of the new look of the vehicle. I overlooked the previous generation, but after seeing a rally built version at the SEMA show, I was a big fan of the hatch. I've always loved hatchbacks! I couldn't decide between the AWD S or the FWD XRS; both have the multi- link rear, which gives it a much sportier feel. I decided on the AWD auto over a XRS auto or manual because I drive in traffic and need AWD for winter. Both have the Camry 2.4L 4 cylinder.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Matrix has a very cool look. The ride feels very smooth as a boat ride. The main reason why I bought the Matrix was to comfort my legs and so far it has done a very good job. Toyota really did a good job augmenting the standard options like the side airbags, trip meters, maintenance indicator, tire pressure indicator. I like that the driver seat can be adjusted vertically. I like that things are very accessible under the hood. I also appreciate the all wheel disc brakes making it easy for me to replace the brake pads when the time comes.
