<TEXT>Was driving an S-line A6 for past 2 years and while it was great it was too big for me. The Q5 has the luxury of the A6 and the nimbleness of the A4 all packaged in a functional SUV. I have wanted a mini SUV for years but they all look like 'soccer mom' cars until the Q5. That's what made the difference. The exterior is so aggressive and sporty vs 'cute'. One touch of the power hatch lift button and I can get my bike in the cargo area or pack up for a road trip. My husband wanted to keep the A6 and even he admits the Q5 is pretty cool. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Although a very good looking car and fun to drive at high speeds, this car transmission technology is still too new and Audi has not full control over it, I have a default transmission, and am not the only one, they have no right answers as how to fix it, they first exchange the mechatronics which has nothing to do with the jerking of the transmission in the lower gears, and after trying different things and not being able to repair the car their best solution is to replace the entire transmission in a vehicle that has less than 2800 miles. That to me as a customer is unacceptable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife in on her second Audi (first an A4, now an A6). I'm the "designated SUV driver" in the family. I had a 5 year old Nissan Murano, which performed well and was a good value, but I've always been jealous of my wife's Audi(s). I looked at several mid-sized SUV's as a replacement, but none compared with the Q5. It drives like a sport sedan, with all of the comfort and convenience of a SUV. The size is perfect for getting around downtown and parking spaces, but it feels very large inside. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The fit and finish are first class and have a high end feel, as is generally the case with Audi. The design of the interior can't be beat and overall, a very good use of space. Aggressive looking exterior. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car looks and handles great. It is fun to drive, has plenty of cargo space, and has a great sound system. I came from a Mercedes with every bell and whistle imaginable and with this car, don't miss it. I agree that the side mirrors are too big and take getting used to. I do also agree the the shifting of the gears when breaking can be a little jerky- I may just need to get used to it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2004 VW Touareg V8 with 125,000 miles. I love this new car. It drives like a dream, a sports car feel with the high ride of an SUV. The interior is simply elegant (I got the Cinnamon brown leather and deep blue exterior), premium plus with Navigation and 19inch wheels. My closest choice was the Volvo XC60, which is also a great car, but the MMI system on the Audi is just, well, cool. The volvo's nav feels very old school and clunky. My only criticism of this car is that when the back seats fold down, there is a gap across the cargo area that a dog's feet could get caught in. Also, the MMI phone system is a dial rather than buttons and plugging in for voicemail is a pain.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Elegant interior finish, comfort, smooth ride and tight steering. MMI system is awesome and voice control is pretty accurate and intuitive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 2009 Prestige Q5 rides like a sport sedan. Great acceleration (especially in sport mode), and responsive steering. I was really surprised on my first all highway trip (approx 75 miles), when I averaged 29.1 mpg! The ride is a bit bumpy on side street streets. Great access to rear storage due to low entry. Seats fold easily. Bang and Olefsun sound system is awesome. The GPS leaves a lot to be desired. The "point of interest's" do not let you choose ANY retail stores. Good luck trying to find nearest Home Depot, Staples, Target, or supermarket- NOT HAPPENING. The restaurant search is a basic listing- can't choose cuisine- Italian, Japanese, etc. My $200 Garmin GPS is far superior.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my sixth Audi and the second SUV. Although I love the Q7, I didn't need one that big. I traded it in for the new Q5 and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. Audis are very strong and safe cars to drive; they handle the roads so well; especially in these New England winters. There is a sense of security when driving them that I have not felt with other brands.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Previous car was a Subaru 08 STI 5 dr hatch. Speed, agility, utilitarian use best describes our needs. STI proved to be too low for driving on VT pot hole roads. So what was out there that would be fun to drive, quick acceleration, a great solid ride, not too fancy in appearance and interior, yet functional? My friends on facebook submitted their suggestions, this is how I came across the q5! In traffic, great visibility, amazing control maneuvering slow pokes. Quiet. An overall sense of being in your own world with its secure solid build. Great turning into parking spaces. The vehicle drives and feels small. We bought the premium model, base with some options which kept the price down. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Q5 after driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee for the last 5 years. I loved my jeep and hated to give it up but the build quality was poor and gas mileage was terrible. I wanted a higher quality vehicle that still could function as a SUV but drove well and offered better gas mileage. The Q5 fits the bill. The Q5 has a high ground clearance and decent cargo room. It handles great and I?ve been getting 25 MPG + at 75 MPH. The cabin is quiet, the seats are comfortable and the visibility is very good. This car provides great car performance with the functionality (functions you use 99% of the time) of a SUV. This is one of the best reviewed luxury SUV?s on the market and I can see why!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sunroof is amazing - especially sitting in the back seat! The audio is amazing with the SD and IPOD connections. Great gas mileage for an all-wheel drive vehicle. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Do not buy the MMI Navigation/Audio system unless you enjoy having it on every time you start the vehicle. You have two choices when starting your car. 1) The display comes on and the radio/media begins playing. OR 2) The display comes on with an Audi advertisement screen and the radio/media is off. Trying to blank the Audi advertisement screen causes the radio/media to come back on. You cannot start the car with the display and audio off. This is extremely annoying! I contacted Audi customer care. The representative verified this operation. I was told this operation is normal and they have no plans to fix it. There is no software/firmware update available to address this problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Amazing ride, quality and craftsmanship. Drove the X3 and XC60 and the q5 beats them hands down in all areas. Audi has really done a good job in engineering this car. My only complaint is that Audi should include more standard options on a premium plus. Bang and Olufsen, in my opinion should be standard on a premium plus. Heated seats are standard but currently there isn't an option for Cool/ventilated seats. They get really hot in the summer. For a 40+ thousand dollar car, one would expect more standard options. If there was a option to score on Value, i would give it a 7 or 8 simply because you can find more options for the price in Cadillacs, Lexus, Acura. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Took delivery of new Q-5 with Premium/Prestige Packages and immediately set out on 1,200 mile trip. Vehicle performed almost flawlessly. The GPS stopped functioning necessitating the rebooting of the MMI. Q-5 held the road well at speeds to 80mph. Gas mileage averaged a whopping 25mpg. Interior is well appointed. Everything about the Q-5 is solid. The B&O stereo is without equal. This is a great vehicle.</TEXT>

The only complaints I have are the gas mileage is kind of poor, and the leather seats are kind of hard and don't really hold you in them very well. The Navigation screen would also be better in a touch screen.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Audi and my first cross-over vehicle and I am thoroughly impressed with this car. Looked at a lot of different cars and nothing seemed to have everything I wanted until I drove the Audi. Very good power for a V6, handles well and has a very smooth ride. Great interior, good cargo space and the sunroof is fantastic. I've owned 2 Acuras, a 325 and 525 BMW and a Mercedes (which I'll never buy again), and this car meets and/or exceeds those. Better value for the $$ than the comparable X3 or X5 or Lexus or Mercedes. Better features than the Acura RDX. Really happy with the purchase and I highly recommend the Q5 for anyone looking in this class of cars.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Okay, this is my first review on a car. I have previously owned 3 Lexus, BMW, Acura, and Toyota's. This is my first Audi, had test drove the A4 when buying Acura and was not impressed, so almost did not even look at the Q5. Glad I did, this IS THE BEST CAR I HAVE EVER OWNED. Upside, engine is great, street from my house is a hill and a turn against oncoming traffic, the car provides the extra torque in the rear wheel for complete control, ALL other cars has issue with this even BMW 535i also 2009. Interior is extremely nice - I have nearly all the options so car price tag is $50k, which is appears overpriced at first, but when comparing quality interior and options is right on the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, Drive, and the NAV which is a small screen and I thought I would hate, is THE BEST NAV I have seen (compared to Lexus, BMW, Acura and Toyota), love the heat/cool cup holder.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The lease for my MB ML320 ended so I did some shopping around. I've tried Acura RDX and MDX and I had serious concern on passenger safety and lack of visibility. The same experience I had with Infiniti. MB GLK is really repulsive in design and BMW is still in the works to replace the outdated X3. Q5 was the best choice that I could have made. The design is outstanding, craftsmanship on the same level. Nice gadgets and the rooftop made my life so easy in convincing my wife: a 10 out of 10.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is such a big upgrade from our 2006 X3 (which we loved), I can only begin to describe it. Comfortable, huge acceleration, great steering, excellent visibility. Perfect car for our little family driving around the city. Plenty of room for car seats, strollers, groceries, etc. and looks good enough to bring out for a night on the town. Little nits: side mirrors are too big, auto-dimming rear view mirror dims too often, and brakes are a tad squishy for my taste. But, I love driving this car. Best car we've owned. By far. Including my BMW 328 (blasphemy!). Compared the Volvo XC60, Mazda CX-9, BMW X5, Acura MDX, Lexus RX350: this was a no brainer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Excellent all-around luxury SUV. Traded in our 2004 Volvo XC 90 (transmission problems). Looked at the Volvo XC60 and Lexus RX 350 among several others. After the dealer let us take the demo for a weekend we were sold. The ride is far more superior and has many luxury features in a very attractive package, inside and out. This car is just plain fun to drive and exudes quality. We are getting about 21 mpg overall (majority city driving).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Side assist works beautifully. MMI navigation system is the best on the market and really separated this car from the XC 60. Bang and Olufsen sound system is excellent. Panoramic sun roof is also fantastic. Like the temperature controlled cup holder and keyless entry/start.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Owned 2 Mercedes and it was time for a change. We looked at everything in this segment. The choice was easy, the Q5 won the battle hands down. Only had the car a couple days and love it. Got the premium plus package in meteor gray pearl. This car is completely amazing. This SUV drives like a car and sticks to the road better than the CLK we just turned in.

<TEXT>Premium Plus w/nav in Ibis White I had never really considered an Audi until I drove the Q5. It clearly is a well-thought out vehicle and very much fun to drive. Regular Drive mode leaves a little to be desired in first and second but Sport mode (and Triptronic) is where the fun is...0-60 in FAST! MMI is solid, cargo space may not be as large as some others but that was not a factor for me (don't have 22 kids and 3 dogs to shuttle around), gas mileage seems to be above listed, visibility is very good, steering responsive but not overly sensitive, braking is predictable, road noise is low even on 19s, and the most important factor is that it feels like a sedan and drives like one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had more fun driving this car than any car I have owned and I've had several sports cars. Put the transmission in "S" and punch it and it throws you back in the seat. We test drove the Volvo, Lexus, and MDX. This car was far superior! It was the only one that said, "Buy me"! Everything about it screams quality and luxury. We have been averaging about 19 mpg. I'm sure it would be higher if I could keep my foot out of it! It's just a super fun car to drive! We have the Prestige model--- definitely worth the upgrade!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought a Q5 Premium Plus with Navigation. Had to pay MSRP because the car is so popular right now - actually had to wait for almost 1 month to get the color I want. But Audi is now offering 2.9%, 36 months financing and will make my 1st 2 payments, so net net it is like 0% financing + $500 discount. The car is perfect for my wife. The handling is great and the interior is far superior than the X3 or the GLK. Love the LED lights and the huge side mirrors. My only complaint is the relatively small interior space, especially when compared to RX350. Otherwise, it was perfect. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My brother needed a new vehicle for work. He asked me for help. We researched and test drove all the competition. The Q5 was the clear winner. My local dealership had a hail storm and he was able to get his Q5 repaired and looking new for $8000 off the selling price (not MSRP). At such a deal I bought one also. His is black with tan interior and mine is white with tan interior. We both got the premium plus, but he also got the MMI package. No need for bigger rims or S- line for us. In two weeks he put 1500 miles on his Q5 and could not be happier.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car in April of 09 for my wife and I am ready to take it from her! The car is super fun to drive and especially so in the Sport mode. Has more get up and go than I ever expected. The transmission in the regular Drive mode can be a bit sluggish, but works fine. There is plenty of room in the car, I am 6 foot tall and the person behind me still has an adequate amount of room. Only had the car for a month now, but I am already a big Audi fan.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The MMI is great, 10gig of space on the hard drive for music and 2 SD slots. Great integration with my iPhone 3g, music and bluetooth. The bluetooth works great too, I can hardly tell when my wife is in the car. the sun roof is great too!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had the car two months and couldn't be more satisfied. I was regretting handing in my BMX X3 (still love that car) but the Q5 is more luxurious, more comfortable, smoother, better gas mileage, and just as fun to drive. I'm glad to see others here also getting MORE gas mileage than Audi disclosed. I am getting 23/28 vs. the Audi claim of 18/23. The better mileage + the larger fuel tank = less stops at the pump & a happy driver. The Q5 handles and drives like a state- of-the-art German sports car. Thru traffic, Manhattan streets, suburban highways and local driving, it gives a consistent and fun-tastic drive. And my passengers have no complaints either. Thanks Audi!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my new Q5 from Audi of Oxnard. I did extensive research prior to the purchase. I wanted all wheel drive for skiing plus a place where both my surfboard and lab dog could fit. I wanted comfort, bluetooth, nav, and pretty much all goodies. The full size moon/ sun roof is a cool addition. I replaced my 06 Acura MDX where the lease just ended. The Audi is extremely comfortable, with fit and finish second to none. Smaller than the mdx, but still o.k. and with better mileage. I got 23.5 on first tank, city and highway.

<TEXT>We've driven the Q5 (with Premium Plus) for a month and we absolutely love it. It's small enough for urban driving/parking, but is roomier and built more intelligently than the X3 that it replaced. Smooth, linear acceleration, balanced steering, and grips the road like a sports car. Our favorite drives are over the twisty canyon roads. MPG is around 17 so far (vs. avg. of 13 with the X3), which is better than expected considering almost 100% city driving. My only complaints are that the brakes are a bit squishy and the side view mirrors are huge. This is great for side visibility, but limits front visibility a bit when making turns, for example. I think we'll get used to it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought the q5 with the premium plus pkg, and it's FANTASTIC! The gas mileage is better than advertised. The LED lights are awesome! It handles just like a vehicle, but with the stamina of an SUV. I am 5"4 and this car doesn't feel 'too large'. The interior is classy, and goes above and beyond all of the competition. I have been looking for a year for an SUV (MB, BMW, Lexus), and nothing comes close to the genius Audi put together with the Q5. I leased this vehicle, but after driving it for 2 weeks, I am quite certain I'll end up purchasing it @ lease end. If you haven't driven the Q5, add it to the top of your list, this is one vehicle that is a must drive! </TEXT>

<TEXT>After trading in my 06 Jeep Grand Cherokee for a 09 Q5 Prestige, I can honestly say i would never buy an American car again. The Q5 is far better than the Jeep in every way, especially in the snow. We test drove this car during a snow storm and wow, the quattro is amazing. It would not let us fishtail or slide at all, and it just kept us going in a straight line. Aside from that, the MMI is pretty easy to use, the Bang & Olufsen sounds great and the panoramic sunroof is amazing, the whole roof is pretty much glass. Last but not least, the LED's both front and rear look incredible. They were one of the main reasons I bought this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my Infiniti M35X. Have always been a fan of Japanese car quality but decided to try a German car. The school commercial captivated my attention as I was considering an Lexus RX350. The commercial helped me to realize that I should try something not so main stream as there are a lot of Lexus RXs out there. One test was all it took to blow me away. The Q5 drives and feels like a sport sedan as handling and acceleration are excellent. The build quality is phenomenal. Seats are extremely comfortable. The gas mileage has been higher than advertised as I am getting just over 27 mpg on the highway (at 65-70 avg speed) vs sticker which claims 23. You can't get a much better car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just recently purchased the car. As an understatement, it is absolutely perfect. Excellent engine response and handling. The navigation system and audio commands are superior. I drove several competitors, i.e., Lexus X350, MB M500, Infiniti X35, and the Q5 is by far the best of the lot. If one is looking for a high performance Crossover vehicle, I HIGHLY recommend the Audi Q5.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded our Acura TSX for an Audi Q5 and could not be happier with the choice. The Audi Q5 does not handle like your normal SUV and it gives us better mileage so far in the City and on Highway driving with way more storage room than the Acura TSX and ability to haul more stuff. I would certainly recommend this car to anyone looking for a smaller SUV, a lot of fun, power and style.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This isn?t going to be your typical car review. This one is taking on a new twist, it?s from the front passengers viewpoint. MS took driving away from me 19 years ago, but I?m still more than able to be the judge of a vehicles stature and quality. Back in 2001 I purchased an Audi Allroad. It was an exceptional car, and always a ?head-turner?. We recently traded it in on a 2009 Q5, and so far we have no regrets. The quality, detail and build is typical Audi?"First-Class". Front seaters well over 6 ft in height have plenty of leg/headroom to spare. The 270hp V6 has enough punch to easily set you back in your seat. The shifting is very smooth and so is the ride. The Q5 also turns heads.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love that QUATTRO, it just loves curves, rain and snow. The MMI/Nav system is excellent and easily accessible. The LED running lights are a real nice touch. They help make the Q5 stand out from all other midsize suvs that you see on the road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I just purchased the Q5. It was quite a trade up from a Toyota Corolla. The interior styling is far superior to its Mercedes and BMW competitors. All three trims are great, and the Prestige is amazing. All three trims have the same engine - which has all the power we'd ever need. It has all the bells and whistles. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Panoramic Moonroof, Bang and Olufsen sound system. Simple, yet versatile steering controls.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I traded our S5 in on the Q5 and honestly the quality and build is the same. We've owned the Acura RDX and Toyota's Higlander in the past this vehicle is by far superior. We have owned BMW's before and looked at the X3 we are glad we waited. This vehicle gives us some of the performance we enjoyed in the S5 without all of the attention we got in the S5,we get some but not as much.It also gives us the comfort of the S5 with greater cargo space. You forget you're riding in a SUV. We've only had it a couple of weeks, we'll stick with Audi.I miss the B&O :( .</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The MPG in the city 23-26 Yes! On the highway 29.6 at 70 MPH and 30.5 at 65 MPH Yes! The third generation MMI/Nav is excellent and the handling. It's got to get better its not even broken in.</FAVORITE>
