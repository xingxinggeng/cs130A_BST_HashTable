<TEXT>Wow, what a fun car! I've owned lots of cars through the years but I've never owned one that could bring such a big smile to my face! The Cooper S has all the features one could ask for in a street legal slalom car! It handles extremely well, is balanced in turns, accelerates when called upon, and is willing to squeeze through tight spots where no ordinary vehicle will venture! Combined mileage has been 31 MPG and that's good with me. I just wish the engine didn't just sip high octane! I'm 6'-2" and fit very comfortably in either front seat (although I prefer the driver's side). The controls are not intuitive but they can be learned. Storage is what you should expect from a sub-compact. Tiny</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>IT&#039;S A MINI</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I started doing research and I drove the new VW CC, the Nissan Maxima and the Mercedes C300. But I wanted something different, something fun to drive, small, sportier, and unique. My solution: MINI COOPER S Dark Silver, Premium and Sport Package. I drove both the base MINI and the S and they are both fine but you can really tell the difference the turbo and the extra HP makes on the S, besides the few differences on the exterior which I find really cool. The MSRP is ar</TEXT>

<TEXT>As everyone else says, this car is extremely fun to drive. The "go kart" term gets used a lot but it's absolutely true. I traded in a Mercedes E350 that was nothing but trouble and have not regretted it once. The MINI is everything I hoped for and more. You just cant help but have a fun driving experience when you are in this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The salesman told me it handles like a go cart. I concur. He didn't tell me to expect better gas mileage than advertised. I get 30 mpg around town and over 40 mpg on the highway. Amazing. Very happy with this two seater, the back seat is a joke which I was prepared for before I decided on this great car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the blue tooth for my cell phone, always use the sport button for a little more pep. Very happy with the base engine using regular gasoline. Love the great gas mileage. Excellent ac.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Where do I start? This car so far has been such a pleasure to own and drive...and this is coming from a previous sport sedan owner. The "WOW" factor is definitely there...with impressive engine performance, great fuel econ and excellent driving dynamics. Apart from the performance factor, the design though polarizing to some is undeniably unique and the brand itself has a loyal and dedicated following with a large number of auto enthusiasts in the group. Finally the option to be able to customize this car to your exact specifications can be expensive yet a lot of fun. I have the "S" version which is a must for the performance oriented drive. Try the MINI....you will never stop smiling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted a combination of excellent performance with great gas mileage for under $25,000. This car is by for the MOST FUN car I've ever driven, and I have had my share of fun cars. The power and handling are very comparable to a BMW. The interior space is deceivingly spacious and although the rear seats are small, the back seats do not deserve the "overly cramped" reputation that they have earned, but you're not buying the car for the back seats. The turbo is more than adequate considering the car gets 34 mpg on the highway. There are a few negative aspects- the controls are not easy to use (radio, heating/cooling system) and the speedometer is in the center of the dash which is awkward.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Mini Cooper Hardtop for about a month now, and I honestly have to say without question it's THE most fun c.ar I've ever had (and I have owned a Firebird and a Camaro). I learned early that I have to be careful....once I was driving down a 35 mph street, and was shocked when I realized I was actually doing 89 mph!! Fuel economy is remarkable, and its extrior looks turns heads on the road.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I never thought that I would be impulsive and simply buy it because I had driven one during a trip to Europe. I have a Porsche Carrera 4 in my garage, and I find myself picking-up the keys to my mini more often than not. It drives like a dream: It hugs the road like the best, it is roomier than the expensive german brother, and it gives me 35 miles per gallon on the freeway. People complain about a small trunk space: They should buy an SUV. I play golf often and my clubs fit in the back with the rear sits down. If you want fun, reliable transportation, and great gas mileage: Buy a Mini-cooper S. If you don't like it, no problem you'll be able to seel it for almost as much as you paid.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has a Nice go cart feel but I think there should be a little more power. The exterior design is probably the worst thing about it, I don't think its bad but most of the people I ask say it looks like a clown car or some weird like that but I like it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the handing and fun factor on this car it really makes me fell like im in a race car. A other thing is the interior design its so cool its like nothing iv ever seen before. </FAVORITE>

The way it handled the looks you get when you roll up in a crowd. Great gas miliage. I got her the automatic in pepper White and she loves it! As a father I feel at ease when she is in her mini. A great car! Parents if you are looking to hook up the kid with a safe and cool looking ride just go test drive the mini and you will get one too trust me. My daughter still asks me is this mini really mine?</TEXT>

<TEXT>No it's not a 911, but it is surprisingly more fun. The quirky character starts with the handling and interior, and goes all the way to the company propaganda (love the 'always open' mantra and the crazy ads that go with it). I can pull more g's in the corners than i could with my 911 or boxster even on stock suspension & tires (love the incredulous look as i pass them on the curvy on-ramps). incredibly easy to manage the manual transmission - heel-toe downshifts are easy, rev-matching is much easier than the supercharged minis. averaging 29MPG with spirited driving+some stopngo.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>there's an ineffable fun quality that has made me take more pointless rides in this car than any other i've driven, including 911's, turbos, mercedes, etc. it's the combo of handling, transmission and pep. surprisingly good exhaust note. hill holder takes drama out of hillstarts. great mileage too!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Hi, I bought 2009 mini cooper S in late November. When I first bought it I loved the way it looks and the tightness of feel it gives when you drive. I now have about 16,000 miles on it, and had no single problem with a car so far. One thing I am very dissatisfied is this car tends to jerk occasionally when you press the gas gently. Seriously. Also even though I've heard model S has so much power and accelerates fast, I absolutely disagree. It really does not accelerate that fast from stop to 60 or accelerating while going. On the freeway, I always have hard time trying to cut other cars off without using sports mode. Even with sports mode, this car just does not accelerate that fast.</TEXT>

This car is very fun to drive, you will enjoy the driving. The MINI drivers are friendly, they smile to each other on the road. The car is small, but it runs very fast, you can easily reach 70mph on highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got my Mini yesterday, after doing months of research on several compact cars. The minute I test drove the Mini, I was sold. It is good looking, fun to drive and "just me". I am hoping it lives up to my expectations, but so far...it is everything I wanted! I got the red with white top and white bonnet stripes. CUTE!!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It fits me perfectly...small enough that I feel in control, yet big enough to fit my needs. I love the way it handles...and I really like the radio features that list the station, singer and name of the tune..I've never seen that before!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've never had more fun in a car than in my MINI JCW. It pulls hard from 2500-5000 RPMs, corners like no other, brakes instantly, and looks outstanding (mine's dark grey with a black roof). It's nice to be the envy of everyone on the road, especially others driving a Cooper or Cooper S. In fact, the sense of community with other MINI drivers is one of my favorite aspects of the car. I was fortunate enough to be in a financial situation where I could afford the JCW, and the slight performance increase (and I mean slight - it's not much) and exclusivity factor made the extra money worth it. HOWEVER, for anyone more sensible than I, the Cooper S is plenty fun and very much less expensive</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exhaust note is perfect, the exterior is gorgeous, its handling is unparalleled, the acceleration is blindingly quick, and the waves from other MINI owners are awesome, but when I walk outside tired and grumpy every morning and re-realize I commute in this car, my day becomes infinitely better.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have wanted one since I saw the Italian Job. I decided to buy one for myself for my Birthday last July. I had to wait 14 weeks for it, but it has definitely been worth it! I got it with the Premium package,the Cold Weather package, Nightfire Red paint and black top/ bonnet stripes. Love the heated seats and mirrors during the cold northern Ohio winter, and have been loving the dual sunroof this Spring/ Summer. I must say, I was a little concerned about the upcoming Winter, but the Mini was a dream to drive in the snow as well. We got hammered a few times last Winter with a foot or more of snow, and the Mini handled the snow better than the Chevy and the Toyota I had owned previously. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have about 3000 miles on this car with, thus far, no defects. I bought the car because fo the retro looks, handling, fuel economy, and relatively low price given the abundance of features. I was correct in all these suppositions but greatly underestimated how disagreeable the ride is. Even after abandoning the pathetic runflats for top rated normal performance tires, the ride is jiggly under all conditions but the smoothest roads. Now those of you not bothered by this and there must be many, fine. However, this is by NO MEANS a discounted BMW. BMWs work magic somehow in the first 10 cm of suspension travel, soaking up road inperfectis while keeping phenomenal traction. This is no BMW</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the car, hate the electrical bugaboo that has caused it to change abruptly from full on function to stone cold dead. It's up to the dealer at this point to convince me that this can be resolved. I hear they get high marks for service that's customer oriented, so far they have been, but the electrical issue is still there after stranding me the first time. Disappointing because we really like the car, the dealership is trying but I hate the idea of always wondering about electrical issues that are supposedly resolved. We'll see... </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling and the sense of control the car's design gives the driver. Road feedback is impressive, yes it's small when mixed in with the typical monster SUV, at the very least, the car gives you the feeling you can drive your way around the elephants with little problem...</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I saw a MINI probably 10 years ago, wanted one ever since-the night before picking up my MINI concerned I might not like it as well as I hoped -- on the ride home (2 hours from the dealership) I love it more than I could've imagined - - Fall in love with it every morning all over again on my 25 mile commute There's no comparison of the pep of this 4cyl to any American made 4cyl or quality of the overall car -I've driven GM vehicles for 35+ yrs before this car, I think I understand why GM is having finanical difficulties, "sorry GM" I didn't take the decision to buy foreign lightly buying US was instilled in me as a child, but unfortunatly I couldn't find anything even close made by US mfg</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car! Let me start by saying that I'm 6'4" 250 and I have plenty of space. Took it on a trip from Detroit Michigan to Naples Flordia 3 months after taking delivery. Averaged 35-MPG for the trip and was comfortable for the 21 hour trip. Turned heads the entire trip and was just a blast to drive. This is my first MINI as well as my first small car and plan to keep it for a long time. Used to lease large SUV's or trucks in the past, but no more. I love my MINI!</TEXT>

I am 6' 2" tall and I have more headroom in my Mini than many vehicles I have driven. The fuel economy is great! I average 35 - 40 MPG around town. My Mini only has three options (speed control, bonnet stripes and checkerboard mirrors) and it was well worth the $20,000 price tag.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A home run; why can't US car companies build something like the MINI? We paid right at $30K for the car and feel like we got a bargain. The new MINI retains some British charm but really should be regarded as the smallest member of the BMW lineup -- it looks and feels incredibly solid for a small convertible. My wife says she feels like she's behind the wheel of a baby tank. Our "S" cabrio w A/T is returning 31 MPG in mixed city/hwy driving to date. What a combination of power and fuel economy -- way to go BMW/Peugeot! Way, way bigger inside than it looks from the outside -- I'm 6'2" 200 lbs and very comfortable in drivers seat. Trunk is tiny, but useful w/back seats folded down.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1. "Sport" button transforms the "S" into a snarly little sports car by tightening shift points & steering. 2. Great wide power band at any speed -- NO discernible turbo lag. 3. Power top operation is a thing of beauty.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I absolutely love this car. I got it loaded and it has all the amenities of a luxury automobile along with the sportiness. I was shocked and sold when I sat in one and it was extremely comfortable and roomy. Get a convertible or a sunroof because they operate great. It gets great gas mileage and all maintenance and the entire car (Including paint and body) is guaranteed for five years. I don't have to change the oil or nothing. All i have to do is put gas in it and that isn't very often. What a wonderful car!</TEXT>

The S makes it move quick and the manual trans. gives you the controll you beg for. You can't go wrong with these vehicles. This is my Second Mini and I just can't get over the QUALITY that is put into these vehicles. They say the S does 138 @ top speed.

<TEXT>I recommend that before you purchase a Mini you have access to top tier premium gas stations, such as Chevron and QT. If you live out in the countryside, as I do, be aware that using other than above mentioned gas will destroy your fuel pump system. Premium quality gasoline does not mean top tier...there's a mixture in other stations that may destroy your engine. Neither the Mini Cooper website nor the Consumer's Report website made any mention at all about this extremely important concern. I was able to find a station within a 30 mile round trip from my home. Again, think this out very well before you consider purchasing a Cooper!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Drove the Civic SI, MazdaSpeed3, GTI, A3 and R32 before finally ordering the Cooper S. If you don't go crazy with options MINI is reasonably priced. Engine is hugely satisfying at any range while still averaging 28 mpg combined cycle and has great resale value. The options list is as huge as a 911s which costs 4 times as much. There are tons of options for after-market parts. I love the free maintanance program.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Brakes, steering response, sport button, lack of body roll, gas mileage. I love the fact that you can still look cool and hip in one even if you drop a few grand and make it a track-ready car. Interior mood lighting. Plenty of space for driver and passenger. HI-FI stereo is well worth the money. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A nice, solid car. Enough power to hold it's own against the big guys. The leather sport seats are very comfortable -- I did an 8 hour trip a couple of weeks ago, and could have easily done another couple of hours that day. Average mileage has been 38 city / 43 highway. I had the same windshield washer issue that JMS mentioned. However I found that the nozzles are adjustable and was able to redirect the spray back to the windshield (as opposed to the roof of the car!)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The little extras, like the warning light that comes on when the outside temperature drops low enough to freeze the roads.
