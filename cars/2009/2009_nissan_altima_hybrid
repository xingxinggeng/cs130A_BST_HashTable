<TEXT>Bought this car after looking at the 09 Accord EX-L. The Altima is more sporty, quiet, and more fun to drive. Not to mention the excellent gas mileage. With the current Nissan rebate of $3250 and tax incentive, the price is hard to beat. You will not be disappointed in this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hybrid system and handling. Great looking car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Altima Hybrid is a true Jekyll & Hyde. It saves me gas and its sporty and fun to drive. It has enough room for my family, I can stretch out in it and it looks great. When the spirit moves me and I just have to get away fast I hit the pedal to the metal and the electric motor feels like a supercharger as it pushes the 2.5 over 100mph!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The hybrid system of course, and the looks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Extremely disappointed - first and last Nissan. Vehicle initially worked fine for first month than began to shake violently when going into EV mode. Dealer "fixed" it but now it will not drive in EV Mode. Been back to two separate dealers both of which say its normal. First said it has "learned" my driving habits so it won't drive in EV the second claims EV does not work when the air conditioning is on (doesn't seem to work with it off) 6,000 miles on it and am ready to unload it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I thought I was going to buy a 2010 Prius. I was just waiting for the right one to become available when I happened upon the Altima Hybrid. What a stroke of luck! It is so much more car for less money, as it turned out. The Altima I got is fully loaded, and is a GREAT car. It drives beautifully, with power when you need it, and little road noise, lots of comfort and great handling. I marvel at the technology that has gone into this car. Truly remarkable. I highly recommend this car to anyone considering a hybrid. At least give it a test drive! The mileage is pretty good (35 mpg so far), and the tax incentives are great $2350 federal, and $1500 state (OR). Nissan is making great deals now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Honestly one of the best "eco" cars we looked at. After considering a Prius and a Jetta TDI, we went with the Altima and could not be happier. Although the fuel economy of the prius would have been better, it doesn't have the comfort or size that the Altima has. BOSE audio sounds great and is the best audio system of all the others we looked at. Altima also handles and drives better overall than any other hybrid we looked at. Overall, we could not be happier with the Altima because of its great performance and how fun it is to drive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a new owner and very pleased with first month of driving. I am 6'5" an 275# - too big for most cars and so have been driving vans/pickups - but I tried an Altima at an autoshow and found I fit great in this car. I have only owned for a short time but so far the Altima Hybrid performs well, has a quiet comfortable ride, gets good mileage (now averaging 31+mpg driving aggressive) , it seems to have good build quality/materials - I got convenience package only. I also think it is remarkably fun to drive - far more sporty and quick than my wife's non-hybrid 4-cyl Accord. Also runs in whisper quiet EV mode up to around 25-30mph - which is lots of fun on twisty rural backroads. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>best leg room/head room combo in a mid-size sedan, fun to drive, smart key is nice, EV mode has good torque and is silent. Green & fun.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>disappointed</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I just bought the car less than a week ago. I was too stupid, didn't realize the problem when I was test driving it. Whenever you try to slow down or hit the brake, it actually sounded like an ambulance or police car siren 800 feet away from you. The dealership was in a quite busy neighborhood, so I really thought there were police cars or ambulance around or down that street, not until, I bought the car, and drove home and drove in my nice neighbor realizing that sound is from stepping on the brake. I brought it back to the dealer, they can't do anything about it, and I am stuck with this brand new car with horrible sound. Don't ever buy a Nissan car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had the hybrid for 1700 miles. It has greatly exceeded my expectations. I am getting 38.3 mpg and as the engine breaks in, I expect it to go higher. The list price of $29k was a little steep, but with $3250 cash back by Nissan and a $2350 tax credit, I was able to get this vehicle, with the Convenience package for under $21k.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought new 09 NAH. Plan is to keep the car for roughly 8 years so chose the best value considering cost over that time frame (gas, maintenance, tax credit, rebates/incentives, invoice). Toyota Camry-H (TCH) and NAH were top contenders. $2350 tax credit pushed NAH ahead and Nissan was aggressive in rebates - chose NAH (fully loaded). Engine shifts to gas very quickly during acceleration. The car doesn't go to hybrid mode quickly when the engine is cold even on a hot sunny day after work. Adjusting my driving (longer brakes, slow acceleration, maintain cruising longer - I get about 33-38mpg. aggressive driving 24-28, normal driving 28-30mpg in city (25mph-55mph roads), freeway about 35mpg</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am 6'5", and it was very hard to find a non-SUV hybrid that fits me. This one did. In fact this is the only one that did. The result is that I needed to drive ~120 miles to NJ to get one since they are not available in my home state of Maryland.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We chose the Altima after looking at both the Prius and Camry hybrids. Glad we made the choice. Car rides smoothly and is quiet. Mileage is great for a car of this size if you're easy on the pedal. Consistently get 33 - 36 mpg all around. Extremely disappointed with the Technology Package. Definitely not worth it. The Nav system often suggests longer and less direct routes. Our little $150 Garmin does a much better job. The built-in Blue Tooth is virtually useless for dialing out calls. My little $30 ear piece does a better job. Sound system is great. The fiber-glass bumpers are cheaply made and easily damaged. I backed into a curb at less than 3 mph and cracked the rear bumper.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good gas mileage around town. Comfortable and quiet ride. Great styling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I only visit the gas station once every two weeks now, which is half as often as I did with my 2004 Acura TSX. I opted for the fully loaded tech package so I have all the goodies..navigation, Bose, rear back- up camera, etc. I think I enjoy the performance well enough for a hybrid.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I carefully considered the Honda and Toyota Hybrids. Personally the style of the available brands next to the Altima was no comparison, with the Altime clearly the winner in style, speed, great gas mileage, price, space and features. Altima appearance to me is far superior inside and out. I moved from a Camry due to a total loss accident to the Altima Hybrid for all of the reasons I just mentioned and the superior crash ratings the Altima has. Drive everything else first, then get into an Altima. If you like features, speed, a comparable price and style that turns heads everywhere you go, the Altima Hybrid is the clear winner. The tax credit and being "green" is a winner in any city.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The main selling point for me was the fuel economy and emissions. The NAH is rated one of the five top-rated cars for fuel efficiency and emissions at the EPA web site. After driving the car for a month, I believe I made the right decision. It doesn't feel as "floaty" as some of the more luxury cars that I test drove, but has much more power and better handling than the other hybrids I drove. While it doesn't get as good mileage as the Prius or Honda Civic Hybrid, it's much more enjoyable and comfortable to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good mileage and emissions. Bose stereo sounds great. Keyless entry. Engine/road noise not bad.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got base model for $21995 after rebate, incl destination fee. If the price hadn't been so low, the fuel benefit wouldn't have outweighed the added cost. LOVE it. The accel. is as good as my old accord, & better than my wife's civic. Poor Braking distance is non- issue; it feels like it can stop on a dime, even at 3500 lbs. The eCVT is ideal; I have never driven a continuous transmission. Has abundant safety features for my family, and I was even surprised that alloy wheels are standard (although I don't know the added benefit of alloys, just that they cost more). A small thing I love is the key. Just have it in your pocket, & you can open the trunk, unlock doors, & start the car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a blast to drive. The MPG on the first tank was 36.5 for over 300 miles, both city and highway driving (Nissan promised 34 mpg combined). The design of the inside and outside of the car is wonderful. My only complaint is that we did not buy this car earlier. We purchased this car with every toy possible.</TEXT>
