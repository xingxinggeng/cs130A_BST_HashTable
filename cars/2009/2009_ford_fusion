<TEXT>I've owned my Fusion for over a month now and have 1,200 miles on it. Ride is nice and has a very responsive steering system. The trunk is large and the gas mileage has been decent @ 25mpg. The V6 has good power and the transmission shifts smoothly. The headrests are not comfortable and need to be redesigned, hopefully they got it right on the 2010 model. Overall, I am very happy with it and we chose it over the Camry, Accord and Sonata. It was a tough decision but so far so good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 8th car, 2nd new car and first American made car. Initially I was elated with my purchase and glad that I decided to buy American. I drive 100 miles round trip 5 days a week. The drive home in my roomy and comfortable Fusion was something I looked forward. And I only have to buy gas twice a week. Fast forward 10 months,I just had to get a new transmission and I am going online later to find a condenser. The condenser issue really could have happened to anyone,(so they say)a little rock bounced into it . It is just annoying that it happened 3 days after the transmission was replaced. Now everyday I dread the ride to and from work, wondering what will go wrong next</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 2009 Ford Fusion is a smooth roomy drive. I love the seats and the trunk space.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased a 2009 SEL I4 in April to replace our minivan. My wife loves the size, maneuverability, and fuel economy. I rated the performance lower, but we did pick the I4 for fuel economy. Loads of room in the back for two growing 'tweens with plenty of leg room for me in the front. Anyway, Frannie (our name for our Fusion) took a direct hit centered on the driver and rear door. The airbags deployed, the B-pillar was crushed, the C-pillar and roof line were creased, and the doors look like used aluminum foil. However, my wife walked away with only some bruises from the seat belt, which she felt clamp down. We are currently shopping for a 2010 Fusion or its sibling, the Mercury Milan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Since 1999 My wife and I have owned 3 Honda Accords, 1 Toyota Camry and I can confidently say the Fusion is the most comfortable, best handling and performing of them all. I would not think twice to make this purchase again. Our other car is due for replacement next year and we will be closely looking at another Fusion as well as the new Taurus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The quality of my 2009 Fusion has been extremely good so far. The ride is very nice and the performance is great. Fuel economy on my I4-SE has been slightly above what the sticker stated and I do not drive like my grandfather....although I use the cruise consistently. The more I drive this car, the more I like it. I know that sounds corny, but I drive a miriad of vehicles and the Fusion is my favorite. We looked at several other makes and actually decided on the Fusion because of price. After getting the car, driving it and feeling the quality of the ride, I am totally happy with the car. I think Ford hit a home run with the Fusion.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my new Fusion in January after driving the Focus and I4 Fusion. I miss my Ranger but I love this car. I fell in love with the handling, interior design, great looks during the test drive.It has many nice features, including the heated seats ,that my wife loves, and the dashboard storage and sunglass compartments. I drive 75 miles round trip to work and I am averaging 27 MGH week in and week out. I love the way it handles. It hugs the road. The V6/six speed is very responsive and smooth shifting. For those of you who are considering a mid-size foreign car I highly recommend you test drive the Fusion before you decide. You won't be disappointed</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought as a daily driver to work and back. After 4000 miles it has become a great car to own. This car replaced my 1998 Taurus. With a V6 I average 29-30 miles to the gallon, if using 10% ethanol blended gas then 26-27. 0% for 72 and invoice pricing made it a great deal. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the '09 Fusion back in May and got the 0% financing and I'm extremely happy with this car. It has a smooth drive and for the price, gives me options that Honda, Toyota, and Nissan couldn't match. V6 has great pick up, especially for getting on the highway. The sync is great too that hooks up to my cell phone. Clarity on the other end of the phone is really good too, no complaints from who I'm talking to. Not to mention this car turns heads and people from my office are shocked that it is a Ford. Overall I'm extremely happy and no problems so far with with 2,500 miles on it. The only negative would be city MPG's (18), but that goes with the V6. I highly recommend the Fusion. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased a 09 4 cyl Fusion for 18K...I know the 4 cyl is not the fastest, but not bad for a four...especially with the 5 speed automatic. I just drove drove 500 miles home and averaged 32 mpg @ 70 mph, This engine not even broken in yet, so mileage should improve a bit. The car is very quite on the highway and quite comfortable. My last car was a Cadillac, so I appreciate quality. This car was loaded with the sun & sync package, black leaather interior with blue suede inserts, ambient lighting, travel computer with compass sport package with 18" rims, cruise, 8 speaker premium sound system with 6 cd changer, satelite radio with steering wheel controls, power seats, rear spoiler.</TEXT>

All I can say is the Ford Fusion should be renamed Ford Sweetness!

<TEXT>When I saw that Consumer Reports recommended the 2009 Ford Focus and Fusion I decided to check them out. Previous cars I have owned have been Subarus and Hondas. I ended up helping my daughter purchase a new Ford Focus and I ended up getting the 09 Fusion. I have been VERY satisfied so far. Great ride and my wife and I love the room in the interior, the great sound system and the SYNC system. What really clinched the deal, however, was the $3500 incentive on top of a great deal that was just $400 above the invoice price. I ended up purchasing a new ford that had a MSRP of around $23,00 for $18,000. Good Job Ford!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was advised to buy the V-6 vs the V-4 for more power. This vehicle gets up to speed very quickly. Steering and handling is very good. Other reviews disliked the turn indicator position (high on column) and height of seat head rests. I do not find this a negative. A great car and my wife loves it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I switched to Ford since they didn't take bailout money and I am happy so far. The engine is noisy when accelerating but smooth on the highway. It seems like 1st gear is too low since it shifts to 2nd at about 10 MPH in normal driving. Gas mileage has averaged 22.5 in mixed driving. My kids like the ambient interior lighting, moonroof, and sirius radio. The maintenance manual shows oil changes every 7,500 miles which is more convenient than 3,000. This is one of the best rated american cars for reliability so I am looking forward to years of hassle free driving</TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded our 2006 Ford 500 for the Fusion and it was a great switch.Just turned 1000 on the odometer on have enjoyed the car tremendously. We went with v-6 after trying the 4, just to noisy.The ride quality is better than the 500.The only negative so far its been pulling to the right when braking will contact dealer for fix.Other than that I would say give it a try.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, the car is a good choice, however. I would put it in the top 10 in mid-size sedans, but it would be hard to squeeze it into the top 5. Consider the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord, Chevrolet Malibu, Hyundai Sonata, or KIA Optima as better alternatives. The ride is smooth and fairly quiet. The engine is powerful enough, and the transmission shifts, precisely. Some of the controls are a little oddly placed, and not so easy to use on the steering wheel. I much prefer controls that feel natural to use. Gas mileage is good for a six cylinder in this category. I averaged 24 mpg, combined. Ford?s SYNC system is nice, but not the most user-friendly equipment.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The SYNC system is pretty cool. The appearance of the car may be a little on the ordinary side, but it still looks sharp. The fit and finish illustrated Ford's ability to build with quality.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had a hard time deciding but finally went with the v6 Fusion SE. I have to say so far I am very pleased. The car handles particularly well and the braking is excellent. It is roomy inside even though it appears to be a smaller car from the outside. The 3.0 v6 has plenty of power although I can notice the difference coming down from a 3.8L. Ford appears to understand how to compete with the Toyotas and Hondas. I would rate this car with either of them. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the Sync even though it is a little challenging to set up. Once you get it going, it is great. I also love the dashboard storage compartment. Mine is black, both interior and exterior which I love. My backseat passengers say it is very roomy in the back. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After looking at Honda, Hyundai, Toyota, & Chevy alternatives I chose the Fusion. I've been driving the car for nearly a month. No regrets so far whatsoever. This car is fun to drive! My commute is 45 minutes each way so I've got to know the car pretty well. With the V6 I regularly get 28 mpg, and with the sync system and sirius radio I'm entertained like I've never been. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync is awesome! This car has a very quiet ride, quite a bit quieter than the 99 Honda Accord it replaced, I hope it lasts as long! First car I've ever owned with a sunroof, and I'm liking that too! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looked at all the competition for this vehicle; Accord, Camry. Mazda 6, Sonata, Malibu and chose the Fusion. Had the most room and most comfort up front for a big tall buy that was tired of small cars. It is a blast to drive with a nice combination of power and comfort. Very nice fit and finish for the money with a host of nice little details that makes it fun to show off. Very nice Black paint job matched with the black leather and blue suede interior that my wife just loves. Overall can?t beat what you get for the money and Ford has matched the import quality in look and feel.</TEXT>

<TEXT>One test drive and I knew. Having already tested Camry, Accord, Subaru, Altima and Mazda 3, I thought I'd see what Ford had done with the Mazda 6 chassis. I'm happy to say that they hit a home run! Smooth, quiet, and plenty powerful even in the Colorado mountains, the AWD with traction and stability control makes this thing a blast to drive on the twisties. It handles ice and snow with a surprising (and reassuring) aplomb. I am proud of myself for making the right choice.

<TEXT>After 32 years I thought it was time to try another American car. I've been driving Toyota, Honda, and Lexus all these years. Since Ford's quality has improved significantly over the past few years, I thought I would take a serious look and drive one. Well, I was impressed and bought the SEL pretty well loaded including 18 inch wheels. The V6 and 6-speed auto are very smooth and I'm averaging 22 MPG after six weeks of driving half city, half freeway. The sport tuned suspension makes handling very acceptable and the car has a very solid feel. In summary, this is a very nice car and a great value. It also feels good to drive a car made by an American company.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The voice activated Micosoft SYNC is excellent. My IPOD is stored, out of site, in the center console where it's connected. SYNC also makes telephone calls so easy. SYNC coupled with a 6-CD player, satelite radio and driving can be a pleasure no matter where you are. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Originally reviewed after one month. So thought I might give a 6 month update to let people know what I thought after the "newness" has wore off. Currently have 8000 miles and have not had to take the vehicle in for warranty work, but I do have a few rattles and one clunk that will probably be warranty repairs at some point. My "clunk/rattle" sound is the most annoying at this point and only happens when going over somewhat larger bumps/humps in the road and seems to originate from the passenger front when I do hear it(my wife calls me a freak for rattles). Other than that the vehicle is still fun to drive and I'm getting 27mpg with 50/50 highway/city driving. I still get excited to drive it</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>5 speed manual. Sync is very convenient. I have had several friends comment how quiet the car is at highway speeds. Price new was still a deal!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has put the word fun back into driving especially for a family mid-size sedan. I love the way it handles. It has great pick and go. I normally lease cars and have leased 8 different cars (both domestic and foreign) over the last 12 years and this is by far the best vehicle I have driven in the mid-size category. Ford has made a great mid-size car and it's about time. I purchased this vehicle and plan on keeping it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car to replace my venerable 2001 Mustang, which I loved dearly for 120,000 miles. The Fusion will not turn heads like the ol' Pony, but it will give you a quiet, comfortable, and reasonably sporty ride, plenty of toys, and good passing power with the V6. It also comes with a heaping portion of practicality. The trunk is vast, rear seating is comfortable, and I have been able to squeeze 31 MPG out of the V6 in pure highway driving. This is a great car for long road trips. If you're looking at mid-size sedans, don't forget to try a Fusion. You're in for a pleasant surprise.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable and well styled SEL interior. Audiophile stereo (which I believe is made by Pioneer) sounds far better than Chevy's upgrade or Toyota. Full iPod integration via USB is almost perfect. Navigation is a pricey option, but it really completes the car and it's not available in the Malibu.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It is fun to drive, feels solid, and I would recommend it and would buy another. I'm getting 21-22mpg in town and 29 highway but haven't put a lot of miles on it. 4 cylinder engine has plenty of power for me, 16 valves move! Lots of standard features that used to cost extra. Standard CD is great system. It did well on ice with FWD. It corners very well at 60mph. I disagree with most nit picks by other reviewers. Prices good now with 2010's out soon. My only option is automatic transmission. Controls good, well placed and easy to use.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Standard CD stereo system great. Comfort,handling, quality solid appearance and feel. Automatic transmission smooth and upshifts for better mileage. Trunk doesn't fly up when opened. Large trunk and fold down rear seats for hauling. USA company. Great heater.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Was looking for gas mileage (priority) in a sporty fun car. Considered the Honda Fit, Civic, Toyota Corolla all with the sport package option. When I looked at the Focus it didn't fit me well. The salesman directed me to the midsized Fusion, I knew it was my car! The only hesitation was the advertised MPG. I drive rural, highway and city about 60 miles a day. Now after 6000 miles I get about 27.5 MPG combined driving. Highway alone about 31.5 MPG. I am very happy with the Fusion. It looks good and it is fun to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The red stitching on the steering wheel and seats got me! Tuxedo black really shines. 4 wheel disc brakes, moon roof and great stereo, Sync is cool. Sport package (wheels and rear deck lip) Handles great with the "sport tuned suspension". Auto dim rear view mirror. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When you sit in the car it snuggles you in and prepares you for a smooth ride. Acceleration is quick and smooth. The hum of the engine sounds similar to the Mustang. I really like this car. I've owned a 2000 Camry, 2004 Dodge Stratus & 2004 Nissan Sentra--none comes close to the sleek and smoothness of the Ford Fusion. I look forward to buying a new one when this one is paid for! The Ford incentives are great right now. Don't let this car slip by you!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior/interior styling is great. The 6-disc cd changer, Sync Media & 2-power points are great. I have Tuxedo black exterior and black interior and it is sharp. Powered drivers seat is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 20 years of regular cab 2wd trucks, I could finally buy myself a car. Ink Blue Fusion with the Blue Suede package,4 cyl, 5 speed and Sync. At 1500 miles it's fun to drive, laid out well, gets 29 mpg on the hiway and is just plain comfortable to be in. Everything feels tight. It handles well and the suspension is firm enough without being rough. Drove 780 miles in a single day and never hurt anywhere or really had to stop other than for the normal reasons</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The leather/alcantra seats and the package that comes with them. The big wheels and tires do make a difference.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2006 Honda Accord EX on a 2009 Ford Fusion SE with Sport Package. The Fusion handles better than the Accord, has just as much power, and the build quality is just as good if not better than the Accord. In addition, the car is fun to drive. For the price you cannot beat the Fusion.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove several brands and decided to try a Ford last of all as I wasn't really convinced I would want one. The dealer cash incentives were too big to ignore however, and once I drove the car, I fell in love with it. The SYNC is just amazing and I love the traction control and 4 wheel disk brakes. The acceleration is smooth and the braking firm. The Fusion has the best handling I have ever driven in a sedan and it looks really sharp in the driveway. 5* crash ratings and a 10.0 from JD Power for reliability sealed the deal. No other brand has anywhere near the 'bang for the buck' that Ford does currently. As good as an import, has SYNC and costs thousands less. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have stayed away from Ford for a few years and have been driving a Mazda 3. Decided to go up a size and looked at the Mazda 6 first. However, I could not beat the price on the Fusion with all of the features. It was no contest. Once I test drove Fusion it sealed the deal. Definitely the best car I have driven in a long time. Hopefully others take note and give Fusion a chance before sticking with Honda or Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my wife an 09 V6 SEL. I bought it with 7,000 miles and it is CPO. I got the car cheaper than a new one with all the rebates and employee pricing, but more importantly, it is under warranty for 6/100 K. Because the vehicle has only been in use for 6 months and 7000 miles, that leaves us with 66 months and 93k miles on the warranty. The car is fun, looks great, and my wife really loves it. She had an 06 EB Expedition and did not think she would like the car, but her mind has changed very quickly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a Lincoln LS for a smaller car. This unit was a surprise. More rear leg room,about same size trunk, only deeper. I'm 6' and no problem at all. Ordered without sun roof and with the heated seats. The heating and air are simply fantastic. Quiet, comfy, great on gas, roomy and great on both highway and city driving. Would not hesitate to recommend</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a blue ink 09 v6 se in late Dec 08 with sync and I love the car, and sync. I have about 500 miles on the car and have no complaints at all. The car handles very well after two fill ups i am avg about 20 mpg in combined driving. If you are on the fence about getting SYNC get it. SYNC is amazing and hands free driving is nice as well as being able to use your ipod with the SYNC feature. Take a look at this car if in the market for a similar car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the 2009 Ford Fusion after testing the 2009 Camry, 2009 Altima, 2009 Sonata and 2009 Accord. The Fusion was more comfortable for me, rode smoother and handled the road better. I got the 4 cyl SE, automatic, with leather trim interior, sun roof and SYNC, spoiler and rear sensor. The Fusion performs above average and looks pretty good. I've enjoyed owing the car so far and have actually gotten several compliments on its appearance. Overall, very good job, Ford! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I went on our first road trip. I was surprised at how quiet, comfortable, and efficient the car was. I didn't get tired driving at all. We averaged 33mpg going 70mph on the freeway. The 4 cylinder isn't like a V6, but it is very adequate. When I had to pass it had no problem getting up to speed. The only thing is that I'm 6' and I have to lower the seat to have adequate head room. I love the sync.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is awesome. I got the AWD SE V6. It has plenty of power (honestly I don't even know why you'd need 270 or whatever the Honda offers) and I get decent gas mileage (23ish-24 mpg). I didn't get the Sport Appearance Package but it still looks good, and the ride is great. For the price (totaled around 20k), this is the best car out there.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Vapor Silver, leather, sport package, what a looker! Just awesome. I'm not crazy about the green dash lights, and the jury's still out on the Sync system. My ipod has 8k songs, and will that be read into the system OK? And so far I'm not as crazy about Sirius as I thought I would. Otherwise, I love this car. Easy on the gas I'm getting 22 MPG. It looks great just sitting in my garage!</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>I need my AWD!!!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I chose my 09 Fusion after looking at various Subarus and the Mecrury Milan. Yes the Milan is like the Fusion, but I liked the style of the Ford better. Subaru's total cost of insurance, fuel economy + power, options and price made me run away. I owned a Subaru, but the Fusions AWD is better, and the options were perfect for me. I drove an 08 Fusion last year in the West Virginia snow and it was awesome! Amazing ride and performance for the V6 with the AWD.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The V6 power, the confidence I have with the AWD system, gotta have my Microsoft SYNC for my bluetooth phone. I can fit 4 golf bags in the trunk with out folding down the seats! JD power and consumer reports gave this car great ratings and I will too! Great job Ford!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got a excellent deal on a great vehicle. Test drove many brands, but came back to the Fusion. This car rides beautifully and the interior with Black Leather is gorgeous. Thought about waiting until the 2010 model came out, but the deal was too good to pass. Car is still brand new so hopefully I'll feel good about my choice a year from now. The bonus is that CR rated 6 family sedans as reliable and 2 of them were the Fusion & Milan. Also, stated that Ford as a Brand was on par with the Japanese brands.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always enjoyed looking at the Fusion, mainly the SEL models. Now that Ford has slapped the sport appearance package on the SE its a sweet ride. I traded my 08 Tribute 2.3L for a 2.3L SE. What a difference with the same engine and a 5 speed auto makes. This car is so loaded and the rebates made it a no-brainer. I had X plan and a $3500 rebate. I bought a $23500 car for $17800. Vapor silver is so sleek looking with the 18" wheels. Mileage should be a better than 26mpg on my tribute. All my friends love the aggressive look. Honda, Toyota, Nissan and even the new Mazda6 just can't compare. Interested to see what the refreshened Fusion looks like, but the deals wont be as good!</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Back to Cars</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I was leasing a Dodge Dakota (14mpg). Made the decision to not get another pickup pretty easy. Had been watching the Ford Fusion for sometime. Reliability ratings are excellent, most reviews are above average, it's somewhat an American vehicle, I think. When Ford announced the rebates of $3000 on Sept. 10, it made the decision very easy. A brand new Ford Fusion SE with sunroof and sync for around $16000 is simply amazing. I paid $18000 for a new Mazda MX-6 in 1994 with less features than today, obviously. I have the 5-speed, I4. I have always loved 5-speed cars, and this one is no exception. Very forgiving clutch, and the power is not bad. Very fun to drive. 26mpg ave. 60-hwy/40-city</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>5 speed transmission makes the I4 fun to drive. The price with the current rebate is unbeatable. Of course the rebates are being offered because a facelift is coming for the 2010 model (due out early in 2009 it looks like). The SYNC gives you something to play with for the first few weeks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was and still am a little skeptical about buying a Ford but for the price you cannot beat its features. I got the Blue Suede Package and it's really sharp looking. I wish the car had a little more power but nothing an intake and exhaust cannot fix. Overall I love it so far. It's slick and the sports tuned suspension is slick when handling corners.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>18" rims and tires the Sync system should be standard on all cars now. The comfort of the seats. The sun roof is sweet as well as the sports tuned suspension.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I knew this was the car for me from the first time I sat in it..lol.. The test drive was my comfirmation. I got about 35 mpg on my trip and did have to refuel until I made it back home..awesome.. Driving this car is an experience.. just test drive one, you'll understand..oh yeah..I have the 5 speed manuel..so much fun to drive..</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really honestly cant decide on a favortie feature..I want to say the interior design with the bucket seats stitched and patterned in blue suede but the Sync system is so awesom. Then the way it looks from the side view when I clean my alloy wheels and put a little shine on the tires..Crazy Style!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking at the Altima because it was firmer than the base Fusion, but drove a "Sport Appearance Package" car with the tire and suspension upgrade. It has a much different feel. The manual transmission gives you control over the engine the automatic can't. It is a blast to drive and reminds me of a mid-80's Shelby Charger I used to have a long, long time ago, except this car has six airbags, room for 5, etc. Mileage is about 25 in mixed driving. My commutes to work and home are now much more fun.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely love my new car. The gas mileage is as good as most imports but yet you get the full size car. I have been averaging 28 city and 35 highway. Even with the 4 cyl I have plenty of power and acceleration. The only downside of this car is headroom. I have the sunroof and everybody in my family is over 6 feet tall and you have to have the seat adjusted down in order to not have your head touch the ceiling. I will never buy another car that does not have SYNC. That has to be the best thing ever put in a car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This purchase was a hard one for us. We have had 2 cars over the past 20 years and both were Camry's. Of course we first test drove an 09 Camry and when we walked away we were not impressed. We then drove a slew of other mid-size sedans and last on our list was the Ford Fusion, all I can say is that it really should have been first. If you are considering this car test drive it first, you will not be disappointed. We bought the SE with auto and 4cyl for the MPG. Very smooth ride and plenty of power. Add in the Sync and you have a perfect car.</TEXT>

The interior comforts are great and the exterior looks very nice. I linked by Blackberry to the SYNC and it works and sounds great. The car has good power, it is very comfortable, and other than the part about being significantly lower than the Excursion, I love this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Perhaps the greatest thing about this car is that it does it for you. The ergonomics are such that you think that they built the car around you! The seat adjustments were perfect for me and support of my back was spot on! I guess the most important thing that I can say about this car is that the handling is comparable to a race car! I have driven race cars and this car is on par! This car goes through the turns like it is on rails! The feel through the steering wheel is awesome! I have been buying Fords since 1967, and I know quality. If I were you, I'd buy a Ford!</TEXT>
