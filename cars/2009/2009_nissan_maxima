<TEXT>This is the worst car I have owned. I should have kept my previous car. This car is good to look at but nissan compromised on quality with this car. I have been having mechanical problems since purchasing this vehicle and no one can seem to fix the problem. There is a thumping noise coming from the wheel area. The interior is missing simple things like coin compartment and sun/eye glass holder. I am short and feel it lacks head room. the seats are horrible and the air conditioning/heated driver seat is a joke. I am ready to trade in this vehicle in. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Nissan and I must say that I'm in love. My previous two cars were a 2001 Mustang Bullitt and a 2003 VW Jetta GLI. I've been in many other cars and thus far the 2009 Maxima is my favorite. I actually look forward to running errands and driving to work! I bought the sports package and while some reviews say it's a harsh ride, I disagree. The ride is excellent, handling is as good if not better than my VW, and road noise is very minimal. The bluetooth works great with my iPhone 3GS, and while I haven't needed to use the GPS much what little I have used has been spot on. The acceleration is great for 290hp and a heavy car. I was told once to drive it like you stole it! :)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The electronics, handling, hp, comfort, and the body is gorgeous! Seamless iPhone integration! The people at Chevy Chase Nissan were outstanding which made the whole buying experience that much better. My wife loves the car and is just great all the way around!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I own a 1991 maxima which was the forefather of the 4dr sports car. I only have 35000 mile on it to date. I never thought there would ever be another maxima that would compare until now. Its not only better but it just blows everything away in its category. I may have had an old school vehicle but I forgot to mention I also own a 2008 acura mdx and a honda accord accord v6. Honda has its homework cut out for itself. Its value holding segment has finally met its maker and its time for the honda salesman just standing there saying over and over its a honda and it holds its value, poppycock! This maxima just does it all for a lot less then what it competes with. I don't need exotic badging....</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Black MAX</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have owned 5 Black Maximas. The last one was 2006. It was a great car but BORING. The 2009 is just flat fun to drive. It is loaded with all the toys; rides a little harder than the 2006 but it does give the sensation of a 4DSC. I just got back from the mountains and it handled like a dream. MPG was OK but the RUSH I got from pushing on the accelerator probably did not help. Looked at Infiniti G37, Lexus 250IS and 350 and Acura TL. Lexus had the best ride but with comparable features to the MAX it got very pricey. Infiniti did not have the room and Acura was Acura I'm just not quite that old yet. For the money the Max was the best value and gets MAXimum ratings on the driving FUNOMETER.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This Model has a very nice body style. Priced right and fun to drive. Until you make turns, when i make left or right turns into a small dip or driveway at speeds of no more then 2 mph. The struts make a ugly sound they don't take the impact at all. I went back to the dealer 3 times , a rep from Nissan took a look at it. For their fix they went to Home Depot brought a clear PVC tubing and weaved it through the struts to help with the bang. I still here the bang, and this is the best they can do after 35K.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got the car yesterday. I had a leased IS 250 to trade in and was looking to spend less but not downgrade too much. No buyers remorse here! (Except for my backup camera- that was nice.) I got the S model to save some cash and I don't miss the Lexus at all. The Maxima is a blast to drive and looks sleek- I got a compliment after owning it less than 24 hours. It has WAY more room than the IS but drives just as good. It has good pick-up on the highway and really turns heads. I test drove a loaded Camry SE and it just felt boring after owning the IS 250. The Maxima is a great car- I am very satisfied and can't wait to show it off. I got a great deal since it was an 09'. Go get one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Body style, VERY comfortable driver's seat- feels like a comfy recliner, light in the trunk which is something the IS doesn't have, 19 in. tires, charcoal interior has great detailed piano stitching, great handling on turns, lots of room in the back seat and trunk, plenty of leg room in the front</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Maxima</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Just acquired my 09 Maxima fully loaded with the panoramic sun roof. This car blows the mind. I sometimes have to keep my eye on the speedometer due to the CVT shift. It is very easy to go over speed limit when you don't feel the shift points. Voice control provides another way to manage some of the onboard functions such as navigation, phone and climate control. Bluetooth integration allows me to continue a conversation from my headset over my car's system with very no effort. If you should acquire one you may find yourself spending a few hours playing with all the technology. You will also drive this car just for the sake of driving it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, I traded my 06 Mustang GT. Anything within our budget, other than Maxima would have been a terrible disappointment. Plenty of room for three average sized adults (not happening in the Mustang). Great performance, super QUIET, great features, great exterior lines. My husband was really wanting Infiniti, but he wouldn't have it any other way now. Gas mileage is good compared to what I was getting on the Stang. This car is the best of both worlds between sports car and sedan. Great vehicle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I upgraded from my 96 Honda Accord 4 Dr LX to a 09 Nissan Maxima SV SP. Although I liked the new design of the Maxima, I was hesitant with the design of the rear but when I went to the dealership and saw this car in person it looks so much better, especially with the rear spoiler on it. I got the Sport Package that has the 19in alloy rims and spoiler upgrade and it's is so beautiful. I am one of the few, if not the only, person to have this car in my area so far, I see a lot of eyes and heads turning when I'm driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a white one, black interior, fully loaded SV Sport (corners like its on rails). The exhaust note. What you expect is NOT what you get. You get more. The 09 Maxima is a 4DSC. No doubt. The Maxima?s transmission takes some getting used to. Once hooked you begin to wonder why all cars are not build this way. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I have been waiting on this car for quite some time. we traded in our 05 Maxima for the 09 and don't regret a moment of it. The feel and style, the comfort, the technology, the thought that has gone into providing a true 4 door sports car is evident every time we get in to go somewhere. there are times we have to come up with excuse or reason just to go somewhere so that we can drive the car. My wife and I are Nissan fans anyway, we own a 05 Titan as well. Purchasing the new Maxima was a toss up between the G37S or the Audi A4.... obviously the Maxima won. This car is truly the Nissan flag ship and should be crowned as the 2009 car of the year. Hands down, great job Nissan!</TEXT>

<TEXT>First time owning a max and I absolutely love this car! This car is for the family guy that has a bit of an edge. it is not a hard core sports car but it can definitely compete. The acceleration is instant; With the CVT, the shifting is seamless and smooth. The interior is luxurious. I own an SV Premium/Tech with all the bells and whistles. I have 3 kids and they fit comfortable in the back seat. When I'm without the kids.. the family car goes away and the sports car comes out! This was by far the best car for me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the SV model with the technology and cold weather package. This car easily fits 3 car seats across the back seat which made this purchase even easier. The V6 290 horsepower engine is very powerful and the handling is unreal. I have been getting a lot of second looks driving this car around town, and have been stopped a couple of times at lights. This car has so many extras it is a great deal for the price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Technology package - love the bluetooth, navigation system and the iPod hookup. The leather seats are really nice and the interior feels like a sports car. I can not wait for winter to experience the heated seats and steering wheel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have not been a fan of Nissan cars before, but the '09 Maxima totally brought me into the Nissan fold. The exterior of this car is distinctive and beautiful. The interior of this car is well designed, very comfortable, and makes liberal use of high-quality materials. It's roomy and full of all kinds of toys! The engine is awesome, and the CVT is luxury smoothness! This car handles like a champ. If you are on the fence, test drive this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had an 05 Acura TSX I wanted to upgrade. Test drove the TL, TL-Type S, BMW 3 series, then this Maxima. The Maxima gives you all the gadgets and goodies of the BMW, the luxury of the TL, and on top of that a better MPG rating with the CVT.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 290 HP engine is a blast! The CVT took me a while to get used to, but now I can't imagine going back to a "normal" setup. It provides a smooth, shift free ride. The navigation is pretty easy and I like the built in hard drive for music storage. All around great car inside and out !</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After months of research and 3 weeks of test drives the purchase paid off. Before I bought my Silver on Black Max with premium package, I test drove the Acura TL, BMW 325i, Audi A4, Infinity G35, and a few others. The Maxima was not hands down the "better car" in each category, but lets look at what it gives you. It's not as fun as the BMW, not as quick as the G35 (I tested the rear wheel drive). It won't match the interior of the Audi.But, the Maxima comes fully loaded at around $37k. It comes with the technology - excellent navigation system, easy to use interface/layout, cooled/heated seats, gas saver CVT, 290 HP engine, nice leather, quite ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>As I explained above, this car is not perfect, but to me it's a perfect blend of luxury, sport, and technology, all at a price that cannot be ignored. For all the features this car has, I cannot complain about anything other than I wish it was free. I get compliments everywhere I go. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've always been a SUV guy, but with rising gas prices I started taking a look at a few of the larger sedans on the market. The 09' Maxima trumped all the other contenders... hands down. Fun to drive, decent gas mileage (about 20 mpg in the city so far), very comfortable, and it turns a lot of heads. I opted for the base package that includes a moonroof, power seats, 6 disc changer, 18 inch wheels, and cloth seats (although they are more like microfiber). Test drive this car, you will not be disappointed!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Mine is the SV model with sport package. It lives up to the hype and then some, it's a truly great 4 door sport car and it drives as well as an Infiniti. The acceleration from the 290 HP version of the award-winning VQ V6 engine is great. In most situations the car handles like it's on rails. It's just fun to drive, you'll make excuses to go somewhere because you want to drive this car. The styling is well done too, it just looks great. Especially in black. Lexus and Acura can't touch this for the combination of performance, features, and price. This is a bargain for all the car you're getting compared to an Acura TL S Type or a loaded Lexus IS 350.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>So many of them, performance, fun to drive, Bose stereo and incredibly comfortable leather seats inside. The layout of the instruments and placement of everything inside for the driver is very well designed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I just purchased the 3.5 SV premium fully loaded. The looks of this car are great inside and out. The engine and transmission are second to none for its class and there are enough gadgets on the car to make any ?gadget freak? blush. There are 2 modes for driving: an automatic mode or an ?aggressive? manual mode which we found impressive. We test drove the Infinity M35 AWD prior to our purchase and the Maxima gave it a run for its money; in some instances beating it. The car is roomy and comfortable, however if you?re a person over 6? tall, I recommend not sitting in the back seat with the front seats all the way back. I would be surprised if this car didn?t win best car of '09.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This thing turns on a dime?and has great acceleration. The navigation control center and Bose system is awesome. The double moon roof and the driver side air conditioned seats are my personal favorites.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The newest of the Maximas, the 09 is breathtaking. The aggressive look and lines of a Maserati, an the interior of a $60k Benz of BMW. HP has been upped almost 40 more and the newest version of the cvt is smoother then our old Murano. Looks like nothing else on the market and draws attention everywhere! Great value for the money, even the standard model comes with push start ignition and sunroof. I love mine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Luckily I happen to be the owner of the Arizona's first 2009 Nissan Maxima :) I have had it only couple of days, but gentlemen, this car is a treat. The ride is so much better than any earlier Maxima. Especially at turns, this cars gives a damn good feel. With 290HP, this cars is giving me 21MPG in city so far, which is only 2 days. Interior is much richer and I would rate it as better than Infinity G35. 3.5S comes standard with 8-way power seats (with manual lumber support), moon roof and 8 speaker audio system, steering wheel mounted audio controls, all of which are upgrades in other cars like Altima or Accord. Will come back with more reviews after I get to drive it for couple of weeks</TEXT>

<TEXT>While waiting for the Maxima's release, drove most all 6 cylinders, including G35, Acura TL, Toyota Avalon, Accord, etc. True sports car enthusiasts may not care for the front wheel drive, but the Maxima handles very well for an entry level luxury sedan with a sporty feel. Performs better and the convenience items are great. Got the SV w/Premium Package -- white w/tan interior. Looks great. Will be back to comment on fuel economy. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dual sun roof, iPod interface with the monitor, back-up camera, sleek body lines. 290 horses accelerate very smoothly with the CVT. Premium package has very nice leather interior. Surprising room for this 6'1" driver.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just picked up my Black on Black Maxima 3.5 SV. Got it with the sport package. A great car in and out ! The redesigned interior screams luxury, while the carbon trim and sport paddle shifters give it a sport look/feel. This car has all the toys! Bluetooth, navigation, heated seats, premium leather, etc. The CVT is smooth and the driving is great. The car is very spacious, even in the back. For the price, it beats the Acura TL easily and gives you a lot more features than you can get in any German import. Car of the year!</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a fun car to drive. We went thru a lengthy process to pick out a sedan that met mileage, comfort and appearance conditions we deemed important. The Maxima won out no hands down. Mileage is good for a luxury car, about 25 so far with mixed driving, and comfort is superb. We bought the SV model fully loaded and can't be happier. We strongly recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Maxima, I love it! Its fast, fun, and sexy, its got hips. The Premium pack and I love the double sunroof, just wish the rear one opened. There is an endless power feeling with the CVT trans. With front wheel drive it doesn't feels so much like a sports car, but it handles at a top notch level. On and off ramps can be a lot of fun. If you want the balls to the wall sports car, drop the kids off at grandmas, and buy the 370Z. MPH is not the greatest, but its a big V6. All in all, I'll buy another one when it comes time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Leased mine in May. After doing extensive research I came to the conclusion that this was the best value for what I wanted: unique body style, performance, luxury, amenities, and decent gas mileage. I have not been disappointed. I love getting into this car every morning and evening. The car is incredibly smooth. Someone once wrote that it drives like a "heavy" car. I know what was meant. It feels solid and heavy. If you ever drove, say a bmw 7 series, when you take your foot off the gas, it seems to coast forever. As this does. My wife loved it so much she got her own about one month after me. So now I have my black and her white max. in the garage. It is a good looking garage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My 3rd maxima, and by far the best. I am glad maxima is back with much more personality than last two generations. This car is almost a infiniti. I red most of the reviews here and I see some owners rated the fuel economy at 5 to 8. NONSENSE. I rated at 10 because this is a powerful V6 engine car and for what it does gas mileage is fantastic. If you want to complain and cry about gas mileage, please do not buy this car, go buy a boring hybrid and yawn while you drive around. I love everything about this car. Its hot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned a Premium+Tech Maxima for nearly 1 year now with 0 defects and 22 MPG avg. The ride and drive is a perfect blend of luxury and Performance - 0 to 60 mph in 6.3 secs, yet a nice comfortable ride on the highway. Very little road noise at highway speeds. I came very close to buying a Lexus GS350 but found the performance + cost superior in the Maxima. Same story with M35. I already owned a TL, so I didn't want to do that again;-) The Maxima also does a great job at the little stuff like a strong A/C system, large glove box, great iPOD integration, large map and cup holders, and easy to read owners manual. Finally, the bold exterior lines on this car are amazing!! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Premium Package is worth the extra money - dual sunroofs, air conditioned seat, rear seat controls, sunshade, etc.. I originally thought my Acura TL/ELS radio was better than the Maxima's Bose. Over the last 1 year, I now believe the Bose is BETTER than the ELS sound system! Love the 9Gb harddrive</FAVORITE>

After driving other nissans like, 350Z, murano and altima coupe now I'm back to maxima again and could not be happier.

<TEXT>In a nutshell - if you're even looking at this car, you're probably looking for the same thing I was. I loved the look of the 2007 Infinity G35 coupe and swore I'd do anything to get it after test driving it. Aside from the compact factor, everything else I liked was tech related or cosmetic. I didn't get it b/c it was way over my budget at the time and once the new Maxima came out, it was literally love at first sight. My Maxine (you heard right) has Premium + Technology packages, ultimately containing everything that the G37 Coupe currently has in its interior aside from the 2-hand Infinity clock. Many reviews I read call the Maxima more of an Infinity than an Infinity itself. CAR IS FUN!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Shape & new bold / risky design. I love it! Premium Bose sound system gives it a luxury feel. Excellent Technology Package, including birds-eye view GPS, fully integrated control system, voice control, etc. On my particular car, my favorite is the colors. Super Black with Tan Leather interior. HOT!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall the Maxima is a good car. I came out of a BMW 550 so it was a little getting use too. The payment doesn't hurt as much! The CVT is strange in the beginning but is unnoticeable now. The car is deceiving, with the CVT you get the feeling that you are not going as fast as you actually are. Very roomy. Decent highway fuel mileage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The wife and I were looking for a car to replace a VW Passat. We needed something that we both were comfortable driving.... I needed more headroom and wanted sporty performance, she wanted a four door that performed plus wasn't too big in parking lots. We tried the new VW CC and Passat, but the Maxima had more for the money. As a retired state trooper I'm used to handling cars. I tried abrupt 180 degree steering wheel inputs on the Maxima and it handled them perfectly. I don't plan on taking the Maxima out on a race track, but it's nice to know that it can handle crash avoidance maneuvers on the highway. This car is fun to drive and safer than the average sports car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got back from a two week, 2500 mile vacation in my Maxima. What an absolute pleasure this car is. Loaded with all the "bells & whistles" and then some, she performed every task I threw at her. From Interstate driving to finding my way through small towns, the GPS was invaluable, the dual climate control very much appreciated, and the entertainment system was incredible. The power driver's seat allowed me to change up positions to help with driver fatigue, and the 300 hp engine provided all the power we needed for passing and high speed Interstate driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I think my favorite feature of my Max has to be the Xenon headlights. I am diabetic, and my nightsight isn't what it used to be, and these Xenon low beams were fantastic. I just wish the high beams were also Xenon.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is awesome. I have had this car for exactly one day. I don't need more to write this review. I know something about cars; have owned and driven mercedes, audi, bmw, infinity, and most of the rest. They do not touch this car. It is beautiful, inside and out (subjective of course). Feels like a tank but drives like (or better than) the 330 I traded up from for about 1/2 the price. All the bells and whistles. Looks and feels great. I don't even care if gas mileage is not great. Please don't buy this car. I want exclusivity on the roads.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 04 Maxima SL for an premium SV with Tech. The only two things I hated about my 04 was the turning radius and heated seats. The 09 has been greatly improved. I compared this vehicle to a VW CC and Acura TL. The features, looks, and price blew the other two away. Fantastic interior and a quiet ride. The voice activation works great. I never have to repeat myself. Took a while to figure out that I can't hop on the gas and expect to get great gas mileage. Average 22 around the city. Haven't taken it on a long trip yet, but hopeful it will meet the 26 mpg it boasts for highway mileage. I had no problems with my 04 after 115000 miles and I am hoping for the same with this </TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a loaded 2003 Maxima SE and liked the car very much. When it hit 100k, I decided it was time to replace it (that is normally my practice). I drove the Hyundai Genesis, but found it more of a luxury car, rather than sport sedan. I also drove the Infiniti G35 and loved the way it drove but found the back seat a little smallish compared to the Maxima and had trouble getting past the $35k price ($40k sticker). The new Maxima rides and drives very nicely, but front wheel drive definitely removes it from a true sports car driving experience. I am also very disappointed that the SV does not include satelite radio in the Bose system.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a new 09 Maxima after much research and lots of time looking and driving a few other cars. When I first decided to buy a new car, my wife recommended a MAX because she has an 08 - Well, they are COMPLETELY different. This car feels roomier inside and even drives bigger. The exteriors also look separate. Overall - if you want a car in this price range just go DRIVE a MAX and you'll end up taking one home. The tech features as well make it a hard car to pass by. Overall it's an awesome car and I wouldn't want any other vehicle in it's class...possibly even in a few classes above it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been leasing new Maximas every 3 years since 1996 (except for 2006 when I opted for the V6 Altima) and the 2009 SV is the best one yet. For the money, it is the best FWD sports sedan available. It is extremely powerful, the CVT is very smooth (although opting to drive in the "S" or "Manual" modes allows you to feel as though the engine is shifting gears), and provides a nice balance between sporty handling and comfort. Based on Edmunds' review (which I am in complete agreement with), I did not get the Sport package and am perfectly happy without it. I have been disappointed with Nissan's treatment of the Maxima these past few years, but am thrilled that for 2009 they nailed it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was leaving my 2007 9-3 Saab, looking for something with more rear room, bigger trunk and a little more tech features. Looked at the Infiniti G37xS sedan, which was everything I wanted, except that I really wasn't in love with its exterior looks, and the rear seat was not that much roomier than my Saab. I also looked at the Hyundai Genesis, which was very interesting, but I just wasn't a fan of the center console, the pricing I was getting and the fact that I would be telling people I had a Hyundai for $500 a month. Maxima ended up being the best balance, although I would have preferred the 7sp and extra horsepower of the G37</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dual sunroof, this is not surprisingly on of my favorite features. I have 2 young kids who sit in the backseat, and the glass room really brightens up the interior.

<TEXT>Actually a great car, EXCEPT it just quit in the middle of a parkway, battery light came on and car stopped. Towed to dealer, can't find anything,replaced battery. Two days later car quits again, this time a referburshed alternator put on, (note 8K miles on a 2009), also replaced wiring harness for alternator with after market, not listed on repair order because they purchased seperately, to wait for a new one from Nissan would take 3 days, THEY didn't want to wait, not me! Now I'm driving a car with 8K and a used alternator and who knows wiring harness, Still no answer on why the alternator went out and the harness burned!!I should have my head examined!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The time had come to part with my 2006 Mustang GT because I needed a four season driver. I looked at Altima, Malibu, Fusion, Passat and Accord. They were all great automoblies, but none of them were distinctive enough to lure me into making the move. My wife suggested I look at the Maxima. I did not think I could afford the car, but the trade/purchase numbers allowed me to get into the 3.5S and I am quite impressed with this automobile. The build quality is top notch. The engine/CVT transmission combination is smooth and powerful. I have read some negative reviews of the body style and I am surprised. The body style of this vehicle is one of the main reasons I purchased it. So far, a winner!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a vehicle on par with any Lexus, Infinity, BMW, or Mercedes. The price makes it a better option than any of the latter. It is extremely impressive from both a technology and performance perspective.I purchased an SV with the technology package and I now have a vehicle with better integrated technology than cars which cost up to $20,000 more. Why lease for prestige when you can own the real thing. This car could be the next Nissan classic along with the Z cars. Test drive one and you will get rid of your current so called "Luxury" car. Smooth acceleration, which blows the doors off of sports cars, while riding in the lap of luxury and technology is a winning combination. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I enjoy the ease of use for all technology systems. The I-Pod integration is beyond belief. The responsive VQ 3.5 V-6 at 290hp combined with CVT is light years beyond the competition. The bluetooth navigation and phone integration is an outstanding enhancement. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just picked up our new Maxima 3.5 SV. Looks gorgeous and rides pretty well. We arrived home and noticed the passenger side window malfunctioning (unusual rattling noise). We opted for the tech package also, and that should have included a compact flsh drive. The cover to the flash drive is jammed solid and won't come. We have to drive 150 miles again and take it to the dealership to have it fixed. Will not pay that kind of money for such sloppy workmanship and less than optimum dealership that does not check the car put prior to selling. Who knows what other surprises are awaiting.</TEXT>

This car is really fun to drive I recommend it to anyone who wants great Tech, comfort and a fun sporty drive! Heated steering wheel sealed the deal I would have bought another Infiniti but none of them had a heated wheel! And I saved a lot of money in the process!

<TEXT>I seriously considered (and test-drove) the Toyota Avalon, the Lexus ES330/350 and IS250, and the Maxima was just a better overall vehicle. It's comfortable, stylish, feature-rich, and extremely fun to drive. The CVT transmission is very responsive, the engine has ample power, handles like a sports car, yet has room for 4 people (it has seat belts for 5, but the 5th one had better be a midget). I fell in love with the iPod integration immediately, and the center console computer (I didn't buy the nav) has bucketloads of information if you desire info. I can't say enough about how I enjoy the SmartKey (breaking the habit of taking out a key was easier than I thought). Terrific vehicle! </TEXT>

<TEXT>The New Maxima is performing as well as any vehicle at this point. The biggest flaw at this time is the MPGs. After taking the car on a several hundred mile trip, the mpg only reached 21.6( highway) This was at an average speed of about 70 mph and very little use of the brake. The sticker touts a 26 mpg rating.(highway) 21.6 represents about 17% less then promised return. OK we are in a recession and everybody is lying about something but I leased this vehicle for the fuel aspect and commuting purposes. I guess even Nissan is involved in their own type of fraud, that being posting unobtainable gas mileage. It still beats the hell out of the 12 mpg I was getting with the Jeep Commander.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have own 3 Maximas' before this one and liked each one of them. The type of car that I was looking for had to have the following requirements. Manageable price and monthly payments, Very good power, room (I'm well over 6'0" tall) quality, and have good gas mileage. I looked at Lexus', Infiniti's M45 & M35. I tried to own another sedan besides the Max for a change of pace, but the Maxima meet those requirements the best. This is by far the best Max that I've ever driven! My model is an SV and it's very fun to drive. It looks sharp and aggressive. The acceleration is exhilarating, and whenever I turn off the VDC button, it gives it even a bigger boost. The cockpit design is excellent.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite audio feature is their Ipod setup. The Ipod station is invisible to the passengers because the hookup is inside the arm rest.

I have 17800 miles due to trips from Jacksonville, FL to Delaware and Louisiana. I have made numerous trips to Orlando and Miami as well. Great car, fun to drives and it never gets old. With regular maintenance every 3750 miles, it stills drives new with no problems. It is a huge improvement over the previous Maxima. Yes, I had a 2006 Maxima. It was nice, but too soft and didn't handle nearly as nice. The new Maxima is stiffer, shorter and wider making it the best handling FWD vehicle I have ever driven. I've driven 99.9% of FWD vehicles in North America.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Sport package sports a 27% stiffer suspension than my 2006 Maxima. Also the Ds mode is highly addictive and hard to beat in manual mode.

<TEXT>I have already traded the car in for an Infiniti M45X. The car is a head turner. It really is a good looking car. The fuel economy was great for a V-6. This car has all the toys you want, rear view camera, iPod, and something really cool was the compact flash drive. 8.3G hard drive. You can play music for hours. Now for the bad part. The passenger side seat shook when I got over about 50 mph. Got the tires balanced at my expense and then took it to the dealership as the problem persists and they told me that is just the way they are. The car drives decently on a good road but on a rough road this car shakes badly. For $32k I was expecting more, so now I drive an 2008 Infiniti M45X.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've driven Avalons in past, and an XKR convertible, time for a change. My Maxima has every option but spoiler and Music Box. I've driven 500m, what an exhilarating experience! I haven't ramped them up side by side yet but I believe the Maxima in sport shift is nearly if not as fast 0-60 as the Jag with similar agility in the corners. It would take a lot of practice to beat sport shift mode using the manual mode paddles. Don't like feel of the road, instantaneous, exacting, spirited and nimble response to commands (equal or better than the XKR) forget it. Pedal to the metal passing a semi dogging it, over the distance of the rig, WOW! speedometer north of 100 MPH pulling back in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I downsized from a 2005 BMW 545i, and I drove almost everything trying to emulate that ?ultimate? ride. Well, good luck. This is a nicely equipped sedan, I got the S version with cloth seats. These can get pricey when you move up to an SV with various option packages. If you are used to a rear wheel drive sports sedan, you may not like the front wheel drive. I am having difficulty getting used to the handling drop off. I also drove the 300C and G8 GT, get those if you want rear wheel drive at a similar price point. I may trade it in early. Sigh.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my jet black Maxima Sport Edition on Xmas Eve 2008. I had narrowed it down to the Maxima, an Acura TL, or a BMW 128. The Maxima proved to be the best value, while probably not the top quality, but there is a lot to be said for value. If you're into Technology Packages, the Acura is the way to go as the Maxima Voice Recognition is nearly useless. It will turn things on and off, but not make adjustments, such as temperature control. The Acura excels here. But it's about the ride and comfort! And the Maxima offeres gobs of both, along with exhilarating performance and great gas mileage (23 in town, 28+ on the road) The CVT is admirable and fun. And the Max has looks to die for</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Driveability, performance, looks, comfort, gas mileage, looks, GPS, sound system, did I say looks??? This car is a great value... lots of bang for the buck. I get compliments all the time! Paddle shifters work great with the CVT.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 1750 miles,this car rocks, and it is understated to none. I did not opt for the nav or Premium Pkg. as these items are easily added OEM portables. I don't need heated seats, the cockpit is extremely well-configured, I am 6'2 lots of room, tested Acura TL, the same class Lexus, BMW and VW. MPG on the 315HP with K&N filter is a rocketship, a loyalist is formed; price is a value after you drive this sexy rocket, and compare. With the look of a thoroughbred, it just calls to be driven, I cannot stop staring at it, but I have taken up residence again in the house, it was difficult to leave alone and it calls now... bye</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have now owned the car almost two months and am very pleased. I have the premium package with the nav. You are getting plenty for your money and everything has been great. I am averaging 23/27 for hwy/city and I am using premium fuel. The pickup the car has is excellent, nav is great, Bose stereo is great and climate control is great. Heated seats and steering wheel is a plus. The ride and handling are fine and steering is fine. Don't be alarmed the brakes feel a little soft but they are fine. The trunk needs a little push to close but a minor issue. I recommend the car highly to anyone!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I think I know what I am talking about, because I have driven Lexus ES, Infiniti GS, Acura TL and Maxima 06. Mind you I drove them because I or my family member owns these cars. My review is not based on test drives. I think the editor is incorrect in saying - if you can live without ohs and ahs of neighbors then Maxima is for you. Not that it matters, but for the last two weeks that I have had this car that is all am getting from friends, colleagues and neighbors. This feeling is same across both genders. I would buy this any day over Acura, Lexus or Audi A6. Cons: wish it was quieter inside like Lexus and that Nissan can make this beast a rear-wheel drive. Great size for family too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased black on black SV with premium package about a week ago. First Nissan ever owned. Have been putting through paces in urban and highway traffic. Thus far, a VERY solid buy for those wanting quick response in a 4 door sedan. The premium package has enough "toys" to satisfy most hi- to moderately "techie" drivers. Head turning quotient is very high, which is good or bad depending on how many speedtraps you have in your travels *lol* CVT is a dream so far.</TEXT>

I'm averaging a shocking 27.3 on the hwy using the recommended 93 octane. The engine is tuned for nothing less than 93 octane fuel. I love the handling, the fit & finish are excellent.

<TEXT>Traded 05 Maxima SE for 09 with Sport pkg. Difference is night and day. 09 is a dream come true. Great handling, interior, design and gas mileage to boot. If they made this in a convertible, might consider trading in 02 Vet roadster. Hardest decision was which package to purchase. Utilized on extended trip, shortly after purchase. At highway traffic speeds, gas mileage was unbelievable, great on the open road and got lots of rave comments on design throughout the southwest US. Since return, seen avg gas mileage of 25, in town. Handled well in first snow of season. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling and mileage. Shortly after purchase, took 42K mile trip. avg. 30+ thru various terrains. Somewhere in Utah, an 09 Vet owner is wondering why he couldn't get around this vehicle thru the esses. Lots of positive comments on design and interior</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We test drove Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, VW Passat and Audi A4 and we were blown away with the new Nissan Maxima. The looks inside and out, feel and performance all stand out above the others we drove. This car handles so tight and has so much power that you feel constrained to drive the speed limit. The only negative is the recommended premium fuel and the gas mileage. The dealer really downplays the premium fuel, in fact we had to ask about it. We are getting right on the EPA fuel rating of 26-27 highway using regular. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my white Maxima with premium and technology packages for 3 months and 5000 miles. I absolutely love the car. My budget was anything less than around $55k when I was looking which included the Lexus GS350, ES 350, Acura TL and RL. I needed a larger car and wanted something fully loaded out so I didn't bother looking at BMW or Mercedes. The car is very, very comparable to my business partner's Audi A6 4.2, right down to the rear window shade and rear view camera that shows intended travel path. The quality of the materials is very comparable and all for $30k less. This car gets many looks and looks great with the dual sunroof. Highly recommended.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quality of materials,rear shade to keep sun off the kiddos, rear view camera that shows where your wheels will end up, voice activated nav (I never use the nav in my wife's Tahoe because it is manual entry, now I use it all the time), stereo system and the seamless iPod interface. The car rocks! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My husband owned a BMW 740i and I had a BMW x5 coming off lease. We have been a BMW family for a long time and had been considering a BMW 3 or 5. My husband saw a Maxima in person, and was impressed with the styling, so we went for a test drive. I never expected to get him into this car. We were so impressed with all the features we got in the car (Sport loaded) that a similarly equipped 3 would have been $55k, and we loved the sporty look and feel of the dash board and small steering wheel! We had fun driving it, and were impressed with the 5 star crash ratings. In todays economy, why spend more money for a name, when if you don't look at the emblem, you don't know this is a Nissan.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We loved the styling. Ours is black and with all the chrome, it looks as rich and classy as a BMW or Lexus. The dash is Young looking, not stuffy, and it has a great nav system, fantastic Music Box Bose radio, and features like heated seats, memory positioning, which make you feel quite pampered.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Let me first start by saying that this is one of the most fun cars I have had the pleasure of driving. It sucks down the recommended 93 octane like it is a sports car with a big engine. Oh wait, it is a sports car (4-doors) with a good sized engine. The ride is a little stiff but it is supposed to be like that. There are more bells and whistles that I can shake a stick at. If you want luxury, you will get most of the high end items that you would get from the others. If you like to drive, this is a great car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Push your foot into the pedal and it will let you know there is power there. The 18s and the suspension pull you through corner without effort.

Even after 2 weeks I still find myself staring at it after I get out. Was worried a bit about gas mileage before buying but I've put 1000 mixed miles on it and am getting about 24 mpg. Using regular grade gas as well even though premium is recommended. Traded in an Infiniti I30 which I loved, but the new Maxima has it beat. Love the car so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I just picked-up our Winter Frost, Maxima SV, w/Sport pkg. It's the first Nissan we've owned, and we couldn't be more pleased. I would HIGHLY recommend the Sport pkg. as it adds eye-popping 19in. rims, a spoiler, and fog lights, among several other amenities. It seems trivial, but I'd also recommend mud flaps as they add an extra piece of trim just behind the front & rear tires. (These aren't you dad's Pontiac Camero mud flaps.) Nissan engineers pulled-out the stops from the remarkably smooth CVT to the telescopic steering wheel and well-appointed leather interior. The driving experience feels like you're in an F-14 cockpit and the exterior has the lines of a GS 400.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2009 Maxima 3.5 SV with Premium and Technology package in Silver Color replaces my 2004 Maxima. Nissan has done many things right with this car. You need to drive the new Maxima to appreciate the "Four Door Sports Sedan" motto. From outside, it has very unique and appealing design (pictures do not tell the story - you need to see it). Inside is full of technology which is very well integrated with the needs of the driver. The ride comfort and power is amazingly well blended in the premium package. Nissan raised the bar so high with this model that now they need to compete with a different class of cars. I strongly recommend this generation of Maxima. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent handling for a 290 HP front- wheel car. Maxima has the best CVT implemented in the market. Inside, the Bose stereo provides an amazing sound to multiple music sources. Excellent iPod integration. High quality materials inside and out, including comfortable leather seats. Very quiet ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the Nissan Maxima because I had thought that Nissan had a great name. The car had a stunning interior and great overall design, but I'm barely getting 20 mpg for normal half freeway half highway driving. Also the brakes are always making noise and every time I take the car in they charge me $200 to change the brakes on a brand new car. This car is smaller than camry/altima and I will never buy a Nissan again. DO your research before you buy this car, A lot of people will tell you it's not worth the price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>From an over priced E350 to my dream car. Once I got over my love affair with the tri-star emblem and really started looking for value, the choice was clear. From the first picture in a magazine to the brochure in the mail to the test drive, I knew I had to have this car. Couldn't choose between silver or precision gray, flipped a coin and walked away with a precision gray beauty with a spoiler that says bye to cars behind me.

<TEXT>Bought the SV with sports package. Really like the looks of the car and the engine/ transmission combination is sweet. Mileage is also quite good for a car of this type. My main complaint is that the ride comfort with the sport suspension and the low profile tires is extremely harsh and jittery on any road that is not reasonably smooth. And in my city in Ohio, smooth roads are in short supply. I know it is a sports sedan, but the engineers should have been able to design a more supple ride. In addition, I need to get the front fender repainted due to a dark area on the top. It is covered under warranty but is a real bummer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>As an owner of a 1998 Nissan Maxima, I eagerly awaited the release of the re-designed 2009 Maxima. I purchased the SV with Premium & Technology packages. The car handles very well and rides comfortably in spite of the 18" tires. The interior is inviting but has a mix of quality and inferior looking items. The plastic wood trim is somewhat of an eyesore and seems to detract from the numerous plush features. However, all of the other interior details make up for this shortcoming. The engine is very responsive and the CVT is seamless. You can't even feel the car shift!</TEXT>

Handling is unreal and the acceleration is exhilarating. The technology package is a must and the XM traffic/nav system is so cool, all my friends can't believe what it can do. The lines are beautiful and are better (IMO) than the BMW (5), Audi, Acura TL/RL, and Lexus IS/GS. Wait until you see one in person - the pics don't do it justice. The car is gorgeous!!!</TEXT>
