<TEXT>Purchased the SLT Z71 with 5.3L, which replaced a 2007 SLE. Although not estatic with the last truck, I couldn't pass up the repeat-buyer rebates on the '09. The SLT interior is very comfortable and pleasing to the eyes, and it's worth the upgrade from the SLE. The BOSE sound system is very good. Truck rides and handles nicely. My only complaints are a constant squeaking in the driver side door panel area (which the dealer is trying to fix), 18" tires that collect and throw rocks causing the exterior paint to chip, and the soft paint. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>BOSE sound system, center console, Auto 4WD, reverse sense and camera.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I started shopping for a new truck I made a concerted effort to be objective. I drove them all. The trucks I test drove (in this order) were the Ford F-150, Nissan Titan, Dodge Ram, Chevy Silverado, Toyota Tundra, and GMC Sierra. I returned to test drive the the Ford and the Dodge. When it was all said and done; the GMC is the truck that stood out above all others. A combination of its appearance, comfort, features, and just the way the truck felt and drove simply overshadowed the other trucks. This truck has plenty of power, great ergonomics, and I like the features. The 6sp Auto and 5.3L are a pleasure to drive and run as smooth and quiet as I expect a truck to be. Solid Truck!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6sp Auto with tow/haul and manual select, electronic shift 4x4, active fuel management, handling, Stering wheel controls, Bluetooth, Power pedals, Power heated/folding/auto dimming (driver side) side view mirros, reverse sensors, storage compartments, transmission temp guage, ONSTAR and XM, comfort.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have 1400 miles on my new truck. Love it. The 5.3 w/6A is a super combo. Using the electo/manual shift button, you can chirp the (18" chrome clad) tires in 2nd gear (it hits quick!). Just traded a 2008 GMC 5.3 w/4A. 3 reasons why I traded/upgraded so quick: 1) Cloth seats collected lint, 2) Slow (20" wls) 3)Fantastic trade-in value on the 08. I have no trouble getting 20mpg highway at 75mph. If you drive it like you stole it, you can't get much worse than 15! Easily 10% better than my 08. The leather seats are great for long trips. Deep floor mats, nice touch. Added Retrax bed cover, black nerf bars & black wheel well liners for the rear wheels. Looks good with white paint.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The remote start is cool and practical. The 6 speed is why I traded. The Bluetooth connection is an excellent addition. The BOSE w/ subwoofer is awesome, although the standard radio is fine. I like the 18" wheels better. I would prefer 20"s, just not the style nor penalty on speed and mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded a 1997 Sierra with 215,000 miles for an 2009 Sierra 4WD Z-71 crew cab after a search of every make out there. I should have went straight to the GMC dealer as I have not been disappointed. This truck rides/handles like a car, gets great mileage (avg 17.1 in mixed driving) and is loaded for comfort. I have had two issues addressed by dealer, rubbing noise on drivers door and rattle in drivers seat belt system. Both fixed on first visit. This is not the least expensive truck out there, but the looks, fit, finish and quality makes it a winner.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The creature comforts in the cab combine with the interior/exterior looks to make the truck pleasing to be in and around. From top to bottom, GM did the Sierra redesign right. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Get the 5.3L with the six-speed automatic. Averaging 20 MPG over first 2,000 miles 85%/15% Hwy/City driving. 20 inch wheels (rims are ugly) make for very smooth ride. Engine is very quiet with good power and shifts are very smooth. Quiet interior is a plus, and the leather seats are comfortable. Plenty of power to pass without sacrificing economy. Use the manual shift overrride function to control downhill speeds. Wife likes the 6-way seats and adjustable pedals with the memory function for seat/mirrors.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auto 4WD meshed with the 6-speed auto is perfect in rain/snow. Bose stereo is solid and speed-sensitive volume control eliminates need to adjust radio as you speed up/slow down. Tube running boards make easy entry/exit. Back up sensors and windshield wiper sensors ++. Flip up rear seats ++.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great truck to drive, handles soooooo good. The 20in wheels is a great option to have. the 5.3l v8 is so smooth. I looked at Ford, Toyota, Dodge and I kept going back to Gmc, I feel like I made a great choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First new pickup in many years, always had a used one around, but primary vehicle has been SUV's until now. This truck has the Z71 off road pkg and the towing pkg that includes the 5.3L/6A upgrade. Overall, the ride is good but the seats are not very comfortable for long rides. Iyt seems to have good power even towing a heavy load. Fuel economy could be better, but I only have 4500 miles on it so that might improve some. I average 15 mpg with 17 being my best highway trip so far. On the down side, it has a light rattle in the A/C vent that I cant pinpoint, but varies with fan speed and the rock chip protectors on the fenders are peeling off. But overall, it seems to be a good vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stereo, instrument cluster, backup warning and overall exterior design.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had the truck just over a month and have 400 miles on it. It has the All-Terrain Pkg and the 5.3L engine. It is sooo much fun to drive. I love the Stealth Gray color. Gray when the sun goes down very metallic when the sun comes up. It has a great ride and a lot of toys to play with. Only one problem so far. I have the 18" chrome wheels. The spare is a 17". Oh well somebody goofed. Will have to get it changed out in the near future.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the color, style and ride! The Onstar is fun and can get a diagonistics report every month!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I sent three months looking at the various options. I came close to purchasing the Toyota Tundra. The 2009 GMC Sierra is golden. I have forgotten to turn it off when stopped at times becuase the engine is so quite. It rides like a luxury SUV. Functionality and features are great. Would like to have had the ITBC since it has the towing package. It handles a little bit looser than the Toyota but the power is the same or better. I went on some WV mountains on Route 50 and it pulled up just fine. It wanted to go a little too fast down the mountain so I downshifted instead of overusing my breaks which worked fine. I haven't towed my 8K trailer yet which should be the test.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the Onstar and XM radio with controls on the steering wheel. I haven't setup my Bluetooth yet but know that will be a plus. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Get the 5.3L for sure! The six speed is great for 2009. However, adding a cold intake really helped with gear hunting at higher speeds,alltitude and hills. No problems except I had a creaking noise from the undeside since new. Turns out I needed a whole new drive shaft. Have over 8K on it now and dont regret a thing. More room than Japanese trucks espcially in head room department. Never feels underpowered. I did add ICON DYNAMICS coil overs/rear shocks and they make it handle amazingly with no ride loss. Get them, you wont regret it. They leveled out the front too!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>engine, simplicity, looks, comfort, lots of aftermarket parts/accessories, getting employee pricing and $3K cash to get out of my Saab lease early...DONE DEAL!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought this truck (slt, z71, 1500 crew cab) last week. The aesthetics are very nice in and out. Not quite as comfortable as my old truck, but I assume that will take some breaking in. It has lots of little extras (back up warning lights in the rear of the cab) which I am still finding out about. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the truck and highly recommend it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a SLT Crew cab 4wd with the all-terrain package. The finish on the truck is awesome, and the chrome with the silver birch color great. I've gotten many compliments. I've been impressed with the mpg of around 20.5, and this truck handles great. My only issue is that my starter went bad @1000 miles. I found myself stranded on my way to the beach. GMC did take care of me and fixed my truck, but I'm disappointed to have mechanical difficulties so soon. There are also not many parts available yet for this model. I hope this proves to be a dependable truck in the long run.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just returned from a 3000 mi trip with my new gmc. Great truck on the hi way with the 5.3 flex fuel engine and active fuel management. I could not tell when it shifted from 4 to 8 cylinders or back again, Plenty of passing power and plenty of storage room inside for luggage etc. On Star and Xm radio are amazing!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>On Star, Xm radio, Interior comfort on a long trip. Extended cruising range with 26 gallon tank.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I?ve had the truck for just about one month. At one month, every other vehicle that I?ve owned has had at least one little problem or there was at least one little thing about it that I didn?t like. I haven?t had any problems nor have I found any thing I don?t like with the Sierra. It is comfortable and fun to drive. I did a mileage check that came out at 19 MPG. I drive 70% highway and 30% city. At highway speed (60MPH), it is so quiet that I don?t need to turn up the stereo. The average load in the bed is 500 to 700 pounds and with that load the truck handles very well. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The cruise control and headlight systems are great. The basic radio interior and finish are very good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm just pleased to death with my purchase. I got the SLE Crew Cab with the 5.3l ad Texas Edition pkg. I also got leather and all sorts of extras for $30k. Just looking at the truck is pleasing, it's gorgeous, I got the Stealth Grey Metallic with cashmere interior. I get comments all the time on it's color, even my wife says it's beautiful! I wasn't aware that the SLT had a different interior layout, but I do like the way mine looks. It could use some wood in the interior, but that's all I'd add. The small details are impressive. The fit and finish is amazing. The tactile feel of everything is amazing, the leathers, it's just quality through and through.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks (so much nicer than the Chevy)! OnStar, backup assist, chrome trim!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in my 2007 Duramax classic body for this truck. It is the best truck I have driven. It's fun to drive, great build quality. Great highway ride and good off road (but sits a little low) Handles ice and snow like dry pavement. I would recommend this to anybody loking for a change from the rough riding poor handling truck of a few years back.</TEXT>
