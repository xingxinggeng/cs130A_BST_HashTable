<TEXT>The best feature of the Jeep is it's ability to go through anything. It has great ground clearance, a solid four wheel drive system, and room for four with plenty of gear. That being said I have been disappointed by the cheap grade hard plastic interior, weak engine performance, and white knuckle highway driving experience. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation System is outstanding, exterior look, and go through anything ability</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Jeep Wrangler to drive in winter. Although I have not driven it in poor weather yet, I really love my Jeep! It is so much fun to drive. I sit up high but do not feel at all like it is a big car! The controls are very convenient and easy to use. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my X sight unseen via email with my dealer. I took the only X they had at the time. I have wanted one for quite awhile and have been completely happy with my purchase. It's is so much fun to take the top down and just drive. Mileage is 20-21 which is good. I bought it for the winter snow, but am sure I won't be able to wait for spring.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 200 Silverado single cab z- 71 for this vehicle because of a growing family. I love the jeep and have ever since I rented one for a week. This thing gets so many looks and is very capable off road. I really love that it can fit two car seats in it and I can still feel like a real man...lol.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the 3-piece hard top, the axles and 4.10 gears. I also can't wait until it's lost its life as a family vehicle so I can transform it into something much more superior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased the jeep to tag along with our RV. It has been the perfect choice. My wife loves the way it drives around town, its comfortable on the highway. We have been able to go places that we never could have in a less capable vehicle. We are now able to go on unimproved/unmaintained service roads in MT, and CO to do hiking and photography. The gas mileage is much better than expected. We have never gotten less than 20mpg, over the road I get 24+, and of course my wife gets 26+. She just has a gentler right foot. Its getting to the point now that if I want some "Jeep" time I might have to get one for myself. We are thinking of getting small trailer, and heading up to Alaska in 2010.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The freedom it gives us to go places that would be impossible to reach in a less capable vehicle. We have done some hiking that was impossible before. The ride, and handling is excellent much better than expected. We are really pleased with the gas milage, after the terrible reports we had heard.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have wanted a Jeep since high school and when I reach 65 I bought a Wrangler X 2 door 4WD. I really love driving the Jeep, my wife drives a lincoln and I have not driven her car since buying my Jeep. In fact she had to go out of town last week and asked if she could drive my Jeep. I get between 20 and 21 MPG driving about 65 MPH. I have the 24S option which has every thing I wanted. I will use it as my tailgate vehicle this fall and look forward to talking about my SOONER red Jeep.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the soft top and the ease of driving in town and on the road, the wind, and we have a lot of wind in Oklahoma, is no problem. The sound system with the speakers on the roll bar is great. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It is nothing fancy but what a fun car to own. Have both a Wrangler and BMW 750i. Would much rather drive the Jeep. Nothing better than cruising around with the top down on a Saturday afternoon. I highly recommend this vehicle. Get ready to wave at all the other Jeep owners. You are part of a family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my first Sahara in 1998. I Put 100,000 miles on it with no major problems. Just bought a 2009 2dr Sahara...absolutely LOVE IT! I must admit I test drove other SUV's before making my purchase. The others just don't compare. The Sahara is solid, rides great, is quiet (with hardtop) and is a very reliable, fun vehicle to own! (and, if you have to, you can go wherever you want!)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, cargo space (for golf clubs), Infinity stereo, smooth ride, turns on a dime (and turns heads), Freedom hard top is easy to use, no blind spots. Previous Jeep owners will definitely appreciate...New Jeep owners will be glad they bought!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I planned on buying a base Wrangler X and tricking it out myself. My wife talked me out of it a said to get a 2dr Sahara. Thankfully I listened to her. The convenience features are great. The ride is good and the quality is among the best vehicles I've owned. The freedom top is easy to use. I had the Dual Top Group and have no intention of using the soft top. I sold the soft top to purchase a Banks Cold Air Intake and Cat-back Exhaust. Hopefully, this will add some much needed power. I would buy another one in a heartbeat and recommend it to anyone that is looking to add some fun to their daily drive. I had no idea this much fun could be had on four wheels.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Freedom Top is awesome as well as the Infinity sound system with the subwoofer.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned cars and trucks from across the pond for the greater part of 10 years and loved them, that is until I drove a jeep. I did not set out to buy one, I actually was at a Landrover dealer and decided to schedule a test drive in a jeep for a comparison. Needless to say I didn't go back to Landrover. The look, the rugged feel and the down to earth attitude jeep owners have has solidified me in the category of lifetime jeep owner. Its funny I bought my son an 08 Dodge Charger for his 16th and he has asked on more than one occasion when he can trade it in for a jeep. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Like most reviewers I was always a very cautious car owner. I test drove a Wrangler and had one ordered and signed for within the hour. Fun to drive, handles great, just an overall fun toy. I would highly recommend the power package, as well as the upgraded sound system. The bass is amazing! Nothing beats a nice Wrangler, with the top down after a long day at work. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stereo hands down. I drove a Lexus before and it blows the Lexus premium out of the water, even with the top down. Nice peppy V6, the 4x4 is unparalled to anything out there. I can outclimb and out run my FJ Cruiser friends. Soft top is super easy to operate, even with one person.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is not a car to drive to the grocery store and bring your Grandmother/Mother/Sister/Wife/Girlfriend/Mistress! This is s purpose built "offroad" vehicle with some garnish of comfort. The Navigation system is excellent and leaves "crumbs" to find your way back on an unmarked trail. The 4WD system is best in low range when you lock the front and rear differentials. Do not skimp and get a cheaper Wrangler, you truly get what you pay for with the Rubicon model with beefier axles, better gearing, offroad tires, differentials, and an electronic disconnecting anti roll bar for better wheel articulation. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy to wash! Freedom Top is remarkably refined and easy to take off. Bumpy ride quality to fend off the fluff. Fantastic brakes with thick rotors. Buttery smooth shifting automatic. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Jeep, within a few days of taking delivery I took it on a 500 mile drive and I can say that it was a pleasure to drive. The 6 speed manual trans was very smooth. The soft top buffered quite a bit doing 70 to 75 mph when the cross winds were strong and with my window open (but, would like to add that I did not purchase this vehicle for the highway). Even with some strong desert cross winds the Jeep was very stable and sure footed. The AC worked extremely well in the 100 plus degree weather, on the highway and in the city. I did add the 17 inch aluminum wheels to the deal, which gave the Jeep a little more ground clearance and gave it a better look.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Simplicity of the total package, very cohesive in design in regards to what a Jeep is all about. The stock stereo works just fine for me with the speaker well placed (more then enough volume). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wanted one since high school but avid Consumer Reports guy and always drove Hondas and Toyotas. Not so good Consumer Reports ratings for Wrangler but hey, had to have one to see annd experience for myself! So far, so good. Top rating: FUN TO DRIVE! Folks, there's no other 4 door convertible out there and with 2 kids, this is the one that has room to haul the youngsters and the weekend gear! Topless driving is a breeze with the sunrider soft top. Undo the rain flaps and some clamps, and in 5 minutes you have a massive sunroof open to the passenger row. The complete removal takes 2 people and 15 minutes though. Outdoor free air driving: PRICELESS. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Driving topless! The ride is surprisingly smooth for a true 4x4. Creature comforts of sirius radio, power doors and windows, remote lock, side rails all standard. Drove a Honda CRV EX before, ride is comparable. Love the speakers built into the top roof bar. Subwoofer also standard.</FAVORITE>

I absolutely LOVE my new Jeep! It is a beautiful piece of equipment and very easy to handle as well! My son is already calling dibs when he starts driving! So I am the coolest mom in town LOL! I have not yet taken it off road, but I definitely plan on driving it up and down the beach!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I would have to say the fact that you can just take the front 2 panels of the hard top off. You still get the feeling of being one with Mother Nature! And it is BEAUTIFUL!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've owned numerous brands, various models. Traded a 4X4 Suburban for a Prius. We missed the off-road experiences and recently purchased the '09 Rubicon (kept the Prius, thank God). The Rubi was taken off-road immediately in the California desert. Buttes, sand, rock, highway, all very enjoyable. The side airbags were a must for our family. The Navi with it's "breadcrumb" feature is a plus. Music beats and movies move with the sound system. Very happy with the decision to buy this Jeep. v/r, br</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Jeep's looks and Rubi's off-road ability. The vehicle in Orange Burst Orange is an eye-catcher. Oh, the tires survived razor-sharp rocks during 3 climbs of our favorite butte (2 other 4x4s I've brought there suffered flats and didn't make it to the top). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my 09 Rubicon 4 door JK just recently. The first thing i did was take my wife out to Hollister Hills to see what it was capable of... We spent the better part of 5 hours on every "Blue Diamond" trail (Intermediate rating) and it just asked for more! 4 low and all locked up with the sway disconnect,this thing is ridiculously capable of more than you might be tempted to throw its way. So far, I have basically made the undercarriage bulletproof. big tip of the day is: 1- ARB front diff. cover 2- AEV rear diff. slider This JK has exceeded my expectations thus far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Know what you want. Everything in Edmunds' review is true and is what I like about the Wrangler. I've only had my X model about three weeks and haven't had it off-road, but it turns heads, handles well and fellow Wrangler drivers wave at you (no small feat when living in a city), and you wave back. If you want a sturdy, truck- like vehicle, you'll love it. If you want an SUV that rides like a car, get a Cherokee. A Wrangler is what it is, the soft-top is noisy, no surprise. The interior is basic, well duh, but it's more comfortable than the wife expected. And if my 53-year-old wife (oops) can get in and out of the back of the two-door, so can you. Research and drive one before you buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first Jeep was a liberty 06. I just recently purchased an 09 2 Door Wrangler. First let me say I'm a college student so I don't mind a little bit of ruggedness. I drive up to Phoenix from Tucson (160 mile drive) three times a month and I have to say I don't mind driving on the high way at all. I have a hard top. Ive dricing with no top but I find best is to drive with only the two front panels on. MPG are best at around 65mp: I've seen around 23, 24 mpg. But I usually do about 80mph so I avg like 18mpg. Around town I've seen 13 (I know). I haven't taken it off roading yet but it is such a fun car to drive and ride around in especially if you live in a nice place like Arizona!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a 2003 Jeep Liberty Renegade and was very impressed by the durability. I traded the Liberty in for a 2009 Unlimited Sahara 4WD, which is far superior to the Liberty. The Sahara drives smoother, is more comfortable, and more versatile. I love the freedom hard top. I am able to remove the front half without help. I purchase on with the navigation system, which I highly recommend. It is also a DVD Player and allows for me to upload my music in the system-No more CD's!! Even though it was difficult to trade the Liberty, I am very satisfied with the 4-door Sahara. Plus, you cannot beat Jeep's Powertrain!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Jeep and I absolutely love it, great vehicle to drive, there is noting on a paved road that can stop and nothing off-road that cannot challenge it. You pretty much pay $20+ for a toy, a head Turner.. Every time I drive it (with softop down) I feel like I am on a safari or on a beach.. And with the unlimited after market options available there is always something new to spice up ur ride.. Its not been 2 months yet and I have already spent $1000+ on it....</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first new vehicle was a 1979 CJ-7 and I had to get rid of it when I started a family. I always swore I'd have another, and with the kids gone, the 30 year anniversary of my first Jeep seemed like a great time. This one is far superior in comfort and ride, but when you the pavement ends, it's still a Jeep! I bought it for $6K off sticker and have have a blast buying after market add-ons for it. This vehicle is just plain fun to drive, whether on or off road. It is not my primary vehicle, but I consider it a safe alternative to riding a motorcycle. If you've always wanted one, get it! If your more concerned about mpg and cargo space than fun, forget about it. I have no regrets!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owner a string of BMW's then a MINI and thought they were fun to drive, but the Jeep is a blast. It IS a Jeep tho, and do not expect sedan like ride or all the bells and whistles in the interior, but if you want a vehicle that goes anywhere, turns heads and is just more fun to drive than you thought you could have then a Jeep Wrangler maybe for you! It came with satellite radio and power windows/locks and I thought - ahh ok, but I have not put in a CD or listened to commercial radio since I drove it off the lot. The Jeep is similar to my Harley in what is available aftermarket; I already have off road bumpers and look to add wheels and tires, headers, exhaust, etc. in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my '08 Rubicon two-door for an '09 Rubicon four-door(my family is growing!) about a month ago. The '08 turned out to be a great Jeep, but it had a couple of initial problems with the hardtop leaking and a defective catalytic converter. My '09 is trouble-free, and I couldn't be happier. I used to think the four-doors were ugly, but the look has really grown on me. They're only about 20 inches longer than the two-doors, and the amount of extra space you get is amazing. I'm not quite sure how the engineers did it, but I sure like it! Plus it's a Rubicon. I've owned a lot of cars and I've never been happier with one of my decisions. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tough, straight forward Wrangler. Some deride them for being truck-like and primitive with some hard plastic surfaces in the interior. Well, you can leave it out in the rain with the top off if you want! And I like the 3.8L V6. It's powerful enough for me, and much more fuel efficient than the 4.0.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After months of searching and comparing, we finally purchased a 2009 Unlimited. This is our first Jeep and our first American car in a long time. We got the Unlimited X with all power options, satellite radio, tow package and dual tops. As you search for your next vehicle, remember, your comparison is not between other SUVs and the Jeep; it is whether or not you want a Jeep. If you want an SUV, then get an SUV. If you want a rig that will go anywhere without the top on, then this is the rig for you. If you want to take the doors off, then go ahead, why not, only Jeep owners can! The ride quality is better than expected and the Lifetime Powertrain warranty (original owner only) is great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Satellite radio - not something we necessarily wanted but it came with the car. We love it! The ride quality is very good. The Jeep does not drive like a BMW but then again, it is not a BMW, it is a Jeep. The BMW's in our town have their front ends damaged from deep snow. The Jeeps do not. </FAVORITE>

I saved $7500 off sticker and got 0% financing for 4 years. I never thought I would find a deal this sweet. My other car is an '05 Porsche Carrera. Call me crazy, but I have only driven the Porsche once since getting the Jeep. I was planning on giving the Jeep to my son when he turns 16, but we'll see if that actually happens. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Wrangler 4-door Sahara for 3 months and have had no problems. I have a long daily commute to work, but since I bought my wrangler I don't mind the 68 mile round trip. This Jeep is fun to drive. The 3.8 v6 engine has plenty of power and with 4,000 miles my combined city/highway mileage is 20.6 mpg as of today. My hardtop has no water leaks and is surprisingly quiet at highway speeds. The standard 18" Bridgestone tires are the best rain tires I have ever driven. No snow here in LA (Lower Alabama) but we have plenty of rain.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased a orange 2009 Sahara 2dr hardtop. It is loaded with all the goodies that make driving fun and comfortable. It is very quiet even at highway speeds and free of rattles and squeaks. Handling is good and it has a very tight turning radius, the ride can be a little choppy at times. The auto trans/eng combo works well, smooth shifting and adequate power along with 20 mpg economy. The exterior.... Awesome! The interior... Is somewhat unrefined with a lot of hard plastic, the seats are very comfortable. The climate control works well as does the my gig system, all of the controls are easy to use and the instrument panel is easy to read. I really enjoy driving my wrangler, it rocks! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I just feel good driving my wrangler, it looks great and its a lot of fun to drive. The my gig system works well for me and the remote start is great for those cold mornings.

<TEXT>Edmunds review is too harsh for the Wrangler Unlimited (4 door). Ride is more sure-footed than the 2002 Liberty it replaced. Styling is simple, and superb. Gets many compliments. Gas mileage runs about 16.5 local driving; not much highway experience yet to comment. Two option musts: side air bags (<$500) and hard top. Fabulous deals to be had (I'm in Northeast); 0% financing over 4 years. Buy American. This vehicle is styling, fun and fabulous value for your dollar. If you have to buy now (like me) think about this one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this Jeep about 2 weeks ago and I love it. It handles great on and off road and the soft top is much quieter than I expected. My wife and I hit some trails this past weekend and this thing is unstoppable. We covered lots of mud and rocks and it never even slipped. My only complaint so far is the operation of the soft top. It comes off fairly easily, but getting it back up was tough, though not as bad as I have heard some say. Bottom line: the Wrangler jk is awesome!</TEXT>

The straight-six 4L engine has given way to the venerable 3.8L minivan engine, which has more horsepower, but less torque. The gas tank has been moved forward to improve the angle of departure. The soft top can now open partially, and the 3-piece hard top option makes for easier removal. Sound system is improved with larger speakers and dash-mounted tweeters, with Sirius satellite as an option. Tow hooks and fog lamps are now standard equipment. Vehicle feels larger, and sits higher. Outstanding off-road.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great looks, much more comfortable to drive daily than the outgoing model. Gas mileage has improved also to about 20MPG on the highway. Wranglers are always fun, in winter or summer. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've always wanted a Jeep, but with 3 kids it never happened. But with the Unlimited 4dr, it's now possible. I got the Rubicon with remote start, dual tops, GPS, and other extras. This thing is awesome. The new Orange color for '09 just seems to glow. Haven't had the top off yet, but can't wait for Spring weather to lose the hard-top, which is actually very quiet on the road. The longer wheelbase of the Unlimited removed the "squirreliness" on the highway that the Jeeps of yesteryear seemed to suffer from. Even the 2dr version is much more stable than the pre-2007 Wranglers.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>GPS Navi with hard drive that stores 4000 tunes, big BFG's with aggressive treads, Power windows/locks (on a Jeep?? oh yeah!), Rugged good looks, fuel economy for an SUV is quite good, no shortage of aftermarket customization products, 4.10 gears, beefy axles</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am very satisfied to date with my purchase of an '09 Unlimited Sahara. I ended up getting a fairly loaded Jeep, dual top, 6 disk CD, GPS, chrome package. It has a comfortable interior and highway ride. With the hard top option the ride is as quiet as my HD pickup. The exterior look is outstanding. I plan on keeping this for quite a few years so added the additional Jeep bumper to bumper full life time warranty. I never thought that I would own a auto, especially a 4X4, that had a lifetime B-B warranty. This lifetime drivetrain and optional B-B warranty were the icing on the cake that sealed my decision to go with a Jeep over some of the other competitor products that I had reviewed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>exterior look, very confortable front seating, sound system, fun to drive</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've always wanted a Jeep Wrangler but never could quite justify not having the ever so practical and boring sedan. Finally took the plunge in 11/2008 and WOW! To think that I could have been having fun in this vehicle years ago! Not only is it fun to drive and will go anywhere, its a real head turner. I still have a sedan for work but when I really want to drive instead of commute - I take my Jeep. Like the title of this review says, "Love my new Jeep"!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style, accessories, fun to drive, sirius radio. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned two other wranglers in the past, the latest being an '01. This one blows the other away. The exterior, as always, is beautifully designed. The interior has more leg and hip room than the previous generation, and the soft top is remarkably quiet. I just took this on a 150 mile mostly highway trip, (in some nasty wind)and wind noise wasn't that bad at all. It did sway a bit in high winds, but that is to be expected.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the 6-speed manual. The sunrider top will be nice in the spring--I don't have to take the whole top down if I don't want to. Satellite radio is kinda nice, too.</FAVORITE>
