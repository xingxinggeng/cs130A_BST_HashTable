<TEXT>I have my own business and to be honest looking at all the other trucks i would buy the same truck again. No matter what i do to it it keeps on going, whether its in a farmers field or hauling a trailer. No matter what it is it will do it with ease and comfort and that is what a work truck should be. I have a 2009 F250 and a 2008 dodge 2500 and even with the 4.3L I still take it over my 6.0L powerstroke diesel and 6.7L cummins because it is just so nice to drive no matter what is in the back or what you are pulling. That i what a work truck should do.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>the pure ride comfort is second to none as stated previously </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought in Feb 09. With 29 miles on it, it started having extended start problems. After 4 months and 5 trips to repair, they finally realized the fuel injectors were leaking and replaced all eight; seemed to fix the problem. Other than that very nice truck. Could be a little plusher inside and provide more storage, particularly in the rear seat area. Drives as good or better than my 09 Honda Pilot. Fuel economy not great, but hoping to improve. The brakes squeal quite a bit, but only after sitting for a day or two.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drive: very smooth and quiet. Transmission shifts are outstanding. XM radio.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought my 2009 Silverado and I have enjoyed it a lot so far. I had a Sierra previous to this truck and this truck is very quiet compared to my old one and this one even rides smoother. I am happy with the truck and hope it is as reliable as my old GM product. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the towing power, like the bucket seats with center console.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Way better than my 2007 Classic 5.3 Silverado was. Smoother faster stronger more options better gas mileage. AFM works just fine. The 6 speed automatic is about 8 years late but now that it's here it was worth the wait. It's a much better unit than the old 4 speed. Frame much stronger, bed is mounted right up next to the cab now and when you jam your 4 wheeler in there it won't bend the top of the bed anymore. It drives WAY better than the old ones...I had to zig zag at 70 mph to miss a stupid deer and the rollover and brake system work well. The new dual zone climate control actually works now too. 13000 miles in 3 months because I love to drive it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated Leather, Auto All Wheel Drive, that Wonderful 6 Speed Automatic and it's Manners, The Whole Truck Really...Lots of Details. VERY Quiet on the Hiway even at 85 MPH. Fuel Economy...I have got around 21 MPG running 70 a couple times. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my Silverado in Jun 2009, I upgraded from the Chevy Avalanche, yes upgraded. The Silverado is smooth, and cool. Fun to drive, handles like a car, moves like a Truck and this vehicle demands attention. The 20 Inch Tires, sleek Rims, Black with Silver Trim. I have also added the chrome light covers and some chrome to the tail gate. Looks very nice. This vehicle gets up and go. Very quiet. Bottom Line, Love it. Love the Active Fuel Management.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Only had the truck for 2 months, but am very pleased at this point. Tows like a dream with the 6 speed tranny. Averaging 18 mpg, but that's a mix of in town and some highway. I expect it to get better once broken in; only 2,000 on the truck at this point. Put a 70 series flowmaster muffler and duals on it. It sounds so good. Took advantage of the zero interest rate back durning July's promotion. Overall am very pleased.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great power, sweet ride on the highway; little noise. Gas mileage is pretty good for a truck. Bucket front seats are nice. The rear seat folds up super easy; I understand this was an issue on prior year models.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my 2009 Chevy Silverado Crew Cab WT with 4.8 V* for under $20K. I don't think there is a similar value anywhere currently. Truck handles like a dream. WT trim is surprisingly nice. Decent stereo, satellite radio and onstar are great additions. Interior is simple and nicely designed. High quality for a work truck. I average 18.5 MPG which is amazing to me given the size and capability of this truck. I tow a race car and this truck is more than capable to tow my 4000 lb rig over mountain passes. Sale price of $19988 made this a no brainer for me. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great Chevy V8 powerplant makes me grin when I hit the gss peddle hard. But over all its the whole package and value.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Loved the truck when first bought, but noticed occasionally that the transmission shifted hard. With only 3400 miles, decided to take a trip to the keys from southeast ga. Before we reached Miami, the truck was jumping in and out of gear. We stopped at 8:30 pm to check fluid lever, there was no fluid. Called onstar, they sent a tow truck that never showed up. Had to rent a room, find a dealership to replace rear seal. Continued on trip, on return same thing happened, continued on refilling fluid. It is now in the shop getting rebuilt. So now I have a brand new truck with rebuilt transmission. Have only made 2 payments. Am I thrilled or what!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the 2007 Crew Cab (31,000 miles)with the 5.3 liter. I love the truck until my oil light started coming on. It has come on several times about 2,000 miles after i had the oil changed. Chevy said it is normal and they have me doing an oil consumption test. I am NOT happy and very disappointed. It might not seem like a big deal now, but who know what i will be consuming in another 10 or 20 thousand miles. I am considering trading it in!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the truck in April, I love it, good power from a v6, comfy interior, looks good. The only thing I didn't like is days after I bought it was in the shop for a loose gas cap. The engine light came on cuz of it. Dealer was very fast in getting the truck back and I have not had any problem since, I would recommend this truck to anyone</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love driving this vehicle, just recently returned back from a road trip. From Virginia to Atlanta, GA. Loved every min of driving the Silverado. I let my Son drive for a while and I enjoyed the back seat. Nice and quiet. I went to sleep for about about 2 hours. Not only does it look good with it's sleek styling, but it drives great. We have a JAGUAR and a Jeep Grand Cherokee, the Silverado is the Road Vehicle. I am a Chevy Man.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a nice truck but there are some major design flaws. The heat/AC instrument panel is very difficult to use. It takes your eyes off the road too long. Why did they design the fog lights to only work with the lights on? Don't they know that when it's foggy, or blowing snow that the lower the lights are, the better? Also, the low beam lights should be the lower set of lights for the same above reason. Why is the rear floor not flat under the seats? I owned a 2002 Silverado that had more storage room. The 2009 took away alot of storage in the dash and console area. Also the storage in the doors is smaller. I really do think that a "non" truck user designed this new truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is simply the best truck I have owned. It not only performs the work functions I need of it, but it is more comfortable and rides better than I expected. This from a base extended cab WT. I can only imagine that the higher you go in terms of options, the better it would be. I highly recommend the '09 Silverado.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comes standard with auto/air/CD and other extras. The seats are very good for base level.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had the 09 LT for three months and have 10K on it already. Putting another 3K on it next week. Ride is very good and the Z71 package gives it more stability in high wind conditions. The 6 sp auto or manual transmission is fantastic. Pulled a loaded 18' trailer through a blizzard and never had to touch the brakes in traffic, just went to manual and controlled speed with the touch of a button. The only other vehicle I can put as many comfortable miles on is my Mustang GT, but the truck rides much better. Keeping it at 65, 19.5 mpg not unusual.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The new Chevy may be the best overall buy. Test drive one and and listen to how quiet and smooth this truck drives. The 5.3 has great pickup and alot of torque. The seats are the most comfortable seats out of all the top ranked trucks. I pull a 20 foot bass boat 3 days- 4 days a week and this truck is the perfect buy for me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 170 degree rear doors. Smooth transition between 8 and 4 cylinders.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I ordered this truck w the 6.2, max pack, and love it. Plenty of power w a lot of power. It is a pleasure to drive and with all kinds of extras. I have been a Ford man most of my life but after months of research I ended up with this truck. It is just what I wanted. Don't concern yourself with gas mileage because its a truck but go w what you want and you will be happy. Gas prices go up and down. If this what drive you then get a motorcycle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth, nav system, backup camera, plenty of power, ride and the handling of the truck. Interior is beautiful light and dark cashmere leather.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this truck in March of 2009. Parked it in the garage for a week and took a trip to Tampa Fl from TX. drove 900 miles and the transmission burnt up. used my ON Star (the truck wouldn't move) They did a diagnostic check and told me all was just fine.hmmm.Got it to a chevy dealer, instead of a new transmission they totally rebuilt the one that burned up. New clutches etc. In the mean time I had to rent a car spend a night in a hotel all at my expense. Then I received the truck back with a very large scratch on the hood that I will have to pay for to have repaired. Customer service for GM was no help at all.So now I have a new truck with 1100 miles on it with a rebuilt trans.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far I really like this truck. The ride is smooth and quiet. My snowmobile trailer, which pulled hard with my old Silverado, seems to pull much easier with the 6 speed in tow/haul mode. I don't have all the gear hunting and hard shifts. The bluetooth is a nice feature but I would think it would hurt their OnStar sales.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Integrated trailer brake controller. What a great idea for those of us ho tow larger trailers fairly regularly.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Some trucks did one thing better than the Silverado but none did everything as well. The technology involved with engine is amazing and the eight to four cylinder shift is not only seamless but transparent to the driver. Having small children I really appreciate the safety features. Although the truck was just picked up I have owned foreign full size trucks and the initial quality is every bit as good if not better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the ability to put the truck in AWD instead of having to put up with the shortcomings of a 4WD option only. It saves the tires and removes another item of concern from the driver, especially in bad weather.</FAVORITE>
