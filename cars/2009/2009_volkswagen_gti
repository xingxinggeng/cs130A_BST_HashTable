<TEXT>Great car, just what I expected and am very pleased with just about everything on the car. This is an Autobahn with 6-speed and shifts like a dream. For some reason the rear hatch washer leaks on the hatch window when open and leaks when the hatch is closed. Been to selling dealer 5 times and tech support has been contacted. Per tech, installed Tiguan check valve and the thing still leaks washer fluid. Anyone else have this problem?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great style, paint and body fits and performance is outstanding. Getting 25.8 mpg running around Phoenix and back and forth to dealer trying to get leak corrected</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looked for a car that had the utility of a four door hatch and was fun to drive - the GTI beats almost every other car on the market in the Fun-To-Drive category. There are some great forums for this car and some cool mods you can put on it. I'm getting 30 mph even when I drive it like an F1 car. Fun, Fun, Fun 'til my wife takes the GTI away......... Oh, yea - don't forget the Launch Control. It's a blast with the DSG and makes the car, with the paddle shifters, the coolest little hatchback on the planet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the car for 2 mo. What a great ride! I was looking for comfortable seating and 4 dr. The seating issues ruled out the Honda's and Nissan's. The doors ruled out the Mini. The car has taken a bit of getting used to the ride (a bit stiffer than my 97 Golf), but the control and response will just put a grin on your face every time. That and the fact that this ting gets up and scoots. All this and I just got 33 mpg on a recent trip up to northern CA. Averaging 26+ combined driving over 2k miles on the car. Go VW.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DSG transmission. Style and handling. 4 door access.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had the car 2 weeks and have nearly 2K miles on it, wont be driving it that much after the summer. I sold my 2001 182K mile Passat on Craigslist in 36 hours and was looking at a 2007 Lexus IS250. Tried to make 4 different deals for the lexus's but no one wanted to budge. Got fed up and went back to VW and got a the loaded GTI autobahn package for less than a 2 year old lexus. Apples and Oranges I know but I do enjoy the GTI, had many many compliments on it already. The sport seats are a little narrow and took a while to get used to but now I quite enjoy it. Hope the quality rivals the old Passat, that car would have been good for another 100K.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really wanted a smaller car, with decent gas mileage, good performance and a somewhat upscale feel without spending 40K. I also need a back seat for occasional passenger transportation. I looked at the civics, and just could not do it, it's seems like a kids car to me, I also looked at The toyota corrola (better gas mileage, but the most boring vehicle) absolutely no fun to drive. After test driving the GTI, I was sold, it was perfect, sporty, but comfortable, easy power, not a brute, easy to maneuver in the city, quick acceleration for passing and the best interior of the cars I tested. I'm 40 years old, and this car is a blast, but also very practical.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The best thing about this car: It's a comfortable car for long trips, and a great car for the city, it's also a sports car when you want it to be, it's really pretty fast</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2008.5 Mazda 3 Hatchback for my 09 GTI. After driving my wife?s 09 Rabbit I was sold on VW's build quality and driving dynamics but wanted something sportier than my 3. I absolutely hate the boy racer look of the new 2010 Speed3. I got an amazing deal on my GTI and haven't stopped smiling since I parked it in my driveway. The new GTI is one of the best purchases I have ever made and have zero regrets trading in the Mazda. Volkswagen has earned a life long customer from my wife and me with their fun to drive, reliable and well built vehicles. The GTI satisfies in every way. From the precise handling to the punchy 2.0 Turbo engine and quality feel, I could not be more pleased. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>VW build quality. Everything about my GTI feels solid. I love the response of the 2.0T, sharp handling of the drive train and excellent driver feedback. The car let?s you know exactly what it is doing without being harsh. My Mazda always felt unsure when pushed. Not in the GTI! Simply an amazing car</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The GTI is a great all-around sporty car. Good power, no turbo lag, good handling, nice interior with lots of room, good fuel economy, and it feels & drives like a more expensive vehicle. It may not have the outright power of a WRX, but the refinement and fun are a great combination for me. It handles great, is quiet going down the road, and I'm getting mileage in the mid-20's around town. It inspires confidence on back roads, and never feels like you are asking it to do something it doesn't want to.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>2.0T TSI engine, uber-cool plaid cloth upholstery, supportive & comfortable seats, refinement</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this for a few weeks and I can say it is a very fun car to drive. I was a bit disappointed that there was no bluetooth. Everything feels very solid and I can say the seats are very comfortable. I would opt for the 6 manual, but I have heard from other owners that the DSG was a blast. I am not a big fan of the plaid...so I opted for the leather...more power options for the seats would be nice and I dont like the roll switch for the heated seats (but they do work good). I had one major issue I got the 18in wheels and sunroof package and with such low profile tires 250 miles I hit a pot hole and had to replace the tire. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my GTI for about 7 months now, and I still get excited every time I get behind the wheel. It's got the style, performance, reliability and practicality covered, and it doesn't break the bank to own one. Great car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6 speed, interlagos, turbo, good sound system, the 2 door can seat four comfortably. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Engine is first rate with very little turbo lag and it has great torque throughout the RPM range. Handling is very good for FWD car and DSG transmission is awesome. Lightning quick shifts. Interior has nice materials and good ergonomics. Seats are great as is the steering wheel. VW got the big stuff right with the GTI. Unfortunately, the little details are what they missed. With only 1,000 miles on the clock my seat squeaks, my dash squeaks over every bump, my rear hatch rattles over bumps and there is an engine rattle between 2500 and 3000 RPM which is an issue with other MKV GTI's too. Unacceptable in a new car. I heard VW has terrible quality control and now I believe it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, transmission, suspension are first rate.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Very fun to drive. Handles amazingly well on windy roads. Braking is good enough. Great engine noise. No turbo lag whatsoever. Has all the power you would ever need in a front wheel drive car. Love the horseshoe wheels, though I got the 17" ones since I parallel park so much (already have some marring). I had a 08 Rabbit before and all the little improvements are completely worth it. I'm nervous about the resale value and long term reliability being a VW, although I like this car so much I can't see parting with it while it still runs. Plan to have it for a long time. Very easy to park in the city being a small 2 door hatch. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering wheel w/ volume controls, standard heated plaid seats w/ lumbar support, fancy pedals including fancy dead pedal, 6 speed manual gearbox, horseshoe wheels, ESP, free maintenance for first 36000 miles. Love that VW still sells a hot hatch in the states unlike Ford and Honda. It's best anyway</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>OK I have owned my 09 GTI for one week and find it not only a sharp and comfortable but great performer or run it smartly to get great gas mileage. Mine has the six speed auto and I find the shift petals on the steering wheel not only a great location but fast response from the gear box. My GTI came loaded with leather seats Satellite radio and many more features which makes for a very comfortable ride</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Shifter on the steering wheel, fast engaging turbo, and great looks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First thing I noticed is that this car isn't as fast off the line as the 1.8T I had (04 Jetta GLI). It had an upgraded ECU, but even with that turned off it was quicker than the TSI 2.0T that is in this new car. This is probably due to the fact the MK5 is a much bigger car than the MK4. Other than speed off the line this car is my saving grace. It is much smoother than the MK4 Jetta I had, and on long rides it's so nice. Manual is a must on this car. Also, I should have gotten the upgraded stereo because sometimes I just want to rock out that 6 free months of Sirius (could sound better) Do NOT get additional ipod adapter plug in that is in center console. GET JUST THE HEADPHONE JACK!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>-6 speed manual -18" 'Shredder' rims as I've gotten to call them -Heated seats -Feels like a cockpit when you sit in driver's seat -Momo-esque steering wheel -bi-Xenon headlights -Sunroof -Heated mirrors (yes they work) -5 years/90,000 mile warranty for an additional $8 a month</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just got my '09 GTI, and LOVE it! I traded in my '06 Audi A3, which had the same engine, and many similar features, but the GTI feels so much sportier. The engine is great, and DSG is awesome. I still have to gently break it in, so look forward to the day I can really test the limits :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>We needed to upsize from my 2 seater to something our growing family. The VW can hold 5 for lunch or 2 adults and 2 kids comfortably. My commute is 35 miles each way, this thing is great for moving through traffic on the freeway. It has a quiet interior and solid feel. The ride is superb. While some of the competition is stiffer and rolls less, that is a very low percentage of the real world driving needs. It is fun to drive in a nicely composed package.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought my GRAY 09 GTI this morning. Didn't go for the DSG, which costs 1200 more. Like the manual gear, just like in Germany. Very responsive and fast. the suspension is hard so you might feel a little bit bumpy. Like the SUNROOF and 18" all season tire. 24K is fair enough for such a car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power SUNROOF, 18" alloy wheels with all season tire, Sat radio</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought right off the truck yesterday! Fast, responsive, limited torque steer, and corners well on the 18" summer tires. AC is a bit weak in the Las Vegas heat (117 degrees!) but that's not normal summer heat for most. My other car is a BMW 330i and the VW is as much fun to drive...I do miss some standard luxuries such as built-in Bluetooth, but for 24K I'm not gonna be picky. This car is well built, solid, and performs as a German engineered vehicle should. Turbo lag is nonexistent for the most part, and the 6-speed tranny is descent, a little long on the throw distance. (I bought the standard not the DSG). Good by overall, I would recommend it to the budget sports buyer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turbo, overall design and looks. nice interior details, feels very comfortable. Great gas mileage.</FAVORITE>
