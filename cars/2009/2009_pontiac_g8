<TEXT>I purchased my 2009 Maverick Silver G8 GT in lieu of a BMW 550. Not only was the G8 almost $50,000 less than the BMW, it actually performed better. I am 6'4" and weigh 330lbs. I fit perfectly in the car. On the road, I average 28mpg, and about 15mpg around town. The car is very quick, and handles well. It has been trouble free up to this point, and believe it or not, the car is quite exclusive. I can go a month without ever seeing one on the road, and I live in N. Dallas. Sadly, the G8 is no more, but the legend will live on. I am very happy with my purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Best vehicle owned to date. Well beyond expectations. Bad idea for GM not to continue to offer this in the US. Want one bad enough...go to Australia. M5 killer for half the price. Also have a 2009 Vette with same engine...G8 can almost keep up! Only regret: no offer of an in-dash nav. This is one of the top 5 sport sedans in the world...bar none...regardless of price. At 415 hp, it's only $100 per pony. Glad to have one of the very few GXP's sold...hopefully a collector for the future.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Thi is one of the finest cars that I've ever owned: It is fast, well styled, handles well, and is quite comfortable. It is a shame that it wil soon no longer be available, since it is one of the very best four-door sedans ever offered by GM. I also owned a 2004 Pontiac GTO, and the G8 is superior to it in every way - faster, roomier, and better looking. The rear seating area is especially well done, with comfortable seats and plenty of head and legroom. GM should not let this car get away. If you are considering the purchase of a high-performance GT, get one of these while you still can.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The V8 engine is smooth and very quiet. Thanks to the Active Fuel Management feature, I have attained up 26 mpg on the highway, while averaging over 60 mph. One of the many subtle details that indicate this car's quality is the trunk lid hinge design: no doglegs intrude on trunk space.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car! I read all the great reviews on this web site before buying (Sport Red Metallic GT, V8) and the car has more than lived up to the rave reviews. The power is fantastic. Gas mileage is very good for a car with this power (averaging 19 to 20 mpg mixed highway/city). Over 25 mpg on highway when I can control my right foot. Acceleration off the line is amazing! I test drove the V6 and V8. Get the V8! It does not cost that much more and the gas mileage is almost the same. The extra power makes it that much more fun. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power and acceleration. Superb performance. Great look inside and out. Comfortably seats my family of 5. The radio is excellent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The GT performance package provides the best of both worlds I was looking for ... a quiet and refined 26mpg freeway ride to work and 0-60 in 5.3s performance car with exceptional handling on the 19" wheel package. Corners at 30-40 are a blast, not to mention highway ramps. I love how the vehicle's manual mode really lets the car perform. Its balancing is exceptional. It's ashame GM didn't come out earlier with this vehicle and even more so that it will not be rebadged over to Chevy. Having driven BMW 5 series, I'll take this car straight up. At 25K less, its not even close...</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had this car for 6 months and about 7000 miles. It is an incredible value and I have no regrets on the purchase. The car is refined yet powerful in a way that no other sedan in the 20's (real world price) can touch. The torque is always available and free flowing and lets the car cruise at highway speeds effortlessly. Mileage is acceptable on the freeway, quite bad (10 or so mpg) in stop and go. The interior doesn't match the exterior style-wise and there are a few cheap plastic bits but I can live with it and the styling is nowhere near as tacky as some past Pontiacs. Big flaw is passenger seat does not go back far enough for taller people. Car was delivered with warped rotors.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Other than the fake hood scoops and the just so-so rims, I love the looks of this car. The lines and proportioning are perfect. The interior is extremely comfortable for long trips. And of course the power...for what I paid nothing on the planet can touch it. Variable displacement helps the MPG.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have almost a year of experience with my 09 G8/GT. I am 63 years old and have owned many vehicles. My G8/GT has more bang for the buck than any of them. I get many positive comments on this vehicle for its looks and the way it goes down the road. Many of these comments are from people (including women) who have very little interest in cars. People ask me all the time, what is it. I have had NO problems with this vehicle. This car is quiet and smooth as a big Cadillac under normal acceleration. Get on the"Loud Pedal" and it will definitely put a smile on your face. The head and leg room (front and back seats) is very good and the seats are very comfy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Exactly what I expected it to be after reading the literature and tons of reviews. It is a great ride, and very willing to perform. A few minor oddities, like the cup holder placement and lack of courtesy lights for rear passengers, but nothing that affects the overall drive-ability. It is a shame it was cut. It was destined to be a top performer in the GM line. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a 2009 Pontiac G8 GT in White Hot on the 30th of December 2008. So far I have about 800 miles on the OD and the car keeps getting better. Here in the Burgh, the winter is sometimes a hindrance and yet I have had no problems with the rear wheel drive. One just needs to learn the right amount of pressure on the gas pedal and drive safe. I'm still breaking her in and will write more come summer once she's got a few thousand miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Pontiac G-8 GT is my 3rd Ponitac, and by far the best. I had a 96 Grand Prix GT 2-door for 10 years, traded for a 06 Pontiac Solstice and traded for the 09 Pontiac G8.

<TEXT>I love my G8 GT for a lot of reasons. All have been stated many times over in other reviews. However, I have a special reason to like this car. In past years when my wife and I loaded up previously owned cars with maybe 500 lbs of tools and luggage for a few months at our vacation house, I had to shim the rear springs to help keep similar (and safe) driving dynamics. In my G8 GT this past fall, the heavy load had little or no impact on my mormal driving experience. I credit this to the great suspension of this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for a week now love it. This is my first American made car. Very fun and quick car. What attracted me to this car was it put you in the mind of a BMW and not only that its a pretty red car but the fact is it was not many on the road which could be a bad or good thing but my thought was it would a good thing because it stands out from all the other cars and it does just that. People are always take a second look and comment on how beautiful my G8 GT is. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had been waiting for this to happen for some time. And it was worth it. I looked long and hard at the competition - Malibu, Accord, Altima, Camry, Sonata, Lucerne, etc. but this was the winner. I didn't buy it for the rear wheel drive, but for the size and style. It is very sporty looking, agressive even. The interior is clean, uncluttered, and straightforward. The switch gear location, designed to make the switch from right hand drive in Australia, to left hand drive in the US takes some getting used to, but it isn't too big a deal. I am extremely happy so far, and so glad to be ride of my 2002 Camry. This is a much more exciting car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We really thought that we had found our dream car, even though we traded in a 2006 330I BMW. We loved the whole look and feel until we drove our new vehicle home for the first time. Mind you, this vehicle was on the showroom floor, the odometer read 11 miles. While driving our "new" vehicle we first noticed that it did not idle properly and at various speeds between 30-45mph and 50-65mph there is a harmonic vibration. We have spoken with the auto specialist thinking that they would know what was happening since they are familiar with the vehicles they sell. We were told that this is normal for the 6.0L. We do not believe this is normal and we are still currently having these issues today.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Update from 9-28:purchased (oem)19in rim & tire, fits perfectly into the spare tire well.R/R air pressure sensor failed, quickly replaced by Pontiac. Mixed very easy driving yielding about 21/22. We don't drive very much these days, so gas mileage not a problem. Fretted about buying an 8 cyl, did not need nor want the extra horses, it just drove better than the 6 cyl. Quieter & many options were standard. Apparently no insurance penalty for the 8 cyl. Love the overall quietness & comfort of this car. Rumor has it GM is ready to do away with Pontiac. Would not have purchased it had I known. If this happens I guess the 5 year 100k warranty will be worthless. Too bad, love the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The G8 GT's performance is amazingly close to my Audi RS 6 (450 hp), which cost $85K in 2003. With a tune I suspect the Audi's only remaining performance advantage would be traction thanks to AWD. If GM had been turning out products like the G8 GT all along, they wouldn't be begging before Congress. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Great exterior styling, nice cool interior, except for the center battery and oil display (ugh!). Also, someone forgot to install the trunk sound dampening material lining; the dealer put in 09 sound material. Our 1996 Bonneville SSEi has a heads- up display and I wonder why Pontiac never pushed this and/or continued this cool feature in other models. Anyway, we like our White Hot G8 a lot; and, there aren't that many G8's on the road it seems and that's cool. It drives well, is tight on curves and moves out when you want to. It feels sturdy and solid-well put together.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the V6, it is extremely noisy, low gas mileage especially in town. I get maybe 24 on the open highway. They replaced the tires twice at the dealer and it still shakes at 65/70 MPH. The worst feature is the front passenger seat does not go back as far as the driver side. It is 5 inches shorter and anyone over 5 foot 10 inches is very uncomfortable. Pontiac attitude is poor regarding this</TEXT>

<TEXT>As I said in my title fantastic value for the dollar. Feels very much like my friend's 2008 BMW 550 for less than half the money and is actually a little faster. Great road car with great seats. The back seat is probably more comfortable than the front, and it has 7 series room back there. Gas mileage isn't so fantastic, but it deteriorates little with speed and it is more economical around town than my V6 Saturn Aura. I bought the car in Ohio and made a major road trip bringing it back out to Cali for the winter. I couldn't ask for a better vacation car. A mid 13 second, 170 mph, 22 mpg+ large, four door sports sedan for $31k. I can't complain much about that. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My parents got this car for me as a graduation present and I'm loving it. I went to the dealership to test drive the G6 when the G8 caught my eye. I walked right passed the G6 and asked for the keys to the G8. By the look of the car I knew I wanted it. My parents were sold on the fact that it had Onstar. Great car for anyone who likes to go fast. Before I never liked to drive places, now I volunteer to go anywhere. Great kick and speed for a 6cyl. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Considered the G8 among others including MB C350, BMW 550i. MB too small, 550i too pricey and rode way too rough. The G8 is my 'Goldilocks' car, just right, and 1/2 the price of the Beemer! Can't get over the value for the dollar. Have owned MB, BMW, Lexus before, every time I mash the go pedal the status issue disappears! Mileage on the road was actually 24.5, in town about 16-17 mixed driving. Can't tell when cylinder deactivation happens, but big v8 vibrates at idle like my old Camaro, shouldn't happen today. Lots of room in back for 6+ footers, huge trunk, a great 'family car' that will still open your sinuses from adrenaline when pushed. compliant but firm ride. Buy 1, You won't be sorry!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>crouching stance with 19" wheels, V* power w/economy (runs fine on reg unleaded), super comfortable seats front and rear, lots of room.

<TEXT>I had a Monte Carlo SS which was a great car but I really wanted a V8 sport sedan with rear wheel drive 4 doors and a generous trunk. When the G8- GT came out I waited until the 2009 model and purchased a GT with the sport package and the premium package. This car is everything that I wanted. Great looks. outstanding power, superb handling, exceptional braking, comfortable interior with plenty of room for everybody. I have the color Pacific Slate, which brings many compliments. This car is the best bang for the buck when you compare apples to apples. I am a strong supporter of GM and their products. My wife loves the on star system and the xm radio. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a phenomenal vehicle for the money and overall I am very pleased with it. My only complaint is the fact that the vehicle left the factory with a defect (hole) in the gas tank. It was discovered after a 1600 mile trip to Las Vegas. After repair I contacted Pontiac's customer service division about the problem from the safety standpoint and they really didn't seem to care. I love the car, I do not care much for Pontiac Motor Division's so called customer service. I will probably not purchase another Pontiac product due to this, but the car is a lot of fun.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just picked-up my G8 several days ago (9/24). My dealer had to do a locate and swap for the car to get my color (white exterior/solid onyx interior)and options (18 in all season tires, sunroof and Premium Package). The fit and finish of this car are perfect. The interior is done in high end materials and is nicely done. I knew since this car was designed by GM/Holden to be exported as a right/left driver I would have to deal with window and lock controls on the console (not an issue. Performance is better than I expected for an almost 4000 LB car. This car goes, the ride quality and stopping power speaks to a very well designed automobile. I'm getting 17+ mpg in the city. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 6.0 V8 is extremely quiet and has very good response. The 6 speed auto shifts smooth and keeps the MPG up. The G8's sound system is better than my Corvette's.

<TEXT>I thought my next new vehicle would be a compact electric or diesel SUV, until an unplanned test drive of the '09 Pontiac G8 GT placed it in my driveway. It is more than the silky power that keeps a smile on my face, and makes me find more excuses to drive more often. Over 3600 of the 6000 km in the first month of ownership was on a single round trip over mountain highways. Fully loaded with family treasures, we averaged 9.1 L/100 km. Great seat design and driving position allowed two daily legs of 1100 km with complete comfort. The handling inspires confidence and low stress on the twisties and road irregularities. All features demonstrate thoughtful, quality design and manufacturing care.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Passing power minimizes time on the wrong side of two-lane roads. A little push on the accelerator makes those pesky headlights disappear from the rear view mirror.

<TEXT>This car is the perfect replacement for people, like me, who are tired of the ever increasing price of Audis, BMWs, Volvos etc.. No price gouging on the options packages either. There are only three options, and they are all very reasonably priced. Just try to get a Sports Package on a European car for under $600! The car is an incredible value. Fast, great handling, great build quality, great looking. Also very quiet and comfortable. I've had M3s, 3 Series, 5 Series, SAABs and my last car was a Volvo S60R. This car shames them all, and at this price it's a knock out in the first round!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, roominess, handling and looks. And unlike any American cars I can think of right off hand (besides Corvettes), they got the stance correct and fender well gap kept to a bare minimum. It looks and feels like it could spend it's whole life on the Autobahn!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had an'03 BMW 325i that I drove to 100K miles, then an '08 Accord V6 that I hated from day 2...their cylinder deactivation was very noticeable, and now have 2K miles on '09 G8 GT. Have the same feeling for the G8 that I had for the BMW...let's go somewhere! Don't think I will ever get tired of that sweet engine rumble. Lived in Australia for a few years as a teen and admired the Holden's back then so great to have one stateside now. I'm in sales and live in my car. Very impressed with interior ergonomics, sound system, seat comfort, and low interior noise level on the highway. Way to go gm. Wasn't sure I would ever buy another one.

<TEXT>I am now into my second week owning this car and wow! You can't imagine how many heads this car turns. Obviously the HP is great out of the hole, but you really notice it on the highway with its passing power. The styling and handling is equal or better than anything I test drove before buying (CTS, A4, BMW 3). I can't believe their isn't more of these on the road already, it really is a big step up for Pontiac and GM. The one thing you really need to know is if you don't want to buy this car, DO NOT TEST DRIVE IT! Once you take it for a spin, you will not want to let go!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a Black 09' Pontiac G8 GT and could not be happier. I have been to the gas station a couple times and people come right up to me asking me all about the car. I too love when stopping at red lights and having the car rattle slightly from the V8 anxiously waiting to go. I smile every time I go on a drive and glad this was the first new car I have purchased. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have never had so much fun driving a car ever in my life. I drive like an old man in my G8 GT. Reason being if you hit the accelerator, she will fly!! But when you cruise, the G8 is quiet and smooth. The bucket seats will sink you in for a very comfortable ride. I love the armrest leveled with the controls in the middle for a different feel. Also I love the twitch that shakes from 6.0 V8 time to time from the as you sit in idle at a light. I never felt so good driving an automobile in my life. I have my Corvette for the fraction of the price!! GM has finally answered our prayers for a muscle car!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 6.0 V8!! I let my brother test drive my car at half-time of the Cowboys-Browns game this Sunday. When he punched it, his face lit up like a Christmas tree. He could not believe how much power she gave him!! Also, I like the Blaukpunkt system. Very loud</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 2009 Panther Black Metallic G8 GT is my first brand new car. Picked it up with 12 miles on the odometer. It has the two-tone seats, premium, sport and sunroof. The 6.0 L V-8 makes getting freeway merging and passing effortless, even when the car is filled with passengers and cargo. My G8 GT is a head turner and driving in it, is much like driving a in a fish bowl. At 6'2, finding a comfortable driving position was easy. The back seat handles 3 real-sized adults easily. The trunk will swallow 2-3 golf bags no problem. On a recent road trip we got up to 22 MPG on 87 octane. A lot of that trip was surface street driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, interior room, 6.0L V-8 with cylinder deactivation, and that not a lot of them are on the road - yet. Build quality is superb. Sunroof is huge and worth it. Cavernous trunk. Steering wheel controls. Information bank on dash.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>All i can say is this is the best car i ever owned. I can't understand why Pontiac didn't bring this car over sooner. I love the power of the v8 and the mpg are great for the engine size. This car to me handles better than the BMW 5 series. Pontiac needs to do a lot more advertising with this car. Its a 4 door vette. You cant go wrong with this one. It was sold before i even test drove it </TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at the 08's in May but so glad I waited to get a Pacific Slate '09. This car is the perfect balance between performance and price and brings back all the passion and enthusiasm for driving that the recent choices between fuel economy or expensive luxury have deprived us of. Driving is fun, fast and effortless and I honestly don't care about no nav since getting there in this car is 'all' the fun.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Pontiac G8 GT is the most fun blend of comfort, performance and style I have ever found in a car in this price class. It is my 1st brand new car of the lot, that is how highly I think of this car I risked to buy it new. It has tremendously good comfort, outstanding acceleration and low interior noise. I've put 4k miles on it in a month, and I'm extremely pleased with this vehicle, it has the best design and layout of the available space in the chassis. Comfortable dash and seats with superhigh quality feel, that was very lacking in previous years. I've had two Pontiac Grand Prix's before this, they served me well. But this is the NEW standard we see from GM. THANK YOU MR. LUTZ for the G8.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quality feel, interior/exterior roomy space, ergonomic. 26 Mpg on highway on 87 Octane is very good, suspension is awesome, huge trunk and glove compartment, acceleration and steering feel is even better. This is by far an underestimated car in the market, if you try. You must buy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought a 2009 G8 GT, Stryker blue. The color was chosen by my wife, I wanted Panther black but I am getting used to it! The car rides very well in comparison to my 2004 GTO. The ride is firm but not as harsh as the GTO. I have not really pushed the G8 yet but I expect great performance. Fit and finish are very good. My wife has received many compliments on the car's appearance. It has sleek and muscular lines. Difficult to combine but the G8 has them. I looked at the new CTS but the G8 offered a V8, Cadillac didn't, plus, at a lower price point ($10K). I looked at several imports, but I have bought American for over 25 years. Congratulations to GM for importing this fine car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I didn't really want this car. It was a gift. Now that I've had it a week, and driven it daily, I've fallen in love with it. I just want to get in and drive. It's a white G8 GT with all of the options, including 19" summer tires and two toned seats. I love the V8 but dislike the MPG, then again, what does one expect with a V8? The previous review said that there wasn't a trunk release button, there is, in glove compartment.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is ridiculous. Everywhere I go, it turns heads. Pontiac listened to all the customer suggestions on the 2008 and on the 20009, got rid of the oil & temperature gauges in the center console, added XM Radio standard and no noises other than the awesome purr of the engine as I upshift past overpriced German imports. The V8 blows doors on everything else in its class while getting surprisingly good gas mileage. If you want to enjoy driving again, go get yourself a 2009 G8 GT. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was lucky enough to pick up a brand new (45 miles) red G8 in Minneapolis for a week long drive around No. MN, WI and MI Upper Peninsula. I put 1100 miles on the odometer and developed a great first impression of this car. It is tight, corners superbly, handles great and drives like a car much smaller than it's size. GM really got this one right! Acceleration wasn't outstanding with the V6, but balanced against gas mileage, it offered plenty for everyday, long term driving. I averaged almost 24 mpg for the 1100 miles in combination of driving including pushing it pretty hard on some back roads and freeways. Nice car...I'll have this one on my shopping list.</TEXT>

It has more space, the same or better performance and is more fun to drive then an M5. I'm not interested in tons of electronics that will only fail and cause problems. This car is such fun to drive, I will never sell it. The fuel economy is great for the power/performance level. I get 20-22 mpg in mixed driving with the manual trans!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Pontiac. What a performer this car is. Eats everything on the road, can't keep my foot out of it. I bet it does get great gas mileage but I wouldn't know that yet cause I can't keep my foot out of it. Beautiful to look at in the Stryker blue I bought it in. This car is a rush to drive, feels so tight but yet refine ride. Massive power on tap all the time, with the TC off and a light power brake easily smokes those sticky summer performance tires. I wish I was rich so I could buy another one to stash away for a collector. I know these cars will be worth 10 times there sales price someday, so if you have one take good care it. If you don't you had better hurry up and get one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, very fast, damn good mean looks, extremely roomy and comfortable. I especially like the tire compressor that shoots goo in place of the spare tire to save weight. Plus you don't have to worry about dangerously changing a tire on the road side, women ought to like that.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have the car 2 weeks and have around 900miles on it. I have always been a car guy and have owned many cars including 5 series BMW, E series Mercedes & an Audi Cabriolet for comparison purposes. This car is unbelievable; in terms of pure off the line speed, it blows the doors off anything I have owned(including a 69 firebird with a 400 engine). Handling compares adequately to my BMW and Audi, a lot better then the Benz. The nice thing about this car is there aren't many out there so it is definitely unique, a head turner. The interior is plain but usable, the controls are adequate. In terms of styling, the car has great lines. I am 6ft and there is plenty of leg room front & back, big trunk</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car (G8 GT) 2 months ago after test driving my father's and just loving it. I got an excellent price from the Pontiac dealership who seemed to want to give these cars away. This car has everything I admire about the BMW 5-series: power to spare, aggressive styling, refined ride, an extremely rich set of features, and even a little cachet (I still don't see too many of these models on the road). And just as important, it doesn't have the one thing that is synonomous with all BMW's, a large price tag. Anyone who is interested in owning a BMW 550 at half the price should seriously consider the G8 GT. </TEXT>

Through the old miles driven divided by gallons used, my lowest tank has been 18.4 while the highest was 24.9(all highway, 70- 80mph). I look at the computer's mileage, and it's close, but usually higher than actual. The power is addictive. The car is quiet quiet quiet ! Fit and finish are really good, doors close with german exactness. This is a driver's car, it doesn't come with tons of gadgets that you don't need, about the only thing I've missed is my auto dimming mirrors.

More interior room than a BMW 750i, More trunk space, super comfy, great handler, V8 hauls. Have had all the imports, BMW, Merc, Lexus,Infiniti, this one tops them all. Enjoy driving it so much I took the family to Vegas in it, 3k miles total, averaged 24 mpg @ 85+mph loaded to the gills across the desert! In town expect 15-16 mpg. I am seriously considering buying another just to mothball for when I run this one into the ground! GM- PLEASE keep this car, maybe as a Chevy Impala? Try one, you'll love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a shame. GM finally gives us this wonderful car, and POOF, it is no more. I purchased my 2009 G8 GT in June of 2009 after much thought and consideration. I ended up choosing this car over the BMW 550i. I am simply amazed by the car. The stupid grin that refuses to leave my face when I am driving the car is priceless. At 6'4" and around 300 lbs, I find the car very comfortable. There is also plenty of room in the back seat. This car is all about the drive. It handles amazingly well, and the acceleration will astonish you. I never thought I would buy a GM product, but I am so glad I did. I am now a reformed brand snob. I love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased a 2009 Pontiac G8 with the 3.6L V-6 a couple of days ago, and I'm saddened that GM is killing Pontiac. This car is absolutely the best car I have ever owned. I honestly feel that this is also the closest GM has ever come to the BMW 3 series. If Pontiac has to die, then why can't Chevrolet pick up the G8 as a Chevelle or something. At the price this car is an unbeatable bargain, and if I had the money I would by another one tomorrow (a GT). The only change I would like to see is for the 300hp direct injected V-6 to be installed. Then it would be absolutely perfect.</TEXT>

<TEXT> This car snaps. It's tight and comfortable. One does not know what it has to offer until one drives it. It is fun and fast, and unassuming: No one knows what it it until it roars in speed if not sound! The premium sports model keeps one interested; and OH! How I love the DIC, in all its guises. Please transfer this gem to chev It is different enough from the crouched, sporty Camero to deserve a life of its own. If it goes to Buick, expect it to be 4or 5K more expensive. Perhaps, it needs its own,new brand! Don't let this baby archive. GM would be absolutely insane.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is absolutely an incredible car! Finally Pontiac has gotten it right -- unfortunately right before it has to close its doors. If you are considering buying this car, now is the time and you will not be disappointed. Caveat--If you are looking for great gas mileage, buy a Honda, but if you want awesome performance with very decent gas mileage...this is your ride. It will get better mileage with additional after market mods(check the internet), which signficantly increases the horse power too. As a family sedan and sports car...I think your getting the best of both worlds.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had a problem with the parking brake not releasing has been to the dealer 2 times for this problem, was told there is nothing wrong.They said they replaced it I still have the problem. Their suggestion was my wife pulled it too tight, It was only pulled tight enough to hold the car on a hill. this is probably a design flaw that Gm either is not aware of or not willing to repair. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been a GM customer for years, owning a number of cars that were primarily just for transportation. The exception was my 1984 Buick Regal T Type (same as the Grand National, only in blue with chrome bumpers). I contemplated the G8 GT for quite some time I and finally purchased the same day that I helped my son buy a new Sierra. With all the GM incentives and my GM card points, I got the 34K car for 25k; how could I go wrong? Even the dealer said I could probably sell it for more than I paid. I think the styling, especially from a distance, is fantastic and the interior is beautiful; so the leather isn't on the doors, who cares? For a large 4 door sedan, it is impossible to beat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Stunning car. I was in the market for a new car, and I was shopping at the Nissan dealership because I loved my G35. Next door, there was a Pontiac dealership, and I remember being enamored with the the styling of the G8, but when I had first seen them they weren't available in a manual which is a deal breaker. Well, the GXP was out, and it was available in a six speed, and it was incredible. I walked out of the dealership with the new car that day. It was White, and traditionally, I'd never have purchased a white car, but I didn't care. This was the beauty with the beats under the bonnet.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine is wonderful. Reserved sounding, not noisy unless you're flogging it, and extremely smoothe power delivery. I'm also pretty sure that it would make good use of any aftermarket parts. The stereo is also very good. Not overly bassy like the systems from Bose and Delco.</FAVORITE>

The Pontiac G8 is the best car GM has produced in my lifetime, that's nearly 60 years, and from the looks of the near future offerings, it will be my whole lifetime! This car has great performance, outstanding styling, excellent build quality, and for a high HP V8, very acceptable fuel mileage. If you want one of your own, you best hurray! Even thou Pontiac will be around until the end of '10, the G8s will be gone long before that!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I evaluated the V8 versions of Audi A6, BMW550, Hyundai Genesis, Lexus GS460, Nissan, and Cadillac before I bought. G8 drove better, handled better, and accelerated better than the others. Traded in my BMW540 and am very happy with my choice. Superb acceleration, superior handling, great braking, over 21 MPG on regular gas, comfortable seating, and roomy trunk for half the price of the competition. Only car I have ever had where I did not wish I had more power. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had bought a fusion orange G8 GT just last year but but after learning about the demise of Pontiac, I thought it was time to upggrade to the GXP. The car is quick (about as quick as my 06' GTO)and the exhaust note is super too when you mash the petal. The GT was flawless for the 10,000 miles and the fuel mileage was acceptable (24 MPG to/from work). I don't expect that there will be any problems with the GXP either.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased this vehicle in February.I am thoroughly pleased with decision to buy it. This is the 1st Pontiac I have ever owned. Im looked at the BMW 3 series, Infinity and the Mercedes C300. The performance of this vehicle is stunning...it grips curves like like glue. The ride is even better than I expected for a sports sedan. The body style is an eye catcher and turn quite a few heads when I ride by. Thus far gas mileage is a combo of city-highway of 22 mpg Cons: would like to have had a home- link transmitter and better access to adjust the driver's seat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the 2009 SRM G8 GT with premium and sports. This is a driver's car, and is amazingly nimble for its size. The interior can be nicer, but that is not the reason why people buy this car. The AFM when engaged adds vibration. As a previous reviewer commented, the idle is a bit rough, but that is true of most cars with the LS series push rod engine. The handling is excellent for such a big car. It beats my previous front-heavy Accord V6 hands down. And the V8 engine propels the car to highway speeds in a blink of the eye. Unfortunately, the price one pays for such performance is high fuel consumption. All-in-all, driving this car is a blast and surprisingly comfortable. Great car.</TEXT>

I started getting tired of the cost of owning these cars and drove the G8 GT two months ago, and was hooked.

It seems like the Aussie's are the one's who are keeoing there end of the deal. People want more than just trucks and SUV's. Sure the fuel economy isn't the greatest, but let's be resonable here, it's a 6.2 litre! You have to pay to play. I put an air intake (RotoFab), aftermarket exhaust (Borla) and some SLP headers and that made a huge difference. This car is very responsive to performance upgrades, especially intake and exhaust.

I love being able to blow off ANY Acura's, Infinity's, Lexus's, and most BMW's at a fraction of their cost. Gas mileage on the first three tanks is 21 with a mix of city/hwy/and quite a few WOT demos for friends and family.Should improve as it gets broken in.Handling is great and the ride is a good compromise, interior space is better than anything else in this price range.

<TEXT>I purchased my new Maverick Silver Metallic 09 G8 GT about a month ago with all available options and wow. I've never owned a V8 prior to the G8 and am quite impressed. It's such a fun car to drive and was pleasantly surprised with the gas mileage. I averaged 22MPG on the first tank, 21MPG on the 2nd tank and 19 on the 3rd which is after I got through the break-in period and discovered the button to turn traction control off. ;) The ride is super smooth and refined. The exhaust is quiet until you slam on the gas, then you get the nice throaty exhaust note you would expect from a 6 liter V8. So far the G8 GT is exactly what I was looking for. Awesome ride!</TEXT>

<TEXT>have owned lots of dif' cars.. after living with this latest GM wonder..(only decent car they've tried to build in over 10 years). DRIVETRAIN: pretty good ! 4cyl. shutdown works!(23mpg@80 and under 14sec. darn good :trans- kinda close. suspension/steering..borderline lousy! steers hard at slow speed and too light at speed. rear end skips on ANY rough surface and the darn thing weighs as much as my previous crown vic..which with aftermarket sway bars, out handles it.... Interior sound system..1 on a hundred! other controls..fire the computer nerd ! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>at least GM tried..(but failed again)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had been researching my new car purchase for well over a year before I decided on the G8 GT. The overall feel of the car is great. It has plenty of power and just as important it has plenty of back seat leg room, 6'+ adults are quite comfortable. I've owned the car for 2 months now and accumulated over 3500 miles. Average mileage has been 18 mpg but I have not had much highway time yet. Taking a 1000 trip in two weeks so that will tell me what the real mileage is like.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car to replace my aging Trans Am. I am completely overjoyed with this sporty sedan...perfect blend of speed and comfort. Everything about this car is outstanding, from appearance, to acceleration, to creature comforts, to gas mileage, and so on. The size of the car is just right for handling, while the space provided for the driver and adult passengers in more than sufficient. The trunk is huge! The best part (of course) is when my friends review the car and then stand in total amazement when I tell them the cost -- very reasonable for everything you get. I can't believe I don't see more of this caron the road...people don't know what they're missing!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is fast, really fast. There isn't another car in this price range that even comes close to the fun, the speed, the features and the comfort. You just can't buy a big, 5 adult fitting car that can do the quarter mile under 14 seconds and reach 60 mph in under 6 seconds for anything close to $30,000. Not only is it great in a straight line, but it corners great as well. It has a huge trunk, and the stereo is as loud and as clear as any factory stereo I've ever heard. Yeah, the fuel mileage isn't great, but it exactly what I expected and gets the fuel mileage that is advertised. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Reality demanded I spend less than originally planned for a new car. I am very happy to have chosen so much car for the money. The GT looks cool, drives tight and has the most comfortable front seat of my better cars (TL, 300M, Aurora, Legend). I can mention some constructive improvements others have documented, but with research, you know these before you buy, such as the weak sound system, lack of some amenities and weird controls. The only issue after 2 months besides still not having the second set of keys lost by the dealer, is an annoying vibrating noise randomly coming from behind the glove box. We will see if it can be addressed by the dealer before commenting on GM build quality.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The G8 GT has everything I was looking for in a car - high end looks, great performance, good price, and a domestic make. Fuel mileage is good relative to the performance, but if the first thing you check out on a car are the EPA ratings - this car is not for you. I get great feedback from others on the car and enjoy driving it. My other new car choices were foreign makes but the domestic G8 delivers on all counts.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This is my first V8 performance car, and the acceleration is breathtaking. Great, comfortable leather seats. My kids love the full size backseat. Magnetic grey paint choice with the exterior design is very attactive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After owning foriegn for a while, I was leery about buying American again after being burnt by quality issue in the past. However, after test driving Acuras we tried the G8 GT and fell in love. The design, quality, and of course the performance are GREAT! I know I should have look for better gas milage, but when you can have this much fun, this much perfoemance, and still get 25 MPG what the heck. It's a great car at a great price, way to go GM!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>PERFORMANCE, PERFORMANCE, and PERFORMANCE! We also love the design, On-Star, and interior layout.</FAVORITE>
