<TEXT>My wife, baby boy, and I shopped for our new vehicle for about a month. We test drove Lexus's, to Toyota's, to Volvo's, etc...you name it, were were there. We were in the market for an SUV/Crossover. After driving them all, we found the Acadia to be the clear winner on all fronts: great & smooth ride for a large vehicle; super spacious; great gas mileage for this size of car (don't agree w/ other folks who are voicing their concerns about the true MPH?); and all the functionality one would want w/ a car in this class. We have had the car for two mos and are 100% satisfied w/ our purchase. Should n e thing go wrong, the 100k warranty should cover us...A+ car;oh, 5 star crash rating too</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in 2001 Yukon for 2009 Acadia. Similar passenger and storage space as Yukon. Occupies roughly same garage space. Acadia ride more comfortable. Similar turning radius. More visible plastic on interior, particularly dashboard and doors. Unlike Yukon, Acadia's 3rd row seats fold flat. Would recommend to others with children looking for family vehicle but interested in SUV rather than minivan.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Flat folding 3rd row seats. Numerous drink and cup holders. Color options.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I live in Canada, and have 3 very active boys who all play hockey. So l bought this SUV for all of us to travel around from arena to arena lugging around hockey equipment. Was pleasently suprised on the ride and the preformance. The interior has too much cheap looking plastic for my liking, but since it is getting alot of abuse, it seems to hold up to it. Gets decent gas milage for a vehicle its size. Had a issue with the defrost when l first purchased it. Dealer had to change whole venting system, but other than that, nothing. Tires are very hard to find for it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE> Its not a minivan!! Loads of room.. l'm 6'3" my middle son who is 11 is already close to 6' we have tons of leg room</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This may be the best SUV ever. It is a large vehicle so it feels safe. Get's good gas mileage yet has loads of power. The inside feels like a honda odessey except it has more style and loads much more upscale. This vehicle is great for a man or woman and really is a step up from a car or mini van. This is the best SUV yet!</TEXT>

<TEXT>All around I love my new Acadia. But beware of the sticker estimated MPG's. The sticker says 17cty/24hwy, my actual so far has been 13cty/17hwy. If I had known this before my decision may have changed on buying an Acadia. All but the poor MPG's I love my new Acadia.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Acadia is fun to drive and comfortable on 3 long trips we have made. It has lots of room for about anything, but the mpg we are getting is not even close to the advertised mpg. Made a trip to Canada and pulled my small aluminum boat and got only 12.25 mpg on 2500 miles. my overall mpg is now averaging 15.50. I only get 17 on the interstate with normal 65-70 speed. GM customer service did not seem to care what mpg we got, so just pushed me off and said sorry.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven Japanese for years, but decided to give GMC a try, first with a 2005 Sierra Truck and now with the 2009 Acadia. I have never been happier. My 2009 GMC AWD Acadia SLE is fully stocked, including dual sunroof, LCD screen, folding sideview mirrors, back up camera, heated seats, Bose sound system, tri-coat platinum finish, luxury leather interior, bluetooth technology, remote start, and more. My Acadia is a beauty. We average 6'3 in my family. Amazingly everyone is comfortable - even on cross county trips. The Acadia is easy to maneuver, accelerates with easy, gives a quiet ride and epitomizes the best in luxury and savings. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dual sunroof, folding sideviews, quick/easy conversion from seating to storage, heated seats, sound system, wireless headsets allowing use of audio system at the same time, leg room, quick acceleration for merging and power for uphill travel. I could say more. Just "check it out for yourself".</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving an fx-35 for four years, it was time for more room, but didn't want to give up the fun ride! Gmc has a winner with this one. Great spacing. Love the seating arrangement, sound system and blue tooth. Much quieter than the fx and smoother. Gas mileage is still in question, but so far am loving this crossover!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We`ve just traded our 2007 Honda odessy for a 09 Acadia, great vehicle. Feels big because it is, fun to drive, good looks, roomy interior and the kids loike it too. Gets expensive very quickly if you aren`t careful with the options, in dash 6 cd changer should be standard as well as a back up camera. Overall ( so far ) a great choice and a much better value then the Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our 2009 Acadia is the best vehicle we have ever owned. It is smooth, quite and very comfortable. As for mileage, it does better than the sticker numbers of 17/24. On a trip to the Indiana. I held the speed at 65-67 and averaged 26.3 mpg with the air. OT was 99 degrees in Macon, GA that afternoon. Returning, 70 MPH and averaged 25.4 mpg. OT low 90's returning. I have yet to find even the most minor thing wrong with our Acadia. And for me, that is saying a lot, as I am a retired engineer and can usually find something wrong with everything. But not this vehicle! We are totally satisfied. I congratulate GM for a quality build and for designing and producing this great SUV.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Disappointed</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I bought 2009 Acadia in March 2009 and have had nothing but problems. The dealership has tried to fix the air conditioning and pick up with no resolve of problem. LV is very hot and w/o good air, it is impossible. Freeway driving is terrible when a Prius passes you up with no acceleration. Car has been in shop several times with no fix. I would not recommend this car if they all drive the same way. No one wants to actually fix the problem. It may be a LEMON. GMC does not seem to care. So GM cars with all their problems may best be avoided to buy until they resolve to take care of customer problems or replace their LEMONS. Milage has averaged less than 17 miles to gallon more like 15 even HWY</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car is comfortable seating and I like the adjustable benefits of 2nd row. The instrument panel is also nicely highlighted.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Owned for 6k miles and could not be happier. Fun to drive and handles great with exterior styling to die for.. After ten years of Full size SUVs No roof issues or tranny issues as previous year models. I have found the perfect auto for me. Not a boat but not a low riding car. Not worried about GM being there, car well hold up until they remove the cloud over their future. Waited for three years after intro so GM could address any new product concerns. Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander don't come close to measuring up. This puppy is a winner!</TEXT>

<TEXT>G hit the jackpot with this puppy. This vehicle is a joy to drive and sports very stylish looks. At 6 feet 3 inches I am astonished at the interior roominess. I can even ride comfortably in the third row seats. My last vehicle was a 2007 Yukon and the third row seats were a joke. Car has lots of bells and whistle and the nav and sound systems are fantastic. I only wish GM would have used better quality plastic on the interior appointments given the price of the car. The engine is very responsive and the ride is very smooth. I test drove the 2009 Acura MDX and the Lexus RX 350 before buying. Both were nice but did not come close to the Arcdia in space, technogoly and smooth ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We love our Acadia, beautiful design but unhappy with the Check Engine Light being on about 80% of the time since we have owned it: 5 months. Each time its on I take it in, and all 3 times they say its the emissions and each time I get one new part: canister with hoses, next time it was the purge valve, last time was the fuel tank sensor --and after the car was on the lift and the tank off -oops, wrong part, so I got a rental car at their expense. 2 days later, check engine light on again. I have asked for a new gas cap -as it also says 'tighten gas cap" (we do) and I guess it all depends on GM and what they say. If it comes on again after whatever they do this time, I want another car!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>A couple of years ago I bought an Infiniti FX 35, it was very sporty and reliable, but it was too small and it bounced all over rougher payment. The Acadia (Outlook, Traverse etc.) has much more, is much more comfortable and has an incredibly smooth ride. GMC has a winner with this. I bought my Acadia about 6 weeks ago, I love it and so does my wife.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My new Acadia just became faulty. A month after I purchased it, the central lock broke down. After being sent to repair 3 times, the dealer still couldn't manage to figure out what was wrong. It would be great to open my acadia without using the key, driver door. It will also be great to get my kids in without having them wait outside in order for me to get in and open the windows to be able to unlock the doors manually. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had our new Acadia for about a month and although that is not a very long time we are really, really pleased with our purchase! It is fun to drive, has good pick-up, sits solidly on the road, very comfortable inside, has a great sound system, and the robust features of the navigation system are all we could want. Add in the Onstar capability and we feel covered in all respects. We bought the heavy black floor mats for rainy weather and find that very useful in the rear when we need to transport "messy" things. We feel good driving it -- it has a classy appearance, too. Couldn't be happier!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have been Toyota owners for most of our life, because of reliability. One day I was driving and I saw this car that really caught my eye, it was the best looking car I had seen in a long time. So I followed it, it was a gmc Acadia. I researched a lot of cars on the Internet, and I always kept coming back to the Acadia. My husband loved it also. And we have loved it for the whole 2 months we've had it. It has a really comfortable ride. I fell very safe in it, it has 12 airbags, and 5-star safety rating. My 13 year old son loves it. 2 months is not long but I pray that we will have it for many years and it will be as reliable as all the toyotas we had in our lifetime. We hope America has done it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the way you can either have three rows of seats or we can lay 2 rows down and only have 2 seats and the rest can be storage, or we can carry up to 8 people.I love the XM radio, the no hands calling features.You sit up high so you can see better.It is awesome to drive,I love how you feel in it</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is one of my favorite cars I have ever owned. Went from a Grand Caravan to this. With 3 kids the fact that they can watch a movie while I listen to the radio is awesome. The ride is terrific as well. Find the Navigation system is nice but has some funky routes every so often. Garmin hand held seems more accurate at times. I have the backup camera and don't know what I would do without it! gets you into spots nicely!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I rented a GMC Acadia this past week from Alamo - and ended up really enjoying this vehicle. We own a '07 Acura MDX and an '04 Sienna, and this SUV/crossover fell right in between on size, comfort, performance and mileage. From a size perspective, this car had more room with the seats folded down than our MDX. In terms of comfort, the leather heated seats, quad chairs and smooth ride were appreciated by the entire family. Performance-wise - it's not as tight a car as the MDX,but it remains a competent highway and city cruiser. . Mileage was impressive, and it's great to fill up on regular gas for a change. Would I buy this car -maybe - but would like to take the Buick Enclave first.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After test driving other vehicles in this class, including MDX, Highlander, Pilot, and Edge this vehicle had them beat for one reason or another. The kids; 4 and 9 sealed the deal. The size, safety features, design, and toys (must have toys) were the best. I came out of a 2005 Escalade that couldn't touch this and the Acadia has more space in and behind the third row. Loving this truck!</TEXT>

<TEXT>we liked everything about this vehicle. I rides just a bit harder than thee Enclave, but after owning a dodge Durango for five years we kind of liked a little bit of the truck/suv feel to it. We had to purchase a one year extended warranty to extend the life of the loan out to 72 months instead of 60, and also built into the loan dvd players in the head rest of the two front seat the come with wireless headsets for $1,650. This will keep the kids from fighting more.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle has the transmission problems of previous models. Ours had 3600 miles when it died in the middle of a busy highway. Towed to a dealership, and the dealership was unable to figure out what was wrong with the vehicle after nearly four days. GMC absolutely no help and not willing to honor the warranty or have the vehicle brought back to us since it died more than 350 miles from our home. Best they would do is provide a crappy rental car. I would avoid this vehicle--when GMC goes under, you'll be stuck with a money pit your mechanic will love.</TEXT>

We traded in 06 Buick Terraza and we had nothing but trouble with the Buick so we gave GMC another shot no regrets.This truck is actually roomier than the minivan but drives like a car. I don't have the 4wd, we just got 6 inches of snow here in Chicago and this truck has not yet got stuck anywhere. It's amazing. Not to mention how safe it feels to drive rain or snow the drive is smooth. I highly recomend this vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first car made by an American company. In the past I owned Honda, Toyota, and most recently a 2005 Acura MDX. Before I purchased the Acadia I test drove a 2008 MDX (did not like the looks of inside/outside) Highlander (nice, but still not there), 2009 Honda Pilot (did not really care for the interior). I finally decided to take a look at GM's offering. Decided to test drive the Acadia first. Once I was in it, there was no looking back. The interior design and comfort of this SUV is amazing. Seats and ride are comfortable. The technology is also top notch, and I am a techie. Please, just because this car is a GMC do not make the mistake of not adding this car to your list. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav system, Bluetooth, OnStar, 2nd row captain's seats, roominess, remote start, and color (Dark Metallic Blue). Gas mileage has also been good, averaging city at 18.6 mpg, highway at 24.3 mpg for a FWD. Not bad for a car this big. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A few weeks into the purchase and I find it a pleasure to drive. Though, I can't be sure if it still suffers a little tranny shifting issues like the 08 did. I'm not really a car person, but doesn't seem as smooth in some instances. I wish I paid a little more careful attention to the plastic dashboard and other pieces. While at first glance the interior looks great, a closer look reveals all the plastic which will probably get scratched in the long haul. It's textured, so good luck getting scratches out. So far, it's just a fine car.</TEXT>
