<TEXT>This is my 8th Ford truck and 4th F-150. Although it is the lower-end STX, I find it more comfortable than my previous 2005 Lariat. The seats are more comfortable (although I have to agree that the headrests need to be less intrusive). The transmission is better matched to the engine's needs and thus the 3V 4.6L feels more powerful than my previous 5.4L. I didn't think I would ever drive a truck more comfortable on the highway than my Lariat, I was wrong. Smooth is the only way I can describe this truck. A nice feature of my particular truck is that it has the carpet delete option so I don't have to worry about mud and snow messing up the carpet. I just wash it out.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are the SYNC system and the satellite radio. I am on the road a great deal and they make the trip less fatiguing. I also like the great amount of storage throughout the interior, particularly the extra storage under the middle front seat. Also, lots of cup holders. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I never expected such an all around excellent performer. This truck is very comfortable, quiet and very capable in every way. One reason I picked it over the Toyota Tundra is the large gas tank, 36 gallons vs 26 gallons. The extra capacity is very helpful when I'm towing. Other great towing features are the integrated brake controller, and sway control.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Back-up camera, and distance sensor. Navigation, and sound system are first rate. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I looked for 1-2 year old ones to replace my 2000 and was not finding what I wanted for the money. I am very happy I decided to go with new. I have been getting between 18-19 with the 373 limited slip rear end. Most of used trucks I looked at were beat up or they wanted almost new price. I got mine for invoice. Been very happy with truck so far. The transmission and fit and finish I feel are quite nice for the price and it is a quiet solid truck. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My F150 has 16,500 miles now. I can't say enough good words for it. I just want to say: everyone must have this truck! This truck has a 18-19 combined MPG so far. It can do everything what a sedan or SUV does. It seats 6 people. more room. more comfortable. It can do many things a sedan, SUV, mini-van can't do. You understand what I meant. I go hunting, fishing. I help people move their heavy, large stuff. I buy stuff for my house and garden. etc. Everyone must buy a F150. Only F150!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great ride, very comfortable and quiet. Got the 5.4 engine as I got a great deal on an advertised package, and the mileage only 1 mpg less. Getting about 14 mpg in the city, about the same as my old 97 f150 4.7 v- 8. I noticed in consumer reports, they mentioned the truck engine to be a little loud, and the ride a little rough. Wow, I would have to disagree. This engine and tranny is silky smooth and quiet, everyone comments on that who has been in the truck. I test drove some other trucks, but this one really feels luxurious.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall comfort and ride. Really comfortable seats except for the silly headrests. The sync electronics better that the system in my wifes new lexus, can access phone info, ipod playlists, no problems.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I laughed when I read that another guy's wife sounded off about buying American. My wife did too as I was considering the Tundra or Tacoma but never got to the dealer. I did test drive Dodge, GMC and Ford. In every category from deal to doors I like the Ford at least a little better. GMC was a strong consideration and felt more refined but I wasn't looking for refined. I was looking for some big & bad truck and I found it in my black XLT 4X4.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tall stance, big chrome, built Ford tough mojo and it drives great. The wife likes gettin' on the throttle for some beefy exhaust tones. That's what I'm talkin'.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Replaced my 07GMC with new Platinum F150 4X4. A/C blows hot for 1st 15 miles. Dealership says is normal because it eventually cools off under 20 miles:( They drove it for 100 miles and didn't do anything,except refill fuel tank:( Vents blow 20 deg hotter than my other cars. Paid $54 for service at an A/C shop in Conroe and it was only low on freon! You'd think Ford would be willing to warranty $54 to keep a customer. Calls to Ford support were replied with - sorry the dealer says it is normal. So here it is. Nice truck and you'll like it unless you need A/C, or unless you need to use the warranty! GM please stay in business. Anyone want a new Platinum 150? LOL</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Awesome Music, Sync. Nav, Weather display (needs loop display), interior quality.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've always owned GM vehicles, but the new F150 Platinum outshines anything else on the market. It runs great, gets better gas mileage than my old GMC and I get nothing but compliments on it. When I get out of it, random people always ask if they can have a look inside. The Platinum is the nicest truck I've ever seen or owned and yet still very functional. The power running boards are the feature that gets the most "wow" factor. I would not hesitate buying this truck again. The exterior looks great and the interior is as comfortable as any luxury sedan out there. I love my Ford F-150 Platinum.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>- Power Running Boards - Microsoft Sync - I stream Pandora via Bluetooth from my Blackberry through the stereo and it sounds great. - 20" rims - they just look sweet. - Comfortable Air Conditioned Seats - no more sweaty back side. - Decent Fuel Economy for a big truck - Rear View Camera</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It took me 1 year, researching the Internet and 50 test drives of every truck out on the market to make my decision but I chose the 2009 Ford F150 FX4 for my family. Interior was by far the best and back seats were very roomy. This is the truck to buy Here are my takes on the rest of the trucks Dodge Ram Hemi 4X4 Crew- Interior still looks cheap and Hemi makes a whole lot of sound and no go. Toyota Tundra 5.7 4X4 Crew- Very fast truck but interior was off key and frame not as strong as the domestic three. Nissan Titan 4X4 Crew- Decent truck but mpg was the lowest and the ride was jittery. Chevy/GMC Trucks 4X4 Crew- Back seats where for children only and interior was cheap.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Back Seats, very comfortable and roomy. Not much has put this truck apart from the rest except that this truck is well put together and all of its features are easy to use. It is just a well thought out (listening to its customers) truck.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was skeptical about the 09s because Im not a big fan of the front ends, so I test drove the Dodge Ram 1500 for the weekend. Loved the look of the truck but the back drivers window squeeked going up and down. The drivers door grinded opening and closing and the volume button came off, all in a matter of 3 days. I cant imagine what else would go wrong with it in time. The Chevrolet looked good, but the truck is nowhere near as big in the inside as it looks on the outside. The interior build quality was about a 5. I test drove the 09' F150 and wanted the Lariat, but couldnt afford it but the XLT "for the price" is a VERY nice truck, quiet, gas mileage is GREAT and the 4.6 ltr runs good.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The new guages look nice in the day and at night, the fuel mileage is incredible, the comfort is great and the build quality is top notch. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Was ready to buy a Toyota Tacoma when my wife said --- you can't buy a foreign truck. I immediately went to the Chevy dealership and then for some reason decided to stop buy a Ford one after that. Although I have always thought Chevy has a more classic and attractive body style, I was blown away by the interior of the Ford. Simply put, an outstanding and elegant design. It was a tough choice but was able to get a better price on the Ford and so went with it. So far, I love the truck. Has a less powerful feel than the Chevy even through I got the 5.4L but it is still more than adequate for my needs. I have to thank my wife for pushing me to American - better product than Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded an older F-150 and wanted a new truck that had the same features. I'm glad I did because it performs better than expected. I priced other trucks in the same class and found this new F- 150 has a far better exterior. It's quieter and the interior was tops for the money compared to a Dodge, Chevy, or GMC. First week after purchasing the truck it turned heads and had people coming up to me in parking lots just to say what a great looking truck it was!! After a long drive with the family (over 8 hours), even my mother-in-law had to say that it's a hell of a truck in comfort, ride, and interior space. She even liked the look and price! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior space, and quiet ride. Hauled a trailer and boat soon after purchase and the power of the truck was impressive!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ford has really done there homework on this one. I traded in my 2007 Dodge Ram for my new 2009 F-150 the only thing I miss is the hemi engine. Other than the lack of a little power over the hemi this truck is light years better than the Dodge in every other way. This truck is fun to drive! The power from the new 5.4 is nothing to laugh at though. This will serve me just fine. The only thing I notice is the inside door panels push you in the truck to keep you away from the windows so as in an accident your not in the way of the side curtain air bags. This makes it just a little uncomfortable however nothing you couldn't get use to. Look around at this truck, you'll find a lot of neat things!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The "SYNC" system is unbelievable. The room in the cab is almost as much as the "Super Duty's" The safety Ford built into this new 2009 is next to none. I also like the sound of the exhaust, Ford also redesigned this to make it sound throatier. The six speed transmission makes this truck jump alive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 2 weeks of ownership I couldn't be happier with my decision. My previous truck was a 2002 F150 and the 2009 is light years ahead in refinement. I couldn't believe how quiet the truck is, allmost as quiet as my wifes Toyota Highlander. The sync system is awesome, hook up your Zune and everything is voice activated. I was concerned about the gas mileage coming from a 6cylinder to a V8, believe it or not I'm averaging close to 19mpg in mixed driving vs 15mpg with my old 6 cylinder. Build quality seems good no issues so far. Very happy with my decision. Would highly recommend a test drive for anyone trying to make a decision. Forgot to mention I received 5K in rebates when I purchased.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck is the best truck I have owned. It is comfortable, rugged, can hold a lot, and has conveniences that make it a pleasure for drivers of any age. No more skinned knees or sprained ankles getting into and out of the bed, and the side steps make reaching into the front of the bed a snap. I really like the cargo management system to control movement of smaller loads. The seats are a notch above others in this class, much more comfortable than the 2008 Tundra I just sold. Visibility is great, even the radio sounds good. Having owned and driven well over 20 trucks over the years, my comment that it is the best I have owned actually means something. Avg hwy miles 21.3 and city 14.2. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Platinum model is a real head turner. Have had several near traffic accident misses as people staring at this truck and not paying attention to driving. Even other brand truck owners like this truck. Leather interior is great and fairly comfortable on long trips. Real world fuel mileage is 10-18 MPG without using 4WD. Really like this truck. Best F-150 I ever owned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Deployable Running boards, heated and cooled leather seats, 10-way power drivers' and front passengers' seats, Rear view camera, fairly flat rear passenger floorboard, tailgate step, sits high for better road view, deep pick-up bed, more room in rear passenger area, 4WD, and new Royal Red paint. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>WOW, I thought my 2005 SuperCrew drove and rode nice, this truck is awesome. The 5.4L has plenty of power and gets good gas mileage, averaging 19.2. It is so quiet and has so many great features and ideas encompassed in it, like the improved tilt wheel(my 2005 tilt was the pits with that bulky handle underneath the column), the improved tailgate extender that separates, microsoft sync, the compartment to the right of the steering wheel my Blackberry fits perfectly in, the size of the interior( I think you could sleep two back there comfortably), the sony stereo, it is just a greatly improved truck. Ford really out did themselves on this truck. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything is so much improved, but I guess the rear camera feature is my favorite. I back into my garage and it sure is nice to know how far away you actually are from the back of the garage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having owned five F series ford trucks since my '66 long bed. I am glad i got this 'puppy'. I had a bad experience with the 'T'-word truck. they are not trucks, they, the 'toys' are a joke. Ford trucks last in the long haul and can take highway punishment. The massive ford boxed frame is awsome, the equally massive suspension system is a joy to behold. the power of the 4.6L is going to get me a ticket if i'm not careful. so get yourself a radar detector, and use it. the cruise control is flawless. Yes, as some have said, the head rests stink, just pop 'em out and turn 'em around, problem solved. the middle 40-20-40 seat in the front, bugged me so i took it out ( 4 13mm bolts).</TEXT>

<TEXT>First Ford since 1988. Wow! Never thought I'd come back. Ford has outdone itself with the new F150 Platinum. The 5.4 V8 power is good-not great. Averaging 17 mpg overall with 90% highway time. The interior fit & finish is fantastic. Seats are super comfortable. Power running boards are a nice touch. At 6'7", the F150 has plenty of headroom compared to Tundra, Chevy, & Cadillac. Towed 23' Airstream from Ohio to TN. Other than higher RPM's & lower gas mileage, the F150 barely knew it was back there. Averaged 13 MPG over 500 miles towing. Again, great job Ford. </TEXT>

<TEXT>recently traded my 2oo5 f150 king ranch in for 2009 same version , the 2005 had no problems but the gas mileage was only 13.5 to 14.5 non towing and 7 or 8 towing two horse trailer .the new truck is averaging 17.3 to 18.5 not towing and 11 to 12 towing.the interior is much more refined with darker red/brown leather that will show less wear and staining then older version.the hood design has been changed so one can see more hood in front which is now sculpted and more enjoyable to look out over.the interior is much more refined with a much nicer dash and center console and the rear seat area is cavernous.Love this truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Previously wrote a review. HEre's the bottom line. Love most things about the truck, but here's my beefs after 1,000 miles (Platinum Version)- I have a very bad back and initially thought the seats would be comfortable, but between the fact that the steering wheel is such a long reach once seat and pedals adjusted all the way to the floor, and because the top of the seat tilts forward, it is not comfortable at all for more than 5 minutes- to 99% of people, this would be no problem. Also, the steering wheel has two problems- if you're tall like me (6'1"), your knees will hit the back of the steering wheel, kind of aggravating. This thing desperately needs telescopic wheel. Mileage in town 14</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>luxury features,safety, Nav,sync and bluetooth great, auto running boards, slick tranny,fantastic audio system, great ride, steering ratio could be quicker. Rear seat legroom outstanding, but seatback a little too upright for total comfort. Build quality excellent-no squeaks- great deal,$10k off</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well my 1985,302,fi, finally went to help some concrete from falling down (sadness). But alass i have found another truck to love for 300000 miles. The power when punched with the H.O. 4.6 is surprizing. It will cause ur wallet to empty at the tire store. The inside is a great update from my old tank. the sound from the 6 cd sirrus radio is beautiful. the seats are comfortable and the room is big enough for a dead body with the back seats up. the outside styling is another reason to buy this truck. the new styled tailgate that weighs half of the 85s and the chrome grill is an eye catcher. The new alloy wheels are another great update. I compare it to my 85 but the wife drives an '05 4dr.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The new 6-speed automatic takes a little getting used to, since the first 3 gears are spaced so close together (3rd gear by 20 mph). But it allows for better fuel mileage and towing, so it's worth it. Yes, as the other reviews have mentioned the stationary head rest takes some getting used to, but it's rarely an issue. Very smooth ride, quiet, and stylish. The Lariat interior (spring for the captain's chairs with the floor shift) is very, very nice. There are so many little features that add to the comfort of this truck that you'll still be discovering (and appreciating) them a few weeks in. Give it a test drive, you'll be surprised how nice it is.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design (save for the head rest). All the little extras (memory seats, tailgate step, capless fuel tank) just keep making the truck more and more pleasurable to own.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looked at everything on market- saw the competitive videos that Ford did, that, plus the fact that it is an IIHS Safety pick made the decision-even tough I liked the looks of the Dodge better. Go for the Platinum, you get the deployable running boards, infinitely adjustable tilt wheel and much more for less than $1G more than the KRanch. Others talked about the headrests, they can be bent back out of the way w/out hurting the seat. Only have about 275 miles, all in town, getting about 12mpg, about as expected. This is one ritzy truck, rides like a Caddy, hauls like a Superduty; safe, strong, well built- can't go wrong! Will update later when I know more about MPG over long haul. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fully articulating 10 way seats for BOTH Driver and Pass (for those of us with bad backs, this is a must-have)- NAV, SYNC, Bluetooth, smooth ride, towing stability control. Extra sound insulation in Platinum works! Smooth 6spd, beautiful interior looks like it was designed by Audi- simply gourgeous!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I keep writing reports because everyone must know how great Ford Trucks are. I just sold my 05 FX-4 with 92,000 for $15,000 and that truck was great. Not one single problem! I have had this 09 since late October, and between horse trailering and work, I have accumulated 17,600 miles. Friend and I did 2800 mile roadtrip from NJ to FL in Feb. and I ave. 19.1 mpg doing 75 with ac on and that includes the Orlando and Miami Beach traffic ( and I have the biggest combo Supercrew 4x4 with 6.5 ft bed and 3.73 rear and 5.4) The ride and handling are great. I pulled a car trailer loaded with 69 Torino and 73 Suburban at the same time for 80 miles, no problem. This is simply the best truck on the road!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned several Toyotas, just sold my O4 CrewCab Tundra. I was blown away with the quality and features of the Platinum F150. This holds up well past the first impression. Now have over 3,500 miles in 3 months and haven't found any flaws. Interior room is cavernous and perfectly appointed. The reason I bought this was the rear floor space when you fold up the seats. New Tundras have NO floor space in back since seats only fold down. The Synch system took longer to learn than all other features. The blue- Tooth phone provides the best quality call ever, even vs the handset on the phone. Gas mileage exceeds my old Tundra, never less that 13.5 with best 15.5 on a highway trip.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Front seats are incredibly comfortable. The other reviews with headrest concerns just haven't adjusted the seat properly or they're very short. I'm 6'2" and it's a perfect fit. The Rear View camera with range sensor is very handy, especially when someone walks behind you while backing up.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Haven't purchased one yet, but soon will-looked at everything else- really liked the dodge, but safety rating on Dodge(side crash) unnaceptable. Superior ride, billet solid, no squeaks. Seats MUCH more supportive than last model, last one hurt my back after only 10 minutes. Ford did their homework-anti-trailer sway control might save your life-only thing I disliked is the gawdawful grill-I'm from TX, where everything is big, but they went overboard! Last model's grill much more attractive. Will purchase Platinum vs King Ranch- price it out, there's less than $1,000 difference, and you get the automatic running boards that are actually in the right place to use as a step when deployed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Solid, quiet ride, limo like backseat, beautiful interior, orthopedically designed, fully articulating front seats, safety features superior to anything out there; innovative features like tailgate step (great for people with bad backs),power side steps (Platinum only)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased a new 2009 Ford F-150 4x4 XL Regular Cab. I Love the truck except for 2 flaws in design. First...The head rests protrude out from the seat back about 5 inches which pushes your head in a lookdown position. The seat must be reclined back in order to level out your head so you are looking out the windshield instead of down at the bottom of steering wheel. I turned the headrests backwards which now has zero protection in the event of a rear collision but it now is comfortable. Secondly, The 2 openings on either side of license plate has 2 brackets that Fords engineers have no clue of what they are for, sitting there and is an eye sore,these holes are for extra cooling. The holes supposedly, according to the engineers route extra air up to the radiator for engine cooling. If this is a fact, Ford should have installed air intake ducts to direct air up to the front of radiator...not filled the back side with a rubber mat, enclosing the area. </TEXT>

Bought the Ford instead of getting another Titan and definately made the right choice! It Looks better, better gas mileage, more comfortable and roomy. My family and I have taken numerous trips to see my family out of state in this short time and the family loves it! Average about 20mpg on the trip when I set the cruise at 75 very pleased with that. Just a great buy and great truck. My first ruck was a Ford and have owned a Dakota, Ram, Frontier, Titan , Ranger and will only buy an F-150 from now own! Love it. Over 500 miles a tank! 5500 miles so far..</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety sensors and the back-up cam are great! Excellent braking, traction assist is nice and crash test ratings look steller-don't want to find out.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I ordered this about 2 weeks ago; it is being custom built for me by Ford. The deal was amazing. Great price for a great truck. I have some upgrades from the king ranch and platinums I test drove; I am getting the dvd headrests and the dealer is obtaining a lexan roll-up bed cover, which all pickups should have. We ordered the white sand tri-coat metallic and the 20" KR wheels, navigation/Sync and moonroof. The whole thing is a luxurious work truck that does a fair job of passing as a limousine. Wonderful blend of technology, industrial design, strength, beauty and versatility. I compared this to Dodge, Chevy and Toyota. In the end, the Ford had the best combination and the best $.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior and interior design (reminds me of a Lincoln inside), Sync technology, versatility of lexan- covered rear bed, comfort, huge rear seat/loading area, great looks. Excellent organization.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned many vehicles over many years, including many trucks. This new Platinum series F150 is definitely one of the best. Incredibly quiet, comfortable and well built. The new 6 speed automatic with tow/haul works very well. Fuel mileage is on par with what you would expect for a vehicle of this weight and size, but I actually find it to be better than many in this category. This truck is so good, even some of my Chevy truck friends are looking at Ford! The combination of comfort and utility, with 11,100 lbs of towing and high load capacity is unbeatable. Kudos to Ford and Ocala Ford dealer for a superior product!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We wanted 4WD pickup toughness with a spacious cabin, and a smooth, quiet highway ride. We got it! We drove the Dodge Crew Hemi and the GMC Sierra Crew. In our minds, Ford won hands down. The GMC CrewCab way too small. The Dodge came in 2nd with better Discounts/Rebates, but we felt the Ford was worth the extra money. I wanted the 3V 4.6L with the 6sp Auto. I have seen up to 22mpg driving 60-65. Still has a tow rating well over 9000lbs. Plenty of power with the 4.6L. In my opinion, if you don't need the extra towing of the 5.4L then get the 4.6L. Fit/Finish excellent - no rattles/squeaks so far. My wife never wanted to drive a truck before this one - now I'm stuck with her car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I carefully reviewed all of the hoopla surrounding Chevy Silverado 1500, GMC 1500, Dodge Ram 1500, Toyota Tundra and Ford F150 2009. I ordered the new 2009 F150 King Ranch, to be custom built at Ford's Dearborn factory. I will take delivery in about a month. The test drive was great; this is one solid vehicle. Not a dragster like the Tundra, but who cares? The Ford won't twist and rack like any of the other 1/2 ton trucks in its class when going over dirt roads and I can tow more than the others. Also, the box is higher, which means I can fit more stuff into it and the exclusive rear step help me get into the box without crunching my knees on the tailgate. More later after I get it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great new styling; I love the architectural dash redesign! Sync is amazing! I didn't realize all the things it could do until the dealer demonstrated it. My Chevy had OnStar, which I liked a lot, but it didn't do all of these things. Wonderful leather in the King Ranch. Huge backseat area.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>my first new vehice! beautiful. the big 3 sure make their trucks well. excellent fit and finish. great ride, sync, crazy amounts of space. i see complaints about power on these f150s however the truck gets along just fine for me (4.6 3v). if you want a sport truck you may be dissappointed, but youre the average joe that goes from a to b and needs maybe some passing power for the highway will do just fine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded a GMC for the new Ford Platnium. This truck has the style of european road sedan and tough truck features you need also. I have been impressed with the new F150. It pulls a boat and trailer like its not even there and the large backseat makes it nice for 3 large adults to sit.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Only have 2000 miles on the truck but so far we love it, power is adequate, 6sp trans is great, mpg is 17, brakes have good feel and stop well, steering is responsive. The GPS and Senc are a wonder of technology. The heated and cooled seats are feature I will buy in all future cars/trucks. The new larger front doors make ingress and egress easier. With all the room in the back seat it seems like Ford could have done better with the rear seats. We looked at Dodge's new truck and it was a close call but who knows if Dodge will make it, Ford seems sounder. Speaking of sound the Ford is quieter than my BMW. I am impressed at the value and quality Ford offered. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats, GPS, Senc, power, trans, value and quality. I traded in a Ford f350 diesel 4wd and was surprised at how well the truck had held it's value. Quiet and ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I can't say enough good things about this truck. I love it. I parked it next to my friends 05 FX4 and mine was about 3 inches taller. This is a beefy truck. As big as it is, I get great gas mileage. I plan to install a K&N intake which should up my mileage another 10% or so. I took all of the truck leaders for a test drive, some had more flashy interiors and some had a softer ride, but Ford offered the best overall mix of refinement, capability, and fun. For the money, there is nothing better. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Beyond the beautiful re-designed interior and exterior, this truck rides like a Cadillac. The inside is huge with it's extra 6" they've added to to the cab. Much more space that my Escape. It looks burly, and it hauls. I haven't towed anything yet but I look forward to it. I can tell this thing is a beast but is easy on gas considering the size of it. I look forward to years of ownership on this baby. I seriously love it</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned Chevy, Dodge, and this is my third Ford. This is the finest truck ever owned. I am 6 ft 3 and over 300 lbs and this is the most comfortable vehicle ever owned. Great handling and ride. Good looking vehicle also. Ford really did it on this one. My wife who doesn't care for trucks comments on how quiet it is in the cabin at highway speeds. Love this truck</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ok well I wrote a review 12-6-08 see wow! And now I have 11,400 miles and still love it!! I have been driving quite frequently out to Ohio for work (that's the reson for high mileage) and I am averaging 17.3 with that 5.4 and 6 speed, the best powertrain combo. My friend's 5.7 Tundra does not "control" the trailer the way my truck does. Aside from a Super Duty, no other trucks pulls as smartly as this one does. I cannot say enough about the brakes and the handling and ride quality. It is as solid and bank vault like as my mom's 07 S-Class. I still have my 05 FX-4 with 90,000 miles and It rocks, not one problem, issue, or hiccup from it. This one will be as great because it is a Ford!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything! Sony sound, navigation, mega space inside, fuel economy. Best looking truck on the road! Tows like a champ, handles great, stops awesome.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am a woman who likes trucks, so I just bought a 09 F150. I was shocked at the redesigned interior, they actually put an in dash ashtray and lighter back into an American made vehicle. I am a heavy smoker, and use my vehicle for my business everyday. It beats having to use a small cup for putting out my cigarettes. Thanks Ford.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fun to drive. Quick from the start. Stylish to be in. Averaging about 18 mpg. Interior is great. I love the way the seats feel with the KR leather. The back seat is much more comfortable than prior models. I love the extra 6" in the rear seat. The front seat even has more room for taller drivers. Nav is neat and the back up camera is great. Love the pickup bed step and the tailgate step. 6.5 foot bed is harder to park but that is to be expected. Still haven't figured out how to work the electronics, but I'm t rying. Cup holder in the door is good idea. Love the big gas tank. Wow, what else can I say? Not only do I love this truck, but my wife and kids do to. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Back up camera and reverse sensors (safety). Seat comfort and design. Feels like your in a Super Duty but it is not as big and bulky. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Based on the deals out there due to the current market, i took advantage and swapped out my 2004 F1-150 for a new 2009. As another reviewer had mentioned; any and everything that you would have like to have seen changed on the the 2004 was! The interior is outstanding in every way. The new flat floor and fold up backseats are a great idea. Overall performance, engine, braking etc. I can't say enough about it. After 1,000 miles now, the only thing i haven't quite seen is the improved mileage. I'm still under 16 MPG highway, about the same as my old 5.4.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this truck 2 weeks ago, so far it has 1100 miles on it. It handles like a dream has plenty of power, pulls my landscape trailer like nothing. Interior is roomy and comfortable. I been averaging 19-21 on the highway. Has a nice ride on road and off road, very quiet when running 75mhp on the highway. Overall best bang for the buck. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am an F-150 man all the way. I still have my 05 FX-4, now with 84,000 miles, and it has been great, not one issue what so-ever. I tow horse trailers on the regular, and I have already towed horses with this new one, and it is just plain phenomenal. I love it. Everything that was great about the 05 is even greater in the 09, and the very few things I would have changed in the 05, they did so in the 09. The 5.4 is still no racer, but linked to the 6 auto trans, this thing tows 8000 pounds plus thru the mountains so easily. I didn't think they could have improved on the 04 redesign this much but leave it to Ford to make such a great truck. All their vehicles should be this great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Awesome Sony sound Sync and nav system. So comfortable. Driving to Virginia so easy with the beautiful interior. The FX-4 rocks...handles awesome, brakes incredible, trailer sway control, airbags everywhere, so many amenities, 6 auto trans, crew cab space with 6.5 ft bed. I can't say enough!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Second F150, first was a 5.4 that I put 170000.00 on. Well now they made it even better! A little more juice from the 5.4 and the 6 speed is a doll and you feel like the truck knows you, and the seats are more comfortable, they werent bad before! Yea others may have more power but they dont have the low end grunt, this beast is a pleasure to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great stereo, great supple ride, great towing, great heat, head turner, great for when I go to the cabin in southern Kentucky at Lake Cumberland. great for a commute to work, nice and comfy. What more could a guy want? </FAVORITE>
