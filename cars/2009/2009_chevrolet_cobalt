<TEXT>I've had my Yellow XFE coupe for about 4 months and 10,000 miles. I commute about 120 miles per day and average 38.5 and 39.1 MPG...you have to love that! The car is very comfortable and has great pickup when it's time to hit the on ramps. I was about to buy a civic, but saved myself 6 grand and get better mileage. I expect it will be a great car for years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked at several different makes, toyota lost out quick due to price and quality, Honda was impressive as was the price. Drove the Cobalt several times, loved the car over all, drive train sold me. After 6000 miles of driving I still love to get in and go. Gas mileage is amazing, trunk opening is small.Interior is OK, what can you expect for the price,Fur. It is durable and should last. I'm Happy and its made in the good old USA</TEXT>

<TEXT> With just over 2200 miles, I'm noticing the MPG going up.. average has gone from 31 to 35. Acceleration is a real kick, and with the windows now tinted black, this little white coupe looks even sharper. A/C works like a champ, and cools the car in about a minute with fan speed initially set at 3. From there it drops to 1, or it's too cold.. and we're talking So. Ariz. The engine runs cool.. about 195 in the heat of the day. The ride is great, and was complimented by a friend who drives a Volvo. I love this car, and as an old motor head, I rate it right at the top with some of my past hot rods and trucks, even my Sentra. Killer mileage, and it doesn't get hot. What a relief. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Company I work for bought four new 2009 Lt cobalt and each has had the steering column replaced at about 7k to 10k miles. The powering steering stops working making turning into parking spots (repetitively very hard). The steering wheel itself just does weird stuff and then the car needs repair. Other little things stop working too. Like the light showing what gear in, does not work. The head rest is in a awkward position too. Many people that sit in the seat immediately notice the head rest hitting their head in an odd way. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Car is engaging, it communicates through the steering wheel, suspension and exhaust sound. It does not attract attention, the interior does not communicate (steering wheel blocks freeway speeds and generally no useful notification system, trust onStar). Step on the throttle and it accelerates very quickly, no 'bad boy' behavior, just the rush. On curves, following instinct only, the posted speed limit is generally exceeded (significantly). As a passenger, it is a Chevy Cobalt. It's not a great family car, except that everyone in the family wants to drive it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering, suspension and acceleration are world class. The brakes inspire confidence.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned Toyotas for the past 12 years and I thought I would give an American Car a try. The Cobalt ride is great and the interior noise is super quiet for a small car. I am not impressed with the interior quality but I think the car has nice exterior lines. Gas mileage for city highway is right around 29 MPG... This car can accelerate! If this car is reliable I will continue to buy American. Overall a nice little car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car had surprising acceleration for its class. The car was also extremely quiet and had low road noise. The feedback in the steering is adequate at best. The braking is good and the gas mileage is acceptable. I averaged 29 MPG in hard mixed driving. I could get 35 MPG if this were not a rental and I did not pound it. I don't like the interior materials, but it is sufficient for most people. I also wish the car had on wheel audio controls. This is a very simple, clean, and functional car if you do not need to use the back seat. I generally do not like GM, but this is a nice car for the right price. Better to rent this than to own IMHO. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seats are fairly good. The seats are fairly comfortable. I am a big guy (5,11" 270) and had a surprising amount of room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the SS sedan 3 weeks ago. This car is a blast to drive! Have 2500 miles on it already. 3000 pound curb weight and 260hp is a great combo. Turbo-charged ecotec engine is fantastic. Exhaust has a nice rumble on hard acceleration, but it's not tiresome on the highway. Tires, wheels, steering, braking and suspension/handling are all top notch, simply outstanding. This car can really perform and it is so much fun to drive. Seats are amazing. I would recommend this ride to anyone who needs a double extra dose of performance in their daily drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I would never have considered the cobalt prior to driving it as a rental. I was impressed by the headroom, handling, and quiet firm ride when on a parkway at speeds 60+ I also felt the seats were very comfortable and supportive and the car was overall "fun to drive". I would definitely consider purchasing this car particularly in view of their competitive pricing</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first vehicle I have purchased on my own, and I am very happy with it. I wanted something simple, but my dealer located a car for me with the sports package, a lot of fun extras. I traded in my old Chevy Blazer for a more fuel efficient and safer car, and I am so glad I did. About a month and half after I purchased my car someone ran a red light and t-boned me. Both myself and my passenger were ok, and I credit that to my car. The time that my car was in the shop, I missed it. Before buying my car I test drove Honda's and Ford's, but with this car you get a lot of "bang for your buck": power, safety, fuel efficiency, comfort, etc. I think I made a very smart (and safe!) choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT> Compared to the old Sentra, this thing rocks, until you talk interior. The lack in braking with the LRR tires is also a bit of a drag. Got the XFE, and on the highway, it's getting an amazing 44 mpg. Overall I couldn't be happier. I love this car. Thank you GM for not going hybrid, and for building an affordable little mileage monster. I'm also way happy with what the base model comes with. Crank windows, manual seats.. no biggy. I love the DIC, and the stereo is great. While shopping, I saw others that wanted 3K for A/C, and used an idiot light as a temp gauge. Had no where near the gidup, and I seriously doubt they could match the MPG. Also used a timing belt.. I'll take a chain anyday.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving a Fit, Yaris, Soul, G5, and a Focus, the only thing left out there after week one of cash for clunkers were manual Cobalts. It compared well with the other models and got better fuel economy (posted). The G5 had more features for the price, but they were the first cars gone by day 4. The Cobalt doesn't have all the features of the other vehicle, but it does have a trip computer, On Star and XM radio. With rebates, the price was 12,500 before my 4,500 cash for clunkers taking the price to 8,100. I can live with what it doesn't have for that kind of money. Time will tell and I will follow up with future post as we observe real world mileage and wear and tear.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What can I say - I bought a 2005 because I needed a car (my '92 Lumina Van croaked at 218000 miles). There was nothing wrong with the '05 but GMAC wanted to get rid of their leases and they made me a good deal! The '09 feels like it has a little more power and is a bit more solid overall than the '05. Never had a problem with either car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new cobalt! The vehicle was much better than I initally thought. My Cobalt is fully loaded with Black leather interior, Premium Pioneer sound system (with a sub!),heated seats, Onstar, Bluetooth, HUGE sunroof. I like the fact that my Chevy makes it easy to keep your car up on maintenance as well. I know my tire pressure, coolant levels, oil level, gas mileage and more. I never paid attention to that stuff before, I always had my husband take care of it. The trunk is also very big. We are very Pleased with our purchase!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 8 speaker stereo, my doors automatically lock when I shift out of park, the gas mileage is AWESOME, it appears to be small on the outside but it's very roomy inside. The nice all black leather interior. Sunroof is very nice. Did I mention my stereo? </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car in November of 2008, it was the cheapest car I could find and I am surprisingly pleased with it. The drive is smooth and unexciting, the radio is decent enough, the controls are laid out nicely the front seat are comfortable enough to be in for a few hours at a time and it's a compact car that has enough power to pass semi's on the highway.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>High way gas mileage is great, I drove 265 miles on 7 gallons of gas. The front seats are great for tall adults. The trunk has folding supports so you can take full advantage of the ample trunk room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle drives very well, makes tight turns, responds quickly. The fit and finish is great, with no uneven gaps between body panels. The fuel economy is better than posted. I drive a mix of local roads and highway, and get about 32 MPG on average (with automatic transmission). The rear seats have ample leg rooms for my 2 teenage sons. Transmission is especially smooth. Never feel anything with gear changes. The vehicle has substantial weight, so on highway it does not "drift". A great value! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1.Manual driver seat height adjuster is convenient and enough to put me on a comfortable driving position. 2.Fuel economy better than posted. 3. Standard has sealant pump instead of spare-tire. This reduces mass of vehicle for better fuel economy, and still provides emergency help for a flat tire. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I picked up a Cobalt SS Sedan to compliment the 01 Z28 and 06 TrailBlazer SS that I own. I have to say that I am totally impressed with the Cobalt SS. What a surprising car! If I had not seen on at my local track I would never have given owning one a thought. The handling of these cars is second to none. You forget you are in a FWD vehicle. Straight acceleration is a blast and you don't realize how fast you are going due to how stable the car is at speed. Gas mileage is great. With the cruise on at 55 I'm getting 30+ MPG. City I'm getting mid twenties.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For the past two months I have been happy to get into my 2009 Chevy Cobalt and drive. There are three things that have impressed me about this car the most, and they are the quietness of the cabin, the strength of the engine at 155 HP and the transmission, being how smooth it is and quiet. There is little to no wind noise at 80 MPH, the engine really responds well and has great passing power when you need it. And the transmission is so smooth whether you are going up or down hills or just cruising on the freeway. The base sound system is great and the steering wheel radio controls make it easy to control when driving. There is plenty of cabins space for a two door. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I did not test drive other brands, so I don't know how this one would compare but with gm rebates/incentives it's a good buy, good acceleration, good ride and fairly quiet, with auto trans. getting around 29 mpg combined city/hwy, poor rear vis. in the coupe version, esp with spoiler, so far with 5K mi., no reliability issues, check with your insurance co. re: premiums, may be higher than you expect, esp. for the 2 door version.. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car less than a week and I love it. Engine power is great and the handling is very tight.Very good brakes. the sound system is very good also. Things that I don't like. Small fuel tank, only 13 gal and the fuel economy isn't that great but I hope that it will better after being broke in. Chevrolet needs to redesign the interior. To much cheep looking plastic. Also after I got my car home I discovered that the underhood liner was missing! Now this car went through at least half a dozen quality control people plus the dealership new car PDI and no one caught it! How the dealership handles this problem is yet to be seen.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased my new 2009 Cobalt XFE sedan. I have not seen many of the XFE packaged cars in the sedan bodystyle, so I assume that it is pretty rare. My car is the very base model LS, and the only option I purchased was floormats. It is a very comfortable driving car. It is surprisingly quiet inside (I've been told the sedan version has more headroom and is slightly quieter if that sways your decision). The engine power is great. I have 700 miles on the car and got an average of 40.7 MPG!!! That was on a 60 mile round trip of windy country roads and getting stuck in a little traffic. The mileage amazes me!</TEXT>

The extras I get with this car, XM radio, ONStar, hands free phone and the price, I just could not say no.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'd been eyeballing the SS Cobalt when it was supercharged. However, instead of purchasing it, I bought a 2007 Subaru Forester, XLT. (turbocharged) I turned 50 and decided it was time for my midlife crisis car. So, I added the 2009 Cobalt SS Turbocharged to my stable. I use my SS Cobalt as a commuter vehicle. Part of my commute is on a narrow winding road perched on the side of a canyon. The car is amazing on that road and I look forward to the drive. After the 14 miles of twisting road, everything else is boring. The car has an excellent ride. Oddly enough, the car rides better than the Subaru. I get a combined 28.5 mpg with the car and I don't drive conservatively.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently traded my 2003 Ford Explorer for the 2009 Chevy Cobalt LT XFE 4-door sedan, in sport red, with a manual 5 speed transmission. I love the way this car rides and handles. I especially love the mpg this car gets, I travel 40+miles, six days a week, and I'm averaging 29.9 mpg. Compared to my Explorer, this is like getting gas for half price. Considering this is a compact car, it is extremely roomy, with quite a large trunk. I can't believe how quietly this car travels, with no road noise to be heard. The OnStar is a plus also. Great car for the price. I love it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at a few different cars in this class and ended up buying a great Cobalt XFE. The interior door panels are in need of new materials and and a better design. The Chrome door handle and storage are great but the Plastic is so rough you can grate cheese on it. That is the only dislike however about this great car. I looked at an 09 Corolla and that interior looked extremely cheap and was full of bad plastics & poor fitting panels. The cost of the Corolla 5 speed was 14,500 rock bottom price. The Cobalt with all the same equipment plus onstar and XM radio was $11,000 before tax. PLUS the Cobalt is getting 39 mpg in mixed driving &ts not even broken yet. The Cobalt is the way to go.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Only had car for a few weeks, so I will write another review in a year. I may not know much about this car yet, but I do know that the gas mileage is fabulous. Better than any 4 cylinder compact car I have owned. However, that only goes for the manual transmission LS models. The manual transmission is fun to drive, it shifts smoothly and the engine is peppy. Great if you need to pass someone. The trunk is roomy but the back seats are not. Overall I do like this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>In 2008 I purchased a 2007 Chevrolet Aveo. Never-again. I had it into the shop 15+ times in a single year. I swore I'd never buy another GM car until I laid eyes on the 2009 Chevrolet Cobalt LS Coupe. I was drawn by it's style and yellow color. After test driving it and looking at the specs, my boyfriend and I decided we'd give GM another try. WONDERFUL, idea. I love its get-up-and-go power and handling. XM is awesome as is 1 free year of Onstar. This car has been completely reliable and I enjoy driving it. The price was reasonable, and the fuel economy is excellent. At 20 miles on the odometer when I first purchased the car I was getting 30mpg and it's still going up. Great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The first flaw I noticed with this car was that there is a severe premium on storage space. My map book wouldn't even fit in the glove compartment! The (optional) arm rest storage compartment is a must-have, even though it interferes with the parking brake. I found that the seat belt latch was located a little too close to the body and therefore difficult to access. The seats themselves are comfortable enough and there is more than enough head and leg room (I'm 6'). The display module is located a little too low on the dash. I found that it was obscured by the steering wheel spokes while turning so that the "low traction" warning couldn't be seen if you were turning on a patch of ice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I have to admit, this is a pretty sharp looking car in profile view. The stereo system isn't bad and is easy to manipulate while driving. Fuel economy is fantastic. Lots of room in the trunk. 60/40 split seats is a nice touch. Aluminum wheels and power package are nice features for the price.</FAVORITE>

One free year of OnStar and 3 free months of XM radio really sweeten an already good deal. My friend is a real snob about cars and hates American cars. After showing him a lot of SS reviews and giving him a ride in my new car he has had to admit this is a good car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my SS Cobalt without driving one as every state west of the Mississipi had only 5 SS'. I ordered one after reading my Road and Track, Motor Trend Mag's and going around the Nurmburing's track with a professional driver in the rain no less. Lap times just above 8 minutes, and the driver expressed great impressions of what the car is able to do. Seeing as how I want to do what I can to help the economy and own a true muscle car matching the numbers of a Buick GS 455, and getting 2 to 3 times the mileage I bought one. I have 4500 miles on the car, perfect seats that my 90 year old mother could actually not have pain after 8 hours in the passenger seat, and scarry fast, like-Corvette</TEXT>

The OnStar and XM are my favorite features plus the XFE sticker on the trunk is cool even though I'm not sure what it means. I assume it is the sport package? At 6'4 and 330 lbs I fit very comfortably and dont feel cramped like I was in the mustang. I drive 100 miles to college and then 20 to work. so the gas mileage is very important.

<TEXT>So far I love this car. Fun to drive, sharp looking and excellent fuel economy. I purchased the LT 2 door coupe with the automatic. Plenty of power for regular driving and the interstates. Passing power is more then good enough. I am getting lots of compliments on the style of the car. I got a black one with the 16" rims and spoiler and chrome package. Lots of heads turn to take a look as I am driving. Rides and handles very nicely. It looks and drives great. I am very, very happy. No problems at all after the first 2 months. For the money it's an excellent car to buy. I am more then pleased. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style and the fun of driving a sporty small car again after driving an SUV for several years. Excellent gas mileage. The auto start and the XM radio are great features. Base radio has an excellent sound. Trunk space is very large for a small car. I am 6 feet tall and front seat leg room is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I also bought "Go"balt during the GM employee price period. Nice incentive to get what turns out to be just about everything I hoped for, even the color I wanted - yellow. Great handling. Only 1600 miles but getting 27.2 mpg last check. Work ride between 40-50 mph at 60 miles each day. Would've liked hatchback. Rear deck just in the way & to hold speakers. Rear spoiler can block vision. I'm 6'-1"+ & seat is comfortable but I must cock my knees just so on entry. Interior a little chintzy but hey, it's a commuter car with go-power. The refig display is different. I have trouble reading it in the variety of color combos it offers. Currently getting dealer installed cat- back system. A kid at 58!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the Cobalt SS Sept 15. So far I?m very impressed. The turbo really helps the 2.0 liter create power. It feels faster, stops quicker and handles better than my 96 TransAm WS6 (and it was a performer in its day). The reconfigurable display is awesome, the Brembos fell like an anchor is thrown out to help stop it and it handles like its on rails. The seats feel great, standard bluetooth is cool and the short-throw shifter is outstanding. I've had Vettes, TransAms, and tons of 60's era muscle cars. At 54 years old, this car puts a smile on my face every time I drive it. With the GMPP plan offered last month, I?m sorry I didn?t buy two of them for $22,400.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's a small car! Handles beautifully, the Ecotrac whines a bit more than I like, but I love it! Having a compartment that is more easily accessed by the driver, yet secure would be helpful. the 'tray' under the Emerg brake doesn't 'corral' things well and they end up on the floor (not safe for drivers to fetch). XM may be a keeper and I feel much safer with the OnStar...some people may feel it's 'big brotherish but if big brother wants to keep tabs on my grocery store runs...he can help load and unload them! ....the dishwasher too! ...can drive me to work too!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar! Extra charging outlet, no cigarette lighter! Spacious trunk for a small car! Autostart rocks!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Really surprized with this car. I needed an inexpensive car to drive to and from work. The gas mileage is unbeatable, it is averaging 39 mpg. I really like the 5 speed. It has plenty of power. This is a much better car than the Corolla I was looking at and a lot cheaper.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The driver's seat is very comfortable, the car drives good, rides good, and wind and road noise is minimal. The fuel economy is very good. The right rear speaker is defective, a new one has been ordered. One negative design flaw is that the arm-rest between the driver and front passenger seats has to be raised up in order to set or release the parking brake. A telescoping steering wheel would be greatly appreciated by long legged drivers such as myselg.</TEXT>
