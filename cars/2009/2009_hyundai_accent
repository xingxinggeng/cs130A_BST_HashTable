<TEXT>I must admit i was a little skeptical about Hyundai at first. However, my dads 2004 elantra has 270,000 miles on it before the oil pump went and blew the engine. That said i decided for my job to get a el cheapo accent base, no ac, no radio (i installed one myself), and a 5 sp manual tranny. I only paid after tax title license $11,325 with a 20 yr powertrain warranty, yes a 20 yr, from Rick Case. I average 33-41 MPG per tank. Clutch is smooth, drivability is fun, and the best part of it is the price. I have 12000 miles on this car with no issues. I cant say enough about this little fun car, except I highly recommend this vehicle!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel Economy,easy to park,easy to maintain. Overall the best bang for the buck. It is also one less part to break. I use Mobile 1 OW-20 oil, with a Napa Gold filter and I change the oil every 7500 miles.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Accent SE six weeks ago and have put 1900 miles on it since. I was looking for efficiency, reliabiltiy, cargo space, and a little bit of cuteness. I got all of that plus ABS, cruise, a decent stereo system with 3 months of XM included, a sunroof, and reasonably comfy seats. As to be expectied, it's not monstrously powerful, but I can merge onto the freeway or climb a hill comfortably, albeit a bit noisily. When not laboring in one of those situations, the engine runs quietly and smoothly. It corners well, stops well and doesn't feel too mushy. I would have preferred an MT, but the AT was in stock so I went for it. Interior is laid out logically. Overall, a good value.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>armrest on driver side, lighted vanity mirrors, extra compartments for sunglasses and stuff, low tire sensor, tilt steering, actual spare TIRE, sunroof, foglights, shiny paint. it's a very cute car - the low pro tires and wheels aren't bad. i really love the apple green color. i call it 'the pod'.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I can't really believe the gas we're getting! When the wife drives it she's getting 33-35 mpg in town! I get over 30. I was totally surprised when on a trip to Oregon, We averaged 39.8 mpg!! The car has all the warranty and with the factory rebate we only paid 12k. The wife and I couldn't be happier!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage and fun to drive, oh and turning radius. A real pleasure to park!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my Accent primarily for daily commute duties. I have put about 1000 miles on car so far and it has been a pleasure to drive. The soft suspension provides a comfortable ride. Wind, suspension and engine noise are well controlled. The 1.6L engine and automatic transmission provide adequate power for my needs. The interior is roomy for the car size and looks nice for an economy car. Gas mileage is ~26 mpg with only in town driving and 40+ mpg with pure freeway driving. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage is good. Interior layout is simple. Smooth ride and quiet at cruise speeds. Radio has XM service. Arm rest. Additional recline position for rear seat back(s). After unlocking power door locks with remote the doors will relock after ~1 minute if you do not open a door.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Could not be more happier buying this car. Its very sturdy and holds very well on freeway about 70-80mph. Drives very well within city too. get about 28mpg within city and 30-32 mpg on highway (mostly because of no cruise control). Excellent second car to have. Very spacious too, can easily fit 4 people.</TEXT>

<TEXT>got this car with the C4C (cash for clunkers) $4500 that I got for my 1998 Isuzu Rodeo. What a deal! This car is great for the money spent. LOVE the way it handles and I get 33mpg in mixed city/hwy driving. Can't beat that. Odd mix of features - has power windows, power locks, low tire pressure indicator, six airbags but no cruise control! Overall I can't complain - the warranty is great, too. Take a serious look at this car especially if you're doing the C4C deal.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got the vehicle yesterday and put almost 200 miles on it the first day. Traded in a piece of trash and got $4500 from Cash for Clunkers and $1500 Factory Incentive. Sticker price was $16,184 (Dealer added $299 for tint) and I paid $9,060 (plus tax, title & license). For $9,000 you can't beat it. It's not fast off the line, but once you get going, it goes great. It was almost hard to keep it at 75 on the freeway as it drove effortlessly at 80 and 85. A 6 foot driver and 2 6 foot passengers in the back all had enough room, although the seats are not as soft and comfortable as a more expensive model. You can't go wrong with this car if you can pick it up cheap.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car for nothing more than fuel economy. I took a real leap of faith in that I only saw a picture because the dealer had none in inventory, also never test drove the car. When I picked it up it was more than I imagined, it had a great look both exterior and the interior was much better than I thought it would be. Seats and int. Color is beautiful stereo is fantastic XM is fantastic (3 months free ) car drives very well handles nicely and all for 8 out the door. Car has a desert pkg and all floor matsonly complaint is dealership refused to give the $1.49 gas deal. This is a definate surprise never expected this car to be this good. Keep thinking they delivered wrong car</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been looking at small cars for a year and ended up with the accent. I went from a Yukon to this and love it. The front is just as roomy as my Yukon was and it is a lot more fun to drive. The mpg is fantastic and it looks good too. Going up steep hills can take some patients but it is a small 4 banger so what do you expect? for the money, it is a great buy and Hyundai is what Toyota used to be. You cant go wrong. Not a lot of extra features, but I knew that going into it. It is even easy to drive on the interstate with it. I have not owned it that long, but I like it more and more every day.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the Hyundai Accent! Needed a new car after wearing out a very good Subaru but did not want to pay the high price for another Subaru. Looked at Hyundai since they are affordable and reliable. Liked the styling of the Accent hatchback and the fact that it did not come with a bunch of gadgets that will eventually break. Test drove and immediately knew this was the car for me. Though not a Ferarri with acceleration it gets to speed well enough. The car is quiet and rides very well. You get a little suspension noise over large bumps but the ride is very stable. Get the A/C - it is nice and cold. Controls are well laid out and easy to reach. Surprisingly very roomy for a small car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roominess, CD player with 3 months free XM (what a deal), ride and comfort. Ease of finding serviceable items under the hood. Overall design of car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I didn't even want a new car, but when the government came out with it's new middle-class welfare program (Cash for Clunkers) I said what the heck, I'll go spend some of my own tax dollars. I wanted a cheap, cheap car and thought of the Hyundai's, Kia's, etc. The Honda's and Toyota's were still too pricey for me even after the 4500 cash. Well, I came across the Hyundai Accent GLS and that was it. This car is nice, not cheap. I'm 6'4 and I fit just fine. Get one w/o a radio and install your own, all the wiring/speakers are already installed. Took me 20 minutes to put a great radio in. Keep up w/ the maintenance and the warranty won't let you down. GO BUY ONE, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been driving large cars all my life but being retired I needed to save on gas. What a car, this little Accent drives great, has head room for my cowboy hat, accessory holders, great radio/CD player, goes around curves like a BMW, less noise interior than my old caddy, drives by gas stations on trips, we love our light green color, air conditioning cold as ice, leg room for my 6'1" 250 lbs and comfortable in drivers seat, Took my granddaughter to lunch and she had plenty of room in rear seat next to the groceries and half dropped back seat. What a bargain for the price. As you can see we love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>What a fun, comfortable, drivable car! Lots of room for the driver and front passenger. The radio (XM) and CD are way beyond anything expected. Handles well, responds surefootedly, and peppy. Used the gov't. "Cash for Clunkers" program ($4,500) and a $1,500 dealer rebate, which covered half of the vehicle cost (before state sales tax and transportation). You will love the car even more when gas goes back up to $4.00 or more per gallon. Go get one today.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car for your dollars! Not only does it look good but it is fun and easy to drive. Has most everything you'll need and the automatic transmission is a nice change from having to shift in traffic. Corners easily, good performance all the way around. Plenty of room front and back. Controls easy to reach and operate. I cannot find anything that I don't like about this vehicle! I compared two other vehicles in the same class and in the end the Accent won out. The GS 2 door hatch back with the auto trans/ac package is a great buy. Compare it and you'll see! Had a very minor issue with a 'rattle', and the dealer took care of it quickly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I needed second car, so we decided to buy something small and fuel efficient. So the most important for me was fuel economy, I did not care about others "comforts". So after two months I have to admit economy is good, when I am not speeding (average 50 mph) accent is doing about 37 mpg! I read editors review here on Edmunds and I knew that accent does not belong to demons of speed, but I am fine with this. So car let say is ok, worth money I gave, but I would do more improvements: 1) put smaller engine (1.4l) so they will beat Toyota in fuel efficiency 2) I do not really like in this car gear stick is not smooth and is hard to change gear, Hyundai schould work on this in manuals.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We test drove several other popular cars and didn't expect the Accent to be the one we choose, but one test drive and we were sold. We wanted a fuel efficient car that would last well beyond the payments and this one was certainly a consideration for us. We wanted a car that was quiet and comfortable to drive. With a seat height that is higher than the competition's and very surprisingly fun to drive handling characteristics, this was the one liked the most. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The audio in this car sounds better than all others in it's class and that's a bonus for me because music is big part of my life style. We also enjoy the popular equipment package it came with.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only had the car for 8 days, but I am totally in love with it.....more so than any car I've owned. Funny thing was, I didn't expect to be. I figured it was a nice looking, decent fuel economy and great warranty. I was stunned when the car arrived at the dealership. It was way more beautiful than the internet pics, and the interior seemed upscale in rich, textured black. The car itself is Ebony Black. I love the 16 inch alloy rims, satellite radio, and the B&m short-shifter. I assumed this car would be a yawn to drive. Wrong again. It has snappy acceleration, and is grippy through the turns. I am totally happy with my choice, and grin every time I sit in this cute car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought this 2009 accent and I could not be happier. This car is not my primary vehicle, its just a around town vehicle and for my 17yr old son to use to school and work. The outside body design makes it look like a more expensive vehicle. I was also surprised by the get up and go from the 1.6L engine. I'm 6-4 and have plenty of head room. I do have to put the seat all the way back and tilt the back, but over all I feel comfortable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is fun to drive you can zip around in parking lots and it fits anywhere. There is lots of room, I am a large guy and I fit in her fine. It rides Nice on the road, very smooth. I think they could of put a little more sound deafening inside the fenders and rear quarters. There is a little road noise. All in all this car is cool. Try it I think you will like it.</TEXT>
