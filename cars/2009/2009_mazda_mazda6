<TEXT>Gauges too high...when you have wheel tilted and seat adjusted normally, wheel blocks gauges. Some small trim defects, misaligned panels, etc. Wind whistle. Good mpg, nice suspension. Feels bigger than it is to drive, backing up a chore. Compliments from others on styling. Standard DSC a plus. Transmission can be felt downshifting hard when decelerating which is annoying. Very quiet at highway speed. Nice interior layout with exception of gauges vs. steering wheel. Too much bass at low volumes--stereo. Nice, roomy rear seat. Plastic wheel covers hard to clean (brake dust). Enormous trunk--very nice. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering accuracy. Trunk space. Very low wind noise. Dash design aside from gauge pod placement. Standard stability control. Looks not too boring like a Camry, not as weird as Accord.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased on 7/26/09, so I have owned the car for just over 2 months. This car provides luxury features, fun driving, and very good fuel economy at a reasonable price. I have a 50 mile round trip commute that is mostly highway. At 65-70 mph, I average 28-30 mpg. I think it could do even better if it was geared a bit higher. The gear ratios in the 6M are a bit close. I usually skip 3rd and 5th gears. The engine has plenty of torque to handle the short shifting. The engine really comes alive above 3,500 RPM. The car rides extremely well and handles well...a great balance. It is a bit noisy over rough pavement, but so is every car in this price range. Overall, I am very pleased.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Electronic entry and keyless ignition. Memory seats. Automatic Xenon headlights. Dash design. 6-speed manual transmission. Trunk size and fold-down seats...I throw my bike in with no trouble. Excellent rear seat room. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2009 Mazda6 in November of 08. I traded an 06 Mazda 6 V6. I never thought I would own a Mazda but after having owned two I am a loyal customer. The only problems thus far with the car is the stripping around my windshield just above the dash has melted from the Texas heat. I took the car into the dealership and the service manager informed me they would have to take my dash out to replace the stripping. He advised not to do this because it may have rattles in the dash after re-installing. I am questioning the A/C. It sometimes doesn't seem to cool properly. My previous 6 had A/C issues. Hope this one is not the same. All in all it is a very nice car for the price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love this car! Have been driving since April and it is now mid September. I can't tell you how many times I am stopped by people who ask about my car. Not only does it look sweet, it drives like a dream - very smooth and fun! Best part is the roomy interior. I have two very tall teenagers who sit comfortably in the back as well as a very large trunk space. The 12 speaker Bose sound system sounds very good as well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I have the dual tone interior of tan and black and it look amazingly sharp. The seat is extremely comfortable and I love the dash and controls. Everything is logical and easy to use. I also love the ability to control my stereo from the steering wheel. The ride is wonderfully smooth. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second mazda6, I bought the four cyl one last December. I love this car sooo much I had to have the v6 model. Now I have 2. Fantastic vehicle. Hands down blows away the Nissan altima/Honda accord/and Camry. For the money this is the best car around. The competition dollar for dollar is blown away. You gotta test drive this car. Dealers eager to negotiate price. Great handling characteristics, so fun to drive!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Blind spot monitoring, Xenon Headlamps, Bose stereo, Bluetooth, love listening to the music on my Iphone wirelessly, love that feature. sync was a breeze.

<TEXT>Traded in my 2003 Protege for the new 6. I have never owned anything this nice before. It's such a "grown up" car, yet it retains that rebellious teenager behavior. I had the chance to drive a 2009 G37 and was blown away. The 6S GT gave me everything that G37 offered for about 12 grand less! No brainer! If Mazda keeps cranking out cars like this, I will be a customer for life!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy, stylish, luxurious interior. Creature comforts abound. Nothing on the road looks like it - except for other Mazdas. Very quick. Goes where you point it. ZoomZoom is all you can think about when you drive this car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has state-of-the-art features seen only in luxury cars. And it's not cheap/unreliable, everything has worked flawless (rainsense wipers with sensitivity setting, keyless entry, bluetooth, blind-spotmonitor, driver+passenger side temp ctrl, driver seat that memorizes each driver's setting based on key, ability to roll windows using remote fob, ability to close windows/sunroof from outside, awesome bose speakers, audio with DVR like rew/fwd to a previously played track (it has memory!), ability to fold rear seat with 60/40 split, fuel consumption monitor. mpg: The consumption monitor is great driving aid. Without it I avg 21, but after using it I avg 23 (becoming a better mpg driver!) </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>two charging outlets,ipod port,xenon lamps, auto dim mirror, heated side mirrors, dedicated front/rear defog buttons. Plus fun factor of driving the car (power, handling, smoothness, quietness). This one's a true winner!I feel it sets the benchmark that all sedans in this segment will have to try to beat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my car with the Bose/Moonroof package on 6th June '09. Have almost 5000 miles on it! (less than 3 months). Love driving this car around. Great mileage - combined EPA estimate is 24 mpg, I have regularly got over 26.5 mpg. On a really long trip I got 30.2 mpg. (All calculations based on full tank and trip meter) 170 hp makes it one of the most powerful car in it's category. Bose 10 speaker sound is awesome. Fog lights are nice. Good Michelin tires, but I think squeals a tad too much sometimes. I test drove the Toyota Camry, Nissan Altima, VW Passat and CC (liked the CC a lot, but 4 seater) - Mazda6 as a package, features and price, won hands down.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1. MPG - Consistently get over 26.5 mpg 2. Bose sound 3. Exterier, specially the accentuated front body over the tires, almost seems like a mucle car 4. Power 5. Trunk space 6. Keyless ignition 7. Twin mettalic exhaust </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has been great. I have received a lot of comments from young and old on how nice the car looks. I bought the car with the convenience package and love the BSM and the Xenon headlights. I can see the road at night! The seating is comfortable and am pleased with the design and layout of the interior. However, the mpg is a bit disappointing- I average 23 mpg combined (probably because of the way I drive). The performance is ok, there isn't really much of a zoom-zoom, probably because its a 4 cyl. To get up hills at a decent speed, I have to operate at 3500 rpm. One good thing though, the car accelerates pretty quickly. I usually end up leaving cars behind. It's a good car overall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought a 2007 Mazda5, then a 2009 Mazda5 for my wife. Now I wanted to spoil myself, and in addition to a big Ford 3/4 ton diesel pickup to tow our trailer, I wanted something nice, yet not as common and plain vanilla boring like a Honda or Toyota! The '09 Mazda6 is all new and a spectacular car, miles ahead of the competition on style, warranty and features...big value too. The Grand Touring S is near luxury, handles and performs with the class leaders, the fit and finish is world class, the pain job is layers deep and perfect. Incredible long non-copayment warranty is transferable includes a loan car when in for service. The interior is finished like an expensive business class car! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks of envy from people driving lesser cars, like Camry, Acord, VW, Hyundais! Certaunly looks, feels and performs like a car costing thousands more. World class! Bose Stereo system and navigator is icing on a perfect cake! Xenon headlights are a must, never saw so good or felt so safe at night</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had the car for over a month now. Pros: Excellent build quality, stylish interior and exterior, many cool features (Bluetooth, Blind spot monitoring, auxiliary jack, Info display, etc), smooth even at high speeds, fun to drive. Con: Biggest problem: Most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. If I drive longer than 20 minutes or so, my back and legs start hurting. I have tried every setting possible, without success. If comfort is important to you, stay away from the 6 (maybe GT model is better). </TEXT>

<TEXT>Shopped extensively before selecting the Mazda6 and so far I am very pleased. Compared Nissan, Chevy, Hyundai, Pontiac, Honda. For the features, performance, comfort, luxury, size, and styling, the 6 was hard to beat. Mostly mixed driving so far and mpg is holding steady at 24.5 mpg. I have to admit the power out of the 4 cyl is quite impressive. Am hoping for CAI and oil filter options to be available soon. Would highly recommend this car if you are in the market.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style, room, ride quality/quietness, features (int and ext), sound system. I am impressed with the layout of the engine - intake on the front, exhaust at the back, cooler air in, heat out the back with plenty of temp barrier on firewall. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well, after 5 years and 76000 trouble free miles we traded in our 2004 Mazda6s for the new 2009 Mazda Grand Touring. We've only had it 2 days but love it. Its as rock solid as our 04 but bigger, more comfortable and very powerful. We love the options like the navigation, Bluetooth, Bose system, Blind Spot Monitoring etc etc. It is much more comfortable than our old 6, but a bit bigger. Mazda managed to retain the sportiness and fun to drive aspect. I just hope it is as dependable as our 04 was. It was easy to return to Mazda, We've owned 5 Mazdas in the last 20 years and they have been great with no issues. We haven't had a bad one and look forward to our new long term test drive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been a Honda owner for the last 20 years. When it came time to trade in my CR-V, I was ready for a sedan. The Accord was nice, drove perfectly fine, and looked very elegant, but wasn't as exciting as the Mazda. The Accord just didn't have the "Zoom, Zoom." I had forgotten how much fun driving can be. Mazda's plan to compete with Honda for market share worked on this Honda owner. I've only had it for 1 week, but I love it more each day I drive it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the car for just about a month. City and highway drive is about 50/50 and have average mileage above 26 mpg (based on my calculation on 3 tank refills). Trunk is the largest in its class but the opening could be bigger. I have two children sit in back seat and seems rear windows are bit high for them to see outside. Ride is quiet and comfortable. The boss sound does its job nicely. The 6 speed manual transmission is very smooth and fun to shift. Blue tooth system is easy to use and very helpful. Blind spot monitor is a good feature but only works when speed is above 20 mph. lots of air bags and traction control and stability control are standard. Just love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Pros: one of the best looking cars on the road today, great features (mine is fully loaded, minus remote start), and an overall extremely fun ride. Cons: none, well, just wish Ford would have allowed cooled seats to be put into the 6.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easily the Xenons. The fact that you can pivot them up and down is awesome. While on the expressway, they are set for regular driving (3), where I live on the back roads, the setting is high (0). Have never gotten this good of sight from headlights before!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had the car for 3 weeks now, replacing an 05 Altima. I do both highway and city driving, and this car has a ride quality you would find in a larger sedan but with power and maneuverability when you want it. Where the Altima was harsh and noisy, the Mazda exudes confidence, handling all road surfaces with ease. From a style standpoint, you can't beat the aggressive stance and overall lines - borrowing cues from Lexus and Infiniti isn't such a bad thing, and the design is hands down nicer than Camry or Accord, and the "happy face" grille of the Altima. Fuel economy is about the same as the Altima - it's reasonable given the power and performance of the V6. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>There are a lot of great things about this car. Dashboard lighting and layout. Sound system. Xenon headlights. Dual zone climate control. Throaty exhaust note when you feel the need for some Zoom.</FAVORITE>

The mazda6 is elegant looking but handles like a sports car. Gas mileage is better than what the advertisement says. I get 21 in the city, 29 in the highway. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The handling, interior design, and decent fuel economy closed the deal for me. A recent drive from San Diego to Vegas at definite extra-legal speeds still gave me 30+ MPG up and over the mountain ranges. If I was inclined to drive at posted limits I'm certain this car will get 32-34 on the highway with a range over 510 miles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very competent handling for a wrong wheel drive sedan. The smart key, push button start, blind spot monitoring mirrors, and lighting features initially seemed gimmicky, but now, I love the convenience. I love the bluetooth audio feature, too bad my arrogant Apple iphone is too dumb to support it :( </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been driving a beat up 99 Ford Escort for the past 6 years and couldn't wait to get rid of it. I finally got my first job and within a few months was ready to make my purchase. I originally decided on an mx-5 Miata but once I saw the new 6, changed my mind. I just couldn't justify paying the price for the mx-5 when I could get a fully loaded 6 for less. Went to the dealership this morning and drove away with a gorgeous i touring with convenience package in comet gray. The color is stunning and the car is amazing. I paid 500 below invoice and drove away in a car that some have already mistaken for a Lexus. Couldn't be happier.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased an '09 6i Touring with the 6 CD changer & moonroof, along with a rear spoiler. My 2004 Mazda 3i was totaled so I wasn't in "car buying" mode, but I'm glad I stayed with Mazda. I went with the 4-cyl, which is starkly different than Edmund's review of the V6. The ride is very quiet, and I get good gas mileage (1600 mi, ~24mpg combined.) The acceleration is great, most noticeably between 50mph - 75mph, even in auto. The braking is excellent too. As nimble as my 3i was, I feel like the 6i has excellent handling for it's larger size. I've also fit 4 grown adults in the car, and they've all commented how much legroom they have. Mazda got it right again! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Keyless ignition! Steering wheel mounted radio controls, Bose system, much quieter moonroof than on my previous Mazda 3i, huge backseat, huge trunk, very fast rear-window defroster (hehe). Tiny compartment for key fob under front dash. 2 cigarette lighter plugs. Auto-dim rearview mirror.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I looked for the right combination of sportiness, fun to drive and family friendly for 2 years. The Honda Accord coupe appealed to me. The kids did not fare well in the back. Nissan was so arrogant they would not let me have a test drive without a deposit. I loved the mini. My tallest in class kids are not likely to fit in the back for long. Alas, sporty moms have an option. The kids love the new car. Their sports car crazed mom, who raced motorcycles, is happy too. It reminds me of my Honda S2000, with room for the kids. Who said moms are delegated to the slow lane? Cool mom, cool car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a loaded up Mazda6 for my wife to get her hands-free in heavy traffic. What can I say? This is a great looking, nice handling car that's has a decent ride and is relatively quiet. It really is very Lexus-like in many aspects. We drove this after driving comparable Altimas and Accords and this was the winner, hands down. This was the best combination of ride, handling and comfort by a wide margin. All the magazines may be raving about the new Accord, but this is the new class leader in my book.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched and test drove all competitive models before making my purchase. As soon as I drove the new Mazda6, I knew it was the one. The mix of power, sport, comfort, and styling is unmatched in the class. I drive a lot of miles per year and have already racked up 6K miles. I have been getting about 28 MPG on average, with a lot of those miles spent at 80 MPH on the interstate. My only complaint so far is the transmission. It seems to shift lazily at times, especially during 1-2-3 transition, and when coming to a stop you can actually feel the trans downshift. But overall, I have been very pleased with the car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the size of the interior and trunk. The styling has received much praise from friends and family. Fuel economy is good for a car of this size. Good power for a 4 cyl. engine. I enjoy the manual shift mode of the automatic transmission.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I LOVE THIS CAR!!!! Before I bought the Mazda 6 I looked at the Acura TSX, Lexus, and Saturn Aura. The Acura was too compact in my opinion, and the aura was not worth the price for what you get. I don't have many bad things to say about the Lexus ES other than the Mazda looks almost about the same inside and out. For the same price, I could have picked up a basic Lexus ES or get a souped up Mazda 6 with beautiful leather interior, terrific sound, comfort, and quality. Black exterior and blond Interior.

<TEXT>Owned many a Mazda - B2000, Miata(x2), MS3, M6 (2006) and now the 2009. I've never posted a review but thought this time I MUST. Every year Mazda just gets better and better, this current 2009 Mazda6 is the biggest bang for the buck BY FAR overall. Mine is the Mazda6I Grand Touring 4-cyl with the optional Moonroof & Bose Pkg. I owed 10k on my previous M6 & traded up for the new '09. I need to mention... 130,000 miles with not one single problem, just tires brakes. With that excessive mileage, the bluebook value had me under about 4 grand. Times are tough right now, so the dealer was kind enough to pay it off and not jack the MSRP price of the new, do the math 4$$$ shaved. Oh,BTW, 30MPG baby!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Performance wise this car has more than enough zip and agility to make any ride to the local grocery store a treat. On the highway the throttle is not as responsive as one might think and the hesitation of the automatic gear box will take a second or two to pick up. The lower profile Michelin tires are comfortable but bumps and ridges in the road can definitely be felt. The interior is probably what turns me on the most with great dashboard controls and information that is very useful. I love the miles remaining on tank display. BSM is a huge plus and a great safety feature. The info button is tough to get to while driving. In all this was one of my favorite decisions in a car.</TEXT>

Bose is great, keyless entry & pushbutton ignition cool! Trunk huge as is back seat. Handles like a sports car but ride is soft. 6 cylinder is powerful & quiet. Only have it a few weeks but very happy so far. Averaging 21 mpg in combined driving. Have an 05 Mazda 3 with 45,000 miles with no problems, hope this one is as reliable</TEXT>

<TEXT>After looking at other cars (Altima, Accord, TSX), I knew this was the car for me. Stylish design inside and out, awesome features that you can't find in several other mid-sized cars in this category, and an unmistakable zoom-zoom sports car attitude that no other car, cheaper or more expensive, can come close to touching. The 3.7 is the way to go with this car! For a little less fuel economy than that smaller engine, and a little more money, it's worth every penny to get the more powerful engine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased the Mazda 6 after driving a 1998 Lexus ES 300 for 9 years. I could not find a car that came close at all to the Lexus until now. The Mazda 6 is that car, it beats out all the other bland cars on the road to date. Everyone considering a sedan should consider test driving one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I totaled out my 07 Mazda CX-7 and fell in love with the 2009 6 after test driving one. I purchased an i touring and have no regrets with the 4 cyl. The styling of this car is amazing. The car has been mistaken for a Lexus three times. This is the best car I have ever driven. There is tons of room for the family and you never feel like you sacrificed style or performance. If you are looking for a great performing, look at me style vehicle for a great price, this is the car for you. Great job Mazda!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had been looking at Avalons, BMWs, Lexus, & Audi. Had pretty much decided on a Lexus ES350. Then on a whim we stopped to look at the Mazda 6 and bought a Grand Touring S with all the bells and whistles. It's as good or better than any of the above named cars for a lot less $$. This is my second Mazda. The first was a 92 MX3 that I commuted in for several years. Put 160+ thousand miles on that one with no complaints.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking at this and the Altima. Liked the Altima but loved the Mazda. Steering is tight like a sports car, yet it sips fuel (30 MPG on a 200 mile trip averaging 75 MPH). Not bad for a lead foot! Wind noise was very minimal. Great fit and finish on the interior materials. Love the Bose speakers, bluetooth, and noise reduction feature. Push button start is fun too. Smooth to drive and the 4-cyl engine provides power when needed. I am 6'3" and have plenty of room. Dealer was 6'5" and could sit comfortably behind me on the test drive. On my way home from the dealer, I had two people ask me at a light what I was driving!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Blind Spot Monitoring is amazing! Had people back up and speed up so they could see the icon light up. Lively 4-cyl engine, great fuel economy. Stereo rocks, once you set the options. Bluetooth is great for taking calls. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having checked out all the obvious competition, we felt we had to compare the Mazda6 to something better as it beat all the regulars. We liked the styling of the 2009 Lexus IS250 a lot and did a side by side comparison. The bottom line: a loaded 6 versus a loaded IS250 was $7800 less even after getting a deal offer on the Lexus. The IS still didn't have all the features available with the 6. The choice was simple then. Driving the car shows that the Zoom Zoom hasn't been lost. It is just fun to drive, gets good gas mileage and has all the toys you would ever want in a car. The proof is in the drive. Don't buy a car without test driving the 6. It drove better than the IS and we are thrilled.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior styling and options. I like the front and side views. My wife likes the back. The drive is fantastic, optional sound is top drawer and the nav is the best we've had. Lighting at night is exceptional both inside and out.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Mazda got it right! My criteria were Xenon headlights, regular gas, and more than 20 MPG city. But you get a whole lot more! Great styling, comfort, lots of bells & whistles. Lots of safety features. Keyless entry and push-button start is great! There are several programmable features like auto door lock, how many doors unlock with remote, lighting delay, etc., and you can hit the "clock" button to view trip info without having to use "info button". Mazda hit a home run! The car is competition for Lexus ES350, not just Honda, Toyota & Nissan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought my Mazda 6 last weekend. Six cylinder Grand Touring - loaded except nav system. The tech features are so great - blue tooth, Bose stereo, Sirius radio, hi tech key fob, fantastic seats. I remember driving my friend's 8 cylinder Mustang GT when I was in college and this car feels exactly like that. Feels very "American" to drive. I absolutely love the way the car handles and after owning a Miata in the past, I hope the maintenance and reliability hold up like that car did. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After test driving the "Big 3" sedans (Camry, Accord, Altima), I decided to give the new 6 a try. The redesign has done wonders, both exterior and interior. Quality of the interior is much better than the others, especially in my GT. It has features the others don't was well like LED tail's, standard BT and a blind spot monitoring system. The 4 banger suits my needs, but it might be the weak point of the car. I felt the Honda had the best, followed by the Altima, then the Camry. I'm only a few hundred miles into the car, but I have ZERO regrets about my decision. Mazda has taken a step forward and should draw a lot of attention w/ this one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Before I buy I always look at the field of cars in the class. When I came across the 6 I had to knock out the Accord, Camry and all the like. What comes on the car as standard are for the most part options or not even available on competitors (Xenon head lights). Once you pop on a few options you've got a car equipped more like a premium class car. This car really is a lot of value for the money. I've only had mine for a short while and I'm not sorry one bit I bought it. As far as I'm concerned Toyota and Honda have some catch to do to match the new 6. This is one heck of a value for well under 30 G.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased my first Mazda. After researching the Accord, Camry and Altima, I ended up in a new 2009 Mazda6 Grand Touring. It was really an easy decision after comparing these cars and what I could get for my $$. My Mazda is loaded and a blast to drive! This is my first Mazda and I have to say, I'm very impressed. I initially wanted the V6, but after driving them both, I decided the 4 cylinder would be more efficient on gas. I don't regret it at all. It's very peppy, in fact, it is even spunkier than my old car which was a V6! I highly recommend this vehicle. If you're on the fence about what to buy, take one for a drive... you'll be sold!</TEXT>

If you put the car up against it's competition you have to come up with the Mazda 6. Hands down. I haven't had the car but a couple weeks, and everyone at work is like nice car, what is it? Now they know. What's not to love? Thank you Mazda. Keep doing what your doing. People are watching. This is one happy customer. ZOOM-ZOOM!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have to say that I have thoroughly enjoyed the 1,200 miles driven on my Mazda 6 since the purchase. I decided to go with the 2.5L instead of the 6 cyl because of the commute that I have and with gas prices on the steady rise the choice was simple. When looking to replace my Mazda 3 (manual), I looked at many different vehicles, but in the end came back to the Mazda 6. The 2.5 has plenty of get-up and go for everyday driving. I also like the new interior n the 09 models. No offense to Toyota, but Mazda takes first in that category. As far as fuel economy, I am averaging 28+ mpg with blended driving of highway and city. Not bad for a car this size. Great Job Mazda</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were ready to replace our old Mazda6 back in April of this year, but decided to wait for the 2009. I'm glad we did, for this vehicle is so much better. It has a larger interior, larger trunk and we opted for the i Grand Touring with remote keyless doors and ignition, dual zone climate control, leather heated seats and we opted for the moonroof and sound upgrade package. The car still handles great like the older version but is so much more comfortable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Me and the wife have an older 6 (2003 6i Sport) that is getting a little long in the tooth. She was looking at a Lexus IS but I persuaded her to look at this new 6. We do not regret this purchase! It is powerful, comfortable, roomy, and is a looker inside and out. We bought a fully loaded performance white 6s with moonroof, Bose, satellite radio and navi, and is worth every penny. It is a blast to drive, smooth and effortless power delivery out of the 6 cyl and 6 speed auto. The seats are firm but comfortable, the sound system can rattle the doors off if you like, and the trunk is huge. This is supposed to be my wife's car, but I find myself hogging the driver's seat, ha!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was a previous Mazda owner years ago, currently a BMW owner. I had been reading about the totally redesigned 2009 Mazda 6 coming out for months now, so when my wife was looking to replace her 2002 BMW 530, I said lets take a quick look at the 2009 Mazda 6 first. Well she loved it and we bought it. With the new "6", Mazda continues to move closer to having the most exciting lineup of any manufacturer today. Exterior looks very Lexus like ( especially from the back). The interior room has been increased dramatically and the truck is huge. With the bigger engine, it has plenty of power. Bose sound system rocks. At around 30K, there is no better value for the money. Initial enjoyment is off the charts. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife has an 08 Mazda6, which we love, but when I saw the 09 I had to have it. It is roomier without looking like a large car, the 4 cyl has a little bit more kick to it and is good enough for most people. I have the advanced keyless, which rocks, and other than the 'new engine' smell I've had with every Mazda ever (which goes away in about 100 miles) this car appears very solidly built and corners just like the 08. Stereo is better too, and the control layout is easier to deal with. The dash is gorgeous at night. It's too early to tell MPG yet, but all things considered this is a fun car to drive with lots of the nice things that make long trips enjoyable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Drove all the "Camcordias" - new 6 as comfortable as they are -you don't see it "coming and going" - to me that's one of the best features. I got the 4 cyl - my first 4 banger - engine in smooth - but I miss the power and pickup of a 6 cyl. Gas mileage is about 25mpg around town - have 800 miles on the car (10 days driving). Automatic 5 speed is good on upshifts - downshifts are rough when coming around a turn and stepping on gas - it waits too long to shift and kind of bangs into lower gear. The "tiptronic" is lots of fun and works really well (though I find the "pushing forward" for downshift and pulling back for upshift to be backwards) Next time - 6 cyl with manual trans!</TEXT>

It's worth the wait as I am always thrilled driving the new 6 everyday. The looks is sporty and gorgeous - the best in its class. Inside has a premium feel - luxurious and comfortable. Albeit the bigger size, the 6 did not lose the great handling that it was known for. I am averaging 23.5 - 24 MPG highway and city driving combined. I think a decent MPG rate on its size. Still have to put some more miles and years to test the reliability. For now, I will continue always looking forward driving my sexy six.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I put off buying a new mid-size sedan for a couple of months as I knew the '09 Mazda6 was coming in August. The wait was 100% worth it. It's the best looking car in its class without question. The interior is easily a full class ahead of the Camry, Accord, Altima, or Malibu. As with most Mazdas, the handling is excellent making it a pure joy to drive. I can't imagine anyone test driving all the mid-size sedans out there and not picking the 6. The features/fit/finish etc are closer to a Lexus ES350 than a Camry. This car is going to own the magazine mid-size comparison tests for at least 2-3 years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a previous lease owner of the Mazda 6 2005 for 42 month. Enjoyed that car except 4 cyl was not enough for summer driving because of AC system takes power from engine. Mazda got it right this time. Driving new 09 model for a week now, already see a lot of improvements. Torque is much better even with AC on. Transmission is much smoother when shifting. Interior design improved dramatically. More roomy. Dash board has few new fitures but again I have basic package cant help you there. I do have auxiliary input that allows me to connect my iPod, very cool. Sound system is awesome, 8 speakers and subwoofer standard.

I have test drove the new Accord, the new Altima, and I had the new 2009 Camry SE. None of them compare to this car. This car looks better then them all and drives better. I am a little skeptical on the reliability issue, since it isn't Toyota, Honda, or Nissan. But regardless, this car is awesome. it has things that only luxury cars like the BMW or Benz has.

I drove an Acura 3.2TL and this car is certainly on par. It is true what many of the previous reviews have said it is a sporty luxuary car without the Lexus nameplate. The car handles well takes bumps without much thump, engine is very quiet. The upgraded stereo is music to the ears and I have had no problems with the GPS Nav system other than it seems to dislike guiding you the the nearest highway sometimes. Fit and Finish are above par and the engine is very quiet with lots of pep in the 6 Mazda has a winner here </TEXT>

<TEXT>Best in class! My wife has an Altima 3.5 SE CVT Coupe with all options. I wanted a car with all the same features but in a sedan that has more style than all the others in it's class. The Mazda 6s GT does it all with style. I bought a 1st gen Mazda 6s in 2003, which was a decent car for the price. It wasn't better than others in it's class back then. The new 6 is a far superior car. Mazda engineers really hit the mark with it. I was looking at the next step up in class (Maxima or G37) for style, tech pkg, refinement. The 6 matches them and for way less money. Test them all - Fusion, Malibu, Accord, Camry, Altima. It's awesome and performs like my 04 A6 2.7T I just sold ONLY BETTER</TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving the Mazda6, none of the other cars I tested (Altima, Accord, Legacy, Camry) could match the combination of features/performance/style. The acceleration is better than I expected with a 4cyl and the suspension has an excellent balance between handling and comfort. The Michelin tires do squeal too early though. The dashboard is very intuitive and easy to use. The GT has more features than I know what to do with. I especially love the blue tooth connection for my cell phone. The only minor disappointment is the gas mileage. After 2 months, I'm only getting 21 mpg in combo city/highway driving but that's a small price to pay for an excellent car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A little over a year ago I purchased a new Nissan Altima. It was close to a strip model and I was never really satisfied with the car. Checked out the Mazda6 with the 4 cylinder and thought it was a nicely appointed car but the power was not what I expected. The dealer pulled around a Touring S model with the V6. Wow what a difference, I was sold as soon as I hit the acceleration. I got a great deal since they were having huge rebates and $1000 buyer loyalty credit.

<TEXT>I just picked mine up this week. I think the looks are awesome, it rides very well. Just the balance of firmness and softness. The cabin is very quiet and the features, especially with the Convenience and the Bose package are well worth it. I will say the Bose, while sufficient, is less than I expected. It is a very comfortable and roomy car. The roomy backseat makes this a great family sedan. I was very surprised that I was able to get rubber in second gear.

<TEXT>Purchased new in Oct 08 and received a great deal. Have 6200 miles on it and have not had any issues. Mileage is great, performance is great. Paint quality/durability seems to be lacking. Possibly needs a better clear coat? Ride comfort, features, quiet interior, and looks are really nice. No issues at all. Prefer the "old school" oil filter spin on canisters, but hopefully a conversion kit will be out soon. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Pros: Body style is distinctive. Standard DSC. Roomy. Quiet at highway speed. Uncluttered dash controls. Huge trunk. Nice firm suspension. You don't blend into the sea of Camcords in a parking lot. Good combination of fuel efficiency, size, handling, and looks. Base stereo far better than our Civic EX-L. Cons: Front seats shaped weirdly, not the best comfort. Steering wheel obscures top of gauges when adjusted properly. Stupid red gauge lighting reminds me of wife's old junky pontiac grand-am. Auto trans shifts in and out of overdrive too often. Clear shifter surround panel scratches easily. Little support from online forums, not nearly as much as VW or Honda message boards.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Front windows roll down from keyfob on a hot day. Appearance. Quiet and smooth on highway with remarkably low wind noise. Stability Control.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this Mazda 6 as an upgrade from my Mazda 3. This car is unbelievable. Not only is it fun to drive, but the ride is out of this world. You get it all in this Mazda 6, comfort, luxury, eye catching and don't forget the Zoom Zoom. I looked and test drove 3 other cars (Infiniti G37, VW Passat CC & Toyota Venza) This car beats them 9 out of 10 categories. If you are looking for a new car I would recommend you take this Mazda 6 for a ride...You will not be disappointed</TEXT>

<TEXT>After carefully shopping all midsized autos, there was no contest - the others just didn't match up. Now after over 8,000 mi and traveling from Cal to Ala. and back I'm still impressed. It's a combination of capabilities - on curvy mountain roads it's a sports car; when passing up hill on a two lane road it's a hot rod; when hauling people it's a roomy, comfortable, relaxing ride. What was most surprising was the gas mileage - better than advertised. I get 21 and a half doing 50-50 town and country, and driving cross country with hours at 75 and 80 mph I averaged just over 27 mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power, responsiveness,comfort on 600 mile driving days. The easily accessible, large trunk. The beautiful body and the excellent dash layout with the most intuitive readouts and controls I've seen. And of course, the BSW and total keyless system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove the 2008 G35 sedan, the 2008 Saab9-5, the Lincoln MKZ, and the 2009 Nissan Maxima and found the 2009 Mazda6 to be a better value for the money compared to all of them. It really is fun to drive and has a lot of power when you need it. It has great stylish looks inside and out and I like that Mazda took a tested engine (from the CX-9) and didn't make a brand new one. It will be interesting to see how this does now against the Honda Accord and Toyota Camery since it's now on par with those cars and might be an even better value.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car with a 2-year old son in mind. I needed a four door car with a little sportiness to it. I found it in the 2009 Mazda 6. I was impressed with the overall design of this car. I considered it better than the American cars I saw on the road. It had the right amount of power for my taste and the amenities are extraordinary. I got the iTouring with the Bose system, it has some kick. The 2.5 4 suits me fine, but the fuel economy was a little lacking, but thats ok. The quality and design are the reason I got this car and I left the dealer feeling pretty satisfied.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded a 98 Lexus sedan with 170,000 miles for the new s grand touring. Looked at Camray and Accord but thought the Mazda offered better value for the money. Interior is refined with no gimmicks to clutter the appearance, although materials are plastic, appearance is disguised well. Love the red / blue night lighting. Power is superb and delivered effortlessly via the 6 speed automatic.The auto-stick is also fun for a change now and then. Ride is sporty, not plush. Navigation works very well although the menu operating system is a bit quirky compared to other units. Sound system is a 10+. Only complaint with 10k miles is the paint seems a bit fragile, with numerous front bumper chips.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always liked to drive a stick and so I opted for the 6 speed manual. It is a mistake on this car. The gearing is such that the car revs at 3000 RPM or higher on the highway at 65-70 MPH. I drove an automatic when on a trip recently, and it only revs at 2000-2500 RPM at highway speeds. This gearing is probably why the automatic gets better mileage. The automatic shifts fast and smooth and is no slouch either. If I had it to do again, automatic all the way. The four isn't bad. But the six kicks tail. If you can get the six for a good deal, jump on it. You won't regret it even with the lower gas mileage. Option wise, it is almost in a class with a Lexus</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my Mazda6 itouring for 4 months now and I can tell you without a doubt this is the best car for the money on the road. I test drove 13 cars before deciding to pull the trigger on the 6. I drove both the i&s and decided on the 4 cylinder for the fuel economy. It has plenty of jump and is really fun to drive. I love the improvements they made redesigning this car. I have put this car up against the BMW 3 series, the Acura TL, the Honda Accord, and several more. It more than holds it's own with handling and suspension. Everyone tells me how nice this car is. It is so fun to drive. What more can I say? Zoom Zoom!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favs would be the overall appearance of the car, the perfectly placed controls, the compartments for all my accessories(ie. garage opener, bluetooth headset, glasses, gps, ipod, etc), and the OE Michelin MXV4's are really a smooth ride. Suspension is really good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a car! Style-wise, Mazda hit a grand-slam: roomy 4-door practicality with unique sporty 2-door styling & so many features per $! Really nice 17" alloys. Stock audio system pretty good. Keyless start system rocks! Awesome dash layout & display at night. Super- smooth & quiet ride. Comfy seats. Perfect steering feel. Glides over curvy roads & corners with grace. SO fun-to-drive! Doors yield loud THUNK when shut! Greatest surprise: Even with 5spd auto trans, the 170hp 2.5 4cyl engine routinely leaves other cars in my rearview mirror from full stops with little effort. Even outperforms the 170hp v6 in my '98 626LX despite being much larger car. Generates refined, throaty growl. Superb!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We originally dismissed this car because of its perceived weak gas mileage against its key competitors. We test drove them all and looked for several months at options. However, after test driving a Ford Fusion that had pieces falling off during the test drives, and a Malibu which was just too small with its lack of shoulder and width room....we came back to the Mazda. The V6 engine is fantastic. Smooth as silk. And doesn't have the annoying cylinder shut down like the Accord V6. Build quality is very solid and the ride feels great. Handles better than the Camry. The bonus has been the mileage. Thus far we have been getting 22 combined with at least 75% city driving. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Blind Spot Monitoring is great. NAV and touch screen audio controls are very cool and easy to operate. Aero Dynamics on Moon Roof are solid. Hardly any wind noise when its opened.

Respectable gas mileage, 22 city, 27 highway. Somewhat disappointed in overall comfort and noise issues. High level of road noise from 18" tires, very sensitive steering, stiff ride, and noisy engine and compressor/fans (very annoying). Unfavorable reflection of top of dash in front window. Engine/fan noise addressed once, but not convinced it is entirely corrected. Will pursue with dealership and will get used to the other minor discomforts.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were on our way to test drive a new Camry. Took a swing into the Mazda dealer because I knew the design had changed and wanted to check it out. After a test drive we kept our appointment w/ the Toyota dealer. This Mazda has it all over the Camry, I couldn't even get alloy wheels on the LE model (which really pi**ed me off). Short story, we went back to Mazda and got a good deal on a car (so far, 2 mos) that I think is nicer than the Camry (which is a very nice car).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Let me start by saying that in general I love this car. The instrumentation is very intuitive and I find the exterior to be very sleek and it doesn't scream "I've got car seats inside" like some other family targeted vehicles. I love the bigger V6 and the room trunk and cabin. My only complaint is on the Grand Touring model I have is it has the cheesiest faux marble plastic trim along the dash and the cupholder. A few editor reviews mention this but I haven't seen it much on readers comments so perhaps it just me. Waiting for an aftermarket solution but for me a flat black or polished aluminum trim would have made the car almost perfect. </TEXT>

No withdrawal symptoms, the 6 is possibly taking Nissan's title of 4 dr Sports Car. Also looked at the new Accord; have owned Hondas and Nissans in the past, and know both to be excellent cars and great values. I could not get past the ugliness of the new Accord or the price tag for the new Maxima. Getting 20mpg avg, think the 6 is comparable to Lexus and Acura</TEXT>

<TEXT>When driving my new Mazda 6(I've had it two weeks) with the rear windows down there is severe buffeting and air pressure that caused the eardrums of three of us to hurt even though we only were subjected to this phenomenon for about 10 seconds. Never experienced this in any car I have ever owned. Anyone else have this problem? If so, what did you do? Did you call Mazda and what was their response? Also, I calculated the mileage I got driving locally and it was 23.7 MPG although the car's computer indicated 18.8 MPG.

<TEXT>Where to start? I was in the market for either the Audi A4 or Lexus IS250 but landed in a Mazda 6. I drove past a Mazda dealership, the new 6 just stood out. I went in, test drove the car and here I am 3 months later loving my decision! They compare the Mazda 6 to the Accord and Camry (class- wise) however, it does not compare! It is far superior and should instead weight against cars like the A4 and IS250. Sounds crazy I know but I am a total 'gear head' and was dead set on one of the aforementioned cars. The 6 changed my mind! This car is nimble, responsive and fast! It has all of the high end comforts without the high end price tag. I could not be happier with my decision.......!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quickness and handling highlight the cars' overall attractiveness (for me anyway). Interior space (I'm 6'2, 210) and layout were well thought out by Mazda.

There is no auto headlight feature standard. You must spend about 1500-1600 more to get the xenon package. The auto on should be standard! Very irritating after having auto on on previous vehicle. Center console armrest is poorly padded. It is adequate at best. The radio is not the best quality. I find myself constantly adjusting the bass/treble to get a decent sound.

I wrote in my initial review we loved the car and hoped it would be as reliable as all of our other Mazda's have been. Switched oil to Mobil 1 synthetic at the first change. We average 22.4 around town and 28.3 on the road. The car is as good as our 04 as it is rock solid, totally reliable but it is more comfortable than our 04 Mazda6. It is a great car and we love it. The V-6 has more than enough power and I find the fuel economy pretty fair. All in all we are very pleased with the car and look forward to driving it for years to come.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got the Mazda 6 iTouring with convenience package. I looked at the Accord, Camry, Altima, Fusion, and Jetta - Mazda 6 is at the top of its class. The only other car I was considering was the Accord, but I found the Mazda to have better overall value for the money, and the exterior/interior styling is a bit better. The speed, ride, and handling of this car is excellent. I find myself taking fast turns for no reason because it's simply just fun to do. The quietness of the car is very good - my dad, who has drives Mercedes, was even impressed with the quietness. If you're looking at the Touring model, I would highly suggest the convenience package - excellent value for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Convenience package with blind spot monitoring, bluetooth phone/audio, rain-sensing wipers, and auto headlights. Interior quietness is great. Ride/Handling is excellent.

Stability/traction control, trip computer, MP3 capable stereo and advanced key (no key start and door-locks) just to name a few. Handling/engine power is great, road/wind noise is low, and interior and controls are well laid-out.

A quieter ride, more surefooted feel, nice build quality, great looks/lighting, etc. Love the Bluetooth and BMS, along with the advanced keyless system. Very satisfied.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked at Honda Accord and Nissan Altima but Mazda6 beat them for style, fun and value. With the S plan and rebates the price i paid was unbeatable. The Mazda6 combines RX8 style and sportiness with refined drive and amazing space. Just too much all-round appeal for me and this in now my 4th Mazda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After looking at the malibu LTZ (v6), accord EX-L v6, and altima the choice was obvious for me. Mazda all the way. I have never owned a mazda, but the features and amenities are 2nd to none and with current manufacturer rebates/incentives, I simply couldn't walk away. I ended up getting my loaded mazda 6 grand touring at about 3400 under invoice. The mazda6 is still relatively new, so its nice to not be one of the crowd. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I still love my Mazda6, but I have to downgrade the build quality(interior only) just a bit as I've found now, a total of three "fit and finish" issues, all three being on the driver's side(maybe the result of a disgruntled, or "could care less" assembler on that side),e.g., small cover over speaker attached on one corner only, control switch panel "cover" on driver's door bowed slightly in middle, preventing a flush fit, and a 1/2 inch gap between plastic fits near console...None of these things are terribly important, but irritating. There isn't a single issue or problem on the passenger side. The car is still great fun to drive, and everything else about my previous review holds.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my 2006 Mustang GT Convertible Premium Upgrade Package for this vehicle. Initially this was for practical reasons, I needed a Nav system, 4 doors and a larger trunk. Test drove BMW, Honda, and Toyota. All had pros and cons. The most awesome drive was the BMW but dollar for dollar the Mazda outshines all. Read all the reviews here and noticed a pattern, Mazda owners and BMW owners really rated their cars very highly and were passionate about their cars. It's amazing that I continually find more features about this car that I didn't fully appreciate. Now I am looking for reasons to drive! Also found a dealer that put zero pressure on me and invoice pricing without hassles!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is just my 3rd vehicle I've owned since I began driving. My previous two cars were Acuras ('04 RSX & '07 RDX), so I was looking for something sporty, yet luxurious. When I originally began looking, I went to the dealer and test drove the all-new 2010 Mazda3, but I noticed that Mazda had great incentives on the 6. Later that day, I test drove a Mazda6 and instantly fell for it. I decided on the Brillant Silver w/ Moonroof & Bose package. I didn't get Navi because I have my own unit already.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a Speed6 before this. I needed to "grow up", but still wanted to enjoy driving. 6-speed automatic delivers seamless shifts so well I almost don't miss the Speed6's manual. The power seat and tilt/telescope steering wheel it easy to attain a comfortable driving position and still see all the gauges. The "blue halo" effect at night takes a little getting used to. The cabin is tastefully done, and many people have commented on the rich feel Mazda has given this car. There's plenty of room front and rear, and the fold-down rear seats are convenient. The exterior is very well executed, especially the wheel well bulges at front and rear. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So glad after 5 months I chose this car. I got the i touring 2.5L auto, with the convenience package. The only thing that made me hesitant was the gas mileage. I am consistently averaging 28 mpg per tank. I don't do any stop and go driving, but not much highway either. I got over 32 mpg on one long trip. Mileage suffers about 10- 15% if you go over 70 mpg. All the other positives the editors discuss hold true. Roomy, comfortable, GREAT handling. Blindspot monitoring option is very helpful. No regrets what so ever. I was looking at the Altima, Altima Hybrid, Camry and Accord and am glad I chose the Mazda6!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did most of my research online and only test drove a Mazda 3 then a Mazda 6. I love Subarus also but wanted better mileage than all wheel drive delivers. With the incentives Mazda has right now and being a current Mazda Tribute owner I really couldn't resist getting a cool looking family sedan that get's good mileage and is very comfortable. The standard features on this model are great. I just have it one week and my first highway drive yielded over 32mpg. Seats are very comfortable and basic radio is fine if you adjust the bass down and treble up. (you can always throw two extra speakers below rear window, there are holes for it). The 4 cyl seems more than capable for most situations.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We made a decision to sell a 2007 Chev Suburban and a 2006 Cad CTS to cut payments and insurance and improve fuel economy. I traded my CTS for a 2009 Mazda6 - what a pleasant surprise. The crash test ratings were higher (surprise) and while the CTS was a great car - I like this one better. Very comfortable - more than enough power (despite having 100HP and 2 cylinders less). Extremely comfortable in the front and VERY roomy backseat. I like the fold down seat backs. Everyone who sees the car says it is beautiful. I had read some complaints about road noise, but I'm struggling to find that - could be different tires. Overall I am rating this one a "ten" and for less than % 25,000.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very comfortable front and rear, high IIHS crash test ratings, great brakes, responsive steering, good sound system, many thoughtful little details - MILEAGE (23.4 in the city - no highway).

<TEXT>I love my new Mazda6! I've only had the car a week, so I can't actually attest to it's reliability, but, from my limited experience with this car, I can't think of many things to complain about. It handles great, is quiet, the Bose system is very nice, not necessarily exceptional, but very nice nonetheless. Fit and finish seems exceptionally nice. The doors give that solid "thunk" sound when closed. There are many soft touch surfaces inside, and very few cheap plastics. Nice amenities abound, with lights galore. The trunk is huge, with nifty little side hooks to hang grocery sacks or whatever. The car looks good both inside and out. Great job Mazda!! You won this former Camry owner over....</TEXT>

<TEXT>Moved up from a Mazda3, and am very impressed with how smooth and quiet the car is. Exterior styling is edgy without being too trendy and should hold up well over the years. Interior styling is simple and elegant, and mostly very high quality (but what's up with the thin vinyl on the armrest and the Buick velour on the door panels??). On a 500 mile trip I averaged 34mpg in mostly rural driving at 60-65mph with a good bit of stop- and-go intown driving, and have been averaging about 27mpg around town. Pretty awesome for such a big car. I love that the car looks big, but drives like a much smaller car. The ride is firm, but very compliant, a near perfect balance of handling and ride comfort. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bose sound system, keyless entry with pushbutton start, quietness of interior, great seats, tilt/telescoping wheel, fuel economy, the way the car greets you with "zoom- zoom" message at start up, smooth ride with awesome handling, not seeing one everywhere like "Camcordtimas", but that might change:)</FAVORITE>

The ride is excellent and the car is a real head turner. Although the car is not fully loaded (No Nav system - it is equipped with everything we need, except maybe heated seats). The car has handled superbly in severe winter conditions - heavy snow and ice. We feel in control, even when driving conditions are bad. This has been a great buy and my wife and I would purchase this again - maybe one for me! Mazda really hit a home run with this re-design and we are looking forward to the 2010 Mazda 3!

<TEXT>Bought the Mazda6s Touring in Dec and it has been a decent vehicle. The V6 engine performs well, yet like others have said; not as refined. My 07 V6 accord was a touch more refined. It makes some odd noises at idle as well. The car is plenty quick, but you will pay the price in gas mileage. In mixed driving, I will avg. 16- 18mpg, which is not acceptable. My Accord would at least get 21, but wasn't as fun to drive. While the car is bigger, it does not always feel that way inside. The trunk is big but the height inside the trunk seems short. The base audio setup sounds terrible. No clarity or depth whatsoever, plan on a upgrade. Lastly, the 18inch tires are very loud and sensitive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Black on black with the convenience package and rear spoiler. Looks are fantastic and it's one of the best looking cars out there. Handles very well around corners. Very little cabin noise. Controls are perfectly placed. Push-button start takes time to get used to if you're used to having a key in your hand as you exit the car. 2.5L has some zip to it and gets up to speed quickly. Leather trim does look cheap and seats are a bit hard. Interior lights look fantastic! Bluetooth works well and very easy to set-up, however have been told that it has some static on the other end.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was in the market for over 9 months and I was deciding between the Mazda 6 and Lexus IS 250. Yes these two vehicles are very different and both had their pros and cons. I settled on the Mazda because of a larger size, more horsepower, larger trunk, more options for the price and fold down seats. In return, I gave up rear wheel drive and a better warranty. I am very happy with the purchase, so don?t get turned off by my review. This car is fast and fun to drive. The controls are easy to operate and intuitive. The leather seats are not as comfortable and my 2001 Maxima, but they are softening up with time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm over 6' tall and my other vehicle is a Dodge truck that I love for its legroom. The Mazda 6 has really impressed me over the past two months with its excellent handling, features, and great styling. When I was car shopping I test drove the Honda Accord, Nissan Altima, and Chevy Malibu for comparison and it beats them all in style and has better features for the price than the Accord and Malibu-hopefully the reliability pans out well too, but its too early to know for certain. So, if you're in the market for a sedan don't pass up the best car for under $25k-maybe the best under $30k- the 6. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the 2009 M6 last week, it's already in service. With two problems, mind you - pretty minor, but still. One, the heating system did not work properly - radiator needed to be bled. Two, one of the air vents, driver side on the left, did not open. Some broken peace of plastic the dealership did not have in stock, it needs to be ordered, and then I have to go back again to have it put in. I bought this car because I had 250 k on my old Accord, I thought it's getting to old, and did not want to spend time in repair shops. I had one minor issue with the Accord in 10 years, at around 180 k km, and with Mazda, 2 issues in the first week. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After totaling our Honda Pilot, we decided to go with a sedan. Vehicles we compared against were Fusion, Malibu, G8, used G35, and Accord. Out of the bunch, we kept coming back to the Mazda6. Here's why: Fun to drive factor: there's no question that this car will be putting smiles on our faces for years to come. Our 13 year old son even says it looks cool. On some back roads in Talledega Forest, this car begged to be driven fast...80+MPH is where this car feels best. Interior design and room: Only the Accord has more room, but the Mazda6 GT definitely has the best options...bluetooth, blind spot monitoring, top quality interior workmanship for this class, and an awesome audio system. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After considering both the six and four cylinder engines, I decided to purchase an i touring (4 cylinder) with the moonroof/Bose package and the convenience package. The car has almost all the features of the grand touring but costs much less, and it is a joy to drive. The 2.5 liter 4cyl is peppy enough for normal city and highway driving yet offers reasonable gas mileage for such a large car. I have no problems merging or passing on the interstate. The interior is phenomenal - very well thought out, comfortable, and beautiful, especially at night. I test-drove most of the competitors, and I found the Mazda to be a far better value (size, comfort, features, etc.) than the competition. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features have to be the advanced keyless entry, push-button start, xenon headlights, bluetooth hands-free setup, blind spot monitoring (this system is surprisingly accurate and helpful), and the Bose sound system. I also love how customizable these options are to my preferences. </FAVORITE>

Felt comfortable from the first test drive. Tested Corolla, Civic, Camry, and others but settled on the 6 for its combination of style, handling, features, and safety. Great value. Can be a bit slow off the stop line, but the 4 cyl flies nicely on the highway once at speed. Convenience package is a must to get rid of the Buick like upholstered door trim. Xenon lights a huge plus. Bose sound is great. Like the aux jack in the armrest. Rural road and expressway commute - averaging 27-28 mpg at 2700 mi.</TEXT>

With the exception of the AWD this is as close as you can get to the Audi but with Japanese quality and reliability. I put this Mazda as best-in-class. The 4 cyl. has plenty of power as it goes through the gears and pull nicely in cruise at highway speeds. With just under 500 miles we are averaging 27.8 mpg city/highway. It is so quiet that when stopped at a light, have to check the tach to see if it is running. You must check this car out!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We shopped long and hard for a car, comparing more than 10 manufacturers. We first drove a 2008 Mazda 6, and were not impressed with the interior room compared to others in its class. Once we got in a 2009 however, our minds were made up. We have owned it for 5 months, (8000 miles), and have loved every minute. The 4 cylinder has plenty of zoom-zoom, and gets good gas mileage. We average 26-28 mpg, and are pretty heavy on the pedal. Highway trips we get 31-32 mpg. Often while driving, I will smile at my daughter and say "I love this car". The grand touring would have been nice, but we couldn't justify the extra cost.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car less than a month ago but already love it. Coming from owning a Corvette, modified BMW, 69 Camaro among others, I must say this is one excellent car. It's not as demanding to drive as the Vette, or a nimble as my old 3 series, yet driving it reminds me of both in its own way. It has excellent power in the V6, is extremely tossable with great balance for a front driver. Power is completely smooth and linear, and shifts are crisp. Gas mileage isn't bad, but it's not great either, 6th gear seems a bit too short. It has 5 others to have fun!</TEXT>
