<TEXT>Been Toyota Tacoma driver for 14 years. Frontier seems ok so far. Rides a little ruff, think it's going to be a rattling truck. Hearing some noises already, bought on 7/31. Stereo is very nice so w/volume up can't hear noises. 4cy automatic doesn't do too well w/cruise on. Like roominess cab, love access doors. Bigger than my 1995 Tacoma so I'm getting used to tighter turning radius. Did cash for clunker & couldn't get Toyota. If I had do overs I might would have taken my chances on waiting to get Tacoma, that was my 1st choice. Just not sure it's going to last me 14 years like last truck. On this review, I'm not sure I chose the right style. It's 4Cy, king cab, power package, full bed </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the access doors, higher ride. Like storage area above glove box. Very nice stereo. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought mine after a 3 month search, the guy at the dealership was great at finding my truck, and he gave me a great deal. I love this truck. Its rugged, and can take a beating. After a few rough off-road sessions and about 20k miles, the suspension loosened up a little more than I would have liked, but I should have bought the Pro 4X, which I am going to do now that my truck has been totaled in an accident. Which is another reason I love this truck, it took a 60 mph head on collision with a utility trailer & truck when they came into my lane from the other direction. I walked away, but the truck was totaled, but the important thing is it saved me. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6 speed manual, toolbox under the seat & other interior storage, towing & cargo capacity, ability to take a beating.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The cash for clunkers program stimulated me to trade but it would have been well worth it, even if I had to pay the extra $4500. Nice ride, better mileage than what I was driving and looks great. The 4 cylinder is sufficient for my purpose of mostly driving and some hauling.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats and general ride are comfortable enough that I would consider taking this on a long trip (10 hour drive)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In my original review, I mentioned that the brakes produced a strange feel just before a complete stop and immediately after acceleration. I took my truck in to the local Az Nissan dealer to have the oil changed and to check the condition of the brakes. I also wanted them to check the driver's side sun visor because it seemed loose and does not stay against the windshield. When I went to pick up the truck, the service manager told me that these conditions were observed with other like vehicles on the lot and that the condition was considered as being normal. If you purchase one of these 2009 Frontiers and expect the dealer to "fix" these conditions, think again. They were no help at all.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Other than the conditions stated above, I love my truck. It looks great and runs great. If it were not for the two conditions above, I would highly recommend the 2009 Nissan Frontier to friends and family. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Nissan Frontier, I've owned and drove my 2001 for 8 years and I must say it has been the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned, I still own it. I've owned the new Frontier for 2 months now and the only complaints I have thus far is the drivers seat and the center console. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned the frontier for about 4 mo. Previously owned a gmc sierra ext. Cab 4 dr. I drive the frontier to work every day, siff suspension and jerking of the steering wheel when I hit a pot hole spoils the fun of driving. I've never seen any car do that before. For some reason u can't turn wheels too fast when puling to park, even with two hands there seems to be strong resistance. Turning radius is awful, can't make a u-turn on a 2-way street, previous truck did it with ease. Engine is not as responsive as I would like it to be, everything is electronic even gas pedal. When need to quickly accelerate at 60 mph it takes 2 sec for transmission to downshift a gear and then it downshift one more gr</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Great Truck!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I did a good bit of research before deciding on this Frontier, and I'm totally happy with my decision. I looked at Tacoma, Ridgeline, Dakota, and Colorado before I decided on the Frontier. I have 500 miles and have gotten about 17mpg in mostly city driving in Atlanta with the A/C running (better than I expected). Overall, the truck rides well, looks good, is comfortable, and can haul a decent amount for it's size. It definitely fits my needs for a commuter truck that becomes a work truck on the weekends.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling inside and out, power, ride, visibility, fully boxed frame, disc brakes, utili-track system, sunroof, storage bins, size of truck is perfect for my needs-fits in the garage easily.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently traded in my 2007 Mazda3 due to the rough winters in the northeast. I never really considered a Frontier, but I'm glad I checked it out! Wow! What a truck! The ride quality blew me away and is far superior to the Tacoma. The engine is refined and powerful. I don't really baby the truck for mileage, but I've managed 20 in the city, which is way better than I thought. No major highway trips yet, so I can't comment on highway mileage. The long bed option is awesome and the spray in bedliner and utili-track system are great features. If you're in the market for a mid-sized truck, do yourself a favor and test drive this beauty. I promise you won't be disappointed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine and transmission are a match made in heaven, buttery smooth ride quality, all seats are extremely comfortable, 4 wheel disc brakes are awesome, innovative bed features, rear window has integrated defroster.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this truck this week for my birthday...my husband and I have been wanting truck for years, but refused to pay the inflated prices that came along with the "cool factor" of owning a truck. We love nature, and wanted a compact, comfortable truck to take us to the national forests to explore the gravel/service roads where our sedan shouldn't go, as well as handle all kinds of weather, and gardening chores. The Frontier is just wonderful...not to big, very comfortable. I can zip in and out of downtown with no problem; a fabulous sound system. Okay, the armrest could be longer, but the lumbar support is terrific. Forget the Tacoma, it's not even close. There's only one Frontier.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good sound system, lumbar support on passenger side is above average, I like the seat covers, large windshield, it's a perfect all around vehicle without going to big. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After considering a variety of cars to upgrade to from my previous vehicle, I chose the Frontier as it provided a high level of features, great build quality, and is very comfortable to drive both around the city and on long HWY hauls. As a commuter vehicle, the Frontier has all the necessary comforts and features of a comparable sedan while also handling well. However, as I also needed a vehicle that would accommodate the tools and supplies used for home renovation, the Frontier was an easy choice to make as even with the 5ft bed it </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Durability and versatility of the vehicle, interior features and comfort. Cargo track in the tray.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Set out to buy a Ford Ranger 4X4. Ford would not deal but Nissan made me a great deal. The Truck is awesome. Very Strong for a mid size. I need a tight turn radius. No wheel hop with this truck. Full size is way too big. They can't fit between many trees when 4 wheelin' The wheels truly unlock and truly lock when you need it. Very nice ride. Interior is nothing to write about but nice enough. Love the 6 speed. Gas mileage average. I wanted the maneuverability in a mid with good pulling power for my HD trailer. Very nice tires and wheels stock on the Pro4X. Bed Tie down system is awesome. Test drive it, you will see.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very nimble with great power. 6 speed manual is tops.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am quite pleased with this truck. I was open minded towards purchasing any brand and type of truck. I chose the Frontier for several reasons:Better seating position then Tacoma (I am short); Good build quality; Power; (V6) plenty of it with decent fuel economy. Not too big, not too small; perfect size for someone who doesn't live in their truck. Drives very well; confident handling and feel. Don't be fooled, you can't have someone in the back for any long period of time in King Cab </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have just under 3,000 miles so far and just minor problems. I've noticed a timing chain slap while starting every once in a while. Driver's sun visor bounces while driving and in stowed position and falls slightly when against windshield. Speedometer reads 2 miles fast. Brakes have strange hitch only at complete stop and just after acceleration. (Feels like loose wheel lug nuts.) Finish on chrome front bumper not that great. Turning radius too large. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior fit and finish is great. Paint work near perfect. Acceleration is fantastic. Auto transmission, flawless.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the 09 Frontier back in August of 08 and since then I have put 23,000 miles on it so far. It gets really good gas mileage for it's engine size I average about 18 or 19 basicly I fill up when it gets to 1/4 tank and I have driven about 325 miles. It's really smooth on the highway and offroad the handling is second to none. The hill descent feature and hill start assist are really great options to have esp in the winter with snowy conditions. Overall just a great truck that can fit four people comfortably on long trips.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Def the hill descent and hill start features for one then the factory spray on bedliner with utili track. Large towing capacity for a mid size pick up. I can go on an on but it's a great truck.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As a proud/loyal owner of 4 Toyotas and in the market for a mid-sized pick up, it was a given that I was going to purchase a Tacoma. Keeping an open mind, however, I researched and conducted test drives on the Tacoma competition, Frontier Pro 4x in particular. I was blown away. Much quieter ride in the Frontier as well as "tighter" construction vs Tacoma. Bottom line, I am now a "Fronty" convert. Although I have only had a short while, I am very pleased with the purchase--will continue to evaluate and will post updates to review after a few thousand miles (plan an extended trip to the Rockies this summer). Bottom line--check out the Frontiers before you purchase--you'll be glad you did</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sturdy, truck-like construction. 4 wheel-disc brakes, heated leather seats are awesome. With traction package along with 4x4 Pro 4X model, I should be able to go most most out of the way fishing and hunting spots. 10-speaker Rockford Fosgate stereo is much better than the JBL system in my Toyota</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I miss the fuel economy of my old 1993 Mazda B2200 but the smooth, quiet ride and great acceleration on the highway are so much better than the Mazda ever was and I got a great deal. This truck is also fun to drive with very little road noise. It takes a little while to get used to the quick response when turning the steering wheel. I may change my tune if gasoline hits $4.00 per gallon again but right now i'm extremely pleased with my purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought the SE king cab 4x4 a few days ago. I have been a dodge dakota owner the past few years, and this truck is 10 times better. The cab is quiet, the truck is very tight, and very fun to drive. I have also got several positive comments from others about the lokks and design. I am looking forward to many years of service from this wonderful truck. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got this truck after spending the past 5 years driving an Explorer Sport, and I have to say, there's a world of difference. Was challenging finding the PRO-4X in 4wd, but I'm glad I held out for the PRO-4X. Not needing a full size truck, but desiring tough off-rode performance, and comfort, the PRO-4x fits my needs perfectly. The ride is much better than my Explorers, with the 8-way adjustable (and heated) seats being the most comfortable I've experienced personally. I drove 5 hours in it the day I bought it, and never got "tired of the saddle." The Rockford Fosgate sound system is top notch, and the Crew Cab gives me ample room to haul the kids around comfortably. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Utili-trac system. Entire PRO-4x off-road package Bluetooth capabilities.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned 3 Tacoma's. satisfied with all 3, although very pricey and sparse inside. After much research and comparison, I am pleased with decision to buy 2009 Pro 4X, crew cab. Biggest factor, interior and price much better with Nissan. Finally, a comfortable truck with features never found in a truck. Heated leather, 6 disc/MP3, power seats and so on. The best compromise I could find between SUV and truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am quite pleased with this truck. I was open minded towards purchasing any brand and type of truck. I chose the Frontier for several reasons: Good build quality; metal where you normally see plastic and good fit. Smoothest shifting I've ever seen, especially into and out of 4WD. Name brand tires. Power; (V6) plenty of it with decent fuel economy. Not too big, not too small; perfect size for someone who doesn't live in their truck. Drives very well; confident handling and feel. Overall great truck I think. Assembled in USA. Don't be fooled, you can't have someone in the back for any long period of time in King Cab but I'm ok with that. Oil filter a little hard to get to. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power. Utilitrack and bed liner from factory is awesome if you think you'll need it. Size is great. Fantastic transmission and 4WD shifting!</FAVORITE>
