<TEXT>I just took ownership of a 2009 Murano- SL AWD. This is my second Murano previous one was a 2006 SL FWD. At first drive, I actually like this Murano better than the 2006. Though I will miss the adjustable pedals. I like the new dash, a little more traditional than the 2006. quality is excellent! The Bose system is better in the 2009 than the 2006. THis is very important to me, I'm in the profession.THe 2009 is way less muddy sounding, crisper highs. Driving feels even better, and I loved the 2006. I never had mechanical issues with the first, I hope the second is just as good, if not better. Great job, Nissan.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride, better quality interior, visibility is fine with the rear camera, no complaints yet. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a 2005 Murano and loved it. After test driving the 2009, I decided to trade the old one. The 2009 is definitely more refined than my 2005. However, the 2009 has been riddled with squeaks, creaks and rattles since delivery. It has been off the road for almost a month in total as the dealer has tried to repair it. After replacing almost all plastic pieces in the interior of the vehicle, there is now an issue with how the body panels were assembled at the factory. Nissan is not clear yet how to fix this issue. It likely will involve body work, re- welding the panels and inserting some type of insulation to prevent rubbing during body flex. Stay tuned. Check other blogs for similar posts</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The features are outstanding. I would not have purchased any other vehicle (not knowing the trouble that would come from it). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Following back surgery, I needed to replace my beloved Lexus ES 350 and I finally decided on the 09 Murano. I was leaning towards the Lexus RX 350 but after spending some time with the Murano, I couldn't justify paying an extra $8k - $10k. This was my first Nissan and for a non-luxury brand, I've been very impressed with the car. The build quality is great and the ride is very smooth. The interior is well crafted and very quiet. With the possible exception of the grill, the exterior styling is very handsome, as well. If you're in the market for a crossover/mid-sized SUV (luxury brand or otherwise), the Murano should be near the top of your list.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth ride and acceleration (CVT), comfortable seating, backup camera, appearance and styling. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Read over hundred editor/customer reviews on the Murano. Read and drove all the usual suspect comparisons. It came down to the CX9 (very good suv) but for our needs it was too big. We liked the Murano's size and we didn't require a huge amount of storage space. We use this as an everyday commuter vehicle and staying within the speed limits get about 23miles per gallon highway. The Murano does everything well but not great. Its certainly not a luxury suv, sporty or hockey mom suv but it does all those things adequately. While some decry CVT we found it to be one of the Muranos stronger points. We hope Nissan does not add a 3rd seat as there is stil a market place for a true mid-size suv.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Touch screen is very good. Once programmed the navi system and directions are very straightforward, helpful and informational. Remote power hatch.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love my new Murano! I got the S AWD with the convenience pkg. in glacier pearl. It is everything I had hoped for. Nice to drive and looks good on the road. Looked at the Toyota Rav4 and Chevy Equinox, the Murano out shines the others by far! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2004 Nissan Murano. It was an excelent car but I decided to change it for a new one. I looked at others SUV from different brands like Lexus RX350, Volvo XC60, Mazda CX-7, and Audi Q5. I tested all of them(excellent SUVs)and The Murano SL 360 was the winner. For $30,000 (you can get it at this price) you get a lot of excellent features paying less money than the others brands I mentioned before (except CX-7 which is inferior in quality) The Murano has an excellent interior design with blue tooth, leather, rear view camera, 6 cds charge, Ipod conexion, moonroof, etc. The exterior design is stunning. Acceleration and stability are amazing. Try it you will enjoy it. I think Nissan is Quality</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the car one month ago as a lease. Coming from a 2006 VW Passat. The Nissan does everything effortlessly. It accelerates like smooth butter. It has plenty of power and is as smooth as a Cadillac DTS, but has more of a sport feel when you need it to. It is not a huge vehicle but your seating position is nice and high and you have a commanding view of the road. The VW Passat is a great car and is underated when it comes to value and performance. That being said I feel the same about the Nissan. Great car, good price. The only thing I can find to complain about is the leather on the door feels cheap and scratches easily and the storage is somewhat small. Buy it you will like it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Silky smooth acceleration. Rides like a much more expensive car. The passenger room is amazing. I am six foot and 300 pounds and this car has more than enough room. Controls are easy to use and the seating position and comfort are top notch. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have been toyota/Lexus people for going on 30 years now, and have had excellent luck with all the differing vehicles. When it came time to trade in our RX330, we did a lot of research, driving and evaluating of the Crossover offerings. The new RX left us cold, Lexus just wasn't daring enough, and it's rather bland. We tried the Venza, the Q5, and the Mazda's, all of which left us unimpressed. A friend suggested we try the new Murano - easily competitive with the RX, has an unforgettable exterior, and the interior is superbly screwed together. The Murano certainly rivels the Lexus RX for quite and luxury. So far, we are very impressed with the ride and handling.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the amenities, the Tch package is great, the back-up camera is definitely class leading, and the Nav system is very well done as is the voice recognition.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I researched for over 6 months and kept coming back to the Murano. It's classy, yet very fun to drive. I can't believe how quiet and comfortable she is. I have lower-back pain - the power lumbar support is incredible. I've had her for a week and I've already received many compliments. The dual- panel moonroof is my favorite feature. It just feels so open and bright. I also love the back-up camera - it's a must in this vehicle as the rear view isn't all that great. I've been averaging 24 miles/gallon on the highway, and have been pretty impressed with MPG so far. I got it in Merlot with Beige interior and I love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dual-panel moonroof, Bluetooth (how did I live without that before?), back- up camera, comfortable seats, Bose sound system, bright headlights, quick AC, heated seats, stylish looks. :-)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am a great advocate of the Nissan Murano. Been driving one since 2003 and have no performance or reliability issues with the car. However I was disappointed when I purchased my 2009 SL and I could not get an iPod integration kit installed or a remote start kit installed from Nissan. I would assume these are common accessories today, especially the iPod. Just disappointed in Nissan's decision to exclude their mid range Murano owners.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We recently bought the LE with dual moon-roofs, after owning a Durango for 9 years. When looking at prospective cars, 3 things were imperative... driver side room (I am 6'6) with plenty of cargo area (3 dogs and kayaks), dependability and mpg. I focused on the Murano, CRV, Pilot and Highlander. Based on research and without test driving, I was fairly certain I would be purchasing a CRV or a Highlander. I ended up test driving the Murano and was sold immediately. It was the most comfortable, spacious, ergonomic and moderately priced when factoring mpg. I originally was thinking the SL model would be my choice. But after driving the LE, I was willing to spend the extra $$$.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roominess and leg room is perfect for a large driver, the interior is luxurious, the tech features are awesome including iPod interface (clutch!) and an amazing Bose system, rear video camera, power seats and leather are beyond 5 star, bluetooth and the exterior's design is aggressive and unique. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I fell in love with the 2007 Murano, and when read about the 2009 I waited 3 months to purchase the new sleek 2009. I even paid full MSRP to get the right color and style I wanted. But it has been one service visit after another. 2 recalls, 1 for reprogramming the airbags, and 1 for the repairing the clock. This last visit, there seems to be a air leak that is a known issue in Muranos, but since the car is so new, the parts to replace are not yet being manufactured, so the service department returned my car and asked me to wait for the recall notice to fix. How disappointing. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Murano for just about 1.5 months and have been very happy with the handling and performance. Easy to drive, park, turn sharply. Good pick up. Easy to put down back seats for hauling. Comfortable ride. Plenty of leg and head room in front and back seat. My first SUV, so a little difficult to judge distance in front and back. Slight limits on visibility. I like the 6 CD changer and easy plug in for iPod. Overall - very pleased with vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove Nissans (Datsuns) in the 1970s then quit - until this year. Totaled my Saturn Aura and got a Murano for short term rental. It is now a long term ownership proposition. This car has it all in looks, handling, ride, quality, and performance. VALUE!! That was the reason I bought the Saturn, but the Murano defines the word (please see dictionary). Had to wait 2 months to get my tinted bronze metallic (the color they use in all the sales ads on TV and print media) but well worth it. Most buyers are looking to drive off the lot and I feel exclusive in my color choice having yet to see another. Marital discord has thus arisen as my wife wants this car BAD!! Love @ 1st drive guaranteed!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Spent several months reseraching every other CUV/SUV on the market and the 2009 Murano continually popped up near the top of every criteria list. I quickly uncovered that this vehicle should not be compared to the Mazda CX- 7, Ford Edge, Toyota Highlander, etc., but rather the Lexus RX, Acura RDX/MDX, BMW X3/X5, etc. For the money, the performance, amenities, and overall driving experience that Nissan offers in the Murano cannot be beat in its class. I went with the LE because it offers everything, I would highly recommend the navigation option (no regrets). After a month of ownership and 2000 miles, I am still impressed by the ride quality and everything that this vehicle offers. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth and powerful VQ 3.5 V6 and CVT combo (fantastic ride quality). INtelligent key, nav, Bluetooth, power- everything, and all the other great technology packed in this thing. Others: Interior layout, comfort features, 20" wheels, Bose sound system, safety features. Overall build quality!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Unbelievable value and more comfortable than my Lexus RX. Also, there's no shift shock so you pick up speed very quickly. The rear seats recline and have alot of leg room. The illumated gauges and the chrome interior finish have a sports car feel. Go with the front wheel drive version instead of AWD and save money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded a 2007 Toyota Camry SE-V6 for this Murano LE in April and could not be happier! Great styling, excellent performance, fine handling (for an SUV) and decent fuel economy... what more could I ask for? OK, I could ask for more, but then I would have to purchase a new FX-50 and spend an extra $15K or more!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Nice car in black with 20 inch wheels. Very plush interior and very much not a german built interior, which is good for a change. We chose this over the loaded FX35 even though within $10 of the payment we have with Murano. The Murano has a wondefully smooth powertrain with terrific town and highway power thanks to the VQ 3.5. The immediate availability of torque via the CVT by pressing the gas at any rpm is very impressive and very uneventful without gear changes. The car has superb output even on regular gas. Many 300hp SUVs don't have the grunt of this car. We just came out of a VW Toaureg. While not as solid a structure, it does shed about 650 pounds from the "egg". </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear seat release and return, rearview camera, high end Bose 9 speaker stereo, harddrive space, Gen II CVT, VQ 3.5, leather quality, rear seat room, Dash layout even though very unique, instumentation lighting, wheels.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Since 1970, have driven or owned almost every Nissan-Datsun product ever built. The '09 Murano is a first for me and tho experience is yet short, this is probably about as good as any driving experience is ever going to get for present industry standards, period. Relentless comparisons and long time experience keeps me coming back to Nissan. Note some who complain about body roll -- those should realize that Nissan could provide perfectly flat cornering, but then a lot of weak or inexperienced drivers would find out (upside down in the ditch), that tires do not stay permanently glued to the pavement. Some body roll lets you know that you are approaching the adhesion limits of your tires. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Just a wonderfully well refined and balanced arrangement of looks, power & creature comforts. Spectacularly solid & confidence-inspiring feel on the road. Keyless, push-button start a nice touch. Nissan designers and engineers worked overtime on this fine piece of work. Won't find better!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Leaving my 2005 Pathfinder for the 2009 Murano was tough for me - still is. In an effort to reduce my "carbon footprint" and experience a much smoother, luxury-like ride, I just leased a new Murano S AWD. Nissan did a phenomenal job upgrading from the 2007 model. The CVT is a dream to drive with and the handling is something I never thought I'd experience in an SUV. The only downsides for me: recommended use of premium gas and the sub-par stereo system offered in the S model. For those of us who can't afford the SL or LE, it'd be nice to have the choice in the S model of upgrading to the Bose stereo system. All in all, an amazing vehicle-just need more time to get used to the size downgrade.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have always had full size pick ups. Traded in my 07 Tundra for the Murano. Love the comfort, power and handling. Gas mileage a little disappointing so far (only about 18mph). Poor visibility. Very smooth accelaration. Was unwilling to pay for unwanted features just to get leather so had put in after (better quality then factory anyway). Very happy so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just picked up my 2009 Murano. I had a 2005 and loved it. But there's no comparison between the 2 cars. The styling on the 2009 is much better as is the interior. There's more pop in this one, the ride is quiet and smooth. Mine has the tech, nav, prem, leather and moonroof options. I test drove other cars but came back to the Murano. If you're looking for a mid-size suv that rides like a car you'll love the Murano. If you like listening to music you'll love the Bose system. Do yourself a favor and test drive this SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, ride, and all the toys. The backup camera is great as is the nav and boise system. The interior is fantastic and the ride is so smooth and quiet You step on the gas and VOOOOM off you go. The power lift gate and easy folding back seats are great too. So is the pop up bag holder.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Diligent research on the net and a few visits to dealerships resulted in my purchase of the 09 Nissan Murano. The car is put together well. Leather interior is incredible. Driver seat could double as a ez chair in your house. It is very quiet. Performance is spectacular. The v6 with CVT is breath taking. Instruments and controls are all easy to see, read and use. The front console screams 'LOOK AT ME!' at night. Very attractive. Fun and responsive to drive. Rides and feels nicer than vehicles I have used that cost twice as much. Outstanding vehicle. Absolutely ZERO "buyer's remorse".</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Intelligent Key is worth EVERY dime. I thought it was more of a gimmick at first. NEVER needing to take the key out of my pocket is great! Color back up camera with guidance info is especially nice aswell. Powerlift gate is gold too! (works with Intelligent Key)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought a 2009 LE on 4-1-09 and sold it on 5-15-08 I had a jerking/vibration at speed of 40 - 60 and they were giving me the run around that it was the gas. They wanted me to run 4 tanks for 93 octane this would fix the problem. Well it made NO difference. If you are thinking about buying one of these I would make sure that you do a hell of a good test drive, overnight drive at different speeds and on different roads. Selling it was the best thing for me to do to deal with it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>When my lease on my '04 Murano expired I went to lease a new '09, but was surprised with the significantly higher lease payment. After driving many competitors (MDX, RDX, RX350, Edge, RAV4, Pilot, FX) I still came back to the Murano. Compared to the previous model the '09 offers a more comfortable seat along with a smoother ride. There seems to be plenty of power, but I notice a slight lag off the line compared to my older Murano (it may just be something I have to get used to). Nissan has another winner on its hands!</TEXT>

<TEXT>All the luxury items make this a great crossover. Ride is very smooth as you'd expect from a luxury sedan, and steering is soft - no feel of the road while you float along. Plenty of power at your disposal when you need it. However, when you are going slow (under 30) with minimum gas pedal pressure, you can feel the CVT seeking the best gear ratio. Car is very roomy front and back for when you have 5 adults to carry.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power fold-down back seats with a second set of switches at the tailgate. Double moon roof allows plenty of light. Bluetooth phone system is a must given number of states and towns passing cell phone laws. Absolutely love the totally keyless operation - never take the key fob out of your pocket!</FAVORITE>

The exterior styling had been my initial attraction but the cft transmission had been the putoff. Boy was I wrong. This murano drives like an infiniti/Lexus. Soft ride with lots of pep and no hesitation. Flying on the interstate it glided effortlessly thru rush hour, dead quiet to wind & traffic noise. I hated to park it it was such fun.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After much research and test drives of the vehicles in this class, my wife and I decided on the new 2009 Nissan Murano. We traded in a 2006 Pontiac Torrent and this was a definite upgrade. We are both impressed with the quality of the Murano inside and out. The interior is very luxurious and well thought out. The seats are very comfortable, and every driver should be able to find a good driving position. We traveled 200 miles to a business meeting and did not want to get out of the car. We purchased the SL model FWD with everything but the navigation package. Driving in town or at highway speed, the car is extremely quiet and comfortable. We feel we made a wise choice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The CVT transmission and engine are smooth and powerful. Power liftgate is very handy. Super Bose sound system and the XM radio is nice. The backup camera is a big plus. The leather seats and the whole interior of the car looks like something costing $1,000's more.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this vehicle. This is my third Nissan; however, my previous car was a Volkswagen and I didn't realize how much I missed Nissan until I drove the Murano. The '09 interior is a vast upgrade over previous models. So long as you don't mind the lack of a third row seat (which I don't) then this is quite possibly the best "CUV"/SUV on the market for the price. It is a perfect blend of power, comfort and style. The front-end styling is much more appealing than in previous versions.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Previously had BMW's. Still have one. Needed more cargo space but full size SUVs just too large for me so crossovers got my attention. I researched & drove the Lexus, BMW, Acura, Infiniti crossovers then just stumbled across the Murano on the web, read up on them & had 2 test drives. Decided not to throw money away on other vehicles that were not as good as the Murano when it came to features, power, driving pleasure, and comfort. Got the tech, premium, leather, & dual moonroof options. Already had a portable nav system so passed on theirs. After 1,500 miles I am very happy with the car. Makes for a relaxing commute. Getting 20-21 mpg in rush hour/city driving. Nissan got this one right!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Backup camera, leather, power options, sound system, powertrain, dual moonroof, good handling and fit & finish. Feels solid. Very responsive engine, road noise much quieter than I anticipated. Great backseat room and nice storage areas located thru the cabin.</FAVORITE>

Having never owned a Nissan before, only Toyotas, I was a bit concerned but this vehicle is great. It is much more technology advanced than the Lexus. I find the Murano's seats are great. Not hard whatsoever. The fuel economy is great. Getting 20 mpg city and 28 mpg highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Drove several crossover/SUVs, including the RAV 4, Ford Edge, Mazda CX7 and CX9. The Murano was the quietest, most smooth riding and best equipped of the bunch. The auto climate control is better than in any of the luxury cars I have owned. I like the spaciousness of the interior. The smoothness and power of the acceleration is really nice. My major complaint is the front seat. It is extremely hard and the front seat cushion does not adjust independently from the seat back. The seat cushion has a very angled upward tilt, to the point of cutting off leg circulation. (I am 5'4" and this may be the reason) I am hoping with time the seat may soften up a bit. Good price for so many features.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this to replace an unreliable minivan. Knew this was the one for me at first drive (drove highlander, RAV4, enclave, pilot). Great interior, unbelievably comfortable leather seats and driving position, great a/c, roomy interior, and nice Bose sound system. The ride is smooth, quiet, firm and responsive. There is mild body lean on turns.The power lift gate is on the slow side.Some blind spots, but fine. My kids love it because they don't get car sick in it! I only have 400 miles on it running about 20 mpg. The vehicle recommends premium fuel (the manual says 87 octane min) which can be costly with today's gas prices. The fuel tank is large though, maybe longer time between fill-ups.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently bought the '09 Murano after religiously researching all the vehicles in the category. I found the Murano to stand out from the rest in many ways. At first glance the vehicle just does not look like its competition. (Many of them all look alike.) The inside is very nice. The leather seats are incredibly comfortable. Controls are all easy to reach, instrument cluster is nicely arranged. The engine performance is great. Rides very quiet and very responsive. Power life gate is great, very handy. Back up camera is great, much more useful than I thought it would be. Aimable headlights are very bright. The orange light over head creates a soft glow at night. Awesome car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power liftgate. Keyless entry and start. (never need to take the keys out of your pocket!) Backup camera, dual moon roof. Leather interior is nicely done and very comfortable. Various display options on LCD screen. CVT accelerates like a rocket, very smooth. Many, many more.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Only one month ago, my wife and I just bought the 2009 Murano with full loaded options. We are so impressed with this vehicle. The interior looks no less then any other crossover luxury AWD like Lexus or Infiniti, the exterior looks so rock and handsome, its performances are superior with a smooth traction control. My wife and I, we both are Infiniti lovers, but this time we would rather choose this Murano instead of the Infiniti FX or the new EX just came out this year.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We tested the 2008 Toyota Highlander, Mazda CX-9, Hyundai Veracruz and others and this one was the best. Feel really good about our decision. Rides like a dream. Very quiet and unbelievable comfort. Power is great with the CVT. We got the top of the line with everything except the DVD player for the back, and are glad we did. The interior is great and feels very luxurious. Still learning all the features,but so far they are fairly easy to get familiar with and we love them all. I really like the heated front and rear seats in the LE.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had no intentions of replacing my ?04, paid-for, Murano with an ?09. But, curiosity got to me, so I went to the dealership & drove one. Within minutes, I was buying. The previous Murano was fantastic ? a well-built, great looking SUV with plenty of neat features for a reasonable cost. The ?09 improves on virtually every aspect of the previous version: better build, more power, way more features ? for less! For looks, I like this one better now, but all-in- all, the first gen was better looking for its time. If you?re considering a Murano: a) drive it, b) ask others who own one, c) do a comparison. This vehicle truly holds its own when compared to vehicles costing $10K more,</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Better build & materials. Technology: rear-view camera, Bluetooth, key-free system, dual-moonroofs, Xenon, power tailgate, Bose w/ XM & MP3, smoothness & speed.

<TEXT>Picked up my 2009 SL AWD today, and man is it fun to drive. It has every option you can get on the SL (i have the dual panel moonroof instead of the DVD). The wife loves the dual panel moonroof, I love the navigation and the bluetooth. The start of the engine is a nice growl, and the rearview camera will start your journey out the right way. The turning radius is great, and the handling of the sterring wheel is fantastic. The ride truly is smooth, even over bumps and road imperfections, and you will find yourself well over the speed limit if you don't monitor your speed. The CVT truly is quite nice once you get used to it. Braking is safe and quick.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my 09 SL for a week now and while I am very pleased with how it drives and handles, it has the most uncomfortable seats I have had. Besides poor alignment, even with power seats they are rock hard! If you ever have had had back issues, I would really take a 2nd look at this before your purchase and consider a more level seat. The design is very poor for lower back support. Also there are numerous blind spots that I suppose can be adjusted to. It's a shame because it's a very cool car otherwise</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had a Nissan Pathfinder traded it in for a Murano because Pathfinders are too big now. Feel really good about my decision. 2009 model looks really slick exterior and interior. VERY comfortable for a larger guy like me 6'3 200lb. Rides like a dream. Was originally looking at Mazda CX-7. CX-7 would have been slightly less $ but the difference is large. Very quiet ride and unbelievable comfort. Love the CVT. I go the leather interior with are very soft and comfy, especially when compared with its competitors. Look and feel of inside and outside as good if not better than some much more pricey Acura, Lexus, BMW models I looked at (briefly) for $10,000 less.</TEXT>

<TEXT>1st time Nissan buyer, test-drove Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander but liked the Murano best (I like the smaller size, I don't need 3rd row). Love this car so far, fit and finish / styling are top notch. Took it to the mountains to go skiing this past weekend and it did great, but not much snow or ice to challenge AWD on yet. Leather is comfortable, moonroof is fun. Am averaging about 19-20 mpg so far in mostly city driving but only 500+ miles on it so far. Very quiet, smoother ride than I expected from SUV. I was a bit worried about buying a Nissan due to their hit or miss reliability but am hoping it is above average like '07 design. I also hope crash test ratings come thru clean.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car! I purchased mine 03/08/08 and so far put about 1200 miles on it and what can I say, every time I'm in it, I enjoy it every second. For me one of the important things is the handling and agility and I'd say it's been great, pretty much BMW-like. Steering and braking feel is excellent. I am getting roughly 21.5 MPG in mixed driving. It's been mentioned that you can't listen the music when car is off, but you just should try to press Start button without pressing brake pedal and it will work without engine being on. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I used to drive a Volvo V70. I considered a Lexus RX, Acura RDX and Infiniti FX. This had the best combination of drivability (also fun to drive) and comfort. Unfortunately, its cargo area is smaller than other premium SUVs. Seating, however, is very comfortable for four or five adults. Good, confident handling with a firm, but smooth and quiet ride. Fast acceleration. It is easy to drive around the city; although, the gas mileage could be better. Road imperfections, including potholes, are well-handled. Terrific at high speeds on the highway, very stable with reasonable gas mileage. Speed-sensitive steering works very well. </TEXT>

I liked the previous 07 Murano in the past and was waiting for redesign for about a year and Nissan did not disappoint me. I like the handling of this car a lot. I haven't driven BMW X5 which considered to be one of the best sportier handling SUVs, but Murano handles very well and secure, body lean is very little and steering and break feel is great. Interior space is just perfect for me, even it is a little smaller then 07 model. Exterior is still growing on me and I think in a year or so everybody will be talking how good looking this car is.</TEXT>

I have black leather, it is very sharp looking and very comfortable for a big guy. Plenty of space. The ride and handling are extremely smooth! Very little bodyroll (as compared to other midsize SUVs). The transmission is perfect, easy power when you need to pass. Brakes are also very good. Driving on snow was a breeze. Exterior styling is ok nothing great, you will get plenty of looks and questions. I recommend this SUV to everyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great SUV. It is tremendously smooth and it has a ton of power. It certainly ranks up there with all the other luxury SUVs out there without being priced as high. The interior is roomy and comfy while the exterior is just flat out hot. Love the fact that it has a back up camera without actually purchasing the navigation. Push button start is nice but I don't like the fact that I can't listen to my music after it is off. The traditional turn key allowed me listen to my music even with the car off as I can turn the key about three forth of the way. Also wished the aux input was not located behind the center console. Can't comment on the fuel economy as my Murano still needs to break in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We shopped through all of the crossovers and were most impressed initially with the room and options on the Murano. It drives very nicely and if you are not careful you will find yourself at 80 mph on the highway without realizing it. It is quiet and comfortable. I am 6'4" tall and I have plenty of room in the front and back seats. The acceleration is above average for the CUVs we tested and the vehicle handles well.

<TEXT>I have had this car for about 3 weeks now and am extremely happy with my decision to get it. The 09 is so much better looking than the 07s I looked at. The interior in particular is superb in the leather and aluminum trim. I prefer the SL trim to the wood of the LE. On 2 long drives (500 mile round trips) I have gotten close to 26 MPG which I think is good for a care of this size and engine capacity. I plan on keeping this one for a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a 2005 Nissan Pathfinder LE for this 'Mo and we love it! Very nicely detailed inside and out, handles much better than my Pathfinder. Definitely better gas mileage than the PF even though the Murano seems to be more peppy. Must be the extra HP for this year. We drove the 2007 and the '09 is a much better car: more power, smoother CVT, noticeably quieter and handled better too. Back seats are mucho better than the PF too--hated them on the PF for being so uncomfortable. I'm glad that Nissan didn't cave in and put in a 3rd row seat to mess up the back cargo area. Good on them for holding their ground. Buy it--you won't be disappointed!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first midsize suv. This car is for my wife but I get a great joy driving it. Fuel economy is excellent in my opinion for the size motor and power. On a long trip I set cruise at different speeds for 1/2 hr at a time. 60 mph gave an average of 30 mpg while cruising on the back roads. At 80 mph on the interstate average mpg was 22.8. This will improve as the car gets broken in. Every thing about this car is excellent. It is very quite on the highway and comfortable for long trips. Safety in crash testing gave the Murano the highest rating of 9 midsize SUVs tested. Safety, looks, comfort, value, an unbeatable combination.</TEXT>

My 6'8" friend has said he had never been able to ride comfortably in a back seat before riding in my Murano. The intellikey system is too cool. It has bluetooth capabilities, built in XM radio, power lift gate, xenon headlights, and so many more awesome features.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just traded my 2004 350Z for this vehicle. Strange choice? Hardly. Exterior: it still has the same stylish looks as previous models except the grille-work, which gives it an almost "storm-trooper" facade which is head turning. Interior: smooth clean lines continue to demonstrate that Nissan has not gone away from its earlier models. Very easy to handle all dash displays and the interior cabin is spacious. Driving: power to burn, tight steering radius, and easier than you might think to park. There is some body roll when cornering (maybe I drive too fast). It drives like a car and with the added horsepower you feel like you can control any driving situation. Best buy for sure. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded our '03 Murano SL for an '09 LE. Only the LE has the memory seats which were part of the leather package on the old SL. The new Murano has a much more luxurious feeling interior with some nice new features such as dual moonroof, power liftgate, backup camera, intelikey and bluetooth with voice dialing. The suspension and CVT seem improved a little. Minor gripes are that the outside temp display has been switched from the center display to the drivers instrument panel and the driver's seat cushion is not independently tiltable. This is the first time that my wife and I have bought the same model vehicle again, so clearly we are happy with the Murano and like the new one even better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In March, I traded my 05 Altima & 05 Pathfinder on my Murano. In June, we drove from Louisiana to Utah on vacation.Total trip was 4,500 miles. Averaged 24.5 mpg.Handled the mountain roads like a sports car. The overdrive switch worked well coming down the mountains.The CVT was smooth, even in the mountains. Passed through a terrible storm in Texas. Handled the wind and water puddles well. Have made similar trips out west in a Tahoe, Yukon, Cherokee and my Pathfinder. Gave up a little storage space , but this car out performed them all. Drove 12 to 14 hours some days. Very comfortable. Love this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the Nissan Murano after looking at lots of other Crossovers. Almost got the SL with the 360 package, but am so happy I got the LE. I previously drove a 99 Nissan Altima and never had a problem with it, so another Nissan was a big draw for me. The only issue I had was with the XMradio. Some wiring issue prevented XM from showing up. It took the dealer a while to figure it out. Works like a charm now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Recently turned in our 2005 Murano. My wife actually cried in the salesman's room when we turned in her 2005 leased murano. That car was the best ever. Never a bad moment with the exception for a coil going bad, and the dealership kept for 5 weeks trying to find the culprit. They gave us a loaner which says loads for them. Purchased a new Murano S series and am impressed to the utmost. Had leather seats installed and it looks and rides fantastic. Great acceleration and ride. Not many of the bells and whistles on this one but still a fantastic vehicle. Anyone who is considering one should look at the Murano. Compared it to the others and still came back to the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased my second Murano. My first one was a 2004. I really enjoyed owning the 2004, but, when I drove the 2009 it was a whole new diving experience. The 2009 has more stability at higher speeds. The engine and the transmission work well together. The ride is much smoother. The sound system sounds much better with the added speakers. Also the instrument panel is less cluttered and easier to work with. The 2009 Murano is the type of car that makes you take the long way home. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I got an 09 le murano, I love the the way it handles and how comfortable it is. The thing i dont like is how in the winter when it snows the rims always get snow building up and makes it shake or ride ruff down the road. I know all rims do that after alot of snow but not everytime it snows. Another thing is my driver door has frozen shut on me twice from just he slush splashing up. I dont know if i got a bad seal or what? other then that i love it! Where do u get new tires i cant find any store that carries 235/55/20? </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was smitten with the Murano's good looks and equally good reputation. It hasn't lived up to my expectations. There is a rattling at the back of the vehicle (I think it's the liftgate) that the dealer hasn't been able to fix in two tries. There is also a buzzing sound that comes from the center control stack of instruments. This makes my new car a constant source of annoyance. There was an electrical problem with a window that was fixed on my first repair visit. I'd do anything to get out from under this car but it would be too expensive to do. I'm also not pleased with my mileage, just barely 18 mpg for hiway and city driving (about 50-50). Don't get suckered in by the sharp looks!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Waited awhile to write in review but first to clarify a couple things from others reviews... memory seats are available(LE model) & you don't have to use premium gas. I definitely agree with the folks that say this is a poor mans Lexus RX! What sold me: It is super quiet inside, very comfortable (I'm 6'2"), roomy front & back, all the goodies like intelligent key, backup camera, etc. I actually did little research on this vehicle before testing it out but once I drove it, it had my attention. I bought SL and added Leather, Tech, Performance Pkgs (& moonroof)... it saved me $3-$4k from buying LE and only diff is nav system, memory seats, rear-heated seats, ipod hookup... not worth 3k to me!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove the Maxda CX-7 and even though it has the 4 cylinder turbo, I think the Murano has just as much "pick up" without the turbo. Mine has heated leather seats which I highly recommend. I love the stability control and the all wheel drive. I live where it gets about 600 inches of snow in the winter and the snow doesn't even phase it! It's quieter than the Mazda and the ride is more cushie with the Murano. I did A TON of research and gave many other makes a chance, but I am SO glad that I got the Murano. I love it!The LE has all the bells&whistles but if you can't afford that, the S is still a great car! Cheers!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Leased RX 330 + RX 350 for the last six years. Spent last two months testing all brands to try and find something better for less $$. Low road noise important - I have hearing damage. Tried everything to $50,000,and the Murano and the TIGUAN were the two most quiet cars using decibel meter on common stretch of highway at 60 MPH measured at drivers left ear and middle of car interior. Mercedes and BMW were both louder by 2-3 db and worse gas mileage. Murano quiet as the Lexus identical db stats even with LE 20 inch wheels. Rented SL for 2 weeks louder than LE by 1 db! MPG 1 less than Lexus. Venza 4 db louder! 2010 RX530 NOT quieter than previous year. Murano lease 2/3 $ Lexus - loaded to max!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet Quiet Quiet seats very comfortable iPhone cable and the Bluetooth is BETTER than Lexus - no strange buzzing in Murano bluetooth phone connection.

<TEXT>I am about to buy the LE model. I read other reviews about the slight bouncy quality on the Murano while driving city streets and am happy to say I experienced this myself when driving the SL but not the LE. This is due to the 20inch tires on the LE I believe. The ride on the LE is posh, luxurious and the car handles and drives very nicely and smoothly. I am excited to pick up the car tomorrow. I compared this to the Acura RDX and MDX, the Audi Q5 and the Volkswagen TIguan and Touareg, but found the Murano to the best in terms of ride comfort and lowest road/wind noise. Very happy buyer. I came from a Mercedes ML 350, so its not as luxurious as the ML, but best offers value for money!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My husband and I looked for a new vehicle for two years. We test drove almost every brand out there and many, many models. When the 2009 Murano made it's debut, I was instantly mesmerized and I knew I needed to test drive this crossover. Our first test drive was unbelievable - I really couldn't believe how comfortable, stylish, and sporty. I knew as soon as my hubby test drove, he was sold. The Murano is exceptional in every single way. I think other brands need to open their eyes (including Acura, which was on the top of my list BEFORE I found the Murano). If you want a top of the line car that is sporty and drips luxury, this is it - you've arrived.</TEXT>

<TEXT>On my way to sign the paperwork on another SUV, I decided to stop in and checkout the Rogue, - too small - salesman suggested the Murano and I test drove it - just because. I never made it to the other dealership and bought it right then. I have always driven Toyota and Honda but the Murano was much nicer and had many standard options. I have had the Murano for a month and I look for reasons to drive. Comfort, handling and the interior will keep me in this SUV for a while. The other SUV's I was considering, Toyota Highlander (wife has one), Subaru Tribeca, and the Hyundai Santa Fe. For better gas mileage use premium fuel and switch to full synthetic oil (Mobile 1). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Most comfortable vehicle I have ever owned....and I have back problems. Power is very good (with premium gas). Good value - Standard options make my White Toyota Camry look like a block of tofu. Gas mileage same as my wife's 4 cyl 2007 Highlander - so far. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After months of careful research and test driving other vehicles, I finally decided on the Murano. While the vehicle has so many great qualities, including a fantastic interior, comfortable seats, and great ergonomics, I wish I had taken a bit more of an extensive test drive in the vehicle I took home. While the vehicle isolates road "bumps" my particular example has this sort of undulating bouncy character to it which is especially noticeable on surface streets. It is smoothed out somewhat at speed on the freeway but is still noticeable. Anyway, it is a bit annoying to say the least and definitely is detracting from the excitement that should come with a new care. Take a long test drive!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Back up camera, heated seats, roomy second row, Bose sound system. I likely wouldn't buy again given the bouncy ride quality that was painfully obvious from the first ride home. If AWD needed, I would look more closely at the new Forester, or the EX35 AWD.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned my Murano LE since early January and I absolutely love it. I have previously driven a Ford Explorer and a Jeep Grand Cherokee. Nothing compares to the smooth, quiet and luxurious ride of the Murano. The dashboard is arranged perfectly and the console has two cup holders plus a very useful oblong holder that is perfect to hold the cell phone open while using the Bluetooth, or any other item that you might need in a hurry. This car has it all- easy to pull down rear seats, lots of room in the back,auto lift gate is wonderful, the 6 cyl. engine has incredible power on the highway,especially for merging, and definitely is more powerful than my Jeep V-8 ever was!

Navagation system awesome, radio great with recording feature. Ride very good but noisy with moon roof open. I miss the memory seat that Nissan decided to remove from the "09--had it in the '03. Don't understand that decision? Overall, very satisfied, would highly recommend. I can fit 4 sets of golf clubs across the back of trunk.

<TEXT>We traded in a Lexus RX a year ago for a Honda CRV, and have missed the comfort. Went shopping and found the SL more comfortable and quiet than the new RX for $10K less. Looked at the Edge as well but it just wasn't refined enough - the power lift gate support looked like it was just added - oh wait, it was, whereas the Murano had the lift designed into the upper support - nice touch. MPG could/should be better, only getting around 19-20 combined. Only have 2k miles so can't attest to reliability. My last Frontier was excellent.

The car like handling is even better and so are all the options. The Murano is just plain fun to drive. You almost forget it is an SUV. And the gas mileage is not bad. There is plenty of spunk too delivered through a smooth CVT that is also an improvement. The spunk though comes at a price - premium fuel.

<TEXT>To quote the food critic guy on Top Chef, this car is like Tom Cruise's performance on Tropic Thunder, an unexpected treat. My current mileage is a little under 900 miles after one month + 2 weeks of driving. No problems at all. Once I reached break in mileage (1500), I'll stop babying it and see what it can really do. Dealer wanted me to go for the S AWD for saving $$$ and I didn't need the extras that came with the SL. He was right. The car is sweet and gets a few looks. The factory stereo is OK but to get the Bose, had to go with Premium Pkg on the SL. Some sliding on turns. Front pillars are distracting. Will not disappoint. You get a lot for your money. Quiet.

<TEXT>Overall, this is a fine vehicle that has, in my opinion, two design faults. The navigation screen needs to face the driver more and be more protected from the sun as on the 09 Maxima. The navigation screen is almost worthless when the sun is at certain angles. The second fault is with the dual moon roof which is also on the 09 Maxima equipped with the premium package. With no moon roof wind deflector presently available, this vehicle is, with out a doubt, the noisiest vehicle I have ever owned or had the opportunity to ride in my 60+ years. (My moon roof comment only applies to models equipped with a dual moon roof.) I have contacted Nissan about the problem, but that was a waste of time. </TEXT>

The technology is well done particularly the dashboard layout. Fit, finish and overall construction is excellent. The 20" wheels make the LE the only Murano to buy and everyone comments how great the Murano looks. The only glitch is the O/D button. It is in a bad location - it is too easy to bump while turning on the heated seats or reaching into the center console in front of the shifter.</TEXT>

I don't see why anyone would pay the premium for an FX35. The only things I might nitpick on are that all four windows should be one-touch, the steering wheel on a loaded SL should be power, and with all the great stereo technology there should be an iPod connector. Also, the dual moonroof for its size should slide open further. Nevertheless, this is the one to put on the top of your list.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My last SUV was the Lexus RX. You must remember it is the last generation Toyota Highlander. The Murano is light years ahead in every way. It is much quieter & smoother, with the best nav interface system on the market today. I loaded up my SL because I didn't need/want AWD. The stereo system is the best. You can record directly from CDs to a 9.3G hard disk. I use the satellite radio with traffic info. Wow. It has saved me untold hours on clogged freeways. I opted out of the factory 20" wheels instead buying Michilens and 20" wheels on the aftermarket - a much better choice. It cost me much less for better equipment. A no brainer. While the jury is still out on reliability, I am optimistic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We decided to get rid of our 2002 Chev. Trailblazer for something smaller and more economical. As we currently own a 2008 Altima, we decided to try the Murano out for a test drive and we were sold.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am owning 2009 Murano for two months and I could not be happier with it. Well, I could - if it would consume a bit less but one should not expect too much (like those having back and leg problems who probably would not be satisfied in a private jet). After all it is an SUV/crossover and San Francisco is not nice to fuel economy. This is very comfortable car and to be honest I would rather be sitting in plushy seat of my Murano and cruise around than write this review. Lots of throttle response, classy interior and distinctive looks made my choice of a family car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Murano so I obviously like the vehicle and I drive for a living. I have 2 major complaints. 1.When driving between 1000 & 1500 RPM and going approximately 30-40 MPH, the vehicle makes a sound that sounds like whistling brakes but it is not the brakes. Upon review by the dealership we were able to duplicate in every model of the 2009 Murano. This was being turned into the engineers at Nissan to design a fix. This was discovered in July 2008 and yet to hear resolution. 2.Is the 20" tires and the fact there is only 1 tire for this model. Tires have been rotated and maintained and need replaced at 15000 miles. Horrible in rain/snow & I drive for a living. Not fair.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle 11/08. I have owned 3 other Nissan vehicles and I have enjoyed driving them. The 2009 Murano has been a huge disappointment. I recently took this vehicle on a 6 hour road trip and I was actually in pain when I arrived at my destination. The driver's seat is rock hard and has very little leg and back support. If you have leg and back problems, please think twice before purchasing this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car. Handles very well on the road. Drives and feels very stable, just like the Altima and Maxima. The car is actually fairly wide, and that makes it feel even more stable. Takes a bit of time getting used to it, but it is not a disadvantage. Driver has a lot more visibility on the road thanks to the high seating position inside the car. The engine is very responsive in all situations. Breaks are also responsive without being too touchy. There is plenty of space for a family of 5 inside this vehicle. This model comes well equipped and avoids including many of the useless bells and whistles other SUVs have. The standard options are just what is needed without being pretentious.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Room inside the cabin, the powerful engine, responsive drive, very safe car, the standard options included that give us all we need, the added visibility because of how high the driver can seat inside the car. Rear visibility is not a problem. Best car for the money! Would recommend without regrets!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With 1 child and a second on the way, it seemed time to step up to an suv. Did so reluctantly, but wanted something stylish, functional and price worthy. Checked out the Rav4, RX 350, Acura RDX. The fully loaded Murano LE was the only way to go. Inside the cabin is nice, with a luxury feel. Lots of bells & whistles. The engine & drive is smooth. Very good acceleration for a heavy vehicle. Haven't driven it hard, so hard to describe the handling, but it does feel like it does have some body roll on hard turns & movements. Mileage is avg at best.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice interior with good feel qualities about it. Audio system & navigation are very good. Haven't used all of the features, but like what I've used so far. I like the aggressive look of the car & the 20inch tires on the star type rims makes for a nice touch to the car's look. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2003 Murano. I absolutely love the 2009 Murano. I looked at the Toyota Highlander and the Lexus 350LX. The Murano blew the doors off of the Lexus. All the standard features on the Murano LE were optional features on the Lexus and Toyota. The fit and finish is much better on the Murano than any other SUV on the market. Nissan really got it right. The little details are what make me so happy. Like the back up camera, the keyless ignition, the heated seats, the laptop ports, the automatic liftgate, the 20" wheels, the large console display, and of course the stereo system. The styling is really fresh too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The automatic liftgate is the whole reason I purchased the Murano. The back-up camera and the heated seats are worth every penny.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had 3 Maximas, an Altima, a 300ZX, a Datsun 240Z and a Sentra, so I'm a true Nissan customer. I wanted an AWD Maxima but none offered yet and I wasn?t going to an Acura. I tried the LE and fell in love. 2,000 miles later, I?m still very happy. The driver?s door open button stopped working, but I?ll have that addressed on my first maintenance visit. I?m very happy with the vehicle and I get a lot of compliments on its looks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this after looking at Audi Q7, Infiniti FX, Lexus. This has more bang for the buck and is just plain fun to drive. This interior is awesome, great leather. For those of you who are complaining that you can't listen to the radio unless the car is running - if you push the Start button twice without putting your foot on the brake, all your accessories will work. (this from a 60 year old grandmother). I love the heated seats - kept them on low on a 560 mile drive and my back felt great when I arrived. I make excuses to drive it! Gas mileage is right wt EPS est. so far (4000+miles).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my totally reliable 2008 Honda CR-V in for my Murano. And at less than two weeks old and with 760 miles on the odometer, I was greeted Thanksgiving day with a car that was totally dead. Nothing worked. The dealer told me that I was not the first owner to have this happen. A power module had to be replaced. I lucked out. My car was in the driveway. The car ran perfect up to that point. I drive 80 miles one way to work and hope that the problem doesn't repeat itself while I am away from home. Let's see how well Nissan repairs it's cars.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a 2005 Mazda 6 Wagon and considered the Subaru Outback, Hyundai Santa Fe, and Toyota Highlander also. The ride is quiet and comfortable and the CVT operates great. Good acceleration and power delivery whenever you need it. As far as bang for the buck, none of the other cars I considered compares. The interior is of high quality materials, especially considering the price. One thing I don't like is the sound system. It is way too bright though it doesn't seem to be an opinion shared by others. The dash speakers blare so I had to go an aftermarket route to tone down the higher frequencies. Do we really need 11 speakers all heavily equalized? </TEXT>

<TEXT>Recently stepped away from my 2005 Nissan Pathfinder with great fear. My lease was up and needed to step into an SUV with good style and better gas mileage. My only logical choice was the Nissan Murano. My problem was that it is much smaller compared to the Pathfinder but boy was I surprised. I love this SUV. Great handling, impressive power, and head turning good looks. I chose the Black on Black colors by the way. My only wish is that the Murano was the size of an Acura MDX. Otherwise it is an excellent vehicle. Oh... bumping up the horsepower to match an Infiniti FX35 would not hurt either. I'm sure car lovers would appreciate the extra power. I know I would.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We hit a deer at 70MPH with our 2009 Murano. Both airbags went off. If I would not have had my foot on the dash (bad habit of mine) we would not have had any injuries. However the airbag broke my ankle in two places, leg and toe. We feel safe in our Murano - will never put feet on dash again. We love all our features, nav system, heated seats, Bose radio, etc but when it comes right down to the basics - buy this car for the safety rating. We are glad we did.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a 2003 Murano for five years and loved every minute of it. I finally decided it was time for a new vehicle. Due the price a gas these days, I decided to try a 2008 Honda Accord XLE for mpg improvements. It was a nice car, but I just could not adjust to driving a sedan and missed the Murano. I had to trade it in a go back to the Murano. The interior upgrades compared to 2003 are great. The power and handling inspire confidence and the mpg is as promised. I love the sound system, the backup camera and the push button start.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We considered many SUVs and narrowed our choice down to Toyota Highlander and RAV4, Honda CV-R, Subaru Forester, and Nissan Rogue. The Murano has by far the best styling inside and out. The size was slightly bigger than it appears so it is not quite as nimble as some of the smaller offerings. We did not want either a sunroof or third row seating and this is one vehicle where you don't have to pay for those options and you can actually find in dealer inventory. We recently took it on a 400 mile trip and found it to be extremely quiet and comfortable. It seems to be getting good mileage about what the EPA estimate suggests. All things considered I think of it as a "poor man's" Lexus RX 350.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great engine, powerful and smooth. The CVT is kind of neat and takes a little getting used to. It feels solid, the seats are very comfortable, it is a "sweet car" to drive. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I leased a 09 Murano two weeks ago. This is the nicest car I have ever driven. The leather is spectacular, the Tech package is really nice. Drives like a sports car, very happy with my purchase. The interior does not feel like a small SUV at all. The cargo space is definitely bigger than the other models. The MPG is not as good as I thought, 70 mph on a flat highway on cruise control it is exactly at 20 mpg. Since it is new, I am not sure if the mpg will go up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my 2009 Murano LE for a few weeks now. Overall I am very happy with my decision. I have driven a Honda Pilot for four years and I wanted something sportier and less boxy. I drove the RX350, Tribeca, and CX9. All good vehicles but something about the Murano grabbed me. It is the most comfortable vehicle I have ever owned, better than my wife's Lexus ES350. Handling is better than the Pilot and it is very quiet. I have tried to feel the vibration that many people talk about but cannot. I have a couple of nuisance warranty items but nothing major. Performance is great and gas mileage is about 22 mixed driving. I have never owned a Nissan but I am really enjoying this vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2009 Nissan Murano LE AWD in April 2008. This vehicle has almost every bell and whistle, including the dual moon roof. And there begins my nightmare. One day, shortly after heavy rain storm. I noticed on the inside driver's side pillar at the bottom. the fabric was discolored. Well it was wet. I called the dealer, they had a subcontractor come out to fix it. They said it was the moonroof drain. 2 weeks later another rain storm, more water. This time the dealer kept my car for 4 days. They assured me that it was water tight!! They even soaked it with a hose for 30 min. 2 weeks later it rained again, interior was soaked. 10/04/08 my Murano is back with the dealer still leaking</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have just had it for four days. The ride is good. Vehicle is stylish and has 18" wheels. Yet to determine MPG. Got it at $27K with premium pkg and other minuscule options. Wish there were more storage space in the front cabin. I like it and is worthy enough if you can bargain much. A major drawback is the blindspot. The window at the rear is a little too small and the rear seats obscure some view at the corner. You'll have to solely depend on the outside rear view mirror. Other than this and a little space, the auto is very good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Push start flaw on the 2009 LE AWD Murano ?Buyer be aware? although the 2009 LE AWD Murano is widely advertised all over in commercials, magazines and internet ads there is a major flaw with this vehicle. There are intermittent problems with the push start feature when the intelligent key is used or not used. During the first two weeks after purchasing my SUV I had problems with the push start where my car completely stalled. Neither the push start nor the key would work. The dealership has been unable to replicate the problem. I have decided to return my SUV for another model without the bells and whistles until Nissan perfects the technology behind the push start feature.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went from 10.5 mpg SUV to the Murano (my 1st crossover) and I LOVE it. I have had it for 1 month and have just over 1000 miles on it and I know I made the right choice. I got it loaded and love all the gadgets it has. I seem to be getting about 22 mpg with a mix of city/highway driving. The Bose stereo is awesome and I love the navigation and back up camera. I am still getting used to not having to take my key out of my pocket to open the car or start it. I like the power rear hatch and the power return on the rear seats. I find the interior very plush and comfortable. The engine with the CVT is very quick. Great job on this one Nissan. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This Murano is my first Nissan. I've had many SUVs in the past dozen or so years. This crossover was the answer to my needs. The Murano has been a very comfortable and enjoyable vehicle. I recently moved from Idaho to Washington and it pulled a 3,000 lb load trailer like a dream. It easily made it through the mountain climbs and averaged about 15 MPG with the heavy load. On another trip with no trailer, it averaged about 24 MPG. I'm very pleased with the performance and ride. It is surprisingly quick when punched and handles well. I especially like all the bells and whistles it comes with. The voice commands and bluetooth work very well. Overall - I'm very pleased with this Murano.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got my new Murano in April, and just rolled over 5,000 miles! First tank of gas yielded 18 mpg, and I'm currently getting 24-25 mpg (half city/half hwy). Not overly conscious of my driving habits, so a little attention could possibly yield even better mpg. Just hit my thirties and was time to move on from my sports car- after a little separation anxiety have never looked back! =D I found the quickness & agility a pleasant surprise over older muranos, and the comfort/mileage/value beat out the Mazda CX-7 & Infiniti FX-35. It's rugged enough to get to construction sites for my job, roomy enough for our two dogs, stylish for a night on the town. Love everything about this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've had our Murano for about a month. It's proven to be reliable, offers very good handling, is quite striking in appearance, and has unsurpassed quality. The keyless ignition took some getting used to! I haven't quite figured out how to optimize the CVT. I'm not too sure how far to step on the gas, and how the CVT "downshifts." Other than this, it is a great vehicle. I strongly endorse this vehicle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded two vehicles: an '03 Murano SL AWD and '05 350Z Roadster after realizing that it is no longer practical for me to have 2 vehicles requiring premium fuel. I purchased a black on black w/leather LE loaded with the dual panel roof instead of a DVD player. This car is an absolute delight to drive and I'm amazed at the amount of room as well as the creature comforts. When you press the accelerator, it responds effortlessly. 20hp more than my '03 and seems like about the same mileage with mid-grade fuel. If you select a black one, only use microfiber cloths on the exterior and say good-bye to automatic car washers. </TEXT>
