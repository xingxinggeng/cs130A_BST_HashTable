<TEXT>Having been a Mustang lover my whole life finally had the option to purchase the '09, and couldn't be more happy. The V6 isn't as quick at takeoff, but its gas mileage and insurance benefits outweigh that for the financially strapped. The car is very comfortable to ride in, and for a sports car feels very roomy in the cab. The handling is exceptional and moves, dives and dodges quickly with a velvet touch. For the price the '09 Mustang is hard to beat, its a lot of car for such a small price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>great Handling, decent MPG both city and HWY. Comfortable to ride in, even over long distances. Quiet sounding ride, very little road noise, but the acceleration can be felt and heard! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Our criteria for a car, performance, braking, handling, and comfort without breaking the bank. Plus we need to both fit (she is short and I am tall)The melted down soap designs are boring along with the performance. But our surprise and complete shock was the Mustang in California Special trim. Absolutely beautiful to look out and the build quality was equal to anything we investigated.But to our shock and surprise, the car was comfortable quiet, and performed beyond expectations. Not a sports car (watch that live rear axle) but for an everyday driver, we now race for the keys in the morning. Gas mileage hurts a little, but its hard not to step on the gas for an ear to ear grin</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the look of this car. I was always a fan of them and finally purchased my first pony this year. The outside is awesome and the v6 engine is especially peppy being a 4.0. It is not great on gas, but I do average in the mid-20s on the highway. the interior is fairly cheezy. the glovebox is pretty small (my old Dodge neon had a larger and more functional glovebox) and the center console is also kind of impractical, but all around it is more of a sportcar than anything else, so it is nothing to really get picky over. also they used a lot more cheap plastic than i would of liked. all around, i would purchase it again, and love it tho</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>shaker 500 audio system, peppy 4.0 v6 engine, 45 anniversary side badges, interior ambient color changing lighting</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My favorite thing about owning this Mustang is just the comfort of the ride. It's easy and relaxing, yet I have power too. I also love the back bench, I can now take both my best friends with me instead of having to either leave someone out or have to take two cars.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature is the handeling, that includes the feel of the rear- wheel drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I can't believe a car that is this much fun to drive can be bought for this price. Plenty of power, great exhaust note (compare it to the weak sound of a 380Z), comfortable GT500 seats, aggressive exterior styling, and with amenities like the super smooth Tremec 5 speed, the light touch hydraulic clutch, and the 500 watt Shaker stereo this car is a dream. No wonder Ford is not looking for Govt. bailout money like GM and Chrysler.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gobs of HP and Torque. Exhaust sound blows away other cars. Handling is nimble and tight. The brakes are out of this world. Multi-colored dash gauges are a nice touch. GT500 seats are great. Imagine being able to use 87 or 91 Octane and still be able to draw 315 HP/330 ft-lbs. of torque.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall a great car for the price! The styling is great and I get tons of compliments. I bought the V6 model for gas and insurance reasons and am happily surprised by the power. I have the manual transmission so I get more power and it is more fun to drive. The premium edition is a must have option. I plan on giving this to my son in two years and then I will be buying the GT version.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The auto up/down power windows, the Shaker 500 stereo rocks, the paint(fit/finish)is flawless</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a sporty car, not a sports-car, meaning it is fast but not Porsche, Corvette, or Viper fast. I like the price, the look, the engine & exhaust sound, 6xMP3 player w/ 500 watts stereo, navi, comfy seats. Interior looks and feels cheap except for the leather seats. Seat belt is strangling me. Can't say anything about reliability yet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I picked up my brandnew 2009 GT with Bullit & Nav option last week. Still breaking it in. It's a fun car that I use as my daily drive. It's quick, but that is relative of course (my weekend car is a 2005 Porsche Turbo S). Still, it is capable to pass the majority of cars on the road, and that's what was important to me. The interior looks and feels cheap (lots of plastic) except for the leather seats. Good sized trunk. Nice exhaust sound. The car "feels" a bit big for a 2+2 seater. Appealing price ("Internet" price $3k down MSPR + $3.5k Ford incentive). Good stereo (Shaker 500) with enough bass power to make the windows rattle. Pleasant overall experience at the dealership.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I own 2009 GT Premium 5 speed manual with the California Special package (it gives it the 1969/70 look) I couldn't believe the handling and stability of the drive! With the split axle option there is allot of get up and go!!! We have been able to maintain 25.8 mpg average. I am still re-learning the stick! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Side scoops, hood scoop, low rear spoiler and the classic modest stripe down the side! Just like the Good Old Days! Go Grandma Go!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had been considering the Mustang, Challenger, or Camaro for a new sports car. I needed a rear seat for my child (unless I could leave the wife home more often). After doing much research on all the vehicles and test-driving the challenger and Mustang. I decided on the Mustang. Tried the Challenger RT and it was ok but just didn?t do it for me. I liked the outside of the new Camaro but didn?t like the inside so much. Everything I researched also swayed me away from a first year production model on any vehicle as well. Granted the ?tested? numbers show the Camaro going slightly faster than the Mustang I;m not concerned. The mustang is just great all around. No regrets at all!</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I was up for a new car I tested every vehicle on the market. Absolutely nothing compared to the car I ended up buying. The price, all the options you get with it and the color options. I got the Brilliant Silver Metallic and it just shines. I highly recommend the OEM HID headlights equipped from factory. Putting on a after market kit will not compare in the least. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power, wow. Every time I turn the key I smile, that sound is beautiful. Its a sharp looking car too I'm always getting looks. The heated power seats are super comfy, the stereo system will rattle your head and the ambient lighting color options are fun. I'm sad when I reach my destination.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was going to get a new 2010 Camaro, but the dealers were charging 6-10k dealer markup, pushing the V8 version of the car out of my price range. So, I wanted an American made V8 car, with horsepower and was fun to drive. Not many of those still being made by U.S.auto manufacturers. I decided on the Mustang for its looks, excellent ride quality, horsepower, blazingly fast acceleration in the 5-speed GT version I bought, and Ford had employee pricing on the car. Only thing is the interior, my right knee hits the edge of the dash so in long drives it's a little discomforting. Other than that, the car delivers more bang for your buck than the Camaro could ever hope to accomplish.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The acceleration, need I say more! The Shaker 500 sound system, and 18 inch wheels. Fuel economy is good for a V8, highway I am getting 25/mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fun engine. Comfortable interior. Poor build quality (several of mis-fitted/mis-aligned body panels, convertible top issues, windows are aligned differently, when compared to each other, etc.). Long-term reliability unknown, but build quality leaves something to be desired. Price likely reflects use of cheap parts, which could call into question long-term durability. In summary, it's a fun, modestly- priced convertible with questionable quality control and unknown long-term reliability. It just does not give the same warm fuzzy that a Honda or Lexus does in terms of solid build quality right off the dealer lot. Buy only after you have noted these cautions.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Price. Fun V8.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Test drove the GT, but the V-6 with upfitters package caught my eye. One ride and my wife and I fell in love with the car. Very peppy acceleration, good gas mileage, and nice smooth ride. Will be getting an intake and exhaust soon but actually has more than enough pickup without it and nice 30MPG on the highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Ford Mustang and my 4th Ford car overall. My original Mustang was a 1966 sky blue AT. It had the V8 289 and Pony Interior. I now own the new, Vista Blue, Pony Premium car with AT and I love it. The retro exterior styling is great, and reminds me of the brand's peak in the 1960's. The V6 has great power at 210 HP -- equal to the V8, 289ci I once owned. The interior plastics and finish are much improved from 1990's Ford cars. I love the new Shaker 500 stereo system - - it rocks! So far, I have 2,000 miles on the car and I love it! For any Ford fan this new C5 generation is the one to own -- all the good looks of the older Mustang combined with a modern, 5 Speed AT!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>5-speed AT, Shaker stereo, all wheel disc braked, and great looking exterior!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wasn't looking for this car because of practically reasons of having a small child and winter driving but decided to take a chance and leased one. My 4-year old likes the car and there are no issues with him and using the back seat. The ride on extremely bumpy roads may be of concern for some because of the solid rear axel but even in Michigan. Classic vehicle design stands out and the interior upgrades have improved on the prior poor looking base interior. So far the experience has been real good. I'll just have to see how the vehicle performs in the winter! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>One-touch up/down window, Shaker 500 Stereo w/ MP3 audio outlet, fun to drive V8 and MT that gets 23 mph (mostly hwy driving & I don't drive the car hard). Also, I'd say the look factor as my wife drove it to her work one day and received lots of interest, not so much for her new Fusion.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Was looking for a sporty coupe, loved the styling of the Mustang, and found the interior roomy, I'm 6'2". Have owned 5 weeks and have logged 3000 miles. Performance is snappy, with good acceleration, and surprising handling considering the archaic suspension. Pony package has rear anti roll bar, big cornering improvement over base V6. ABS and traction control recommended. Averaging 28+ MPG in mixed driving, gets 33 on the hwy. Exterior is beautiful to my eye. Interior is also sharp, but Ford saves money on materials, lots of plastic. Leather buckets quite comfortable, but could use more side bolstering. No squeaks or rattles so far. Hard to beat for the money. A lot of car for 23k. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior/interior styling. AC vents. Retro gauges. My Color display. Seats. Fuel economy/performance ratio. 45th anniversary badge. Short drop glass. Availability of aftermarket performance and appearance mods. ABS/traction control. Sat radio. Side airbags. Price.</FAVORITE>
