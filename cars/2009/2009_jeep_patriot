<TEXT>Have now owned my Patriot for nine months. This vehicle is better than expected. Drives much better than my previous vehicle with was a Forester. The new interior design on the 09 really makes you feel like your driving a luxury crossover. Once you learn how to drive the CVT is becomes very smooth and a joy to drive. I did have the dreaded front dome light leak in April, i brought it in, they replaced a seal and after a record breaking amount of rainfall over the summer I have not had any other problems with it. Once the CVT gets broken in a little, gas mileage improves. I now average about 25.5 on the highway (on long trips) and 22+ city. Pretty good for a 4x4. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior design, 17" wheels, new interior, amazing stereo, very good gas mileage. I highly recommend upgrading to a limited. The leather/heated seats are great, stereo is amazing and sunroof is nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> Had it since it for about 9 months now and so far love it, got it with sunroof and speed control. Is very fun to drive and very stable. I read some of the other reviews and agree with some but some others do not agree. The gas tank is too small (I agree), Roomy is yes, there is a delay when you put in gear before it engages. It being to low to the ground, No, it is prefect. The sounds system is great. Have not really noticed the seat adjustment be to far in or out. The 17" wheels have very good traction even with a 2 wheel drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have 5500 miles on it and it averages about 25mpg all around. We bought the Limited FWD with the sun roof... and yep it leaked. We took it back to the dealer and they replaced it. Hope that fixed it. Drives great, fun to drive and looks good. We got the extended warranty (Max) thought it a good deal. All in all its been a great car.. gets down the road great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The tranny works great (CVT), color (Red) is really pretty. Good MPG, and handles good..</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been buying Toyota's for many years now. This is my first American car. I have test drove a few other SUV before buying this jeep. I tested the Volkswagen Tiguan, Suzuki Grand Vitara, Mitsubishi Outlander and the Suburu Forester. All theses SUV have great 4x4's. The Honda element and CRV have weak 4x4 system and the RAV4 is too narrow inside for my big stature. So it came down to the Outlander and the Jeep. Well it turn out that the Outlander and the Patriot have the same CVT transmission and motor (2.4l)called the "World Motor" design by Chrysler/Mitsubishi and Hyundai. I decided on the Jeep because handle bump's a little better I tough than the Outlander. More quiet inside too. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice soft ride, quiet ride. I love the interior design. I fell like I'm driving a 50k SUV. 4x4 work's great going up steep hills made up of gravel pulling a loaded trailer(1000Pds). Snow should be a pleasant experience. Love the MyGig radio. More equipment for the $ compared to the Outlander.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the first one between snowstorms - was very impressed with the combination of 4WD, traction and stability control. Traded the old Wrangler for the second Patriot because we liked the first Patriot so much we were fighting over who got to drive it. Both have sunroofs, a great sound system, and 17inch Wrangler tires with alloy wheels. The bells and whistles are well worth it. The autoshift works fine for fast acceleration, but it takes a little to get used to. Put it into 6th for flat highway driving and get better gas mileage. We especially like the lower road clearance - better stability and plenty high enough if you don't go off- road, and it's still higher than a car</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system, roomy interior, versatile cargo area, stability control and traction control (standard), quiet, CVT, styling. The upgrades really make this car sharp. We have to drive up a ravine to get out of our driveway - in 4wd these cars zip right up in deep snow. Overall we are very pleased.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My (Not) Clunker was a 1989 Jeep Cherokee Laredo that I hated to part with. A Dealer found a 4X4 Patriot Sport D with CVT1 two weeks into the program and I was able to get $8000 of the price. A no brainer. They had 55 before, but were all gone. It is not trail rated and my first 1000 miles has seen 5% on dirt roads in the hills. Does the ESP eat up gas mileage? Since it is a Sport D I had to install skid plates, hitch package, roof rack for kayaks/bikes. Planing next year for lift kit, 17" wheels and AT tires, front bumper with winch. It is a Jeep and will be treated as one. It has been a Jeep so far, but more off road tests yet to come. I expect good performance from this Patriot. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Had to install cruise control. Still testing the CVT to find its capabilities and limits. So far good on power but there is a delay. Is the delay from the CVT or the electronic throttle? Room for me, the Patriot is small but not compact, it is about the same size as the my old Cherokee. Nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Small interior, blind spots, unheated mirrors that fog up, front seats that heat but aren't power, sliders for seats stick out way too far and could cause injury. Not much pep in the engine. Oh and did I mention the 13 1/2 gallon fuel tank? Way too small. SUV sits way too low to the ground I thought I was in a sports car not an SUV. I am a tall female who half the time cannot reach the controls of the sun roof. Does it sound like I am happy? Should have walked away from the deal. Next time I will buy another make or spend more money on a real Jeep.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a tendency get into the gas a little. I'm not sure the cvt can take it. After a few quick starts, I could smell rubber burning. Fortunately, guarantee is lifetime. I've backed off the gas lately, afraid to kill this tranny in a few months. I would like to hear from other's that hit the gas a little, and have the Patriot with the cvt.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just picked up our new patriot 09 limited, sun and sound package on 8/5/09 and noticed our 1st leak (water pouring out of the front Dome Light) about 2 weeks later (1st rain storm). Come to find a Recall was issued by Chrysler on 8/7/09 for the same issue. Everything else is great about the jeep, but i've already had to take it in to have the leak issue looked at. Dealer claims to have resolved the issue by clearing a drain in the sun room. Judging by the many online posts on this issue, the same leak or a new one is likely to return. I would suggest that if you are in the market for a new patriot, to at the very least take it through the car wash a couple times on the test drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT> I wanted an economical SUV that was still comfortable for a 6'3" guy with hip and back problems. The "Clunker" program w/the Chrysler rebate made picking the Patriot a no-brainer. The published reviews made me think I was "settling" for this car; but, after three tanks full, I'm very happy with my choice. I drove all day with three passengers yesterday and the guys in the backseat were comfortable. I'm satisfied with the engine performance and the CV auto too. I attached a small fish-eye mirror to the corner of the passenger side mirror and that helps w/the blind spot. I'm not crazy about the poor angle of upward visibility for a tall driver with the seat up and back.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the ability to upload music and the touchscreen controls with UConnect tunes. Comfortable seats; EVIC features (ave mpg, tire pressure, compass, air temp, etc) are nice. Although I'm not getting the MPGs others are touting, I'm very happy with the gas mileage. 110-volt outlet</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far I really like my Patriot. I traded in a 1998 Mercury Mountaineer in the cash for clunkers program and got $8000 off with the additional $3,500 off from Jeep which was a great deal. It's taken some getting used to losing lots of the extras that my Mountaineer had that this car doesn't have such as automatic lights on/off and power seats, etc. but over all it is a great little SUV. It does get about 21 MPG, however it has a very small gas tank. I drive about 300 miles or more per week, so I am at the gas station at least every four days and that is getting old. Also, if you are used to a V8 or a V6, use caution for the first month or so when pulling out in traffic. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks great, quiet ride, smooth ride, stereo ROCKS! don't get the cheaper model with small tires and no sunroof... the next model up is soooo worth the money. Did I say the stereo rocks? I'm 40 and I never thought I'd think a stero was very important until I heard the Boston Accoustics System</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Cashed in a Ford Explorer for the Patriot and could not be happier. After 2 tanks of gas I am averaging 27 mpg and am very impressed with the performance and how quiet the engine runs. I went with the 5 speed and it has great pick up I had not heard great reviews about the performance of the cvv automatic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my jeep patriot with the C.A.R.S. incentive and the 3500 rebate from the dealer. I had it for 12000 and I cant be happier. It feels very young and fresh. It's exactly was I was looking for. I have the black exterior color with tan color interior. DRIVING IT CAN'T BE MORE FUN. If you are looking for a small SUV with a sporty design and roomy interior this is the car for you. Mine has a soonroof and power locks and windows. Even my friends that has Hondas and Nissans are very impressed with my car. The seats are very comfortable and the distance between you and the steering wheel and the instruments is perfect. I wish my English was better to tell all the joy that this car gives</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our Patriot with the help of Cash for Clunkers and an additional incentive offered by the manufacturer. We jumped on the deal the day the program started and am surprised at happy I am with it. It's quiet, comfortable, good all-season driver, and is great for taking our great dane places. Our other vehicle is a performance car and makes this one feel sluggish nor is it quite as fun to drive. But, it's not designed for speed. However, we have no problem driving in the hilly northwest, we don't have to floor it to go uphill. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Living Houston, and the horrible commutes to and from work, this little Jeep does pretty well with an average of 19.8 mpg. Even though it is a little sluggish from a stop it is a very light and responsive vehicle that really climbs up the speedometer fast! The roominess of the cabin great and sits comfortably with plenty of leg room to spare. The Life Time warranty on the power train is the best around. The in-dash compass and audible signals for gas and oil change are handy. The Sirius radio, navigation system, Blue Tooth, etc? in this device are very nice additions in ?creature features?. It has a ?Brilliant Black Crystal Pearlcoat? which really shimmers in the sunlight. Very nice Jeep!</TEXT>

It's sure-footed in foul weather, and really well-equipped for the price ($5-7K less than comparably equipped CRV or Forester, + LIFETIME powertrain warranty!) I'm happy with my Pat! If you're in the market, put it on your must drive list.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Patriot is the ideal 4x4 with good MPG. I got the Freedom Drive II and still get 22-25 MPG depending on driving habits - the car is roomy, the leather is great and the uConnect Navigation radio fantastic. I could not be happier with the car, the interior design and the looks. The car inspires me. I tested the Subaru Forester, Imreza and Legacy as well as the VW Tiguan. My Patriot is American made, handles as well, does not require premium gas and is as "luxurious". The attention to detail is apparent in the 2009 model. I love the 110 Volt outlet - for Kids and charging stuff. I upgraded to the hitch for bike accessories. Hopefully I'll never need the extra safety features or the Jeep.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been dreaming about owning a fuel efficient trail rated Jeep and along came the Patriot Freedom Dive II. I have prior tested the VW Tiguan, Subaru Forester, Outback and Impreza, Honda CRV as well as Toyota Highlander, RAV4. I own a Nissan Pathfinder LE 2001 and wanted something smaller. The Patriot fits the bill. It is fun to drive, easy to handle and well built inside and out. The materials are great. The navigation system and uConnect phone are fantastic, the satellite radio and iPod controls are amazing. I love the permanent AWD system which can be locked into 4x4 and 4x4 low. I can't wait for winter to update my review. I bought Jeep despite the crisis - Jeep will likely live.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Limited, leather, Navigation, iPod controls, uConnect phone, trail rated abilities, 115 volt outlet, roomy interior despite small footprint, ability to order leather and navigation system without being forced to buy/order a sunroof. CVT is providing adequate power hills, highways and city driving. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently switched from a Pontiac G6 to a Jeep Patriot. I love it. I am going to be on my own soon and needed something to cart my dogs around in easier. The Patriot drives great, handles well, and is extremely comfortable. It seems small when looking at it from the outside, but there is tons of room inside. My dad, who is 6ft tall, fits with plenty of room to spare. Its been hard going from a sports car to a SUV, but I am happy with my switch, I do not regret this decision at all.</TEXT>

With its 4x4, traction control, EBD, Hill decent control, & Electronic Roll Mitigation, you can be safe in any driving situation If you are looking for a small 4x4, take a test drive, compare it to CRVs, RAV4s & others; sure you will be sold on the Patriot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had My Patriot for 2 months now and have had no complaints. Handling is a little vague at times and I am still getting used to the blind spot. However it is reliable, comfortable to drive and easy to maneuver. I am averaging about 25 mpg in combination city highway driving. The 4WD does handle well in the snow and I like the stability, traction control and airbag safety features. It is a basic SUV but it serves its purpose and makes a good second car. I would buy another one </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4 WD, stability/traction control, airbags I have the Sport model with the Wheel Group and 4 WD with CVT transmission, I also like the autostick and flashlight in the back. I liked the color choices, The one I bought is Sunburst Orange with a tan interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this Jeep Patriot with the World 2.0 liter engine and I am very surprised at the performance of this small engine. This little engine packs 158 horses and Chrysler has slapped a lifetime warranty on the power train. Yes, you heard me right, a life time warranty! The body looks and feels solid and has the traditional Jeep line, although not as sexy looking as the Compass. My only complaint is not having the back hatch window open separately in order to load my lumber from the home improvement stores. Lastly this SUV came with a lot of standard such as electronic tilt control, 4 air bag, security key, and many other features. I was proud to buy American on this one. Good Luck Jeep!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always driven a sub-compact vehicle and was reluctant to look at SUVs for environmental reasons. However, after living in MI for 9 years and going through one of the worst winters ever, I decided I needed to look at an AWD-type vehicle. I have had Chrysler products my entire life and had heard good things about the Patriot. I was not disappointed when I purchased the car. It rides well, not at all like an SUV to me, and it is environmentally friendly based on the MPG it gets. As long as I live in the upper Midwest, I will be driving a Jeep.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did a lot of research before making my purchase, my previous vehicle was a subaru forester which gave me all kinds of problems. The Patriot is an upgrade from my forester. Much more comfortable, similar engine speed and highway performance. Love the sound and sunroof options. Nice getting a free year of sirus radio. This vehicle brand new cost me $4k less than the new forester I was looking at and the Patriot has more options. Love the real 4x4 as opposed to awd all the time. Also, in my day I have drivin foresters, crv's, rav-4's and Honda element, all competitors and 4 cyl engines. I can tell you the Patriot has just as much get up as the others with a much better 4x4 system. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound (9 speakers), sunroof, love the leather heated seats, very comfortable. Great for city driving, not too bad on the highway for a 4 cyl. Very good 4x4 system. Tons of safety features. Love the 17" wheels.</FAVORITE>

I drove the 09 Toyota RAV-4 and the 09 Honda CRV and I did not like them but when I drove the Patriot I felt in love with it. The interior is so comfortable and the design is so elegant; it is easy to maintain. The exterior design is so cute, perfect size, easy to park, in other words it is the best SUV for its class: (economic + reliable + comfortable). I have driven about 3600 miles and more I drive it more I love it. Thanks Chrysler for this wonderful product! Maureen, Ft. Lauderdale FL.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Patriot because I wanted an SUV for the space and 4WD, but didn't want to get anything too big. I went with the Limited - completely maxed out (nav., DVD, 30Gb mp3 storage, uconnect). It's been wonderful to have such a practical car with all the bonuses as well. I do find the CVT a little tough to get used to, and wish it came in turbo or 6cyl. as it seems like the pick-up is very slow. But, I still can't believe all that I got in this car for the price!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I just had a baby and realized that my car just wasn't big enough anymore. I didn't want a gas guzzler, so we test drove this Patriot. Chrysler's current incentives (employee price, cash back 0% APR) couldn't be beat. I really enjoyed the test drive and after about a month it has performed great. I've gotten about 24 MPG in mixed driving with the CVT. It just takes a little getting used to. It handles great and is so much easier to park than my sedan did. The new interior looks much better than the previous models did. The soft plastics feel good and don't shock me the way having cloth everyone tends to.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The A/C is awesome. The round vents are easy to position and close, and at max it feels like a frigid hurricane. The anti-static/stain resistant upholstery is a wonderful feature with the Sport "E" package, so is the 115 volt ac plug. This LOOKS like and SUV, not a cute "crossover."</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this Jeep for the 4X4 capability. In MI, I burned up the trans in my 2000 Grand Marquis because I kept getting stuck in the snow, over 9 years (only 92,000). I have to say that I will probably never own another vehicle, other than a JEEP 4X4. Vehicle paid for itself in the first month I had it. We had one of the snowiest Dec on record, and I was able to go where others got stuck. I have nothing bad to say about my JEEP. I love her. I named her SYDNEY. :-) My next JEEP will be the Limited (maxed out).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have put 5000 miles on mine already and I still love it. It is a comfortable commute and a very reliable car. The CVT is a little weird at first but you get used to it, and the fuel savings is worth it. We had an ice storm last December and mine was one of the very few cars that could climb up the icy exit ramps to the highway. I get 25 MPG average but have had up to 30 occasionally. I've transported kids from school, lumber and gardening soil with it: it's easy to clean. If you can, get it with a foldable front seat so you can transport stuff up to 8 feet long. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Patriot in a Patriot</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>The Patriot is a more than welcome addition to the family. Coming from a Mitsubishi Ralliart Lancer it was different getting used the increase in size. I like how sturdy the Patriot feels as compared to its competitors. You really get the feeling that you are on the road. It does not have a lot of pick up and go, but you will up to cruise speed before you know it. I feel really comfortable driving it as the driver's seat can go all the way back and really low. The second my wife goes to drive it she will bring the seat up raise the level so she can see over the hood. The economy so far, seems to be fair for its size. The stock radio has a ton of features, it can play DVDs that have MP3s.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love that little re-chargable flash lite in the back. Again the REQ stock radio is great. I had to read the manual to dig a little deeper on the radio to learn all of its capabilities. The 17" wheels also compliment the exterior design nicely. Good job Jeep!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife was in a high speed collision totaling our 07' Patriot. She was banged up but I was very surprised how well this little truck absorbed the impact. Since she lived and we had no complaints with the 07' we bought an 09'. The 09' interior is that of a normal car, the 07 (and 08) have an uncomfortable rock hard interior and very little storage room. For anyone who dislikes the cvt when braking, simply leave your foot barely on the gas and it won't bog down like that. It's a small price to pay for the amount of power you gain from always being in the power band with the cvt in addition to having great fuel mileage along with that power. </TEXT>

I am getting anywhere between 22-28MPG depending on whether or not it is 4 wheel drive or city driving. I bought this because I could not find a 4x4/awd for less money. I plan on keeping it for 30,000 miles. If it holds up I will buy another one with options. If I have any issues, I buy another forester. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Speakers sound great. I didn't get any features. This rig is stripped to the core. My kids never had to crank down a window before and complain about the manual locks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is by far the best small SUV for the price. I have the 2WD with a 5 speed and it's fairly quick, and consistently has been getting 33 MPG on the highway!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>GAS MILEAGE IS AWESOME! Decent cargo capacity, and the long list of safety features is nice. I'm over 6 feet and I have plenty of head and leg room</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this Jeep in Golden, co and drove it to my house in the mountains. I was very surprised how well it climbed the hills for a 4 Cyl. The interior of the limited was very nice. I upgraded at the last minute and was glade I did. I think it handles very well for a 4x4 and look forward to the next 4 months of snow, just so I can put it to the real test.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Low gas mileage, smooth highway driving, feels bigger when your behind the wheel, </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had an '06 4runner but this patriot beats it. Better gas mileage and handling ... It really is fun to drive. But I miss the 4runners roll down window on the rear hatch ... Wish Jeep would offer that feature its great for my Labrador and when I visit the local home depot.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>fun to drive</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently traded my fully loaded 06 Ford Fusion for this bare bones 09 Jeep Patriot with the 5sp manual. I am very pleased with my purchase. I am very impressed with the fuel mileage of this SUV. I have been averaging 30mpg with mixed city and highway driving. This is a fun to drive vehicle with the manual transmission and the traction control is a nice standard feature as well. I am a first time jeep buyer and will definitely be buying another one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Standard side impact airbags, traction control</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Patriot Sport 2 months ago and am very pleased with the vehicle. I get about 28 to 29 MPG on the highway and average 25 overall. I waited until the 2009s were available before purchasing since I was hoping Jeep would change the interior. I am so happy that I did - the interior dash is so much more refined than the 07-08! I did buy the manual because I like manuals, wanted the better mileage, better pickup and lower cost. I'm glad I did. I never did drive the CV automatic. The vehicle is amazing in the snow without even locking in the 4x4 (I live in Wisconsin). It is even nicer getting around town in the snow than my 1996 Grand Cherokee was. Overall this is a great Jeep.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>New dash. The way it gets around in the snow and offroad to my cabin. Overall the way it drives on the highway and in town. Mileage is pretty good too. I am also real pleased that it can tow my small sailboats and utility trailers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It appears Jeep/Chrysler put a lot of thought in to fuel economy vs performance, Offroad capability vs Onroad handling. It is very well balanced. Its not the fastest but you reap huge rewards in fuel economy. Great Onroad handling and foul weather confidence. This evening I was driving on a dirt road that turned into a mud bog. I was worried that I would have to get out and push or hike out of the wilderness for help. I have a new appreciation for the patriots capability (I didn't have to jump into the mud). For those wanting more extreme offroad capability jeep offers a trail rated package. The vehicles to compare it to are Toyota Rav4 and Honda CRV. Once you try the Patriot you will buy it</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior material quality and design A+. Comfortable seats for long road trips. Rear seat passengers gave props for comfort and ability to recline. Great Headroom. Fuel Economy. 28mpg! Safety Features Built in power inverter. Arm wrest extends & extending sun visor. Fun to Drive</FAVORITE>
