<TEXT>This new CTS made it even less painful to get rid of my old (2006) CTS. This car is pure pleasure for me. I love everything about it except the fact that it feels so smooth while I am driving it that I don't realize that I am going so fast. I loved my old one but this one stands out by far! Would suggest this car for anyone who is looking for a luxury thrill. The only thing this car doesn't do is make me coffee but it has a button for that and will direct me to the nearest Starbucks.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>pop up navigation, built in 40 gig hard drive, ipod jack, bose speakers have excellent sound, the ultraview roof, back up sensors, bluetooth, heated and air cooled seats, the clock is beautiful gives it that little extra, the car has great handling and performs like a champ! I could go on.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>One year and 17,000 miles ago I bought my '09 CTS. What a phenomenal car. Fun to drive, not a single problem, and still a head turner. Highway mileage has averaged 26 - 29 mpg on road trips - using regular gas. Truly a terrific car. The AWD was outstanding throughout last year's Chicago winter. The car is still tight as the day I bought it. The 304 hp engine is quick and powerful with a deep growl when you jump on it. My previous car was a Lexus ES 330 and before that an Acura TL. Without question this is a much more fun to drive and stylish car with the same reliability and quality of the competition. Would I buy this car again? - without hesitation. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior and exterior design. Build quality and reliability. Performance. Low cost to own. FUN to drive. Sporty while retaining a premium car's luxury and class.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Given all of the incentives to purchase a new car, I decided to replace my '02 V6 Honda Accord EX, a fine car that I found to be extremely boring. When I read the reviews of the new CTS I was impressed. When I drove the car I was even more so. Now, after 9K miles I am comfortable in saying that it is everything I expected it to be. It is truly a world-class car, and GM & Cadillac should be justifiably proud. They have produced a distinctively American entry level luxury sedan with performance, style, and quality. There is no reason to add the phrase "for an American car" when comparing it to Euro or Japanese competitors. It's vehicles like the CTS that are critical to GM's recovery.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride quality, performance, distinctive exterior styling, and first-class interior styling. Corners ferociously. BIG horse power from a naturally aspirated V6. I get to say "Damn right it's a Cadillac!" a lot.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Expect this from your dealer and cadillac. If your automatic tranny fails like ours, cadillac will have you wait two weeks for the parts and a failed attempt to rebuild your transmission at least twice before they deem it appropriate to replace the transmission. Our new CTS spent 20 days of the first 29 days of ownership in the shop. As a "valued" Cadillac owner you'll spend dollars for nickel and dime service. The new "GM" is just as bad as the old "GM" or worse. No matter how great the car looks or drives, you won't enjoy ownership if you're treated like this. I do have regrets about buying a Cadillac. Chances are, you will too. Shame on you "Cadillac"! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car looks good, but as we've discovered, looks aren't everything! All this technology with ambient lighting and head lights that follow the steering is wonderful if you don't mind the service issues. We're not happy and just can't encourage anyone to go out and buy one. Sorry!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I decided to buy a car, I wanted to stay domestic. I did look at the foreign models, but the only thing that stood out for me was BMW. I have owned GM before and have been overall impressed with their designs and comfort. What originally lured me in was the promise of excellence in design and my parents being Cadillac owners, but I was sold at first test drive. Love the car, love everything about it!! I'm afraid that between the customer service from Corporate Cadillac and the quality of the vehicle, I am now a Cadillac owner for life! Oh...FYI... I have read reviews about road noise... three words: sport-tuned- suspension... go back to that Lexus if you don't like it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Pop-up Nav... Awesome!! I-pod docking station.... Awesome- again! Interior design is second to none! Did I mention this thing hauls butt...for a V6!! Competitive Racing mode Rocks!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I must say that so far it has been a mostly pleasant experience. I have the red CTS and it does draw it share of raves from family and strangers. One draw back I noticed immediately was the width of the A pillars in conjunction with the side view mirrors makes for a sizable blind spot. Backing the car up is a bit of a guessing game since you can't see the rear deck. You can't count on the computer to give accurate gas mileage readings. On the instant readout the mileage jumps all over the place including into the 40 + mpg range. The average MPG was showing 30.2 at 65 MPH without the AC on. If it was really getting that kind of mileage I think it would have been show on the EPA estimate. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The overall impression of the cabin makes for a pleasant driving experience. The ambient lighting is a nice touch. You do have to have the dash lights set to bright to fully appreciate it. You can get used to the XM radio without the advertisements and useless banter. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With the automotive world giving such panegyrical reviews to this car, I figured it surely must be a ploy to get us to stimulate the economy and buy American. Prior to my '09 CTS, I owned a 2008 Acura TL Type-S that was my absolute favorite car. However, I drove the CTS, and it was all over. My 3.6 DI AWD is a real driver's car; it gives great feedback to the driver, corners like it's on rails, the brakes are phenomenal, and it has admirable throttle response. Not to mention great style! Overall build quality is great - no complaints in the first 7000 miles. I would recommend that anyone in the market check out the CTS among the typical mix of imports - you'll be pleasantly surprised.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall handling, interior styling, *Fast* GPS, iPod integration, braking, AWD system, adaptive front lighting, UltraView sunroof... just an amazing car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall I really love this car, and I am picky. The steering feel, ride, and all the features for the price are hard to beat. On top of that, Caddy has a signature style with this car that sets it apart in looks and handling. That said, there are still some quality issues they need to address. There were some paint issues (underspray), a shaky side mirror, and creaks. Nothing too bad but these things should not take place on any car of this class. I would tell anyone to check out CTS before buying an import. This car has it all.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Pop up Nav, power everything, ambient lighting, power, highway ride. Almost everything is great. Oh, and stereo too, wow, very nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My prior two cars were 2002 & 2006 Lexus LS-430 sedans. I established a decision criteria to keep it objective. I checked out Lexus LS/GS, Mercedes E, Jaguar XF, Infinity M, BMW 3/5, Lincoln MKS, Geneses, Audi4/6 & Acura TL. In the end, the BMW 535 and the Cadillac CTS stood out. We also own a BMW (& 4 before it). The ride/handling was about the same. Styling was aggressive versus classic. Seating was similar. Cost over three years was insignificant. The difference was the way the cars are actually equipped. BMW offers most of the same options, but they are not reasonably available. Ease of use was also big factor. Even my BMW driving wife agreed, the CTS was the best total choice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, fit & finish, GPS with OnStar with split screen including ease of use, air cooled seats (I live in AZ), fold-down rear seat, sound system, diagnostic system with real-time information, monthly reporting, dash board, superb ride and handling and acceleration. The dealer was the best also.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love everything about the car except for the gas mileage which isn't any better than the 2000 Sedan De ville I traded in for it. The storage spaces (doors, glove box, center console, trunk, etc.) are also quite small for the size of car. I got the blue diamond tricoat which is absolutely beautiful. The On-Star and cell phone service is cool and the stereo system is awesome. It handles beautifully and has plenty of smooth power!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I havent even looked at american cars in 27 years! Finally checked out the CTS with DI. Great looks and performance. I tired of my 04 Lexus with a terrible tranny problem that they wouldnt adddress. It had zero performance. I was missing my 1972 GTO! i bought the CTS 3 weeks ago and i love it! I would put the quality up against any of the foreign manufacturers. I have the thundergrey and had people come uo to me in parking lots and say"wow, what kind of car is that"? GM has hit a home run with this line. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my car now for almost a month and people are always telling nice car. It handles like a dream and very comfortable. I traded in a 2003 CTS which was a nice car but this 2009 CTS is a much better car, it looks so rich looking, more room in the front and the back. I love having the AWD, in New England you need it. All and All the CTS is a great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First it was a harmonic imbalance that was so bad it caused me to be nauseous when I drove the vehicle. This took months to correct. Then it was a rattle in the drivers? sun visor and it needed to be ordered and replaced. Then it was seriously squealing brakes that need to be replaced with about 10,000 miles on the car. Then it was a rattle so bad in the rear it sounded like to roof was falling at times. And still I have the rattle in the dash area that is so annoying I actually hate driving my car. Driving a new car at the price point of +$40k should be a WONDERFUL experience. This car is pure JUNK! No wonder your going belly up! You deserve it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the car new in October 08 and just traded it in. This car was in the shop more than it was in my driveway... from rattles and squeaks to engine lights and a replaced transmission... the car looks great - but build quality is very poor. And GM/Cadillac apologized but were unwilling to step up and make it right (I repeatedly requested a replacement vehicle and I didn't want to go through the lemon law - nor should I have had to with this "flagship" product). I wanted to buy a GM with this purchase to help the cause... but they did nothing to reward my loyalty. Very disappointing all around. The car did look good while I had it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one of the best cars I have ever owned. I could not be happier I am keeping this. My grandson wanted me to get the Cts V but im 70 i dont need that. This has plenty of get up and go. I got it fully loaded for 51,000. It has all the luxury's. MY wife loves it and wants to keep it forever. The heated cooled seats are great. {Cooled is loud on high setting} Love the dual sunroof. Pop up nav screen is a must. All of our music sounds great on this car. A few things I dont like on this car is head room in the back. Storage is nill for cell phone and wallets. There is ALOT of road noise but you get used to it. My grandson is getting a car in a year he likes mine but still is getting the XLR</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated&Cooled seats. Pop up Nav Screen. Regular Gas. Dual Sunroof. Remote start. Keyless entry/starting. rear sensors. Get up and go. Comftorable. Huge Trunk. HID lights that pivot. wood Grain & stitched leather is to die for. Brakes & Handiling are excellent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have always purchased American Cars, I live near one of the worlds biggest dealers (Reedman Toll) I always go there to check out Pre-owned cars, 1st. because the salesman leave you alone, 2nd. The key's are always in the vehicles so you get to really check out the vehicles without some salesman pressuring you. I'm so tired of seeing on the internet about how American cars use cheap plastic (I have yet to see a car that uses any other type) I have been in Audi's, Bmw's, Mercedes, etc and I will tell you that it's allot of bull. Being spread around about American Interiors and reliability. I think Cadillac hit it "outta here" as the late great Harry Kalas (Phillies announcer) would say. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything, including the sculpted looks of the exterior and the well technological extras you get such as Sat Nav, (pops up from center console), Keyless entry/exit and start, 40 GB hardrive, heated/cooled seating, remote start, great fuel economy on regular gas. I have the AWD 3.6 DI. 304 HP.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At a time when so many new cars all look alike, this vehicle is truly distinctive in design inside and out. This car handles like a dream. Build quality is great. My average mileage is 23 mpg and on the road at legal-plus speed it is 28 mpg. A little more punch would be nice. I am considering a performance chip if I can find one. I had a problem with the radio coming on all by itself! It took a few phone call and a few months, but it was corrected. On a wet rutted road water splashing under the car on the left side makes a lot of noise. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car! I owned a 2003 CTS and this one is night and day! Test drove G37S, Audi A5, and Jaguar XF. This car compares to all except G37S which was fast and fun but rough ride. The Audi and Jaguar were overpriced compared to the CTS and features offered. The only thing that bothered me on test drives was the cooled seats (back hurt). Bought car without cooled seats. Other then this I love the car - cool look and great ride! Very good price for the features and quality provided. Also 0% finance and fantastic rebates you can't pass up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I never would have thought about buying an "old mans" Cadillac, a "new" car or an automatic transmission. However, a weekend at the Performance Driving lab in NY got me hooked! I drove several Audi's from the A-4 and A-6 models, Mercedes, Dodge Charger and Challenger and the new Camero was on my list. The CTS with the Direct Injection, Performance Package, and AWD was the best car for the money and the combination of features. The Caddy has more room and a better interior than even the German cars, which surprised me since I grew up with Audi. The hopped up CTS is NOT AN OLD MANS AUTOMOBILE! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the double sized sunroof. Fold down rear seats hold 2 full bags of ice hockey equipment. Plenty of room! 3-4 golf bags, no sweat! The mileage on a recent 2500 mile road trip was better than advertised even with speed limit +10 most of the way. Very Comfortable car! Touch screen NAV/Sound</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love to drive a manual transmission! The Cadillac dealership and the CTS were on my list of dealerships to visit, of those who had 6-speed manual vehicles. It was love at first sight on the car lot, with it's excellent looks in its' white tri-coat colour! The driving experience was great, with the FE3 sports suspension, +300hp direct injection engine, and with it's 18inch wheels. The turning radius was real tight! I could not pass up on the price. With my trade in, a $42,000 car for less than $29K! The Catera Touring Sedan (CTS) is a great buy in my opinion, and with the excellent service I've gotten so far from the dealership, Cadillac is one GM division that is making its' vehicles right.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Getting 23.5-24mpg in the city with regular gas. That 6-Speed Manual Transmission! 40Gig HD for music. Doublewide sunroof. Heated/cooled seats. Lights that follow the road around corners. Turning radius. Carbon fiber instead of wood inlay around cabin. Leather! People turning their heads to look!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After loving this car from afar ever since its re-design, I had the opportunity to purchase one. I purchased the car with the Luxury package and I couldn't be happier. While the car has an easy going glide to its drive, it also has command of the road. The accelaration and handling are quick and confident. The interior is extremely lush and full of technology. The outside of this car is stunning. My car is black on black and causes heads to turn. At full price, this car is underpriced. Luckily, Cadillac frequently offers financial incentives that are genuine and too good to pass up. Anyone who is looking for a performance luxury car should not pass this car by.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a small economy car with no extras except power steering and brakes. My wife drives a 2004 RX330, so I do own something to compare the CTS to. The CTS was purchased during the red tag sale. I have never been more satisfied with a auto purchase. The price was right and the salesman and dealership are right up there with the Lexus dealerships that I have had experience with. The engine is a dream, the ride is super, the handling is excellent, including a tight turning circle. My wife and took a 1600 mile trip over a three day period (24 MPG). 700 miles each day going and coming back. We were never tired and had a ball learning to use XM, nav and OnStar. I love this car! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Did not think I needed OnStar, because I have a nav system. After the trip, I love OnStar! The CTS driver info display is great. It integrates OnStar, nav and audio to give turn-by-turn directions. OnStar sends monthly report on vehicle maintenance. Fit and finish, interior & exterior lights are great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got the AWD DI w/premium option pkg. Performance, technology and luxury that competes well with the German and Japanese lines. I was very surprised when I first test drove the CTS and was sold almost immediately, but I did the requisite amount of research and became even more impressed as my knowledge of features increased and did side-by-side comparisons with the competition. Also, the dealers are entertaining at or below "invoice" offers (in addition to the factory rebates) while the Japanese car dealer smug mugs still have the gall to talk sticker price! I really think Cadillac has made a good come back. I will update this review in about 6 mos.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car looks hot but has a few quirks. It's hard to see out of, isn't as roomy as it looks, and sometimes has trouble starting. The DI engine either just doesn't like sub zero temps or is plain tempermental, but on occasion, I've had trouble firing this baby up. Having said that, the AWD is awesome. This car handles better on slick roads than my V8 suv. It looks great and is overall pretty cool. The most annoying thing for me is the telescoping steering wheel. It is quite bulky so that my knees constantly bang into it, and I'm an average to small guy. But, she's a head turner and the Black Cherry color is awesome.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had been waiting for the right time to buy a CTS and when GM offerred the employee pricing promotion I jumped in. Didn't have to negotiate because the price was right. Although I wasn't planning to, because of the price I bought a fully-optioned DI mode. Wow. What a car. I traded in my 6 year old S-Type Jag for the CTS. Electronics have sure come a long way since the Jag was new. Now I have all the toys in a solid, powerful, beautiful, and moderately priced American vehicle that I can have serviced anywhere. If all GM vehicles were designed, built and equipped like the CTS, GM would rule the automotive world. This is a fun car to drive and a quite haven from road noise. Good job GM.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Best interior in its class by far. Just beautiful. Materials are top notch. Well laid out intrument panel and controls.

<TEXT>Cadillac did an outstanding job with this new CTS. I was in the market for a new mid-size, luxury car for my wife. She drives 120 miles round trip to and from work, and this Cadillac fit the bill, with more luxury than we were expecting from a car costing $40 grand. We got the car with the Premium Luxury Collection, and my wife just loves the heated and cooled seats, the interior is as good as those cars costing twenty thousand dollars more. This car handles as good as any BMW or Lexus. The feel of the ride is almost as good as those high end luxury cars but just a bit hard with the sport pkg and 18 inch wheels, but not enough to make me look at any other make. Very good car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought this vehicle after extensive research, including BMW 335i, 535i, Infiniti M35/45, among others. This vehicle was the best value from a features & performance per dollar standpoint. The BMW's had a slight edge on drive experience and handling, but not enough to warrant the higher price and sacrifice on all other features. The technology inside the CTS is incredible, with only a few annoying exceptions (see below). I am very happy with this car and look forward to driving it every day. It has great curb appeal and is a vehicle that makes you feel great when driving it. If you like music, then you'll esp love it. Between the ipod interface, 40G hard drive, and XM, you can't ever run out.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drive experience - horsepower, torque, AWD Amazing looks (Crystal Red Tintcoat looks great on this car). Nav system. Ipod interface, 40G hard drive. Heated seats warm up very fast. Remote start is a great feature. Adaptive headlights. Interior ambient lighting at night is very cool </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>These are concerns expressed on this blog that no longer exist in this vehicle. Flash to pass is on this vehicle and it works with the HID high beams, I believe an industry first. Bluetooth is standard. It is now impossible to step on the brake and gas pedal at the same time. There is a single address book for the Bluetooth, navigation and OnStar systems. I compaired this vehicle to a Infinity 37x, Acura TL, and Lexus GS 350. All are excellent vehicles. Only the CTS DI AWD has the interior luxury of the Lexus (done in the distinctly GM style), the performance and efficiency of the direct injection engine (it runs on regular gas) and handling characterics of a European sedan.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Microsoft's integration of navigation, Bluetooth and Onstar. Fully fold down rear seat (unavailable in the Lexus GS350 or the Acura TL). Efficiency of DI which increases performance and still runs on regular (unavailable in the Acura TL, Infinity G37x, or Lexus 350 GS). GM Red Tag pricing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had Toyota, Honda, Honda, Mini, Scion, VW and Honda. This is my first upgrade into the luxury category and I was thinking of a Lexus until I drove my new CTS. This car has it all. Looks, design, comfort, fun factor, reliability and safety. And did I mention looks!. I absolutely love it so far. It is just amazing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hard drive for music files. Heated-cooled seats, OnStar, navigation, and the best is the pop up nav screen.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The '09 CTS is an absolutely fantastic car! I compared it to BMW, Audi, and Mercedes and liked the CTS best - no contest. You give up nothing at all, and the car is significantly less expensive than its rivals. Fit/finish, ride, handling, power, comfort and features are all 1st rate. Unlike some of the imports, this car fits both taller drivers (I'm 6'5") and shorter drivers (my wife is 5'3") very comfortably. It's really quiet on the road - no wind noise, squeaks, or rattles. The DI engine is responsive, powerful, and runs on regular gas. I frequently get comments from friends and co-workers: "You bought a what?!?" Then when I show it to them they say "Oh, now I get it. Great car!"</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fantastic all-around car lacks nothing! Handling and responsiveness make it fun to drive. Interior is among the best in the business. Integration between navigation, audio, OnStar, and hands-free phone is great. The hard-drive audio system eliminates the clutter of CDs in the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Straight through the gas spike crisis, this car managed approx 21MPG pretty hard driving. The vehicle tracks incredibly on the highway and might have the best overall feel of any car we purchased including nearly every foreign brand.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Standard V-6 is outstanding. No need for the DI, save the money because the speed and power of standard is plenty offering solid MPG. Seat comfort and night interior lighting are excellent. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a wonderful car. I saved for three years to purchase this car and thankfully I waited for the redesign in 08. The exterior is aggressive and looks beautiful. The interior is superb. Second to none in terms of interior fit and finish. I love the stitching of the leather seats, and the sepele wood accents make all the difference in terms of lux factor. I wish I would have upped to the nav system/upgraded stereo however. The double wide sun roof is great for the people in the back as well. It really makes all the difference in a car purchase when you can walk up to your car and smile every time. Being super young and being priviledged enough to drive a Caddy is a dream come true for me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the wood accents. The leather stitching is unique, which is great. Double wide sun roof really opens up the car and I can't complain about the performance either. Definitely has enough get up and go to make the quick merge onto freeway traffic and enough braking power to stop quick if needed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At last, a car that meets and exceeds all my expectations. Previous car was a 2007 Mercedes CLS 550. Thirty nine days in the shop the first 14 months. Problems with faulty navigation, multiple creaks, rattles, and vibrations, AC blower motor defective, and catastrophic power failure twice. Transmission needed to be replaced.I engineered a lemon law buyback fortunately. I looked at Lexus and BMW but was enthralled by the CTS. What a car! Perfect fit and finish with more advanced electronics than MB. Everything works as described. More than adequate power with superlative handling and acceleration. The only thing I gave up was a one half second 0 to 60 time. GM and Cadillac have produced a world class car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation which is intuitive with touch screen. Shifter with sport and competition modes. Ambient lighting </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the 09 CTS to replace my 07 Infiniti. Prior to that I drove an 06 Infiniti and 03 BMW 5 series. The CTS is every bit as good and has better styling & ride. The performance and technology matches & surpasses my previous cars and the price was right. Cadillac has built a first class car that can compete with anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned many many cars, mostly German and some Japanese luxury brands, this CTS is my first US luxury sedan in 25 years! It certainly competes well with all those brands, but with all the incentives and employee pricing, value ratio was the best of them all. In fact, I traded in my 2008 BMW 335i twin-turbo coupe shortly after for another car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Folks, GM/Cadillac is offering incredible cash back pricing on the CTS. I was able to load up fully and remain under 40 Grand. Cannot believe BMW or Mercedes is not having a heart attack over this American car. Absolutely love this vehicle running on regular gasoline!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MPG is Good approx 21 combined hard driving. Regular gasoline, A/C seats, outrageous audio/nav system. Steering is on par with Germans yet service light remains Off unlike Mercedes Service Engine Soon light on literally every other month.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Made an unbelievable deal for the base model with GMS pricing (which is still available on the '09 base model), Lease Loyalty Cash, Bonus Cash (for paying cash), Rebates and GM Card rewards. Paid only 64% of MSRP. This is an attractive car inside and out. It is enjoyable to drive. A solid, but not harsh, ride. I am 5'10 165 lbs. and I think the seats are very comfortable. I could see where someone larger than me would think that the seats might be too narrow. Also rear headroom is limited to 6' adults. Rear visibility is very limited. This is my biggest knock against this car. But many cars I test drove had this same problem. Overall very happy!'</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking at BMW, Mercedes, and Audi when I settled on the CTS. The quality of the interior and layout is far superior. The car is very sporty too. I get lots of compliments on it. The car doesn't need premium gas which is a huge plus. The voice activated command is nice and works well. Besides my 2005 Corvette, this is the first domestic car I've purchased in over 20 years. I have high expectations for my CTS and have not been disappointed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Prior to my purchase of this outstanding motor vehicle, I owned a 2003 and then a 2005 Escalade. No vehicle that I have ever purchased even comes close to matching the 2009 CTS! This includes vehicles like Mercedes Benz and Audi. This CTS is absolutely pure fun to drive, gives a feeling of confidence in all driving situations and is extremely beautiful inside and out. People have come up to me and told me that they think that it is one gorgeous automobile.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Because I'm from the North, that is, it snows here in winter, AWD was a necessity for me. When I was looking for a new ride I tried them all. To be fair, I looked at all AWD cars similarly equipped. So, in searching, I found: IS250 (no guts-204HP, no glory). G35X, too much $$$ when you add the Sport pkg, wasn't impressed much except for the exhaust note. M-B C300-4Matic, too much $$, period! BMW 3or5 X anything, ditto. One minute behind the wheel of the CTS, the choice was clear. Motor Trend Car of the Year, need I say more? When you add the Cadillac Care program and warranty items like a free loaner, free maintenance, etc. End story! Anyone saying bad stuff about this car needs help, fast. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>What's not to like! Nav system, french leather dash, Heated/cooled seats, steerable headlights, Bose sound system, 300+ horses, AWD, keyless start, the list goes on. My Thunder Gray CTS is one of the most interesting colors I've ever seen. I now know why Chip Foose would spend extra on paint, WoW!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has it all. GREAT styling inside and out, fantastic handling and outstanding build quality. Fun to drive quotient is off the charts! I've driven my new CTS approx 2,200 miles in both suburban / expressway as well as an 800 mile highway driving. AWD glues the car to the road, yet provides a comfortable ride without sacrificing feel for the road. And, it's a head turner to be sure. Not a creak, squeak or rattle - this car is tight! My previous car was a Lexus ES330 and before that an Acura TL. Before buying I test drove Acura, Lexus and BMW's. The CTS is by far and away the best vehicle in it's class! Highly recommend the AWD and direct injection 304 HP options. Kudos Cadillac & GM!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance, handling, comfortable controlled ride yet with great road feel, interior / exterior design, gauge lay-out, AWD, 22 mpg suburb / expressway and 29 mpg highway on regular gas. Blue tooth, On-Star with driving directions feature. Leather interior stitched by Coach. One very solid car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Drove from Indianapolis to Vail and back. I encountered every conceivable weather condition except snow --sunshine, rain, and even hail; high buffeting winds and still air; temperatures from the 40's to the 90's. Indianapolis is 500 feet above sea level. Vail pass is 10,200 feet. I kept the cruise at 77/78, except in Colorado, where I found it easier to drive with the cruise off. The car is so smooth, quiet, and comfortable that I frequently found myself doing 90 when I was not using the cruise. The A/C was flawless in the 90 degree sun, and the cooled seats were wonderful. The drive was almost like playing a video game from my easy chair. I got 26.3 mpg going west and 27.1 returning east.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very comfortable seats, automatic temperature control (including heated & cooled seats) for driver AND passenger, suspension, automatic transmission, quiet smooth ride, keyless entry & ignition, steering wheel controls, memory seat, and did I mention very comfortable seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Took possession of a new 09 CTS 3 days ago. Chose it over an Infiniti M45X and hoped I would not regret it. So far, so good. This car is a beautiful automobile and fun to drive. I have Black Cherry color and it is loaded with the performance package.Controls are easy to understand much like the 06 Cadillac DTS that I just sold. As far as reliability, I can't comment because I have only had it 3 days. I love driving this car and do not regret going to a 6 cylinder from the 8 cylinders that I have always driven. Way to go Cadillac!
Oh yes. A back up camera would be a wonderful addition. My 2009 CTS has the huge sunroof, which is great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I think I may be one of the first people to take delivery of an 09 CTS. To start with I have driven BMW's before and like them, but they are expensive and don't look as good in my opinion. I got the fully loaded DI with the summer performance package. This car is amazing. It is amazingly agile and has lots of room. The car stands out as very bold and the interior look, fit and finish is first rate. Much better looking on the interior than a BMW or Mercedes. The electronics are great and a lot of fun and I have to say I have never been in a car more elegant at night than the CTS. The lighting is amazing. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation, remote start, cooled seats, built in hard drive, Sound system, feel of the leather, bluetooth, steering feel, solidity, and road feel. Oh yeah, the lighting both inside and out.</FAVORITE>
