<TEXT>Very impressed with the tc I love the sound system and how quick it accelerates when you downshift I love the sunroof and the reclining back seats (even though I'm never in the back LOL) on thing I was a little disappointed on was the fuel economy for a 4 cylinder the fuel economy was not what I expected but all in all it is a great car. Plan to start modding it soon and there is so many things you can buy its amazing scion did real good on the tc</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Tc on a complete whim! Actually paid for it before I even placed hands on it. I drove 3 hours to pick it up and what I found upon arrival was nothing short of what I expected. Beauty is in its simplicity and somewhere in its simplicity is a hidden power that I do love. It's sporty, with a back seat! Everything this 22 year-old single father will ever need. Kudos to Scion!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hatch, but without looking like a hatch! I can fit my guitar, some small luggage in the hatch, my kid in his carseat in the back and still turn heads on the street.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I used to valet so I've driven everything from a Honda Del Sol to a Maserati Quattroporte, and I tried to be as fair as possible when rating the Tc. Here are my pros and cons: I have already logged over 10k miles on my car without a single problem. The back moonroof shade will rattle if you drive on the hgwy w/ the windows down (to be expected) Scion cut costs on the frame, but if you can do that and still score 5 star safety ratings, who wouldn't? my tires' tread is already getting low. I'll be lucky if they last 10K more miles it's not very quick.. at least not with a manual. 1st is done early compared to other light-weight cars interior could use a quality boost</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Able to control Ipod with the steering wheel, sound system, sunroof, and I found the suspension to be quite respectable.. I don't rev to the redline, but I do drive like a maniac at times, and it handles rather well</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>9000 miles and not a single problem! I like to tinker and working on the car is very easy. Anyway, car rides great, handling could be a little better (came from a Celica) but it still maintains a fun-to-drive factor. Where else can you get such a long list of features for the money?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy to work on/do maintenance, reliable, holds value!, interior build quality, projector headlights, fold-flat seats, factory ipod integration/steering wheel controls, front seats fold back, I could go on forever</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned this car for almost a year and I must say I still love to drive it. I have owned allot of cars over the years and I usually get bored with them after a few months, but not my tC. This car has the necessary power, style and comfort to keep you coming back for more. I really like that Toyota did the first two scheduled maintenance services for free. The car is put together well and offers a spacious sleek design for a coupe. I went from driving a truck to my tC and I haven't missed my truck, aside from the occassional need to haul something big. I got the optional Nav system which was a bit pricey but worth the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system with Navigation (Big touch screen)is excellent. Plays DVD's too!! Moon/sun roof is great and I loved the reclining back seats. The optional body kit sets off its sleek design and the Pearl white paint is beautiful. Looks even better with my dark tinted windows..</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle trading in a Mazda 3. I live in WI so driving a Mazda 3 hatch without ABS was difficult to say the least. This car handles great in the winter. We had a pretty bad winter this year and I had no problems with it's handling. Much better than what I had before. More room in the back then what you'd think for passengers who sit in the rear. Car stayed on track in the snow and when ABS kicked in it stopped. Ipod hookup is awesome in this car, better than a lot of Pioneer aftermarkets out there right now. Car looks great on the outside, I get a lot of stares and comments. Roomy interior, but the build quality could be better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the sound system, well worth the money to upgrade. Love the two moon roofs even though the backseat one doesn't open. Drives nice in the city. AC works great, it gets nice and cold for hot days.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So this is my first new car I bought. very happy with it. Great for one person. Drive is smooth, and no problems thus far. Good pick up. Basic model features are great. Moonroof/sunroof is awesome,I love it. The only this is that it's a little rattly at times. I put a spoiler on the car, so I just found out I can't put a rack on the back, but that is a minor issue. If you are looking for a small, fun, sporty, nice looky car with a smooth ride, this is perfect for you.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First of off, this car is one of the best looking car out there. Driving experience, the shifter is kind of high and the armrest usually hits my elbow;shifting, "biggest complaint". The gauges could been a little bigger. The suspension is horrible! Other than that it is a pretty smooth and quiet car, plenty of torque. I would think that Toyota could have done more with the 09 model. Basically if you really want experience your tC, you would defenitely need TRD upgrades. The tc is really not up there with the civic SI or cobalt SS. Just because it is a coupe doesn't mean it is a sport car in my opinion. It's an OKAY car but I highly reccomend the Civic SI; Have you sat in an SI's seat? DO IT!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I debated for quite some time which car to look at and chose this one simply because it comes with some awesome standard features for a very reasonable price. I love driving this car, I test drove the automatic but ended up getting the manual and I am glad I did. Even though it is a compact car, there's plenty of room up front. The car looks wonderful, inside and out, even considering I don't like the other Scion models.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sunroof and moonroof are excellent. The iPod connector comes in handy, allows me to change songs using the steering wheel controls. The factory sound system is pretty impressive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has some serious pep! I went from driving a VW Jetta with 115hp and 122lb. foot of torque. I love everything about this car. The interior is awesome, very easy to read the dials and is truly a sports coupe hatchback. I had a problem with my Jetta not starting in cold weather, I live in Michigan, and it gets well below zero, my jetta wouldn't start, but my Scion will, with ease. I no longer own the Jetta. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are: -The Engine -The interior as a whole -The Sound System is phenomenal!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drove many car before the tc and it was by far the best. Mazda3, civic, protege, neon, etc this is by far the best car I have had. Car is cool, looks good, many many options of mods and wheels just many many ways to make it better and faster. I got the car a month ago and I love it. 5 speed engine intake hks exhaust 10,000k hids yellow jdm fogs 2 12 subs 2000 Watt amp lowered it on tein coilovers and upper sway bar. The moonrof is amazing I live in Florida and its the best choice for this place!

<TEXT>I bought my Scion TC after driving almost every car on the market that was under $25,000 and being a previous Mazda salesperson and Mazda3 owner. I fell in love with the vehicle inside and out. I have had 2 problems with the car not starting and Toyota cannot figure out the problem. When I took the car in for service they always give me a loaner car and always call me with updates on its status. Its been a few months since the problem and I love the car otherwise.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my car in May. I fell in love with it. But about a week ago it popped out of gear (manual). I have just found out that the synchronizers failed and they are replacing at least 3rd gear in the tranny. After getting the diagnosis I looked it up and apparently this has been a problem on and off since 2005. I am hoping that the fix will resolve the issue permanently and that this isnt an ongoing thing. The dealership is currently repairing the car and have been great but they never mentioned that to me when discussing a manual versus an automatic. Even now they didn't mention it was a known problem. I researched it. Other then this issue, I love this car through and through.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Manual transmission is fun on this car. The stereo is amazing. The moon roof is wonderful. The style is very sporty. It handles well in turns and on the highway. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>They pretty much look the same but I did notice some slight differences. For one, the seats are darker. When you put the A/C to the coldest position, it says ?A/C Max.? If you have a manual transmission, the shifting is a lot easier in the 2009 than the 2008. I think the gears also rev higher in the 2009. Other than that, they are pretty much the same.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The thing I like best about the Scion tCs are its safety features. The car kept me out of the ER when my Scion tC 2008 was wreaked. That's why I bought the same thing in the 2009 version. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car 3 days ago and I LOVE it! I was actually looking at pontiac g5's and Chevy Malibus before being dragged to look at Toyotas by my parents. I didn't really like anything I saw until I saw the Scion. I am not a fan of hatchbacks or small cars at all, but after test driving it and all the features it had just as a stock car I was impressed. It has a lot of torque for such a small car and is so much fun to drive. It doesn't even look like the ugly boxy cars I pictured as Scions.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Dollar for dollar this is the most car for the money. Where else for 17k can you get a sun roof, ipod integration, alloy wheels and Toyota reliability? Let us not forget it has a Camry engine too! The fold flat rear seats are awesome too. Digital HVAC controls are nice too, most cars this cheap have lousy dials/knobs. If the "suggested improvements" things I listed are addressed it could possibly be a car with no compromise! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my 2009 tc. After having my car for a month, the only thing I have found wrong with the car is the seats, the seats stain very easily. After washing my car I opened my moonroof which I love a few water drops landed on the seats staining them making the seat look dirty. The material also picks really easy but other than that the car is great love it</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is so much fun to drive. For what you get with this car and the looks you can't beat the price. Plus you get Toyota reliability as a perk. I've only had my car for a month, but overall I am satisfied and impressed. It has many more features than me $32K Jeep did. It's only a few more dollars a month, it's brand new, and gets me a lot better gas mileage. I am very glad I looked this way. I drove a Corolla, Civic, and a few other competitors and none really compared to this car. I suggest you drive one. My other car is an automatic, and I didn't like the tC when I drove it in an auto even though it was peppy, the manual won me over. Scion dealers are easy to work with too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Full panoramic glass roof with power moonroof, steering wheel radio controls, high polished alloy wheels, Pioneer sound system there are so many settings to make it sound great. The turn signals on the mirrors, the seats and overall interior. I feel like I'm driving a $25-30K car for much less.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Yeah so it's made for people younger than me (51) but I love my TC. The drive, comfort and handling impressed me from day one. Plenty of pickup, great visibility, a pleasure to drive. Plus the TC is a great value $$$. 160-watt stereo has too much bass for my tastes but it has great iPod interfacing. Logical interior layout. The moonroof is terrific. Good gas economy. Roomier on the inside than it looks from the outside. Large cargo space with back seats folded down. I get lots of compliments on how my silver TC looks. It's a sleek & sexy car. All the other Scions look clunky to me but the TC stands out. I don't think there's a better new car for under $20k out there.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance and handling are #1. Tight steering that feels right. Great stereo and moonroof. Good interior layout, room and overall comfort. There's actually a place for my left foot! One-piece key/remote. Tons of available options. The TC looks as good as it drives.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had my 09 tC for two months - adore it! Superb performance and handling. Response is crisp and solid. Rides low to the ground. No problems with build quality or function. Great cruise control. No acceleration delay, very quick off the line and smooth pickup. The premium 160 watt stereo is incredibly loud - too much bass at times but terrific iPod control. Love the panoramic moonroof. My only complaints are that the gauges are hard to read in daylight, esp the speedometer. Don't like the orange gauge lights - wish they could change to blue like the stereo can. I'm 6' tall and the back seat is very cramped but I never sit there anyway! Doors are a little long. Great value for the price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Premium stereo is da bomb! Great iPod control. Awesome moonroof. The left foot rest is thoughtful. Overall design is very sleek. Tons of options available. Everything a sports car should be.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Yes this car is smaller than most but if you are a smaller person this car is perfect. I would not recommend the car to anyone who is taller than 5'8" because it has a bit low roof but other than that everything else about this car is great. Wonderful get up and go with fantastic handling. It also comes stock with a great Pioneer 7 speaker system (6.1 system). The car drives very quiet and will not disappoint. There is not a ton of trunk space but if you are not using the back seats they easily lay down and your trunk space is doubled. I would honestly recommend test driving this vehicle just to see if it works for you...because if you fit in it you will LOVE THIS CAR!</TEXT>

After breaking the car, in it just feels so cheap. I want out of this thing and back into a Civic, worst mistake of my life is buying this car. I thought Toyota was quality. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My first Scion and I am not disappointed. This car has a lot of torque for a 4cyl and moves pretty fast. I would say that the fuel economy is rather low for a 4 cyl and notice that on the freeway, i ride at around 3,000 rpm constantly. Maybe a 5 gear for automatic would have been a good option for the fuel economy. Also, when you gas it for speed, it doesn't take off right away, but does build up speed very fast. Love the moon roofs, and just the over all feel. Other thing I notice is at 70 mph, on freeway, I hit a bad patch of road that made my car feel like it was bouncing. Not a big deal, but was very noticeable. Over all I love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After a rather long process I picked up my 09 TC and am very happy with pretty much everything about it. The basic stereo sounds quite decent and the tiny sub actually does a decent job of filling in the lows. Make sure to hold the SSP button for 5 seconds and change the mode from Tc (xB sounded best to me). The car feels plenty strong for normal driving and takes hills happily. Only cons I can think of so far are that the steering wheel sits a bit low (or the seat is high) and sits a bit too far forward so either it's a bit far from you or the pedals are too close. The clutch also has unusually long travel which is a bit odd. Overall I am very happy, looks and drives great!</TEXT>
