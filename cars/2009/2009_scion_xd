<TEXT>Bought this car for use as my wifes and myself commuting car and to keep the SUV in the garage to keep the miles off it and save some money in gas. We keep the rear seats down and use the area as a cargo area. The dogs love the cargo area as well. We purchased an after market rubber mat that covers the complete cargo area (with the seats down). The car looks small on the outside, but inside there is a lot more room than you'd expect. We did look at the Honda Fit, but liked the look and the wat the xD drove. Also, the local Honda dealer marked up the price of the Fit by $2500 over MSRP and unwilling to negotiate off that price. Glad we passed on the Fit. The Xd fits our needs.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great fuel economy - we have been getting 34 - 38 mpg on our commute (2/3 freeway and 1/3 city). Toyota quality. Lots of cargo space when the rear seats are folded down. Stereo sounds Great! Ipod adapter. Comfortable ride. Also, the proven reliable Corolla engine is in the xD. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Scion. I drove a Jeep Wrangler before. I still have it but the gas mileage was killing me. I drive a lot. Got in April, has 17,500 on it. It is responsive, handles very well. It has plenty of room for my family of 4. The stereo(base) it great. The gas mileage is much better than advertised. I get 34 on a bad day. Some days 39-40. Curb height is good. It is fun to drive. Routinely drive 75 on the interstate. Not at all squirrely. It goes were you put it. Corners well, stops great. The dealer is also responsive and great to deal with.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stereo, double glove compartment, Everything.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Scion. But the mileage ratings are low. I get around 34 mpg on a bad day. Some days I get as much as 39. Also I have no complaints about the interior space. I have a family of 4. This is our largest car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stereo. The gauge that tells me how much gas I use. The dealer is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only had the Xd a few days. Did a clunker trade in. Bought the Wasabi Green Release series in the manual transmission. First tank of gas averaged 37.6, mostly highway at 70-75 mph. Refueled, and then got 44 mpg at 60 mph on the highway, carrying 2 adults and 3 children. Very fun to drive, accelerates very quickly and nimble handling. Eye catching design and color. Was able to carry myself, 2 children, a dog, and a bike inside. A bit tight, but it worked. Yakima makes a roof mount bike rack for this car, and I will probably get that in the spring. So far, we are really enjoying the car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation with all the audio goodies. Great mileage. Love how quick it accelerates and how it handles. Rear seat configurations are great for hauling dogs and cargo, even a bike.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought xD using Cash for Clunkers. My 1998 Ford Windstar had 218,535 miles and was the best vehicle out of 45 I have owned. I also drove the Honda Fit and Insight. Have 1,000 miles on xD now. Overall, I am very pleased. Decided at last minute to get the 5 speed manual. It was a great decision as I prefer controlling when shifts occur. The car has enough power for most situations. The engine is very smooth and quiet. Road noise is not an issue. The transmission shifts very well. The handling is tight and the brakes are good. My gas mileage went from 18 mpg in the Windstar to 31 mpg (mostly to and from work) and I drive fairly aggressively </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like shifting the car best. Mine has a nice (upgraded) stereo. I like the bright red paint and the bulldog appearance. The spoiler makes it look a bit sportier. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this car for a year now, bought no extras except the pioneer radio. I had wanted to stick with Honda, but their options were limited. This ended up being the whole package for me ... looks nice, fun to drive, and great for growing into when we start our family. I was extremely surprised by it's pep and how roomy it was inside. Best of all, it gets WAY better MPG than sticker shows ... I get between 33 and 37 mpg Hwy depending on how I drive (and 75mph is my minimum). I've had 3 Hondas previously and wanted to another, but this car beat out anything Honda had to offer in my book!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just acquired the Scion XD a week ago. The cash for clunkers program got me to looking, and I almost bought the XB, but am so glad I went with the XD... Better fuel economy, abd a much less boxy look. For a small vehicle, you don't think it is small on the inside. I went from a Tundra to this and I am really impressed. Full height front seats are a real nice feature, though an upgrade fabric would have been even sweeter. Apparently there was a mistake at the factory, cause I actually got a High-Def radio made by Alpine in my XD and yet the catalog says it is only available on the XB's as an option. The invoice shows 400 plus for the Pioneer upgrade, but I got the fully stacked Alpine. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>That Blazing Alpine radio that somehow came with mine. Fuel economy-Averaging 34.5 MPG with 50/50 city/highway. Seems bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside. Overall a fantastic vehicle. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in our 2001 BMW 330Ci & bought the 2009 Xd earlier this week. So far absolutely loving it. Its surprisingly roomy & comfortable on the inside despite not being a large car. The gas mileage has been great. The interior seems to be well thought out for the driver with plenty of compartments & we're looking forward to having this car for years to come. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Some say "bulldog". I say "pug". Some say "entry level". I say "downsizer". Nimble "runabout", says Consumer Reports. "Most reliable in class" got my attention. Scion for the kids? If we already have experience and established identity and we forget the extras (really unnecessary with such a complete list of standard features) the xD has real value. Throw in Toyota quality. Dependable point A to B with a good dose of personality. For me it was dump a clunker, a great, old gas sucking Pathfinder SE. I'm glad I found the xD. This little "pug" is going to do me well for a graceful, long-term, downsizing glide. And with luck a smooth landing. As is said, "May you live in interesting times." </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Saw the dash as juvenile at first but I've come to see it's logic. I like the "sit-up" position. 5-speed is smooth and direct and coupled with such a surprisingly torque flexible engine makes slightly close gear ratios acceptable (OK, 5th might be a little longer). Hyper-milers rejoice! (don't lug)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>New owner but will try to post later with more info on performance, reliability, fuel economy. Long-legged passengers had ample room in the back seat, super fun to drive, much more spacious than it looks from the outside, still learning all the special features in the 2.0. Compared the Honda Fit base model (manual), the xD auto, & the xD manual; best handling & value by far with my car. A very style/brand conscious friend raved how my xD had more features than his recently purchased Lexus (but at the end of the day, he still has a "Lexus"...whatever I still have $6k to spend on other things!). Cross country road trip and baby on the way; the xD is read for the challenge!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Adjustable back seats, compact car with surprising interior space, leg room, cruise control (a must for me), Electric Wasabi color, drool from my friends' compliments, first aid kit, SD card & flash drive compatibility for the Pioneer computer system, pop-out cup holder, hidden sunglasses holder...</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just got my new XD with the "Cash for Clunkers" program. They gave me $4500 for my 16-year old minivan with 165,000 miles on it. Love it so far. So fun to drive! My dog (Lab) does miss all the room in her van, but the back seats can be easily laid flat, and she'll have plenty of room in the new car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went into the toyota dealer looking for a car that I had rented in PR when I was on vacation. It was the Yaris very good on fuel. Kept looking and saw the new release XD which I fell in love with because the color was green which is my favorite color. I spoke with a scion rep. decided to get the scion XD. Great on gas. Size is perfect for me, i'm only 4"11 so it's just the right size for me. I highly recommend this car to all. It has every thing you need.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a sporty, efficient yet practical car. I would highly recommend it. The manual tranny gives more of a driving experience. Accessories are hard to get at an affordable price. Responsive steering and handling. In my opinion has plenty of power. It gets up to speed quickly. Has way more options than the competition, I.E. ABS brakes, power door/windows, etc. By far the best value out there. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had my Scion since April but after 4000 miles I'm still enjoying every minute of it. I was looking for a good quality small car for a decent price how could you go wrong with a product of toyota. I am planning on owning this vehicle for a long time I hope the brand holds up to its reputation.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the cool look of the interior having an Aux port and ipod port definitely get use outta both. I bought am aftermarket armrest from ebay works just fine for me. Overall great car fun to drive without a doubt.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought a Scion because I loved our 2007 xD and have loved the Scion brand/product. Its a fun little car. Great pick-up when you need it. It gets great gas mileage - I do 50/50 city/freeway and get about 31mpg (and I'm a lead footed driver). I do have to say, I'm 6'3 & this isn't a great car for tall people (the xB would be a better choice). Haven't had any issues in the year of ownership. The adjustable back seats are loved by passengers & there is actually ample leg room back there (the flat back floor helps too). Holds lots of stuff when you need it. Major complaints...cup holder placement stinks & where the heck is the armrest?! Not deal breakers for me, but my be for the heavy commuters</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>iPod connector. Peppy engine. Flat-folding, adjustable back seats. Sticker price. Tachometer/Speedometer is pretty cool. Gas mileage. Reliable. Center dashboard has a pretty neat design. Plastics inside are a little cheap to the touch, but look nice. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did my research ... I compared XD against the sentra, fit, civic, mazda 3, and lancer. I wanted a car with some power, loaded, good das milage, best resale value, and fun to drive. Hands down the civic beats all the others. The fit was close in all categories, but one test drive of the fit and you'll go running back to the XD ... the fit has no power. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive 2000 miles a month, so the low price and great economy of the Scion xD really fit the bill. Hwy mpg runs 38.5 at 70mph; at 65mph, 39.6, sometimes 40 mpg for the 250 mile one- way trip. 32mpg in the city, and more if I use the interstate to get to work. Don't care much for the Premium Pioneer radio--difficult to operate-- but the sound system itself is fine-- but nowhere close to the sound system in my prior 08 Mariner. Road noise bothers me a little. The car handles great and it is roomy for its size. I've grown accustomed to no arm rest, which really irked me at first. Long distance driving causes rump rot and achy legs for me, but it is fun to drive in city. I am happy with it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great mileage and cool looks. I get tons of compliments on the vehicles' looks. I really like the fold-down rear seating to hawl things. The car zips through city traffic well, and supprisingly, 18 wheelers don't blow me off the highway at all. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having been a former owner of a Mini Cooper, I can tell you that this car is a much better car. While it may not corner quite as well as the Mini (that can be fixed with the addition of the TRD lowering springs, a dealer installed option) It is none the less equally fun to drive. It has more HP stock then a Mini Cooper (not S of course). The styling is unique, just the right amount of funkyness to get you noticed. The cabin is more spacious, and their is definitely more storage then a Mini. Plus, the standard factory installed Pioneer ipod control rocks (an expensive Mini option). The rear seats fit two adults comfortably, and I'm averaging over 35 mpg! Bottom line, best value for the money!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ipod integrated control on steering wheel. Pioneer sound system is awesome sounding in the cabin. Ridiculous level of options available for the car from supercharger to custom cabin lights!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought it... had 2 scratches in the paint when I picked it up from the dealer... they wanted to send it to a body shop for repair... I demanded another car... 2nd car comes in and it too is scratched... I don't know yet if I can get my money back (I have had it 2 days) I love driving it, body style is good... I wish I had read the other reviews about the blue on this forum before I bought it... especially since I had the option to get a refund on the 1st car...</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Body style is unique... I am averaging (between 2 cars and a loaner xd) 35 MPG and that is combined mileage (13 on highway and 14 in city) and that is on about 500 total miles...</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What an unbelievable car for the money! Went from a 2008 Honda Accord coupe, needed a 4dr for upcoming baby, and have not been disappointed. Great interior features like ipod hookup, steering wheel controls, cruise control, stereo cranks for a little car, and superb gas mileage. Originally thought styling was a little goofy, but have adjusted to it because its so much fun to drive. Best bang for your buck out there right now if downsizing. You wont regret this purchase!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the xd since 11/08 and it's just great. So many standard features that you would have to pay extra for in other cars. MPG is outstanding I drive 100 miles to and from school twice a week and it barely dents my gas tank. So many cool features, high tech, great cargo, eco friendly, Love the interior design. Def beats other hatchbacks in its class. It's zippy, roomy,great lil compartments here and there, secret lil luggage holder in cargo area, adjustable back seats that also fold down individually,passenger seat folds down. audio control from the steering, ipod jack. everything you need and want is standard. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ipod jack, Cool single sport dial for rmps and mph. the heat is soo hot and the ac is soo cold :). love how it tells u digitally your mpg and tire pressure. lots of cool digital warnings, for crying out loud it knows when your gonna slip! and it freakin tells you!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased for my 21 year old daughter after we looked at many other cars. She instantly fell in love. Excellent service from the sales personnel. This thing gets much better fuel mileage than her previous Focus and better than posted on the window sticker. 40 mpg (no kidding) on trip from Las Vegas to San Diego. Very nice interior. Lots of standard features. Power everything. This is a very attractive all around vehicle for the youth market. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought The 2009 XD Scion. It only gets better as you drive . The Fuel Economy is superb and the Pioneer sound system rocks.I looked at the Focus. I was sold on the XD. 15,800 for a fully loaded Automatic. I was looking for a manual But the dealer with the "Fixed pricing" cut a deal for a sure sale. I'm not in anyway sorry for this choice. I came out of a Sable full loaded with sound system to rock your socks off 0-60 in 5.5. For the price and performance and GAS MILEAGE,you cant go wrong. It has pep like a V-6. Test drive one before you buy. You wont be sorry .Only down fall no center arm rest. Compartments everywhere.FUN TO DRIVE.... Oh yeah I wanted a sun roof like the sable .none </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks turn heads every where. gas mileage in out standing. Only $16.00 for a fill up. Pioneer rocks but the base could be improved with speakers in the cargo area.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Test drove a leftover '08 Mazda3 and frankly found it kind of boring to drive. The Toyota dealership was right next door so I ran over and test drove the xD and found it much more fun, plus it had just as many features and better gas mileage... and less expensive! A great car is when the more you drive it, the more you like it, and this is one of those type of vehicles. Toyota has figured this out and they seem to know what the customer likes and how to deliver it. I just can't believe how solid this thing is built for the price. Not to mention it looks good, too. This is my first Toyota and I doubt it'll be my last. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>mp3 AUX input is nice, however the iPod connecter doesn't seem to give you full control to navigate. The 60/40 split rear seats and the fact that they fold down flat. Just great features for the price all around. Oh, bring on those high gas prices too!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the car 3 months ago, after researching cars (mostly) in the same category (e.g., Honda Fit, Nissan Versa, Mitsubishi Lancer, Mazda 3). The two finalists were the Scion and the Honda... the Honda dealers' attitude (that I didn't like) and the Scion's "pure price" with a nice set of standard features tipped the decision in favor of the Scion. Soon after purchase, I made a 2000 mile trip with the car--a true test for it! It aced the test and I've been very happy with it after the trip as well. Gear shifting is smooth and acceleration is awesome for this car category. Gas mileage is much better than advertised. Comfortable for me (5'8"), could improve for taller people. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Downsizing in this economy has become a hobby of mine. While I could easily afford my 07 MIN Cooper, I did not relish the thought of the maintenance costs once she was out of warranty. $110.00 oil changes? I've driven both Toyotas and Hondas for the past 25 years, and wanted to once again drive "worry free". After research and test drives of every compact car on the market, I easily chose the new Xd. Amazing quality for $16,000! </TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving both the Honda Fit and the Scion xD I found the Scion xD more to my liking. First of all I like how high the car sits- I feel more comfortable and have a better view than in the Honda Fit. The xD handles well and has less wind noise than the Fit. The safety features are impressive and the car is comfortable to drive. In my opinion at several thousand dollars less it is a better bang for your buck than the Honda Fit.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Test drove Fit, Versa, Corolla, Camry, Civic. Liked the xD the best. Honda cars didn't respond well and the Versa didn't have a flat cargo space when the seats folded down. The xD responds right away when I push the gas. The manual transmission is geared better than the Fit's. I don't find the dials as hard to read as others say. The actual gas mileage is always less than the electronic meter on the car tells me it is, but I still get around 35 highway (~75mph) and easily 32 mixed. At lower speeds (~65mph) on the highway I've gotten higher. The cup holders are in weird places, usually low and not within reach without leaning. No armrest, but I don't feel like it needs one. Overall great car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Radio and ipod hookups are pluses. Lots of space and the back seats are very comfortable (says my passengers). Front seats are also supportive - I have a bad back (herniated disk) but had no problems after a 6 hour drive. Gas mileage (saving money never goes out of style)! Price was lower than Fit</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is better than I expected. I needed a gas-saving four door with room to carry dogs and sometimes haul bikes, skis and kayaks. And something fun to drive was part of the deal. I got the 5 speed and this car is a blast to drive. It pulls well with a wide power band - don't have to strain the motor much. Quality is superb. Handling is crisp. I'm getting 36 mpg on the highway, about 30 overall. For a car at this price, it is a great buy. The care comes with a bunch of standard features. I'm very happy with it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Over all I've been very impressed with my 2009 xD. I'm a little less than two years out of college and it has been an excellent car for the money. I never thought of myself ever driving a Scion as they tend to be a little quirky looking, some could argue juvenile, but that's what gives it personality. Over all car handling, acceleration, reliability, residual value retention, over all performance, and many awards has made it a reassuring purchase. I've heard of negative comments about the paint job, road noise, etc but the optional sound deadening package, luster paint finish, etc (Vehicle Shield Protection) makes quite the improvement. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The standard features! Also, the Toyota Corolla engine, suspension, etc gives more bang for the buck. Great MPG! Also, it's extremely customizable and comfortable! The Honda Fit just doesn't compare especially in regards to comfort. I have the optional Pioneer sound package and it's well worth it! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was replacing a '98 Civic Hatchback. Desperately needed Cruise Control because of my commute. Also needed Traction Control because of the snow we get here. Test drove the xD, Nissan Versa, Toyota Yaris and Honda Fit. The cargo area in the Versa wasn't suitable for my dogs, the Yaris would only accommodate aftermarket Cruise Control, and the Fit's seat was very uncomfortable, at least for me. It took a few weeks to get the color and options I wanted. Gas mileage in the mid 30's, so far. Nice acceleration and overall ride. Interior nicely laid- out. Quirky exterior look, but just fine to me! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I ordered my car the beginning of June and had to wait 3 months for the color I wanted but well worth the wait. I had test drove the Kia Spectra, Nissan Versa and the Xd. I have a SUV also. When on Edmunds, I fell over the review for the Xd and I am so glad I did. After reading multiple reviews I test drove and ordered all in the same day. This car is peppy, much faster than what I would have thought and great on the gas mileage. I no longer get a stomach ache when pulling up to the gas station. I have had it for one month and am averaging 36-38 MPG with about 75% freeway each day. Very happy with my choice. She is so dang cute with her rear spoiler !</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like that my left arm rests comfortably on the door rest. The heat/air controls are handy so no reaching to adjust. The seat fits my body well and sits up high. Mileage is great. Was able to fit a 7ft piece of trim through the middle. Great no hassle price. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought it as a replacement for my wife's Olsmobile Alero. This really is a great little car. Lots of pep, the handling is great, gas mileage is phenomenal, features are fantastic, and it looks like a little monster in a good way. I researched these small style cars for about two months now and it came down to a toss up between the Honda Fit Sport and the xD. Thankfully the xD comes in one base model and comes fully loaded vs the Fit, which you have to spend the extra cash for the Sport to get the same features. Granted the Fit has a little more cargo space, but for price (Pure Pricing), reliability, style, features and peppier engine, xD all the way. No regrets, we love this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Scion for three weeks today. Had 6 miles on it when I got it. My kids and I drove it to North Carolina from Ohio. It has plenty of power, handled the hills and curves of W. Virginia great. The size is great really easy to reach everywhere to wash. No chips or dings in paint after the trip, does seem to catch the bugs on front but my husband said my Buick did too I just never noticed. He's probably right.The gas mileage was excellent 31 in the hills, 36 though N. Carolina. Around home it's about 33 mpg. mix of city and highway. Great fun to drive. Controls are all easy to reach. Does have a small blind spot, check twice. I am in love, the dog and husband are jealous.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Only feels like a small car when I'm parking it. Standard 16 inch tires. Keyless entry, the little wiper in back,folding seats (not that my husband is allowed to haul anything in it until 2019) oh yeah the air conditioner! Chill ya to the bone!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It is fun to drive, gets great gas mileage (43 mpg, first fill up) and hauls my wife, two labs and groceries with no problems. Salesperson was wonderful - no surprises and all the tech info I needed. I would recommend this car and dealer to anyone wishing for max value and pleasant, safe and fun driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Needed a 2nd car for all my kid pick- ups and drops. Our Suburban has a severe drinking problem and is in rehab. Looked and researched every car in this category. It was between the xD and the Fit. The xD was $2k less than the similarly equipped Fit and the fit/finish and engine performance was much, much better as well. Also, the Honda dealers came across as very snotty about the Fit, not my thing. Didn't notice any difference between the manual and auto when testing. Handles amazingly well. Feels sporty and luxurious inside. Great on the hwy as well as our rural roads. MPG - solid 31 city (hilly and curvy) and 38 highway. Will be the kids' car in 2 yrs and they love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fit and finish, simply the best in the class. Standard options and fun gadgets available to accessorize. Fun to drive and has a sporty look and a solid feel. Great value.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>xD provides better gas mileage than EPA guidance. 34 MPG first tank, 38 MPG the next tank of gas. Car handles and performs well. Bought the manual trans to gain better performance and have not been disappointed. Would recommend the xD as a first car or for those wanting a mix of good performance and mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>38 mpg real world driving!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought our Scion two weeks ago and are really love it. It has more power than we need, is comfortable, build quality is superb, and gas mileage is also really good. We've only gone through one tank of gas so the following numbers may be not be real accurate. However, the calculated mileage was 31.5 mpg while the computer average said it would be 32.9 mpg. We live in the Sierra Foothills and go up and down 1,000 to 2,000 feet and that cuts into our mileage. Our driving is probably 70% highway and 30% up and down. On the highway, I believe we are exceeding 40 mpg when "straight and level" if the computer is accurate within 2 mpg. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive, good gas mileage, great fit and finish, tons of features.</FAVORITE>
