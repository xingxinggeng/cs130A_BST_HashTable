<TEXT>After one month, I am very pleased with my purchase of the 4cyl, as the 6cyl seemed way too much for such a light vehicle. The 4cyl is smoother when accelerating, and powerful enough when needing to pass on the highway. The leather seats are nicely cushioned in the front, but the rear seats are much more firm, making long trips surely less comfortable. I notice some road noise when traveling on the Interstate, but with the radio on I barely hear it. The ride is tremendous, as the suspension absorbs bumps well. Cargo space is awesome, including the hidden compartment for added space. Even with JBL upgrade, FM radio reception is still just okay, but XM satellite reception is much better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the dual glove compartments! 4cyl acceleration is smooth and plenty powerful, suspension is great, interior comfort is excellent in front seats with plenty of leg room given that I am 6'1". Plenty of cargo space, and getting 24-27 MPG. Fun vehicle to drive, with no regrets yet in buying it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this Rav4 for almost 2 weeks. It's a Base V6 4wd. The first tank of gas gave me an avg mileage 24 mpg for a combination of Highway and City. Ride quality feels solid but engine noise is very evident for the first few gears and once we pick up speed >40 miles you can hardly hear a hum. I chose the Rav4 over CRV, just because it offers a v6 option and Honda doesn't. I am hoping 270 Hp coupled with 4wd should suffice to drive on hilly and snowy winters.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The most attractive feature I noticed is the hill descent control. For some reason I didn't understand how to get the hill ascent control working.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We decided on a vehicle that allows the wife to enter/exit a higher driving position car. She finds getting in and out of the smaller Rav4 easier on her hip (bursitis). We took the Rav4 for its first long vacation trip, putting a total of 1590 miles on the vehicle. We averaged over 28mpg. The Rav4 handled in a predictable and well mannered fashion, but when rolling over rough pavement, you know you are not riding in a sedan. Some road noise was also evident at slow speeds, possibly due to the larger 17" (steel) wheels that came with the Value Pkg. The wife found the Rav4 a bit better to her driving sense than the CRV we test drove. The only complaint so far is the audio system (muffled).</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has great gas mileage, handling, performance, style. Forget the frills the Chevy equinox has and buy with confidence. When I purchased the car the dealer said see you first oil change. To my surprise that was the only time I needed the service dept. I own 3-5 vehicles for years and this is the first where I did not become friends with service adviser fixing warranty problems. My son and daughter got rid of their Chevy and Pontiac and they are glad they did also. My gas mileage is 24 to work and 28 on trips.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Averaging 28 mpg. RAV4 reminds me of a Corolla I had for a loaner for a month. Similar driving dynamics & lots of road noise & booming exhaust. In the morning the tranny has an annoying 2-stage takeoff from park, it engages 3/4's then full lock even when rolling. Once warmed up the hiccup goes away. Although the interior dashboard is not as cleverly designed as a CRV (not enough cubby compartments) the center armrest/console is a welcome feature. The rear side doors have only a molded cup holder for a small H2O bottle. The back door is a disappointment too. Just a fishnet and no cubby holes molded in the door like the CRV. Audio loudness feature is good because of the road noise. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We needed a vehicle with a large enough rear seat for a child seat and an infant seat and easy to get the kids in and out of. This RAV-4 is the perfect choice. This vehicle seems small on the outside, but it has unbelievable space inside. The cargo area (without 3rd row seats) is huge and the 2 storage bins under the floor are a bonus. Rear seats truly fold flat unlike many others. This one is a V6 Limited with all options except navigation. This thing is very fast and the fuel economy is pretty amazing. We get 24-25mpg on local driving and we've seen 32 mpg on the road. A very versatile vehicle for an active family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought Sport version because I wanted a black interior - Limited not available in cloth. Dealer Salesperson indicated slightly tighter and slightly harsher ride. Also indicated that suspension was somewhat programmable if really needed. Term "harsher" was understated. Can't keep coffee from spilling on local access roads and can't "program" suspension according to dealer's service dept. Took on trip to NYC - ride on highway OK - not fatiguing. Ride in NYC would have been smoother in a horse & buggy. Noise, Handling, and overall Fuel MPG are really better than I expected. Only clear fault is the Spare Tire Carrier. Quality of fit is unsatisfactory and this quirk will haunt you forever.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just returned from a trip from New York to Rhode Island with my brand new RAV4 4-cylinder - was not sure whether to buy the 4 or 6 cylinder and did much research, as well as test drives on both. Got caught up in all the Cash for Clunker garbage and purchased the 4. I am normally a bit heavy on the pedal, and this baby did not let me down. No problem whatsoever. She was a rocket - plenty of nerve. I had test driven the V6 - good, but no need for such a large hsp engine in such a light vehicle. Save your $$$$$. Vehicle was tops in every meaning of the word and I am very picky - an excellent driving experience. Cheers to Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We own a generation 1 rav4 and have nearly 250,000 miles on it. We have a baby on the way and needed more room for a car seat. We test drove a few other makes and models and ultimately decided to buy a new rav4. I really enjoy the peppy 4cyl engine and the decent gas mileage. I am 6'1" tall and find the front leg room to be a bit lacking. Also, the new rav4 doesn't brake as well as our old rav4. However, the new rav4 turns easier and maneuvers better. I miss being able to park in the tiniest spaces, but hey now we have room for a stroller, groceries, and a car seat. I would recommend a 2009 rav4 to anyone looking for a small SUV that is lots of fun to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have enjoyed owning and driving the RAV 4. Interior road noise is difficult to get used to and radio sound system is not as good as I had hoped it would be. Also the first time I went through a car wash (touchless) the tire cover came completely off and was damaged (scratched). This cover had never been removed for any reason during my ownership--According to dealer this has happened to ONE other RAV 4. Also tire cover not covered under warranty according to dealer!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After looking at Ford Edge and other products the quality could not compare to Toyota. The performance, handling with 23mpg for a V-6 is outstanding. I have towed 1500 lbs. of rock with a trailer and it was like nothing was there. I owned a 95 Nissan Pathfinder 17mpg before this and what a great replacement. I do not need the ground clearance like I had before because this is mainly for traveling cross-country. I have packed 350 lbs of dirt in the back with no problems. I purchased this RAV4 to keep for the next 10 years and I believe it will service me well. I received more incentives than any of the other dealerships had to offer before cash for clunkers came out. Plus a military discount.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Vehicle did not make transaxle noise when purchased! After 1500 miles it started a howling noise at light throttle, 35-55 mph it is getting worse, Toyota Tech is supposed to be checking on the reason for it, it has been 21 days and I have heard nothing, I am very dissatisfied with this car! I was told there was a production change, I think I got one of the bad ones. The service dept. replaced an axle at about 5 thousand miles and the axle bearing, but this did not correct the noise I am hearing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very nice car improvement over my 2003 Subaru Forester. Others have noted the stiffness of the seats but my wife & I like that and have noticed that seats are starting to feel 'softer' with more use. The interior is designed well but the materials are budget. I'm getting between 25 & 26 MPG in overall use; some stop & go plus some highway. Very happy with my RAV4. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power of the V6 still with acceptable gas mileage. The build feels strong & safe. The RAV4 is very quiet on the road. I guess most cars have it now but the AUX input for MP3 players is good and easily accessible. 17" alloy wheels are excellent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drove an '06 Sr5 4Runner prior to the Rav4....and how I miss it. The Rav4 is cute...not really meant to be an off-road vehicle. The v6 is quick but the engine does whine slightly. I expect my MPG will increase as I only have 800 miles on the SUV (21 combined currently). Styling does need an upgrading and is expected in 2012. Some interior features need more strategic placement. </TEXT>

<TEXT>One of the more practical vehicles on the road the 2009 Rav4 offers efficient packaging, two competent engines and enough safety and convenience to satisfy just about everyone. If you had to choose only one vehicle to transport a family, haul furniture and find its way through inclement weather this compact to mid-size SUV is tough to beat. There is some comfort loss in exchange for space, especially in the rear seat. The cushions are rather flat and don't provide much support so make sure those that will inhabit the space take a test ride. Road and wind noise isn't in the luxury class but it is livable especially when you consider the relatively light weight of the vehicle vs. the size.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I personally like the style of the vehicle, the 4 cyl. engine provides adequate thrust, the hidden space where the spare tire normally resides is a bonus and I would recommend the rear backup camera integrated into the rearview mirror. Locking 4 wheel drive will be handy in Ohio winters.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you didn't know this was a four cylinder vehicle, you wouldn't know by its performance. It has far more useful extras, even in the base model I have, than any of the competitors. It also has more storage, hidden, accessible and functional storage - all three. The tailgate is easy to open and the drive is smooth for an SUV except at extremely low speeds (under 20 mph) and even then not bad. I love this car and am glad I chose it. Fuel economy seems to be greater so far than specified on the government websites. Seats are extremely easy to fold up and they fold up flat and low - better than any other model I looked at, and I looked at a lot of them. This is important as I have dogs.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Super white color. Very Comfortable seats. Radio and gauges sit high and they are easy to glance at. Split glove compartment and place for sunglasses.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Once I decide to trade in my car I wanted something with more cargo than my Nissan Altima. My first choice was the new Mazda 3 5 doors. While doing my research I came across the Toyota Rav4. It rates the same MPG but has more cargo space, about the same price and looks way better. Reading reviews and comparing all the competitors I chose the 2009 Toyota RAV4. It has the power (4 cyl), it has the looks (no cheap black plastic going around the bumper) and the Toyota Reputation. It rides nice, quiet and firm. Driving in the city so far I got 26.2 mpg and still going up. I can't wait to see how much I get at our road trip to the north.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After months of research & test drives, the RAV4 won out for several reasons. It really is fun to drive, well laid out, has super comfy seats and my tall husband can fit without knocking his head off. The only negative is the front seat headrests. They are extremely uncomfortable for someone with neck problems. However, I popped mine out, turned it around and the problem was solved. Hopefully there will be an aftermarket option.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's exhilarating driving this car as the acceleration is great for a 4 cylinder engine. It gets great gas mileage on the highway-about 35 mpg averaging about 25-26mpg with mixed driving. The car is a little noisy on the highway but with music on its not noticeable. The interior could be better but for a base model its pretty good when compared to the forester or the CRV. Also not to mention the brawlik exterior look if gotten in black. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle under the Clunkers Program while "donating" my Ford F-150 to the government for destruction. The mpg is great with new four cylinder engine. EPA figures are either on the money or slightly low. Plenty of pep too. Very quiet even at highway speeds. Great looking interior. The V6 would have been nice, but absolutely not necessary unless you're carrying six or towing a boat. Same goes for AWD here in Florida, but in snow country I would have added AWD. This could be a more ideal car for seniors as it is easy to drive and easy to get in and out of. The swing out trunk lid is easier for seniors than the hatch. Same for getting things out of the back. No stooping.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had previously owned two Corolla's and loved both of them. I needed a bigger vehicle because of two new children. I test drove a Santa Fe, a Highlander and a Rav4. It took me about 5 minutes of driving a Rav4 to fall in love. I obviously like the added size and power. However, what I find amazing with the Rav4 is I still feel like I'm driving my old Corolla. I'm also looking forward to the 4WD and added weight this winter.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the fast acceleration this vehicle has. Merging into traffic on the highway is never an issue. I also like the IPod jack. The seats are reasonably comfortable. Perhaps the best feature is the room for the backseat passengers. The cargo room in the rear is also impressive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I absolutely love this car! I'm a research junkie and thoroughly reviewed and test drove the Honda CRV, Kia Sportage, Mitsubishi Outlander, Ford Escape, Subaru Forrester, and Hyundai Tucson and Santa Fe. The RAV4 blew them all away. My last car was a BMW 5-series with all the bells and whistles so I was a little worried about making the adjustment to a non- luxury SUV. However, this car has continued to impress me with its easy handling, roomy interior, reliability, features, appearance, comfortable seats, and gas mileage. I have read a few of the negative reviews and I really think that we must be driving completely different makes/models. My RAV4 has been fantastic! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The steering wheel audio controls and steering wheel blue tooth controls provide great convenience and safety.

<TEXT>Maybe because I had a Nissan XTerra prior to my RAV4, I feel like the RAV4's driving experience is very much like a car, not an SUV (which is fantastic), and there's no 'truck-like' feeling. The cornering is fairly tight for an SUV and the acceleration is phenomenal with the V6... I have no problem zipping into small spaces. I love the fuel economy, too (averaging 22.5 mpg in Central NJ). The keyless entry/ignition is so so so convenient and awesome, too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving a V8 powered 4Runner for longer than I should have, I needed to find a better MPG for my commute. The Rav4 was a pleasant surprise. I never thought I would fall in love with a small SUV. The ride is smooth yet powerful with the V6 engine. I'm averaging 23mpg which is a big step up over the 15 I was getting before. Handling is superb, although the electronic assisted steering takes some getting used to. At 6'1 space is an issue for me and I have plenty in the Rav4. I have a ton of shoulder, leg and head room and the storage bins under the cargo area are a nice feature. My road bike fits with ease with the seats folded down. I highly recommend the Rav4. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased a red Canadian built RAV 4 with the V6. This vehicle provides phenomenal power, styling, comfort and economy. On the highway the RAV is ultra smooth, especially between 65 and 70mph (110 to120k/hr). The interior is extremely spacious with plenty of headroom and lots of storage. I recommend the 270 horsepower V6. Amazing acceleration, however great fuel economy. I chose the flashy red exterior for a sporty look. This is the best crossover SUV in its class. I highly recommend this vehicle. Thank you.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought this vehicle a week ago and so far I like it. Low road noise compared to my old Civic and the seats are MUCH more comfortable - I can't feel the springs beneath the fabric like I could with the Civic even when it was new. Steering not as tight as I'd like. I like that it has the height of a truck with the feel of a car. My elderly father can get in with minimal "step-up" and can get out very easily. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good seal from outside (low wind noise). Power locks and windows. Auxiliary jack for the iPod is the best accessory feature ever. Comfortable seats.

<TEXT>I have owned my RAV4 for only three weeks but I feel it is a vehicle that I will keep for many years. I love nearly every aspect of the vehicle from the power of the six cylinder engine to the ease of handling. There's plenty of storage area and ease of accessing materials. The quality of the materials appears to be excellent - I have perforated leather and heated seats. The smart key entry is wonderful since I just leave my keys in my pocket for entry and starting the vehicle. I do not find the swing door on the back to be a problem at all as it opens widely for easy access. The rear step bumper is also handy. To conclude, I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend the RAV4.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our family decided on the 2009 Limited RAV4 after the first test drive. We were impressed with a quiet, smooth, and comfortable ride. We also enjoyed the extra space the vehicle provided. We doubted the gas mileage ratings, but after 2 months we believe! We live in a rural area of PA and are getting 28 mpg. On our first 12 hour trip, we got close to 30 mpg. We find the leather seats very comfortable and enjoy the bluetooth phone capabilities....no more worries about getting the phone up to the ear! Keyless entry is nice but can be confusing. I researched just about every available source and they all pointed to this vehicle. Limited with leather is more comfortable than the Base.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I am most impressed with the smooth, comfortable ride. Interior space in every direction: head, shoulders, legs, both front and rear. Lots of cargo space.

<TEXT>We live in the Blue Ridge Mountains, and the combination of very steep roads and snow/ice is challenging. We had to have 4WD and seating for six, but we wanted good mileage too. After two years of reviewing cars, we got a RAV4. The V6 eats up mountains without straining the transmission. There's a bit of a 'turbo' lag as the transmission gears down, but then the RAV4 jumps past cars when passing. Same engine as the Highlander in a much lighter SUV. Wow. Backdoor and wheel are same as on our Jeep; not a big issue for us. Where else could the full-size spare go? Having a full-size spare is important. Only complaints - mileage is not as good as we want and steering not as tight.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Leased this car for my kid. The transmission shifts and sounds like a cement mixer. The interior is wall-to- wall plastic with no soft areas. The push button glove box is kind of quirky and small. The center console that houses the radio looks and feels like something from a K-Mart appliance center. The fuel filler door is riveted on and has the feeling it is going to be pulled off if too much pressure is exerted. Car is relatively slow. I should have leased the Jeep Patriot or Ford Escape. RAV4 is acceptable, but certainly not anything that is above the others including the domestics. This is the last Toyota I will purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It is fun to drive this car/sSUV. The gas mileage is good. The layout of the temperature controls are good, but the control for the audio is a bit high or out of reach. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the V6 engine and low road noise. The vehicle responds quickly in cornering/turning. The back seats fold down with a pull of levers giving more storage space. The speakers positions are well placed. I like the display button on the wheel telling me about the average mpg and temperature. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Only had this thing a few weeks now, and it is awesome. Traded in an 07 Highlander which I also loved, except for its interior finish. After 2 tanks of gas I am averaging about 26 mpg with mixed highway and city driving in the RAV. Gas mileage going down the interstate is best when I cruise at 65-70 mph. To me and my wife there was not a huge difference between the 4 and 6 cylinder models performance and as such we did not want to fork over the extra cash. The interior on the Sport is far nicer than the base model for not much more money. The only thing I wouldn't mind having is the 4x4 as our Highlander was AWD and that worked great in bad weather. Overall very happy with the RAV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My husband researched all SUVs in this size range & the Rav4 seemed to come out tops in most areas. With 2 small kids we were truly looking for a used Pilot or Highlander (for 3rd row). But with my 05 Forester lease coming due we ran out of time finding what we wanted in our price range. So I decided on a 3 yr lease of a Rav4 Limited and I AM SO HAPPY! I've only had it for 3 days but at least at this point I could totally see myself buying it at the end of the lease. It's comfortable, roomy, handles wonderfully, and is lovely to look at. Went with Pyrite Mica color with gray leather & love it. I was concerned about comfort but with the pwr & lumber it's great. Average 24 mpg so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My BMW 330i was fun, solid and hugely expensive to maintain. I researched many options and while looking at an FJ Cruiser, the salesperson suggested a RAV4. I was surprised at the V6 performance and handling was also unexpected. I loaded it up and chose the Limited because of the heated leather seats.The outside spare was not an issue because I was looking at an FJ. The center dash stack is space ship like and the gauges don't all read top of dial for normal. I'm 6ft 3in. and I can wear a cap with the sunroof. This is a very comfortable car with deceptive interior room and storage space, and it is kinda fun to drive. Got the extended warranty and waved good bye to $1000 repairs.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After looking at all the small SUVs, it became apparent that there's really no serious contender for the Toyota. I was actually leaning towards the Honda CR-V when I first started looking, but the Toyota won me over with its better gas mileage and roomier interior. A lot of thought went into laying out the interior, and build quality was very good. I wasn't too sure how a 4 cylinder engine mated to an automatic transmission would perform, but it has more than enough power for daily driving, although I still would have liked to have a manual transmission. Unfortunately, being best in class comes at a higher price tag. Total out the door cost for a sport package was $23.5K as of June 2009.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is car is horrible. I get it free through work-otherwise, I would never voluntarily purchase one. It's uncomfortable, poorly designed and has a rough ride. The interior looks cheap and has asinine places for cup holders. The fact that this car has a keyless ignition is, in my opinion, a nightmare. I find myself losing the keys like crazy because there's no specific spot for them. The rav also has a very jerky ride to it-not so great when riding with passengers who suffer from car sickness. The back door opens outward as opposed to upward-another stupid feature for obvious reasons. I could go on and on but to sum it up: it's awful!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I researched for over 2 months for the right vehicle for us. With a large breed dog that travels will us frequently, we needed the cargo space, and the low loading dock. We got everything we asked for in the cargo space, and the handles to put the rear seats down was one of the features we love the most. The V6 has tons of power. We test drove the 4Cyl also, which has plenty of power as well, but was just a bit too noisy. I wouldn't say the seats are "uncomfortable", but without a power seat I'm still trying to find the right position. There seems to be SO much space all around. And the rear seats that fold flat make it all that much better. Love my Rav.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car. I have only had it 3 weeks but I am impressed (good). My other vehicle is F-150 V-8, but this little 4 banger (4 cyl) really has the power, I can't imagine a V-6 in this thing. It only has about 870 miles so far but it really goes fast, I have to watch my speed to keep it under 70 mph. We took the car over to the coast to break in the engine. Up hill and down around sharp curves it was great, power was right there better than my F-150 V-8. Gas mileage is outstanding... on our road trip to the coast and back, freeways at 70-80... my average is 28.1 mpg. I could not believe it. The only bad thing is the brakes. You really have to push the brake pedal hard when coming to a stop sign. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been driving my new Rav for about a month now, and I'll admit I've been surprised (in both good and bad ways) Good (With 4cyl): Incredible gas mileage. I average ~30mpg interstate (with cruise control going 65mph) If I go up to 72mph, I drop to around 24/25mpg so the trick is to keep it slow. Additionally I can get a solid 34mpg doing 55mph on more rural travels. I also use the aux jack constantly with my MP3 player, don't know how I went 9 years without one. We had aftermarket heated seats installed in the cloth seats, nice in Pennsylvania! Bad: The cloth seats are NOT comfortable, sure, they could be worse (i.e. Subaru) but it may be worthwhile to go for leather.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My initial choice was Honda CRV but after test driving it I found it was a bit noisy and sluggish pickup. I rented 2008 Rav4 and driven it on Highway from Atlanta, GA to Memphis, TN and found it stable between 75 to 95 MPH, but just under powered and little louder. Finally decided to buy 2009 Rav4 2WD I4, as it has a refined engine (Dual VVTi) with more fuel economy and power. I wanted to buy a vehicle which fits in my budget and able to drive to work and also long trips with space for Cargo. I did not go for a V6 (269 hp) as I4(179 hp) is sufficient and I don?t want to get more speeding tickets with V6. My previous car was Camry V6. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The new Rav4 is smoother,quicker and gave me 23 MPG in city. My one year old daughter likes the vehicle very much, as she can clearly see the road.

Handling is superb. Gas mileage has been averaging 22.5 mpg, which is a little bit disappointing. Would highly recommend the mud guards which are about $58.00 at dealers cost.

<TEXT>The sport package with the V-6 was the clincher. The i-4 is more than adequate but the 6 is in a different league; quiet, smooth and very quick. The Rav looks better in "sports wear" as opposed to the Limited's "formal attire". No spare tire on the back of the Sport V-6, is a big plus (run flat tires maybe not so much; we'll see). I've never been crazy about the dash and they're a little stingy w/options. Fit and finish are great and Toyota reliability is tough to beat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>There is no worse feeling than taking the plunge and realizing you made a mistake. It took me 3 days to realize I married the wrong man but only ONE to regret buying this car. The Rav4 is cute with that snappy little 4 cylinder engine with good gas mileage. However, the poor design of the interior rains on my parade. The front seats are flat and tilted down-- leaving me to slip off at every turn. The head rests eat into my head. The sound system is so poor it muffles human voices on am radio. Entertainment and temperature controls are too poorly lit to see in sunglasses. There is no way to hold the tiny steering wheel comfortably and no arm rests. Cheap fabric tops off the look. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am the not so proud owner of a 2009 Rav4. At 131km it had its first visit to the shop with the A/T Oil indicator light illuminated. It took three more trips to the shop to fix the problem. Now at 3000km it is back in the shop with AWD, slip control, and engine indicator lights on. It has also failed to start and down shifts with the grace of a new driver in a standard transmission car.

<TEXT>This new SUV is indeed fun to drive. I couldn't wait each day to drive it. 4 cycler engine still has enough power making acceleration sharp. So, everything is good except for one thing: too noisy when accelerating. I found the noise is not coming from engine but from poor insulation or design of exhaust system. I recommend the manufacture should recall to replace this noisy system with quite one. I feel strongly that once this noise issue is solved, the RAV4 4X4 base model can be the best selling SUV in the world and people will love it even more. Sincerely hope the manufacturer will listen to our voices. </TEXT>

My previous experience was a much heavier LR Discovery V8, and RAV4 performer better, thanks to light body and very well designed transmission. The interior everything are very well resolved, but the material looks cheaper, even leather trim is not first class. There are excessive noise in cabin, combined from engine and road. Update, combined millage is 21mpg, not bad for a I-4 AWD, but I don't think I'll get promised 27mpg freeway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We checked them all out; CRV's, Rogues, Outlanders and Tiguan, etc. All had their points. We chose the Rav because of the build quality, the great lease deal, and the hot 265 hp V- 6 that gets mpg almost as good as the 4. It's really quick, with great handling; lots of fun to drive. The Rav sport w/ the V-6 is the only Rav without a tailgate mounted spare. You get "run flat" tires instead. We'll see how that works out. The Rav is a total package choice; I don't think it wins, hands down, in any one category but is a solid choice across the board, including great resale (if you purchase). We were looking to get a little pizzaz in an otherwise functional vehicle; the RAV4 Sport 6 delivers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Why 'My Little Rocket'? My Rav4 accelerates, handles, & performs very smoothly. After over 20 years of driving the entire range of only Ford SUVs, I made the decision to go Toyota, which I believe was a wise one. I just wish I did it years ago. Going from an '05 Escape 6 cyl AWD to the '09 Rav4 4 cyl AWD, I expected sluggishness, but instead found it peppier with all-around better handling & performance in & on the VT snow & variable roads conditions. Having to drive over 2.5 hours, several times per week to VT, I find the drivers side lumbar support & heated seats a godsend. Gas mileage falls within the stated 21 to 27 mpg, with 24 mpg as my average. It should improve over time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought our RAV 4 in Nov 08, absolutely loved it. Put on some top-end 18" studded tires, and the handling and traction was great. We moved from a 95 Ford Windstar to this, so anything would have been better, but it really does handle and drive very well. 31 days later we were in accident. I was in the passenger side and took the brunt of the impact. It took a minute or so to figure out what happened. Air bags deployed, doors crumpled, but we were all completely fine. Safety and crash ratings are very high from me, as the impact felt like nothing more than a little nudge (impact speed about 25mph).

<TEXT>This car has been getting 28 MPG with mixed city and highway driving. The power is fine even with the 4 cyl engine. My last vehicle was a 2005 4Runner and the interior head room even with the moon roof is much better than the 4Runner. The Bluetooth hands free stereo is a must. The backup camera is a waste (too small). A back up beeping sensor is much more useful. The only quality issue I have found is a clunking sound shifting from reverse when the engine is cold. This appears to be a common problem with the Rav4. The interior room with the seats flat also rivals the 4Runner. The only thing the 4Runner does better is off road. By the way a 6 cyl 4Runner with 4 wheel drive averaged 20 MPG. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my only option for an all wheel drive fleet car. This is the base model, so I know upgrades would help. It is the most uncomfortable car I have ever owned. I am a healthy person with no back issues, but this seat, with no lumbar support, caused a lot of lumbar discomfort. The suspension is terrible. I can rotate the steering wheel three inches in either direction, and no response from the SUV. It is cute in appearance, but I am very disappointed that I have to spend the next three years in this automobile.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior look. Lots of storage. Color choice. Ease of back entry.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fun to drive, the V6 really has some kick, yet on the interstate the 5 speed automatic transmission gave great performance and great economy. Handling is solid and predictable with a nice balance between capable SUV and commuting car (mostly commuter car). There is huge internal room, but it is still quite quiet on smooth pavement. On rough pavement it becomes noisy pretty quickly. The interior controls are all easy to use, but the steering wheel controls are not lighted at night so I will have to learn to blindly operate the Bluetooth controls. The radio controls on the wheel were easy to adapt to though. The exterior is not much changed from older Rav4. Just a few cosmetic changes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Built-in Bluetooth and XM radio. Reclining rear seats. Instrument cluster showing instant and average MPG. Dual-side climate controls. Smart-key keyless entry and Prius-like "Start" button. MP3 audio plug, although I would have liked a USB connector as well. I am sure I will love the heated seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought a V6 Limited RAV4 to replace a 530i BMWi. I wanted something to perform better in the snow, and I think I have found it. This car is every bit as explosive when you hit the accelerator and it has the benefit of AWD. And the price is right! Handling is superb, cornering is fine and braking is very good. Great combination of features. All in an appealing skin of sheet metal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Strong acceleration, great front-end handling, nicely placed controls and flexible storage with easy to use flip down rear seats. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This was probably the best car that I've ever owned/driven. The Rav4 has everything that you would want or need in a vehicle! Excellent gas mileage at 23 mpg, the best in its class. Very peppy and a tonne of fun to drive! We had a Subaru Tribeca before this, which was OK. But this Rav4 has really shocked me. I want to drive it just for the fun of it! This car really makes the 2 hour drive into work to downtown Ottawa really worth it. Thank you Toyota for designing the perfect car for mostly everyone's needs and all of their wants!</TEXT>
