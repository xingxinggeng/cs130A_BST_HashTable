<TEXT>Although the 2009 looks pretty much like every Prius since the 2004 redesign I think it's still a good looking car. For a small car the interior is spacious, lots of leg room even in the back seat. The seats recline to an almost flat position if needed. The rear seats lay flat opening up the storage space of the hatchback for plenty of storage. Up front there are two glove compartments, a small compartment under the radio, a sunglasses compartment overhead, and two large compartments between the seats. On the road I find the Prius has plenty of get-up-and-go when needed and the touchscreen display gives me the feedback I need to maximize my fuel economy. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>46+ MPG, Bluetooth, touch screen display, lots of storage room, smartkey system, digital speedometer, smooth and quiet ride. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Always had Toyotas until 1999 then got OUTBACK and loved it. Sold it for this new 2009 Prius. Only have 2,600 and HATE the car. Quality is cheap...metal dents easily, interior is cheaply done, little storage room and I am single with one medium sized dog and one little dog...Selling this to buy used low mileage Subaru Impreza...(regret purchase and will not buy another Toyota...they make them too CHEAP now. Shame on them...the old ones were GREAT...pre 1998)...no longer! Hate touch screen..always dirty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just had our 5000 mile maintenance check in out 2009 Prius. We test drove a couple cars before buying the Prius. We love our car. It is comfy and of course the gas mileage is great. When we were looking we had 2 cars in mind to compare (one being the Prius) and the other being a Honda Civic hybrid. We thought we would lean towards the Honda as we owned one before, there is no comparison between the 2, the Pruis won hands down.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've driven my Prius for 36k miles. My love is simply summarized ? 48 MPG! But will fuel savings be lost to unexpected maintenance costs? My car isn?t old enough to have real maintenance issues yet, but I?m wary. The engineers were great at building a complex car with great gas mileage, but lousy at creating a car that can be easily maintained. There's no room under the hood, so there's no way to do a simple DIY like replacing a headlight without extensive work. I tried DIY, but gave up. In the end, the dealer replaced it (in about two hours of labor) for $200+ (for a $10 bulb?!). That?s crazy talk man! People need to know up front that there could be high unforeseen maintenance costs.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel efficiency and environmental friendliness!! Sure there's no pep or sex appeal to it, but it does the job, and does it very efficiently. I'm also pleasantly impressed with the amount of room in what I expected to be a too small interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased our new Prius in Dec 08 and promptly drove from Florida to CA and back. 5900 miles with no problems and $125 in gas costs for the entire trip. Since then we have put another 17000 miles on it with NO problems mechanical or otherwise. I am looking forward to purchasing another in the not to distant future. Excellent value for money. Gas mileage after the first 6000 miles went from 47 highway and 49 city to 48 highway and 51 around town. Got to love the savings. Cruising speed is comfortably up to 80 interstate with no significant loss of economy. A pleasure passing the clunkers going over the great divide.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I cannot say how much I enjoy my 2009 Toyota Prius. I used to drive a Mercedes SUV and never thought of getting used to a smaller car. Honestly I do not miss my SUV or the amount of money that I paid for every service and other things. This car is far beyond of what I expected. I carry same amount of stuffs that I used to carry in the back of my SUV. Just fold the back seats and you got all the room you need. It is a good car for any age group that has a great style. Way to go Toyota. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the Prius 1 June 2009. At first I had trouble getting used to the electronic displays, but after driving one week I became accustomed with them. The most important reason for buying the Prius was its reliability, the CVT transmission and the fuel economy. After driving 1400 miles I am averaging 50 miles per gallon overall. In city driving I get about 45 mpg, I live in a hilly area. On the highway I get about 53 mpg. The electronic display help one economize fuel if you desire so. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the Prius May 2009 and love it. Had one as a rental car for a week and decided then that my next car was going to be a Prius. Thanks to Toyota's 0% interest, I'm not a liar. We are averaging about 46 mpg with mostly interstate driving and some city. I have averaged as high as mid 50's on the interstate while still doing approx 65 mph. I think my wife just has a heavy foot when she drives. Traded in a 07 Civic and WOW, the Prius beats the Civic in every category, especially comfort and performance. I no longer feel like I am driving a college kid's car. The dealer had aftermarket leather installed on the seats, but gave me a great deal on this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the car specifically for maxing out my mpg and it's lived up to its billing. In the 3 months I've been driving it I average 62 mpg city/53 mpg highway/58 mpg combined (well above the combined 47 mpg EPA rating). Comfort and styling are above average in my opinion. Overall power is below average... but I didn't buy this car for the power. Great commuter car as it has already saved me $200 in gas compared to my former vehicle (2005 Toyota 4runner). You can find alternate commuter cars at a better price but not with this much comfort/styling or getting this good of mileage!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1. EV mode allows you to drive gas free under 42 mph (using a feather foot on the GO pedal). 2. For a mid-size car... plenty of cargo room. Seats fold down nicely to allow for larger cargo. 3. Interior designed well with plenty of instrumentation to allow for great mpg's!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have owned 04, 05, 06, 08, 09 Prius. No other car is even close. Very quiet, tracks perfectly, extremely fast. CVT is only transmission to have. Shift by wire is magnificent. Trunk space is incredible. Comfortable. If gas was 20 cents a gallon I would still buy Prius. Will get 2010 next. We have an 08 and 09 at present. Excellent brakes and build quality.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have now owned my Base Prius-Package 6 for 7 mos and 7,700 mi. I love it with a couple of exceptions. First, it is best if you are not over 5'10" sitting in the front passenger seat. Second, the navigation system is a waste (spend $200 on a Garmin). The actual mileage I have had has ranged from 35-37 mpg (winter) to 44-48 mpg in the above freezing months. My dealer said this is a more realistic expectation than the published numbers. Otherwise, it drives great (expect performance commensurate with its horsepower),the interior toys and quality are terrific, and I would definitely buy another one. The leather seat covering is great, but for almost $30,000 I would expect elect. seats.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Keyless entry-starting, screen display of radio, climate control, telephone, nav., and trip/performance computer. Leather seats. Storage well under rear cargo area. HUGE cargo carrying ability with back seats folded down. Backup camera (needed with the large blind spots).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The prius is incredibly economical and the advanced powertrain engineering is very clear. The interior space is exceptionally good, although at 5'11" it would be nice if the driver seat could be moved and additional inch rearward. I have owned SUVs as well as sports cars and sedans, but this is one of the easiest cars I've driven yet. In town this Prius gets 53 MPG and for day to day commuting it handles well. It is not a car that I enjoy driving fast, since at the limit of handling it is a little unsettled. The turn radius is fantastic though, and it understeers predictably through tight fast corners. The acceleration is similar to a mid 70s American sedan - it won't win any races.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only owned the car for a week so I'm still learning how to operate a high tech hybrid vehicle, I drove a similar size car for five years that rode, felt and sounded like a small car. The Prius drives like an upscale mid-sized sedan. It's quiet, comfortable, handles well, and has gotten over 50 mpg in city and highway driving the first week of operation. Fit and finish is outstanding. According to CR, reliability should be well above average. So far, I'm very satisfied with the car. I was interested in waiting for the new 2010 model but was able to save thousands by purchasing one of the last of the 09s.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were not crazy about the design (little more room in the trunk please! - and low rear view visibility) BUT if you are concerned about exposing your kiddies in the back seat to high - quite arguably harmful levels -of electromagnetic radiation and you want a hybrid, then Prius is the car for you. We measure very safe levels in all parts of the car - with only slight raise (several seconds) while breaking. We found very unsafe levels in other hybrid cars we tried and that's why we got a Prius. Toyota obviously has taken precautions to minimize a health risk - even one not generally talked about. Wow. How often can you say that about a big company! Way to go Toyota!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I must say that overall I'm quite happy with my Prius-look, performance, gas mileage-but what the heck was Toyota thinking with those seats?! I eagerly took my brand new Prius on a 200 mile r/t roadtrip (one I do every month) to upstate NY. About 1/2 hr into my ride my back started hurting and my tailbone began throbbing. By the time I got back home that evening, I was in serious agony! I can't believe Toyota put so much attention into the technology-bluetooth, reverse cameras, smart key, the entire hybrid system-and the seats were just a mere afterthought! No lumbar support? Really???? Now I'm in the market for some seats that don't feel like rocks so I can tolerate my 80 mile r/t commute!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We brought the car for its great fuel economy and nothing else. The car isn't cute, the ride is not what we were used to but we knew that. We test drove the Prius many times before buying it. But during our first long distance trip (400 miles) we experienced handling problems. The car wanted to move from side to side, I was constantly adjusting the wheel. There were also cross winds during part of the trip, which made things worst. Spoke to my local Toyota Service department and corporate Customer Service, they indicated the car was "Working as designed". My wife refuses to use the Pruis for long distance highway driving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>2 months later... it's taken that long to get used to the driver's seat and call it comfortable. It is particularly spirited off-the-line until 40 mpg (the electric motor's torque) 40-60 is a little dicey. Once on highway, this car can get out of traffic quickly. Mileage in mixed driving is around 42 mpg. I no longer worry about the gas bladder. I go plenty of miles before fill-up for very little money!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My prius has 10000 miles on it and I average no higher than 36mpg and only 25mpg in the winter. The fuel gauge reads no gas left but when I fill up it only takes 7 gallons to fill its 11.9 gallon tank. The engine is slow, loud, and noisy. For a $30,000 car I expected more. For an extra $5,000 my Subaru Tribeca gets 25mpg highway, power and heated seats, sunroof, AWD, 6 cylinder engine and better safety rating.</TEXT>

I traded in my BMW Z4 for it so I was really worried about it not having enough power since that was what I was used to but I am pleasantly surprised. I have driven it a lot already, about 1,000 miles and have averaged 45.9 mpg mostly freeway.

<TEXT>I have nearly 6,000 miles on my Prius so far and have not yet been able to break the 41 MPG average, despite an 80 mile per day commute - this is disappointing as the sole reason for purchasing the Prius was to gain maximum fuel efficiency. My hopes are that this will change as the weather starts to warm up, but, don't you think Toyota would have accounted for cold weather in the MPG ratings? Otherwise, I enjoy driving the Prius.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Not the typical hybrid owner, but, I love intricate gadgets that make sense and do exactly what is expected and then some and that, is the Prius. You wonder how it can go from so many different modes so seamlessly. I have the Touring which is a little too spirited for a green car, yet, with all that it does on its own, this car very quickly gains its own personality and becomes an object of affection... just can't quite explain it. The bottom line here, out of all the sport/fast/trendy cars I have owned, this Prius is by far the most intuitive machine of them all.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is exactly what it is supposed to be. It is the best hybrid on the market. Toyota built it from the ground up as a hybrid, so it has a distinctive look and great features. I?ve had my Seaside Pearl Prius with Package #6 for 3 months and I love it. All you have to do is get in it and drive. The switching between electric and gas is almost imperceptible. This car has an abundance of amenities that make it fun and interesting. The cabin is very flexible, allowing you to carry passengers and cargo with ease. The acceleration, comfort and ride are great.</TEXT>

<TEXT> I am averaging about 29 mpg in city driving. Admittedly my trips tend to be quite short, but I am by no means driving with a heavy foot. I often coast for blocks when I anticipate a light changing ahead, accelerate slowly, but it seems to make little difference. The car has been tested 3 times so far and the dealerships say it is fine. Since the only reason for leasing this car as opposed to less expensive vehicles was for mileage, I am very disappointed. While the car is quite comfortable and the interior functional, the stereo is of very poor quality. And, contrary to an assertion made, adding a subwoofer improves, but does definitely NOT transform the sound.</TEXT>

It is very easy to drive, and I agree you do have to learn to drive it if you want good gas mileage. The next thing is we will have to tow it back to Mi this spring. We usually towed with all four tired down, now we will be towing with a dolly. Every one says you won't know its back there. All in all I love the car appearance and all.

<TEXT>Might want to look elsewhere if over 6ft tall as I am. Ergonomics have become annoying - rear view mirror mostly in road-level line of sight and legs cramped by non-height adjustable seat. Marginal power up steep hills, and need to give lots of gas to accelerate onto freeway onramps. Otherwise, cruises flats well, very smooth ride, fairly quiet interior. You may wish the gas motor was off all the time since the electric drive is captivating. Car is well built, high quality inside and out, save the lack of seat / steering wheel adjustments. JBL audio system pretty good, not amazing though. At 6ft 3in, I would not buy this car again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Superb fuel economy - 55 MPG average during summer with trips over 20 minutes, easy on throttle. Worst case for me, 45 MPG average in 40F weather with short (5 minute) trips, accessories used. Smart key system rocks, very, very convenient. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having owned a Porsche and Nissan Pathfinder you would think the Prius would be a major step down. Not so! This car is fun to drive, feels sporty, and handles superbly. I've even come to like the unconventional appearance of my state of the art gas saver. Instead of taking the other vehicles I find myself jumping in the Prius. It's very comfortable and fun to drive. No fuss, no muss. We went with option #6 and love the features, controls, and surprising roominess. Simply press the button an go! I can't say enough about this car, it's fun, has plenty of acceleration when needed, rides quietly and smoothly. The 45 mpg is unbelievable but not the only thing impressive about this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Toyota Prius was pretty good, basically a 4 out of 5 in all respects except mileage, and then it was a 5 out of 5 until the very cold weather set in. Mileage went down from 46-50 mpg all the way to mid 30s mpg when it was in the 20s outside. And in the very cold (teens or near zero degrees Farhen) when you use the heater it went down to 27 to 30 mpg. This was a disappointment on all counts with winter and cold weather mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had been driving a 2008 Mercedes C350 fully loaded until today. Average MPG was 20. Then came along the Prius.The Prius caught my eye, especially in light of today's fuel prices, which are always going to go up. Took delivery of my 2009 Prius today. It lives up to the hype and then some. Averaged 55 mpg on the drive home. Incredible!! Interior comfort exceeds the Mercedes. Interior appointments functional, beautiful and fun. Driving experience major fun. Handles great, sound system a wow. Tons of room, I'm 6,1". Superb interstate handling doing 70 mph. An incredibly versatile, functional and fun ride. And that 55 mpg burning regular, just keeps a smile on your face. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive, computer fun to use, spacious interior, plenty of zip on the road, keyless entry, back up camera and of course that wonderful gas mileage tops the cake. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my 09 Prius for 2 weeks and 400 miles. I've driven two round trips of 150 miles each and some city driving and have an average of 52.5 MPG so far. I've read that the mileage goes up significantly after break in. Can't wait!! Feels like I'm driving a concept vehicle. Displays and controls are easy to understand and use. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Smart Key system. Love it, but still reach for my key. I'll learn. The automatic climate control. Set it and forget it, though I try to keep it reasonable based on outside temp to keep mileage up. Energy use and mileage screens. Using to see what gives me best MPG.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Okay, so I've only had my '09 Prius for four days and 200 miles! If this was a preview, then I can't wait until it gets really broken in and the mpg goes up. Saturday we drove 60 miles round trip on flat road and averaged 51.2. Not bad for a rookie. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Smart Key System. No fumbling for keys. Just walk up, get in, and drive off! The air conditioning is so cool...Pun intended. You really do just set it and forget it. The hatch area is just the right height and easy to put in and take out groceries,</FAVORITE>
