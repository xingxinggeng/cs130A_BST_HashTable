<TEXT>I did the Cash For Clunkers deal. I needed a good commuter car since I drive a minimum of 700 miles a week. All you Jerseyites will understand. So far the car has been performing exactly as I wanted. 35 to 36 mpg in mixed driving mostly through the Pine Barrens. I have the auto with cruise control and they are the two items I must have. Comfort is fine. On Star is great so I don't need a cell phone if I break down in the pines or when I hit a deer again. Also got the 5 door which I highly recommend. This car is about utility and the 5 door is the way to go. Get me to work and home, load stuff in when I need to. I bought the car for cheap, reliable transportation. Grade: A+. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Usable space, gas mileage, low cost, electric windows and door locks, radio and CD player, OnStar, good automatic w/cruise, *acceptable* engine performance, warranty.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>$4,300 for 2009 Aveo</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I purchased my Aveo as part of the Cash for Clunkers program after all rebates my price $4,300. Did not need car as had purchased 2008 Civic Hybrid prior year. I have enjoyed the car and believe it is good for my teenagers to experience the manual door locks and manual windows. It has a comfortable riding position and I like the interior. I recently changed my oil and was surprised with canister oil filter and torx socket for drain plug. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design and color. Ride height. Simplicity under the hood. Price. Number of airbags. Ease of changing engine oil.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Where do I begin. I've had nothing but problems w/my car. The RMP's don't idle right. It makes shuddering movements while driving & while stopped. After 1 month of having it, I had a transmission problem and other tiny problems. Buying this car was the worst decision I made. Don't expect a race car, because this car lacks power, very much. Dealership would not fix my car, so I got an attorney & General Motors agreed to buy back the car, so now I'm on the hunt for another. But I will tell you that this car was a pain in the neck the whole 3 months I had it. But I loved the way it looked outside & especially inside its such a nice looking car, just doesn't run the way it's supposed to.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2009 LT sedan Aveo back in May before the cash for clunkers. I love the car for the most part. Mines more of the sport version with a small spoiler, sun roof, leather seats, Alloy rims and a nice deck. I'm just about to hit 9k cause I bought mine with 3k on it. It still running great I like the sedan way more then the hatch back because you get more room. I'm always hitting 30 mpg and on the highway I'm hitting about 34 mpg. Great looking sedan. This was a 2009 Aveo built in 2008.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sun roof, deck with the aux port for Ipod, rims and the size of the car.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>34mpg YEAH right</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>We have had this car for nearly a year. Never once has this thing busted 27mpg. Must have been some good grass the day the EPA got a hold of this one. Rides OK, looks great. Needs power if there is no gas mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks are very nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I cashed in on the Cash for Clunkers deal and got a good deal on the car. I was promised at least 30 mph in town and 35 on the highway. Nada. The first check was 23 mpg, then 20 and today only 21. I'm very disappointed in that ... but surprising good ride for a small car. But I bought it for the gas savings. Now the dealership says give it 10 to 15,000 miles before it will perform as promised. Waiting.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good looking, handles with ease, very surprisingly comfortable ride, fun to drive ... just nifty.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just picked up my fist new car. Picked it up with 100 miles on it and drove 1000 miles to Florida and it ran great. It averaged 35+mpg and that was running 70 mph on interstate. The downside is it runs at 3250rpm running 70 mph seems high but it is not normal driving for me. I normally drive 55 on the highway going to work and should do much better on mpg. LS package has no air, cd, or cruse. It would be nice but for the price I won't complain. 12000 list price - 1000 rebate and - 4500 cash4clunkers = $6500 before tax, title, license. My dad bought a mazda brand new in 1978 for $6700 hard to imagine 30 years later same price for better vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted a compact car with good Gas mileage. I think I got one with this 2009 Aveo. It's fun to drive. It rides better than I thought it would. and I get 32 MPG in the city. I think GM finally has built a good compact car. It has more pick up than I thought it would. Not to good on a up grade but it's a compact car. I only had it for about a month now and I don't think it has any blind spots in it. The side windows are big. The engine runs quiet and it has a good ride on the highway. only one thing wrong with it, made in Korea. If anyone wants a compact car they should take a good look at a Aveo.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Big side windows no blind spots. Seats are comfortable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I loved this car when I seen it, I loved the style and size/shape, I really wanted it in White with black leatherette interior seats but no extras, my salesman did his best to find one to no avail, he told me in a 500 mile radius from Rutherford, nj there was only 2 aveos with leatherette seats and both cars were loaded, oh well, not a big difference in price, my only concern from past experiences is, if it has a lot of extras, if they break u gotta fix them! I love the dark red with beige leatherette seats I finally got, but all the extra bells and whistles intimidate me, the car doesn't have much pickup when accelerating and there's some dings that I hear in the back that I have no idea where its coming.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the onstar, ill probably renew it, I like the leatherette seating and its very roomy, im 6,3'and 300 lbs a big guy and its plenty of leg shoulder and head room. It doesnt really seem good on gas but who knows, I cant tell, I do a lot of driving and I feel like im always putting gas in it</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We were aiming for an econo-box that wouldn't need a major overhaul in the next 3 years(i.e. battery bank)... we're pretty satisfied with what we have here. Fit & finish of the car seems quite nice. The only noise leaks are through the underbody panels because of no insulation/padding. Last 3-5 tanks are in the 35mpg area and we live in & around some hilly terrain... was in the 32mpg area until we changed over to a full synthetic. Currently @ 3000 miles on the car. Onstar is a feature that can spoil you... except for the knowing that they can shut your car off if/when they feel like it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Small; it seems to handle(cornering & maneuvering) quite well; headphone/MP3 input jack; extra 12V port; twice-folding rear seats; decent get-up-&-go when you get above 3500 rpms; roomy; the mpg potential with mods ^_^</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my aveo5 after my brother in law let me drive his. I test drove the nissan versa and honda fit but like the aveo the best. The only problem I had with it was after driving a suv for 10 years I drove the aveo like a suv. The front of the aveo is too low and now I have damage to the front of the car. I now am more cautious. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I enjoyed my Aveo 5 at first. A few months into owning it, it died on me on a winter's night. Vehicle was towed to dealership. Computer was reprogrammed. Before this happened I was getting 35 mpg. Afterward, I'm getting 23 mpg. Have contacted GM and they will do nothing about it. Purchased car for good gas mileage so am very disappointed. My mid size, V6, Saturn Aura gets better mileage than Aveo,a 4 cyl. econo car. Also lots of rattles. Will probably get rid of it at a loss. Sad! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>More room inside than you would think. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had my last vehicle (Chevy Venture) for 11 years and it was time for something new. After spending 3 hours with a local dealership getting the run around I called another dealer about 30 miles away and over the phone he gave me a price $250 less. I had a hard time keeping from laughing every time I look at it and everyone says it's sooo cute but they are impressed with the milage. I had to get the hatchback because I have 2 large dogs that travel with me. The MPG is great (I get about 30) but with a small gas tank I still have to fill it quite often. When my girlfriend saw it she named it a Chevy Buttless and the name stuck. But it is sooo cute for a minicar.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 1 year of Onstar is fantastic and after messing with the radio for a couple of days, it sounds quite good. I have no optional equipment but the mp3 jack on the radio works wonderful for my Ipods. It is quite roomy but I'm short.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I own an Aveo5 2LT, 2009. The drive by wire is a little tough to get used to with the 5 speed, although I have adapted. The leatherette interior is very nice, but the drivers seat is already out of shape and this happened almost from day one. Overall though I am really happy with my purchase. The car is fun to drive and quite comfortable. If you are currently driving a larger car it will take a few days to adjust to the higher RPMs at highway speeds, but you really get a driving experience as opposed to feeling like you are sitting on your den sofa. Great little car for the money!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sound system is very good. Styling gets a lot of compliments. Aluminum wheels much nice than hubcaps. Gauge cluster is nostalgic and very nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>About a month ago, I purchased a 2009 Aveo5 2LT for my daughter. The only options not on the vehicle were leatherette seats and a sunroof. After driving small, medium, and large SUVs for several years, I had forgotten how much fun driving a small car really is. My daughter needed to get to grad school at UCLA and we drove across the country from North Carolina (2700 miles). Since I am 6 feet 3 inches tall (with long legs) I was concerned, but I found it comfortable, quiet, and with good handling, even on the day we traveled 680 miles. I was very pleased with the overall 31 mpg we got on the trip, especially since the little thing was loaded. It cost just $318 in gas for the trip! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The premium radio is worth every cent ? get it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Aveo is attractive and the sound system is decent but it lacks in performance. Mine is only averaging 23 miles a gallon. Wind noise and slow exceration make it a poor choice compared to other cars, but it is cheaper. Mine had a defunct OnStar system (though purchased new with only 15 miles on it) and it took GM six weeks to get the OnStar fixed and reprogrammed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Some "professional" reviews talk about the 5 speed trans being "jerky." At 13 miles on the clock, it was. By 200 miles, it had smoothed out considerably. It could be a mechanical form of tromp loi, but everything sounds solid about the Aveo. The handling is sensitive but precise enough for me. Mileage has been as advertised. Everyone who has ridden with me comments about the roominess and exelent visibility. With the LS you get the basic car and so is reminisent of Pinto, Vega, Colt, Civic of the past (had 'em all) but somehow a little more evolved. The option packages seem a little lop- sided. Time will tell on reliability, but for now I have no issues and enjoy my new ride every day.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar (of course), adult sounding horn, visibility, simple lay-out, plenty of interior room, pedals are well placed, quick for an econobox. Redesigned interior won't look as dated as the old circle design. Standard radio is alright but the rear speakers are going to need replacing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I needed a 4dr hatchback with automatic. My car also has the optional power package with keyless entry. Narrowed my choices to the Aveo, and the 2008 Fit, both of which had some minor pluses over the other. The Aveo has CC, drivers seat height and lumbar adjustments, and an armrest. It also has daylight running lights, an alarm system, and free Onstar for one year. The front end has been redesigned, and the interior has been upgraded. The engine has a few more horses with improved gas mileage. I have been averaging 30 MPG in mixed driving, and the engine turns 2800 RPM at 70 MPH. Generally quiet with some road noise. Very roomy, great visibility, nice handling, and good acceleration.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The OnStar system which also has a hands free phone system. Stereo has six speakers, auxillary jack, and 180 watts of power. Ease of entry, hardly need to bend to enter or exit. Nice looking interior, albeit mostly plastic. Overall my Aveo has been a pleasant surprise.</FAVORITE>
