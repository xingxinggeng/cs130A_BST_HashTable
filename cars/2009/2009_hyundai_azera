<TEXT>I've had the car 5 months, put over 5,000 miles on it, and have found two faults. Sunlight falls on the navigation/audio screen with near blinding effect, and substantial road noise occurs at interstate speeds. That's it. I enjoy driving the car so much that I usually regret reaching my destination. Initially the ride was hard but the cause was simply over inflated tires. Unexpectedly at 5K miles I have had a significant uptick in mileage and now get well over EPA average. I am so "sold" on Hyundai now that I expect to move up to the very quiet Genesis with my next purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like almost everything so well that it is difficult to speak of favorites. I like the interior, especially the wood trim. The capacious trunk has been useful for carrying a wheel chair of late. The power is smooth and ample. All features integrate in to a very pleasurable whole.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was actually looking at the new Genesis, but financially the Azera was a better fit for me. I think it is a mistake for Hyundai to discontinue this car because it fits right between the Sonata and Genesis on price point, but oh, well........... Very happy with my choice and Hyundai of New Bern is the best!!! I love this car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mileage for a V6, Bluetooth and GPS and it comes with XM radio. I have used that for 3 years so glad to have it integrated.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is one great car except for the city MPG which I am getting only 13-14 mpg. On a trip to the Hyundai factory in Montgomery AL. I averaged 27MPG which is respectable. That plant is really something to see and worth the 650 mile trip each way. My poor gas mileage is on file with my dealer, Maybe I have a lemon which I am following up on. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fit and finish for 1000's less than competition, XM radio,folding side view mirrors, power. Very comfortable car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It is possible to find faults with this car. At interstate speeds road and wind noise are substantial. Sun light falls on the audio/navi screen making it almost unreadable. Otherwise the car is a pure delight to drive. I normally regret reaching my destination. The car is attractive, comfortable, powerful, and has many amenities. Cabin and trunk are spacious also. Just what I wanted excepting the two features mentioned above.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>No one feature stands out. All features mentioned above integrate into a most enjoyable driving experience. If you count price as a feature then that is standout. I would have had to pay thousands more for a similar auto.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is an amazing great car with unmatched value. My wife and I absolutely love it. Our friends are very impressed. We've owned it for 4 months and I waited until now to do the review. At 3500 miles, with majority (~80%) highway driving, the long-term mileage has been 24 mpg. As the flagship for Hyundai until the Genesis, one clearly senses that a whole lot of thought had gone into the design, and care into the build of this car. So far, this has been the most issue-free car I've owned, including Camrys and Accords. There are people who would rave about this car if it was a luxury brand, but are more reserved as a Hyundai product. The Azera should be continued, to convert these skeptics. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car is roomy, smooth, luxurious, and great-looking. The folding mirrors, Bluetooth, rear-window shade, wood accents, rain-sensitive wipers, etc. are all wonderful features. Above all is the music. The Infinity system is awesome. One can immerse themselves in XM music like no other experience.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought this fine vehicle on August 4th,2008 and been very satisfied with it in all respects except one - a bumpy shift from lower gears to drive. While I find this to be irritating it still does not diminish my enjoying my Azera. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior fit, finish and standard accessories that are furnished with this vehicle are an outstanding value. Trip mileage has been in the 25 to 26 mpg range.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchase the Hyundai Azera Limited after having a Camry for only 15 months (which also was purchsed new) The Azera Ltd. has much more power with just scacrificeing a mile or two MPG. The ride is top knotch and the sound system is awesome. Braking is aggressive. The "manual" shift mode is fun on the twisty roads. Fold-in mirrors is a great auto car wash feature. I found out that the Sun Screen in the back window is not only good on sunny days, but also a benefit when the guy behind you has his brights on. So far this car has been a pleasure to drive and own.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Kicking sound system, great ride, plenty of get up and go, rear sun screen, Michelin tires on alloy wheels and plush interior make up a wonderful package and driving experience.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having come from a heavy Lincoln Town Car with a 205HP engine, I can say that I would be happy with the 233HP engine. With the 263HP engine, it's a rocket. The drive-ability is amazing. It's very sure footed, even in the rain. It's not unusual for me to drive over 500 miles in a day. This car is comfortable on those long hauls. With slightly more than 20K miles on the car, nothing - nothing - has gone wrong!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1. Smooth ride 2. Heated leather power seats. 3. Automatic windshield wipers. 4. The sound system. 5. The fit and finish; inside and out.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a beauty! One option package includes everything. The fit and finish is excellent. Whomever rides in it has nothing but raves.I have had this car for only 21/2 weeks and have not found a thing wrong with it. The price with all thw whistles and bells is so far below the competitions price. The public does not know what they are missing. It was the top of the Hyundai line but probably will be replaced by the Genesis which goes for about $40,000. Too bad! I'll write follow- up in 6 months and see if I still love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Memory seat,Adjustable gas peddle,rear sun shade, smooth ride,comfortable seats,sound system, Warranty. Just one great car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>While the fit & finish are nice, I find the front driver's seat to be extremely uncomfortable and I'm only 5'9". The auto headlights are sensitive enough; the auto windshields wipers behave erratically; the heating- /A/C defaults to A/C "compressor on" and most of the settings on the trip computer reset every time you start the car. On top of that, the Check Engine Light came on after only 24 hours with the car. had it only 3 weeks but considering a trade in. On the whole disappointed by the little things.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is amazing! I have a 1999 tiburon - which I love. That was the best car I have ever had - so I knew I wanted another Hyundai. I was looking at the sonata - then I spotted Azzy. There was no going back! The price - for all the features was terrific. I did look at the Genesis - just for fun - but to tell the Truth - I still preferred the azera. I have had no problem with the suspension. Best of all-this is a car that "fits" me. The controls for the seats - with a memory is amazing - and the pedals move too! I don't have to try to get my seat perfect time and time again after "he" drives it. "He" insists he loves his ugly Chevy truck - but he jumps in my car every chance he gets!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Where do I start - the Navigation system is great. I love the heating/cooling DUAL system - and the fact that it adjusts itself. The power side mirror and the luxurious look of the interior with the dark cherry wood accents. The automatic windshield wipers are great too and the automatic lights!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This will be my 3rd Hyundai. My Son drives my old 2003 Sonata with 160K on it. I traded my 07 Santa Fe AWD for this car as I commute to work almost 100 miles a day and need better MPG's. I didn't need or want the Limited as the GLS have all the options I preferred. I have owned it only a couple days and the mileage is 25 mpg but that is a lot of highway. I expect even better once the car is broke in. If you are looking for an Azera, the deals are out there. I got about 5K off the MSRP. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The comfort and ride of a full size sedan. The Bluetooth is a great feature and works perfect. Very nice XM radio. Trip meter. Nice size trunk.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>From the initial test drive, the car didn't inspire a lot of "oh-wow!" comments, but it was an interesting design. Seats leave a little bit to be desired in terms of thigh support, and the leather stitching on the black (gray) leather is ugly. But, I basically love this car. Bluetooth works great. Trunk size is very good. I have some problems with the transmission at slow speeds, as I drive the Washington DC beltway each day. But, overall I would definitely buy this car again. Without doubt, this is one of the greatest values available.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Memory seats, interior and trunk dimensions, interior displays, general comfort in the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This past year's 15,000 mile driving experience has been extremely enjoyable in our new azera ltd/ultimate. It gives great performance on regular gas. It included a 4700 mile trip of the maritimes (24.6 mpg), a 2667 mile trip to Baton Rouge, la. ( 23.8 mpg), and a 1961 mile to branson, mo. (22 mpg). On regular gas, the 5 speed automatic transmission, plus the dohc 3.8 liter al block v6 was much lighter on the front end, and performed better than the supercharged 3.8 cast iron block (premium gas) 1997 olds lss (4 speed automatic) car it replaced. In over all fact the much more completely featured azera was purchased in current dollars for less than my cost for the (new) 1997 olds. Great buy for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This is, into it's fourth year, the best car buy for money. With the ultimate feature package you get customer adaptability features (my wife has arthritis) you only find in premium cars selling for tens of thousands of dollars more (eg. Acura rl). This is the best car buy I have found in fifty years.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have owned a 2009 GLS with the Premium Package for 2 months/1,600mi. Didn?t need the extra bells and the larger engine, so saved a few $$$. Comfortable ride and generously sized for 2 teens in the back seat. Does not feel big and is easy to park and maneuver in traffic. Plenty of power on hills (we live at 6,800 ft in Colorado and go up and down in elevation constantly), plus an average 21-22mpg on about 50/50 city/hwy driving. (yes, I do drive it nicely) There is plenty of power available if you choose to use it. I was quite surprised when I ?jumped on it? the first time-got up to speed in no time! We did look at Honda, Toyota and Nissan and are happy with our decision.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It?s a nice, comfortable, fun to drive sedan. The iPod connection is wonderful</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted the Azera ever since they came out and finally purchased the loaded Limited with navigation. The car is fantastic; fun to drive. great firm suspension with a sports car feel; interior is top notch. The many features you get with the Limited would cost a fortune if purchased with a BMW or Lexus. I'm looking forward to t nice road trip to the Florida Keys in April and expect to get 27 or so MPG. The 3.8 ltr engine is real quick and powerful. Passing on the interstate is easy. You have to remember to check the speedometer because 80 and 90 mph comes up before you realize it. You can't go wrong with the Azera.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Too many: heated seats, power folding mirrors and tilt/telescoping steering wheel and pedals, super engine, auto lights and wipers, large trunk, just everything.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The driving is fun. Powerfull car nice well finish lots of details making this car amazing. The suspension is not so great, is very stiff so if you don't like the feel of the road "Do not purchase this car" I can't wait to trade in for some other and remember I purchase this car not even 3 months ago.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 5 cd mp3 charger is nice very easy to use easy acces control to change stations.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My '09 Azera Limited offers alot of bang for the buck. I have owned 6 Hyundais previously, including a '99 Elantra, '03 Sonata, '04 XG350L, '05 XG350L, '08 Sonata GLS and an '08 Sonata SE V-6. The Azera is second best only to the Genesis. I love the features that the Limited offers including the 12 speaker Infinity sound system, smooth 3.8L V-6, roomy interior, smooth ride and great handling in the snow and on the ice. This vehicle has LESS wind and road noise than an Infiniti M45x. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth V-6. Infinity sound system. ESC and Traction control. Power rear sunshade. Large trunk and backseat. Electroluminescant gauges. Adjustable pedals. Power folding mirrors.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After two weeks of reading automobile reviews and visiting showrooms I came to the conclusion that the vehicle that had the most to offer for a very reasonable price was the Hyundai Azera. This sedan has everything that I was looking for, style both inside and out, performance and price. We bought our Azera Limited in early August and already have driven it over 4,000 comfortable and enjoyable miles. It is, in my opinion, one of the best values available to anyone in the market to buy a new car today. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The design and craftsmanship are superb. There are so many features that are included as standard and not add on.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did the research online and with Consumer Reports. Came down the Azera or the Toyota Avalon. Drove the Avalon, nice ride but handling was way to mushy. The Azera was much tighter, lots of power. Car has every option except bluetooth. Incredible trunk space. Drove it from Colorado to my folks in Nebraska with my Wife, Daughter, SIL and Grandson. Babying it on the interstate I got 31mpg, coming home with that load and 100lbs of apples at 75mph constant I got 27mpg. I would have like more mpg, but the available power is incredible. Haven't driven anything this much fun since my 71 Firebird. The heating/AC is great, dash and instrument layout is great. 10Y/100K warranty, closed the deal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance is outstanding. Interior comfort, amenities and instrumentation is outstanding. Exterior styling in my mind is great, but that's just MHO. Had it for 6 weeks now and no cons other then MPG, I was hoping for better at 75mph. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I researched and drove all of the competitors in the full size market. None compared favorably with the features and creature comforts that the Azera offered. It was as much or more comfortable. The interior touches and controls are logical and well designed. The reported issues with the suspension and noise are non-existent in my 2009 LTD. It is exceptionally quiet and the sound system is awesome. The rear sun- shade and memory driver seat make it a joy to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Memory Driver Seat and the passenger side power seat (not available in most cars unless you pay alot more for it). Th Luminescent and Blue interior lighting makes night driving pleasurable. The Ipod and USB Ports are very handy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After hearing so many of friends rave about their Hyundais I finally decided to investigate when I needed to replace my 2000 Volvo V40. Well, I was equally impressed, with both the reviews and the car. I wasn't planning on buying right away but the value of price & luxury that the Azera offered was too tempting & I have not been disappointed at all after having the Azera for just a week. I have put on over 600 miles on it already. Plush seating, fantastic sound system, more than ample interior space, plenty of power when needed along with stylish looks. This is by far the nicest most "decked" out vehicle I've ever owned & it didn't break my bank either! It blows my old V40 away in every way!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Awesome sound system with 605 watts, Infinity speakers, XM, IPod, MP3...Fantastic! Bluetooth for the phone, heated seats, LED lights, electric swivel side mirrors, memory seats, adjustable pedals, roomy trunk. What's not to like, the car is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just a quick update since my post of 06-01-2008. I am still happy with my decision. I have since had the chance to take the car on a thousand mile trip. The car rode very well and my MPG was 26 @ about 80 to 85 miles per hour. So thus far the car has worked as advertised, I am very pleased.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features remain the same, love the sound system and I would add the roominess of the cabin and trunk to my list of favorites.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just got the 2009 Azera Limited two days ago, thus far I am pleased with my decision. Being an old mechanic I had a hard time making the decision to buy a Hyundai. I always told my customers to buy Toyota, Honda, or Nissan, but after doing some research and driving the car I will add Hyundai to my list of cars I recommend. I was considering the Toyota Avalon Limited, but for about $6,000.00 less I got a comparably equipped Hyundai. The only difference I noticed was the Avalon had a quieter ride, but not enough so to justify the price difference. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 3.8 L engine, price, and the upgraded Infinity sound system. I was also pleasantly surprised to learn that the Navigation system will play a DVD as well as CD's. Also like the rear power sunshade. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have you ever been outside on a hot July summer night. The street is warm, and the wind is at a stand-still. Then all of the sudden a car whisp by and you don't even see it. That is what happpens when the new Hyundai azera comes through. People don't know what happened. The design is one of a kind. It has a 3.8 liter, or 3.3 liter. Enough hp's to throw your head back. The leather is smooth. Really if it had a Honda or Toyota tag, the dealership could not get enough models in stock. So I recommend this car. You shoul go drive drive.</TEXT>
