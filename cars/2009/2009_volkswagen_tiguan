<TEXT>After researching what kind of SUV I wanted, I decided on the Tiguan. Happen to be in Florida on vac, they had a good deal, I bought and drove the car to New York. Drive was a lot of fun. Vehicle seems solid, firm ride. I get asked about it by passerbys. Brake is very responsive, quite interior. Some minor issues I do have: motorized driver reclining seat, but manual pump lever to elevate and move seat..why not motorize all, summer humidity seems to bring out a bad smell from air exhaust when it's not on a/c, engine is powerful, but there seems to be a delay in responsiveness when u go from braking to quickly accelerating, but then it eventually picks up when you press harder on the pedal</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the interior and exterior look, Good quality interior finish even with the cloth option, 6 mo free satellite radio, firm ride, minimal road noise, sturdy roof frame construction. SE was the better option for me since it came with many standards.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got my 2009 Tig in may of 2008 before better deals were to be had. Oh well... I love the car itself. It has been great and I get complements on it all the time. People stop me to ask about it. I sometimes wish I would've splurged and gotten the one with the sunroof. The car is great in city and hwy and I'm amazed at how well it insulates outside noise. Feels very solid throughout. I agree with some comments about the black upholstery, it is a hair magnet. I had an issue with a faulty fuel pump which was quickly replaced under warranty. That's been the only issue I currently have 11K miles in the Tig.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After one year... I love the power, handling and design of this car. I was looking for a sporty, fast cuv that could still accommodate a three year old and all that entails. This car does that. That being said, driving home from the dealer I noticed (it was at night) I could only see 3 ft ahead of me. Took car back to find lights were ill- positioned. 6 months later I had to get the fuel pump replaced. Already had to get burned out drivers head lamp replaced and there is an awful squeek inside that I can't seem to find/fix. I like the car but am wary about what to expect in year 2. Imo, quality is really lacking. I am thinking of trading it in already, which saddens me as it is fun to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my new White SE Tiguan for 1 month and I am really enjoying driving again. I sold my 9 year old Camry and do not miss it one bit (it was very reliable but BORING, yet the gas mileage was great). I can't rate the reliability yet, but so far I am very pleased, and no real quality issues to address, but I do agree that the Turbo is rather jerky at times and leaving from a stop light turning right it is jerky accelerating to get going, almost like I am driving a stick in a low gear (which I do not have the manual, and I have no need or desire to use the shifting option). The dealer really came down on the sticker price - I got the pricing below a comparable Honda CRV/or RAV4. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I came from a Land Rover LR3 to a 2009 Tiguan. Love the same features of the Land Rover, but disappointed about the room inside. I have (2) dogs and cannot fit much else except them. Also cannot get over the fact there are no armrests in the middle, having to use the console seems odd. Also just ran over a nail on one of the tires and have to have it replaced. The 18" Pirelli's that are on the Tiguan are on national backorder - odd sized tire as well. Not sure if they are good snow tires from what I have researched on the Pirelli website. Gas mileage not what I expected, only averaging 21 mpg on the highway. Overall not quite sure I made the best choice. Should have stayed in my LR3</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded down from a full size SUV to the Tiguan one month ago and absolutely love it. Getting about 20 - 22 mpg in mostly city driving, so a really nice improvement from 13-14 previously. Car drives very sporty, plenty of room inside for a 6' 4'' driver with kids in the back seat. Styling and design are good. My kids like riding in this car better than the BMW 5 series.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Shame on us for not taking a closer look at the car during delivery, after we arrived home we noticed holes in the front bumper. Apparently the car was transferred from a dealer in a state that required front licence plates, in Michigan they are not required. First call was to the dealer - "sorry nothing we can do, but good news we do have a new bumper in stock if you would like to buy a replacement". Well, OK, then. So step two: call VW customer support. They happily assigned a "customer advocate" who called the following day. To quote: "sorry but this is an issue between you and the dealer, there is nothing we will do!" - WOW - what a great case study poor for customer support. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I suppose I had higher expectations since my other vehicles are classy sedans or coupes. Going from a sedan or coupe to one of these SUVs is not something a "driver" would be happy with. It's great for tossing large objects into, but even then, a minivan is better suited to people that want to haul stuff, including people. Otherwise, it's just another "L" on wheels. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched a number of crossovers. Ford Edge, Mazda cx-7, audi q5, nissan rouge, toyota venza, ford escape, saturn vue, honda crv. The Tiguan was the one that gave me the best value, the best handling, free scheduled maintenance, and VW reputation. The back seat is comfortable for adults to ride.

<TEXT>This vehicle is awesome. The drive is very tight for its class and the appointments are similar to my Passat 4-motion wagon. The 4-motion is a definite plus and the ride is superb. It is definitely not a car for the everyday Joe or Jane and thats the way my wife and I like it. I can't imagine a 200 HP Rogue, Rav4, or CRV. I feel this vehicle sits similarly to a land rover but with a lower, more stable center of gravity. There are no unnecessary and gaudy amenities which would push up the price for many other makes. Plus, its a VW and you can't touch that. I do wish that a diesel version was available but I'll just have to wait, hope, and wish for the 2011 model to be a TDI. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Tiguan after several months of looking at small SUV's. Each time I kept coming back to the Tiguan. I thought I would get a CRV, but the power isn't there and there are far too many on the road. I wanted to like the Acura RDX as an Acura TL owner. While I liked it, the gas mileage (poor) and cost (high) prevented the deal. The Ford Escape Hybrid just didn't have the fit and finish. The Tiguan was the best bet for me: good value, my bike fit inside, still somewhat uncommon on the road, nice looking, and just a great all around package. Six weeks into it and I still love it as much as the day I bought it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The gas mileage is much better than the sticker shows. I am getting 22 mixed driving and consistently getting 30 on the freeway. The interior is nice and the cargo area is good with the seats down. Exterior styling is strong. Overall VW quality seems good so far.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have driven 30,000 miles in the deserts of Las Vegas and get 22 -23 MPG aroung town and 26 - 28 on the highway. I have had the services done and am sitting at the dealer having the 30 mile service performed as I write this. Th rear brakes need to be changed at $270 and the front are still 80%. All the tires are still good. 30,000 miles and the front brakes are at 80%, this is awesome. Look up brakes on the Toureg and you will see every 15k to 20k miles at 4 times the cost of the Tiguan. This SUV has been flawless, you cannot go wrong. I test drove the CRV and love the looks, however, the interior seemed cheap and the ride was not as quite. I cannot praise the vehicle enough.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>30K miles front brakes at 80% new $270 for the rears. Thats awesome! MPG for a nice riding SUV is respectable. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>All in all very happy with this new purchase, coming from a BMW I have high expectations but I was surprised with how much I liked this CUV.

<TEXT>After almost a year and a half of research, I finally decided to go with the VW Tiguan. Moving from a Ford Explorer AWD V8, this is definitely a change. The Tiguan is lower so its height is somewhere in between a mid-size SUV and a car. The ride is great considering the wheel-base, yet still offers plenty of room for four adults to travel comfortably. The 4 cylinder has obviously less power, but it'll move when it's needed. I was initially worried about cargo space, and while it is certainly smaller than what I'm used to, it allows for most common trips the store without having to put the seats down. All in all, very pleased. I'm hoping this vehicle lasts for a while.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Build quality and performance are on the top of my list. Reliablity, we'll see as time goes on but at this point everything is spot on with the Tiguan. Surprisingly nimble, although the Michilein tires on the S model are not up to the handling capabilities of the chassis. At 6'4" comfort is not a problem in this CUV, good leg and head room, cargo capacity is as expected but much more than my sports sedan I traded in. Interior materials, seats dash and carpets are very good quality as are fit and finish of the exterior. Color match on the rear fascia is slightly off color for the White Gold but not enough to complain over.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Turbo 2.0T engine and the 6spd Auto. Great fun, just point and shoot. Even with a heavy foot I average 22 mpg in mixed driving using premium fuel only, I've recorded upwards of 27 mpg. highway on a couple of short trips. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Moving from larger suv but wanted all its features minus size. This suv fits the bill. Excellent fit and finish. The 4-cylinder turbo is the best of its class. The ride is stiff but ergonomically sound. The Tiguan has highest rating on all categories of safety including roof strength by the IIHS. Interior is thoughtfully planned out. You pay more for this vehicle versus the other small suvs out there but you get more.</TEXT>

<TEXT>IMO the tiguan wins Best in Class. It is the ONLY vehicle in comparison that Ive found comfortable, font and back for tall people. Im 6'4 and the Tig is the sweetest ride Ive tested outside of the full sized SUVs. Editors seem to only have two complaints - the price tag is higher and it has marginally less cargo space. I cant argue the sticker - but lets be honest. Yes, that will sacrifice 2MPG, but the solid acceleration and grip on the road is the benefit. Cargo space? If the difference is that important you should probably be looking at the full sized. Great VW !</TEXT>

<TEXT>I moved up from a compact car to a compact SUV to accommodate my growing family and deal with the decaying CA roads. The Tiguan is right-sized for urban life in the Bay Area, quite compact exterior for nimble driving and parking, but a very spacious interior. In comparison, Rav4 and CRV are weird/dull/dated. I had hopes for the Forester but the interior was extremely cheap - read the reviews. The Tiguan is in a class of its own for build quality, design, and driving experience. More expensive yes but better value as I will be enjoying this for many years. The 2.0T engine is fantastic, I feel I have the GTI from my youth wrapped in a responsible family package with all safety features.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Space in rear seat - panoramic roof has limo like wow factor. Practical VW design: Sliding rear seats allow more trunk space. Fold flat rear and passenger seats.

<TEXT>I have the SE level with the sunroof. There is no words to describe how fun to drive this car can be. The quality of materials is obvious along with the beauty of designs. Pick up is amazing and smooth and the suspension is the perfect combination between sport and sedan. Not only were the dealers at VW ready to deal, the financing was great. I get compliments on this car all the time, people stare at it on the road too. I am very happy I purchased a car that is not ubiquitous and that allows me the freedom to enjoy rides with the sunroof fully open.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first SUV. I agonized over it because of the mpg. I needed a bigger vehicle, but something smaller than the CRV/RAV4 - also with a nicer interior. I tried to love the CRV because my Civic was such a good car, but couldn't. VW is built much better. The steering freaked me out a bit at first but I'm getting used to it. I don't understand why at times it feels disconnected from the car. It does drive like a car and I like the boost from the turbo engine. Headlights from larger vehicles no longer shine in my rear view mirror or to be deluged by water when larger vehicles would pass me on wet highways. Hopefully my love will continue to grow and I'll feel better about getting such low mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 07 Altima SL in for this car and so far so good. I wish it had a few more bells and whistles for the price tag but other than that it's great. It's a little bit tight on interior space but for right now it's a good fit for my family of 4. Seating is comfy, has a descent stock stereo system with an ipod adapter. I got mine with the 3 years of free maintenance which will save me a few hundred. Overall I'm happy with this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's no GTI, but for a CUV it is the best out there in its price range. Handling and composure on all road surfaces is excellent. Not skittish like the RAV4 V6, and better gas mileage than the Acura RDX. Fit and finish is better than the Honda CRV. Comfortable and quiet interior, controls are simple and in the right places. The 2.0T motor is smooth and refined with plenty of kick when you need it. And don't be put off by the high MSRP as large discounts can be had. Flemington VW was awesome, with no pressure and knowledgeable salespeople.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling/ride balance. Smooth engine and the comparatively slick 6 speed automatic transmission. Simple controls, panoramic sunroof, and seat heaters (with cloth seats) are nice interior features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I think the positives of this vehicle have been covered pretty thoroughly to this point. For me, it was this or a CRV, and the deal I received from VW just crushed what Honda was willing to do. Sticker on my SE was 29,115. Final purchase price was 25,604. Both of the preceding figures are pretax. I put $2000 down and financed the remainder @ 0% for 60 months. Honda thought I was making stuff up, $3600 off MSRP plus 0% for 5 years. VW is definitely trying to move inventory, I guess Honda isn't desperate enough yet. I absolutely love the vehicle though, but I've only had it for a week so reliability is tough to judge at this point. Absolutely zero buyer's remorse to this point.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wanted a GTI but rear seat room was just too small. Manual transmission and higher ingress/egress makes this fit my desire for fun and my need for comfort. Would have preferred a manual transmission with the ability to also have nav, sunroof, heated seats and AWD, but VW did not give me that option. I have found base 'S' model's cloth seats do not get as cold as leather seats so I have not yet gone to the aftermarket for heated seats. It is more quiet than my BMW and Chevy Tahoe. It tracks well and has lots of storage cubbies, including a hidden one to the left of steering wheel. Drawers under the seats like the European models would have been nice. Bring on the TDI with a stick!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auto Hold feature is great for teaching my daughter to drive a stick. All controls are intuitive to use and right where they should be. Smooth manual transmission is great, but the power and handling is what sold me. Came down to 2009 Subaru Forester or Tiguan and VW was just more fun to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our 2nd Tiguan, which we picked up just in time to use the 4-Motion against New England snow. Incredible! Very sure-footed in this slop, & a real hoot to drive. The kids love the panoramic moon-roof... it is about as much exposure one can have to the sky without getting a convertible. The Tiguan's Xenon headlamps have peripheral sidelights which activate and illuminate the sides of the road whenever you make a turn. Very nice to have on twisting roads, sharp corners, dark parking lots, city streets, etc. The Tiguan is also a very quiet car for the small SUV/CUV segment. No high pitched whine & road-noise like I experienced with the Toyota RAV4 and CRV. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior and exterior fit & finish is flawless & well thought-out. No confusing & gratuitous console arrays of knobs or clunky plastic buttons that plague other cars in this segment. Controls are clean, functional, & exactly where they should be. The back seat compartment is cavernous.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the first Tiguan to hit Colorado in May. I have put 32000+K miles on it and I love it! I am in sales, drive 50+K miles per year and insist on being comfortable. It is such a fun car to drive but I have picked up 2 speeding tickets since purchasing the car. The sunroof is great!! 6 cd stereo is great!! When I use Super gas I get 28+mpg - it drops to 23mpg when I cheap out on the gas. Stock tires are not so great - I already need a new set. The car has a tendency to slide in the snow even with AWD - breaks do need to be checked. Upgrade from the "Sports Cloth" seats - I wish I had been warned that the cloth shows EVERYTHING and dog hair does not come off. </TEXT>

<TEXT>An update to my original post in June of 08. This car is still doing everything I expect and then some. I have used premium since day 1 and haven't thought different. This car still gets me roughly 26-27mpg (goin 70mph down the highway), I still love the comfort of the automobile (drove to Myrtle Beach and back from DC, and was very comfortable with 3 other adults, luggage, and 2 golf bags). The style is still cool and I don't regret one thing about this car. The quality is great, the ride is smooth, and its still fun for me. There is ample storage space (I don't have sunroof) and its VERY safe (read the safety ratings that came out last year and see who was on top). Great car, I love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Picked up our new White Gold w/Beige SEL 4-Motion a week ago but had to drive 4+ hours to get it due to the non-availability of what we wanted in our area. Great vehicle and I broke a personal cardinal rule about buying a car the first year it's offered because I was so impressed with it. The rear-view camera didn't work but the techs at my local dealer found a loose connection behind the radio. They rebuilt the connection and it works just fine. There is also some wind noise from the roof rails. There is plenty of room and comfort front and back and the acceleration & handling is fantastic. We'll see how the mileage works out as it breaks in over the next month or so</TEXT>

<TEXT>My 09 SEL has only been home 2 days. I must say going from the Touareg to the Tiquan was a step down for me. But the cost of gas plus the 1800 brake job on the Touareg made up my mind quick. I think dealers should disclose the high cost of maintenance. You can rest assured I checked out the cost to replace brakes on the Tig! I love all the features! Opted not to have the nav sys. Rather use my phone nav. Have everything else. With the limited supply and end-of-year incentives (they were gr8), had to settle for the blue-pretty though. The only down side I experienced was the negotiation at the dealer! I HATE that part of purchasing a car! Otherwise, I am happy so far! Happy Drivin VW Folk!</TEXT>

<FAVORITE>I love the great sound of the radio system, with Sirius. Love the panoramic sunroof, and of course the 4cyl turbo can get you down the road quickly. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First VW since my 1974 rust bucket bug. Love the power, handling, utility and the price. I bought the base model with the manual tranny. This is one really fun and tight ride. An excellent balance of comfort and crisp handling. I have owned an acura, Nissan, Chevy, Ford and nothing compares to the quality so far. I know VW critics abound, for good reason (and that is why I bought the extended warranty) but I have known quite a few VW'ers who have had good luck w/ their vehicles. Don't know what noir authentique is talking about with the "cargo area is useless" comment, but this is a compact with very Nice interior room for the passengers and I fit 9 full size cases of beer in the cargo area.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I normally do not rate a vehicle until I have 30K+ miles on it but I just had to share my pleasure with this vehicle with you. I currently have 8K miles on this SE with no problems. I'm a salesman and I'm on the road alot for my job hauling good size samples. Not as much room as my previous 4runner (which my wife now drives) but enough room to get the job done. Back seat room is larger than you would think and the rear split seats fold down flat which works well for me. Really a nice ride, fun to drive, gas mileage as advertised, and the 4motion has really been a champ in this tough Midwest winter. I drove about everything in this class but I kept coming back to the Tiguan. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just picked up my new 2009 VW Tiguan SE 4Motion! What a great little CUV. Yes, I compared it with all the other little utes. Really it came down to this or the Mitsu Outlander for me in terms of features for the money. That was a great car also, but just can't compare to the build quality or upscale feel of the Tiguan. If I was 20 again, I would go with the Outlander. Now in my 30's, the Tiguan's the ride for me. It was hard to find one with the new Nav system (which is super cool) and the giant sunroof (also super cool), but I am glad I did. Has just the right balance of power and fuel economy, but it is a blast to drive. Drives a lot more like a car than a RAV4. Test drive one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Coming from a 2002 Toyota RAV4 which was 100% reliable, I can say this so far has not been the SUV I imagined. The test drive went well at Potamkin VW. I like the interior and exterior design- typical clean design. The interior has a few cheap pieces but you get used to it. On par with the Toyota. The inside is quite roomy but the seats are not so comfortable. Cargo area is useless. With 4k miles- the power around town is peppy but it lacks power on the highway. I also notice the gas goes quicker than expected. It should average 21 MPG and I barely see 15MPG average. On the highway I have seen 23 with the cruise set at 60MPH. Around town it dips to 12-13MPG. Overall, not the best small SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just drove home our brand new Tiguan! Extremely happy with our purchase. Solid car with quiet ride and comfortable drive. The power of 2.0 liter turbo, compared to other Crossover/SUV's in its class, outperforms the blender-type engines of the smaller 4 cyl. competitors. The full sunroof with automatic screen/shade ads a touch of class to the features. Body style says versatile yet sporty. Plenty of room for stroller or Golf Bags with the fold down seats. After countless hours of research on the internet and test driving all options, this is the one! Get your hands on a Tiguan before showrooms run out (we got the last one on the floor for the trim we wanted).</TEXT>

Novelty retractable screen panel under sunroof does not fully block overhead sun glare. ?Trunk? storage tray on website never materialized - rear underneath storage very ltd.

Another example of VW's world renown "quality" or just an isolated incident? Who knows. Just be aware. Up to that point we were waiting to be towed to the nearest dealership, I would have to agree with everyone else's initial impressions. It seems like a quality car, handles like a much smaller car, and is just a pleasure to drive and use. The tight design of the exterior really belies what is a comfortable interior. </TEXT>

Neither cold in winter nor hot in summer (this is a blessing in Chicago) plus it's got heated seats. I love this car though it eats a lot of gas compared to the AUDI A4 2.0T CVT. I drove 30 mpg with same engine in the Audi and get barely 23/24 with the Tiguan. Tranny does not help at all. CVT or DSG (VW) S-tronic (AUDI) is the way to go. AISIN tranny from the Tiggy eats up more gas, also my AUDI was FWD which was more gas saving but this is why I bought the 4motion (just in time b4 winter).

Also has the same excellent standard radio/CD/mp3 that was in my Passat. Matter of fact any Passat 2006-8 owners will find a number of similarities in the Tiguan. While the SE and SEL with options might be a little pricy the Tiguan S with automatic is a bargain considering all the standard features and build quality.

<TEXT>I love the 2.0 Turbo in the Tiguan! Had the same engine in my 2006 Passat and love both the engine and transmission. The transmission is smooth and the turbo gives you that needed boast in passing or that extra acceleration you need when you?re entering a busy highway, and beats out all the competitors when it comes to acceleration. A little pricey, but the Tiguan S isn?t badly priced considering all the standard features and the quality of the build. The interior is nicely done and has actual aluminum trim vice the aluminum looking plastic you find in the competitors. Didn?t ever care for the color red, but the Black Cherry Metallic (which I purchased) is exceptional.</TEXT>

The cargo room is plenty for almost all your shopping needs. The Sirius radio is a pleasant surprise as we haven't played any CD's yet. The Wild Cherry color and 18" wheels make for a good looking car. Spend many hours researching the cars in this class and the Tiguan won even though it is more expensive.

Get many comments about it whenever we are out in it. Drives and rides very good plus the 2.0 gives good acceleration when merging on the highway. The roof was not on the wish list but is a nice feature. Spent hours researching all the other competitors models and felt this Tiguan stood out. So far only one gas fill up and was mainly city driving, gas mileage to be determined. The build quality seems to be very tight, the heated seats are very comfortable, it drives great and has excellent power. So far a great buy. </TEXT>

Fortunately, I drove a Tiguan when I was on a business trip in Europe, and wow! It had me after the first 2 miles of drive time. The interior has been thoughtfully put through finishing school. Elegant design, well-placed instrument clusters. The inside actually has more front/rear leg room and head room than our mid- sized Jeep Grand Cherokee.

However, nothing comes close to German style and especially the interior comfort and technology. My favorite feature is the sunroof which allows for a very nice view of the sky for both front and rear passengers. The gas mileage is respectable compared to the Mercury Mountaineer I traded in. The response to the accelerator is also respectable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The build quality on the Tiguan is amazing for a car in this price range. The car looks fantastic and handles exceptionally well with 4motion. The 2.0 Turbo is much quicker that I expected and the car is very quite on the highway. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The panoramic sunroof blows away the traditional sunroof. The stereo is very good, and all controls are logical. My car is sapphire blue with charcoal cloth seats. Overall, the interior is extremely of high quality. I also love the monster mats and the roof rack accessories. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After having it for five days and putting over 560miles on it, I can say that this automobile is fantastic. I took it home Thursday of last week (6/19/2008) and took it to Va Beach Saturday morning. Being that it is the first 500 miles, I didn't go over 65, and I was getting between 31.5 and 33 mpg!! That is amazing. There is the "recommended" premium octane fuel, but you can put regular. I will tell you that paying the extra 4-5 bucks (at the most) for prem per tank is well worth it. The drive is comfortable, even with four adults. The cabin is very quiet and the seat comfort is just fantastic. Plenty of room for both driver & passenger along with back passengers.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 200 Turbocharged horses (like another reviewer mentioned), the tight handling, the quietness, the interior, the warranty (free maintenance 10, 20, and 30K checkups), the auto up/down on all four windows, and the size.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drove just about every SUV in this class over a two month period and the Tiguan is by far the best. The Tiguan looks great inside and out and even without leather seats is very comfortable. The difference between this car and others like the Ford Escape or Toyota Rav4 is the way it handles. The drive is more like a car than an SUV. I thought the Honda CR-V was a very nice vehicle too but it was lacking any kind of pick up. Overall I am very happy to have purchased the Tiguan. Some dealers have said that they are not offering any deals for a number of reasons, but I was given a couple thousand off the sticker price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Moonroof is jaw-dropping. Speed is great. Seats are very comfortable. Cargo space is large enough and can be increased by moving the back seats forward. Perfect blend of SUV and a car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the most amazing value in the small SUV marketplace. The car is almost as fun to drive as our Mini ! The car sounds sporty, and looks like it racing along even parked at the curb. Drives like sporty car not an SUV. Gas mileage around town is 26 mpg and with gas price sky high we are very happy ! The quality and engineering are excellent as is to be expected from V.W. Lots of thoughtful features. But, driving is what's it all about, and the Tiguan is sure to put a smile on your face ! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, both inside and out. Comfortable and user friendly driver oriented control. Fun to drive. Engine exhaust sound, aka Triumph TR-6 note.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I looked at many vehicles from sedans to SUVs before deciding on the Tiguan to replace by Pilot (including the new Pilot). I decided sitting a little higher in traffic and all-wheel drive were important - hence my choice of another SUV. The Tiguan is fantastic -- quick acceleration, fun to drive and fuel economy of 28.5 mpg average on my first 2 tanks of regular gas. I choose the SEL for the added features and am not disappointed that I did. There is lots of room, and as a big guy I appreciate that. The back is tight for 3 adults, but would be fine for shorter distances - a luxury ride for 2 in the back. I am looking forward to better mpg, and am very satisfied with my Tiguan! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The panoramic sunroof is fantastic -- almost like a convertible. You can close the sunscreen so you can have the fresh air and not the hot sun if you want. I also like the Xenon headlights that light the path on corners and the automatic windshield wipers. Great turbo engine and response. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fast and Fun to drive. Tiguan handles like a sports car. Turbo charged acceleration is great.Tiptronic transmission is fun to play with. Fuel economy on the first tank for city driving was 23mpg,looking forward to a road trip soon. Lots of cargo room with rear seats folded down. Ride is very comfortable and quiet.visibility is excellent, much better than anything I have test driven. Easily fits in my garage and tight parking spaces. Performance, Styling, features and fuel economy are what won me over.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well worth waiting for. We were inches away from buying a different SUV (compact) So glad we waited. If you have ever driven a GTI, or Jetta with the 2.0T, this SUV is just that but you sit up higher, and it is AWD. Seats are very comfy and supportive. Lots of room in the rear sets. The icing on the cake is the panoramic moonroof WOW!!!! and has an extra electric screen that will cover the open moonroof. Also handles bumps in the road very.</TEXT>
