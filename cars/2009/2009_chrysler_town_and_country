<TEXT>This is a reliable and appealing car that I have had in my possession for over a year in which it has proven its worth. On the interior the features of the car such as the satellite radio make the long rides more enjoyable. The leather upholstery in the car gives it a comfortable feel and the layout in the car provides for communication between passengers without largely distracting the driver. Each of the two televisions mounted on the ceiling of the gray roof provide a distraction for kids, but I have found that they block the driver?s view in the rearview mirror. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sirius satellite radio and the sunroof. Also, the televisions provide a good environment for children. The exterior of the minivan is sleek, and functional, allowing for a trailer hitch and car top rack. Again, for long trips with much luggage the trailer hitch is a huge bonus and really makes the </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We replaced our 03 Limited with this 25th anniv Touring. Great price, great van. This has the 3.8, wish it has the 4.0. I gave this van 8 on performance & fun to drive, because... it's a van! I did not buy it for performance, or to take it on the back roads. Includes dual screen video, myGIG, tri-zone air, remote start, heated front & 2nd row seats, power pedals, 6 power windows, dual sliding doors controlled by a button or the handle, stow & go, rear view camera, and more!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stow & Go. Went from transporting the kids to renting a tiller in less than 5 minutes. Remote start, gets the AC or heat going fast. Rain sensing wipers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Chrysler T&C minivan is a great mode of transportation. Good visibility, easy to drive, nice sound system, comfortable seating, stow&go is awesome! With rebates, etc., this was my best choice. I've had Chrysler minivans in the past, and this is the best one yet. Mileage is a little weak, but expected to improve with age.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Satellite radio, stow & go seating, nice power under hood w/3.8 engine, lots of storage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Our vehicle is a Touring with the 4.0 Liter. With incentives this vehicle is substantially less expensive than the Honda and Toyota competition that we choose to compare with. A similar Honda was over $5K more. Note to Toyota - your stock tires supplied were horrible for winter driving. Do you not know where the vehicles are being delivered to - hello. Handling is a little sloppy but since we use it for highway not such a big deal. Don't try to use this vehicle in the mountains. On our first try, even though we used the shiftable auto transmission to slow the vehicle, the rotors warped after one trip. The 4.0 liter motor is an improvement from our previous T & C - decent power and mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The screen for the backup up cam is large which is nice. The Chrysler exclusive built hard drive which you can load up your favorite CD's is a favorite feature. This vehicle's stock tires are reasonably good for winter. The kids appreciate the rear seat DVD. Nicer interior styles than competition</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Trade in my 1996 Chev Blazer with over 230,000 miles. Thank you for the $$$ for clunkers. I'm very happy with this auto. My 1st time in a Mini Van. The kids love it. lots of room for other friends and family. Just the radio acts up time to time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I wrote this review as a rebuke to the "professional" reviews on this site. The touring model is a great value. The package I got has features that would costs many thousands more on a Honda or Toyota. Leather, cruise, 2 dvd's, hard drive music, satellite radio, 3 zone temp, auto side and rear door, power windows all around (including side and vent) 6 speed trans, auto start, backup camera, power driver and passenger heated seats, and a good warranty all for under $27K. I recently went on a highway trip and the gas mileage averaged 23 mpg. Sure its no Prius, but I moved 2 small accent tables, a large cooler, luggage, and still had comfortable seating for 3. Handling and ride is great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stow and go seats. Very convenient feature. This is hands down, the greatest feature of this mini-van. We used to have a minivan where you needed to remove the seats; a real pain. Hard drive music system. No need to hook up Ipod or carry CD's. Backup Camera. Living in Chicago its a must have.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Excellent for the $$$. Rides comfortable, kids love it b/c of 2 TV's. Like that kids can watch video & we can still listen to radio. Nice that you can load music onto hard drive so you don't have to keep inserting CD's. See no point in being able to load pictures as screen saver, wouldn't want family pics in car in case stolen, etc. Should've gotten higher pkg with both power seats b/c passengar seat can't be lowered and it's set a bit high for me. Easy to maneuver, V6 3.8 engine is a plus, pretty good "take off". Wish climate controls were digital instead of old fashion turn knobs. Stow N Go is excellent, gives us so much needed room. Overall, best bang for your buck. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had our van for one week now and just got back from a long road trip. After trading in a 2003 Dodge Grand Caravan we had an idea of what to expect from a new Chryler, but we were pleasantly surprised. The new van has vastly improved entertainment options and interior quality. My boys have had a lot of fun rotating the 2nd row seats to face backwards and challenge their brothers to video games on the third row video screen. Meanwhile I have enjoyed listening to Sirius sattelite radio in the front without having to listen to the sounds of race cars and explosions from the rear. We had 138000 miles on our last van. We were very happy about the unlimited powertrain warrany. Good!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We like the rotating 2nd row seats, three video screens, rear backup camera, power adjustable driver's seat, and side windows that roll down. Storage galore and a comfortable ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I sold my 2001 4WD4D Ram two weeks before taking delivery of my 2009 T & C. What a change. The first thing you notice is the ride and great gas mileage. I ordered the 4.0 with trailer-tow. Nice strong pull with no lag or stutter. Brakes are light with the right amount of feedback. This 25th Anniversary comes with 17 inch wheels and tires which is a great plus. The first trip to the East Coast was pleasant and had no issues. With 636 miles showing, i was getting 23.5 mpg. There is just something about a Ram Truck going the road! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The back-up camera is just outstanding. I never thought that I would use it, much less like it. Its great coming from a pickup truck. The blind spot for the mirrors are outstanding also.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drove Chrysler for 15 yrs. I love them, but in the 09 t&c the driver seat is too close to the front. It don't go back enough. when it goes back it also go down. then you can't see over the dashboard.The front part of the seat is always higher then your rear- you feel like your sitting in a bucket. If your under 5ft9in I think you will have problems with the driver's seat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just an update from my initial review back in April. The vehicle has perform wonderfully, we have had no issues with fit, trim, or initial build quality. Mileage has improved since it has been broken in, Highway 55-60 MPH around 25 mpg, Highway 65-70 mph around 23-24 mpg. City/Hwy around 18- 19 mpg. I read the reviews from car magazines of this minivan prior to buying you'd thought this vehicle to be a dog, not so, very comfortable, dependable, quite. Our last T&C got us 136,000 miles w/o any work other than routine maintenance. I expect the same here.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stow and Go has been much more convienient than we had first thought it would be. It has contributed to my wife's impulse buying of large items, since we can fold seats away quickly to make room for cargo</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second T&C. Obviously, I like them. My first one was purchased in 2000. My friends with Honda, Toyota, or Nissan, with equal minivan age, had to do one or more major repairs during the past 9 years. We never had any trouble with it and it has 100,000 miles. It was time to get a new one. After shopping around, we decided to stay with Chrysler. The 2009 touring is impressive in all aspects.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>too many options to list here - you can save thousands if you buy now. The ride is comfortable, the media center is impressive, and the acceleration is acceptable for such a heavy car. The six speed transmission saves gas on the HWY and it did close to 25 miles per gallon. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This auto satisfied everything we were looking for in every category. The comforts, the cargo ability, the gadgets, styling, price, and even its ability to maneuver in tight areas. It has truly made our life more streamlined and functional with having 2 children; not to mention the interior styling is as luxurious as it is functional. The exterior is more bold with strong modern lines. The previous models were way to soft for me, especially the front and rear fascias. There is nothing weak or meek with this much more handsome model. The interior was truly more luxurious than the Odyssey, Quest, Traverse, Acadia, F150, 1500 and a host of other SUV's, trucks & mini's we considered.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Touch screen audio and satellite radio. The 2 additional DVD players with wireless headphones for the kids allows us to listen to music simultaneously. Halo interior lighting and rear back up camera. The automatic doors & lift gate have a safety stop feature if they bump into anything while closing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drive the T&C for a hotel. It's rented longterm from Enterprise. It replaced a 2008 Dodge GC, essentially the same vehicle. Overall, pleasure to drive. Handles well, almost what you'd call 'sporty'. Well-appointed, tightly assembled, nicely functional. Comfortable, though passenger space is compromised in the Stow/Go version, a center bench would accomodate one more adult. The trans needs refinement/domestication. (See below.)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powered rear doors courteously accomodate passengers. But they get confused if the passenger and the driver activate the door shortly apart. And the previous (Dodge) needed work on the doors after 1 year, the R one refused to close.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just recently traded my 2002 T&C for a new '09 Touring edition. I first test drove a used Mercedes E-class because we already own a Mercedes SUV which my husband loves and of course was pleased with the ride but when I asked the question whether our six member family was ready to have my husband's SUV be the largest vehicle in our household, answer came back a resounding NO. Because have had such great experience with two previous T&C's (trade-in had 130,000+ miles) decided to check out new T&C and dealer incentives. By the time all the incentives were added (including $3,500 for trade-in) my $37,000 minivan went down to $28,000 and well...the rest is history in the making!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned our minivan a year and a half and the check engine light has been on since 48hrs after we bought it. We have been to 3 different dealerships and nobody can fit it. My car juts forward and engine revs into the red as I am driving at least once a week. I have been told it is a new model and they are working on the kinks. I was also told it has a life time warranty, so why should I worry. I told them if my car blows up on the highway a warranty is not going to save my life or the car behind me hitting me when I jut. I can't wait for my lease to be up in another year and a half so they can have this lemon back. I will never buy a MiniVan again and never any Chrysler again!!</TEXT>

Bought the extended warranty after reading Edmounds review. 16 inch wheels is easier for getting in and out of van.

<TEXT>Our family has just accepted our new van and we love it. The kids love the fact that their windows now go down and that they can listen to "Kids Stuff" from Sirius satellite radio and watch a DVD at the same time. In fact we can listen to three unique audio / visual sources simultaneously. For any parent who has had to listen to Dora while driving you know how important that is. We are leaving this week for a 1000 mile drive to Gulf Shores. I expect this to be an enjoyable drive with our new Inferno Red Town & Country.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We thought after our last minivan we would not buy another, but after test driving of '09 Accord sedan we concluded that they are too low, with no ride/comfort advantage over the T&C. The crossover vehicles, although more stylish, do not offer the verstility of a minivan, and get worse gas mileage with harsher ride. The Touring trim level was just right for us, we have no need for DVD player(s), leather, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the Town and Counrty for a little over a week. I have to say that I really enjoy driving it. The seats are really comfy and my daughter loves the DVD player. My husband seems to really like the satelite radio that comes free for a year, and we all love the rear view back up camera. The radio is very fancy with the ability to store songs on the internal hard drive. My screen saver is a picture of the family in Disney world. The doors are easy to open and close and the radio is easily viewed while driving and easy to navigate. I know I have not had the car for too long, but our experience so far has been nothing but positive. The car is quiet, love the stow and go seats!</TEXT>
