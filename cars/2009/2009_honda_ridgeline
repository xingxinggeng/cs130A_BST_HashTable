<TEXT>Traded my 2006 Ridgeline RT for the 2009 RTL. This truck was so practical and reliable in the past 3.5 years I decided to do it all over again...this time with the leather, Navigation, XM radio and sunroof. The 2006 I traded in with 60K miles drove as good as the day I drove it home new. The 2009 feels a bit tighter and quieter but considering the 2006 was its 1st year production, Honda just kept improving it and it shows!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Full size trunk in bed and bulletproof reliability. RTL is Honda's answer to the Escalade pickup!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Since 1985 I've owned an F-150 and four Silverados. By far the Honda is better built and more versatile. I don't need to tow my house or haul cattle. I park it instead of docking it. It is agile, and rides as well as my wife's Acura. We drove it to Colorado from Houston with another couple and the ladies' only complaint about the back seat was the height of the seatbelt anchors.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering feel, transmission smoothness and responsiveness. Five foot bed is plenty big.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just completed a 3500 mile road trip with the wife and all the luggage that brings. Drove well on freeways and secondary roads, also did did well in the southwestern sun and downpours back east. Mileage was 19.4 for the trip and though it runs well at eighty the gas mileage really takes a hit. It is a tight vehicle with no rattles, vibrations or sqeaks. My general use other than road trips is around town and to the hardware store. Honda did well as this is one great truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The well laid out interior and center armrest/storage area was great for the little items. Rear seat bottoms that fold up were nice and we used that area for a cooler, jackets etc.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The truck is great. I'm not trying to bad mouth anyone, but I'm not too sure as to what another writer was stating in reference to the looks of the 09 versus to earlier models. The only changes are cosmetics, i.e. new grill, colors, and other minor changes. The truck is awesome. It has the same payload as the small F-150. Again not to knock Ford, but I don't need a truck that size. The Honda carries my sportbike. You will need a trailer or a bigger truck such as a Ford or Chevy to to carry a bigger bike due to the length not the weight. I live in a townhouse not on a ranch, and the Ridgline does everything I need. The truck drivers like a large Accord.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Trunk, XM, & Heated Seats. I live in the North East.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been a SUV owner for the last 12 years, wanted a truck but never wanted to give up the space of an SUV. This has been the perfect cross over to a truck. Fun to drive, solid vehicle. Would highly recommend. I get 17 MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First and foremost let me reiterate that I'm a real life Ridgeline owner. I came from a Ford F-150 and contrary to what others say, I have no reliability problems ever. I downgraded to a smaller house with a small garage and the Ford's size was just too much and it was an old workhorse. Enter the Ridgeline, and all I can say wow and wow, if this truck had a more peppy engine, it would be the BMW of pickups due to its almost telepathic handling. Truck is small on the outside, but humongous on the inside. The old Ridgeline was ugly and dorky, the new one is more visually appealing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Clever packaging inside, looks and feels big inside while diminutive on the outside. Is one heck of a looker when accessories are added. In bed trunk is brilliant. 19 mpg average, worst was 15 mpg, best was 22 mpg. Fits three car seats if needed, or two car seats and one adult. Smooth high speed handling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Third Ridgeline to date. Very reliable, dependable. Complaints: Add more seat travel or legroom for the driver! I am 5'10", another 2 - 3 inches of seat travel would make a WORLD of difference in comfort on long drives. I seldom have any passengers in the rear seat, for the one or two times yearly this occurs, I could move the driver seat up a bit. And speed up the wipers on the "high" setting. Otherwise, very comfortable truck. Adequate power on highways, full time four wheel drive great in snow/ice conditions. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power rear sliding window. Finally, a rear sliding window that is convenient! Auto down and UP for the driver window! In bed truck, two way tailgate. Heated wiper area. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is an excellent truck for the money. Base level model has all the features you'd want. It drives like a large car with a comfortable ride yet has the utility of a truck. Truck capabilities more than adequate for light duty work (towing a boat, hauling yard stuff or pulling a smaller RV) yet space and driving manners perfect for a family. This is about as close as one can get to the perfect vehicle that does everything for everyone. I have only had it for about a week and put on about 500 miles yet I am delighted with it. I have owned F150s which are also excellent trucks but this is by far a better value for someone in need of a "pleasure truck" (F150 much better heavy duty work truck).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Carlike road manners and ride, great storage under the bed, long list of standard features, great gas mileage (for a truck), Honda quality - fit and finish excellent. This is also a very sharp looking truck that is extremely quiet and refined.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Owned 5 fords & 1 chevy and finally decided to get out of the big truck mode. This was a huge decision and I am extremely please to say the right decision. What a great design, fun to drive and a pleasure to own. All this and I get to keep the extra dollars saved on gas. This is a solid built truck and does the job. Hard to believe the big three couldn't figure out how to put the trunk feature in the full size trucks or design seats that actually fold up and give real cargo space. Oh did I mention no rattles either. Don't but a truck without test driving the Ridgeline. Get over your manly belief that only a full size truck will do. You will be surprised & a lot happier you did. I did & I am!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Obviously the locking trunk is an innovative & great option & can hold two sets of golf clubs. Double hinged tailgate a bonus. Well laid out interior not too fancy but nicely done with great storage. Leather interior is nice. Real comfortable & quiet on the highway. Not having to bail out Honda!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned my ridgeline for a week now. LOVE IT. I was looking at buying a Toyota fj cruiser. On the ridgeline the back windows go down. Though I cannot climb a mountain, The ridgeline gave me the comfort I was looking for with a lot of features I would not have with the fj cruiser. Same towing capacity the same mileage, with a lot more comfort and class.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bed trunk, great pickup, rear window, fold down or swing out tail gate, Flip up back seat. 4 cargo lights.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I looked at the Tacoma, but didn't like the pricing (had to add a whole package just to get keyless entry, another package to get tow wiring, etc). The Ridgeline has it all, standard. I really like the trunk and the way the rear seats flip up for storage. There are many small intelligent things: the heater doesn't blow cold air on you (it waits until the car has warmed up before blowing any air), the driver's window has auto-down AND auto-up, you can lower all four windows with the key fob (great for airing out hot air), and the car gives you your real-time mpg as you drive. It's fun, well-designed, and with Honda reliability too.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>SE MN Ridgeline RTL</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Aquired the 09 Ridgeline RTL to replace 02 Dodge Dakota Quad 4x4 with 110K. I really like the Ridgeline and enjoy driving it each day. Solid build, minimal windnoise, even on windy days. Love the trunk! The seating and build is is better than the Dakota. Added an A.R.E. Z-series Cap for ~$2000, fit is okay, but these are not meant to be easily taken off and put back on like most fiberglass caps/toppers. Need to consider if you hall large objects now and then.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Solid build/quiet MPG 19 average- if you drive sensibly! MPG Hwy trips 22-23 on 300 mile trip:) MPG comment: Not a vehicle for lead- foots (floor this a lot- forget it :( Great Stereo Interior space Trunk and bed lights</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great truck. Just be smart about what you are buying. I am really happy with my Ridge. I wanted a truck that was reliable, comfortable, and had longevity designed in - not planned obsolescence. It is not a big Ford or Chevy - it is a medium sized truck more suitable for a person who values convenience, storage, and intelligence over outright brawn. I couldn't be happier as this vehicle fulfills all my needs for a truck - adequate towing, people mover, great ride, good at the lumber yard/garden center - in a 4 wheel drive long lasting Honda package. For most of us that want a truck, don't tow more than 5000 lbs, and don't live on a farm, this truck was designed with us in mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I would ignore the previous "hondahater" negative review; obviously he made a wrong decision to lease this vehicle. If this is the type of vehicle you are looking for (read; not huge trailer towing, 4x4ing,) then it is the right decision. I was looking at a Tacoma to replace my 15 year old Dakota, this Ridgeline is the ticket for me. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A trunk in a truck; why didn't anybody think of this before? Sportscar like handling</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had for a little over a month. It is excellent and more people should consider it. I compared Tundra, Tacoma, F-150 and Chevy. Overall, best value by far! The trunk is awesome, ride is car like, it has more than sufficient off road (4x4) capability 99% of us. Towing ability is respectable. Interior features are a great blend of luxury, quirky, and utility truck. It is so easy and pleasant to drive this truck. After 5 years of a Tacoma and a lousy Chevy 2500, I have finally stepped up into a truck built just for me. Gas mileage is okay- average about 18.5. I can get over 21 on highway. V-6 has plenty of power/torque. A great truck, high quality and I even like the looks.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>In bed trunk, composite bed, ride, handling, design, build quality, no rattles, no leaks, built in Canada and Honda ISN'T USING MY TAX DOLLARS FOR A BAILOUT that I sure as heck don't get.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my Ridgeline now for over 3 months. I can't imagine a truck fitting my needs better. I love the looks, not just another pick-up. The in bed lock-able compartment is an answer to so many problems for pick-up owners Fun to drive, good mileage (19.5) mostly highway. I wish I knew what they were thinking when they put in that center glove box. ODD! Over all, I'd do it again in a second.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Why I purchased this car I will never know. Look Honda has great compact, coupes and sedans.....but trucks???? They should leave it up to others. MPG is 10 at best. Interior is all plastic, cheap looking and rattles. Sun roof seal leaks in water if only glass is closed. Can't wait to get rid of this piece of junk. Only good thing is the stereo system w/ nav. Only 20 more months to go on lease. Then I'm running for a Tundra (real truck). </TEXT>

<TEXT>I sold my 2006 Ridgeline RTL. Prior to purchasing the 09 Ridgeline I drove each competitors vehicle, and decided to purchase a 2009 Ridgeline RTL w/navigation. In the end, I couldn't part with the in-bed trunk, ride quality, general utility, and balance between car and truck offered by the Ridgeline. The Ridgeline's price was also less than comparably equipped 4x4 vehicles from other mfgs. The Ridgeline's 4x4 capability is more limited, but it satisfies my needs. So far, I love the truck (700 miles) and the gas mileage has been a respectable 18 mpg with most driving around town. My truck is Billet Silver, w/chrome step bars, silver roof rack, bug deflector, splash guards, and wheel locks.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride quality, room, and overall balance between truck and SUV.</FAVORITE>
