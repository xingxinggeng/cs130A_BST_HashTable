<TEXT>Bought this car 3 weeks ago and have put 1700 miles on it. I've been getting 26-27 mpg combined city/hwy mileage. The base V-6 is quiet & delivers spirited acceleration in town and when passing on the highway. The 6-speaker stereo sounds good; I really like the XM satellite radio, and the USB as I can put all my music on a tiny jump drive and don't have to clutter the car with CD's. Interior is comfortable, well- appointed, and build quality is as good as Honda, Toyota, etc. Handling & ride quality are excellent, & the stock tires seem to work well in all conditions.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth engine, quiet interior, nice stereo, lots of interior storage, lots of safety features, excellent build quality.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great looking SUV and runs, drives and handles even better. Ride is a little firm on rough roads, but excellent on a good highway. The 3.3 V6 performs much better than the 2.7 with the same highway MPG rating. We LOVE the great looking beige premium cloth interior as well as the other upgrades that come with the SE package. The Limited package is nice, but we just don't like leather seats and one summer in Alabama will enlighten you as to why!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I chose the Santa Fe for many reasons vs. the competition. The over-all value we felt we received with this vehicle meets our expectations. The 3rd row seating with the DVD player entertainment system is a BIG plus! The vehicle handles well, and has decent pick-up. I am slightly disappointed with the 1st of 5 gears; It feels like it hesitates a little from a stand-still. The "Range" feature of the trip computer is misleading- When I think I am about to run out of gas, and when I fill-up, I only put in 16.8 gal, not the 19.8 it holds! Overall, the vehicle is very quiet, has a great Infinity sound system, fun blue dash lighting (and cup holder), and user-friendly controls.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>8-way adjustable driver seat, dual-zone climate control, 2nd row B-Pillar vents, 3rd row auxiliary climate control, style, quietness, 1st and 2nd row leg room, 115v power outlet (at rear of vehicle).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> Purchased the 2.7 with 5 speed manual. This power train combination is very disappointing and should be avoided. Recommended shift points are at 15 mph. 25 mph. 35 mph. and 45mph (each of these coincide with very close to 3,000 rpm). Slower-than- expected acceleration from a stop is unnerving, with over-anxious drivers behind you. After 1200 mile break-in (not traveling above 55 mph)the drivetrain mismatch becomes evident, as you can only reach and maintain 65 mph by sustaining 3,000 rpm or higher in 5th gear! Slight hills challenge you to maintain speed, even with no load. I believe this car fails to meet the minimum performance requirements for safe driving on U.S. interstate highways. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cabin very roomy. Fit and finish very good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>One month in - No gripes. Reviews about lag in trans depend on how you drive. Easy driving - no lag, Hard accel - initial lag at downshift with quick recovery. Firm ride but smooth. Good features for $$. Concern about warranty - saw something about only good at dealership where purchased, but haven't confirmed. Compared to Toyota, Honda, Kia, Nissan before purchase and felt Hyundai was "best value". Dealer wasn't eager to lower price due to demand caused by $4clunkers, but still managed to get below TMV price. So far - so good. Features are nice & easy to use. Good layout. Seat slightly firm, but OK on first 300 mile road trip. Seems to be good value for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good driver position/visibility. Rear corners - roof support posts not too wide - don't block view too much. Manual (high reliability) seat adjustment - tilt/height/lumbar and steering tilt adjustment. Rear under deck storage. Good drink holder & placement. 3.3L will jump if you need it. Love the XM.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We really like our Santa Fe. It's our "family car" in Colorado. It seemed to be bigger than the CRX or RAV but smaller than the Explorer and comparable models. Nice size then, not too big, not too small. Gas mileage not too bad at 19.5 overall, mostly in the city, in Colorado. AWD drives like a tank in the snow on original tires. Won't be changing to snow tires in the winter anymore, yippee. Very quiet, smooth ride. Not really a sporty ride, but works well for me, I was hoping for a smoother, cruiser feel in the family car. Great price for a pretty good looking car that's already got crumbs, shoe marks and general family use. We are very happy with the purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet, smooth ride, great in the snow, love the stereo, great AC, great price of course, nice size, not a monster but big enough to (barely) load in drywall, I think it looks decent, certainly respectable. The V6 is smooth and powerful, warranty includes 5 yr 60000 full coverage, insurance is cheap </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We all remember the early Hyundais of the late '80s... total junk. I am admittedly impressed with the design, ride, noise level, performance and quality so far of my new 2009 Santa Fe AWD Limited. I would definitely recommend pitting at least 2 dealerships against each other's quotes to price match (or beat) as I did. Doing this, I got the limited model for slightly less than the SE retail price after rebates and the "Cash for Clunkers" deal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride is firm, yet quiet and smooth, good power, form fit and function.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Shopped hard, drove the 2010 Equinox and Rav-4, wanted to buy American but the Santa Fe won out with the overall value. The best warranty -- $4500 Cash For Clunkers -- $2000 Cash Back -- Under Invoice Pricing from USAA. Priced it against same vehicle previously owned at auction = about the same price. Great ride, fit and finish, quiet, sacrifice a little on the gas mileage and electronics do dads but overall this is a great vehicle. I am going to try the synethetic oil and K&N filter suggested by another review to see if we can get the same 26 MPG. Dealer experience was excellent, helpful with no pressure or gotchas at the end. Looks and feels like a Lexus! </TEXT>

<TEXT>OK, needless to say this is a great car. I purchased a 2007 SF Limited, my daughter liked it so well, I sold it to her then purchased a 2008 SF limited for myself. I really prefer the 2007 over my 2008 mainly because of the limited color choices, the '07 had gray leather interior, I detest black leather interior but the only choice other than the ugly beige. I like everything about the car other than that, it's great. Yea I would probably trade for a 2009 if I could get the color scheme I wanted but once again, nothing but black so will not be trading again til the choices are better. OK, it's a woman thing</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was raised on Ford and Chevy. Naturally I was skeptical when looking at a Hyundai, but I'm pleasantly surprised so far. We just bought it two days ago and so far I'm happy. The price is awesome compared to other brands. It rode just like the Highlander we test drove before-hand. Plus it looks like a Lexus. WE looked at Ford Flex, Toytota Highlander, GMC Acadia, and the Mazda CX-9. This beat them all. I like the iPod interface and the blue interior lighting. All in all, I'm happy with vehicle and hope it will last us a while and possibly become our daughter's first car. These cars have come a long way from their days of disposable vehicles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Blue dash lighting, iPod interface, 242hp, third row, interior/exterior styling, Homelink, auto-dim mirror, power seat, easy to up grade to after market audio/video unlike Toyota or Honda...if necessary ;) and most importantly PRICE!! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Did the Cash For Clunkers program; $27945 sticker, $3500 CFC, $2000 Hyundai rebate, $1100 additional dealer discount = $21345 total paid plus fees. First day driving it, my friend sees it and says "Dude, you got a Lexus?" True story. I love the way it drives. Good visibility from the drivers seat. AC works great. Smooth acceleration and shifting. More than ample cargo space. Have never had a vehicle with this many great features including AM/FM/XM/CD radio w/steering wheel mounted controls, powered drivers seat, powered moonroof, and Bluetooth equipped. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this for my wife after looking at and driving many others. We looked at Mitsubishi Outlander and Subaru Forester. Both did not come close to the drive, features, and fit/finish the Hyundai had. We love the features on the Limited model and didn't need the nav or dvd packages. You might find other makes that have similar features but will probably be a lot higher in price. Awesome vehicle for the price!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 6 months of research on SUV's, I chose the Santa Fe for it's style, performance, price, warranty program, leg and head room (I'm 6'-4"). No sunroof addition which allows 5 extra inches of head space. The AWD is very responsive and the 3.3L, 6cyl is well worth the upgrade.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The privacy window tint is not too dark and is beneficial for warmer days. The MP3 CD player and the iPod connection is a real plus. Plenty of hidden cargo space.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased a new Hyundai in July due to the Cash for Clunkers program. I had a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee, that I have loved, but it was getting ready to hit 200K. I drove several different models from the Kia Sportage, to the Toyota RAV4, Chevrolet Equinox, and the Santa Fe. On my second fillup I got 24 mpg-unbelievable!The inside is well designed except for the seats are not comfortable; driver's side. They are very stiff and not nearly as comfortable as the Jeep or other American cars. Please include fog lights as standard on this vehicle. The paint job is beautiful and I am thrilled about the warranty! Love the sound system and I usually put custom sound systems in the car after purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the XM radio and IPod, the Ipod connection is what sold me on the Santa Fe. Love the lighting on the dials, so easy to see in dusk/dawn conditions. Engine is so quiet and do love the 'shiftronic' from 1st gear to 4th to give you that manual transmission feel. love the lighter interior options.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the truck so that my 82 year- old cancer-patient Mother could get in and out with ease. I like the truck okay, but I take issue with Hyundai's Mobility Program, or rather, the lack thereof. All of the add-ons I needed to assist my Mother were considered "accessories" and Hyundai refuses to pay for them. I wasn't asking for anything extraordinary; a trailer hitch so I can use my wheelchair lift and running boards to steady her while she gets in. Neither one is covered. Smoke and Mirrors and absolutely no substance. Shame on Hyundai.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife fell in love with the Santa Fe a year ago.She never showed much interest in the many cards that we owned including Cadillacs and a Lexus (es 330 2004) The Santa Fe is as quiet as the Lexus. We love everything about the car. It is comfortable and extremely well made. I added molding to the side which added to the look. We had spoken to many Santa Fe owners and everyone said they love it. No one had any negative comments</TEXT>

<TEXT>Did a lot of research on-line through CR and Edmunds. We have three kids and wanted something sporty with a third row seat. We also did not want a mega SUV with poor gas mileage. In doing the research, the choice was obvious. The Santa Fe has excellent ratings and the price is thousands less than comparable vehicles. We now had the car for one week and we love it. The third row has plenty of room and can split, to maintain storage. The engine is quiet and the ride is smooth. The car has a nice high view of the road. We use to have a station wagon, and we thought we might be losing some cargo space. This was not the case. There is plenty of cargo space and the car is not overly long.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Kids love the DVD player. I like the feeling of being high up. The rear door opens very easily and the third row seat has adequate space for a midsize SUV.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well, replaced my 2001 Ford explorer Sport and this thing rocks. It has so many features it's ridiculous. A ton room and storage areas, extra 12vdc plugs in various locations, the stereo is great once the equalizer is tuned up, the USB port works great with a normal usb cable. It's quiet, fast and the ride is very smooth with the 3.3 L. The blue lights are just like my VW dash, nice. The interior is really upscale, very comfortable. The back seats have plenty of room and the recline with a nice little arm rest back there too. Rear cargo space is more than my Ford and the under mat storage in great to have. Sharp body design. You can't get a SUV for this $ with all these features.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We replaced my wife's 2002 Mazda Tribute with this after a great deal of research. Love the quality and build. Very comfortable; rides like a car not a truck. The Premium sound system in the Limited is among the best I've ever heard (and I drive Lexus) Satellite Radio is nice extra that's standard. What sold us, too, was the outstanding warranty. V6 engine is quite sufficient for this vehicle and auto trans is smooth. Overall, very pleased with this purchase and the $2000 incentive from Hyundai made the purchase of this cost about as much as the Tribute did 7 years ago! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this Santa Fe new in March of 2009. I have had it for 3 months. The ride is smooth, the interior is well laid out, seats are comfortable. The only complaint I have is the acceleration from a stop is slow, seems like it drags, between first and second gear. Also, I have a rattle in the passenger rear and the dealer can't locate it, makes me a little crazy. I am getting on average 20.5 mpg. If you want a Nice suv for a good price check this one out.</TEXT>
