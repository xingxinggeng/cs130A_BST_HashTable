<TEXT>Have owned a number of Mazdas over the yrs, all good except the American built 1999 626 - it was junk. Mazda 3 is recommended by me and i do lots of driving. problems ... rear view mirror set too low from dealership, almost wrote off car on third day due to blind spot ... hesitates on a damp mornings going up hills. dealership said knew nothing about it, until i gave them a list of 4 other mazda owners with same problem, and they admitted they all do it. I can live with it, but am careful to put in decent brand name gas, that helps. .... seats are a bit worn after 18 months and underside of glove box all scratched otherwise, its fantastic, too bad they changed the body style this yr </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>fav features, decent stereo system, good gas mileage, people always comment that it looks great. fits the family, and i look good driving by myself. no blind spots and fun to drive. looks like its worth more than it it. really good car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got the '09 M3i, 2.0 manual. I deliver pizza and do a lot of driving. I've driven nice cars; a porche, some bmw's and a few other nice cars so I'm trying to be completely objective with my review and will break down my scoring on the scale above. Performance: zippy, but not real fast, can't hang with the big boys but the handling is superb, which brought the score up to a 7/10. Comfort: I drive for HOURS! I'm never uncomfortable. 7/10. Fuel economy: I avg 27 mpg...depending on the use of AC and if i'm driving like a maniac which i sometimes do. 350-290 miles per tank.(usually around 320). 7/10. Fun to drive: that the handling is so surprisingly responsive combined </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>with decent acceleration and power the whole seems greater than the sum of it's parts and is a joy to drive. 8/10. Interior design: handsome, well put together and steering wheel cd/radio controls make it feel better than what you payed for it. needs more though. 7/10. Exterior design</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first car, and as such I am simply glad to have one, but I have fallen in love with pretty much every aspect of the car. It has very good handling and a fairly peppy engine, although it is not a Corvette by any means. The aesthetics are very high quality and good looking both inside and out. Mine came with a 4 speaker audio system, but for a 4 speaker, the sound output is very high quality with rumbling bass and clear trebles. The only gripe I have is that power windows/door locks are only available in higher trim levels costing almost $3000 more. I have also had to replace the gas cap, but apparently this has been redesigned and will not get stuck as my old one did.</TEXT>

<TEXT>All of the features have been covered in other reviews but have two complaints. 1. Someone else mentioned the dirt/rocks issue....for some reason, on this vehicle, the rocks and dirt you pick up from the road rolls around in the wheel wells and is very audible..more so then any other vehicle I have had, even a Toyota Pick UP..so that can be somewhat annoying..I purposely avoid sandy parts of the road cuz I don't want to hear the rocks rattling around for the next 10 seconds.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a 95 Mazda Protege for 13 years before getting my Mazda 3. I am really enjoying this new car. Looks nice and I receive many compliments on it. Rides wonderful and handles wonderful....sporty feel. My hubby remarked how comfortable the front passenger seat is, and he's a big guy. Love the stereo system. Only thing it needs improvement on is gas mileage. Could also use a little more room in back seat. Don't know what the reliability will turn out to be, but gave it a high score based on my 95 Protege. Test drove 5 cars in its class, and this one, by far, was the best. Some felt junky, cheap interiors, handled lousy, or too expensive. This one is best value for the money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned previous vehicle(Oldsmobile)7 years, owned this vehicle only 6 months. Purchased because we were very happy with our 2003 Mazda Protege. Interior quality lacking relative to Protege. Plastic scuffs easily and rear seat fabric fraying after only 2,000 miles and 3 months. Fuel tank holds 14.5 gallons. Reads 3/4 full after 2 gallons used and 1/2 full after 5 gallons used. Road noise evident. Extremely small trunk relative to competition and other Mazda. As a conservative driver highway mpg is great at 35 mpg, but local mpg at times in low 20's. Audio system subpar relative to other Mazda. A/C does not blow very cold compared to older Mazda. Dealer service was terrible on issues.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased a Mazda 3 5 Door Sport after leasing a Honda Accord for the past three years. This car is GREAT! I had a couple friends recommend it and after the test drive I knew it was the car for me. It's got great styling, good fuel economy, and is fun to drive. The Sport version is loaded with a ton of standard features that were upgrades on other cars I looked at. The 2.3L engine has plenty of power both off the line as well as to get up and go on the highway. I went for the automatic (for my wife) but the manual shift option performs very similar to a manual transmission, giving you a little more control. All-in-all I am fully satisfied and would recommend this car!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car overall. Have both a 06 mazda 6 and this 09 mazda 3. although the interior is a bit inferior of that of the 6, the 3 is very well built and has seamless lines. The 2.0 litre is very peppy and I imagine the 2.3 would only be better, as my 6 has a 2.3. This 3 has very tight steering and has been successful to living up to mazdas' zoom zoom motto. Excellent exterior as well, much better at turning heads than a civic and corolla in my opinion. Mileage is decent, although the civic may get a few more miles/ gallon (possibly 5 or so). Overall a great car for people who like to drive. Definitely recommended!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Test drove the Civic before deciding on the mazda 3. It is faster, more fun, better build quality, and does not feel like you are driving a spaceship. If you want to be bored of your car, buy a corolla. Civic is still a good well built car but nowhere near as much fun as they used to be. The engine is very strong for its class and is just a great example of how good Mazda is.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have this car for about a month. So far, wife and I are very pleased with the seat comfort,interior materials and design. I also like the quick pick up from a red light that makes it seem as if there's a much larger engine than the 2.0 L 148 HP standard mill. Very nimble cornering and turning... I avoided a stuck car in the middle lane of a major highway with it's quick steering response, but steering is too sensitive at 60 mph + and requires constant minor corrections to stay in lane. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Dashboard, cruise and radio controls on the steering wheel, Huge locking glove compartment, firm bolstered seats, effective windshield washer, excellent headlights illuminate the entire road and the foglights make the lighting even better. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I found the Madda 3i touring Value Sedan had the best overall interior quality look and feel, and the standard equipment package included everything I wanted. Driving it over the past few weeks confirmed that I made the right choice. The seats are very comfortable, the car is nimble, very maneuverable and a pleasure to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove this Mazda3 and a 09 Corolla S. I was very disappointed with the Corolla. For about $900 more i got a great handling fun to drive hatchback with a 2.3L engine,5 speed auto w/manual mode,4 wheel disc brakes,DSC, and 17" wheels,crystal pearl white paint to name a few. This car pulls strong through out the whole rev band, and handles like a go cart. I am very satisfied with my purchase so far. Just wish it had a little more cargo room. Kinda tight fit for my golf clubs.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After my previous kicked the bucket I was in the market for a new car. I test drove a couple of other vehicles but after getting in the 3, I knew it was the vehicle for me. I did quite a lot of research on every possible vehicle and was originally planned on a economy car. However, the price, performance, and quality was exactly what I wanted. The Mazda 3 is a great car, and does exactly what you would like it to. It loves to be driven, it looks beautiful and stands out (without being ostentatious), and is a dream for someone who prefers smaller sized fun driving cars. Sure you could buy a better mpg, economy car. But for the price you will NOT find a more fun to drive vehicle for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Pricing, 17 inch alloy rims, interior quality/aesthetics bar none, auto dimming mirror with compass, fold down rear seats, telescopic wheel, lumbar supporting seats, Fog Lights, Mazda racing heritage. The fact that even after a long day of work this car thrills you on the ride home, NEVER boring.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It seems to be a great little car. I purchased it because its a bargain. I won't mention what I paid for it, but I will say it was more than $2,000 less than the corolla, and the cobalt. Interior and exterior are better looking than the aforementioned vehicles. The gas mileage could be better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a 50 year old driver and have owned several cars for 12+ years so I was looking for a practical & reliable car. Boring right? Well, the Mazda 3i is all about practical & reliable...but the cool factor is off the chart too. I compared sevaral cars in the class for the following features: independent suspension & abs disk brakes on all 4 wheels, twin cam 4 cylinder, alloys, 4 doors, timing chain (not belt), cruise, curtain airbags, nice sounding sound system. I got all this and lots more at a much better price than I thought possible with the 3i value package. The 3 is assembled in japan which, in my experience, means very high quality. This car rocks.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>incredibly fun to drive. A 5 speed stick is the perfect for this car! the styling still looks great and turns heads even though it's been around for a few years. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I decided to write a PartIII to my reviews. PartI compares Maz3 to 2 major competitors. PartII adds more details on Maz3. PartIII will add more comments and answer two critical questions for buyers/owners. Handling is the selling point of Maz3. But on center feel is not as good as German cars. Above 70mph, you better hold onto the steeling wheel tight. The P205/50VR17 stock tires provides adequate grip. But wider tires with directional patterns will sure improve traction more. Understeer is presented in high speed. DSC is not available unless you have the touring model. Zig-zag shifter needs get used to for straight shifter users. Trunk design can be simplified to yield more usable space.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Why choose Maz3 instead of Mazspeed3? Maz3 is for everyday use. Speed3 uses the same 2.3L engine supercharged to 100hp+ more. Can't run too cold or hot. Reliability could suffer. Lower ground clearance and summer tires are no good for some weather / road condition. Speed3 price tag is $4000+ more.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>More comments here of Mazda3 for buyers/owners to note. Again this is a great car, simply the best in class. Few improvements here but all are minor. Exterior styling is great. Head lights should be pointed slightly higher. On downhills, the lights fall a bit short. The red tail lights are a bit dim and small. Should be brighter for safety reason. Though the bumper reflective tapes help a bit. For s model, you get black plastic in real bumper. But it's more scratch resistant, good when loading cargo. Real bumper does flex a bit.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior is beautiful. It is the most comfortable seating and natural feel in cars I've driven. Visibility is great. A pillar obstruction is minor. C pillar window helps blind spot. Orange instrument illumination is OK. The blue rings beautify more. Found minor offs in fit/finish for control stalks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove a 2009 Corolla and Honda Civic and this Mazda 3 offered more of what I wanted than either of those cars. The gauges are easy to read, the buttons make sense on the dashboard. The Honda Civic has a tachometer as big as a pie plate behind the steering wheel taking up a sizable portion of the dash. Maybe that is great if you are a 16 year old boy, but as a middle aged female I didn't like it and I thought it was a stupid design placement. The Mazda, on the other hand, is user friendly in terms of the interior and had more personality on the exterior than Corolla or Civic. I got a great (GREAT!) deal on my car and I may be a Mazda fan for life now.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>easy to use dashboard features, some standard features that I would have paid for as options in other vehicles like music control buttons on the steering wheel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>There is no better looking car in this class, or more fun. The engine, even at 2.0, is peppy, fast and ready to go. I love how sporty it is, both outside and inside. Lots of headroom for a car this size. Feels and handles like a BMW 3 series, but you are paying $10-$15K cheaper! Its sporty and fast enough and yet, it still gets good gas mileage. Between city and highway, I averaged 29- 31/gal. and the stereo which comes with the i touring sounds really good, nice acoustic and full bass. I am 6'1 and I bump my head when getting into a BMW 3 series, but no problem at all with the Mazda 3. Its tight, its firm, and feel you are in control all the time. Its just an awesome car all around!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Manual transmission shifts like butter. Handles well on curves and very fun to drive. Love the red and blue illumination lights. LED tail lights Great sounding stereo which plays MP3s also Excellent gas mileage for a sporty sedan Remote audio control Excellent brake action and side airbags </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My last car was a VW Golf. It served me well for 10+ years. It was a fun-to-drive machine, but quite costly to maintain, especially with age. So I decided it's time for a new car. I test drove 3 hot hatches: new Toyota Matrix (158hp/4cyl); VW Rabbit (170hp/5cyl); Mazda3 5dr (156hp/4cyl). Here's my little comparo. 3rd place, Matrix. Highs: big cargo room, Toyota reliability. Lows: Mazda3 copy cat, dull handling, peculiar styling, high price (23k for XRS), poor corner visibility due to large A pillar. 2nd place, VW Rabbit. Highs: big engine, VW fun, quality interior. Lows: uncomfortable seat (angled too much), confusing controls, strange "wall" under windshield, questionable reliability.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1st place, Mazda3 5dr. The winner of my admiration and cash. :) Highs: the most comfortable seat and driving position here, excellent handling, quality interior, clean exterior styling, most features for the price. Lows: smallest engine here, smallest cargo space here, a bit more tires / road noise.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Previous to this, I had a Mazda Protege5 and that was fun and I had gotten great gas mileage regardless of how I drove it. Recently I got a Mazda 3s and it is fun to drive but my protege was more fun. The biggest issue I have with it is yes, we get more performance but your gas mileage suffers greatly depending on how you drive. My style of driving has been the same and yet I'm getting just barely 22 mpg around town and if I'm lucky I'll get 28 on the highway. The car is a blast to drive but the 16in rims and tires make the car feel less responsive but otherwise it's a great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Honestly, best looking interior car in its class - Civic has nothing on this. Exterior is very stylish. 2.3 could do better on fuel economy, but it's still much better than a 6 cylinder. This the best car for bang-for-your-buck. You get so much - safety options, toys and gadgets and styling all in a very reliable lil car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Attention to interior trim detail - Silver trim. Seats are very comfortable. Gear box is short and sweet.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Being a honda and toyota guy for many years. I have finally step foot inside a Mazda dealership to check out the final year release of the 2009 Mazda 3 hatchback. Hey ,they are practically giving these away right now & with 0% APR. I like the styling , boy racer look thats me. I couldn't understand why I have bought and sold my previous 08 4 door civic si and 09 corolla s within 6 months time, their styling was not really my cup of tea. I quickly got tired of the 6 speed manual and ridiculous righ revs on the honda and the boring ho/hum corolla styling, and its slow/weak acceleration. Mazda did a great job with the exterior and interior styling. I added the 18"mazdaspeed wheels and I am done</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior and interior styling fits my style. Revs 2900 rpm at 75 mph. Nice upgrades for a base model, 4 wheel disc brakes, 17 inch alloy wheels, body side mouldings, wing, nicely designed front and rear bumpers, decent stereo. leather steering wheel. These are much appreciated by people like me.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought this vehicle for my wife 3 days ago. Prior she had a 4dr 1995 mazda protege and though she liked all the features what a step up! It matches all her wants and needs. Very sporty in look, feel and handling. Nice sunroof, sound system and interior. Feels like your driving a luxury car. It's also very easy to handle and park. Great value for the money especially since the 2010s are out and dealers are looking to move the 2009s! Highly recommended.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle at the very beginning of January this year (so it is difficult to estimate items like "reliability" and "build quality." I have thoroughly enjoyed everything about it so far. It's very stylish exterior is, in my opinion, best in class. It is fun to drive, handles well, and the 2.0L engine feels like a sizable step up from the 1.8L of my former Corolla. The interior is well-designed and comfortable, and the dash looks sleek (and the controls are easy to use, contrary to what I have seen in reviews). The fuel economy is perfect for me, even if not the best in its class. I get almost 30MPG off freeway. The value here is undeniable, so why wait? Get one now!</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you are looking for an inexpensive car with lots of features for your money, then this is the car for you. Handling is good, but you have to watch it in the snow belt when the rear end would like to trade places with the front on snowy roads due to it's light weight. Acceleration is adequate with the 2.0 engine. There is plenty of leg room up front for 6ft. tall drivers. Trunk space for a car this size is good. Fit and finish is exceptionally good. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I put 211,000 miles on my 1993 Protege without a fault. Bought a 2008 Honda Fit Sport 14 months ago and it was totaled. Drove the 2009 Fit Sport, Saturn Astra, and Mazda3 5dr and the game was over. The Mazda is much more car than the Honda and much nicer. The Astra is nice but awkward and the lack of an aux input for the MP3 player just shows a lack of consumer focus. The Honda feels "empty" and lacking when compared to the Mazda. The prices are all very close so it's a good comparison in my book. I'd like the sunroof to be an option by itself.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The clutch is awesome. Buy the 5-speed if at all possible. The Copper Red Mica is beautiful in the sun. The standard wheels are nice and the power outlet next to the aux. MP3 outlet is another great idea. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am a Mazda guy. I love Mazdas. My first van was a used Mazda MPV and when I sold it, I got 500 dollars with 340,000 miles on it. I recently had a 95 MX-5 and absolutely loved to just drive drive drive. Then I had kids. So I went out and bought a SUV. (stupid me.) So I drove this SUV for 1.5 years and it was dull. plus it didnt help that I was getting 11 miles per gallon during hard times. So guess what I did? I comprimised and shopped around test drove.

<TEXT>After owning Integra for 17.8 years, finally found something to replace it with. Nice size for one person, nice luxury features. Not as fun to drive as Integra but handles just as well, even better on fast curves, like it's on rails. Quietness masks real acceleration compared to Integra which was "throatier". A lot has changed in cars since 1991 so I'm still getting used to things like position of steering wheel (further away), thickness of steering column (limits leg room), the explosion of new technology, and in my case, four doors. Bose stereo is good but I do have to have the volume way up to level 40+ hear details (deaf in one ear so this may be me not the car). Mileage in upper 20s.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling is excellent. Feels like a luxury vehicle. Interior lighting and dash illumination are great. Xenon and auto windshield wipers are cool. Exterior styling is aggressive.

<TEXT>I bought this car after a lot of research and test driving (I think I drove the dealers nuts with all my questions!) and I have to say I am satisfied. The car is so much fun to drive and looks beautiful. I almost didn't get the S GT but was talked into it by another mazda owner. Am I glad I did! The heated seats are great, the Bose sound system is wonderful, and I love my sun roof. Don't bother getting the auto dimming rear view mirror, it's a waste of money. Although if I would do it again I would have gotten heated mirrors. If you throw snow tires on it it can also manage the nasty New England winters pretty well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The driving dynamics of the car are hard to beat. Snappy transmission, soft clutch, responsive steering, linear brakes, and agile suspension. The engine power is adequate, but well matched to the car. The interior is well appointed with leather seating, heated seats, moon roof, premium stereo (which is decent, but not great), and HID headlights. The materials feel of high grade, and the design is sharp. The only gaff is the crammed info LCD. The build quality leaves something to be desired. The interior looks fine and the gaps are minimal, but after only 400 miles, I've already got a ridiculous windshield rattle (ticking might be more apt) and buzz in the headliner near the moonroof.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first foreign car and she's not too bad. We bought the Mazda 3 i Touring edition. You see we drive a 2002 Vette and a 05 Tahoe so we are used to V8s. We looked all over and went through all the motions in comparing the Civic, Nissa Altima, Cobalt, G5 and G6 and the Mazda 3. In the end we decided that the Mazda 3 looked the best and the gas mileage was nearly as good or better than the others. We like the ride, sporty feel and its pretty comfortable. We also bought the version with the Goodyear tires instead of the Toyo for the winter time. I'm a bit disappointed with the mpg so far around 26 but I hear they need to break in so we will see. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty feel, comfortable. Decent amount of room front and back. Sirius radio. Manual shift feature. 17" rims.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the car and immediately went on a road trip. Handled well, many creature comforts for a car in this price point. MP3 Jack in center console is awesome. Glove box is huge. Average 33 mpg on hwy. Road noise is excessive and suspension is stiff, but sporty. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The '09 Mazda3 Hatchback is a blast to drive. It's quick and gets pretty good gas mileage. I had a VW Rabbit. I am sure Mazda3 is much better, with an easier 5-speed shiftable automatic transmission to work with. This car begs to go fast.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased my Mazda3 (5 dr hatch, 5 spd auto - Copper Red Mica) within the last month, after I checked out comparable models like the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic and determined they didn't compare. In my personal opinion neither were anywhere near the Mazda3 in quality of build, handling, response and overall driving satisfaction (definite zoom-zoom factor). The car seems like its rarin' to go right now but I want to ease into it and not push it too early. I am getting great mileage so far, especially with gas the way it is, and am very pleased overall. If you're looking for a great compact car with a lot to give - the Mazda3 is the "Ticket".</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The whole car is great... solid engine, smooth shifting (even for the 5 spd auto trans), great brakes and stereo, comfortable ride, steering wheel mounted controls and great gas mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought this car two weeks ago and have already put 600 miles on it. It's just so fun to drive. Even though I deprived myself of a manual transmission (it can be a pain on hills), the automatic transmission provides a fun acceleration. Very strongly built, I had someone bump into me (on the THIRD DAY of purchase!!) but thankfully not even a scratch on the rear bumper! The leather interior rivals my friend's BMW 3 Series, and the Bose System is very powerful. However, plugging in both my iPod aux cable and power cable at the same time gives minor buzzing sound (probably something wrong my cable).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>- Handling around curves - Bose sound system - Rain-sensing wipers (I live in Seattle!) - Xenon Headlights - Exterior looks with 17inch alloy wheels - Driver's seat is power adjustable! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this car a couple weeks ago and I absolutely love it. I bought the 3i Touring Value Edition in Galaxy Grey Color and paid 16489 before taxes and tags. The engine is very upbeat and peppy. Pretty good acceleration for only the 2.0L engine but I think its helped by a manual transmission. It handles very well with a tight wheel that is very quick to respond. I've been getting about 35 mpg on the highway. Gearbox is very smooth. Although on very steep hills there could be a little more torque in 2nd gear. The TVE upgrade comes with 17" alloy rims which are great looking. Ride is a little on the louder side, but feels like a sports car. Bottom line is great buy for the price. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought it. Already put fifty miles on it. I got the manual because it gets better mpg than the auto. I narrowed it down to a Malibu and a Corolla Sport and for the money this is a much better car. I test drove a loaded Corolla Sport and figured the Mazda3 was going to be too small for me but I was wrong and it is a blast to drive! I got the six speaker six CD disc that would cost an extra grand with the Corolla and this car has ABS and traction control. I recommend this car to anyone.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling capabilities in turns and awesome creature comforts. The clutch and gears work short and very smooth unlike many stick shifts. The brakes are excellent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the car last week and have put 600 miles on it. The 17" wheels and independent front and rear suspension provide unsurpassed handling for a car in this price range. The 156 hp engine provides adequate power and acceleration. The 5 spd manual gear box is smooth and predictable, seats are firm and supportive while still being very comfortable. Smooth and straight on the highway at 80 mph. The car gets a little sketchy when manuevering through the twistys on uneven pavement. The stock goodyear tires are hard and noisy, but provide adequate grip on dry roads. Braking is superb and this is one super fun car to drive for under $17k. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hatchback and rear folding seats provide great versatility. Independent rear suspension (only vehicle in it's class with this feature). 4 wheel antilocking disc brakes. This car instills confidence behind the wheel without having too much power to get into trouble.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my 2009 Mazda 3 S-Touring for just 3 wks. and a little over 1,000 miles, but so far, I love this car! I commute 50-miles per day roundtrip to work and traded in a 2004 Ford Ranger for the Mazda 3 in order to save gas money. So far, the car is averaging 29.5 mpg, and on the highway trip home from the dealership, the first tank of gas got 33.5 mpg, which is outstanding. The car is a blast to drive, especially on country back roads with a lot of turns. The exterior is very sporty compared to all the other economy cars. The interior appears very upscale and the seats are quite comfortable. Stereo system is also great & auxiliary jack for iPod is very handy. Great acceleration w/ 2.3L.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty looks, great acceleration & braking, handles very well, gas mileage is good considering how peppy the engine is, moonroof & 6-disc packages very nice. Auxiliary jack for iPod is awesome & keeps me entertained for my daily work commutes. Radio controls easy to operate, esp. on steering wheel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I never thought I would buy a Mazda but I am sure glad I did. This car is a lot of fun to drive & handles the road quite well. Extremely smooth ride more so than my 04 Honda Accord. I find myself sitting in the car after parking just to listen to the stereo (which I've never done in the past). I would highly recommend this great build of a vehicle. I plan on getting some options added later because I know I purchased a great car that I plan on keeping forever! :o)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the 2009 Mazda3 GT w/ Luxury Package in September '08. I have put close to 4k KMs on it since. I had compared it to several other cars in its price range; overall I am very pleased with my purchase. The combination of sleek exterior design, modern interior loaded with standard features, and quick and agile response and handling make this car a pleasure to drive. Features included with the GT trim w/ luxury package (i.e. moonroof, leather interior, Bose audio, heated seats, chrome door handles, modern interior and exterior trim/dash design, climate control, nice front grill, curvy where it counts) support the feeling that I got a ton of value for my dollar.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very quick and responsive acceleration and tight handling. Smooth transmission (5MT), easy and fun to drive. Sexy exterior styling, looks much sportier than the price suggests. Modern interior design, impressive dash and controls, lots of features and niceties. Lots of safety features are standard.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Owned BMWs for 11-yrs; got tired of expensive fixes. The Mazda has creature comforts not typically found in this class. Leather, heated seats, remote starter, Bose upgraded stereo, 4-wheel disc brakes. Very fun to drive, way better looking than anything in it's class (Honda Fit, Corolla, Civic). Fuel economy could be better, but a small price to pay with all the features and drivability. The interior fit and finish matches BMWs I've owned. I researched cars for about a week solid before purchasing and nothing comes close to the bang for the buck. The one major complaint - the horn sounds like something from a clown car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Follow up to my 8/26/08 posting. Just took the car from MI on a trip to Grand Tetons, Jackson Hole and Yellowstone. Back to MI, then over to Ontario and around Georgian Bay. Put on 4800 miles in 12 days through varied terrain. Got 31.6 mpg for the overall trip, car ran great, handled well and was very comfortable. Power is adequate 90% of the time. Cruised very well at the 75mph (maybe just a bit over)speed limit in WY and SD. The fully reclining & heated passenger seat is great for rest area naps. Bose stereo is very good. Strong crosswinds in SD (from Ike) could certainly be felt, but not too bad. Very good visibility. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, overall performance, gas mileage, good shifter, very good brakes. Comfortable seats for long stints at the wheel. Good headlights but a rather sharp cut off on low beam, even with the standard adjustment feature. Overall performance and creature comforts are very good for this class. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just got the car on 8/22, put on about 450 miles over the week end. About 30 mpg, mixed highway/city driving. Initial impressions: responsive, OK for power, nimble, good turn in with slight understeer (expected with front wheel drive), very good brakes and steering feel. Nice interior layout, good fit and finish. The Bose stereo, wiper controls and trip computer seem rather complex, but I'm on a learning curve. Great cargo and passenger flexibility. I wanted a well made, economical but still fun to drive little car and this fits the bill. At or close to best in class. My other vehicle is a '08 Ford F-150 Limited with a Cobra pack. A great truck, but not the constant $80+ fill ups.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Crisp handling, nice interior, very good stereo (Bose), moonroof, flexible cargo layout. Mazda has made this same basic model for several years, so the bugs should be pretty well exterminated by now. IPod hook up and concealed compartment is nice. Good paint and overall panel fit. </FAVORITE>
