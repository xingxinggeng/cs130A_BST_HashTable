<TEXT>This is the second Galant I have owned (previously had 2003 with 95,000 miles and that was a great car). Have had this 2009 ES for one month and have put 2,000 miles on it so far. Not a problem, not a strange noise, nothing. Very nice car. Great styling. Nice to have something a little different than everyone else has. Nice ride, love that ABS is standard. Comfortable seats. Very roomy. Very pleased so far.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable, love the satin mesai color (kind of changes from gray to blue to green depending on the light). Love the safety features and warranty, just in case.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car new one month ago and enjoy the ride to work everyday (city driving). My 6'3" tall but lean body build fits into the drivers seat with just enough headroom. The ride is a tad noisy from the engine, particularly with the high rpm's upon acceleration, but not so much to be bothersome. I don't care about the "plastic" interior comments from some of the reviewers. I care more about the small side-view mirrors and wonder why nobody has mentioned this. Also, the turning radius leaves a lot to be desired. Why can't I turn into tight parking spots? The trunk is roomy. The rear passenger space is roomy for a small car. The good crash test performance gives you confidence.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Attractive, sporty look. Zips around town and pulls out onto the highway nicely (for a 4-cyl). Adequate gas mileage. Nice sound system. Good handling on winding roads. Confident, low-to-the-ground feel of the road. Fog lights. Roomy enough for occasional 5-passengers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Mitsu. I?ve been driving it for about 2 months now in summer weather on both city and highway. I?m combining about 25 MPG on 91 octane gas, which I think is great due to the elements. The car feels sturdy and 2.4 MIVEC engine picks up well on sportronic mode. It has a roomy interior and comfortable front and back seats. The controls are well laid out for easy access on the go. It comes with high performance all season tires which comes handy on the east coast changing seasons. This car is great buy! Everything sums up to a comfortable, reliable, spacious, sporty fun vehicle to drive. I would recommended this vehicle to a small to mid size family looking for a 4 door sedan. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I?ve got the leather, sun and sound package on the base model. The 8 speaker sound is exceptional responsive. The heated seats, side mirrors and dimming rear view mirror are some of the features that I enjoy the most. Its SOCH MIVEC engine proves awesome low end torque and HP for a great drive!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Mitsubishi did a good job on the rear end of the 09, but hardly did anything to the front. The Sports Edition that I have does have the chrome top to the grill and darkened headlights but that's it. Its ok on gas and ok on comfort. On a recent trip, my backside really got sore so I assume the seats could have been made better. I do not like the waffle like dash, I can already see where dust settles on it. When in idle, you can't turn the headlights off, like when you're waiting for someone. To me that's irritating. There is not an accessory adapter in the console like the prior years did. Engine is very noisy compared to my 08 Camry, and the doors sound tinny compared to the Camry.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear of the car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a fantastic car! I can't complain about anything at all. I've never liked a car as much as I like this one; it's fierce!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rims, sunroof and seats are fantastic and it has a lot of "get-up-and-go" power.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just picked mine up today. After you factor price, 10 yr 100000 mile warranty, then Toyota, Nissan and Honda just don't make sense. So far, I've enjoyed driving it around. It's comfy and the 4 cylinder feels as good as any on the market. If you are in the market for a comfortable, modestly priced, long term family vehicle, not another run of the mil "Camry" like the neighbors, then buy this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the center dash, exterior design and wood grain accents. The stereo is pretty good and the seats are comfortable. I like the cloth seats in this car more so than Camry, Accord and Altima. The pearl white paint is classy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our first Mitsubishi. It was a nice car at a great price at 0% financing. So far we are really enjoying it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort, acceleration, style, feel. Love sun roof. Audio system is wonderful. Don't use the GPS feature as we live in a small town, but can see where that would be helpful in a bigger metropolitan area. Overall, we give the Galant Sport V6 an "A". It's a real thrill to drive :-)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car drives like a dream. I cant think of anything that I don't like about this car - very sporty looking starting with the grill to the tail lights they look like the Lexus tail lights. As far as the engine - lots more power than the previous 4cyl plenty of power. I can't think of anything out there that can compare. Overall a very nice car for your money...</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Galant Ralliart '09 is a very powerful and beautiful car; I love it. High points are acceleration, cruising power, sport leather seats, aluminum pedals, 20" alum. alloy wheels, stereo system, GPS system with many additional (and helpful) applications. Low points include cheap plastic interior, VERY tight suspension system giving a bumpy (and noisy) ride, adjustable seat limitation set too high, rattling seat belt mechanism, over-sized tail lights, and the GPS DVD player in the trunk is set in a very poor location. However, the Pros far outweigh the Cons. As an all-around sport edition of a mid-size car, I'm very pleased with it, but hopefully, the 2010 will address the low points.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Incredible acceleration; it takes off like a rocket in both automatic and manual shift combo. Leather seats, steering wheel, and shift. GPS system with extra features. Fuel economy. 3.8L MIVEC engine provide low RPM cruising power, gorgeous stereo system with Serius Satellite, and truck space. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Before I test drive my Galant, I had preconceived notions about the Mitsubishi brand. I'd always heard that they were unreliable, underpowered, and boring. But, once I put my foot on the gas, all of that flew out the window. The 2.4L has plenty of power, and has more pickup than my previous car, a 1999 Saab 9-3 turbo, even though it has less horsepower. The Galant rides perfectly on the highway, with some wind noise that some of my other cars didn't have. But, it handles better than I could have expected. Braking, accelerating, and cruising are all top notch.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of head room and leg room, good sized trunk, good fuel economy, and mp3 CD player with good sounding speakers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 3 used cars, the 09 Galant became my first new one and I love it! I came out of a 98 Galant and what a difference. I've racked up over 12000 miles in 5 months so I have a good feel for all aspects of the car's performance. I could nitpick and agree about the lower quality plastic interior and stuff, but that's not what I rely on to get me around town. The interior is driver friendly, spacious, and comfortable in any type climate. It pulls well going up mountains, downshifts nicely in bad weather and has smooth acceleration. I would wish for a few more horses on those short on ramps, but otherwise, it has plenty of get up and go.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the sunroof and heated seats! I wasn't too keen on the sport wheels, but when my friends told me how sharp they looked I decided to keep them. I also really like the overall body design. It tickles me to see people's faces when I tell them it's not a Lexus.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car w/ 16mi. on the odo. And put just under 2k to so far. I really like the front grille and tail lights for 09. I'm about 6'1" and it fits me perfectly. I had a 02 Eclipse and 00 Linc Continental. This Galant is perfectly wedged between those cars in terms of performance, ride quality, features, gas mileage and size. The Galant gets me from A to B with good sound from the 140w system, decent pep when passing hwys, great safety features.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Look for 09. Ton of safety features. Sound system is adequate (140w, 6 speakers with the Sport package). Reserved int and ext but different enough to stand apart from the other mid-size sedans.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The whole experience of the 2009 V6 sport is extraordinary! Extremely smooth ride, and when take off power is needed, it is definitely there! Very classy and luxurious look with its leather interior and sun/moon roof. Definitely puts my old 2007 to shame. Look out US and Euro competitors... you have a big problem on your hands.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6 months free Sirius radio, and the Rockford audio system is a great addition, and of course the smooth sound of the powerful V6 engine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just returned a Mitsubishi Galant ES '07 and was looking for a new car in or about the same price range. There really was no contest, Mitsubishi wins again. I purchased the 2009 Galant Sports edition 4 cylinder model. I am a big guy and have plenty of room anywhere in the car. The trunk space is huge. There are plenty of comfort features, heated leather seats, tire pressure. This model drives like a 6 cylinder and feels very sporty and has a comfortable sedan feel at the same time. The Galant is very reliable. For the money I feel this is a winner all the way.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the sound system, heated leather seats, the room and comfort. I also love the drivability and the feel of the car. The car drives like a dream and is very reliable, with a great warranty to go with it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I looked at the Camry because of styling, but after driving it I could feel the car felt more like a GM than a Toyota. I then looked at the new Accord and was overall impressed with the car, except for the comfort of the vehicle and ease of access to the controls. I even looked at Nissan which I said I'd never do again. The plastic interior still needs major improvement. Finally I figured I would look at the Mitsubishi Galant. The sport edition pulled me right in and for a 4 cylinder it has PLENTY pep. The handling is great and the car is extremely comfortable. Even the interior is top notch. I love my Galant. Toyota just lost another loyal customer and Mitsubishi gained a new one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mivec engine, handling, comfort and gas mileage. Getting 35 MPG!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall the outer styling is top notch. The interior is nice but leaves room for improvement. The plastics are cheap and that cheapness is everywhere. The plastic scratches very very easily. My car has 4000 miles and looks like it has 50,000. It has only one 12 V adapter. Cup holders are way to far back, seat heater buttons are in a horrible location. The car runs and drives great with the 4cyl motor. This motor does take a bit to rev up but then the power kicks in. By no means is this car fast from the stop, if you want that get that Raliart model. I have already had the turn signal break and the rubber on the brake pedal fall off ( warranty items). The gas mileage is not that great in town.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats, Stereo system, reliability</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having driven many different rental vehicles in the past two years, I had a good idea of what I wanted, and didn't want, in the vehicle I was buying. The 2009 Sports Galant from Mitsubishi motors is a great sedan with a moderate price. It reminds me of the Hyundai Azera but it costs several thousand dollars less. The 4 cylinder has good get up and go, and it accelerates quickly. The car handles well and the ride is very smooth. The car has a big trunk with the option of gaining more length by accessing the back seat interior. The car is the new canyon beige color and the exterior and interior is stylish. I am very satisfied with the car, and would have paid even more for it if I had to</TEXT>

<TEXT>We owned a Mitsubishi Diamante VRX 03 model and were looking to replace it after 5 years of trouble free driving, and found out the Diamante was discontinued. The other car makes were all test driven and some stood out more than others, like the Passat and Maxima sedans, and then my wife and I drove the 09 Gallant Ralliart. Well it rekindled our love for Mitsubishi with the build quality in the car plus the wonderful 258 horsepower 3.8 MIVEC engine and sport shift automatic transmission. All we can say is we recieved more for our money and fun for our dollar!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, transmission, new body style, projector headlamps, interior comfort and room, 360 watt 6cd satellite stereo system, heated seats, nice wheels and goodyears with tire pressure monitors.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Although Mitsubishi only made slight changes to the 2009 Galant, they seemed to pick the best features to improve. The ride is smoother and quieter. The new sport fabric seat is very comfortable and they even have power and 2-part heated fabric seats. They did away with the cheap plastic console and it look very tastefully elegant. A+ overall!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seats and the interior, plus the tail lights look similar to the current trend.</FAVORITE>
