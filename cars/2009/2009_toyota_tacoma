<TEXT>Have had 3 Toyotas 2 Tacomas and a T100 all have been good reliable vehicles. This access cab 4cyl is great riding and handling. There is some wind noise but not as much as the previous trucks. It's a truck not a Lexus. For those who are concerned about MPG this may be a truck to look at. I read many reviews and went on www.fueleconomy.gov and read the mpg's individuals were getting, not the EPA rating. They all said 21-22 something. I questioned it,but this does get 21 consistently with all in town driving with much stop&go. I am not punching hard on take offs but am not babying it either. Use it carrying wood for winter and it does it easily. Great lite-medium duty truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Well equipped for base model vehicle, p/w a/c overhead compartments, console, mp3/wma good sound. Composite bed. MPG is surprising for a 4x4 truck w/access cab. Good ride, between truck and car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased a new 2009 Tacoma in May of 2009. After purchasing, I began to notice significant transmission slippage when slowing to below 10 mph and then accelerating. I googled Toyota transmission problem and discovered many other Tacoma owners have the same problem. The dealership has been sympathetic, especially after they test drove my Tacoma and then discovered that every Tacoma on their lot had the same problem. They have told me that Toyota is working on a software "patch" to solve the problem. Please do not buy a Tacoma until this problem is resolved. It is dangerous to drive with this problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck is amazing. I got the TRD Off Road package and it rides like a champ. With the upgraded Bilstein shocks and better tires than SR5 model, the truck rides amazingly. Although I've only owned the truck for a very short time, I'm sure I'll be owning this very truck for many, many years to come.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Only had the Taco for about 2 days when I noticed the transmission responds poorly. Usually when making a left or right turn, as you slow the motor revs. If you're still rolling (less than 10mph) then accelerate, even gently, the engine revs up to 2K before clunking into second. So I've been left essentially stopping mid turn before pulling away. IMO, a dangerous design flaw that's going to get someone T-boned or killed some day. Otherwise, a pretty decent truck. Some of the interior plastic is a little cheap, but it's a truck, so no big deal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Pretty good MPG, truck bed is long enough for me, looks good, GREAT turn radius for a truck.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I would simply suggest anyone buying one pay particular attention to the automatic transmission. It is computer driven and you notice the transmission not engaging when it should after turns and when you start again say at a light and have not come to a complete stop. This could easily leave you in a vulnerable spot when you least expect it. Check Edmunds.com and read the complaints. Buyer beware as Toyota and the dealer will leave you high and dry with the phrase normal characteristic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck has had transmission issues since the day I bought it. Toyota refuses to admit it is a problem, even though it is well documented on the internet. Transmission continually slips when accelerating after a turn or even going over a speed bump. There is a clunking/jumping effect around 30mph when letting off gas then getting back on the gas. Also have had an annoying buzzing sound from under my glove compartment and a rattling window control panel. Body dents very easily. Very worried that transmission will fail before my 36k warranty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this truck only 6 months and the transmission slips. I thought the other day I was going to be T- Boned because the transmission slipped as I was leaving an intersection. I brought my concerns to the dealer and they took it for a drive. They found the transmission does indeed slip. They contacted the Toyota head office and I have not yet heard anything from them. Are they (Toyota) going to wait until someone is seriously injured or killed before they address this problem. I've been looking on different postings and I am not the only one with this problem, thousands of others too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very disappointed with the Tacoma. So far the engine sounds like a diesel engine, its burns oil when first started and the stereo has a mind of its own (on, off, on, off volume up and down by itself). Toyota factory rep. says everything is normal. It's safe to say that I will never acquire another Toyota again. Back to my Jeeps.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great truck and fun, comfortable to drive. I've only had it a short time, but know I will enjoy the vehicle. I know some reviews say the ride is stiff, but it rides more like a car than a truck. I got the SR5 package and have no complaints, wish my old 89 Toyota Truck had the ride this one has.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The big plus for this truck would be its quick get-up and go, it's only a four cylinder, but it goes. The bed liner and the adjustable hold downs are great. I do a lot of hauling, lumber and such and so far everything has been easy to tie down. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was being lured to the 09 Tundra due to my towing needs I have a 5000lb travel trailer. The dealership recommended I get the Tundra but I am not a fan of the tundra in short it reminds of a sports car. I want a truck that is sporty and functional the Tacoma fits this desire. I have towed my trailer with the Tacoma and it has no problem power wise. I would say you can feel the weight behind you but the Tacoma has plenty of power to handle it. The only complaint I could offer is the daytime illumination of the radio and compass isn't adequate you can't see the display if it's sunny. Other than that I have had the tire light come on and upon checking tire pressure they are fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my 99 GMC half ton on the "Cash for Clunkers" for a double cab TRD Off-Road and never looked back. I have wanted this truck for a very long time and I am not disappointed. Front & rear seats are big enough for 4 full size men and is comfortable on long hauls. Compared to the old GMC, the engine ad breaks are fantastic (don't see what others are talking about??). My only complaint is no XM radio?? The locking rear differential is a must have with the 4x2. Towed my 5,000 boat with no problem (need trailer brakes). Would recommend to anyone looking for a mid- size truck. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Only had my Taco for two weeks, but I love it! Interior is laid out logically, and is more comfortable and roomy than I expected. The engine is quiet and peppy even though the tranny has rather high gearing (75 mph at 2500 rpms). The 5sp manual shifts easily and smoothly. The ride is smooth and extremely quiet for a truck. Handling is average, but drives like a car on the highway. Radio and A/C work great. The standard tires and rims don't do much for the looks but ride great and are quiet.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the interior except for the low seats. The composite bed is great. A/C will freeze you. Quiet ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Drives like a car on the road most of the time. Drives like a sports car on the dirt roads. 4 seats - 9 cup holders. Very cold A/C. Surprisingly good on gas considering its size. Only real gripes are the always-on speedo lighting (fine until it's dark, then you become popular with the police 'cuz you thought the lights were on). And wipers. I live in the northeast - there is no intermittent setting on the wipers. My '99 base model corolla had that! If it's drizzling it's a pain to hit that every 5 seconds. You put a/c in the thing and power windows...and 9 cup holders. Couldn't you do that Toyota?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the reg cab base with AC because I plan on owning this truck long after most power options would fail. Occasionally I wish I had gotten power windows, door locks, and the rear window, but I can live without that stuff. I love this truck. I got sideswiped across the front by a red light runner going 40, and you could hardly tell the truck had been hit. It's tough. But mostly I love the confidence of everyone from my mechanic to strangers telling me it was a good choice. I paid the TMV out the door (incl tax and BS) so I got it for a good price. Edmunds was the best helper I had in the process. I took it on a long road trip up north and it did well in the mountains. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>City mileage 16 lead footing, 19 babying. HWY mileage was 29 on i95 and 24 in the mountains. I would have rather had vinyl seats and flooring, but the interior is very nice. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My previous truck was a "plain vanilla" 1993 4-cyl 2-WD Toyota pickup, so this was quite an upgrade. Power windows! AC! Reviews describing as a car on the inside, truck on the outside are accurate. Enough power so far, and the auto tranny seems OK. A great all-around vehicle for driving and light hauling.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior is great - well laid out, comfortable, and functional. Back-up cam is useful. Bed with a pre-installed liner and movable tiedowns will be useful. Ride seems quiet to me - only 500 miles so far.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2004 Tacoma for the dbl cab v6 and I am very happy. The interior is much better and I have the JBL sound system and it is awesome. I pull a 5200lb trailer with it. I was worried it wouldn't do it but was pleasantly surprised, you can tell it's there but the v6 has no problem towing it. The rear camera is a bit overrated because it's a bubble type view but after awhile of using it you get accustomed to it. Overall these trucks are perfect for the mid-size class.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the SR5 4x4 off road. The good - rides nice, has power, handles well. The Bad - auto transmission has no sense at all. Drops into 1st gear on slow turns and downshifts when it should not. Toyota refuses to address the problems. Seating is low and the lack of available power seats which I thought I could live with, adds to the mix... has me trading back to Nissan with only 3K miles. Tranny drives me nuts.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been wanting to purchase this truck since they redesigned it and I finally got it in June 09. I am very happy with my purchase. The truck rides great, handles well has plenty of storage and hauling ability. I got the TRD sport model fully loaded with every option I could add. I really like the JBL stereo but the sub in the back seems to vibrate the plastic interior on particular notes but overall it sounds great and was a good upgrade. The v6 has plenty of power and acceleration to merge on the freeway or pull out into traffic. I loaded the bed up the second day we had it with a heavy reclining sofa and couldn't even tell it was there when driving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've so far owned two 2009 Tacoma Trucks. An offroad model and a sport model. The offroad was totaled and I replaced with the sport model. Overall I like the truck and it's a keeper, nice acceleration, quality interior vs the competition, safety features are great - ie. my airbags worked on impact, and the frame crumpled and distributed the impact force properly where my cabin area stayed intact. However, I won't buy another 6 to 10 yrs down the road unless Toyota can fix the rough ride, the spongy brakes, and improve the fuel economy by at least 2 MPG for the 4X4 model.</TEXT>

<TEXT>TRD Sport SB: No adjustment for seat height or thigh angle. Makes it hard for 6'2" to get comfortable on long trips and get out from under the steering wheel. Tailgate still weak. Rear leaf springs are light. Backup camera is an overpriced gimmick. Seat fabric feels cheap compared to the Tundra. Mileage should be better. Cheap center dash and radio. Who cares about CD's now a days? No trip computer for real time mileage. Colors and digital displays are hard to read in sunlight. Doors seem flimsy or uninsulated. I expected this to be my 2005 4Runner with a bed, but it definitely seems "cheaper" all around. Costs an arm+leg once all the packages are included. Spongy brakes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Toyota and I bought it without a test drive. I think overall it is a nice truck with a good set of extras. However, given Toyota's track record of excellent and dependable vehicles, I expected a bit more for the $$. For a new truck, there is already an annoying rattle/vibration at low RPM and it is especially noticeable when it's cold. The transmission seems to hunt when it downshifts, giving the sensation that you are are driving on ice at times. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my truck for 1 week and I couldn't be happier. I traded in a 2006 Pathfinder LE for the Tacoma and it was the best decision I have ever made. The Nissan was not put together well and had rattles everywhere as well as a problem in the electrical system. The Tacoma seems to be built much tighter and better and has a great ride. It tows my boat without even knowing it it there. There is a slight rattle at 1100rpm in the passenger door but the dealership is going to take care if that quickly when I take it in for service. I would HIGHLY recommend this vehicle for anyone looking for a truck. It is simply put, A GREAT TRUCK!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the availability of the long bed with the double cab. The stereo is much improved over the old Toyota vehicles even though I would like to have the JBL system.

<TEXT>I have an SR5 model; wanted base model, but only exists in the brochure. Toyota was no help to locate one. I have seen this type of truck referred to as a Tar (Truck Car Mix). Gas mileage good (as good as my 93 4 cyl pick-up). Spongy brakes. Yes, freaky radio (turns on all by itself) and poor reception for some reason. The hunting transmission drives me crazy. Sensation like you're spinning your wheels on ice. Bed liner is slippery, but like tie down rails. Why can't Toyota start making what we want - manual 5 spd. Hope this is half the truck my previous 93 & 81 models were. I would have purchased American if someone made the extended bed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I needed a truck that could seat three people (including booster seats) in the back, have strong safety features, and still be able to handle off-road conditions for camping and hunting. I ruled out the Honda Ridgeline because its undercarriage is more vulnerable. The Tacoma is designed for high clearance, and low roll-over risk, which means the floor is high and the roof is low. The transmission and transfer case are well protected. Everything else, including Tacoma's flaws, derive from these design goals. The fronts seats are low. Toe room is bad in back. With side airbags and stability control, it is the safest thing out there. The roof meets 2010 IIHS standards for a "good" rating. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the SR5 model of this truck. I really would have liked a manual transmission but that was only available with the short bed crew cab. The transmission shifts smoothly but does seem to hunt in lower gears. The brakes are spongy as others have noted, but you will learn to adapt to them quickly. Very comfortable interior--very car like; but make no mistake, this is a truck through and through and will handle the road well when the pavement ends; I live on a washboard dirt road out in the sticks. Quite a bit pricier than the domestics but it will hold its resale and it will last. I know. I still have an '86 Toyota pickup that runs great. If you can afford to do so, buy one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's a little bit big for a compact/midsize. Despite what some people are saying, it's noisy (clutch fan and mechanical noises) compared to a lot of cars and SUVs. No alloy wheel option for the base model at all. Sits a little high for a street truck (2x4). It handles like a truck with no rear sway bar. ATRAC is a waste of money to me. ABS is OK though (expected now). Mileage could be much better with a little effort from Toyota. The body looks good for a little truck. I had a TPMS and radio problems, but the dealer fixed them. Toyota knows very well about the radio problems. I'm betting they have to replace about 75-100% after the sale.</TEXT>

Great truck, rides smooth, almost no outside noise, plenty of leg room for driver and passenger. Comfortable for an adult in the back. So many extra features I'm not going to try and list them all. Great for towing my wave runner. I could not be happier. The only thing I have a problem with is the transmission.

<TEXT>Bought the SR5 4 cyl access cab in Jan 2009. Hated to part with my 2001 at the time, now I'm really sorry I did. The 2009 Tacoma has the worst wind noise coming from the back. The seats are too low and not comfortable. Tilt wheel, what tilt wheel. It moves about an 1/2" up and 1/2" in and out. The windshield is so low it?s almost a problem seeing out. All around visibility to the outside seems less than my ?01.The radio does not pick up stations like my ?01 did. I?ve never owned anything but Toyotas, and I expected this truck to be nothing less than my previous trucks. I was wrong. The more I drive it the more I dislike it. This truck will be gone next year.

<TEXT>I recently bought a 2009 PreRunner double cab and the interior is very nice although I share the grip about the leg clearance under the steering wheel. I have to push the wheel all the way up and out and sorta wiggle my way in. The interior is nice otherwise. The transmission setup on this truck however is anything but nice and the brakes are too weak. The transmission hunts under 45 mph and the always on engine braking in "D" is VERY annoying. You can't roll down smooth. Also, the upshift to second is hard and the entire downshift from 5 (which the tranny races to get to) is hard in every gear. My '97 T100 was weak on power, but it was 10 times smoother mechanically. Unfortunate.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2009 Tacoma 4x4, Automatic TRD Sport with JBL, Long Bed, Tow Package. Purchased 10/2008 from Hometown Toyota in Ontario, OR. Good experience with dealer. Truck is really great. Performance, comfort, drive-ability all very good. Style and quality are better than any other truck on the market today in my opinion. Gas mileage was 18.5 average added K&N air intake and is now 20.5 average. Would like to see Toyota work on the gas mileage, should be better. Would also like to see Toyota offer leather seats, heated seats/mirrors. Price paid, less taxes, $29,600 Great truck, recommended.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The radio in this truck turns on and off at will. The driver has no control. Toyota is aware of the problem and will fix it in a few months. I have been waiting two months with not a radio in site. The problem is so prevalent that the radios are back ordered to the factory. If you like radio you do not want to buy this truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought the magnetic grey 4wd v6 automatic double cab w/ 6ft long bed w/ towing package. Looks are awesome! Inside is nice, love the backup cam. Says it can pull 6500lbs which is no slouch. I also found out how to disable the seatbelt buzzer when not wearing the seatbelt. Very cool feature! Even in winter the heater heats up super fast. Engine seems a little noisy though. Good power also. Basically a nice truck but to early to tell how it's going to do once I put some mileage on it. So far so good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this 4 cyl auto jan 2009. Rides real nice and has power for a 4 banger. But disappointed,whats with the cab wind noise. when going over 55 there is a lot of noise coming from back seat area. So bad I'm in process of buying insulation to make it quieter. I have owned a Nissan and Chevy truck and this Tacoma is the noisiest. The rear door seals with a crosswind sound as though a aircraft is overhead.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been wanting this vehicle for the longest time. The heavy snowfall in Erie sent my wife and me over the edge and we got the Tacoma. Simply love it. Tons of room in the cab for me (I'm 6'3") and a car seat in the back. This truck handles amazing in the snow and ice. I have yet to get stuck... and I have tried! The safety features Toyota put into this truck are really impressive and allow it to handle great in all conditions. Lots of power, gas mileage is not the best, however, its much better than other trucks out there. All in all, I am very happy with the Tacoma. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Toyota 4x4 pickup (also had 86 and 93 4Runners and 01 Sequoia). Still driving a 91 4 cyl, 5 speed 4x4 and traded off a 04 Tacoma for the 09. By far this 09 is the best! All the elements have come together in a great pickup. Ride is exceptional, power and performance outstanding under any conditions and it looks good too! I have driven city, highway, off road, good and bad weather and this pickup has not disappointed! I have the TRD Offroad PKG (can't live without my 4x4) with Towing. Interior controls are easy to reach and read with a quiet ride for a 4x4. Toyota, thanks for continuing the tradition of best in class 4x4!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This being my second Tacoma, I expected Toyota to have made an amazing truck even better. It is better in some aspects: size, comfort, ride, and amenities. But, one thing I have found so far is that this truck has many little annoyances. For example, the brakes are a joke. It feels like I'm driving a car from the seventies with no power brakes. I feel myself being very cautious when stopping at a red light - afraid I might just run over the car in front of me. Can't imagine towing a boat or a trailer with these brakes. Another thing is a mysterious sound coming out of the driver-side seat belt pillar. It sounds like a screw is rolling around in there. Very annoying. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After almost buying a 2009 F-150 4.6L, I decided upon the Tacoma. I was leery about the 150's fuel mileage, and checked many Tacoma Forums for their mileage assessments. That being said, I have NO regrets at all. The Tacoma, to me, rides like a car with the benefit of a truck. I owned two Ford Rangers previous to this purchase, and the difference is night and day. Interior is superb and luxurious compared to the Ranger's plain design. Seats are more comfortable but the seats are lower, which is the only dislike I have about this vehicle. I'd much prefer to sit up a bit higher. I feel a bit like driving a Miata with my legs out rather than in a normal sitting position. </TEXT>

Gas mileage is not much worse than my Buick Rendezvous in city driving. Acceleration is great, much more than I expected. Quality of construction and detail are exceptionally well done. Shoulda got the step rails though. At my age, they would've come in handy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is one incredible pile of junk. At less than 45 days following its build and less than 400 miles on the odometer here's the tally: underbody rust, rust and more rust; looks like the truck was built and then placed on the sea floor to cure; sloppy manufacturing permanently welded oxygen sensors into their threaded mounts; radio quit working; 4WD system engages only when it wants to -- not when you want it to; brakes soft as sponges; mystery rattle from right door pillar. This thing has a totally plastic (plastic!) box, I'm not talking a steel bed lined with plastic, but plastic! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck surpasses my 2 previous Toyota trucks in comfort and features, inside and out. Last Toyota was a '99 SR5 4x4. After 10 great years, lost to the '08 frame recall for which I was reimbursed . No other vehicle was better in its class. Looking at fuel prices and my new status as a senior, a modest baseline, 4x4 4 banger was my choice. I tested heavily before I bought, steep mountain grades on gravel to blacktop straightaways with 1/4 ton of clay aboard (quite a sight at the dealership!). Pleasantly surprised at power and agility. The 2.7-4 really performs, unexpectedly quiet, watch the tach. Front transmission is now on a switch - nice touch. Cab is roomy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bed of the truck is sprung heavier than the 99, like you are actually going to haul stuff! Liner is well designed for easy cleaning haulage and storage. Those extra 2 doors actually make the back useful. Better braking on bigger wheels.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I finally decided on the buying another Toyota after owning number of other cars in between, including a Honda Pilot and Volvo XC70. Wanted the cargo carrying capacity of a truck, but not something monstrous in size. But it seems like all trucks have gone on steroids over the years; the '09 Tacoma is bigger than the '00 Tundra I owned. Didn't get a 4X4 to save on purchase and fuel costs. Usual good fit and finish from Toyota; feels solid. Although compared to the Honda Pilot, not as well engineered: small things like the center console storage compartment that opens from the driver side instead of from the front that would allow better access to front- passengers; not as clever on storage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good power for a V6. Backup camera works well day or night. Built-in bluetooth is handy; especially in CA where hands-free cell communication is required. Like the XM radio feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 5th Tacoma and like all the others like it a lot. My son took my '04 4 banger stick access cab to college. So I picked up this automatic version as a replacement. So far I really like this bigger body style. I normally get the easiest color to keep clean but this new Barcelona red called out my name when I first saw it. I get many compliments on the look of the truck. Must say though I miss the manual transmission. I've been checking the fuel mileage and it is 24 MPG. I was thinking about getting a full size Ford or Chevy this time for less money but I'm really glad I stayed with the Tacoma. I think they are the best and most useful mode of transportation for my needs.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have my new X-runner for 4 days yet, very good truck. I read a lot on the net before I made the move because a lot of reviewers says the truck is very bumpy. After a road test of a 2006 one, I found the truck very comfortable. Yes it is a little bumpy but not really more than any other trucks on the market. Road handling is incredible, the trucks really eats curves. Lots of torque below 2000 RPM from the engine so it makes it very fun to drive, you can literally declutch the truck in 1st gear normally without slip, without giving gas and the engine won't shake or stall. Subwoofer is a good idea but is very badly calibrated, too much bass in voices when listening to radio.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I live in the mountains and have found that the 2.7 liter has more than enough power for effortless driving. I also have a 2006 Toyota FJ cruiser, 4 liter V6 auto, so it is interesting to compare the two vehicles. I have not found the 2.7 liter to be under powered, also the ride is more comfortable because of the longer wheel base. One of the reasons for getting the Tacoma was because of the good fuel economy that I experienced with the FJ Cruiser which replaced a Jeep Liberty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ok, I'm disappointed. It appears as though the comfort of the rear seats has been compromised because of the extra features that they had to come up with because of the competition. Am I the only one who has seen a change between 2008 to 2009?? Yes 2009 has newer features, finally side airbags! But, if you seat in the rear on the 2008 and then seat in the rear of a 2009 you will be shocked. I guess those new features need to be offset by compromising on the comfort?

<TEXT>The 09 is a great truck, lots of smooth power, good ride, bigger and more comfortable interior than my 97. Love the 4 doors (clamshell style). Happy with fuel economy overall, getting advertised numbers or a little better. Looked at 4cyl 5spd for better MPG but decided to go with V6 auto and no regrets. Stereo is OK for me, like the MP3 playback. Didn't get TRD, not worth the difference in price for me. Lots of new safety features on the 09 played a big part on my decision to go new. This is my 4th Toyota, 3rd truck and all have proven reliable so far. I loved my 97 taco but this truck is way better in many ways and I'm sure we will have a long, happy life</TEXT>

It's not as tough of a truck as I'm used to (No TRD pkg.), but the double-cab has great passenger room for a compact and the composite bed is big enough for the things I need. Got the bed-extender just in case it was too short. The 6-speed is MUCH easier to shift than the Ford. Only had it a week, but I haven't had to pull into a gas station yet! </TEXT>

I purchased the top of the line model, TRD Offroad package, with the Bluetooth and reverse camera. AWESOME features that are new to 2009. Love the LED taillights which are essential for the reverse camera at night. I also love the new Magnetic Gray color, which puzzles me why this color was never available on Tacomas before. This truck has exceeded all my expectations and I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone in the market for a mid-size truck. The only negative is the high price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have a '92 4X4 Toyota Xtra with a V6; 16.5 mpg at best. Was looking at an '08 ($1,000 rebate), but the '09 has better standard features; 6 airbags, 4-wheel ABS, plus traction and stability control. That, with the new for '09 Timberland Green color, swung my vote. Granted, the '92 is a 4X4, but the '09 rides so much better. The interior is a huge improvement - as some '08 reviews said, it's very car-like - although outward visibility to the sides is better in the '92. I live up a steep hill; the 4-cylinder has plenty of power and, contrary to some, I like the gated shifter. 23 mpg in mixed driving; less than 500 on the odometer. Expect to get better than the 25 hwy EPA once it's broken in. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Standard safety features. Interior appointments. Back-up camera (kind of "gimmicky" - but it works). Ride. Overall quality.

Only thing I am having trouble with is you cant hear the engine and it is a manual tranny. I have always just shifted on instinct and now I have to use a tach. I guess the trade off is the very quiet ride. All the standard safety features are nice (6 airbags, trac cont, 4 wheel abs all base model stuff now). I will get the monitor for the tailgate cam, will help with hooking up the trailer. This is my 8th Toyota vehicle, and it appears they have hit yet another grand slam.</TEXT>
