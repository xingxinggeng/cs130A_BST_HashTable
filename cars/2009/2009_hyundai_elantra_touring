<AUTHOR>I love it</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I bought my Elantra Touring 2months ago and I really love it! Particularly I like it's European exterior design. Good Gas saver also! Before I bought it I had drove 2001 Saab 9-5 which drove 20m/g(Avg). Now, I drive 28m/g (avg) with my Hyundai and I save 20$ per week. Moreover, handling is fantastic! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Needed a fuel efficient third vehicle for 52 mile round trip work commute. Looked at several small sedans but lacked space needed to haul horse feed and other farm items. Drove the automatic hyundai touring but seemed a little sluggish. Finally found a manual transmission and the drive was very spirited. Gas mileage in mixed driving around 31 MPG and just over 33 MPG on the highway. Wish it had a six speed transmission always feels as if you need to shift one more time. Plenty of torque nice and quiet below 4000 RPM. Good list of standard features for the price opted for the sports package with 17 inch wheels and sunroof.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Driving experience handles great stops on a dime. Can't beat the warranty. Nice and tight vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looked to take advantage of the C4C deal and needed a car for my wife that would get good gas mileage, not overly priced and room for my wife to put all her cleaning supplies in as she has a cleaning business. The elantra touring was perfect. Plenty of room, great road manners, quite and great warranty. She was driving a rodeo and at first missed the seat height of the SUV, but really loved the way the elantra touring drove. Every day she tells me how she loves her new car. Very very happy with the elantra touring.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I retired a '99 Elantra wagon with over 200 K miles having almost no mechanical problems, but like a lot of cars in the northeast, lots of rust. I was looking for another wagon and was really happy when Hyundai returned to the wagon market with the touring. I've had the car for a little over 2 months and 4000 miles and am very happy with it. I live in a mountainous area and average 37-38 MPG in mixed speed driving, all 65 mph or under. There is almost as much interior room as the '99 wagon. The seats are comfortable for driving long distances. The Edmunds site was very helpful in purchasing and knowing what price to expect.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Never thought I would like XM radio, but it's great. Wagon body style is great for carrying "stuff." Reasonably good mileage. Height adjustable drivers seat. Lots of features included at a reasonable price.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>SUV step down?</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>This is not a step down vehicle from a SUV or minivan as i was told and as i reviewed for several reasons. Do not get me wrong It is a good vehicle but it is not a step down vehicle as there are several flaws for it to be that. See below. also the hatch area is flimsy at best and do suggest getting a heavy floor mat as a jug of milk that hit the side actually dented the built in felt mat. Towing capacity is less then smaller cars I was looking at and so is usable space. No roof rack or attachments to put your own.all in all don't get a touring get the base model pick your own trim level. Get to another vehicle if you need any storage space over what a trunk will hold. This is disappointment.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks great I had to get the sports package as they where out of the lower package and made no difference to me. It looks great handles well. I Like the warranty and the brand They dealership is top in its class for service and now i see why. This is a perfect car if you want a small hatch back.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had my brand new Touring for 2 months until I was in the middle of a 6 car pile-up on the interstate. Needless to say, I hit my head on the steering wheel (no airbag deployed!), and my knee hit the dash/column really hard (no air bag here!). I've been waiting 1 month to get it back from the autobody and let's just say that once I get it back I'm selling it and buying something bigger and more substantial. I do not feel safe driving this car any longer. It's too small, and not built to withstand accidents. Look at the IIHS ratings not the other ratings for true information on safety!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great looking vehicle. Good get up and go. Fuel economy is not what I expected. I am getting 23.1 MPG in town. Took one long trip so far, and did manage to get little over 26 MPG on that trip. That was in the rolling hills of CA. I would question why AC in the glove box. My bigest complaint is the position of the steering wheel post on the lower part of the steering wheel. It is right where you would put your hands. I assume they had to put it there to support the air bag? It is unconfortable to hold the steering wheel on the lower part. Drivers seat could be fore confortable!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an ideal car for a small family. I have also owned VW GTI S I can't say that this even compares but my dollar bought one sweet ride. The real deal would have much more needed power and some quite tires they are really loud on some roads. Its a poor man sports wagon I hope I have similar luck with this Hyundai as others have with the Sonatas it seems like every body likes them even when they have hundreds of thousand's of miles. So as of now I only have a few thousand I would recommend this wagon to a friend or even my brother that I did. Good luck on your future purchase other cars to check would be Mazda 3 but will cost you a few more dollars and they don't have a warranty as good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely LOVE this car! I have yet to find something I really don't like about it. Best mpg to date is 37 mpg on a long cruise-controlled drive to New York state and back! Someone else, here, noted an issue with the cd player: cracks and pops from a brand new cd. But I don't care, really. Who even WANTS to listen to cds what with the fabulous XM radio music selection?! Contrary to my earlier request for more horsepower, it really doesn't need it. The Touring has ample get-up-and-go for this 55 y.o. And I'm still discovering neat design features that Hyundai engineering deserves great kudos for. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Headlights shutoff automatically when car is locked via remote. Five-speed manual transmission. Cornering capability. XM Radio. Plenty of storage in rear end. Plenty of passenger compartment storage cubbies. Comfortable cockpit. Excellent headlights.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When the Cash for clunkers was announced I headed for the Hyundai dealership and there it was. A Chili Pepper red Elantra Touring just begging to be bought. Took a quick test drive and told the salesman to put a sold sign on it. Easiest decision I ever made. I absolutely love this car. Quick, precise steering, peppy enough and, to my eyes, a beauty to behold (love the color). Throw in great brakes, XM radio, handling that makes Ozark mountain curves a blast to drive and lots of room to haul stuff in and you have one happy owner. I'm getting 29.7 MPG combined. The stiff suspension (which I like)is the price you pay for good handling. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy, well designed interior. I appreciate the little touches like the retractable tonneau cover in the back. XM radio was an unexpected extra that I enjoy. The brakes are exceptional! The exterior styling is as good looking as any hatchback on the road. Oh, did I mention the color? </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had a 1994 Toyota Camry Used with 235000 miles on it and I have had a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laradeo 2003 used with 66000 miles on it trust me the Jeep was by far the biggest piece of crap in the world. The Toyota well for the older car it was great on fuel but I couldn't ask for a better car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Its got the Jeep feel with GREAT fuel economy. It looks sporty and also has great looking wheels and the radio is great with the XM in it. I am planning on having the sunroof put in around tax time, but the chilli pepper red is sharp looking.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a great little car. There are very few options you can add on to this car as it comes very well equipped. The elantra touring is the same model as one they sell over seas and it shows in the handling, the car handles like a sport car. It comes with eltronic stability control which also helps in this department. I got 30 mpg second tank and the driving consisted of about 45% city and 55% highway driving. I love the bluetooth which will dial your cell phone with voice commands. The only dislikes are the dinky horn, come on Hyundai with todays quite cars it likely won't even be hear if someone has their Windows up and the radio on, also the key and remote should be combined.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got this towards the very end of the clunker deal. I settled on getting the Touring after looking at a variety of hatchbacks, from a Nissan Versa at the low-end to a Subaru Impreza at the high end. Unfortunately for me, these things are extremely popular and after looking for one for nearly 2 weeks, I got the color I wanted (Vivid Blue) but I didn't get the premium package I wanted in time(sun roof, etc.) Immediately noticed is the quality of the interior and how pleasing it is to look at. I'd say only the Mazda3speed is more sporty looking. Got the Automatic & drives like a breeze. Not real sporty but way more so than my old Pathfinder. All in all, a great car! Highly recommend it! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior is surprisingly nice, in my opinion. XM Radio, Ipod hook-up. Speaker system is nice. Comfortable and smooth drive. Pleasing exterior. Better than advertised gas mileage. (about 32 hgwy). Very quiet inside. Great AC. Plenty of compartments for stuff. TONS of cabin and luggage room!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We wanted to downsize from a Ford Escape, without giving up too much room, and the Elantra touring has turned out to be an excellent choice. Looks like they took all of the good features of all the other look alikes on the market and put into this model. Its got just enough more room in it than the competition to be noticeable, and comes standard with all the features we wanted. So far we're getting about 30 mpg in mixed driving. We bought a Mazda 3 5dr last year and between the two, the Mazda's a little more fun to drive - better handling and power, but the Hyundai is more comfortable on a long trip.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of inside room and very comfortable for a large driver like myself. Lots of nice small touches, holder in the right places, controls very logical, retractable privacy cover in the rear - they really thought out this car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Good fuel economy. Comfortable seating. Plenty of back seat room. Poor ride. Feel every bump with the Sports package tires. I wanted a small hatchback type vehicle to take the place of my mid sized SUV. My other car is a Toyota Camry and the ride in the Touring is nowhere near that.

<TEXT>Although we only have a couple of hundred miles on it so far, I've driven many cars over the years and feel I am qualified to offer my thoughts on this car. While many wish for more HP, I feel it is satisfactory for what the car is designed to do, get you from point A-B as economically as possible with as much comfort as possible. This car achieves these goals. The steering is certainly lacking that "Hug the road" feel. The brakes work well with plenty of stopping power. I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better bang for your buck. The best thing is that the S.O. loves it and when she's happy, the world is happy! Safe Travels.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove Automatic version of Elantra Touring and felt its slugglish climbing steep hills near Ski lift areas, so naturally I chose manual transmission when I purchased the vehicle. And.. Voila! It's surprisingly fun to drive. No problems at all climbing steadily at AVG of 29.8MPG up and around Mt. Baldy and Big Bear ski resort in So Cal. with 2 adults and 3 teenagers in the car and snowboard gears on the roof. The fuel consumption on HWY is very good at 35.4 MPG. I use this car for commuting to L.A. now. The car is a turnheaded one too since there is only small numbers in So. Cal. I 've got compliments from strangers often at the parking lots. Inside is so quiet, only heard when over 4rpm.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>easy & smooth shifting,great upscale looking-beige- and quality interior, impeccable exterior, quiet, comfort ride in long commute,safety feature, car's stability on the road, excellent braking system,no nose dive. Enough torque for mountain range without sacrifice MPG like SUV and fun to drive 5spd</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well here's an update to what I already have. Just took a little trip to cape cod. The car went 188.5 miles on 4.8 gals. of gas. That's 39.2 miles per gal highway at 70 mph. I think it would have been higher if we did not get stuck in a 5 mile crawl to the Bourne bridge. In city seems to be about 31.5 miles per gal. The ride was very comfortable. No back pains like in other cars. The car handled great on uneven surface for repaving. I am loving this car more now than when I first got it. Good going Hyundai!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plenty of room. Good layout of all components. Great car so far. Will wait for winter to see how it handles then. XM radio great. Plenty of power outlets. I pod hook up easy to use.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted a car that I could haul my stuff with ease and room to spare. I test drove everything in this class, and some larger, and found nothing that compared to the Touring, especially in its generous features. My touring has solid handling, turns on a dime and delivers everything it promised. I love the sporty exterior look and the roomy interior. I am amazed that Hyundai could offer so many features for the price...sunroof, blue tooth, xm capability (3 months free), 17" nitro-fill tires and much more, . The others I tested couldn't come close. This sweet car is a keeper! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy to enter and exit the vehicle (seats are a nice height). Large cabin, easy fold-down rear seats (no need to remove rear headrests), lots of storage cubbies, easy-to-read dash and nice blue color, blue tooth, XM radio, nitro-fill tires, sporty styling. Roomy seating.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this car for 3 months and finally saw another one on the road, but not in Vivid Blue like mine. I already have 10K miles on it, and have only had one problem, that being the CD player. It handles like a BMW and almost drives itself. Fuel economy is as expected 27-32 MPG, averaging 29 MPG in mostly highway commuting. It is very comfortable and easy to climb in and out of. Luggage space rivals an SUV. The open air feel with four windows and a sunroof has my Harley sitting in the driveway and forgotten about. The dash lights are also attractive as everyone else says. When you open the door after refueling, the odometer lights up for you to jot down the mileage. It's the details!!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The unique iPod cable needs to be purchased from Hyundai, but then you get to select more than 3000 of your favorite songs from the knobs on the stereo and the steering wheel. This rendered the satellite radio and CD player as both useless for me.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It is my first time to own a Hyundai car but so far after having driven 3k miles, I am more than convinced that I made a right choice. ET (Elantra Touring) has more features than any other cars in its class for less $$$. Better gas mileage than my previous 2.0 Mazda Protege 2002 and city/highway combined getting average 30 mpg. My 2 kids have more than enough space in the back. Good cargo space and well thought out dashboard design. I just had a trip of 400 miles but didn't even feel fatigue. USB connection (I don't even have iPOD) gives me more than I need, that 8GB flash drive can store plenty songs that I can control from my steering wheel.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the Touring for a few months now and am very happy with it. Fuel efficiency with 60/40 hwy/city miles sits on 29.9 mpg. On 2-3 hr. trips the average has bumped up to about 31 mpg. I have never cleared it completely out to measure efficiency on only a long trip. The back is huge, both in terms of seating room and storage. Loading and unloading is a breeze as the cargo area is wide, flat, and at a good height. The hatch door is not too tall to reach when I need to close it and I am short (5'2"). Visibility is amazing out the front and the rear is okay--the d-pillars create a bit of a blind spot, but it is well compensated for with the mirrors. Lots of cubbies. Comfortable.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth connectivity; not the best set up but it works and is useful. I love the steering wheel, it is just the right chunkiness. Metal shifter knob just looks and feels good :) Well placed displays and controls for everything; easy to use. Great mpg., very cute, SPACE</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After trying out the Matrix, Dodge Caliber, and Mazda 3, the Touring came out on top. The list of standard features is impressive for a vehicle in this price range. Features like 4 wheel disc brakes with ABS, Electronic Stability Control, power windows, key less entry, heated rear view mirrors, to name a few. It even comes with Nitrogen filled tires and nice mags. The ride is smooth and the feel is solid and quiet, again exceeding what one would expect in the price range. The interior is nicely laid out, the fit and finish is excellent, and you gotta love the blue lighting. The interior room for the size car is impressive. A real value for the dollar.

<TEXT>This is a great car for the money. It is a sporty hatchback that is quite roomy inside and big enough to haul all my "stuff". Didn't want an SUV but did want the convenience of a hatchback. I test drove all cars in this class and this one won hands down. I averaged 32 on the highway recently and in the city around 28. The Touring also has great safety features.</TEXT>

I LOVE my red, chili pepper Touring! It's sporty-looking, vibrant and fun to drive. All that plus the roomy interior, ample cargo space, and zippy engine I'd learned to love in my original Elantra.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Instrument panel full of great info. Steering is tight and responsive-fun; very pleased with response time of brakes, too.

<TEXT>Driven a Civic, Corolla, Matrix,Vibe, Mazda 3 and the Hyundai Touring came out on top. The Mazda was fun to drive, but it is smaller and cost more. The others did not compare in quality and safety features. In 2weeks I have driven 80% in city and a 200 mile trip on the interstate and winding roads and the touring handled great. Quite cabin, cruising at 65MpH with plenty of zip (ok it is not a sports car but it has enough for every day commutes and highway use. Great cargo space. Fit and finish excellent and safety features sold me. Some complain about steering feel, but in my case the wagon handled better than my 2003 Honda Accord.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Lots of interior room for SUV owners like me looking for better gas mileage. Steering is a little strange but getting used to it. Power to weight ratio is not very sporting but can keep up with traffic. Driver's leg room is shorter than specs suggest. I've never had a car that stopped as well. Styling is very Euro and to my liking but doesn't turn heads. Nice exterior finish and good quality materials on interior,(no mouse fur). Some sloppy workmanship in more hidden areas, i.e. messy chauking in door jams. Wiring looms hand wrapped with cloth electrical tape,(didn't know they still made that). Getting 23mpg in suburban driving. That's almost double my Hemi Durango!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2000 Elantra for this new Touring. You will like the new improved model. Outside the car it comes with a euro-style which is a much better upgraded than the old Pontiac nose. Inside plenty of room. Seats are very comfortable front and back. Plenty of hiding place for stuff. AC glove box to keep a can of soda cold or medications cool in summer. Radio is great for what you get, it gets the job done. The motor has good pick up for a Wagon, that's what it is. Would like to see a 2.3 or 2.4 liter motor though. Getting 30.7 mi. per gal. Over all good price and ride for a under 20,000 dollar car. Warranty can't be beat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car (my second Hyundai) a couple of weeks ago and I love it. I picked the car up on my way out of town for a weekend road trip (500 miles round trip). My destination was in the Tenn mountains, on the way back I got a surprising 38.9 mpg. The ride was very comfortable and pretty quiet. We put the back seats down and filled the cargo space with donations for a local food bank, it held over 600 items with room to spare so we only had to make one trip. I live in Atlanta so my city mpg has only been around 25, I expect that to improve as the engine breaks in. Rick Case bumped up the warranty to 20 yrs, 200,000 miles so I think I will keep this car for many years. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Had a 1992 Honda Civic hatchback before this and wanted another Civic but I found I could get more for my money with the Touring. I've driven if for about 600 miles so far and I love it more each day. It has everything I was looking for and more; good safety features, lots of cargo space, fun to drive, my tall friends say the backseat is much more spacious than expected and very comfortable. I got the vivid blue color and it's awesome. I also love the black interior but it does show anything left behind of the fabric like lint from clothing. I would suggest the sports package (sunroof, 17 inch alloy wheels, and heated seats). I'm getting on average around 24-25 MPG (mostly city driving).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comes with a lot of extra features I wasn't even looking for but I really like them. Sunroof, fog lights, silver trimming on knobs and lights, XM radio, iPod adapter (although I've only used XM radio so far), display blackout, steering wheels radio controls, cruise control, perfect arm rest location</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm "stepping down" from a decade of owning cars costing $10k more. I bought this for the high reliability (I'm expecting) and the value it represents. It may be hard to wrap your head around that fact that this is a compact car, with a midsize wheelbase and tremendous interior space. It IS fun to drive, though not sporty, but torquey, taut and surprisingly refined. It's not fast, but competent and capable around town and on the hiway. It has a "do anything" demeanor, but rides like a car, not an SUV. The biggest drawbacks being the 4 speed auto, oddly weighted steering and the 2L engine that makes only 140 Hp. But brakes are excellent, built quality high, and the interior well thought out.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Am getting about 28mpg mixed. I've got bluetooth, which is okay. Have all my music on a USB stick, plug it in to the "secret compartment" and 170 watts sounds good enough. Oh, and the dash lights in red, white and blue - very classy. All in all, the cabin is well appointed and fun for the price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've owned it for over a month and had one long road trip. We've loaded it with 3 passengers and 18 2"x10" four foot long boards along with a roll of fencing. We love the capacity and functionality of it. It was comfortable on the trip. Gas mileage was decent, but a 5 speed auto would be great. We've been getting ~26mpg and that's mostly around town including a carpool line. Considering it is a compact car, it's a great car for a small family. We got the premium package and the ride isn't very bumpy. We also haven't found the steering to be vague as mentioned in some reviews.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>iPod adapter, interior layout, cool blue lights at night, heated seats and cargo capacity.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wanted something smaller that my Camry, without giving up comfort or rear seat space. This car has both, along with a big cargo capacity due to hatchback instead of a trunk. Compared to the Toyota Matrix, the Elantra Touring has more standard safety and convenience features, and slightly more space. The 2.0l engine with manual transmission is a great combination - very good acceleration when I need it, but the gas mileage is much better than EPA rating of 26 overall (more like 30 but haven't been running the A/C). Haven't had it out for a long trip yet, but for commuting and light hauling, this is a great size and a comfortable ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM radio, standard safety features, good space for passengers and cargo, sporty handling in a practical car. Ability to black out the radio display at night is a nice touch.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It's been only one week, but I love it! Great improvement over the old one I was driving- much more comfortable. I never had any problems in six years which is why we bought another one. I can't believe all the standard equipment it comes with. Very fun to drive and sporty looking in the silver. Got right on 26 mpg city on the first tank. Can't wait for a road trip!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>all standard safety features, XM radio and sunroof, large cargo area</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in a 1999 Mitsubishi Mirage DS for the Hyundai Elantra Touring. Wonderful drive, nothing bad to write about. It's the Euro Wagon from Hyundai. Price was much lower than a similarly equipped Mazda3.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Hyundai, and the largest one I bought. I love this car, it is easy to drive, maneuver, and I haven't found any negative features. Still haven't figured out if it's a car, crossover or what, but who cares, it is a pleasure to drive. I saw this car, searched for an automatic, and bought it at once.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought an 09 elantra touring on Monday. Got $500 of sticker, and $1000 rebate. Prices will go down more, since this is a brand new model, but its a great car. Peppy acceleration, tons of room and legitimate 30+ mpg highway/26 in town. 100,000 mile warranty too</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>shiftable automatic (slap sideways to go from 4th to 3rd), fuel economy, acceleration, standard abs, esc, traction control, disc brakes, heated mirrors. huge cargo area behind the 2nd seat. huge legroom in the second row</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought the new Hyundai Touring brand new to this country. So far it has been fun to drive. I like the way it handles in the city.It was between this car and a Honda Accord. The touring sits up a little higher then the Honda. Also got more for my money and a trip odometer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like how the dash board lights up with displays (LED lights)</FAVORITE>
