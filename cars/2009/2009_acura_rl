<TEXT>I traded in my 2.5 year old Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland loaded with everything for this vehicle. The interior trim is excellent; the Nav system is far better then the Jeeps and as good as my husbands Audi A-8 system. The ride in this car is excellent, the vehicle is extremely quite and the sound system is exceptional. I am so pleased I purchased this car; I looked at the Cadillac and the Lincoln...the quality was no match. I believe I will be an Acura client for my next purchase too!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav system with live traffic, Vented seats, nice looking dash, excellent quality, extremely quite. Voice control works great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As a business executive and also a mother, I wanted a vehicle that exuded class without snob appeal that needed little maintenance and had the room for my clients as well as my family of four. I found the exterior to be stylish, the interior incredibly plush and the surround sound audio system unbeatable. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Hard Drive navigation system can reset my destinations on the fly, give a three day forecast, reroute my course in the event of inclement weather or traffic stoppage and even make or change my service appointments for me! Who needs touch screen while driving? It even recharges my Ipod with USB!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>For someone who has never owned a decent car, I imagine that they would think the RL is great. But I have had so many reliability problems with it, I will NEVER buy an Acura again. The handling is pretty good, the car is fun to drive, even though it is slow. Overall, I would rate it a 7 out of 10.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice chassis dynamics, turns great at any speed. Navigation system is stellar. Nice steering wheel. Comfortable seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our second Acura. Over all this is a nice comfortable car. Long trips don't beat you up like some can. The AWD is rock solid on icy roads. My only gripe is that I have had problems with the heater on days that are below freezing. Even with the temp control set at 62 the passenger compartment gets very hot. Then it will turn on the ac and blow cold air into your face. Three different dealers couldn't find anything wrong. The car, compared with other 09 Acura's, when tested above freezing temps, are identical. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great seats, radio, ride, easy to understand and operate controls, quiet.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Acura. I have driven about 4 different cars over the last year one of them in the same price range. I am impressed about the handling, the feel of quality material used, the quiet engine (the others had V8s). I enjoy just to go out and drive it, especially on curving roads. It feels like the car is glued onto the asphalt. The bumps in the road of course can be felt, the don't make you feel uncomfortable. The interior feels quite roomy. The interior design looks awesome. The price is on the low side of its class. I put reliability in with 8 points because I have owned the car for only one week. I have had not problems so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just upgraded from a 2005 to a 2009 RL with tech. Fabulous car. I can't imagine how anyone could actually drive this against the Lexus GS, the Infiniti M, or the 5 series BMW and not buy the RL. I suppose there is a lot more to luxury car buying than performance, price, features and road feel. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bullet proof quality from top to bottom</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second RL, having returned my leased 05 for an 09. The best thing about this car is the way it makes you feel when driving it. With the SH-AWD, the bullet-proof nav system, the world class vtech engine and the solid suspension; you can drive this car with complete confidence that you will get where you're going and get back. To me, the most important thing about a car is that I trust it. I have never had a car that I trust (or enjoyed) more than this 09 RL. Complete reliability, safety, luxury and comfort. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The driver interface on all levels exceeds every other car I've tried. Every aspect of the car can be customized and is at your command if you take the time to learn the protocol.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really enjoy driving my new (09) RL/w Tech Pkg. I own a 06 (TL) prior. The fuel consumption is high, about 16 city 22 highway. I replaced the factory tires with 245-35-20, 8.0. This was a great enhancement. I plan on driving my RL a lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Very happy with the look and performance of the 2009 RL. Looked at several cars in the same class and felt that the RL had more for the money than other cars. Once you get used to it, the technology package is great. Handles well with it's all wheel drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Test drove the new Jag, Bmw 5 series, Infiniti M, Audi A6 & A5 and Lexus LS and GS. Basically I was not going to buy a car this year because none of them seem worth the bucks or worth the change from my Lexus LS 430. Pictures of the 09 RL do not do it justice. Went to Acura to look at the 2009 MDX (for my wife), saw the RL on the floor and looked in the interior. I drove it and fell in love, the handling the no-lag speed and pick-up the luxurious interior with all the gadgets done tastefully. Pinch me! I am a car snob and never even considered an Acura, I was wrong and now I am happier than ever (with more features than the BMW 535xi and saved over $10,000). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Technology in this car is incredible. Best navigation system yet, puts BMW to shame. Seats are as comfortable as Lexus with cool and heated ventilation. AWd is the best I ever driven with a great suspension, stereo is top notch.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Acura finally got this thing right. I put 13000 miles on my '08 RL and had a love hate relationship with it. The car had terrific build quality and extraordinary features that really spoil a driver. That being said there are significant faults: poor suspension (a weird combination of too harsh and too soft), no adjustable passenger seat, wimpy steering wheel, AWD system with too much front wheel bias. Biggest fault... no EQ (excitement quotient) when driving the RL. Enter 2009 RL. Love or hate the looks that's your decision. I love this car. The suspension is perfect, great Super handling AWD calibration, adjustable passenger seat, a whole bunch of "EQ". Did i say I LOVE THIS CAR ?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had it a week and I'm very pleased. Wanted a sports sedan with all the luxury/tech appointments. Drove E-Class, 5-series, M-35, 09 Maxima and Lexus GS. No major weaknesses vs. competition. If you are looking at this class, test the RL. Improved low end torque is a big plus vs. 08 model. Not as fast off the line as the 535, but as fast as the rest. Sports mode helps with initial acceleration, but not necessary after that. Quiet smooth ride. Not as noisy or bumpy as the GS and doesn't feel like a big boat like the M-35. Technology and radio are excellent. Interior comfort is awesome. Other brands more recognizable, but this is a better car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior comfort and quality materials. On screen iPod integration. Acceleration and handling. Lets me drive in great luxury without screaming to everyone that I own a $50,000 car. Not everyone will value that, but if you do, then you'll know what I'm talking about.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>acura nails it with 09 rl; looks are great inside and out; have 05 rl, which has been excellent; 09 looks better, drives more in control with road; drove m3; nice car, overpriced, not particularly in control of road; drove audi a6; tired look, overpriced when compared to all options built in to base rl; drove m 35; same old car, also not competitive price-wise if you load up the options to compare it with the rl; gas mpg is strong for awd; very hard to beat without spending at least $10,000 more on competitors</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>surround sound; awd handling; improved low end torque; sporty look</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is one nice car!! Very quiet with and excellent radio. Controls can be a little confusing until you know where all the controls are. It's best to practice a little before you go on the road and want to change radio channels or map functions. I get a lot of AHHHs from my co-workers when they look at the interior styling. I bought a bright silver exterior. The prominent "transformer shield" grill blends in nicely. Not so with darker colors, in my opinion. The tail end looks fabulous!! Definite BMW 7 series resemblances. Very powerful acceleration. Great control over rainy roads with the SH-AWD. Gas mileage isn't great, but it's not bad either. On par with a 300 hp car that's 4,000 lbs.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Flawless interior, quiet, great radio, stunning rear end, more power and torque over last model, cooled seats. 18 inch wheels look great. Very comfortable for 4 people. Could be driven coast-to-coast with no muss, no fuss.</FAVORITE>
