<TEXT>Overall I'm very pleased with my Xterra SE. Something I haven't seen mentioned here is a recent recall I was told about through a Nissan mailing. The mailing states that there "could be" a bad weld on the torsion bar and to schedule an appointment with the dealership and they'd diagnose and repair at no cost if necessary. The dealer informed me that they needed a special welder to do the repair and they didn't have one there. They are supposed to locate a business nearby that can handle the job and contact me. They also said that Corporate Nissan informed them that this recall is for ALL Xterra's- not some of them. I felt a bit deceived by the mailing at that point. Otherwise, I'm very happy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound System, Blue Tooth, XM all work great. Very happy with the exterior looks and interior versatility. I camp, mountain bike, carpool etc... and it's very capable in all areas.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased new 2009. Rockford Fosgate sound system above average, nice technology package. Combined gas mileage (20% city, 80% hwy) is 21-22 mpg. Looks nice, rides comfortably, but I'm having hard time adjusting from previous full-size pickup truck. I am 6' tall, and I feel a little closed-in. Short arm rest is more like an elbow rest... it sucks. Test drive was good, but after a month I'm not so happy. 6 cylinder engine seems to have sufficient if not awesome power. Back seats are nice to have, but not much room for rear passengers unless you scoot front seats up. Plastic console dents easily (don't drop anything on it). Vehicle is shorter than some cars. Mixed feelings, but quality vehicle</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quality, gas mileage, appearance, premium sound system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been a Nissan Frontier owner since 1995 and have been very satisfied with the quality and engineering of Nissan vehicles. Recently I began looking at the X- Terra. I was happy to see that Nissan has continued with their quality in workmanship and "thinking of the little things" like the door in the skid plate that allows you access to the oil filter when changing your oil. The interior is well designed and the ride is comfortable. For anyone looking at a mid sized SUV I'd give the X Terra more than just a passing look.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Oil filter access and ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great news for the SUV enthusiast. Nissan has really done the trick with the Xterra. Nimble on road, capable off road, easy on the wallet, outstanding performance. I'd throw stones at similar sized SUV's by the other manufacturers. This vehicle has long been a hit for the market niche and I would recommend the average individual who needs a slightly larger vehicle to take a test drive. The fuel economy is exceptional for the type of vehicle and its capabilities.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This my first Xterra but seventh Nissan. It's hard to beat a Nissan vehicle. The Xterra is a great SUV to drive. My wife calls it my "sport truck". Besides a great price my Xterra also came with $1300 of free electronics upgrades. The Rockford Fosgate sound system is great, much better than the Bose I had in my Pathfinder. The Blue Tooth hands free phone is also great as is the XM satellite radio. The Xterra handles extremely well and is a solidly built vehicle. The 261 h.p. engine is typical Nissan quality - great quality and performance. I've never had a single engine problem with all my previous Nissans. In summary, I am totally satisfied with my new Xterra. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Value, quality,solidly built vehicle. especially like the R/F sound system and the Blue Tooth phone. Engine is powerful and reliable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second xterra, my first was a 2000 SE purchased in 99'. There is no other suv out at the moment that I would rather have (excluding the larger BMW X's and infinity QX56). My 2000 only gave me a fuel pump problem (replaced by dealer on a recall) in 100,000 of driving, with very bad maintenance record after the 2nd year, changed oil every other year. So I figured I pushed it to the max (last day came back from the jersey shore at avg.80MPH and it was time to get a new one. I love my 2009 off road - the sound system is awsome. The truck, well I'll just let it speak for itself. now if I can just pay this sucker off I would be the happiest man on the planet.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, ready to rock and roll like a Transformer. The engine sound when you turn the transformer on. The sound system. The am here to kick butt not to just look good attitude. The fact that everyone knows that there is more that meets the eye. The utility of the beast. It Rocks like no other.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have a place in the Western NC mountains and wanted a vehicle that could handle the old forest service access trails/roads. Began looking at the FJ but the back seat just didn't cut it. I had been trying to get the off road Xterra for six months. They are hard to get right now. This truck has a much better highway ride than I expect. On mountain highways there is very little lean in the curves. Gas mileage is better than I thought. The only negative so far is the XM radio which regularly drops reception even on Interstate highways. I am going to have that checked out. BTW the short center arm rest is no problem at all.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Off road lights, hill ascent and descent, off road clearance, steering wheel audio/bluetooth controls, pretty much everything else too</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I initially wanted an FJ, but I checked- out the Xterra and was very pleased. I showed up at the dealer looking for an offroad and was informed they were next to impossible to get in my area. After much deliberation I opted for an S and never looked back. I'm very happy with my xterra, the night armor looks great and it is a very capable 4x4 even without the offroad package. But really I can put in an airlocker and heavy duty shocks if needed. Mine came with the free technology package and I love it, the hands free bluetooth has been great and the rockford audio is quite enjoyable. It has an actual back seat as well and four doors. The utility of the Xterra can't be beat. Has 4x4 gas mileage</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love all the tie downs, the hard plastic rear and the muddy storage in the back and in the roof rack. Sound system and bluetooth, Good visibility and power. Fully loaded the S is a great performer and you can get a good deal on one.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second xterra. First was a 05 off-road 6speed. The new one is the same. 6 speed off-roads are soooo rare, had to jump at a new one. Still the best all around choice in a respectable 4x4 suv that can go "off-road" for real. But would like lower gears and a little more ground clearance. On the road, if you like power, this is the suv for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>For under 30k you got something that really goes. Can chirp tires when you hit second. And it can go off road,even has a low range and a locker.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Lots of power, handling is great, sits up high. Good vision, interior all leather great sound system. Exterior is rugged looking. Gas mileage 17.5 highway. I new that when I bought it. Wish I had heated mirrors, surprised it was not part of se package. Drove through snow storm in Michigan truck handling was super. This is very well made truck. Very happy with Nissan. Towing atv and snowmobiles and all of our gear and four adults was no problem.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, handling, towing, great driving vision, sits up high, stereo system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wow, is all I can say about this new Xterra. I just got this 09 Off Road X and I think it was the best decision I could have made. I traded in a 06 Rubicon; the Rubicon was a sweet ride but not travel friendly! Really bad gas mileage; like 9.4 miles per gallon on the highway. I got rid of the jeep and thought I was going to get the Toyota FJ, but ended up coming home with the Xterra. Reasons: I can see out of the X, the X doesn't need premium gas, the X has four doors, and the off road packages for both are the same. After driving each for a whole day the winner was the Xterra. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks, and Nissan isn't going to stop making the Xterra any time soon!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Awesome. I purchased the S with tech package (Rockford Fosgate premium sound system, 6 CD). This is my second Xterra. I previously owned a 2002 for four years. Love the sharp interior styling. I am still exploring the many features of the newest Xterra in Red Brick (gorgeous!). I love the molded water bottle holders in the doors and the tucked away cup holders in the back and several well-placed areas for all the things you need to take with you. Great change is the hard plastic lined cargo area (beats previous carpeted cargo area). I loved my 2002 and I know that the 2009 will not disappoint. Plenty of power and room. Fun to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love it all!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have the S with tech package, 4WD, 6M. I rented a 2006 and traveled 2000+ miles and it was a rough ride at that time. Nissan has made some wonderful changes in the suspension and engine power. The 2009 is more sports car than SUV. A true joy to drive. Very little road noise. Hands free blue tooth is great. The Rockford Fosgate music system is out of this world 8 speakers and a sub-woofer. The back seats are stadium placed so that the back seats are higher than the front. Lots of cargo area. This is my 3rd Nissan the other 2 (Stanza & Altima) I got 190,000+ miles out of them. I know that this one will do the same. A week is hard to tell much about a car, but it's long enough to say it's great</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Every thing about this car is a favorite. </FAVORITE>
