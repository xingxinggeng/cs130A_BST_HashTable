<TEXT>I got this car after owning many minivans. Most of the time I don?t have my family onboard, so it is a waste of $ and fuel to drive around a bigger size vehicle. First time for me to own a foreign vehicle. Overall I am impressed with the quality of everything, everything works nicely together. I love the small sport-sized steering wheel, good handling (some body lean, though), no squeaks & rattles; overly well built. Fuel economy so far is not that great (about 23mpg average), but having just 1,700 miles, I hope it will improve with time. I miss the illuminated power window switches - mirror switches which I use once in a lifetime is lighted, but window switches are not (except driver's)!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Small steering wheel, sporty feel, good handling, no squeaks or rattles, quality of controls, knobs & stalks. Cruise control are nice on the steering wheel, but too dim. I also love AUX IN, but it's very difficult to reach w/ 1 hand.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Very nice car, very reliable, I don't even think will I make it anywhere. Great gas mileage. Assembled in East Liberty Ohio with 60% US part contents...check out some Pontiacs G3- G4s, etc. Some 100% Japan. The only bad thing I have to say about the Civic...that it wouldn't hurt to get some snow tires for snow, my escort handled better in the snow. Other then that, I always get people looking at my car, very nice looking car and great style.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have 9000 miles on my Honda Civic. This is the 5th Honda I've owned and one of the best. I average 44 MPG after 9000 miles and yes I keep track after each fill-up. It's fun to drive and I really enjoy the split dash design. It has adequate low end pickup but highway passing won't set you back in the seat. The car excels in its mission of mixed highway and town driving. The ride is sport-like but some may call it harsh. It has a tight firm ride which I enjoy. The fit and finish of the interior is excellent. I would recommend more outlets in the front interior area, but this is a rather picky criticism. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Split dash, excellent gas mileage and driving characteristics. It's fun to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my third Civic and I absolutely love it! Hondas are simply reliable and low maintenance. Everyone comments on both the exterior and interior! I find it to drive very smoothly and haven't found it to be loud. I've been in my friend's Cobalt, talk about loud and obnoxious! I have had the car for a little over six months now and I've had no problems. I commute a pretty far distance and have also taken a long road trip. The gas mileage is great as well. I do mostly highway driving and average about 35 mpg. It's so fun to drive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Not sure if the city mileage rating is for less densely packed urban areas, but I drive around Chicago all day and get about 18 mpg in the city. I haven't done much highway driving yet, but those times where I have, I'm pretty sure I'm getting over 30 mpg. My Civic only has about 700 miles on it (it's hard to rack up miles in the city), so I'm hoping once it's fully broken in the mpg will get a little better. It's still a lot better than my old '95 Explorer which got about 8 mpg in downtown Chicago. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had no problems with the engine, but everything inside this car rattles...the dash, the door panel....and it drives you insane!! Poor, poor fit and finish. Sounds like loose change is inside the door. Took to dealer and of course they drove it on a smooth road and "couldn't reproduce". Also when steering wheel is in upper position, can't see the odometer. Automatic locking everything also drives you insane when getting groceries etc. out of the trunk and back seat...the doors keep locking (found a way to disable the rear door auto-lock, but the trunk eludes me. When you close trunk, doors automatically lock...then you have to unlock them again!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went to the dealership to talk them out of their last S2000, however, they were still very proud of it, although it was a brand new 2008 model, and I was trying to purchase it in June 2009. I test drove many vehicles. I had previously owned an RX8 and had already wanted a NA high rev. engine. After I test drove the SI I was sold. Fun to drive, affordable, cheap insurance, great build quality. The car has a great platform to add aftermarket parts at a reasonable price. Maintenance is so much more reasonable than the RX8. Granted, the RX8 is unique and handles like a dream. The Honda is just a great value for the price! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>K20Z3 engine, great gas mileage for a fun car, great seats, good stock sound system (I love the USB port!), looks sexy - esp. in black, handles like a gokart, price is in reason for us middle class folks who do not want to give away their first born or take out a house loan to finance.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my 2009 EX for 3 months now and love it! Much more comfortable than the Corolla that I used to have. No complaints from me. There are times when I start it up it takes a couple of extra seconds to get the engine running. I've discovered if I park on the smallest hill sometimes there's a 'clunking' noise as I shift from P to R, also there are times when I shift from R to D I've noticed the engine accelerates a little as the tachometer indicates, but other than those minor things the '09 Civic is definitely an awesome car to own!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the dashboard design. One of the main reasons why I bought this car. Quite comfortable as well. Very convenient steering wheel audio and cruise control buttons.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car is pretty everything everyone says it is. It is my 5th Civic and so far, the best of them all. One thing I can attest to is the ride quality if your lower the air pressure by two pounds. It calls for 32psi, but at that level the ride is rather stiff. If you lower the air pressure down to 30psi, you will find the ride quality greatly improved without a loss in fuel economy. Since these tires do not last for much more than 30K, you will not lose any wear in dropping the pressure by 2 pounds. It will make a huge difference in the ride quality. Try it and you will see for yourself.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really like the dashboard layout. Having the digital speedometer on the second tier, I would actually consider a safety feature. It allows me to keep my eyes more on the road, by not having to look down as far to see my speed. I love the black seating in the LX-S, but as others have stated, it does attract the lint. Really love the gas mileage and the handling. It has the typical Honda suspension that you feel the road bumps and hear the road noise. It is fun to drive. Great visibility all around. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage is better than I expected. Have never had a fill-up less then 30, and have had as good as 38.5. I love the handling. Like the dashboard layout. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the Civic GX because I love the idea of using natural gas instead of petroleum. The engine is smooth, although somewhat underpowered. The car handles surprisingly well, despite having a big (and obviously heavy) tank behind the back seat. I average around 37 mpg, in mostly freeway driving. Mileage drops considerably on short city trips. Dashboard layout and visibility are excellent. The driver's seat unfortunately is undersized, poorly designed and uncomfortable (the seat in the Corolla is substantially better). E-brake in the knee underscores that the Civic is designed for small drivers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Having been a GM fan for years, I see what I have been missing... I am impressed with this vehicle I have had it for a week now, and I can't stop driving it. It makes me want to drive, is fun to drive, gas is great! You can't go wrong with this choice, in my opinion. At least test drive one and you'll see what I mean. Good resale value as well. Lease rates are amazingly low compared to other Japanese automakers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Civic for about 2 months now and I really enjoy it. I did a lot of research prior to purchasing this vehicle and it has lived up to almost everything I heard/read. I love both the interior and exterior styling -- the two tier dash is my favorite. The quality of the interior materials is far beyond that of some of its competitors, namely the Toyota Corolla. I read some other reviews that complained about the lack of a remote trunk release, 60/40 rear split seats, and outside temperature gauge: All of these features are available on the EX trim. My only complaint is the gas mileage...I average about 27 mpg. Based on my research, I was expecting better fuel economy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Couldn't spring for the Insight because I got a great deal (21995) for this beauty. Just took a 500 mile trip down I95 and back to Northern Va and averaged 51.1 MPG with my wife and some luggage. No hypermiling used except I got in the rt lane behind a slow driver on the Interstate and I tried to coast in neutral down hills and build momentum for the next hill. In the 163 mile stretch from Fredricksburg, Va to Chesapeake I averaged 54.2 MPG. The overall 51.2 included about 35 miles of city driving in Norfolk. The car is solid and drives smoothly and handles better than the 09 Prius. I think Honda does a great job with their cars. The 09 HCH is a stealth gem waiting to be discovered.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fit and finish and the design in and out makes this a near luxury small hybrid. Mileage is terrific and I only have 1400 miles so far. The USB adapter for the I touch is great and the hands free Blue tooth and voice command Nav system is easy to use. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this car a few months ago and love it. Sporty,looks good, comfortable,solid,and performs well for this class. Not the fastest per se, but balanced in all areas. Opted out of the summer tires because of snow, and it still handles great. Have owned Hondas for 21 years now and I don't regret this purchase at all. 2 tier dash works really well,stereo is decent and USB system rocks. Combination of size, handling, efficiency. The ride is firm, but not harsh, I don't understand all of the complaints about road noise. It is competitive with others in the class. I still love the high revving nature of Hondas,over brute power.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a long time manual transmission driver and after an extensive search thought I'd found the perfect car. This car had the style and comfort unmatched in it's price and class. However, after two weeks of driving this vehicle the transmission started to get very notchy in second gear especially when cold. Once winter hit the problem became noticeably worse to the point that it actually jumped out of second gear on several occasions. By mid-winter I didn't want to drive this car anymore. I took it to the dealer but they could not duplicate the issue when the engine/trans was warm and they checked and flushed the trans fluid. I traded this car after 4 months and couldn't be happier.</TEXT>

<TEXT>7 months ago I bought a 2009 Honda fit with 5 speed manual, I decided to sell it and get a faster Honda civic coupe dx. I cant believe how much faster the civic coupe is with manual transmission than the fit and it handles so much better and looks better. I will never ever buy any other car than a Honda civic coupe. It feels like you are driving the fastest car on the road all while using no gas. Honda makes best cars in the world PERIOD.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned this vehicle for almost two months now and this is the first car I have never had to take back shortly after purchasing to have squeaks fixed or rattles fixed or adjustments made. Honda really has really got their act together. The first month or so the ride was a bit choppy but on the second month the suspension seems to have loosened up a bit and the ride is much better now, I am coming down from a much heavier car that did have a nicer ride to it and it has taken a while to adjust. Quality craftsmanship every place I look, everything is put together very well. I am a little disappointed that the trunk lid does not have a liner on it, no computer, and no intermittent wipers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first hybrid, but 5th Honda Civic. I briefly left the brand for a 2008 MINI Cooper S, but quickly returned to Honda. The quality of the car/pieces in my opinion or better then most luxury vehicles. Compared to my MINI without the sport package the ride in the Hybrid is quite and heavenly! The Hybrid in real world driving handles far better then my Cooper S. In the MINI hitting uneven pavement jerked the car around. The Hybrid hangs on to the curves with the same go-for-it'ness and absorbs bumps without drama. Per the OBC I avg 31 MPG in the Cooper S, the first week I got 45.7 MPG in the Hybrid. None of my Civic's have left me stranded. This is why I returned back to Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall satisfaction is great, just a bit upset about the MPG, getting an average of 26 mpg with normal driving. Car handles very well and the steering is tight and responsive. Engine could use just a bit more power, but still not bad. Cold morning start is a bit rough. Road noise is present, but not too bad. Very reliable car, wish it had a better warranty just for the piece of mind, needs to be 5year/60k bumper to bumper especially for the price. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Preface: I did my homework, and shopped around pretty extensively. I knew what I was buying (an economy car), and held the civic to those standards. First, a few minor quibbles: 1. Thickness and durability of the paint is disappointing. I'm finding too many chips on this young a car. 2. I can't locate the source of some random clunk coming from the right rear wheel... Other than that, all I have for the civic is praise. The car handles famously considering its class and competition, and the ride quality is uncompromised. It's solid, doesn't get flustered over bumps, and inspires much more confidence than my previous car (a 1998 Audi A6). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I waited for the '09s specifically for the USB interface.. and I'm glad I did. The stock radio sounds great for a car in this segment, the manual transmission is buttery smooth, and I love the styling, inside and out. Win. Oh, and 31 city MPG makes me happy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had purchased a 2009 Honda Civic EX and then decided I wanted the hybrid with everything. So I went back to the dealer and got the 2009 Hybrid w/ leather and navi in silver. They were giving about $4k in discounts so I couldn't pass it up. So far I like it better than my 09 EX because of the gas mileage and cool blue leather interior and navi.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is real quick from 60-90. Has some road noise, but the 350 watt sound system can correct for it. This car is a real show stopper for $22K, with at 7 sec 0-60. A must test drive if you are looking at the IS 250-350 (smaller interior) or the Acura TL. The resale value makes the Si a real choice over the Subaru WRT which costs almost twice the price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>On my first drive, I was a little concerned about the Hybrid's ability to merge with traffic but very glad that I took the second drive and bought it. No problem in merging. I agree with First Honda that the Civic (Hybrid too) is a really fun and peppy ride. Also agree on the driver's seat being extremely uncomfortable. I too am 5'8" and have back issues anyways but there is no lumbar support on this vehicle. No problem with visibility and foot seems to remain on the pedal fine. </TEXT>

I almost went with the LX-S, but decided that for an extra $1,300 I would rather have the sunroof, UBS connection with a great stereo, 4 wheel disc breaks. The car is very fun to drive and rides a lot better than the coupe a test drove. Will see how good the mileage is. </TEXT>

<TEXT>THIS IS MY FIRST HYBRID, and it's only a day old or so. I wanted to write about my first impressions and a few months from now, I'll write again. First of all the ride is smooth and solid. With the CVT, SHIFTING IS SEAMLESS, because there aren't any gears, just one consistent motion. The style looks like a Civic, so don't expect people to stop and notice your new Hybrid. However, you can smile and know how your new car isn't thirsty for gas, and the stereo is top notch. The interior leather is very comfortable, and the blue luminous gauges have a futuristic look and very easy to read.We got a fantastic lease, $305/ 36 month. Only first payment down, plus they paid off our other lease, 2months.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth ride and great interior. Radio w/6 speakers and reads my iPod and displays titles and artist. You can control your music on the steering wheel. The dark blue leather seats. Very comfortable! The car's color, Magnetic Pearl.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Hondas just seem to get better and better. I do however have two minor comments regarding my new Civic. First, the accelerator's new throttle-by wire technology performs well, yet the feel of the accelerator is awkward to me. The pedal is hinged from the floor and I find it a little uncomfortable situating my foot at times. The other item relates to the transmission. The automatic tranny seems confused at times whether to stay in second gear or revert to first when executing slow turns or "California stops". This confusion can at times result in an abrupt shift of the gears. Other than that, not much to complain about. Hats off to Honda for building yet another great car! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Let me start with I checked out just about everything out there in this price range and took my time making a decision as I did not need a new car but rather wanted one. After looking for over a year I decided on the Honda Civic EX 5 speed and so far am very happy with it. The car rides nice and handles very well for what it is (I had Miata's, and MG's before this) the deciding factor was the Honda's resale value compared to everything else. If you are looking for a well built, fun to drive and reasonable cost to operate car look at the Honda Civic! The EX model has all the toys you need, sunroof, 4 wheel disc brakes, cruise, and a decent stereo system. I paid 17,451 including destination. Love IT.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a fantastic car overall, quite comfortable and very well executed. Just gave back leased 2005 civic and bought this one with all the items EX- L model. Surprised at how innovative this car is compared to the 05 and that's meant in the best way possible, if shopping for a new car in this price range or even a slightly higher price range, give the civic a drive, you'll enjoy it. One piece of advice is to make sure you do your research on not just the car but the dealership!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my Civic now for almost a year. I find it a fantastic car for the price. It will cruise all day long effortlessly at 70 mph and get me 38-39mpg with the AC off. Now it won't win any drag races but it has plenty of power for my day to day needs. I really like the dash set up and I think the auto transmission is very smooth. Lots of leg room also for my 6'4" frame. My two kids fit fine in the backseat. The trunk holds more then I had originally thought. I have had no mechanical issues in the 9,500 miles I have driven the car and average 30-32 mpg in my daily driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Really fun and peppy ride. The only problem I have is with the driver's seat. I'm 5'8" and find the seat extremely uncomfortable, digging into my leg underneath and my foot falls off the pedal to the right. To be expected for a compact car I guess. I wonder whether it's just me or if others are having similar experiences with the car seat? Also, there is no visibility in the front or back. Parking not easy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far so good. This car is everything that I expected. Great gas mileage 33miles/gallon mix city/highway. Not especially sporty or exciting to drive but to get to work and around town works well. This car doesn't accelerate from a stop very well but then this is part of the gas saving component. I believe a model equipped manual transmission would improve this and be more fun to drive. But for me not practical since I drive in stop and go rush hour traffic daily. This car does have a significant amount of road noise but no more so than other cars in its size class. One other item that is an annoyance, the fabric (black) on my LX-S attracts lint and hair like a magnet. Is hard to keep clean.</TEXT>

Audio is a little weak, but it can be enhanced easily with aftermarket. Only filled up once and with a combination of city and hwy, got 30 mpg. Road noise is a little more than I expected, but ok. Instrument display is great, handling is quick and acceleration is what you should expect for this class. Interesting to note that the Civic is now just about as big as the previous Accord that we had (1993), although it weighs a lot less. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior, exterior styling. Overall build quality. Solid handling. Very good mpg for a non-hybrid. Just plain fun to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Honda makes one of the best stick shifts in the auto business with the Civic Si. Short throws and creamy smooth shifts. Performance is great for a 4 cylinder (2 liter) engine without a turbo. It's a rev happy car which performs best at 6,000+ rpm's, and the engine sound is sweet at higher revs. My car is black which is hard to keep clean but looks great when it has a bath. It's a head turner. Gave it a 9 on reliability but that's just based on Honda's past reputation cause I've only had it a week with 400 miles driven so far. I leased it for 3 years so it's covered by limited warranty. If it proves reliable I will purchase another 3 year lease. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded a 15 year-old Saturn with manual steering and only 37,000 miles so this car is a real treat. I did a lot of new car research and frankly don't understand some of the negatives expressed on Edmunds. The Honda is comfortable, the two-tier digital speedometer is no problem, the emergency brake handle is not a problem. Stereo/CD player sounds great, can't really tell about fuel economy yet, had to warm it up a lot this winter. Variably intermittent windshield wipers would be nice, but not a big issue. Took me 3 months before I had 600 miles to finally get to use the cruise control and it's fine. Some want a remote trunk opener on the key? Oh please, I mean opening a trunk is difficult?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I took this car for a ride on CA State Route 1 (Pacific Coast). I have to begin by saying that I am not impressed. This car has a serious blind spot problem. Too much of blocking when you do a head check. Leather seats are of bad quality. Sound system needs improvement. I am 5'9" getting in and out is very uncomfortable. Audio unit gets heated up. Inside cabin is noisy. Wondering what would remain on 65MPH head on collision. I was shocked to see the design design beneath the bumper. I would rate safety features somewhere between 3 to 4. AC units has problem. Not sure if I can recommend this car to my friends. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So far I am pretty happy with my purchase of a Civic. Overall, it's what I expected. There are a few surprising issues. Most notably, the car has a tough time starting when its cold out (under 20 degrees). I live in the Northeast and that has been rather often this winter. The windshield washer nozzles have also been freezing up since I've had the car. It doesn't handle well in the snow but I expected that since it's so light. I do like the reliability that comes with the Civic and it does ride well. Also, the gas gauge seems to underestimate the amount of gas in the tank. I actually was driving with no bars on the gas gauge, so I rushed to fill the tank and I still had about 2 gallons left.</TEXT>

I like the split dash as everything is right there. The road noise can get loud sometimes, but it's mostly only noticed when the radio is off.

<TEXT>I've always liked the Honda Civic. It's got great looks and the mag tests say it sets the standards for other small cars to match but I'm disappointed. The road noise in the cabin is just horrible with the Civic and for me it's really a big distraction that's keeping me from enjoying this car. Too much gear whine from the drivetrain too. Road noise in the cabin is the biggest flaw with this car. I like the rest of the car, but it's not really any better than the other cars in its class and you pay more for a Honda and get less features for your money compared to say a Toyota. The Civic is a nice car, but it's a noisy car and pricey for what you get. Do you homework before you buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my LX-S sedan for a few months now, and all has gone well except for one persistent issue that has popped up since the weather has become cold. When the car has been sitting for a few hours in temperatures below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, the car will often not start on the first try, or the car will start and then die out. The indicator window on the battery states that the battery is fine. On a brand new car, this is unacceptable. Come on Honda don't skimp on batteries with decent cold cranking amps.</TEXT>

The navigation graphics are dated (same or similar to those which debuted in 2006), but the system is integrated quite well and the information presented is all helpful. I have yet to get a single voice command to work, even after reading the manual. The engine is quite free revving and the transmission and clutch combo is sublime. It is not a particularly fast car, but the best version of a proven car with a fantastic stick.</TEXT>

In addition, Honda customer service states the MPG is actually normal for winter driving for Missouri. Dealer failed to inform us of this when we purchased vehicle.

<TEXT>I have been driving the car for 3 days now. I commute 150 miles each day. The first day it ate fuel, the 2nd day not so bad, and by day 3 it is improving more. The best part: I do not get robbed at the pump! I have the FuelMaker FMQ2-36 instead of the Phill unit. I waited 3 months to get that and it is nice to just back into the driveway and plug the car in for the night. FuelMaker needs to step up availability. My fuel bill for gasoline would be over $13,000 per year and this cuts it down to a more tolerable $3500 per year. Much easier on the pocket book. I am going to install another 2 gallon tank in the trunk to up the capacity to 10 total this spring. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After having my 2009 Honda Civic LX-S for less than a week, I can say that I'm really happy with the purchase. The ride is smooth, so far it handles very well, the MPG are great (although I haven't filled up yet). Also, the interior is laid out very well. Everything you need and very easy to use. I'm a big fan of the black interior with the leather wrapped steering wheel in the LX-S model. I would advise anyone who buys the LX-S to buy the fog lights as an add-on, as they add a pop to the car. Also, this car looks so much better in person than in the pictures. In pictures this vehicle does not stand out, but in the road it does. Very happy with this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at Toyota Corolla S which is slightly cheaper than this Honda Civic LX. Honda civic provide a better grip on the road and fun to drive. I have the car for almost two months and I averaged like 30 miles per gallon on both city and highway. Very agile and preppy comparable to my Acura Integra. I love the double cluster gauge specially when you are cruising. It gives you the exact mileage. The least favorites are the following: 1) No trunk remote release for this model. 2) The plastic are easily marked. 3) 40/60 split on the rear seats. Now is the best time to buy a Honda for you can get more than 1,000 off the MRSP price of this car. </TEXT>

This generation of Civics reminds me of the Accords from years ago, and this is one thing that attracted me to the new Civic.

<TEXT>My 2009 Civic LX feels as good if not better than my previous Mercedes C Class cars. The Civic is all grown up, providing plenty of comfort and space. The build quality is exceptional. This car feels very solid yet eats up the local mountain roads. The handling feels planted and sure footed. The steering response is positive and easy to judge. Pure pleasure on a twisty road. My only complaint is the radio. The speakers lack dynamic range. They sound muddy. I believe that the LX is a 4 speaker audio without a tweeter. The bass and mid range are also not very clean and sharp. I have tried to adjust the bass, and tweeter but the speakers stink! I love the Civic, except for the speakers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my Element for a Civic because of gas mileage. I looked at Corollas, Scions, and even a Ford Fusion.

But the interior is top notch, the steering and acceleration is responsive, the USB iPod interface is a nice touch, and the OVER 30 MPG average that I've been experiencing over the last 2000 miles has been amazing. Sure, I can't haul as much as I used to, but I never really did, and the Civic is a great car I will use for years to come.</TEXT>

After driving several makes and models, I decided to go with the Civic. I am not disappointed at all. I went with the LX-S because I liked the black interior and some of the extras it came with. The car handles great and the 4 cylinder has surprising power. The fuel economy is better than expected. 4 fill ups and I have been getting 30 + mpg with over 70% being city driving.

<TEXT>I test drove a 2008 model before the 2009, and the feel and acceleration is much smoother and noticeably more responsive in the 2009 vs. 2008. I did not want to rate reliability, as I have only had the car for a couple weeks now. But for the two weeks I will just say 10. The Civic Hybrid is rated better in crash test than the Prius, and gets comparable fuel economy. I truly believe the Honda Civic Hybrid is a far better value than any other small or mid-sized hybrid vehicle on the market.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Civic LX two weeks ago and am generally very pleased with it. BUT, I am disappointed that Honda has not entered the 21st century along with Saturn and other cars by providing remote trunk access with their Civic LX. The apparent reason: to provide a disincentive to buy the LX, and push you to buy an EX for $2000 more. So, if you have kids, if you shop and appreciate easy trunk access as you lug items to the car, buy another car. Is remote trunk access worth $2000? Not in my book. Next car will be a Toyota.</TEXT>

The fit and finish of the leather and the whole interior is top-notch, and clearly beats out the 2009 Corolla that I test drove. Both the Corolla and Civic are very close, but Honda has the edge in appearance inside and out, as well as build quality. The doors have a nice thud to it, almost like a luxury car, while the Corolla had a slight rattle every timed you closed the driver side door. It's those little things that made me give Honda my cash. Both Honda and Toyota are rated #1 and #2 in reliability so it's hard to go wrong...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove just about every competitor with the idea I did not want a Civic. After 5 weeks and numerous test drives there was only one choice; the Civic. Handling, MPG, styling and the track record of the Civic's reliability won out. The only car that came close was the Mazda 3. The LX-S comes standard with 16" alloy wheels, small spoiler and "SI like" seats. The fit and finish are excellent. I got 34.1 mpg on my first tank (2/3 highway). The car handles like a dream and the manual trans is typical Honda, smooth as silk. My Civic replaces my sporty 1994 Ford Probe (Mazda mechanicals) after 201,000 miles. Trust me, all things considered, the Civic is the best car in its class. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first Honda I have ever owned and I LOVE IT! I was driving a van and getting 22 mpg. It was costing me a bundle so after researching fuel efficient cars I decided on the Civic. It's getting 36 mpg right out of the gate! I'm thrilled with my decision and if it holds up like everyone says, then my daughter who will be driving in 5 years will be thrilled with it too. It holds my four kids comfortably and is roomy enough for my husband to drive and not feel cramped. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Best car purchase of my life x2. Had a civic back in 1995 - 2002 and loved it. I'm so glad Honda came out with the hybrid. Looks a lot better than the Prius. I already have fallen in love with this car with 40+ mpg. Living 50 miles from my job helps me to save at the pump. This was the major buying factor for me other than I have always liked Honda's products.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had a 99' Honda Civic before this - just the basic model- and it was a really reliable car, compared to an 06' liberty I drove. I've only had my 09' CIVIC for a week and I love it, I can hardly wait to drive it every day. I bought the EX-L version because I wanted all the bells and whistles, and I don't regret getting this one. It honestly drives like a BMW - loads of fun to drive, even if you are just cruising and very comfortable to ride in. I always turn heads in this car. Perfect for a college student looking for a sporty, luxury, economical, reliable car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was skeptical at first about a Civic. I previously drove a 2005 Corolla and wanted to "step up." I thought the Civic would not really be a step up. I drove many other cars from Toyota, VW and Acura first. Then I drove a Civic. Loved it. Has great steering, handling, ride and is pretty quiet. I have almost 1000 miles on my silver 09 civic ex manual and I couldn't be happier with my car or my payment. And I rest easy knowing that I'll be happy with a car that will most likely have few or no problems for many years to come. It's a great car. Go drive one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the new LX-S version. It has the seats of an Si, and the leather wrapped steering wheel that you have to get an EX to get. I would suggest this car for anyone that has a little sporty nature, but wants to keep the gas tank full. Remember, it's no V8, it is however a peppy I4 that's why I gave it the 9 on performance. The Brakes are also impressive. There are also little things that I like too. An auxiliary jack for my iPod, good cup holders, tilt/telescopic wheel, and the cool speedometer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning over a dozen American Made cars, this is my first Honda. The first thing I noticed was how "solid" the car felt. Looks like a small car on the outside, but inside it looks alot bigger than it actually is. Nice expansive interior. Layout of dash/interior very user friendly. Everything easy to reach and use. Wide front view while driving, no blind spots. Very comfortable seating & alot of room to spare & I'm 6' 1". The LX automatic is nicely equipped already. I'm adding blue interior lighting under the dash areas. Gas mileage is outstanding! 31 mpg in the city-so far. Advertised 28. If this car lives up to its past proven record while I own it, I'm buying another Honda later on!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage! Eye-Pleasing Blue Dash/Gauge lighting. CD/Radio and other standard "toys" the LX comes with. Center Armrest. The Heater warms up the interior super fast! It's just a very nice solid car that's fun to drive and with the new re-design for 2009 it looks very sporty to boot! Good Job Honda!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have the car for 7 months, for the price no other car company can match it for performance, styling, fun meter level. The Civic-EX isn't even close in matching the Si's performance... no auto tranny may be the reason for not getting Si for many buyers. About 6.6 seconds to 60 mph with a 4 cyl. engine (no turbo), and only 197 hp, 139 ft.lbs of torque! I'm getting about 25 mpg overall with about 60% city driving. You have to rev this car above 6k rpm to find its "sweet" spot. If you want less 4.0 sec to 60 mph, then buy a Vette for $80+K! One car magazine rates it #17 for the most fun to drive for ALL cars on the road (including BMW, Audi, etc.) that are priced 2x+ the Si's sticker.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Takes a while to get used to the digital speed meter (mph), but I love it compared to the OLD analog dial. Seats are much sportier than other Civic models.

<TEXT>I have owned a 2006 Honda Accord since new, and have been very pleased. Along came cash for clunkers, and I happened to have a '94 Explorer that I was ready to junk, and lo and behold, $4500 was too much to pass up for a new car. This '09 lx-s sedan is really the ticket! It's solid and responsive. The black interior is unique to other civics, and really sets it apart. Both the '06 and the '09 are white. Seems to be the best color for looking sharp and to keep clean, although I do like black. Have had the car for a couple of months, get 30 mpg average, and really like driving it. I've learned to keep my right knee away from the emergency brake handle. It bothered me at first. </TEXT>

<TEXT>First new car I've ever bought. I had driven multiple cars, and did not realize this did not have keyless entry, no arm rest, not even floor mats until I was driving it home. I was furious. I brought it back. But they wanted an additional $4000 for the keyless entry and armrest. We were hoping to get the cash for clunkers, but they decided they couldn't do it because the computer system was overloaded. Then we were supposed to get 3.9% financing, but despite our exclnt credit we didn't qualify? We were at the dealership for five hours waiting for the car to be readied. During the test drive the salesman pointed out the adjustable steering wheel, but didn't mention all it lacked. Very unhappy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is nice looking, it is comfortable and the interior is a lot of bang for the buck considering the price. However, I do feel the engine is lacking a big, at only 2,500 miles I already feel a little idle rumble when I start the car and it's not nearly as good on gas as my 99 Civic EX which I also still have. That's a big disappointment to me. The brakes also seem like they are working super hard all the time and they make an awful noise when breaking on any type of hill. I don't believe they are going to last too long. Those are my only gripes, it's a nice little car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior is roomy and comfortable. Trunk is a nice size. Love the dash and the controls for radio, etc. are easily accessible while driving. I do like the design for 2009 as well, the previous few years were a little too spaceship like for my taste.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded my 2004 Impala with 90.000 miles for the civic lx-s, with 134 miles on I had a little (or big) problem, the engine stopped responding to the accelerator, I kept on pumping the pedal and downshifting (just in case) on the way down to 1st gear and it got going again, took to the dealer and did not find any problems, I just have to learn to trust again, but, I love the sporty feel of the car as a whole, steering wheel, dash, outside, don?t care for the wheel covers (will probably fit some nice alloys). Love the happy revving engine and the Goodyears are just ok, but for what the car was design for, it is fitting. Over 300 miles now, loving it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Thank you, taxpayers; my old Mercury Villager is no more! Being a college student, I needed a more reliable form of transportation, and that's exactly what I got. I looked at a few competitors as well as the Accord, but the Civic fit what I needed best. The Si badging added a little something something to the personal enjoyment factor. So far, I love my Civic. It has been impeccable in both build quality, initial reliability, and ownership satisfaction. Having never driven manual before and it being a new car, I was expecting some low MPGs on the first tanks. However, in my 2500 miles of driving, my lowest tank has been 28 and my best slightly above 33. Keep this car on your short list!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Numerous audio inputs. Front cupholders the best I've experienced. Front seat thigh bolsters. Two tiered dash is amazing; I don't know if I could go back to a traditional format.

And guess what? They had only one that came in that morning. Loved it unconditionally until it had 134 miles on the odometer, and shut off by itself in 5th gear at 50mph, kept on downshifting trying to get going again, got going again sputtering a little and with almost 300 miles being fine so far, I just need to trust it again, but, it is a blast to drive, no complaints on the goodyears, sticky enough, clutch pedal like butter, love the steering wheel, would just love some alloy rims, but, the price was right.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is great. It is my first car and I love it. It looks great and it is actually kinda strong for a 1.8 L engine. Its better than a lot of 2.0 L engines because it preforms better on gas but has as much power as a 2.0 L engine. Its fun to drive and the speedometer is soooooo unique. Everyone that rides in my car loves it. This car is perfect for anyone who doesn't want to spend so much money on gas and perfect for someone that wants a car that's worth your money, not to mention how long this car will last. I JUST LOVE IT.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The speedometer is SO NICE, the interior is black and stylish but u may need to keep a lint roller with u but that's ok with me.

<TEXT>I've had several Accords, so I know how reliable Hondas are. I have had my Si for a year now, and it's the S2000 I didn't buy for reasons of practicality. I was 60 when I bought this sports car with a trunk and a (roomy) back seat. I love the styling, the performance, and most of all... the seats! These are the best seats I have ever had in any car; great back support, and with the red stitching and Si logo, they look way cool. I average about 25 miles per gallon in mixed driving (best was 28), not bad considering its hard to resist putting your foot down to experience the i-VTEC rush that kicks in at 6k rpm. I wish it was quieter, though. Engine noise is cool, but lots of road noise, too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats, handling, clutch action, acceleration (at higher rpms), ergonomics, styling, digital speedo. This car is a ton of fun to drive; I look forward to my two 30-minute commutes everyday. I wish it was legal (for me) to drive faster; this car loves 95 mph. Affordability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Civic Si is a terrific car if you like the sound of a boomy exhaust, sharp handling, a high revving engine, and straight line quickness "on-tap." The dual personality of this vehicle is what sets it apart from other vehicles in its class (Mazda 3 speed, GTI, Mini S etc..). If you want a high mileage economy car, you can simply shift sooner (go slower) and get very good mileage (I get 24-25 in city). If you want to have some fun, just slam the gas and let the car rev. Once you hit 5000 rpm you start to grin (it's unavoidable). Either way, this car is a lot of fun. On the other hand, if you like a soft, smooth and quiet auto, the SI is not for you.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently bough this car a month ago and already drove around 1.4K. Highway mileage is great, I got like 33 mph with air conditioner on. City mileage is not so good though, I am making only 22-23 mph. One of the reasons might be the fact that I usually have to drive in heavy traffic, go little and stop again. Road noise sometime can be a little excessive. Even a little bit of uneven road surface can cause uncomfortably loud grinding noise coming from suspension. Other than the noise problem, the car runs smooth. Always fun to drive. I even sometime intentionally miss the exit on the way to work just because I couldn't get enough of driving this car.

<TEXT>I had a 1999 Honda Accord EX 4-door that I traded in on a new 2009 Honda Civic coupe EX. Was I ever blown away by how many changes had taken place in the past decade! The premium audio system in the civic sounds like a home theater set up. The exterior stylings are crisp and flashy and give the car an aggressive look which I like. Driving around town and on the highways is a blast. At first I was worried about the little car's ability to 'get up and go' especially with the highway speeds in my area. However it's shown to be more than capable of getting up to speed and the agile handling makes weaving around traffic a breeze. Overall this is the most fun little car I've ever driven! 10/10!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car 3 months ago. I have no problem with handling, mileage, and reliability. However, I'm not satisfied with the build quality because there is vibration on the side door which I could not locate the exact place. It really bothers me because you can really hear the vibration. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Honda, and all have been amazingly reliable. Not all of them have been fun to drive, however. My new Si takes the fun level off the scale compared to most other Hondas. Are there faster cars? Yes. Are there better handling cars? Yes. Can you get any of these other cars for under $19,200? No chance. The closest car that I found would have been almost $6000 more than the Civic. It's an amazing car for the money. Be careful when reading other reviews, as most of the people driving the Civic Si are younger drivers. The one reviewer complaining about a vibration in the brakes is describing the activation of the ABS system. Without it he would have been in a skid.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power of the ridiculously high revving 2.0 liter engine. It's great in the hands of an experienced driver. 197 horsepower in a 2900 pound car makes you go REALLY fast. Can't wait for the next track day.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned 2 civics (2001 LX and 2005 SI hatchback) prior to this one. There is a reason why I purchased another new SI. Amazing comfort, style, and power all in this sporty package. If you are even debating getting an SI like myself, do yourself a favor and buy it. On my first tank of gas I got 33 MPG of 50/50 highway/city driving(ratings are 21/29 on the sticker). If you are looking for a car that turns heads then this is the one for you. So far my wife and I have put 1500 miles on it and have loved every minute of driving it. I strongly suggest you get a test drive at your local dealer so you can see for yourself why Honda's slogan is "Above all else." </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>There is so much to love in this car but my favorite feature has to be the exhaust and horsepower. This car sounds like my (Honda)sportbike and has a nice throw back when you punch it. I also love the stereo. It has a nice kick to it but, it's not over done and annoying like some cars are.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought it one month ago, and it's everything I was looking for in a new car. Great handling and fun to drive. Ultra cold air conditioning, very quiet engine, smoooooth transmission, excellent turning, aesthetically pleasing interior, stops on a dime. After purchasing the car, made the mistake of driving a friend's 2009 Civic EX-L. Although my cloth seats are very comfortable, the leather seats are even more comfortable, and they dress up the car's interior quite nicely. For the few extra dollars, would go for the EX-L if I could do it all over again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Decided to buy a Civic for my first new car. I have had it for 1 week/150 miles. Seriously considered Toyota Yaris/ VW Rabbit. Yaris was not as solid (felt shaky when compared to Civic) and VW has a reputation for being unreliable. You cannot go wrong with Honda-they are truly built to last. My Civic is not even half empty and the mileage is ~150 (and I've been driving in city traffic, stop/go). The AC is amazing. The lowest setting keeps me cool in the summer heat of Tucson. The sound system is excellent (would like a little bit more bass!, the interior is very comfortable, and the engine has alot of pep. Of course, I'm still breaking it in so I'm taking it easy on the acceleration. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the car almost one month ago. I have driven through almost all the East Coast from New Hampshire to Florida and made 3700 miles. My first impression is that it is exciting to drive it no matter how long you are driving without a stop. The power&fuel economy balance is excellent in my opinion. Interior design is cheerful and quite ergonomic. I found this car quite comfortable on both highway and city roads except the seats. You slip in a while and need to reposition yourself. Also you need to be careful on blind spots due to unusual windshield design which on the other hand completes the sleek exterior look of the car. Fortunately I have no technical problems so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Actually I leased the car for one reason, fuel cost. I do have a 4x4 truck for bad weather etc. The car is what I expected, good fuel economy (44 mpg avg.) It does lack power of course, but back in the 80's I had a VW Rabbit Diesel, this car far exceeds the VW. I have the car for 3 months and in all fairness I made the right move. Finally took it on a trip, you better stretch out every 2 or 3 hours, or your back will be hurting. The seat feel comfortable, but you sit too low and they are not very comfortable in the long haul. Drove it on I-84 up and down grades with the a/c on, it did bog down at 65 MPH but you can get used to that. Did almost 50 mpg , very pleased.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Dealer said they had customers getting 45-49mpg. I have had the car for 2 months and have 9k miles already. Solid avg, mpg of 47! Drive posted speed of 75mph+ do not hyper- mile. 95 mile commute 1 way, mountains, hwy, etc. First service is $85.00 which I thought was kind of high. But looks like every 9k service so not to bad. I have friends who have Prius' and don't get same mpg as I do. Tire noise is excessive, can overcome with MP3's. Navi is 1st class! Car Drives good in rain and at highway speeds, hopefully all will continue in the winter! Very pleasantly surprised of mpg claims from dealer were not exaggerated.

<TEXT>I have the car now for 3 months, fuel economy exceeds the sticker rating. On the down side you have to be careful when stopping, at low speeds it surges and I would find it difficult to park in a tight spot. I finally got to go on a trip, I- 84 with its ups and downs, the gas engine strains trying to do 65 up some of the hills, it's no power house. And my back was sore after a 300 mile trip, gosh when I go to FL in fall I will need dr to work on my back, I guess it's a car for the younger set, I am 63 and went from a CRV to this. On the plus side it uses half the gas the CRV did. It's too bad Honda can't find a better place for the batteries, I miss the fold down back seats. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned a 2000 civic before this one and also an accord 2008 right now. This car is smaller than the Accord, but the quality is no less. This car is a great little 4 cylinder, very easy on gas, very quiet high quality Honda engine and nice handling. As I said on my accord review, I have own them all dodge, ford, chevy, toyota and Hyundai and where the Honda leaves the rest behind is time. After 3 or 4 years, the Honda still feels and runs like the day you purchased it. The others slowly show their age with squeaks, garage visits and part replacements. If you want a little car, easy on gas, top notch quality that will be trouble free for many years to come and hold its value - this is it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the car two weeks and have had no problems with it other than adjusting to automatic transmission from manual and the automatic windows and door locks. It is very easy to handle and takes corners smoothly. It drives like an automatic so I can hear when the engine wants to shift and since I'm used to manual, I would shift it at a few different RPMs but I am getting used to it. I rated it low as fun to drive because manual transmission is more fun to drive. The dealer didn't have any manuals so I thought I would try automatic. If you are really set on manual I would hold out for it as automatic is not the same thing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The air-conditioner has a MAX setting which is great for very hot climates and days. The speedometer is digital which my son likes because he can see it from the back seat.

<TEXT>I read a lot about this car prior to purchase and concluded it was a great idea. It was hard to find one--called around a lot and the few places that had them in the country wanted top dollar. Eventually found one out of state and purchased end of month--got a reasonable deal. It is an awesome commuter car--very cheap to run, extremely reliable, clean burning, carpool lane exemption, and dare I say, even fun to drive. No, certainly not a sports car, but it corners well, stops well, and accelerates decently. CNG is well below the price of regular unleaded-- about 40-50% for me, and I'm not Utah--I'm surprised everyone there doesn't have one! My kids, boss and others say "cool!"</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded down from a 2004 Accord for better mileage so there was a bit of an adjustment there. Seemed very underpowered compared to 2.4 L in the Accord. But for the money, it's really hard to beat this car. Like all Hondas, fit and finish is very good. A bit more hard plastic inside than I would like (suffers compared to the Accord) but I like the dash design much better. Arrangement of radio and climate controls nicely done and very ergonomic. Handling is excellent, on par with the Accord, despite the lack of double wishbone. Seats are not nearly as good as the Accord's but still not bad. Mileage has been as rated. Noisier than I would like. Overall A- or B+.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I will have about 200K on this car in 4 years...have driven 30K so far and there are no issues what so ever. I get 38-41MPG combined (improved from 35 when purchased). The car handles well and is very comfortable with the exception of the location of the E- brake. Be very careful...this bothers me personally on long trips. No issues whatsoever at 30K. The Goodyears are crappy and wearing down. The stereo has one speaker that vibrates (I don't care). System sounds decent enough. I can plug in my ipod, love that. Stick shift is smooth and very sweet with adequate power. This car has been exactly as desired so far. I expect the build quality to stand above most other brands. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I previously owned a 1.8 Turbo Volkswagen Jetta that had some serious pep for a 4cyl engine. However, the thing was falling apart and overall my experience was poor. I was drawn to the Civic because of its reputation for reliability, fuel economy, and its nice design. After nearly 3,000 miles on the car, I'm happy with my purchase. It's not as much fun to drive as the Jetta, but the 5 speed manual offers some excitement and better all-around control over the car. I ended up going with the EX-L because on the 2009's it's the only version that offers stability control (VSA). Also, it's worth noting that I'm relatively tall (6'4"), and I fit very comfortably in the driver's seat.</TEXT>

I've taken it on two trips and had plenty of trunk room for 3. Car handled well on highway beside big rigs as well as city driving. I wish it had better hwy noise insulation. Also wish the seats were not quite so hard and had lumbar support but because I like everything else, I can live with it. Got a great deal on the car in mid June which makes me like it even more! I plan to keep it until it dies. Three out of four sons have Hondas and all have high miles and are doing great. Sweet husband volunteered to drive the old family van.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall I'm very pleased with the Civic. Fuel economy has exceeded my expectations, and the car is very nimble and fun to drive with the manual. The seats are also very comfortable, and there's plenty of room for me (5'11") even with the seat raised to its highest position. I would have rated it with 10's across the board if it weren't for a few things: 1) Either drive-by-wire or the VTEC mechanism makes acceleration under certain conditions somewhat choppy and abrupt. 2) There's a creaking noise coming from the front suspension, and a rattle coming from the rear of the car. I can't determine the source of either. 3) Thin paint. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The stock EX coupe radio is amazing. One of the best stock systems I've heard. It trumps that of a relative's Acura MDX, and the Bose system in the GMC Yukon Denali.

<TEXT>Reliable and sporty (I have the coupe). Very well designed and quite a looker. It's fun to drive granted it's no civic Si but it is quick and agile. I decided to go with the EX Coupe because the Si's have shifter and clutch problems. The sound system is 350 Watts and has a subwoofer. This comes in the Coupe EX and the Si's only. Very happy with the bass response from it. Nice Standard Alloy Rims. Shifts are crisp and smooth. I would definitely purchase this car again. Very complacent ride that does a great job around the corners and is comfortable on rough roads. My only minor complaint is something that plagues Hondas and that is the road noise. It's not awful but could be better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car has dropped in mileage. A new set of tires in the rear every 5 thousand miles. I've had to have 3 sets of tires put on the car. Sometimes the car will jump if you want to go ahead very carefully. You need to keep your foot on the brake in close quarters. American Honda will not recognize the tire problem and will do nothing about it, so only buy one if you want to put new tires on constantly, which is more expensive and bad for the environment.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have only owned Hondas for the past 12 years because we don't want the hassle, headache and maintenance woes associated with other vehicles. Honda has not disappointed. We recently purchased the new 2009 Civic LX-S to replace our 1997 Civic as a work/commuter car. In reading other reviews, I am surprised to see complaints like "no lighted vanity mirrors," "no keyless entry for the trunk," etc. Are we missing the boat here? This is excellent for what it is, an economy car. If you want a car for under $19,000 with reliability, great fuel economy, look no further. If you want heated seats with your keyless entry, buy something else and stop complaining. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I selected the LX-S based on the options that comes standard on it as opposed to the LX and even some options not on the EX (leather-wrapped steering wheel). I wanted a spoiler, alloy wheels, leather-wrapped steering wheel and Automatic Transmission in a 4 door. The LX-S was tailor made for me. I originally was looking at a Fit based on price, but the LX-S was quoted lower than the Fit. I couldn't believe it. Several hundred below Edmunds TMV. Car feels very solid. Not very powerful, but I'm looking for fuel economy and couldn't care less about power. Backseat is large enough for my 2 car seats. Trunk is adequate. Based on price + mpg + reliability I'm looking forward to racking up the miles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sporty, yet sophisticated body style with alloy wheels and spoiler. The interior material does collect lint, but looks and feels great.

<TEXT>It's Honda reliability and there is no disputing that. But in reality, the car is overrated. The car rides very rough and road noise is horrible. No vanity lights is an oversight on Honda's part. The car handles good but is lacking in some basic features like: vanity lights, power seats, in- dash 6 disc changer, and homelink. It has good power unless you're merging into traffic and need to get out there (you may be in trouble). When you compare the Civic, Corolla, & Mazda3, dollar for dollar and feature for feature I think Honda ends up in last place. I think they are relying too much on a legacy and have become too complacent. Would not have another one that's for sure. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Love my car. It does have some issues, however. Unfortunately the real power is mostly limited to the v-tech 6000- 8000rpm range, which goes by very quickly. Steering wheel feels cheap, small, light. Feedback through steering wheel is subpar, brakes need tuning when used on uneven surfaces, handling is subpar on uneven surfaces and sudden changes in direction at high speeds - it feels as if the car is swaying in corners. Lint/dirt sticks to suede seats, but they are comfortable. Excellent gearbox, stereo system. Plastic on doors, center console is not put together well - feels cheap. Gas mileage is not too great considering the high octane fuel that is required and the low power(0-60 is slow).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cup holders, stereo system. MPH, RPM readout is nice. Styling is great. Reliability of a Honda. Good transmission. The four door is wonderful - a fun to drive, useful compact with large trunk space. Side support of seats. V-tech is fun, though the engine goes through the 6k-8k range very quickly.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Gave up my Acura TL after 7 great years. Was a little worried about "trading down" to Honda, but I couldn't be happier. Was looking for a commuter car, & this definitely fits the bill. It's very well built, nice interior, and easily fits 4 people (5 might be cozy, we haven't tried it yet). While not the most powerful car, it delivers what it needs to in most situations. It's quite loud around 3- 4K RPM (going up steep hills). But by far the best feature - 42MPG, as advertised. Got 51MPG today on a 74 mile drive. I don't mind sitting at stop lights as much anymore, since the car shuts off. It does lack in some "luxury" things (push button start, HID, etc), but for 22K, can't complain. Great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been a Toyota fan for a while, but when I was in the market for a coupe, I was not impressed with Toyota (scion). Everything I wanted was an upgrade on the scion and by the time I got what I wanted, the civic had it, (and then some) at a better price then the scion. I am very happy with the civic. I traded in my corolla for the civic. My wife drives a 2004 acura TL and she always asks me to trade with her, I tell her no, it's mine!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Interior features are a lot like the TL. All the extra's (usb port, aux. port, comp. port, etc.). The Style!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving the Chevy Cobalt, Corolla and Aveo I tried this car and there is no comparison hands down, the Civic won me over. I have had no problems at all. Very little road noise. This car is sharp inside and out and excellent on gas. Very solid and stable performance. I'm looking for reasons to drive it. This is my first non GM car and now I see why GM is slipping. Only Honda for me from now on. The A/c will freeze you out!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The two tier instrument panel. The comfort of the seats and I'm over 6 foot tall. The location of controls. The radio is awesome. Excellent A/C. Solid ride. Fast steering response. The armrest. The cloth seats are nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am very pleased with my Honda Civic Hybrid it is better than I had hoped for. I purchased this vehicle to commute in Los Angeles traffic and it performs great - the comfort level is very good. I have been driving about 43 years and would recommend this vehicle to everyone who needs a great car at a very good price. I am considering purchasing a second one for my daughter.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I average about 30.5 mpg with a heavy foot in hwy and city driving. This car meets all my needs and I love my dealer added XM radio w/the display. This baby keeps up with the fast cars. A quiet ride and stylish- I like the fact that Honda re-added the silver strip to the back of the car like the old Civics had. I love Hondas and would re-purchase this one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2009 Honda Civic Si Coupe is a real bargain for an under $25,000 car. I never tire from driving it. The seats are pleasing to look at; however, I sometimes have a difficult time finding a comfortable seating position. Below 5,800 rpms there is not much power. I usually reach i-VTEC in first and second gear, but that is usually it unless I want to obtain a speeding ticket. On the streets I have only been able to redline the car in first gear because it already brings me to 55 mph. Honda should increase the power, so it can be accessible earlier. The transmission is smooth, and I am able to shift the gears effortlessly although fifth and sixth gears are mostly useless.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Honda Civic is a great car to drive. It handles well and it is fun to drive. The air conditioning on warm days takes a little while to get cool. Have not experienced the mileage that Honda claims the car gets. The Ipod connection is great. I am experiencing a noise that is coming from the passenger side dashboard that I cannot locate. Taking back to Honda to see what their service people tell me. Once this issue is corrected I would recommend this car to anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Nice looking car, like the led tail lights and digital dash, but I'm 5'6 and smash my shin each and every time I enter this car. Poor design there, seats could be more comfortable, lots of rattles and squeaks and idles rough at red lights. I have the basic VP model, and although it features power windows, there are manual locks and mirrors! This was almost $19k at my dealer. I wish I had done more research on other cars before leasing this. It's really not worth the $$ at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 6th Honda, first Hybrid. So naturally I like Honda's. I was surprised by the power, not like the original VW diesel of yesteryear. Car is fun to drive, but watch out don't get caught and wrapped up looking at the dashboard constantly showing data or you will be in an accident. I only have it for a couple weeks but the MPG is as good or better than the sticker rating. Usual Honda quality, not a thing wrong so far, there is no laundry list for the dealer to repair when first service come around. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Considering it is a brand new car, it is extremely noisy as if the windows are not completely closed. It has a very low clearance that makes you feel you are sitting on the floor and you hear and feel every grain of sand that hits the bottom of the car. The steering wheel is very small, especially for a petite person. When it is windy, I feel like I don't have a good control of the car because I cannot rest my left arm on the door as I was used to doing with my previous cars. It does not show the outside temperature. I think this feature should be mandatory for every car that is made. My husband convinced me to buy it and I regret it very much. That was my worst purchase ever. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I only have the car for a week, this is my sixth Honda, first Hybrid. The car has ample acceleration and power, very quiet ride. Face it with the unstable oil market, it's time to make the change. I only leased the car for three years, who knows what type of power will be available in the future. I don't think the extra cost will pay for itself in three years, but I leased it to save gas, not money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drivers seat adjustments to higher and lower, I tried the Pirus. The Civic has more comfort. I did get around 46 mpg with first fill up, very pleased.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my 2009 LX 4DR in October 2008 and have been very pleased with the car's performance and economical aspects. However, at 9,800 miles the front wheels began making squeaking sounds, rolling forward or back, whether or not the brakes were applied. When I took the car to the dealer, the service writer said the brakes were WORN OUT. Those squeaking noises are the brake sensors indicating a need for brake pad change. Now, I've owned many new cars in my life but I can't recall EVER having to change disc brake pads at 9,800 miles. Brakes are not covered under warranty, so I paid $269 for new brakes. Where is the low cost of ownership Honda claims? Honda Customer Service was no help.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle replaces a 2000 Honda Accord I owned. I have been very happy with my previous car and having driven 6,000 miles with this current vehicle, I am very happy I purchased it. Though, small, the Civic feels very roomy and spacious for its size. The gauge layout is interesting, but has become very beneficial for me. The voice activated navigation is a great feature and being able to connect my phone for the hands free link is perfect for me. I am happy I stayed with Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>All I hear about is Honda quality and reliability. So I decide to pick up a Civic for the supposed worry free experience. First night I get the car, I hear a squeaking sound from the driver side front wheel area on any road imperfection. Take it for service, and I am told they had to inject foam into an area between two body panels that were rubbing against each other. Pick it up the next day, and notice a rattling sound from the rear while turning on way home from dealer. Take it back to test drive with master tech. While doing so with tech, I lower window, and hear a squeaking sound. Tech laughs, I curse. All of this before 90 miles on car. First and last Honda. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Car so far has been pretty awesome. Vehicle drives smoothly and I receive many compliments. I have to say overall I am very satisfied with the car. It has hot heat and cold a/c. Test drove many other cars for many months and feel in love with this one. Really love the placement on the digital speedometer. Has a pretty decent sounds system, get about 37 mpg on the highway and 23 in the city. </TEXT>
