<TEXT>It's an otherwise GREAT car but have had a dead battery 2-times!!! Serviced at Steinle GM in Fremont, OH but they can't fix it either because they dont care or dont know how. It has run down protection so the battery should never go dead. They just say "there's nothing we can do".</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Has special paint & interior. Very sharp car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car with a combination of rebates (regular & 'owner loyalty') plus GM doubled my GM Card fun bucks. Bottom line: I got a car with an 19K MSRP for 12K before taxes. I find the interior to be functional an it looks ok. The exterior is plagued with poor fitting body panels, poor even by American standards. Acceleration is adequate with the 5 speed manual. Handling is ok, much better than the 2002 Toyota Corolla it replaced. Rear visbility is abysmal and I almost didn't buy it because of that, but the bottom line was that it was very well equipped for what I paid. Its a commuter car that will eventually be handed down to the kid.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For a 19yo 6ft 210lb person i found the car very comfortable. I love the styling and it looks fantastic when cared for. I did find the e-brake under the armrest odd, however not really a problem. I drive very aggressively and still get great gas mileage. Coming from my previous vehicle (2003 Aztek) it is extremely fun to drive. It preforms pretty well, however dogs slightly until you get to 40+ mph. This can be alleviated with affordable after-market parts such as performance exhaust and intake.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I would not have bought this tiny car, except for the $4,500 federal rebate. The gas mileage is incredible. The speed sensitive electrical power steering is just ok. Cornering is ok. I think it should have better front brakes, given the weight ratio. Attn. Gm: this is a coupe. Do you understand? am I getting through? it's a coupe; a coupe. Make it comfortable for two people. Jump seats would be fine in back. And the parking brake nestled under the armrest is just plain stupid.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very affordable vehicle with rebates and browny points. A great commuter car when you consider the competition is more money for not a whole lot more car. Could have a better interior, but I new what I was getting when I got it. I like the engine very quite.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Indiana G5 Owner</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Just purchased new 2009 G5 with automatic transmission, which was priced $4k lower than similar equiped 2009 Honda Civic. Consumer Reports rated the G5 reliability equal to the Honda Civic except for "body integrity and/or finish" and has a better reliability rating than most American built cars. Also has a better factory warranty than Honda or Toyota. Although time will tell if this G5 will be as reliable as my other car; i.e. Honda. So far, enjoying the creature comforts, sound system and the "GREAT" gas mileage - 39+ mpg! I'm happy the car received so-so ratings, keeps the price down and affortable in these tough times.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Body Styling and matching interior, the car gets lots of looks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far perfect. I have a 180 mile round trip commute,at 3 AM onstar is comforting. The car gets great mileage,very comfortable,xm radio in the lonely areas,fun to drive. For a commuter that gets 37mpg the overall performance is outstanding. Base level G5 xfe, 5 Speed about 17K, -4,500 cash for clunkers, 3,500 incentives, 500ish dealer discount +tt&l, came to 10,700 whats not to love. I got way more than I paid for. 11 bucks a month extended the bumper to bumper to 100,000 miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for about a month. I love the so-so reviews on this. It keeps demand low and prices. I'm very familar with the 2.2 - same engine I had in my '04 Grand Am and loved it. No problems great mileage - good power too. This time I went for MPG with the XFE and the 5 speed. Without any effort I got 35mpg on my first tank of combind city and highway. It's just a good commuter car. Not a sports car (I have the Miata for that) and not a lux car. With incentive and rebates about 5k lower in price than comparably equiped Honda and Toyota. AS far as resale - drive it. The sale of Grand Am brought half of what I paid with 75k on the clock - not bad for having the better half of its life..</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Satellite raido is nice. All power options as standard a plus. The comuter display is great - I love the instant MPG display. I have a friend that bought the Scan Gauge for $300 that does what this does for free and looks right at home doing it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At first i was a little skeptical as anyone purchasing a new vehicle are. I am 6'4 250 LBS and I find it has more room than most other cars i have driven. The seat has the ability to move back far enough for even me. I was surprised that the actual fuel milage was up near 30 mpg even with someone like me (19 years old) driving it. I love the Intermediate feature even though I really wanted the 5 speed, it is nice to just shift down to that to slow down, very good feature that I have never seen before. The biggest downfall for me, the AC Outlet is placed under the armrest which annoys me. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features would have to be the intermediate shift feature on the automatics, and the outside of the car is very appealing to me compared to the Chevy Cobalt.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased the GT 2009, it's a fun car to drive, lots of leg room in front, and if there isn?t enough leg room in the back for other people, then they can take the bus, or consider themselves lucky to get a free ride. I used to drive the Saturn 2006 Ion Red Line with 205 Hp, the GT only has 155 Hp, there is a difference in power but I noticed a bigger difference in gas prices when I fell up at the pumps. In the standard 5 speed model, in 5th gear, the engine rev's very low which helps in reduced engine noise. For the appearance inside, I like it, everything is in front of you, seats are firm, armrest with storage. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great low fuel consumption, smooth ride and pretty quiet inside, great radio 260 watts</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love the yellow, Im 6ft 1, 280 lbs and this car fits great. its fun to drive, not what I expected a commuter to be. Controls easy to use, radio good, ride good, road noise very low, build quality good. dont like the light material on the seats and doors, should have bought darker. just hope I can keep my lic. My Son wants this car, wants to dump his old civic.. so why do the car critics trash this car?? I would buy another one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Do not buy a Pontiac G5 or Chev. Cobalt. If you could buy one for half the MSRP maybe otherwise look else where. Seats very uncomfortable. Gas mileage not that good for a small 4 cyl. Mine did not even come with a spare tire or jack. It is not only plastic, but cheap plastic. And I am sure resale will be horrible. Do not learn the hard way like I have. I LOVE AMERICA, but not their small cars.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Needed a new vehicle to use primarily to run around town that would be economical. Noticed the G5 on Pontiac web site. Sticker on vehicle we purchased was over $22500, but GM knocked off $2500 from the start, plus another $2500. off with incentives. The vehicle is a silver GT model which is well loaded (XM radio, remote start, sunroof, automatic, etc.) It rides nice, handles well on 17" rims and is comfortable. It is small interior wise, but we knew that going in. It seems well-built and the whole family is well pleased with it. It may not have a "pure-bred" pedigree since it's basically a Cobalt, but it is much nicer than we'd anticipated! We are glad we gave it a look.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Remote start (for the presently bitter January here in the NE US.) 7 Pioneer speaker audio system with XM radio. Sharp looks - silver metallic with 17" aluminum rims! All in all - a sharp little car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I finally bought this car after reading reviews and staring at pictures of it over a course of 2 years and it's precisely the car I wanted. Coming from a 2003 basic model of a Saturn Ion it's a huge upgrade and great for someone my age (22).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything about the car with the "My Link" and "Sun and Sound" packages makes me happy. It's a really comfortable car that I enjoy to drive. I'm constantly looking for excuses to go places in it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just got my Pontiac G5. When I test drove it, I should have listened to my legs! I'm a 5'11 woman, and I can't wear heels when driving because of the lack of leg room. I have to push the seat all the way back. But the car is a lot of fun to drive, the gas mileage is incredible. A great buy if you're a shorter person. The interior is a little cramped, and there isn't much room to put anything, but once you get used to it, it's not that bad.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The spoiler comes standard. Ipod jack. The looks of the car. Gas mileage. The smoothness of the ride.</FAVORITE>
