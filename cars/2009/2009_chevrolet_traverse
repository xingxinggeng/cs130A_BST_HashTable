<TEXT>We've had the Traverse about 5 months now and 5000 miles. No problems to date (hasn't been back to the dealer) and both my wife and I really like the car. I see a lot of posts about poor mileage but we have consistently got 20 to 22 mpg in mixed suburban driving which in my estimation is great for such a large car. My only regret is that I did not buy an LT2 or LTZ package to get some of he features like backup camera, power folding mirrors, temperature controlled climate controls, and upgraded radio. People who ride in the car are surprized how quiet it is especially the engine (hard to tell it's running). I don't think Chevy has gotten the credit it deserves for this engine.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I guess it's not a feature but I like the drivetrain, quiet, powerful, economical and so far extremely reliable. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When driving my Traverse LTZ from home to the baseball field, low milage, slow acceleration, slow downshift, poor rear window visibility are very disappointing BUT when the 6 passenger seats are full with my kids, their friends and their sport gadgets, the cargo area is loaded with their NY Yankees jackets, coolers, one bike, bats, gloves and balls and cup holders are all booked then I realize that I did not make a mistake. Driving back home turns into a joyful experience. I appreciate the stability, smooth and comfortable ride, nice interior design, amenities the vehicle has to offer, room and the feeling of driving a safe vehicle for my family (and their friends). </TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded in an '06 Cadillac DTS; this rides every bit as smooth. Retired, but wanted the room to haul things - it's sort of our "car/truck". Lots of cargo space. Love the Bose sound system, great bass! Remote rear hatch is convenient & the fact we can change it to manual which allows us to open in the garage. The head rests were uncomfortable but just turned them around and they're fine. Cup holders are nice size; storage areas are adequate. Fuel economy is good considering my DH doesn't do gradual stops and tends to lead foot on take off; even then we're getting avg. 20 mpg city/hwy. A 75 mi. trip of 60 & 75 mph combined, averaged 26mpg. and a 158 mi hilly day trip-avg'd 22 mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cargo space; Quiet and excellent handling; smooth ride. Back-up sensors & camera. Bose sound system; Blind spot mirrors; Appealing design.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Very impressed with this vehicle. Still own a 1998 Malibu and traded in our 2002 Venture. If I could only own 1 vehicle, this would be it. It does it all - it really shines on the highway. Good riding height and has a substantial presence on the road which helps with the big truck traffic. Around town is is very nimble and my average fuel economy is 20.1 at the moment which I think is pretty good for a 4700 pound 281 HP vehicle. The exterior styling is really one of the coolest crossovers made. I get a lot of comments about it and it makes most other vehicles look like antiques. Overall, very pleased with this purchase and hope to keep it for a long long time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride, power, and safety features. Superb Bose sound system. 18" wheels with 6 lugs. Premium cloth seats is more comfortable than leather for me.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After owning only Honda/Toyota/Nissan in the past, I finally bought it because the 3rd row has easiest access of all SUV's with 3rd row we saw. It just seems American cars don't put the effort into designing things like foreign. Ran out of space for dislikes below: - Hood release lines up vertically with parking break (I've unlatched it couple times) -suv sways (hard to describe) on roads that are banked -2nd row seating tracks are exposed, food, debris can fall in the track -clothe hangers line up with back of 2nd row, clothe can't hang right -suv refuses to downshift. you have to give it a lot of gas before it gets it. -only 1 lever for wipers/turn/beams/etc (continued below)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>-i do hand it to American cars, they look nicer than ever, yet still unoriginal -I like the external design -drives like a car (wife loves it), doesn't feel as big as it really is -access to 3rd row - the best! -auto dim rear view + rear camera -strong AC (we live in FL)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I currently have 10,500 miles on my Traverse and I'm pretty happy with the comfort, performance and gas mileage the car has been getting. I drove a Tahoe before this and it's just as roomy and it gets better mileage. It's my first AWD car and I notice slipping when turning corners and rollback on inclines. Wondering if this is normal? </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our traverse in June2009. The headrests are very uncomfortable and force a short person to keep their head bowed if they don't put a pillow behind their back. My husband has nearly wrecked it three times when trying to make a left hand turn due to the poor visibility when looking to the right to see if another vehicle is coming. It is hard to park because you cannot see the front end and it's very hard to back up due to the small window and the many blind spots along the sides (we have the economy model). The gas mileage is awful. We took a long trip and the highway mpg never got above 18 mpg. My biggest concern is safety. It is an accident waiting to happen.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Since I have purchased foreign made cars over the past few years I was hesitant of getting back into the market for a domestic made automobile. We have been very happy with this vehicle. Gas mileage was a little disappointing at first but with mileage on car the mpg has improved to at least what the advertisement claims and at times a little better. I will gladly take a bit of inconvenience with the transmission shifting or not shifting especially for the mpg's.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Back up senors and back up mirror. Outside mirrors with anti-blind spots. Ride is great and room for all of the grandkids. Love the design. Great for hauling things with the seats folded down.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned my 2009 Traverse LTZ since Feb. 2009. I love everything about it, except one thing. The bad news is that one thing was the primary reason I bought the vehicle. The Traverse is advertised as getting 18mpg in the city and 24mpg on the highway. I am getting nowhere near that. My combined mpg has been 17.4mpg with roughly 50-50 city/highway mix. This is AFTER driving like I am 80 years old. I have never owned a vehicle so far below EPA mileage estimates. This is ridiculous. Otherwise, an outstanding vehicle. I am getting 19to20 mpg on the highway and 15to16 mpg in the city.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Should have stayed Ford, decided to try Chevy, very disappointed with the performance and reliability. The Check engine light has come on over 7 times in less than 6 months, first few times they said the gas cap was not put on properly. Over 35 yrs of driving time, I know how to put a gas cap on. The 4th time a fuel injector was replaced, the 5th time back to Gas cap, 6th time they replaced a coil and spark plugs, 7th time yep you guessed it, Gas Cap. We like this vehicle, we are not happy with the performance, we got a lemon, working with GM to get it replaced. I know "Good Luck". GM had their chance, going back to Ford especially if they give me my money. Should've have stayed FORD. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased the 09 Traverse LTZ after comparing GMC, Buick to other brands. Traverse seems to be the best value of the group. I can't wait to drive it on longer trips to experience all the features it has to offer. Comfort is much like sitting in a minivan so that you are not tired when you finish a trip. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This fun-to-drive crossover has it all for a small family that will expand! Captain's chairs in second row perfect for a child seat, third row perfect for driving family around with your kids! Drives like a car with great acceleration for a heavy vehicle. All you would need with a family in back. Punch it and there's a bit of torque- steer. Not recommended with family in car! Bose stereo is great and all controls easy to navigate. Remote rear hatch very helpful and very good storage with third-row seats down. With a full car, good idea to purchase storage container for top of vehicle or extra storage on the hitch. Overall very satisfied with vehicle's mpg, 18 city, 25 hwy. Rview camera a +.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I didn't think an American-made car could feel so luxurious. The interior is spacious and very comfortable with lots of leg room, even in the third row seating area. I love all of the storage compartments in the front driver's area too. The seats fold and move very easily to make more space for hauling when necessary. The back- up sensors and camera are great. My biggest complaint is the size of the buttons for turning A/C on or off, front or rear defrost on/off, etc. There's a cluster of 8 buttons and if you don't know just where the button is you're going for, it's a bit confusing and takes your attention from the road for a moment. Overall, fun to drive and I'm enjoying it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've had our Traverse for over two weeks and it certainly shows the quality that American car manufacturers can showcase once again. We purchased a loaded 2LT and the ride quality is outstanding. The cabin is incredibly quiet, even with the sunroof opened. Our other vehicle is a 2007 PT Cruiser and the Traverse is doing nearly the same gas mileage of that small car! We're averaging 18.6 MPG with a heavy amount of in-town driving. When calculating the mileage with all the horsepower the Traverse has, I can see that if you are quick to take off at a green light, you can easily lower your MPG greatly. For the size of the vehicle, the fuel economy is good. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>10 Speaker Bose System (Outstanding bass) - Ver comfortable leather seats - Seats fold down for a very large amount of cargo space akin to a truck bed - Nearly soundproof cabin - Dual sunroofs - Great horsepower</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this SUV over a Toyota Highlander because I could negotiate a better price & I had $3500 worth of GM card points to further reduce the price. I also favored this vehicle over the Highlander because (1) it seats 8, not 7; (2) it has greater cargo room, ESPECIALLY when the rear seat is up; and (3) the seats split 60/40 so that one can go on vacation, comfortably seat 5, & still have room for luggage. As an owner, I have my concerns & disappointments. One of them is MPG consistently around 15.5 mpg. My wife's Sienna van gets 20 mpg under same conditions. You need to evaluate for yourself these "awkward features" ( 1) headrests; (2)seat comfort & adjust ability; (3) rear visibility.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Split-row seats; easy access to third row; adequate cargo space in rear with third row seat up. On-Star is really cool and XM radio rocks ... but remember you are buying a vehicle and those are services taht require continual (paid) subscriptions.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had been a Minivan Mom for 7 years. I have three kids and each with two sports/activities. Loved my minivan but wanted something different. I looked at the Mazda Cx-9, Toyota Highlander, and the Honda Pilot. NOTHING compared with the Traverse!! It fits eight passengers with comfort, It is easy to drive (although I was somewhat intimidated at first), and handles like a car and much better than my Minivan. Attn: Soccer Moms out there looking to move into a Crossover. This is the SUV. Kids love it. PS I saved money by getting the LT1 model and had the dealership wrap the seats in leather and install the DVD. Came out beautiful!!!!</TEXT>

It looks like a crossover, handles like a SUV but has the features of a minivan. The room and captains chairs are great for the younder kids, the oldest loves having the rear seat to herself. My wife and I have room in front and it is a safe handling vehicle as well. Very good work went into this vehicle to meet the needs of the family of today. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my 07 Yukon Toy hauler and gas guzzler for this surprisingly fuel efficient roomy toy hauler. I have been very happy so far with the performance, handling and towing capacity. It is almost as roomy as the Yukon was inside from a driving and cargo perspective. All this with a 5-6 mile per gallon improvement. I am a big person,so I needed the leg room and seat support and the traverse has met this demand rather easily. So far, big thumbs up.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cooled seats are super. Rear view camera. Agility. Gas mileage improvement. Easy in and out compared to the Yukon. No more dirt on the back of my pants from the running boards.

<TEXT>Front headrests are VERY uncomfortable. The 2nd row (bench seating) can be moved forward and back, we thought this was great until we realized the the track it runs on creates a little crevice on the floor. We've lost kids DS games in there not to mention the "stuff" that is getting stuck in there. Also when moving the seat to get to third row, it crushes the mat on the floor, it does not accommodate for that - bad design. The car drives great on the highway but does not shift down very smoothly making city driving a little jerky. We almost bought the Ford Flex and are having buyer's remorse. Traverse still kinda looks like our old van on the outside.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Back up camera! LOVE it! Also has lots of good front storage! Very quiet on highway. Plus love the "toys" - XM radio, GPS, DVD player - but you can get this on any car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Vehicles is easy and fun to drive. Easy to park and get in and out of. I only wish I had listened to some other reviews on the bad gas mileage. I was expecting to get at least 15 miles a gallon since it is rated to get 17 in the city. But I am so dissapointed I that I get 12-13 mpg in the city. I see others say that they get great gas mileage, and others say they are getting very bad mileage like me. So maybe I got stuck with one of the bad ones: (</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our Chevy Traverse LTZ on January 2, 2009. We bought this because it was very similar to our Cadillac SRX which was also fully loaded (and it actually has a real 3rd row!). We did some research and found that the safety rating was perfect and the airbag system was top of the line. We wanted this to be our family vehicle. However, within two weeks of our purchase we made a cross country trip to Chicago for a family members funeral (I don't fly and always drive.) That's when I first notice our "CHECK AIRBAG SYSTEM" warning light came on. Well, to make a long story short. This problem has happened 5 times and they have made repair attempts and the problem still occurs. (See Below).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this to replace hubby's 10-year old Chrysler Sebring convertible. Hubby is 6'4" & fits well in the car. He loves everything about it. I am a bit pickier. Overall, it drives well, is mostly comfy (front head rests annoying), & has great storage for our 2 small kids w/car seats & a stroller in back. I drive a 2004 Toyota RAV4 (base model) & there are things my RAV has that this doesn't, like cup holders that adjust (this car has lots of cup holders, but only 2 hold a 20 oz. bottle), stereo controls on the steering wheel, & a cargo cover. Spare tire & jack cost $75 extra on the Chevy! Would still buy again because we couldn't afford anything more. Cargo space is worth it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Traverse in November of 08. Extremely happy with the car at first but after 6 months you begin to realize the faults and what makes it a Chevrolet. I love the versatility of the car and love the way it drives. At first I really enjoyed the interior but after you get to know it, you realize there is a lot of plastic used in the car. Paying full price for the LTZ, it would be nice to have leather in places where there is plastic.</TEXT>

It's relatively affordable, fun to drive, and in no way do you ever feel like you're in a minivan. Well done, GM. </TEXT>

<TEXT>New Traverse LT2 owners. Out grew our 5 passenger SUV as we needed more passenger and cargo space. Researched a lot of vehicles, including Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Saturn Outlook, etc. This vehicle was, by far, our favorite. It has a great design, is very comfortable, drives like a car (instead of an SUV or minivan) and gave us the most features for our money. It feels like a luxury vehicle without the luxury vehicle price tag. We are glad to have an American made vehicle, especially one as fun as this! Welcome back Chevy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just purchased the Traverse last week. I am very disappointed in the ride and the design of the seats. I feel every bump in the road. The headrest on the seats points forward such that I hit my head on it with every bump. There is no way to adjust it or the seat to stop this from happening. The compartment on the dash board is worthless - too small to store much of anything and right in the sun to get hot. The back up camera is a necessity because you can't see much with the rear view mirror.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Everyone talks about the driving but as a passenger Ill review other things. First of all the dash is well put together. Buttons and stuff is very easy to use. Then there's the ride and interior. Its comfortable and quiet, but the captains chairs can be uncomfortable some times. Then there's maintenance. The Traverse is easy to clean. Ours is Black with an Ebony leather interior so it shows the red dirt. But it comes off EXTREMELY easily. Also even though its big, cleaning the roof and windshield is easy too! So overall, a great car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>WE have only owned the 2009 Chevrolet TRaverse LTZ a couple weeks. We love it so far. We still need to learn all the tricks with navigation and bluetooth phone but those are great features along with the cooled seats in hot Florida. We hope it is as reliable long term as we have too many gadgets to want to fix them. Only complaint so far is getting used to the many gears as it seems to downshift just as you go around an intersection wehre you don't completely stop but then accelerate after going around the turn. We had a Ford Taurus that did that many years ago. </TEXT>

Until our Chevy sales guy enticed me to drive the Traverse. A month later, I am in love. Have put 2,000 miles on it with no problems. It holds a large amount of stuff as well as 4 humans.

<TEXT> After my purchase I drove the Traverse on a 2,000 mile trip to Washington state via the Calif. coast highway. The Traverse averaged almost 19 M.P.G. highway and almost 13 M.P.G. around town ! This mileage has remained the same after almost 5000 miles on the vehicle and my Chevrolet dealer says that all is fine and all is NORMAL ! The mileage is T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E and what is worse,I can't do anything about it. I continue to pay for a fuel efficient vehicle and ,in reality, can't afford to drive this GAS GUZZLER. Chevrolet is somewhat less than honest with their mileage estimates ! I wish Chevy had this vehicle back and I had a REAL car ! Chevy's ads should be illegal !</TEXT>

<TEXT>Lots of good features, but safety and reliability are my main concern, so when I discovered that my brand new traverse, not an inexpensive vehicle, does not include a spare tire, a donut or even a place to attach one, I was shocked. It doesn't really matter that onstar can send help if you have a flat.. If you have no tire, and have to towed, what are the occupants of this 7 passenger vehicle to do? wait by the side of the road? taxi's are often not available in rural areas. For this kind of money, I am just appalled that gm would even produce a vehicle without BASIC family saftey items such as a spare tire. Moms, families, beware of the danger of being stranded at all times. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Being a past Honda/Toyota Girl all of my life, I was skeptical about an American car. Test drove the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Pacifica, and finally decided to try a Chevrolet, went to test drive the Equinox and saw the Traverse and fell in love. Once I drove it, I KNEW this was the car for us. My husband and I both recently retired, so we are ready to travel! Rides like a dream, quiet and so comfortable. We love being in our Traverse so much that after three months, we already have five thousand miles on it. Go USA!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just finished our 2,000 mile family vacation. I agree with the reviews about the hesitating downshift on the transmission. It can be annoying when passing and I'm not towing anything. The ride quality rocks and there is tons of room. I wished I would have sucked it up and gotten the AWD, but I got cheap. DO NOT BUY THIS CAR WITHOUT THE REAR CAMERA. It's a big car with a tiny rear window. If you don't have the camera you just can't see anything. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Traverse is actually better than I expected. Quiet on the road and you can't tell that the engine is running sometimes unless you check the tach. Wife tried to start it several times while it was running...no problem it locks out the starter. Very good power although apparently the transmission has been optimized for mileage (at 60 mph it's running at only 1600 RPM) so it's slightly sluggish until it downshifts out of 6th gear. The mileage is MUCH better than I expected getting 21-22 mpg in suburban driving and the advertised 24 mpg on the highway. That seems remarkable for such a big car. Overall it's at least the equal of it's competitors such as the Highlander or Pilot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We are a family of 5. Me, my husband and three grown children youngest one is 14 the other 2 twins are 16. So we needed room, my husband Mark was against a mini van and the gas mileages on most suvs are not good. We look at different vehicles for about a month off an on, mostly imports because of their reliabilities. Test drove the Honda Pilot and was about to buy when we saw the Traverse drive by. Read reviews,& went to dealer. Fell in love, At first we were going to buy one with the ench seat in the 2nd because of having 3 kids. Decided on capt's chairs. The kids all have plenty of room and fight over the the 3rd row because they sit in middle & stretch they leg between the capt's chairs.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very roomy, handles more like a car then a suv or mini van. Navigation with traffic updates have been right on so far. My favorite is the power 281 hp and we still get over 20 mpg. Most suvs that get that good of mpg are 250 hp or less. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have owned car for 3 months, very stylish outside. Have LT1 version, interior seats are very nice though a bit uncomfortable especially for your lower back. No carpet in the back seats, basically a big floor mat latched down. I get 20.2 MPG. My biggest problem with the car is the location of the oil filter. I have changed oil on dozens of vehicles (new and old) but never had to change the filter from the top of the engine. There is not enough room to place a filter wrench on the filter, it took 3 hrs for 3 men to unloose the initial high torqued filter by hand. When the filter was loosened it went all over other components located underneath the filter. Otherwise a great car and roomy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had about a week now, but immediately took on a 7-hour each-way trip over Easter to visit family. Very good driving vehicle. Quality seems very high. Engine is more than adequate, even though we moved from our beloved 02 Suburban. Seats on all three levels are better and roomier than the much bigger 'Burb! Not quite the road presence as the 'Burb, but what else does? Air conditioned seats should be standard on all cars! They are just wonderful. Rear entertainment system w/wireless headphones a total necessity for the two boys in the back. First time for them; they loved them. Navigation hiccuped a few times, and I'm hopeful the dealership will address this. Good traction.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I drive a VW Jetta and a Maxima and we needed to buy a SUV (NOo!!). But, our first baby is due in September and we needed a family car. So we went off and test numerous SUVs; Honda Pilot, Acura MDX, Infinity FX35, Mazda CX-9 and Nissan Murano. All most of them had the same options and features, but somehow the Chevy Traverse stood out from all of them. First, the design was eye catching (Generally I don't like the look of Chevy cars) sexy and aggressive at the same time; Second, the features where all comparable or even better than the other top-end models of the other manufactures I mention above. Finally, the price and interest rate from Chevy BEAT all competitors. GO USA!!</TEXT>

Good pick up speed, fairly quiet, very smooth, handles well. First tank of gas 16 mpg city with a few quick accelerations. We tested, Hyundai Veracruz, Kia Sorento and Borrego, and GMC Acadia. Chose Traverse over Acadia due to looks, price, and Edmunds reviews. Daughter loves hooking up PS2 and playing video games w/ rear DVD. We love the headphones she uses so we can play our satellite radio while she plays games or watches movies. I'm 5'7" 215lbs and fit comfortably in 3rd row.

There is plenty of room for my family of four (2 yr old and 7 mo old). Sliding the 2nd row seats back as far as they go gives a ton of room to get the kids in and out of their car seats. The cargo room behind the 3rd row fits our ginormous double stroller with no issues. I get 22-24 MPG on the hwy and 19 overall. Not bad, but I feel it could be better. The roof rack cross rails whistle terribly above 50MPH (I've removed them since). The 3rd row would be a tight fit for 3 average size adults, little head and hip room (I'm 5'9" 189lbs).</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just purchased a Traverse. We are extremely happy with the vehicle, but last night while driving in the interstate one of the tires split in half while going 70 miles per hour. We are extremely concern with the quality of the factory tires in this vehicle.The tire was melting as I was exchanging it. To replace a tire is one of the most challenging task you will perform. The tools included are not the best for the job. Our main concern is the safety of our family and we are not sure with the tires on the vehicle. It remind us of 8 years ago when Firestone had to replace a lot of tires because of safety reasons, just after few lives were lost. Chevy, please look into this matter. </TEXT>

I test drove Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander & Sequoia, GMC Acadia, Buick Enclave and Mazda CX-9. This Chevy Traverse won over all these in almost every category. She didn't like the style of Honda and Toyota. The Buick did not have a strong feel to it on the road. The Acadia was her favorite but I kept after her about the fluky transmission leaving her somewhere. The Mazda was my favorite by feel and tranny. We both drove the Traverse and were blown away by it's responsive transmission and great ride. Try one out for yourself and you'll see!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle as our primary family hauler. We really need the AWD and third row hauling capacity. The car drives and handles much better than the escape it replaced. The gas mileage is acceptable for a vehicle of this size although not much better than a Tahoe. Power is adequate even in mountain driving. The transmission is very smooth shifting. I find that is isn't slow to down shift at all but very quick to up shift.I assume that is to improve the mileage. So far we are averaging 19mpg in combined driving. I expect it to improve as it gets broken in. Cargo room is adequate for weekend trips without folding the seats down. </TEXT>

I laid on my horn and steered left as the car that pulled out still was crossing left with no signal. I slammed on my breaks thinking that I should have gotten gap protection when the entire car locked up and stopped me from smashing into this guys rear end.

<TEXT>I'm very tall (nearing 7') so it's hard to find a vehicle that just plain fits; other bells and whistles are a secondary concern. The Traverse is not only comfortable for me but offers incredible passenger room and storage capacity. Lots of great/thoughtful design choices in the cabin. Front seats are the most comfortable in the crossover class by a mile. I've been impressed by how well the A/C system heats/cools the large space, as well as how good the Bose speakers sound. The drive is superb: quiet, powerful, smooth. This should be high on the list for anyone in the SUV/crossover/minivan market. It's been years since I've had a GM, but the Traverse might well have brought me back for good.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ample safety features and thoughtfulness of the interior design are great. There are cupholders and places to store things everywhere you turn. Exterior styling is also nice.

<TEXT>We have had 3 seated TrailBlazers, and loved them. Traverse was the next choice. As far as just driving it for my wife and I, we love it. However if you have kids and use the seating, not so much. The way the seats fold to get to the third row is not a smooth procedure. The seats ride on tracks that you have to kneel on to lift your child into the back seat. Very uncomfortable on your knees. Also toys, and small things get dropped into the tracks, effecting the operation of the seats. When you try to dig them out, you get grease on your fingers. If the rear window opened up (like the TrailBlazer does) loading would be easier. when you open the hatch, everything falls out.</TEXT>

Even our 22 month old son must have a good feeling about the Traverse because he gets ridiculously happy when we put him in it. It feels like you're driving a car but it comes with the security of feeling like you're in a big truck.

<TEXT>With the current auto market conditions, we were able to buy a LT2 FWD for $8k under sticker. We got heated leather, split rear seats, XM, rear camera, power liftgate, remote start, etc. Cyber Gray. $37k crossover for $29k!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very fast heated seats and heater. No squeaks or rattles. I consider the Chevrolet Traverse as being the best looking vehicle of the GM crossovers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looked at Highlander and Pilot and the Traverse beats both hands down. Has a very quiet and smooth ride. Exterior styling is superb. Overall build quality is very impressive. Don't assume Japanese competitors in the large midsize SUV segment are better, there not. The vehicle shows that GM can produce a world class vehicle for a reasonable cost.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just purchased this about two weeks ago, but it has already met all our expectations and exceeded some. Cannot say much about MPG, because we only have 475 miles on the vehicle. Only two areas needed repair/adjustment. Left side doors off a little in alignment, and seal for driver's window crimped. Doors have been aligned and window seal is on order. It is very roomy, rides very well and the Nav system is greatly improved over our 2007 GM vehicle, although screen size is a little smaller. Very stable on rural roads and interstates. Turns very well at local speeds and turning radius is excellent.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dual sunroofs, DVD player, captain's chairs and heating & cooling system is above reproach so far.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Quiet and handles wonderfully. AWD performs great in deep snow and snow packed surfaces.Would not own a vehicle without AWD in the Chicago area. Engine powerful, but quiet. Yes, American car makers can make a geat car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling and roadability. Have gone through two snowfalls of 10 to 12" and this car never hesitated or failed to brake properly</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just bought this SUV, upsizing as our 3 young kids get older and want to bring friends along. We live in a very snowy area and need AWD and were not thrilled with the idea of the Toyota Sienna. We looked at the Pilot, MDX, Highlander, etc. and were wholly unimpressed. Drove and bought this SUV the same afternoon. Great design and ridiculous pricing. GM is on the way back (probably bankrupt, but will re-emerge better than ever). Don't bother with the GM standard DVD, get an aftermarket for a fraction of the cost.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I finally splurged and got the black on black Mercedes I had always wanted. As a single mom of 3 boys, I was ready to get into something sporty. After 7 months of driving a little tiny sedan (C300), I realized that it just wasnt practical. Having 3 boys (ages 17, 7, & 6), I need something that's tough, practical and can withstand how hard we are on our car. I went to a dealership with all intensive purposes of purchasing a Tahoe. I had 3 in the past and new I loved them. The dealer had the Traverse LTZ on the show room floor. I test drove it & was so relieved to have that Solid, Chevy SUV feeling back. Test drove the Tahoe & decided I loved the Traverse LT2 in silver! Love it! Get one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Black leather seats, DVD/entertainment system, the rearview camera, the space, the smooth ride, the solid feel, heated seats, turn by turn directions, ease of use. Value for the price (fully loaded Chevy vs. stripped down Benz)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>4th in a long line of SUVs (Ford, Honda, BMW, Chevy). This SUV looks the best and has the strength the others do not (towing). Very comfortable driving position, plenty of room for a family of 6 and everything needed for long vacations. AWD has performed as expected in inclement weather (ice, snow). The qualtiy of this vehicle seems to be better than the previous Chevy I have owned. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Backup cameras, sensors. Driver's side leg room, driving position. Remote start. Smooth ride. Audio system is intense. Exterior styling</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you took the bowties off this SUV you would not believe it is a Chevy. My wife and I are very impressed. It was a leap of faith to order one without actually seeing one like it and driving it. We are not disappointed. Maybe I am too much of a Chevy man with some bias, but this is one great vehicle to drive and ride in with excellent build quality. We got the LTZ in Black Raven (I think that is what it's called) and it has some metallic it in. Beautiful especially in the sun. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drive ride and build quality. Lot of room with plenty of cup holders. Love the sliding center console arm rest and storage area. The top of the dash has a nice storage area, too. The inverter is a very nice feature with the 115V outlet in the rear of the console.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Can't find too much to complain about yet with this car. It's roomy and rides well. A lot of nice features come with it standard (i.e. XM radio, OnStar, built in phone). Gas mileage has been as advertised so far. I guess there are two things that are slightly bothersome about it and both have already been mentioned by the editors. It tends to be a bit slow to downshift and there is a fair amount of plastic in the car. However, these two minor imperfections really haven't bothered me that much. Overall, I feel that this is a quality car that Chevrolet has put out. I would recommend this car to the person who needs space, towing capacity, and decent gas mileage to go along with it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Split seating. This is a wonderful feature! I also like the quiet, smooth ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Traverse handles much better than the other GM "clones" and the new direct injection engine revs so quick and willingly. Mileage is running 19/20 overall except when my son drives it and then it drops 2 mpg. Traded in a 2008 Mazda CX-9 and this is a far better vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine provides quick power for merging.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just purchased our Traverse last month. I drove it over 800 miles during the Thanksgiving weekend. So far, we love it! Smooth, quiet, roomy, and with the leather and LT2 package, luxurious. Kids are comfortable in all seats (16 year old son is almost 6 foot). Ride quality is tight and free of any shakes or rattles. Great time to buy with GM adding bonus money I would definitely recommend one to family or friends.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smoothness of the ride, bluetooth phone feature, turn by turn nav system is simple to use and outstanding. Engine/transmission combo operate very well. Great looks. I could go on but you get the idea. I'm very happy with it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a nice all around crossover. For people that love an SUV it delivers. For people that love a mini van it has the qualities without the looks. The styling of the interior is well put together and I love the easy use push buttons for the climate and audio controls. The best part is the way it drives! Fun, fun, and more fun. GM seems to have put a lot of thought and quality into this vehicle and I just hope that it performs like this for many years to come.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The way it drives, the quiet ride, leather seat styling, 10 speaker Bose audio system with the XM radio, auto start and alarm system, rear audio controls for the kids. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This SUV is an eye opener for what it delivers to it's driver. I've purchased driven a number of GM products over the past 18 years, and love how the quality and features that GM provides has grown continueally during that time. Yes, they used to be bad 20 years ago. But today, wow! Do not miss out on trying a Traverse before you buy anything. Even the dealership experience was the best I've ever had too. I'm moving from a full size pickup to this mid-sized SUV. Originally planned to buy a Tahoe, but the economy has downsized my buying ability slightly. Thank goodness GM made this SUV, it fits perfectly!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride must not be missed, it is excellent. The nav system is very nice and quick to respond to controls. Room inside the Trav is actually bigger than a Tahoe! The remote auto-start has a nice feature with also auto-adjusting air/heat/seat heat/defroster depending on outside temp. Wow!</FAVORITE>
