<TEXT>Was skeptical at first as it looked really small from the outside. My husband said "get in and try it out". Once seated in drivers seat, I was hooked. There is a lot of room in this car. I was impressed. The car has a lot of zippiness and it fun to drive. Purchasing gas is also sweet. I can go 7 days on a tank of gas (back and forth to work (60 miles a day) and tooling around town). Very impressed with that aspect. Stereo has nice sound. I like the storage system in the back of the car for shopping. Backseat is roomy for a 6' person to sit comfortably. All in all I'm very happy we purchased this vehicle when we did. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased used with only 12k miles. 2.4L (toyota camry) engine and 5 speed auto/manual a great combination. This is not offered on the Toyota Matrix. GT model rims/tires are nice, but noisy on rough roads and you feel the bumps. Versatility and appearance are better than average. Handling is excellent because of full independent suspension, wide/low profile tires and sport tuned suspension. I did my research and compared to Matrix, Versa, Mazda-3 and Fit - Vibe GT model won out for best combination fuel economy, performance and SUV type features in a compact hatchback. GM warranty a plus (100K powertrain). Mileage should be around 30+ on highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car does a little bit of every thing. I can haul a trailer, put the seats down, seat 4 adults 6 ft or taller and get good mileage. This car does it all. Pluses include room, ceiling height, get up and go, mileage and style. The biggest negative is road noise, just turn up the XM radio. 17,000 miles after a year and 2 months of ownership, just change the oil and rotate tires. MPG is 28-30 with mixed driving with quiet engine. The seats are comfortable and fit taller people well I'am 6.1 and can wear a hat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Took my Vibe (a rebadged Toyota Matrix) in its first month of ownership on a road trip across the country after taking advantage of the Clunkers program. No major issues or squeaks and rattles have arisen yet. Have only changed the oil/filter and added fuel injector cleaner so far. Was getting a fairly consistent 30 mpg of mostly highway driving with a fully loaded car, bike hitch rack, and a codriver who doesn't know how to smoothly modulate a gas pedal. Vibe has decent midrange punch with the 2.4 to pass and get up the hills. Glad I opted for the bigger engine Overall pretty happy with my purchase as the car has been both reliable and practical. For the money this car is hard to beat</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>- Great value - 2.4l with 5 speed auto is a good match for this car - Decent handling and comfort at this econo car price point. - Ergonomics are well thought out with telescoping steering wheel, lots of cup holders (6ish?) and usable storage areas. ie glove box can swallow an SLR camera and GPS</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car 5 months ago to replace an SUV so was not sure about sitting lower to the road. I was pleasantly surprised by this Vibe. The drivers seat raises, giving me some of the height I used to enjoy. This car is just fun to drive! Pick up is great, handles well. My 17 year old loves to drive it too. I have not had a chance to try out the AWD yet, but if my current satisfaction is any measure I know I will not be slowed by any snow!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased the 2.4 2009 vibe with manual trans. I offered $200 less than the TMV and they accepted my first offer to my surprise. Great car and if you want to buy one, offer a ridiculously low amount to start with. They are practically giving these away with all the incentives. I wanted the 1.8L, but couldn't find one. The 2.4 is more than enough power, but I still get over 30 MPG with 50/50 driving, so I'm very happy. Manual is fun to drive and very comfortable. Cargo space is great, as I can fit my bike in the back without taking any wheels off. Sound system is great. I switched from a huge suburban to this and I don't regret it. Cash for clunkers program is a great deal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good gas mileage even with 2.4L engine with manual. Comfy seats, tons of cargo room, and very fun to drive. Can't beat the price right now. With CARS program, I walked out with a fully loaded Vibe (minus automatic and sunroof) for under 12k includings taxes with cash for clunkers trade-in.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased car end of May and have driven about 260 miles. Good mileage about 28 mpg with 50% city and 50% highway. Should improve with break in. 5 speed automatic shifts smoothly and 2.4 engine has plenty of pep. Comfortable and smooth ride.Would recommend. Vibe seemed to run smoother than its twin the Toyota Matrix and was priced better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very good radio with 3 month free XM. 1 year free On Star. Front seating comfortable rear seating adequate. Interior has lots of nice features and touches and exterior is sporty. Fold flat rear seats and passenger front seat give great versatility and capacity.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the 2009 Vibe with 1.8 liter engine and 4-speed automatic transmission. The power is sufficient and the gas mileage is excellent. The engine does not feel strained and remains quiet even at speeds above 80 mph. On the exterior, the Vibe is somewhat better looking than its sister, the Toyota Matrix. The interior is ergonomic, comfortable and well designed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had an 05 Vibe that I loved, but had to trade-in after accident. The 09 Vibe has everything I loved about my 05 Vibe, and more! The Stereo is excellent, the handling and power is awesome; too awesome, I got a speeding ticket before I hit 1000 miles on the car. I like the standard roof rack; the new cup holders are perfect, and I like the fact that the cargo area has anti-slide strips. Also a nice addition is the recessed cargo hooks. It's a fantastic car for the price!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car is great looking and is great on fuel as well. The lights go on automatically when it gets dark and with the sun roof the Gt 2009 Pontiac Vibe is an eye catcher. So many people stop and look at the Vibe. Has so many neat items that all work very well. AC works great, heater is great, wiper at the rear window is great, heater in the back window is helpful on a cold day to see things with the rear view mirror. Has a great radio and a jack to enter ones own music. Well all I got to say it is a great or nice car for almost anyone.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The instrument panel states what gear you're in like Drive, Reverse and so on. The RPM gage is neat with the engine idle reading. And it seems the Vibe has a great pick up on the expressway. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a 2005 that I bequeathed to my graduating college senior. I knew I wanted another Vibe but was a little too late to get the last of the 2008s with the sweet rebates. 2009 Vibe is basically the same though the car's cosmetics have changed. There's no longer plastic cladding and bump strip nor the nearly useless roof rack standard. The change is supposed to be better looking but it looks more like a Prius or Versa now. Maybe not quite as young looking. The interior cosmetic changes are mostly an improvement but I really had no problems with the way it was before. Maybe the car is quieter now. Standard features in the 2009 make the slightly higher base price still a great value.</TEXT>

We have only owned it a week (purchased 05/09/08) but have found it to be a practical but fun family ride. Gas mileage is as promised and should get better when the car is broken in. Great value for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2005 vibe awd that was horrible in the snow etc. It was like it didnt even have awd so I traded it in quickly. I test drove the 2009 Vibe awd and it was much much much better in snow. Pricing is good but gm needs to put some incentive on it, even Toyota is offering 0 percent on the Matrix. So I am waiting a bit to purchase unless the Subaru Forester comes out with some good incentive (great car too) first. Subis do have the best awd. I like the new vibe the 2.4 engine is a big big improvement over the 1.8 quiter, peppier smoother. I do think they should offer the 5 speed auto Rather than the 4 speed with the awd. Mileage would be better, get up to date gm and Toyota. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>awd option, also it is improved. traction, vsc standard. nice design feels much higher than most small cars, easy to get in and out of. 2.4 engine nice, good past reliability ratings. xm radio, on star, decent price if would offer some incentives like other gm cars with big rebates incentives</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A very nice way to put 14 minivan years behind me. Like minivans, my Vibe is practical and versatile. Unlike minivans, the Vibe is economical and fun to drive. But the Vibe GT is a few details short of perfect. I exchanged the 18-inch wheels standard on the GT for the 17-inch wheels optional on other models. I lost some tight cornering ability but gained a whole lot more in noise reduction and comfort. Blind spots force me to trust the mirrors more than I?d like. I had back-up sensors installed to allay fears that I would back into something or, worse, someone, such as the grandchildren who live with us. I would have also appreciated an in-dash compass. Still a great ride and purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very good balance of fuel economy and acceleration. Excellent handling and braking. Fun to drive. Bold yet not bizarre styling. Versatile interior. Easier to configure, load and unload than my old minivan. Tap-shift gear set-up is excellent for downshifting on hills. Lots of airbags. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had been researching new models (Honda Fit, Yaris, and Versa) when the 09 came out. Was pretty much set on a Nissan Versa. The Vibe was only about $2000 more than the Versa comparably equipped. With the added features not available on the Versa (ABS, disc brakes all around, stability control, traction control, XM radio, On Star, and hands free phone) it made the Vibe a very nice upgrade. I now have 1300 miles on it, and have averaged 32.6 mpg 50-50 hwy/cty. The 5-speed is very smooth and nicely placed high on the floor. Ride is great; performance is more than adequate while delivering excellent gas mileage. Really a nice car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my 2006 Vibe and purchased it due to the reliability in northern snow, gas mileage & the height of the seating, head room and the ability of additional load capacity when the back seats are down. I also love the side covers that protect the bottom of the doors and around the tires where road rocks put pings on most autos and hurt the paint. Your new 2009 Vibe has changed most of the good features by lowering the height of the auto, making it less apt to maneuver in deep snow. Lowered the angle of the windshield at a loss of head room and removed the protective side panels so the new 2009 would look sportier. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the 4th AWD drive Vibe I have owned. I had to purchase it sight unseen since my '05 lease was ending. I was delighted to hear that Pontiac was bring the AWD back, since it is such a fun, easy, efficient car to do errands around town. I only have 200 miles on it so I suppose I need a little time to adjust. It is attractive outside and I love the bright red. Inside, as a 5 foot tall women, I am still bothered by the lowering of the rear view mirror to accommodate the Onstar system, and the repositioning of the front right roof columns, along with the larger side mirrors. These 3 things seem to change my sight lines-they are different than my others models. </TEXT>

We've already taken a weekend road trip with the vehicle and comfortable carried my wife, child, dog and all the necessary gear associated with the aforementioned. On the highway, we achieved 30 MPG, in town around 25 MPG. The ride is very smooth and quiet, with minimal road noise. There are no squeaks and rattles so far (which drive me crazy) and the fit and finish is clean and tight. Storage room is ample for compact car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have just purchased a new 2009 Vibe with optional auto/manual shift package, 17 chrome rims/rear spoiler, and other little misc. options as well. The car is definitely worth its weight in gold, I traded in my 2003 Grand Am, and am very impressed that Pontiac has stuck with the great responsive, sport like steering. The car overall has great body lines, interior is comfortable, and the fold down rear seats including the passenger are a great feature. The overall pick-up response of the car is very impressive, especially in manual mode where you can get the few extra RPM's when wanting to get that "race feel." Overall, you can feel the great quality everytime you get behind the wheel. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I've only had this car for 2 weeks. It's so much fun to drive, and handles like a much more expensive vehicle. The ride is quiet and smooth, and the 2.4 engine provides more than enough power. The interior seems spacious and all the controls are in easy access. The interior uses alot of plastic, however it does not look or appear cheap. The seats are very comfortable in the front and rear, and the cargo space is incredible when the rear seats are folded down. The A/C blows nice and cold which is a plus, since I live in Florida. I wanted the upgraded radio, but mine has the base radio, however it sounds great. I've driven in some very heavy rain, and this car was terrific! GREAT CAR!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our 2nd Vibe, the first being an 05, which was a great vehicle. This one easily surpasses that. Very smooth and quiet, by comparison with good power. Fuel mileage has been outstanding. With the rebates and credit card points available it was a deal we couldn't pass up, even though we weren't in the market for a new car. However, my wife has already informed me that she will be getting a speeding ticket as this Vibe is much quicker and smoother than her old one. We're extremely pleased, again. Can't believe GM won't be offering this vehicle any more. Major mistake! Please reconsider, GM.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I must admit that I too was driving my Vibe for the first week in third gear not realizing that 3rd gear is left and 4th(overdrive) is right at the same position on the automatic shifter. That erases my earlier comment on the need for a "4(forward)speed transmission" as the 1.8L Vibe has one. ...not sure I understand the comment about the noisy ride as mine drives quietly---certainly less noise than in the '03 version.

<TEXT>I waited for the AWD to return in 2009, and am happy I did. Nice, tight steering, it has more pickup than my 6 cyl Stratus, & the AWD plows through snow like a champ. Lots of cargo space and super-versatile layout. I can fit almost anything that would have fit in my Blazer. CONS: I wish the Vibe offered more options. In this day and age, it?s crazy that you can?t get power seats even if you want them! Like others, I noticed the chippy paint, but thought it was due to living on a rocky dirt road. Also, everyone is raving about the milage- it?s ok, but I think a car of this size could do better. Overall, I LOVE it! This is a great car for the money and I would happily buy another.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Vibe, by far, is the roomiest and best-riding car in its class and it is very fun to drive. Having previously driven a Suburban, surprisingly, I do NOT feel like my bottom is dragging on the ground. This car was purchased primarily for driving around town with kids in tow. There is plenty of room in the back for them being in car seats. My dog even enjoys riding in the "trunk"! For those of you who think the Vibe is comparable to the Dodge Caliber, you're thinking WRONG! I drove the Caliber and the Vibe in the same day and there is NO comparison. The fuel economy is also great. I just filled up my tank in the Vibe and calculated 26 mpg city driving in 3rd gear! (see improvements)</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Vibe---my first is an '03 with 103K miles which my teenage son will inherit. The '03 has been flawlessly reliable! I purchased the '09 last week at an incredible deal--$4300 off in GM/Driver's Edge card rebates, $3000 in additional rebates for paying cash, and at a price that was well below invoice!! I was a little concerned that Pontiac parts might not be available in the long haul but GM insures me that Vibe owners will be supported for years to come. Since the power train is Toyota I am not concerned. If you are shopping for a reliable vehicle that gets great mpg--Vibe is the way to go.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>LESS THAN HAPPY</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I find it difficult to give this car much of a rating. I take my dog with me most everywhere I go, so I decided on the Vibe based on its size and practicality. I am very disappointed. This is by far the noisiest vehicle I have every owned! I find myself checking the windows to see if I left one of them open. There seems to be no sound deadening insulation in this vehicle at all. This makes long trips very tedious - and also makes listening to music impossible. Also, the AWD model should be available with a manual transmission - the automatic doesn't allow you to coast freely - it's always holding you back causing you to play with the accelerator to hold a constant speed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>All I can say is that anything would have suited me fine after having driven a Daewoo Lanos! But, I always admired the Pontiac Vibe for its adorable design since the first time I ever saw it. These new defined designs of the car is just stunning! I've got the GT, and I love how this car looks! As an art major, it has been just spectacular having so much cargo space to haul my sculptures and oversized paintings. Very reliable car, not to mention it is crazy fun to drive. One thing I thought was great about the car was the magnificent interior design, but this is coming from someone who used to have cup holders directly under the radio, so I guess there's room for improvement on that note.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gorgeous design, beats Matrix and Caliber. Awesome 18" alloy wheels/ they look great, unsurpassed interior luxuries, lots of cargo space, loving the stereo system, very smooth ride/which helps to ease stress on fragile pieces of artwork I often move from place to place, 'I mention it looks great?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>MPG 30.5 mixed. Comfortable, spacious, nice ?tall? driving stance, solid feeling, good 4 wheels disk brakes, fun-easy to drive. Electric steering wheel is somewhat different but ideal for every day operation. All of the important features (especially safety) are there. Well thought out interior (including 120V outlet) and exterior (plastic molding are in the right places and may better resist winter salt). The engine is not too responsive when driven softly but wakes up when RPM >2000. BTW this Toyota engine is used by the Lotus Exige sport car. A fifth gear would be nice on the highway. My wife loves it. I take very opportunity to drive it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a Toyota truck just because of payments, but I love Toyota. When I read that the Vibe was essentially a Toyota, I went to the dealer because everything I read was good. I have never had a small car, so I was hesitant, but this car is actually fun to drive and the MPG is awesome--right now I'm getting 28-30 in combo driving. Yes the wheel caps fall off and yes the ride is bumpy, but I am not sorry I traded--except when I needed a half ton of mulch last week.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This the third Vibe we've owned and each one has had exceptional gas mileage. The last Vibe got 30.1 miles per gallon for 29000 miles. This 2009 is averaging over 30 miles per gallon too. Repairs have only required service oil,filter,tire rotation and alignment on the 2006 model. The 2009 has only 3000 miles and has had no repairs as of yet. On the 2009 model I miss the carpeting on the deck in back the shade covering that area along with the intermittent window washer. Other wise the 33.2 miles per gallon on a recent trip is great. I hate to see the Pontiac line disappear. Maybe they will give the vehicle to Chevrolet for a boost in their division car mileage requirements. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Pros: Toyota Engine -Great gas mileage -Sporty look Cons: Noise every time you go from park to drive and start to move. It is the anti-lock breaks kicking in. Drove three others. Same thing. Dealer said it was not designed very well because you could hear it kicking in. - XM radio cuts song title information off. I had XM 5 years ago and my radio could display the entire song. Cuts it off even if you switch to non-flashing mode and have to push info button. Bad design! - Doors make a slight vibrating noise when closing them. Again tried 3 others and same thing. Body design flaw - Little noises coming from the dash area even when driving on a smooth highway or road</TEXT>

The only trouble I have had is that the center caps on rims came off. GM will only pay for them once, then you are on your own.

<TEXT>I've owned my very fun-to-drive Vibe GT for ~2 weeks and so far I love it, although I agree with others that there are a few things that it could use improvements which keep it from being a 10. I love the styling compared to its competitors (much cooler looks compared to Versa, Matrix, Fit, '10 Mazda3[what did they do to this car's front end?]). I love the value; it has everything you need a few great extras, and you can get a loaded GT for ~$19K if you shop around (again better than the competition). Nice standard extras are Monsoon w/ XM radio, OnStar, steering wheel controls, leather accents, ABS, traction, 18" alloys. Also love the cargo versatility of the hatchback.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my '08 Pontiac G5 (had tons of probs) for '09 Vibe bc of the wonderful ratings I had read on the '08's...wish I would not have. Has been a dependable car but I haven't enjoyed having it since I bought it. Seems to be a step down from my car that I had previously. Road noise is terrible inside of car! Maybe I am just used to my super quite G5 (couldn't even hear it on while inside) but I have to continuously turn up radio as I increase speed so I can hear it. Odometer does not give me read out of how many mpg I am currently getting, how many miles I have until I am out of gas, or what % of oil life I have left.

<TEXT>I purchased my Vibe GT in Oct. 08 and have since put 10,000 miles on it. I find the car very fun to drive and nibble in city traffic, much more so than my old Pontiac Trans Am GTA. The 2.4L has plenty of power to do just about any task you ask it. The interior home is amazing for a small car and the cargo area is more than spacious. Driving in snow and ice is a breeze, at times you almost forget it should be slick conditions. The fuel economy has been pleasing with an average of 28 mpg. I have had as high as 31 mpg and nothing lower than 24 mpg. It's a great sporty little car with economy in mind.</TEXT>

The dealership found the electronic box on the bottom of steering wheel is bad and now the dashboard pieces that were taken off will not snap together. The plastic clips seem to be very brittle they break off easy. The XM radio is great as long as you don't go through mountains or valleys or even under shade trees signal will go out.The 2.4 has lot of power would not recommend 1.8.

<TEXT>We test drove a number of other small sedans/hatchbacks before deciding to purchase a Vibe. The ride quality and offered features seemed to be a cut above the rest of the pack. However, so far we are not too impressed with the build quality (center wheel caps fell off, sunroof leaks, rear view mirror vibrates, paint easily scratched; instrument panel rattles/squeaks in cold weather). Also, the gas mileage is only OK (averaging 24 mpg in mixed driving). Traction in the snow seems to be reasonably good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Pontiac Vibe GT, the first new car I've owned, in April of 2008. I cross-shopped it against a Honda Civic and a Mazda3 sedan. I found the Vibe to be more practical than the Mazda and nearly as fun to drive. It handles with confidence, and the 2.4L engine has ample power and a somewhat sporty sound. The appearance and build quality of the interior are nothing special, but the controls are well laid out and there are some useful features, such as the bag hook in the passenger footwell and the rear cargo organizer. Despite some quality control issues, I would recommend the Vibe to anyone looking for a small car that is highly practical, but also offers some driving enjoyment.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the smooth engine and sharp handling, and the styling is some of the best in this price range.

<TEXT>My girlfriend got a promotion and now drives 140 kms each day in winter conditions. We were looking for something bigger and safer over her 99 Metro. Settled on the Vibe due to the standard Traction and Stability Control (which isn't standard on the Matrix twin). Functionality of the car is great with lots of space (moved four winter tires and lots of gear while moving). I find the 1.8L to be plenty of power and gives upper level fuel economy (about 41 MPG Canadian average). Interior isn't anything special but seats are quality and thats all you really need. Perfect car for combining economy, function and a little bit of driving fun.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purposefully chose the 1.8l for it's higher gas mileage and have been getting 31 mpg combined so far. I wish some of the upper models were avail with the smaller engine, 2.4 is overkill and eliminates the point of a small, efficient hauler. The main competition was the Astra and I'm sad that the Pontiac isn't nearly as peppy for the same engine size and that it doesn't shift anywhere as smoothly. That said I like the layout of the interior a lot, everything is where I expect (not something I could say for the astra) and the price was sure right. The cargo area is great but really needs a dome light. I love that it's ipod ready and the AC works like a charm. It's a very comfy ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Never thought I'd say this, but all of the cup holders and storage cubbies are great. The seats are really comfortable for my bad back. Love that the rear seats fold truly flat. Roomy interior and back seats that a real person can sit in are a major plus for a small car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>2.4 l automatic with sunroof and sound package. It's fun to drive, but I think the sunroof sucks up about 2 mpg. I have never gotten over 30 mpg in the 5,000 miles I've driven it. I drive about 80% highway and 20 small town (no traffic jams) and get 27-28 mpg with conservative driving. I'm disappointed b/c I hoped I'd get what others reported during the months before I purchased. The ride is really rough, too. If I knew I'd get this mpg, I'd probably have stuck with another Sebring with a cushy ride. Also, in order to get the roof rack, I had to pay for custom wheels, so the option was really about another $1,000. I will probably trade it in the spring for a different American vehicle.</TEXT>

Once driving a GT I realized it had everything my 2003 lacked, especially power. Driving a lot of highway miles the difference in the upgrade to the 2.4L auto 5-speed is quite noticeable. I love the feel and comfort, along with the safety. I am definitely glad I invested in a Vibe once again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The change from the usual all red Pontiac lights and sticking with the Toyota's interior is nice. I love the leather trimmed seats, Monsoon stereo, storage, 3-prong outlet, storage bin in the trunk, sunroof, and overall sportier look.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased my Vibe one day and set out on a 2000 km journey the next and was very impressed with the ride and handling. Completing mostly highway driving the 2.4 L engine has lot of power and is able to cruise along comfortably at above average highway speeds. For a small car the gas mileage is not overly great and is better compared to a small SUV than a car of equal size. However, if the Vibe is going to be used for highway driving the bigger engine provides lot of power for passing and merging into traffic. One real benefit of this vehicle is that it is able to handle unpaved roads very well and the traction control is an added asset when coming upon loose gravel. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>provides some sporty accents along with the practical elements of needed cargo space. Driving console is well laid out with easy to use controls. 2.4 L engine distracts the driver from the fact that they are driving a small car. Good set of head lamps for unlit highway driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in my SUV for the more efficient Vibe (sounds like a trend, doesn't it? Luckily, I only ended upside down by about $900 on the deal). I was never a big fan of the older vibe. It just looked like a grocery getter, bland, wagon-like and just something moms and old ladies would drive. But the 2009 Vibe caught my eye, particularly the GT trim. It's sleek, sexy and with the economical yet punchy 2.4 L option, I was sold. This is the 5 speed automatic version (there's no option for this, hello Edmunds!). Small but roomy, powerful but economic (29 MPG on average!), great interior (the seats are SO comfortable), and this car is hot! Getting a lot of stares! I would recommend this car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Economical but powerful engine...the fact that this is a Toyota with Pontiac branding! Hello to saving $3,000 AND getting a load of options - Sunroof, sweet sound system, power everything (but seats) and cruise...you can't find a better bargain. Plus I know this "Pontoyota" is going to be reliable!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've had this car for about 2 weeks now and couldn't be happier. Replaced an 03 Vibe. Obviously, we liked its predecessor, but the 09 is safer, quieter, has slightly more power w/slightly improved fuel economy, and burns cleaner. Overall ride and handling are better as well. Although hard to find, get the 1.8 L engine w/the base model; you won't need the 2.4 L. If you can, go 1 step further & get the 5-Spd manual - better MPG, feel more power, and more fun to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the 1.8L with the automatic option. Some professional reviewers knock it because it isn't "fun" like a BMW or a Porsche. Well for the money the car is great. Build quality is A-1. Seating is comfortable and it can take 4 passengers a long way before any of them start to feel cramped. Bought it for our son who is 6'2" and 215 lbs (football player). He loves it. Gets great mileage. We got in the neighborhood of 34-36 mpg on the highway with the cruise control set at 70 mph. The 4sp auto tranny shifts smooth and the 1.8 engine won't win any races, but it's ideal for a car this size. Would buy it again in a heartbeat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've had this car for about 10 days now, and love driving it. Had to search hard for the 1.8 L/5MT, but worth the waiting. For the Base model, you won't need the 2.4L engine, unless you're going to be towing something. Compared to our 03 Vibe w/AT (we gave to our daughter), this car is quieter (engine noise especially reduced, road noise only noticeable at highway speeds), has more power, is much more comfortable, much safer (more [6] airbags, 4-wheel anti-lock disc brakes and Stabilitrak), and more fun to drive. And gets better MPG (well over 400 miles on 1st tank, gets better after break-in period)! Highly recommended; the best deal out there for a "compact" car, doesn't feel like one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife has a 2005 Vibe. Very reliable. We use it to car-top two kayaks, and I can fit my bicycle in it, with the back seats folded. It has gotten good mileage--close to 30 MPG. When I decided to get a new car for myself, I checked out the restyled 2009 Vibe and was impressed. It is much sportier looking, and the interior has been refined. The seats are firmer and more supportive. The vinyl on the dashboard and upper door panels is cloth-like in texture, and somewhat upscale. Hard to find the 1.8 liter engine with automatic, but one came through my local dealer and I snapped it up-- didn't want mileage penalty for the 2.4. The 1.8 is quite good and quieter than in the 2005.</TEXT>

One long trip to Nashville, 1000 Mi. Fun to drive, handles great, performance w/5 sp auto very good. Very useful cargo capacity. Interior nice upscale, except it could use a little more foot & leg room. Exterior styling more appealing than previous model Vibes. Looks good in Hot Red Metallic. Gas mileage could be better about 23-25 in city, on trip avgd. 27.5 mpg driving 75-85mph plus some city driving, AC on whole trip. Trade off for 2.4 perf., I guess. Wife's car mostly. Quality seems very good & so far very reliable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I only have one complaint with this car, the dead pedal in the car (the foot pad on the left for your left foot). I find it makes my knee sore after driving a couple hours. I have to constantly adjust my left leg. Maybe it is the angle the dead pedal puts your foot and leg in. Not sure but I do know it gives my left knee discomfort. I am working on creating a solution. Other that that the seating is very comfortable and room is very good. I feel safe in this car and that is a key feature for all buyers out their. Safety first, if you feel safe it must be good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We like our new vibe because of it's ease of getting around in traffic and parking. We like the mileage we are getting but feel it could do better with a 5-speed trans. But Pontiac chose not to offer it on awd model. We bought chrome wheels which turned out to be just plastic wrapped chrome that chips and peels. Pontiac does not stand behind these. The awd model gets a roof rack that is worthless. There is no option for leather or heated seats so we had these installed after market. Radio options are limited and no navigation system option. Pontiac needs to get off their rear and go to work with these option pkgs. Or people will just look elsewhere. I called Pontiac with chrome wheel problem an</TEXT>

With fairly aggressive driving, I consistently get 25 mpg combined urban/freeway driving and over 29 on the freeway. Very comfortable with a great sound system. You can take circular freeway on-ramps at high rate of speed and it stays firmly planted in your lane and with very little body roll. The "torquey" engine is always ready to scoot when you want to. My two previous cars were a Mustang SVO and a Taurus SHO and I really don't miss them. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I used edmunds.com to review wagons and chose the Vibe over its fraternal twin, the Matrix, and the Mazda3 because I liked its design and the price better. Love the ride! It is easy to get in and out of, sits high, and it really hugs the road. It has a zippy start and wants to go much faster than the speed limit permits, so when possible, I use the cruise control which runs very evenly (no fits and starts). So far I get 25-26 mpg in city driving. Stereo is great and the sunroof is nice for California. Storage capacity is excellent, and the rubberized surface makes cleanup easy. Price was $300 over invoice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned our black GT for 2 months and love it. We have put 3600 miles on it so far. We drove the base 1.8 auto and did not like it at all. First gear was very short and then when hit second it bogged the motor down. I felt as if I would have to floor it every where I went. Then drove a 2.4 manual and was impressed. Found that the base models seats were too soft and the head rest bothered my wife. Lastly I drove the GT and just loved it. Seats are extremely better and the handling is superior to base. It is a little more bumpier than base probably because of the tire size. I did not drive the AWD. If the AWD is not needed, for the extra bucks go for the GT. Average 30 MPG. 80% highway</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort, handling, style. Stereo sounds great (Tool sounds incredible). Seats fold down and produce a large cargo area. For the extra bucks on the GT you will get better vehicle that is fun to drive and all the base model owners will envy you. </FAVORITE>
