<TEXT>I took advantage of the cash for clunkers and got an amazing deal on this car. I have been driving a Mazda Protege 5 for the last 8 years. While the Caliber cannot compare to the Mazda in terms of performance, it is still a great car. It is a bit sluggish on takeoff, but using the CVT option takes care of that. My gas mileage has steadily increased as the engine has broken in and I am now averaging 29-30 mpg city and highway combined. My 6' friends are very comfortable in the backseat and have plenty of leg and head room. The cargo storage is amazing, especially with the rear seats down.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auto rearview mirror dim, lighted cupholders, excellent stereo, drop down speakers for tailgating, sits high and allows a great view of the road ahead.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I drove several different cars and finally selected the Caliber. We chose the R/T because we wanted the the power the 2.4L provided. All the little extras have turned out to be a lot of fun and add to the enjoyment of ownership. This is a lot of car for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had owned 5 Neons over the years before buying the Caliber. I am still disappointed about he termination of Neon, but I am extatic about this Dodge. Great mileage at 32-33 mpg..(I haven't taken it on a trip yet). The ride is superb and handling is great. The power is more than adequate, even with the tiny engine. I am very happy with the Caliber overall. The lighted cup holders are a wonderful dafety feature in my opinion.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Expecting the smaller engine to have no power or take-off, I was very pleasantly surprised with the combination of the 1.8 engine with the standard transmission.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a great car. I love this car. It is fairly quick, has a roomy and comfortable interior that is easy to keep clean and looking brand new, it has 17 inch wheels, anti-lock brakes are standard and has lots of airbags for safety. I read some "professional" reviews and they aren't so hot. I don't understand them at all. They clain the Cali is underpowered. BALONEY, I say. I have a 2.0 litre SXT and I am impressed with the power she puts out. I also own a 1979 Corvette 350 c.i. and I know speed and power first hand. I'm not saying the Cali is a Vette, but she will hold her own in her class. Anyways, it's all about decent power and good gas mileage for me. And it gets 28 mpg. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The review is actually for the SXT with the 2.0L and CVT. After trading in my old Dakota and taking advantage of a $5,000 rebate from Dodge, I purchased a new orange Caliber for $11,500 out the door! After looking at a fit, I decided to go this route instead. It is much larger, roomier, and better looking in my opinion. The gas mileage is great for a car of this size! I get about 32 mpg on my daily commute of 90 miles, traveling at no more than 60 mph. One year of free Sirius radio was also a plus! Dodge needs to do a better job of advertising their offers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I guess compared to driving a 1998 Jeep wrangler for 8 years a moped would seem more economical. I'm not knocking my hot little black convertible it was just time to put it down. And it came at the absolute perfect time. With 218,000 miles I traded that Jeep for a brand new 2009 Dodge caliber. I got 3,500.00 for the clunker and then Dodge matched it with an additional 3,500.00. Best deal ever! I love it. I have air conditioning, speed, good gas mileage, and it's so quiet. I have to admit, I did cry when I had to give up the first car I had ever bought with my own money, and I still have the key, but what a difference. It really makes me appreciate the road. I love my new caliber </TEXT>

<TEXT>Took the new car on Vacation. We love it. The car drives great. The elevated seating is awesome. The Sirius satellite radio is great. Good MPG. The Chill Zone is cool. We love the car. There is nothing else like it out there. The Fit is El-Cheapo compared to the Caliber. The Vibe is nice, but no options at this price. I would recommend a test drive. It is one great car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sirius radio, CVT transmission, Chill Zone for drinks, exterior styling, alloy 17" wheels. Best Warranty on the market. WOW!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Lee Iacocca said it best many years ago - "if you can find a better car - buy it". This car is one of the best cars I have found for day to day driving. It has everything you need and even some extras. This car has it all over the Ford Escort wagon that I traded in for the Caliber. I have been a design engineer for many years, so I feel that I can say with some authority, that this car is a good solid machine with no serious design flaws. It will last for many years in daily driving with very few problems (no - I don't work for an auto company!). This is the first "small" car that I have seen with midsize car seating room and comfort.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The CVT is the best thing to happen to the automotive world - I'm glad this car has one. I also like the firm ride, and SUV - like seating position. The interior is made of rugged easy to keep clean materials. High crash test ratings (5 star) due to its "heavy duty" construction (over 3000 lbs).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We love the Caliber SXT. It is like a small version of the Ford Edge. The CVT transmission is great. Good fuel economy and sporty. We looked at the Honda Fit and Nissan Versa. This car drives way better and feels like a car, not a toy. I would highly recommend the car. For the money, no one comes close to such a car. Best of all, it is American made in Illinois.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drivers sear raises and lowers straight up and down. Sirius radio is awesome, as well as the chill zone glove box. Lifetime powertrain warranty is unmatched by competitors. Rear seats have plenty of leg room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I selected the Caliber SXT a/t w/2.0 CVT. I drove 4 models over two months. The total rebates motivated me to buy, plus my shiny Red Caliber was a minimum of 20% less compared to competitors model's which would have fit my wants and needs. It has plenty of power for my mountainous terrain. It's quick enough to pass others safely on two lane roads. At 25 to 45 it provides a comfortable stress free ride. It's smooth, even "cushy." Same applies when driving at 70 mph on busy interstate highways. It fits a lot of gear: boxes, cases, stuff, amps, guitars, keyboards, drums, even an upright bass! My wife also likes driving it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats- material and feel; dash design, stereo and ac/heat. vent control accessibility; overall feel when driving or stopped; Overall exterior lines and look. Front grille that looks like the famous RAM truck; back lights and rear spoiler; movable arm rest and three internal storage compartments.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased after test driving the Scion XD, Nissan versa, Nissan Cube, KIA Soul, Chevrolet HHR. The Caliber is a far more substantial car, not "tiny" feeling at all. I got the 1.8 engine with the 5 speed manual transmission. What an outstanding combination. The car feels wonderful, corners really flat with great handling. Just took it out yesterday to the coast on a really windy hilly road. Great passing ability, pulls up just fine on hills. (Also 35+ MPG). It hit 111 yesterday, the AC works just great no problem at all keeping up with that heat on next to the lowest setting on the AC.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great AC! Great handling, solid feeling, very comfortable on the road. 35.8 MPG! Controls and stick shift very handy, lots of room, very well equipped for very little $$$.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'll say it right away... getting 33MPG and car is only two weeks old - 5 speed manual. 60% Hwy / 40% City Driving. Ride is comfortable. Bumps in road jolt the car, but not too bad. Quiet ride for type of car. Road noise is average I'd say. Toys inside are fun. GPS/MyGig unit is great. Downloading music is simple. Steering Wheel controls are great! UConnect bluetooth is the best! Car looks great with all the angles and wheels. Speakers are great. Pretty loud, no distortion. Handles well on corners. Headlights are nice and bright. Engine is quiet. Nav works great with real time traffic info. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>GPS / Nav / 9 Speaker System! DVD's can be played while parked. Gas Mileage is awesome! Haven't had a $30 gas tank for a long long time! Nice looking vehicle!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After looking at the 2010 Prius, 2009 Honda Fit, I've decided on the Caliber based on its superior exterior design, economical valve (cheapest of the three), safety features and roominess. Each of these categories, I found the Caliber had the advantage. Although the other two cars beat out my sexy Dodge in fuel economy, it would take years before the fuel economy to be an advantage since this car is $4000 cheaper than the Fit and $8000 cheaper than the Prius. I love the fact that I can fit my family of four comfortably. The ride is smooth. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love Sirius satellite radio. Hatchback feature allows for hauling versatility. Chill Zone. 110 Power Outlet. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my Caliber only 3 weeks ago. I bought the car on the spur of the moment, and am happy to say it was an excellent choice. Compared to other cars in it's class, it is comfortably roomy and has good acceleration. And I've been getting 30+ mpg, driving both city and highway! If you can love a car, then I've met my soul mate.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall sporty look and handling for a car in it's class. The stereo setup is great. Free sirius radio for a year and thumping speakers!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Most professional reviews of the Dodge Caliber complain it is underpowered, has mediocre handling, and has a cheap interior. My wife and I could not disagree more. Our car is a joy to drive! The CVT and 2.0L engine rapidly accelerate the car with turbine-like smoothness. The steering is quick and responsive. The ride is firm (though was stiff when new). The car handles very well; I can't detect any body lean going around corners. The controls are quite intuitive and well thought-out. The fit'n'finish is flawless. The interior is tasteful, restrained, very comfortable, and very high quality. We haven't yet found one manufacturing defect. 27 mpg in mostly city driving. We love our Caliber!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Small car but very roomy and versatile interior; driver's seat height adjustable; high ground clearance; 3 compartments in glove box; can plug mp3 player into sound system; front pass. seat folds flat for long cargo; easy to change oil; chair-height seats; cargo tie-downs; removeable cargo light</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great for transporting to art fairs large pictures, etc. Easy getting in and out of seats - love the set up of being higher in the seats looking out the wide span windows, makes one feel like sitting in a small jet cockpit! I did however, pinstriped the sides at the top line with gold pinstriping and it really set it off! Did'nt realize how much I would use the cold glove box until I left them in it and came out from shopping and they were still cold! Great stereo! Wish I could do something with all of the lights going on after stopping and and then fading. Great riding in it - smooth, but a little noisy than my last Toyota. But a lot easier to drive. A well thought out car design.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>roominess in the cockpit and roominess in the back seats. A 6'5" man can sit in it and not touch the ceiling and have comfortable leg room</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well, what can I say. I used to hate Dodge, but I went for a Saturday drive in my SUV and came home with my 09 Caliber SRT. The exterior looks are 100% more attractive than the standard Caliber, very aggressive features; that is what caught my eye. After taking it for a test drive, I was sold. I also own a BMW and this "little rascal" is more fun than driving the BMW. The suspension and steering is very tight with enough power to have some man fun! This will be my weekend entertainment. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Sitting inside, the headroom and line of sight is higher than most other "little cars". Feels like a small SUV, mileage like a sub-compact. The long rake of the windshield, large roof pillars and long low windows gives one the feel of sitting in an aircraft cockpit. The engine has a lovely "throaty roar" to it when pushed to perform. Like no other economy car I've ever heard. "Smooth, Sleek and Powerful" are the best words to describe the feel of driving this car. I love it! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>See this car in person. It just looks wild and wonderful compared to other "hatchbacks"! Take it out on the highway and give it some gas... Listen to the sound. Nothing like it.</FAVORITE>
