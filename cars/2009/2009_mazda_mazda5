<TEXT>This is a smart vehicle and one of the best buy in current auto market. I got the sport (A) at a price 2K lower than many midsize sedan sold in my area, like camry, accord, and altima! The 5 is very functional with a combination of minivan and samll SUV. However, I have to admit that some stuff needs to be improved. For example, the front AC wind direction is hard to adjust (I prefer the design of camry in this case). </TEXT>

<TEXT>After having our first baby in June and we decided it was time for a family vehicle. She wasn't sold on the 5 at first because she likes her "small, sporty, sedans". I knew all along that what she wants is no longer practical, so I let her test drive the Mazda 3 first. Reality set in when we put the baby seat in the back of the 3. Our leg room was definitely compromised. Next we test drove the 5 and she quickly realized the 5 was most practical for our new family. This was a tough one considering my father is a retired GM employee and am eligible for the GM discount. We wanted a vehicle suits our needs now and is fuel efficient. Unfortunately, GM doesn't carry a vehicle like the 5</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable, roomy (for now), sliding doors, autostick feature, fog lights. Standard side impact airbags are a great plus. Rear seats move and fold easily. Factory carpet floor mats are a nice touch.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased our Mazda 5 sport about a month ago with a Cash for Clunkers deal trading in a Kia Sedona. I wanted better gas mileage, and we didn't need quite as much space, but I didn't want to give up being able to carry extra people, or lots of stuff. This car was the perfect choice. I took it on a 600 mile trip a few days after I got it. We had no problem fitting my family and all of our stuff in it, and when we got there, we were able to fit the other family traveling with us in for short trips. My worst mpg so far has been 23 mpg around town on the first tank of gas. My best was 33 mpg, mostly highway driving on our trip. I have been averaging around 26 (mostly around town driving). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sliding doors (so kids can't hit the car next to you), seat position- not as high as a minivan, but way higher than most sedans, flexibility - you can carry people, or stuff.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I are expecting our second child in a few weeks and we're happy to have found the Mazda5 just in time. It's perfect for our growing family and the price is right! It looks way better than other minivans and is surprisingly roomy inside. I usually don't like driving all that much but I find myself looking for reasons to drive the M5! Oh yeah - and our 2 year old loves it too! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great handling, manual option with automatic transmission, sliding doors, cargo/seating versatility, and good mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Test drove a KIA Sedona first - roomy, good engine, plenty of utility, but the seats KILLED my lower back, more road noise than expected, drove a little wide, and the fuel consumption turned me off. Tried a KIA Rondo. It's more comfy, but the 3rd row is a joke. Tried the Mazda5 - QUIETER than Sedona, comfy seats, handling is WOW, took the road bumps well, mileage saves me $1200+/yr in gas compared to minivan. Highway is little noisy, but better with whole family. 3rd row is decent with LEGROOM + 2nd row adjusts. Perfect for small family and grandpa can tag along inside. Rides nicer than Mazda3. Kids love the windows. Brakes VERY well. I hear it eats tires, so inflate and rotate!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>handling is a dream, 3rd row seat, rear A/C, captain's chairs, split seats in 3rd row, controls in steering wheel, A/C stereo controls are EASY, adjustable 2nd row, hidden cubbies in back, styling, reasonable engine to work on, autoset A/C, ABS, Side Curtain airbags, MILEAGE saves $$. Sliding doors.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my 09 Mazda 5 one year ago when the first 09's arrived at the dealership. I have 12,000 miles on the car now. Went from a dodge grand caravan to the mazda 5. I needed a vehicle that got better mileage than the van, wanted it to drive more like a car, have flexible seating and be affordable. We are a family of 5. I love the way the car drives/handles. It gets good gas mileage (30 mpg highway)has flexible and comfortable seating. With the hatchback it's even a great car for transporting our 2 big dogs. We will soon be purchasing a roof top carrier--not a great amount of cargo space when the whole family is on a long trip. Why are there not more people driving Mazda 5's? Love Mine!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've been looking for a compact, good on gas, more than 5 pax vehicle and the Mazda5 is just that. The only vehicle that would come close to it's class is the Kia Rondo and IMO, looks somewhat weird. So far, the 5 has exceeded our expectations. Nice sporty styling, great utility, and standard features in this cute gas-sipper makes this vehicle an excellent value. Some people say that it's underpowered, and probably is with a full load, but it's more than adequate for my driving habits and the manual sport shift makes up for increased performance when needed. This 5 is fun to drive and you can't say that about a lot of minivans! We're very pleased with our 5!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling and peppiness. Better than expected gas mileage. Firm, supportive seats and decent ergonomics. Nice stowage spots, too. Cool little thing to drive! Superb value!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just drove it off the lot this afternoon but have test drove it and been eyeing this car for almost 2 years! What can I say...I LOVE it! We have two children and will need to carpool in the fall. The kids love the captains seats and the fact that they can move around and stand up in the car when getting into their car seats. I love the gas mileage, flexibility, and 3rd row. I've read reviews that mention that it's underpowered and the interior feels a bit cheap. I'm no car expert but as a mom of two who travels around town with her kids, it is perfect and super peppy for me. Plus, the interior doesn't seem cheap at all. I'm loving every bit of this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had our 5 since February and stumbled upon it accidentally after driving Hondas and Acuras forever! The CRV felt too big, the Acura RSX was too pricey, but the Mazda 5 was just right! Smooth ride, easy to maneuver, great sound system, good gas mileage and very comfortable. Haven't had a minute's regret even when next to the CRV and Acura on the road. Thought it would pain my heart, but I LOVE this car. Way to go, Mazda! </TEXT>

<TEXT>... and here's why. I've been researching a new car for about a year. Needed something for my 2 boys and I to get around town in. I went in knowing it would be small, and it is, and that's what's great. Drives like a car, looks like a Matrix, but better, and adds the convenience of sliding doors. The back seats are Captain's chairs, which makes getting to the third row a breeze. Adults CAN fit in the third row easily if they're not too tall, so don't let that deter you. I paid 18,600 for my Touring, and you can't get a six-seater for any less. No power driver's seat, but it's adjustable 3 ways so you can get it fairly comfortable. So cute!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We had a sports sedan that just wasn't keeping up with the needs of a family, but wanted to keep with a manual transmission. This was the only option out there with a 3rd row of seats and we're very happy with it. Plenty of cargo space, great safety features, peppy little engine that is seat-of-the-pants fun to drive, good gas mileage, and fantastic brakes. I always thought the crossover class was going in the wrong direction: crossing a car and a SUV. This is a cross between a Mazda3 5-door and a van: which surprisingly ends up with a "best of a worlds" feel.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This a fun car to drive, easy to park. I like to be able to haul "stuff" and people. It works well with my teenager on trips, also easy for my mom to get in and out of. I am a fan of the captian seats and negotiated leather seats in my deal for ease of maintenance. Have taken 2 road trips, the seats could be a little more cushy driving for 12+hours and do not leave the AC in the rotating interior air position or the AC will "freeze up" and not work. You have to then let it "unfreeze." If I had read the owners manual more closely, it is in there. I can't see spending 25-30K on a vehicle, though not perfect, I think this is a great deal. I hope it lasts for many years to come. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased this a week ago, and so far, so good. I got tired of lugging around a big minivan at 15mpg local, just to do mostly local errands, little league, lugging furniture from IKEA, etc. My family of 3 takes a 3000 mile road trip every year or two, and I did not want to sacrifice the comfort & cargo area of a van. The Mazda 5 seems like the perfect solution. Better mileage, sleeker (drives more like a wagon than a van) and I don't have to give up the cargo space I am used to having. I have used less than half a tank of gas so far, and cannot yet evaluate the true mileage. Much easier to park than a full size van.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I WAS a Saab fanantic until GM destroyed the brand. My last was a '99. I bought and older MPV. I found myself driving the MPV mostly as I have a 4yo grandson who lives with me and 2 others I drive a lot. I passed down the MPV to my daughter and bought the 5. I was sure I would like it as it is a form follows function design...remember when Saabs were?? This car is an incredible performer with decent finish at a very low price. I was waiting to write this until I returned from a 6 day/1700 mi trip with my 4 year old. I am 6'2" and 280+# and drove all those miles in reasonable comfort. It averaged 26mpg at 80mph. The bluetooth is simple and works well as well as all the other gadgets.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the interior room compared to the outside dimensions! The auto wipers work flawlessly as well as the auto headlights. The seats are small but amazing comfortable over long periods of driving. The little engine was "enough" in all situations. A/C is excellent!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Mazda 5 is the MINI Van everyone wants to love, my wife and were shopping for a MINI van and we test drove the Mazda 5 3 times plus borrowed my mothers Mazda 5 for a week and found that the Van wobbles at highway speed causing motion sickness problems for the passengers. The Mazda 3 has the same backend wobble as the Mazda 5 except it is more pronounced in the 5. We found that the wobble is only noticeable at highway speeds, however 90% of our driving is highway, in short this wasn?t the van for us. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car in Colorado and drove it Arkansas. It was great for me and my family. We have two kids (3.5, and 10 months). My wife sat comfortably in the back with the kid and luggage. We really packed this car down and still handled well. There are many way to configure the car and sitting six for short distances is great. For all the mini van haters the sliding doors are great for getting the kids in and out. Handling is great for a car this size. Overall, great car for the money. Mazda has done well. We are really enjoying this purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Even though the car had good reviews, I didn't want to drive it because, well, it's a minivan. So glad I saw it in person. It's so much cuter than a big ol' behemoth "mini" van. It's perfect. I'm hauling kids to college in 2 short years and I wanted something small enough to park and maneuver, but with room for "stuff." I knew sliders were great for little kids, but it didn't occur to me until I took my mom to church how nice that access is for an elderly person, too. My in town mileage has been around 24.5 mpg. The "auto" climate control is taking some getting used to.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was pretty skeptical that I would ever like a minivan, but we love our Mazda 5. I am amazed by how well it handles and how fun it is to drive. It doesn't have that big bloated feel and look of other minivans. We get better fuel economy than quoted for this vehicle. The good fuel efficiency and availability of a manual transmission is what sold us on this vehicle, but we have been equally impressed with the utility and ride quality. It has a very nimble feel to it that makes you forget you are driving a van. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have 3 kids and couldn't see affording $30,000+ for a new minivan or a cross-over. This car was much more affordable and will cost much less to maintain. It rides like a car, but has a interior layout like a minivan. We won't be able to tow a boat or carry an 8' wide piece of plywood, but we never did when we had that capability with our previous minivans. The kids love it, but we haven't taken the first vacation in it yet, so we may be sacrificing on space and power when the car gets fully loaded with luggage. I'm a tall guy and I push the limits on most cars. Leg room and head room could be better, but I fit and I like the feel when I drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got this car yesterday, but I had another 5 as a loaner for a week before that so I'm pretty acquainted with the car's peculiarities at this point. We were looking at everything from small hatchbacks like the Honda Fit and Toyota Matrix to full-size minivans such as the Odyssey and Sienna, but the Mazda5 seemed like the perfect fit for us: it has plenty of space for a small family (up to 2 kids easily; 3 would be fine until you have to go for a long trip), it's relatively sporty and maneuverable, and it's much more fuel- efficient than minivans. The kicker -- it's the only thing remotely minivan- like that offers a manual transmission.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only just purchased this vehicle after exhaustive deliberations. While the Mazda 5 is a fine choice as a practical, cheap, do-it-all wagon, construction is borderline flimsy and materials are cheap. My windshield creaks over every bump and the floor, pedals and steering wheel all take turns vibrating as if the car had 100K miles on it and bad tires. I hope to resolve these issues soon... </TEXT>

<TEXT>My family of 3 soon to be 4 needed to upgrade from our Civic to be able to carry two car seats some cargo and maybe grandma every now and then. We desperately did not want to end up in a mini van and despite what some categorize Mazda 5 as we love the sliding doors which allow pain-free baby loading into the car seat. Cargo room with the third row folded is sufficient but when the seats are up you can't even fit your groceries. Gas mileage is in the area of 24 MPG with mixed driving, enough power to propel 4 adults and a baby on any road or hill. Highly recommended to those who need larger vehicle but want to remain environmentally friendly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I might be one of the only reviewers I have read (and I've read TONS) that does not have a family yet! I am almost thirty and was looking for a bigger car to accommodate more people in the future but also wanted something portable, fun to drive, with great gas mileage. I stumbled onto this car at the Mazda dealership and loved it. I had been interested in a Honda Fit, CRV, or a RAV4. This car was the perfect compromise. My test drive proved this car to be much superior than those I had test driven. My only fear was that I would buy a "mini van." I think this hip car needs its own category. Perhaps call it a giant hatch back. Either way, I love it, and it suits my needs.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove this car for about a month. The mileage for the first trip was weird. On the 400 miles highway trip, I got 37 mpg. This is far exceeded the manufacturer claim. On the last leg of the trip about 90 miles a got 22 mpg. This is really weird since it's all on highway with the same road and traffic condition. I cannot explain the wide discrepancy. The second trip on the same road, the mileage was about 33 mpg. The interior material is a bit on the cheap side. The plastic scratches easily and the cloth material is not up to standard with Honda or Toyota. I got this for $17.2k, I am not sure this is a good deal. </TEXT>

We were amazed at the versitility, my wife was able to take my daughters basket ball high school team members to games in comfort, even tho some were pretty tall. The last row was a bit limited in the leg room area, but smaller girls did fine! It ngot great mileage, loads of cargo room (Christmas trees!) and build quality 2nd to none! </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I have a newborn. We needed a second car besides our Corolla and agreed that the main requirement of a new car was the fun factor. This car is a lot of fun from playing musical chairs between cargo, people, and space, it's cool. The ride is pretty cool too! I agree with most that a few more horses under the hood would be nice, but I'm OK because I like my gas mileage low. Handles well & looks great! No one ever knows what a Mazda5 is when you tell them but once they see it and ride in it, they become fans! We are young parents and knew this was a great car for our family but it's also a hit with friends parents night off. Who said you have to drive a Scion or Mini to be cool these days.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Xenon headlights. Bluetooth. Auto rain sensing wipers. Heated seats. Room for 6. Low 20's sticker. Is there a better vehicle on the market? We purchased our Mazda 5 last month and have not only loved the car but enjoyed tanks averaging above 30 mpg around town. Our growing family fits perfectly, our four dogs love the folded down cargo area, and we just came home from Vegas through snow with the vehicle handling perfectly. Notwithstanding some minor build quality issues, is is the best new vehicle we have owned in the last five years - and we have purchased 6. I recommend this vehicle to anyone.

<TEXT>Traded in my 2002 Dodge Durango for a Copper Red Mica GT. Loved the Durango, but not the 13 MPG. Only 460 miles on "Matt D Mazda" and my expectations have been met. Third row is too tight for adults, but fine for kids up to middle school. MPG running in low to mid 20s with mixed city and highway (22 and 24). I have not had the opportunity for a long drive (300 + miles), but feel advertised 27 MPG for automatic is not only achievable, but beatable. Vehicle feels quick. Some reviews critical of pick up, but I find more than adequate. Excellent ride and comfortable. Perfect vehicle to run errands with the family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought ours in September, sold a 2002 Town and Country LXi, traded a 08 Honda Odyssey in on that. We were looking for something affordable, kind of needed a 3rd row seat at times, better gas mileage. Our Odyssey averaged 16mpg, the T&C 17mpg. This car averages 23, we've seen 27+ highway. The 5 speed manual is as easy as it gets to drive. The suspension tuning is 2nd to none, sucks up all bumps with aplomb. Brakes are fantastic, steering response is spot on. As you would expect, acceleration isn't a strong point, it's about power to weight. Can't have MPG and HP it seems. We didn't like the 3's ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, MPG, flexibility, easy sliding doors, iPod interface. 3rd row seat simple enough for a caveman. Rear ac/heat vent controls.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As a father of 4, it was finally time to move on from my little five speed VW GTI. We needed an alternative to my wife's Chevy Suburban that would fit the entire family, while getting decent gas mileage and being fun to drive. The Mazda 5 fits the bill. Got the Grand Touring in Silver with black leather. While the quality of materials is a definite step down from the VW, the car is a great value for the price. This car offers everything I need in a tidy and sporty package: room for six (with some compromises on the part of all), very well equipped for the price, good looks, he "wow, this is cool" factor from my daughters' friends, solid handling. Very happy with my purchase!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the Bluetooth for my mobile phone, though it has been a bit glitchy at times. Extremely flexible interior with fold flat seats. Auto climate control, which I missed from my Audi A6 (two cars ago). Auxiliary jack for iPod. Rear air and middle row captain's chairs for my girls. Regular gas! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We are looking for a mini van type of car without the mini van look that will work with our two little boys. That's about the only one on the market now fits our need. We also looked at Kia Rondo, but we don't like the look of the car and the fact it doesn't have the sliding door. We got a base model 5 and installed after market navigation system and DVD. After market DVD player looks much nicer and takes a lot less space. Kids love it. And this is the only car my wife actually loves to drive. We are getting about 23-24 miles in town. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Look, sliding door, handling, great turning radius and price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only owned my "5" for a few weeks but I am in love with this cute thing!! I have always enjoyed driving but now I want to drive all day long. I have only seen 2 others on the road... what is everyone waiting for? It is so easy to get in and out of and I love all the features especially the dash and all the bright, easy-to-read displays. The 6-CD changer is a bonus that I am really enjoying, no more boring radio! I find myself looking around to see if people are watching my car! I drove the Mitsubishi Lancer, the Nissan Versa, the Chevy HHR and just stumbled across the "5"... best fall I ever took! Gotta go drive... bye!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ease of in and out. Design of the dashboard and the placement of everything. How cool looking it is... white is very pretty and shiny! The hidden storage is so cool and the way all the seats lay completely flat make shopping so very easy. I could go on and on. Try it for yourself & fall in love too!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We were in the market for a new car that would work with two small children, and were cringing at the thought of buying a large minivan or an SUV. The Mazda5 is a nice alternative at a nice price. We bought the top of the line Grand Touring for less than the base models of a minivan. The car has adequate acceleration, nice handling, and plenty of room for two adults and two kids. The third row works for short trips with adults if needed. I'm 6' 2'' and have tolerated short trips in the third row. There is plenty of headroom, but seats are really just for kids or small adults. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior: Third-row seats, easy to slide rear doors, hidden storage area under the seats. Driving: Amazing turning radius, very good gas mileage, easy to park.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Finally got the car I've had my eye on since the summer of 2005 when they first came out. Had been driving a 2007 CX-7 but just wasn't happy--had those famous fuel system issues/CEL 4 times. My 2009 GT was fresh off the truck. I've never had so much fun driving in my life. Took a hit when I traded in a car soon after buying...and I couldn't care less. Our two kids love it, my husband loves it and I plan on holding on to this as long as it still rolls.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hidden storage under 2nd row seats, heated seats, rear air. Handling and steering feel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Haven't put much mileage on it, but so far I love this car. It handles great, and my mileage is good considering I have a scooter lift in the back with the scooter. That's quite a bit of weight.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6 CD player, seat configuration, cup holders, smoothness of engine and transmission.</FAVORITE>
