<TEXT>I really wish I could love my new Enclave. This is my first GM purchase and my first American car. What a frustrating and disappointing experience, so far. In less than a month since taking delivery of my new 2009 Buick Enclave CXL AWD, and with less than 800 miles logged on the vehicle, my new car has been in for service three times for the same engine vibration problem. The fuel injection system has been cleaned, fuel injector and ignition coil replaced and now the service techs are "looking more deeply into the cylinder head and valve train." (YIKES!) Vehicle downtime now stands at an abysmal 50%, since taking delivery. I was so hopeful for GM, but this car simply doesn't work.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Enclave is an excellent choice if you are looking for a premium suv. We compared to the Acura, Lexus and Lincoln models and chose the Enclave because it has more room than the competition along with superior comfort and performance. To date, the quality has been excellent and the comfort and ride dynamics have exceeded our expectations.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Buick claims a city gas milage of 17 mpg on the EPA sticker. In straight city driving under the most conservative starts and stops my Enclave gets an averave of 11.7 MPG. I have provided the dealership the gas receipts and milage. The fact is that the 6 speed electrocic transmission holds the car in 2nd gear at 30 miles an hour causing the engine to Tach at a steady 1900 RPM. When the car passes 40 MPH the Tach drops to 1200 RPM. I was contacted by GM's Division Manager who told me that is how the transmission is calibrated and there is nothing they can do about it. I bought this car based on the fuel estimates and I feel that they should be able to produce what they advertise. 31% less.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a 2009 Buick Enclave that I bought brand new in May. I have put 2500 miles on it. I told the dealer after about a week, that I smelled a raw fuel smell inside of the car. I didn't know it smelled from the outside until a friend told me after driving behind me. They tried to say it was the evap system but that smells way too much. The inside fuel smell happens when I turn a sharp corner or come to a stop. My kids, wife and I get sick when we go on a long drive and have headaches and nausea. It is a raw fuel smell. Like unburned fuel. Now even under the Lemon Law, GM won't budge as if I'm making this up. I'll never buy a GM again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Everything that everyone says about how good this vehicle is, is true. The vehicle itself is great, but mine smells like fuel occasionally when coming to a stop. The exhaust tips are super black and I only have 2500 miles on it. I've been to the dealer so many times that I will never buy a GM again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We really enjoy our Enclave. We moved out of a Toyota Sequoia and do miss the extra space and taller ride, however, this Buick is a remarkable vehicle overall. I have only 2 complaints, I am only 5'-9", unlike a previous reviewer I like the footrest on the left side. My problem is either the seat is too short or the seat height is not right for me, I get a cramping sensation in my right thigh, especially after driving for awhile. Second concern is that the middle position of the 8 seater will not easily accommodate a child seat as we hoped. Should have tested that. Overall a great vehicle and fun to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 4 minivans, I had to have a vehicle that offered more comfort and style, but still offered a roomy third row for my teen/tween-aged kids. But I did not want anything as big (and costly) as a Sequoia. The Enclave fits the bill perfectly. It is roomy and comfortable to ride in. So far, performance has been great. I read the criticism about the transmission being slow to downshift, but I haven't noticed anything significant. MPG was another concern, but on a recent trip, I got over 21 mpg (obviously highway). For a vehicle this size, I can't complain. If you are looking for a crossover that combines lots of room with style and comfort, check out the Enclave.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I don't think I have ever owned a car people were so inquisitive about. We drove the Enclave on a whim (actually to kill time while we waited on the salesman to find a Yukon on the lot). Wow! What a suprize! Our past 3 vehicles have been a Yukon and 2 Tahoes. We actually had decided on another Yukon but we were not happy with the ride or the boxy look of the new body style. We drove the Lexus, Infiniti, Tahoe, Yukon and kept coming back to the Buick. I researched and read over 70 reviews. They basically said the same thing. It's a great car! We have 12K wonderful, enjoyable miles and it has been a pleasure every time I have opened the door. I still can't believe I am driving a Buick.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Someone really did aa great job on all of the storage pockets. The 110 outlet is great for charging computer or phone (my daughter though she was going to be able to blow dry her hair...haha). I love the flat folding 3rd row seats. Easy! Lot's of room. Where has electric start been all of my life?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Finally a salesperson listened and found a base vehicle for me to buy. The Enclave CXL FWD compares favorably with our 08 Lexus ES in comfort and quiet ride and has all the equipment I wanted without $$$'s in options. The six speed tranny takes some getting used to and I wish the drivers seat cushion gave more thigh support but this is a very nice vehicle for the money. More mpg would be nice but I think the DI engine will regulate that. At 7,000 miles the car delivers 24 mpg on the highway @ 70 mph.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a Jaguar Vanden Plas and Chevy Astro and wanted a vehicle that combined the best of both. I found it in the Enclave. I now have the luxury of the Jag and the cargo/towing capabilities of the Astro. I also need an AWD/4WD vehicle to get me to my mountain cabin in the winter. The Enclave thus far has proven to be a sturdy, well built, fun to drive vehicle. There is so much about it that I like it's hard to know where to begin. However, of all the reviews I have read no one has mentioned the remarkable turning radius of the vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Absolutely can't believe that I am saying this, but this Buick is the most amazingly comfortable and stylish vehicle we have ever owned. Coming from many Japanese SUV's (Toyotas and Nissans) we had boiled it down to a Lexus RX350, Audi Q5, and the Acura MDX, when we passed an Enclave on the road one day and my wife said... what was that. We were at the Buick dealership 30 minutes later, and after a test drive my wife fell in love. It doesn't even sound right when I say we bought a Buick, but this is no Buick of yesteryear. Way to go GM!</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's been about a month and half so far and I'm really enjoying my new Enclave! We bought it new at 77 mi. and now have over 5K. I traded in my BMW 750il 2000 to go SUV because of the extra seats & AWD for ski season & long distance trips. The only reason I scored lower on performance is because I previously owned a sports car. :) The other gripe is the fuel mileage. It's been averaging about 21 mi. per gallon. I drive approximately 800 mi. per week. Otherwise, we love our new car! </TEXT>

<TEXT>The angle of the headrest tilts too far forward forcing my neck to not be able to be straight when driving. This is a design problem with this car. Another issue is that the cover for the sun roof is a screen only which lets some heat through so even with the sunroof closed you can feel the heat coming through on your head and also heating up the car. I have the basic sound package which is anemic in volume output. There is only one power outlet on the front console. There is a compartment on the dash which looks like it is a place to put glasses but being under the windshield will likely melt them in the heat. I traded a Rendezvous for this and the Rendezvous was actually a sportier drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car replaced a Lexus RX-300 and a Lexus sedan. Our cars were over 10 years old and we really loved our Lexus. I can't believe how great this car is. It drives around town like a dream. I don't think you will need the running board step assist. We have kids and my 5' 3" wife doesn't have any problems getting in and out. This is really well built. The Lexus had some cool - gee whiz features that the Lexus doesn't, but overall I think this Buick better. Good job GM!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>After 7 years without any problems in a Highlander, I switched to the Enclave AWD. Features, past experience (I had two Buicks I drove as Federal law enforcement officer averaging 70K per year without any problems)price and 0% financing, it was a no brainer. I also did some checking on the dealer and found another Enclave owner near where I live and he had very good experience with the dealer. I have had the car now two months and still think I made the right choice. The only thing I could think of to improve would be the mileage, although it comes close to the EPA standard. As of today (June 23rd) I have a little over 2000 miles without any problems. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We came out of the Lexus and wanted something with more room, but NOT a minivan. We test drove so many new cars recently, and saw this car on lot and asked about it. I was cautious because of the name Buick reminded me of my Dad's car. Once we got in the car, I was shocked how nice everything was. The test drive was amazing! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the Interior-Seating is perfect! No Road Noise! Better than our Lexus! I love the mirrors that retract. Trunk space is great once you put the 3rd row seats down.

<TEXT>So far, this is the best vehicle I have ever owned. I was hesitant to even consider it because I wanted the RX350 but my wife heard that this Buick was worth considering. I hate to admit I am ever wrong but the Enclave is by far the better vehicle than the Lexus in every way after test driving both twice (I was really trying to convince myself that the Buick was worse the first time). It gets good fuel economy, has great luxury features I want, safety features have no equal, and is made by the most dependable brand this year! I never thought I would go back to an American car but if they continue to make vehicles like this, I will never leave! Kudos to Buick! BTW...I am 35 in a Buick!?!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I saw the Enclave about a year ago and started my research immediately. Compared to all the other sport looking crossovers, with a three pass third row seat, the Buick has the most standard features at a better or comparable price point. I had a Tahoe, and I loved it, except for the cargo behind the third row, I couldn't even fit a standard stroller back there, so this time I was looking for the passenger room and functionality, and I found it. My kids can easily access the third row. It has all the pretty things that I wanted, to include the dual sun roofs and power liftgate. It looks hot, drives like a dream, and made all my friends jealous! And, you can't beat the warranty! Thanks!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power liftgate, fold flat third row, easy glide access to third row, passenger comfort in all rows, dual sun roofs, sweet turning radius, AWD, turning xenon headlights, I have the cloth interior and it's very nice, inside is cavernous without looking like it from the outside.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> We narrowed our choice down to the Audi Q7, Acura MDX and finally bought an 2009 Enclave CXL AWD (Carbon Black). We truly love the car. Very roomy. Great design. Super quiet. Handling very good for an SUV. The third row comfortable for three. We are a family of four. GM did a good job on this car. This is an excellent SUV Crossover that should be striving to be the best in every category, it has that kind of potential. There is need for some tweaking, such as real wood, better MPG and throttle response/shift adjustment. I would highly suggest the Enclave to anyone looking for a solid, well designed SUV. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Better Buy Buick</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>We ordered our Enclave as we did not want a lot of the options on cars the dealer had on his lot. We have been extremely well pleased for the most part. We travel with our dog and there is room for the crate plus luggage. Last fall we traveled from Michigan to Boston and got 31-33 mpg on the New York Thruway traveling at the 65 mph speed limit. Coming home on both the Thruway and side trips we averaged 28 mph. Don't know what we get around town. We liked the styling inside and out which is what attracted us to the car after doing much research. Two of our neighbors were so impressed with the car they bought one themselves. One of them traded in a newer Lincoln cross over.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We love most everything including Onstar. Have too as we keep our cars on average 10 years. I accepted the dealer's offer to take a tour of the factory and was mightily impressed with the way the cars are built and the technology that goes into not only the product but the production system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First drove an Enclave in September, when I first started thinking of a new vehicle. I drove the Buick, the Acadia, Honda Pilot, Outlook, Highlander and Ford Escape. The Enclave was like steering butter. Oh so smooth. It is a very classy and comfortable vehicle with room to spare. It is unbelievably quiet and the drive is smooth. I bought 3 weeks ago. Got a beautiful vehicle at a very good price and enjoy getting behind the wheel every day!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely love this car. It is the ultimate family vehicle and still offers style and comfort like in an upscale SUV. Pricing is high though, ours stickered just over $50k. We went from a 2007 Chrysler Aspen (full- size) and don't miss any space. Fuel Economy is great, we average about 18 city, 24 highway, sometimes even better! Very Luxurious, after all it's a Buick!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've not owned a GM since my 69 Camero when I was a senior in high school...what a change! I've owned several large SUVs over the past 10 years including a MB GL450 recently. The Enclave is far superior to he MB 350, 450, or 550 and half he price! The ride is brilliant, the pick up is perfect, and the finish is right ON! My family and I love the car/suv..not sure what to call it - crossover:) If you are in the market for a new crossover buy the Enclave as I did the research for months and nothing compares if you require seating for 7 - 0% financing was icing on the cake! </TEXT>

I looked at Toyota Highlander(no 60/40 split 3rd row)and Acura MDX (2nd row of seats do not move adjust for back passagers). I kept coming back to the Buick. This crossover is so quiet, it is riding in your living room. We have already driven it on a long road trip and had no complaints.

<TEXT>First let me say that I drove all the competition (MDX, Pilot, RX350, Highlander, CX-9, etc) and none can compare to the Enclaves combination of MPG, horse power, interior space, and fit/finish. We just couldn't be happier with our new Enclave. It simply blows away the competition. Hopefully it is not too late for GM, but they finally got it right with this Buick. If status appeal of the nameplate is not your top priority when buying a large crossover SUV, the Buick Enclave will be the natural choice.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Red Jewel Enclave</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>The Buick Enclave is a thoughtfully designed vehicle that is beautiful in every way. The exterior styling with the Red Jewel tintcoat is stunning against the chrome finishings. We chose the cashmere leather with cocoa accents, which sets off the luxurious tone of the interior. The Edmund's editor doesn't like the interior 'bling', but we love it. On a recent road trip, we averaged 22mpg. With city driving mixed in we are seeing an overall average of 19mpg, so we are very satisfied with the fuel economy. No other SUV comes close to this one in terms of comfort, quietness and luxury features. My other car is a Cadillac and all I want do now is drive the Enclave (but the wife won't let me).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth is awesome. You can pair 5 phones to the car. Automatically switches to the next phone if the primary on is not present. Turn by turn directions is a great feature. The center console in the 2nd row. Backup camera, and the articulating headlamps, which are so cool at night. Everything!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Came from a minivan so I did lots of research. Was planning on an Acadia, but got a great deal on the Enclave fully loaded. I love all the extra features. It is comfortable, fun to drive - feels sturdy and safe, but hightly responsive. Great turning radius. Very versitile to transport kids and cargo, although slightly smaller that my van. Most of my driving is city, but just took it on a a long road trip to the snow with the family. I love it even more now. Handled beautifully and was very comfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wonderful, beautiful vehicle that handles and rides with ease. Intown mpg so far is 20.7 mpg which is great. Love everything about it especially the driver memory and safety backup camera. Only things that need improvement are more cup holders in front and more storage room suitable for CD's. As a woman, I would love somewhere to put my purse. We are looking forward to some road trips and many years of driving pleasure with this great car. GM Buick has hit a home run with this fantastic car. The foreign cars (Lexus, etc) that are in the same class, well, they just aren't. The Enclave is extremely nice. It has a smooth, quiet ride and can go toe to toe with any of the others.

<TEXT>Last owned GM car was 1960. Since then only BMW, Mercedes and Lexus vehicles. This Enclave replaces my '98 Lexus 470 SUV and does a great job of emulating that SUV at half the cost. Unfortunately, it also copies the 470's poor gas mileage. I now have 3,000 miles on the Enclave, which includes two 1000 mile highway trips. In town I get 13 mpg and on the highway, 19 mpg. This is far from my anticipated EPA 16/22. Yes, the pickup from standing still at a traffic light to keeping up with the traffic is a bit of a struggle and noisy in that initial gear. However, the cabin appointments and general comfort are very desireable. Lots of goodies. Happy with car, very disappointed with mpg. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Having three young boys to drive around to activities, I racked up over 130,000 miles on a Ford Expedition. My husband and I decided it was time to buy a new car. We needed a large enough car to to hold the five of us. And this time I wanted a car with a quiet ride, better gas mileage, sunroof, plus all the bells and whistles. After test driving numerous cars, I fell in love with the Enclave's quiet and smooth ride. My kids love the sunroof, and comfortable bucket seats. GM got it right, right, right! OnStar is fun to use, the headlights, back-up camera,and 19 inch wheels are a bonus too. I test drove many crossover vehicles, and I can't rave enough about this car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar feature allows the driver to press a button and tell the operator the address and they route you. The headlights allow for greater visibility. Seats have lumbar support. Third row seats fold down plus you have the trunk space. The interior is so quiet! Roomy cabin. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a very nice and comfortable riding SUV. GM has always had the best riding cars without all the road noise. Fit and finish is very nice for an American car maker.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated and cool seats, plus the bluetooth and backup camera.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought my 09 Buick Enclave a few months ago and I am very pleased. The styling is gorgeous, the build quality is tight and sharp, and the ride is very comfortable even for a big guy like me. I tried the Acura MDX which is so overrated, the Lexus 330 is another wildly overrated SUV, the Audi, BMW, and Mercedes' comparable SUVs cost 25-30K more and aren't any better. The Buick Enclave has great interior space, just hauled a Christmas tree and wreath to the house with room to spare, and the mileage has been averaging 17mpg with AWD! The engine is strongly reactive and the steering is tight and responsive. The interior noise is practically zero! I've owned a lot of vehicles and this Buick rocks!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet and spacious interior, excellent build quality, elegantly beautiful exterior, sweet handling for a good sized SUV, and good mileage for an AWD.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The ride was incredible the comfort was out of this world. Then the engine light came on. Engineer flies in from GM, to find what he feels is a clearance problem with the head. We had the car for almost two weeks and has been at the shop for almost two and half weeks. He is not even sure a new head will fix the problem. I hope GM stands behind their product. 1,500 miles on vehicle</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior and the accessories are great. Cannot wait to take on vacation.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It has been a long time since we owned a GM car and I have to say that this one is much improved over years ago. The Enclave is very well made and quiet. We get a lot of positive comments on its appearance. We have young teens and just traded in the minivan. Most of our disappointments are related to the fact that this vehicle doesn't have as much room as a minivan and is missing some of the interior accessories you would find in a van.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar is awesome, heated and cooled seats, looks, fit and finish, articulating HID headlights, </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle replaced a van that we really liked. However it is a huge step up. This is the nicest new vehicle I have ever purchased. This a gem that people need to look at. With the direct injection and variable valve timing, I get better fuel mileage than my van. It is well thought out and we enjoy all of the features it has to offer. It is comfortable and super quiet & smooth down the road. I would recommend this vehicle to anybody. My family loves it. Take one for a test drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought it to travel in have not been disapointed. Quiet ride deceiving in will suprise you when running 85 doesn't seem like it. Handles mountain roads well v-6 and 6 speed work well together. Interior comfortable but son thinks door decor cheesey would like wood grain to emulate steering wheel better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Shifting is favorite for son likes manual shifting. The quiet is mom and dads along with sky views. Also the brakes work. Had to shut down hard in mountains 75 to 0 almost smoked the tires but they got us there. The Michelin tires run quiet. Also nice match up.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Performance: Much better than last years anemic engine, but still doesn't have the nice low end torque of a V8. Glad I waited for an '09. Comfort: Front headrest not tilt adjustable. I think this was a new safety law. Second row seats quite small and minimum leg room. Fuel economy: So far very good for a vehicle of this size. Interior design: Nice except for the cheap semi-see through sun roof interior shades and small cramped second row seats. Build quality: Very good. As good as my 2008 Infinity M35. Very tight. Reliability: Too soon to know, but I have had excellent experiences with GM vehicles over the years and don't expect anything bad from this one. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Extremely quiet and attractrive interior. Nicely appointed. Many nice convenience features. Very good ride and driveability. The turning radius is much better than I expected from a large front wheel drive vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Took this on a 5500 mile trip this summer and was very happy.. good mileage and a super ride. Drove 75 (was on a lots of freeways) and got 23 miles a gallon..XM radio was really great as I am a first time user. I have 12,000 miles and it's running super. Took a little getting used to the six speed transmission in town but now I am used to it..</TEXT>

<TEXT>We compared the Enclave to the Audi Q7 and replaced a Yukon XL. My wife wanted something smaller, but that still has a third row. We initially were focused on the Acadia, but kept looking at the Enclave in the showroom and appreciated the chrome wheels and more refined interior. My wife preferred the Enclave versus the Q7 and we saved 13K as well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Third row seat. Gas mileage for this size vehicle. In head rest DVD/LCD screens. Overall fit and finish. Value </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We traded in from a Toyota Seqouia and we are very happy. It rides like nothing youve ever been in. The interior is amazing and very well built. The gas mileage is best in class and it's gorgeous outside and in. A may be a bit slow, but it is very swift compared to all other SUVs I've driven, to which it should be compared. The warranty is unbeatable and new GM are supposed to be very reliable from what ive heard and read about in auto magazines. It's extremely quiet too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, liquid smooth ride, very quiet, great gas mileage for something its size, top notch materials in interior along with excelent fit and finish, and moving headlamps.</FAVORITE>
