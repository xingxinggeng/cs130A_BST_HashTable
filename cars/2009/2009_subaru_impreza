<TEXT>Just a huge disappointment. It's slow (watch as a BMW 3-series can almost out-run you, and a 135i actually can), it has more body roll than an average taxi (watch as everyone almost falls out of their seat when you go around a freeway on-ramp), it has more road noise than an eighteen wheeler, and there's more rattles than you'll find in an average day care center. Buy a WRX and save 10k. I completely regret buying my STI.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought my Impreza in May after putting over 190,000 miles on my 2000 Volkswagen Golf. I feel that the Impreza offered the best for the money compared to the other cars in its class. It may not get the best fuel mileage but makes up for it, in my opinion, by offering AWD. I drive pretty conservatively and have averaged 28 mpg in 11,100 miles. While the tactile quality of the interior may not match that of my VW, the overall design and ergonomics are very good. The Subaru dealership experience that I've had so far, for oil changes, has been very good. Wonderful car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD, nice interior layout, comfortable seats, cargo capacity (can fit 3 sets of clubs in the hatch), keyless entry, minor maintenance points (oil filler, dipstick, transmission stick), storage space and cubbies, and for a 2.5L flat- four, decent fuel mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the car with my work discount, plus end of the year 0.0% financing, so it turned out to be a great deal. I wasn't sure that I was going to like the car at first, because I switched over from a SUV. But I realized quick that I made a good decision. Comparing to my old truck, mpg is not bad, mainly city driving I get almost 25 average. Being 6'2 the car is pretty comfortable with the help of the adjusting seat. I definitely recommend the 5spd instead of the automatic, which is kinda sluggish. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Impreza Outback Sport for a year now. The ride and responsiveness of this vehicle is superb for a smaller car. Interior room and comfort is wonderful, and road noise is minimal. Truly a wonderful vehicle. The only thing this car suffers from is a very poor quality paint. After only six months it had literally dozens of large 1/4" paint chips on the hood and roof, and every time I looked there seemed to be more. Fortunately, Subaru is backing up their product, and it is going in for a new paint job on the hood and roof tomorrow. I wish they would paint the entire vehicle just to make sure the rest of the paint on the car is ok too, but I don't thing that is going to happen.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, comfort, quiet ride. Heated seats, heated windshield, heated mirrors. Great headlights for night driving visibility. Winter driving still feels like its still summer, lol (this car goes great in snow). And the removable roof rack versatility is WONDERFUL. I've traveled with two kayaks on.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Quick, very quick 0-60, and lots of torque at highway speeds. One car mag says 4.7 secs 0-60 and that's not far off, which puts it in a league way above its price. Gas mileage about 24- 25 highway when you can keep your foot out of turbo, otherwise 21-22. AWD grip and handling superb even though the car mags say it is a little soft. Had it since March, got 7K miles on it and have loved every minute.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the car in July. It burns over one quart of oil every 1000 miles. It has soot on the bumper near the tail pipe. Subaru is dragging their feet on replacing it, they want to install a new short block. The oil is dirtier than my wife's car that has 100,000 miles. It's a lemon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been a loyal Honda fan for years but when looking around for a car to replace my beloved 1998 Acura Integra found the Honda spaceship interior horrible. I test drove the Subie Impreza and found an interior that was very comfortable and functional for a 200# 6ft 3in guy (my head doesn't hit the ceiling and my legs have room). I was also impressed with the horsepower and torque (something even the Si doesn't have). So, this formerly loyal Honda guy bought an Impreza 5-door hatch and love it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Another great Subie. I have an 08 Outback and a 09 WRX. Fast?....oh yea! Handles like a rally car and goes in the snow. The best of both worlds, along with Subaru's legendary reliability. Getting on the freeway is always exciting, 0 to 100 in a flash...I'm in my sixties now and am loving the exhilaration of having a race bred rocket, with the drive- ability for all weather conditions. A great value from the folks at Subaru. Gas mileage? If that's a concern, buy a Prius. Purchased with the SPT Cat Back exhaust, Short Throw Shifter and Turbo Gauge.Interior Foot-well Lights are a very cool touch. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration of the Turbo Boxer engine.Excellent braking.Fantastic handling along with a comfortable ride. I'm 6'3" and the seats and leg room are great. Short throw shifter is a must. The sound of the cat back exhaust really hums. Reliability of the Subaru brand. My 08 Outback has never had a problem.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>One month into ownership of my STI, and what a pleasure to drive. Driven hard in the S# mode it is quite the quick sports car, but move into the I mode and it is pleasantly sedate. Owned an E36 M3, 535xi, RX-7, Prelude over the years. This car the best combination of performance and practicality by far. Never considered the brand before, but glad I did. Love the ability to haul people and golf clubs, and the AWD will be important in the winter. While expensive for a Subaru, a great value. Never had so many people look twice before..the scarcity of the car keeps many wondering what it is. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 2004 WRX for a 2009 model year. This is a HUGE upgrade all around. The 2009 has better performance, better comfort, better ride, and better accessories. I optioned for the SPT Catback exhaust system. It really gives the car a nice note. The drone at interstate speeds is a little much. Driving around town, though, it is an awesome throaty growl. The interior space in this model year is loads more than the 2004. My 04 had barely usable rear seats. I love the split fold down rear seats. This is a FUN car. Car and driver tested 0-60 in 4.7 and 1/4 mile 13.5. Those times are on par with the 2010 Mustang GT except you get AWD and better MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In the last year I've experienced a complete engine failure due to spun rod bearing (as have 100's of others US and abroad), driven with an intermittent CEL for 2 months and been to the dealership 4 different times to have the problem resolved, I have multiple issues with the factory ECU tuning including a severe occasional hesitation, and about a dozen other manufacturer defects and dealer workmanship issues including a damaged intercooler, multiple components installed improperly, multiple components not installed at all (missing bolts, etc), and the vehicle now makes a wide array of abnormal noises. Was fun to drive when it was running properly, but trust me its not worth the hassle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I don't know where the EPA got their numbers from, I do mostly city driving and am averaging 28.5mpg on the first two tanks of gas, the motor isn't even broken in yet, I'm sure to get over 30mpg. It's a fun car to drive, definitely good for commuting, the only downside is the amount of wind and road noise along with some rattling of the hard plastic interior. I can't wait for some snow to see how the all wheel drive holds up though, if it's anything like my 92 suby was, it should be a lot of fun. I'd recommend this car to anyone, the 09 impreza has a noticeable amount of more interior space which is great! A+</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my very first Subaru car (2009 Impreza Outback Sports), and I'm loving every minute of it. I've test drove the base model version, and I'll tell you that the Impreza Outback Sports was a very good choice. Also, I've driven the Outback Legacy as a loaner car, and I'm not very impress by the way it drives. Impreza Outback Sports is very fun to drive, very smooth on bumps and pot holes, and hugs the road very well. Although the gas mileage is under subpar, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one. Furthermore, what I really like about the vehicle is the interior room, and the seats are very comfortable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my subie. This car handles smoothly as well as aggressively whenever you need. I test drove an BMW 328, Mercedes C300, Honda accord V6 and Mazda speed 3. Besides this car, maybe only BMW is in my consideration. I nail myself on this car according to the performance and never regret. The fuel economy is better than I expect. I am still in the run in period and mixed city/hwy mileage is around 25-27 mpg. I highly recommend this vehicle without hesitation.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is pretty awesome and gets a lot of stares. It drives smoothly and sounds great, especially the turbo. The price is okay, but I wasn't impressed. The tires are summer performance, I would have liked all- season. The interior is laid out nicely and is built with quality. Some of the carpet seems cheap and doesn't connect nicely with other parts of the interior, the steering wheel has a nice feel as well as other control surfaces. The exterior looks aggressive and confident. People try to race me all the time. The SI-Drive is pretty cool, I keep it in (I) most of the time for fuel efficiency. If you drive nicely it can get good gas mileage, but can also burn fuel quickly with turbo.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turbo, looks of exterior, appearance of the engine, SI-Drive, AWD, VDC, the horsepower, BBS rims, interior layout and quality, NAVI with lots of info on the vehicles status, many airbags, comfortable cabin, roomy and lots of storage, auto climate control, and 6 speed MT (feels solid).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the Outback Sport after convincing myself this model was worth the extra $2.5k. Could have had the base sedan for under $16k but that just had no appeal, unless you are looking for the lowest price. I still have a 2003 Infiniti FX-35 and it's tough to go from a bull to a lamb. Have to remember this has half the power. Big difference getting on to highway, etc. From the reviews I've read here I would have liked the WRX or STI but I needed to keep the price under $20k. Good compromise between cost and performance. I looked at the CRV and Rav4 but to get the same equip would put you in the mid-20's; also don't believe the new ones are as dependable as they used to be.</TEXT>

MPG 22 this depends on where you live, stop & go traffic, driving habits, just try and keep ur foot out of it. Visibility good, except knowing curb local for parking, rolling into carwashes, (rims).

<TEXT>Trucks were sliding all over the road the night I first took a major drive (to pick up relatives at the airport) in my new Impreza. When we stopped for coffee, it was so icy that I could barely keep from falling onto the sidewalk! After my addition of excellent winter tires, the Impreza cruised up that steep, snowy mountain road as if we were out for a summer picnic. Note to anyone else driving on poorly lit two-lane roads: the optional fog lights are worth every cent in a snowstorm with oncoming traffic! Even though it's not why I bought it, I can't help loving the Impreza's amazing cornering abilities; it turns any twisting road into a fun driving experience.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The fulltime AWD grips the pavement like claws without decreasing speed, the brakes work amazingly fast, the engine purrs at 70 mph (the fastest I've driven), the stereo is excellent, the backseat fits three large people, and the trunk pass-through works great for skis.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Took the two week old Impreza on its first road trip. Nearly 1300 miles and pulled about 30 mpg the whole way. A/C worked great in 100+ degree heat. Clutch is still a little stiff, but that should loosen up after a while. I would highly recommend this car if you need an AWD. I live in Tahoe and can't wait to see how it does in the snow. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Great small car to drive around town and a blast on the highway too. You will WANT to pass everyone. And you can. Fast throttle response, not as quick as an evo, but you get so much more car and reliability with the Subaru. Only fault: headlights have a very short cutoff: although highbeams are great. You'll enjoy yourself in this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded in my 2004 Outback Sport for the 2009 because I loved my 2004 so much but it was beginning to cost too much to maintain after 135,000 miles. I thought I was getting a new version of my old car, but this one is like driving a different car and I LOVE it. It's got lots of spunk, gas mileage is decent so far, and just overall fun to drive because it holds the road and doesn't let go, even through rough roads under construction. She feels solid and well-built, and am once again so glad I chose this Subaru model. I've driven Foresters as loaner cars that didn't feel quite as solid with the same level of quick response, and this car is a few thousand $$ less expensive.</TEXT>

With a few parts & some tuning, this thing will embarrass cars costing twice as much! As the engine breaks in, my hwy mileage has increased to around 26 mpg. And this is one of the few small cars that's comfortable for me to drive (I'm 6' 5"). I'm extremely pleased with my WRX!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at way too many new cars before finally test driving this car and instantly forgot about all other cars I was looking at. I bought it the next day. The power and AWD this car has blown me away. It handles like a dream. I have pushed this car in all the weather I can find and have NOT been disappointed. Even when driving this car as calm as I can possibly drive, I still only average around 26mpg, which in the grand scheme of things, isn't too bad for 265hp and 244ft/lb of torque from a small engine. Great car. I highly recommend anyone test drive one who has even thought about the car. Well worth your time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plain looks do not demand attention from police. It looks 'cute' to the ladies and only gets 'oh wow's from every single passenger. The short throw shifter makes driving much more pleasant.

<TEXT>I needed a car that had enough room for two small children (occasionally), AWD for the snow (no snow plows or salt trucks here in the Pacific NW), and I wanted a car that would have great performance (but economical enough for daily commute). I've had this car for 3 months, and I couldn't be more pleased. It meets all my needs (though not tried in snow yet). I keep it in the "Sport" setting, and average 21mpg in mixed driving conditions. Not a single problem with the car. A few additional costs: insurance went up $200/yr and car requires 92 octane fuel, but it's money well spent. Nicely balanced suspension (not too stiff, not too soft). The STI is a very high quality vehicle in and out.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration/cornering outstanding! The sound of the turbo winding up just soothes my soul... Though the car is a performance beast, it is sedate enough in the "I" mode that my wife is comfortable driving the car around. Seats are very comfortable for a tall (6-1)driver.

After researching AWD Vehicles, Trucks and 4WD SUV's, this appeared to be the best choice for me, someone who's always driven a fuel efficient Honda Civic. It handles great! I drove it through the Sierra Nevadas then the Santa Cruz Mountains all in my first weekend. Smooth clutch, super stable around corners and sharp turns. Nice look, comfy and roomy inside. My first and foremost concern when purchasing a new car was safety for me and my child. I feel very safe in my new car, so happy with my purchase!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Only a couple hundred miles on the ODO but so far this Impreza 2.5i has lived up to my expectations. Chassis feels solid and ride quality is great. Handling is top notch and safety of AWD and solid structure gives you peace-of-mind (top safety ratings BTW). The look of the interior and exterior, while subjective I know, are clean and simple. No clutter or weird angles to speak of. I like the added std VDC, full disc brakes, and body- colored mirrors/door handles for 2009. Reliability has not been tested but CR record looks pretty strong. Also like that it's made in Japan. Negs: Interior is too plasticky, fuel economy is sub-par, seat fabric is too retro-fuzzy, and std stereo is not great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my first time buying a new car. I was excited so I researched for months! I checked out and test drove every decently priced compact car I could find. I did TONS of reading on various cars. I settled on the Subaru Impreza, and I am sooo glad I did. It drives so well and I love the blue color. I put in an iPod interface, which I love, because I just cannot drive without music. The thing that struck me the most about the Subaru when I drove it was how nicely it takes corners! I just LOVE owning this car. I have never been a car person but after buying this car I cannot shut up about how much I love it! The fuel econ. was better than expected - around 26-28 mpg city/highway mix.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my new Outback Sport for a few weeks now and have been very satisfied with it so far. I'm still getting used to the different (read: better) handling of the AWD. I test drove roughly similar vehicles (Honda Fit and VW Rabbit) and this Subaru, while more expensive, just felt much more intuitive and well thought-out. The seat warmers are nice and standard on this trim. The fuel economy is better than expected (26-27 mpg city+highway), even this early in the car's lifetime.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Two trip odometers. All the thoughtful standard features on this trim (tonneau cover, rear rubber mat). Excellent build quality. Red dash lights. Grippy AWD that never lets go: I always feel in control of the vehicle. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second WRX. My previous was an '05 wagon. Went into the dealership one day for regular maintenance and walked out with my '09 WRX. The salesman didn't have to work too hard. This is by far loads better than my '05 and that one was very fun to drive. For the price this car has it all. I've got almost 4k on it and not one bad thing I can say. MPG is the same if not better than my '05 that was smaller displacement and less power. I've been averaging 23mpg combined city/highway, with a heavy foot at times, and around 29-30 highway. If you are even thinking about getting one you will not be disappointed. You can't go wrong. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>For sure the power. VDC gives even more traction in snow. Interior is very comfortable, and for prior subie owners very familiar. Did I mention power. Very good mpg even with a heavy foot. Its nice not to have to downshift on the freeway to pass someone, power is instant even in 5th at low RPM.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My last car was a Subaru Legacy and it made me fall in love with Subaru. Comparing the '09 Impreza to other cars in its class (Ford Focus, Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, Mazda 3, etc) there really isn't any competition at all. The symmetrical AWD, power, smoothness of the ride... none of the others even come close to an Impreza. And the Impreza was much less expensive too! It was a no-brainer and I couldn't be happier with the car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Symmetrical AWD which gives amazing handling for both sport and bad weather, ride quality, sleek exterior, comfort, mini-blue light to light up the mini-tray below the stereo at night (without being so bright that it's distracting), mileage. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I knew this car would be fun to drive, but I didn't know that I would think it would be the funnest car I think I've ever even been in. I'm a automotive buff. I love to drive cars. I've driven many cars but this might just take the cake. I will admit, there are better looking cars that handle and perform as good as this but... the cost about 10000 more. Not bad for its price. I can easily imagine keeping this car around for a min. of 7 years. Very pleased with the car. Comfort is nice. I sometimes drive 250 plus miles at a time and never think once that my legs or back is getting sore. Mpg average on ten tanks 22.4. Car has unbelievable grip and handling.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance from the engine. auto temp is a very nice to have. Especially when you're lazy. Haha. The whole car is perfect.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the greatest car I have purchased thus far. It is my 4th Subaru, I presently also have a 2006 325i, which I love, but this car is even better than it. It really has everything you could want - AWD, traction control and stability control(in the base model). What other car can give you all that and still be adorable, affordable and have the "cars that drive great after 300000 miles" Subaru name.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'd wanted a WRX all the way back in 02, but got into Sentra V-spec on price. Fast forward 7 years, and my patience was rewarded with the 09 wagon. Overall, I've enjoyed it after a month of mostly 100 mile daily commutes. People seem interested in mileage. On Trip A and B the car has a fuel mileage calculator. I reset trip A at each fill up. Yesterday, was the usual $30 donation to the gas gods. Determined, I wanted to see what extremely mild driving could do for this car's mileage. On the drive in this morning, I averaged 29.7 mpg. Not bad for average speed of maybe 60 to 65 MPH in stop and roll traffic. Not a prius, but not a gas guzzler either. Power is just tap of the pedal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>POWER! Cabin is nice. AWD. Brakes are very good. Smooth gear shifts. Price. Got mine for invoice. Looks. Interior. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Owned 87Accrd, 94Maxima, 97Taurus, 00Accord, and after researching deprec. rate, insurance, cost of operation, and reliability against models like CR-V, RAV4, and Focus I decided that Impreza make a very solid pkg, and after I test drove it (2.5i prem and GT)I decided that I'd go for real value: Outback Sport (seat warmer+17" alloy/ raised susp. > sunroof+2 xtra spkr). GT was a nerfed version of WRX, and if I am ready for an WRX I'd go STI anyway. Overall I really liked VDC; it gave the already phenomenal AWD feel an extra polish and ctrl. But it will be tough for your brakes as it will brake harder than you'd intend to, road noise is also slightly more noticeable than top compacts I tested.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned many cars in the past. My previous car was a Lexus ES300. I do have to comment that I do not miss my Lexus one bit. The Impreza 2.5i is fun to drive, responsive, sporty, and economical. I live in the midwest, where we get our fair share of ice and snow. I have owned my Subaru for 5 days now, and can safely go places I never could go before in my Lexus. For a base model, it has a great build quality, there are plenty of features, it is much quieter on the road than the Ford Focus, Toyota Corolla or Honda Civic, and when you factor in the AWD it becomes a no brainer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The symmetrical AWD is out of this world. The car is extremely responsive, and safe. I love the average miles per gallon gauge that is based on your tripometer. Great gas mileage, comfortable and well appointed interior. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Impreza is sort of a middle between focus and RAV4 and then it has a class by itself. The fuel economy could be better but it was a trade-off to AWD. What caught the eye first is the interior finished with better grade plastic, and chrome accents, leather wrapping are a nice capping. Fuel economy is ranged between 20-26 mpg pending on your driving style (go easy on that pedal and use some hyper-miling techniques). Interestingly the car looked like a lowered suspension version of Lexus 400h with Corolla-esque lights. I struggled between premium and sport, finally decided 17" + taller susp. > sunroof. Road noise is slightly higher to other cars I test drove.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seat warmers. Hatch + luggage rack = 44+ cubic" cargo. AWD + VDC + lowered, flat boxer = sticks to the road and hugs the corners. Styling int & ext. Higher suspension + 17" alloy = more cross terrain capability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Subie, also have an '08 OBS. This gets about as good mpg as the 173 hp auto in the OBS. I've gotten as high as 29.4 on the road and generally get over 27 even with occasional passing bursts. Town seems to be in the 23 range. Very happy about this. I've owned most everything performance wise, Vettes (2), BMW, Porsche, Audi's (3), Mercedes (4), Lexus. This is my 63rd car and it is a real winner for a fraction of what I've paid for some other iron. No it doesn't have Porsche precision or BMW steering, or the finesse of an Audi, but it gets the job done on par with any of them and it's loads of fun I'm sold on Subaru. Car and Driver article sold me on the WRX over the STI. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SPT, Catback exhaust... delicious sound, short shifter, light years improvement over the '08, great power and torque, good handling in the twisties in spite of soft and compliant ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Coming from an 04 Acura TSX, I was looking for something a little sportier and this fit the bill perfectly. 24k for a car that'll run mid 13s in the quarter, mid 20s for mpg, and have the utility of an AWD wagon (I live in New England) is unbeatable. I considered the MS3 and even the Cobalt SS but FWD on those was a major drawback. Plus the Cobalt looks like a Cobalt. The 08/09 MY Impreza wagons are the first Imprezas I've cared for stylistically (the rear of the sedan version is hideous IMO). I just broke the 1k mark but I've opened it up a few times already and man, the power is a huge improvement over my Acura. Averaged 25.5 mpg in single digit temps on a recent road trip too. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, AWD, color (Blue Mica), MP3 capability on the head unit (probably not a big thing these days but it's new to me), um... 0 - 60 in 4.7 seconds</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought my Subaru in September 2008 and have already put over 6000 miles on it. It is safe, reliable, and fun to drive, especially with the 5-speed manual. It handles great in the snow and off-road and is great to take on trips. I have not had one problem and am very satisfied with just about everything. I drive the car roughly 100 miles city and 320 miles highway on an average tank of gas and get close to 28-29 MPG every time (with an average highway speed of 75 MPH). The car does not have the power or the luxury of my previous one (a BMW) but is an awesome point A to point B car. Subaru should adjust gear ratios from 4th to 5th gear as the car seems sluggish when entering 5th gear.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD, exterior and interior styling, cargo capacity, smoothness of the ride, and the 5-speed. Reliability is also great. The engine is strong and the car is well built.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am former Lexus IS 300 owner and wanted a similar sporty sedan. I am utterly impressed with the value this vehicle provides. I like how this package has everything you need without needing to purchase any extras for increased costs. Reasonably priced Japanese built car with amazing performance and decent looks. You cant go wrong and throw in the AWD while your at it. Pound for pound this blows my IS 300 out of the water with much greater value. The interior was nicer in the Lexus IS 300 but thats it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning (and loving) my Acura RSX Type S for almost 7 years I sold it and bought the 5-door WRX Premium. This car is almost perfect in my book. It's all there, utility, comfort, features, power, solid build with sex appeal. Any criticisms I have are minor at best. It's a thrill to drive. I highly recommend this car if you're even considering it. Nothing else out there equals it in its class. Pictures don't do it justice. It's a must see and must drive. And if you have the cash spring for the STI version. That's even faster and more aggressive looking.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car about a month ago. At first I was a little unsure about it since the WRX is also very appealing. I have grown used to the car though and have found it really fun. It doesn't accelerate like the WRX, but it handles curves like a champ. And I get around 24 mpg in Houston traffic and 28-32 mpg on the highway depending on how fast I drive. I get lots of comments on the car too... most call it "really cute." I have heard a few things about the radio, but I've found that it plays nicely with MP3s. FM and AM bands are not as clear though.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Practicality w/ small size, great handling, heated seats, interior styling, turning radius, radio when playing MP3s, seats five in relative comfort.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was shopping for a new car, and looked at the 08 STI among others. Waited and test drove the new 09 WRX and felt that it fit my daily driving needs much better. Don't get me wrong, the STI is still a beast, but the updated 09 WRX with 265 HP, better suspension, etc, and some STI looks in the grille and rear spoiler make the WRX a great purchase for most daily drivers. Great handling and smooth power so far. Expect easy maintenance and good reliability. Interior fits well and looks good, just some hard plastics here and there, nothing bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The first Subaru I owned was a 2007 legacy. After almost one year, the realization that the legacy sedan doesn't meet my family needs as the wagon we previously owned did. The 2007 legacy is an outstanding vehicle and it was painful to trade it in, but now I have the 2009 Impreza Outback Wagon and I don't regret the trade in the slightest. In the 2009 Impreza Outback Wagon, the driver visibility is much better. The seats are firmer and more comfortable, providing support where it's needed. The controls are wonderfully placed so that you need not take your eyes off the road. And to my surprise, the ride is smoother and more responsive. I'm completely satisfaction beyond expectation.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Driver visibility, seat comfort, accessibility/placement of controls. The storage area below the AC/heat controls is wonderfully lit with a soft blue light so you can see what is there at night, yet not too bright to distract you. The hood and trunk have lifting cylinders (no need to pull/prop up).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has it all. With the back seat down, and they go flat, surfboards and snowboards fit perfect. Making it a perfect two person surf or snow adventure, no chains either :) Looking over the build quality its quite nice and I'm impressed. The ride is quiet for the most part, little or no rattles. The performance is amazing, to accel as you go through those long half circle off or on ramps, the car feels like its on rails. It's so quick, hitting 80 mph in about 5 second. The stereo, not the best, but not to bad either. Mine has the six CD changer with MP3 compatibility, which equals about 1020 songs on tap, not bad! Turn the bass all negative, mids and treble all up, plus my SUB ='s : )</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Big brembo brakes, engine of the year award, BBS rims, nice seats, the 6 speed gear box and tranny, the looks, the ride, spark silver, the power, the interior especially at night, cold ac, the quad exhaust, the solid feel as you drive. This car is stealth big time! This car looks in person, sexy</FAVORITE>
