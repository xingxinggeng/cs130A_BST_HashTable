<TEXT>After looking for more than 1.5 yrs for a smaller SUV that didn't look like a woman's car I kept coming back to the Outlander. Only had mine for 2 weeks but it's proving itself the right vehicle for me. After 2+ years of not driving a 4WD SUV I had to get back to what was right for me and my dogs. This vehicle is spacious especially with the back seat folded forward. The fuel economy is better than I had hoped after only 2 weeks - averaging ~24mpgs combined. Handles well, can't wait for snow - actually I can wait forever for snow but by Lake Erie in northeastern Ohio it won't be long. A little hard to keep clean, the interior attracts and holds dog hair. Wish I had all leather interior. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It baffles me that I don't see more of these on the road. Every time I tell someone about my new car, they've never heard of it. But then they see it and they love it! I researched vehicles in this segment obsessively, while I waited for the Cash for Clunkers deal to go into effect- I had been driving a '99 Jeep Cherokee for the past 7 years and when the A/C broke, it was time to go. While I never considered myself into features (the Jeep had hardly any), I am amazed at how many features I got on the Outlander for the price. Far better deal than any of the competitors. After 2 months of driving I can proudly say that I have absolutely no buyer's remorse. Love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auto lights (daytime running, headlights when it gets dark), auto windshield wipers (knows when it's raining, speeds up when it's raining hard), bluetooth is awesome, love the FAST-key (great to not have to fish for keys in my bottomless purse). Great storage space and sound system, good visibility.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My car is 1 month old and performed flawlessly on a 6100 x-cty trip (mostly on I-70). I was a bit skeptical purchasing my first suv, and had to purchase the smaller engine thanks to cash for clunkers, but this model is the perfect fit for my lifestyle. I love the "sun and sound" option, the rear door opening and "tailgate" and overall space for the "stuff" I cart around. I love that I can fit my bike inside, although I do have a usable rack if needed. Other storage room and cup holders are more than adequate. For the money, this is a great performing vehicle. Down the road some of the interiors "plastics" may pose a problem, but I can easily accept that. The 168 hp is adequate. Would rec.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>As above; the "sun and sound system" option rocks. Little things like the "touch" turn signals, dash and rear storage, and the tailgate 200# "seat" capacity make life much easier. Loading, unloading are a breeze.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased this Canadian version model LS AWD V-6 and realize it is the Best SUV that I have driven! It is so smooth and comfortable on the road, you think you are driving a sport sedan. You don't even need to floor it when passing 3-4 slower vehicles on the highway, it surges with such authority and speed...the engine revving sound will please your hears! Consumption: Did 9.6 litres for 100 kilom. on the highway at around 110-115 kilom. Love this truck!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, Power, smoothness. AWD with Locking device option. High ground clearance (Very important here in Canada) the sunroof and warranty.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had been researching several SUV'S and this one just stood out to me. I really enjoy the drive although it is a little noisy. I love all of the storage compartments as well as the storage available in the back,. It is made for tall people to ride in the back which is good because most of my family is tall. I love it, can't wait to take it on a trip to really test it out. I am really surprised I don't see more on the roads.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The warranty, the cost, the special 1.9% financing for 60 mo. The space available. The ride is really good especially for the money. They should push these vehicles more than they do.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Best all around crossover/SUV I've had (priors: Jeep Cherokee, Mazda Tribute, Hyundai SantaFe). Poor low end torque & city gas mileage. Good highway gas mileage; outside size/interior room ratio; responsive & tight handling. Excessive tire & wind noise on Highway. Good & plentiful electronics are intuitive and well thought out; steep learning curve to use efficiently. Same for 2nd & 3rd row seat positioners. Hard to see instruments & Nav in bright sunlight. Lots of front glove box/misc & rear storage space. Great warranty; no problems in 8 mos of ownership. Used paddle shift once in 8 mos. Overall Impression: Utilitarian yet fun to drive, super value for money. Would buy another one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall utility, non city gas mileage, sound system, auto down & UP drivers window, amount of driver information, setable electronic features, FAST Key system, backup camera, bluetooth, rain sensing wipers, exterior size/interior space ratio, setable AWD system, warranty</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After a lot of research on Edmunds about the Outlander I decided to go to the dealership- after test driving the SE- I fell in love and the following week bought it (not NEEDING a new vehicle). I was driving a '09 Civic Si and was growing tired of a manual. The Outlander is one of the sharpest looking SUV's I've seen and the room inside is amazing. My salesman was 6'4", 240lbs and with the front seats all the way back- sitting in the back seat his knees did not touch. IMPRESSIVE!!! The price was great for everything I got including the extras. I am very pleased. Only had it for a week and immediately packed it up to go camping- exceeded my expectations.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Blue tooth, 6-mo free Sirius, Black cloth w/ leather trim interior, room, stylish look, easy to drive, fantastic turning radius, sound system, comfort, & for only $700 more- extended the already awesome warranty for bumper-to- bumper to 10yr/100,000mi, not having to pull out my key to get in and out</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this outlander ES (FWD) base + Conv. pkg in Black on 28 June 2009. This vehicle runs great and performs as expected or better considering that this is a 4 Cyl engine. Fuel economy on a 70 mile straight highway was about 29 mpg, and my usual driving of a 20 mile trip (80% Hwy) gives about 25-26 mpg. There seems to be a very faint buzzing sound, I need to look into that. Lots of cargo room, and comfortably seats 3 avg. adults in the back seat. Seats are nice and firm and are very comfortable on long drives. I am happy with this purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Daytime running light, firm seats, lots of storage, great warranty, considering that this is an SUV and is only 4-cyl, this vehicle is relatively quiet, good MPGs (especially if you drive carefully).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Outlander. I've had it for 7 months and have just about 10k miles on it. It was awesome in the snow with the 4wd option and has plenty of clearance. I love the smart key! The stereo is exceptional and I love the 6 disc cd changer! The only thing that makes me a little crazy is the air leak noise when the sunroof is CLOSED. This vehicle is fun to drive and easy to maneuver. I wish I would've purchased the V6 but I was being careful with the gas mileage. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sun roof, smart key, stereo, 4wd/Awd.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been driving this vehicle for about six weeks and absolutely love it. Was deciding between the Nissan Rogue and Outlander and glad I made this choice. For all of the features and options, the price point could not be beat. The exterior is extremely stylish! The interior is decent as well. The dash materials are so-so, but I use protectant cloths to keep them clean and scuff free. Having two glove boxes is great for storage. All of the cup holders and extra storage places are a bonus! I have the third row seat which is small, but convenient. When the seat is folded, you can't beat the cargo space. I made the right decision on the 2009 Outlander and highly recommend it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Extremely stylish exterior, hands-free bluetooth and "bumping" stereo system w/Satellite Radio. Also love the "smart key" feature--never have to take out the keys!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first SUV. I needed more cargo space than my sedan could offer. I test drove the vue, equinox, escape, journey, nitro before looking at the outlander. This offered everything I was looking for and really enjoy driving it. I like the steering wheel radio controls, the in-floor storage (I don't have the 3rd row seat). I like all the safety and stability features. The 4 cyl is good, but because I have a lead foot could use a little more get up and go. I have to still get used to speedometer on left side of the display. Offers great warranty. Gets good gas mileage for an SUV. Great safety ratings. Not sure why you don't see more of them on the road. This is a great SUV especially for the $$.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fold flat tail gate. 2nd row seats have great leg room. 3 glove boxes, great sound system. Lots of cargo space, cup holders that hold 20oz bottles, stabilizer bar, stereo controls on steering wheel, has a nice exterior look. Good gas mileage, good safety ratings, great price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drive 30,000 miles per year in all kinds of weather. I needed cargo space and 4wd. This was the most reasonably priced, least ugly vehicle in this category. I never buy new, but finding something with low mileage would've cost me close to what this cost me new. I don't expect luxury in this price range - and I sure didn't get it, but it's decent looking, inside and out. I'm not thrilled about the velour cloth seats, I don't think they'll hold up. Dash and side interior panels are a weird textured rubbery material that seem to mark up fast. Maybe some protectant will fix that.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth. I'm averaging between 26-28 mpg, which I'm happy with. Smooth engine/tranny. Warranty. Price (23,700ish, sticker, which I did not pay). Lots of glovebox storage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The outlander has exceeded all my expectations. I chose it for the technology features like the navigation, music server, sound system, and backup camera. None of the competitors had anything even close in its price range. Driving is smooth, quiet, yet powerful.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The keyless entry and ignition is my favorite unexpected feature, I never have to take the key out of my pocket. The auto wipers and headlights are a nice touch. I love the backup camera, Music Server and DVD playback. The cargo room is perfect for my needs.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second day with this "CUV" and can tell already (as long as no problems come up) that it will be in the family for at least the next 5-6 years. It's comfortable, rides smooth, and it has all the space in the world as far as cargo. We test drove the comp. (rav4, santa fe, equinox, forester) and this was it - the Outlander took the prize.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the outlander after test driving rav4 and crv. I like the outlander looks and its price of course, unlike rav which I believe is overpriced. Honda crv is better in acceleration, Rav4 is more car like when you drive. Outlander is heavier, but more stability in curve although a bit slow during start but can be faster if you use the techtronic options. Overall it's worth the money compared to Rav4 and CRV. Forget about resale value - just enjoy driving it... no regrets.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased my wife the XLS AWD w/ navigation. After reading a lot of expert reviews I was skeptical. But most of the complaints were that the V-6 was slow and the interior was really cheap. I would agree that the interior is not the most expensive materials used, but they are lighter weight and help reduce the total weight of the vehicle. We have no complaints with the engine, I mean it's not a dragster and it has plenty of pep. I am 6'04 and am able to sit in the back seat easily even with the driver seat all the way back. The stereo and navigation system are awesome, truly. Very hard to beat Mitsu's warranty and safety rating. Much bigger than it looks. All in all, great lil SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>LED brake lights, Stereo and Navigation, Self adjusting Xenon Headlights,overall space inside, 40 gb hard drive for storing music, came with extra all weather floor mats, towing package and trailer hitch, rear camera with warning sensor, hands free bluetooth etc...</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted a small SUV for under $25k that excelled on looks, warranty, standard features, and Edmunds Editor's Rating. Of the 10 vehicles I compared, the only one that landed in the top 3 on all 4 of my lists was the Outlander SE. Then I test drove the Outlander and the Honda CR-V EX, which is often regarded as the leader in this segment. The CR-V is more refined (quieter engine and ride, nicer interior materials) and has a better 5-year resale value. But I was swayed by Outlander's equipment, warranty, and appearance. As for resale value, by that time I'll be 70 and have bigger things to worry about. Bottom line: This is a nice vehicle, especially if you don't need a plush interior.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Unbeatable warranty, sporty feel (almost 5 in. longer than CR-V, chrome rocker panel molding, sharp 18 in. wheels), satellite radio, keyless ignition and entry, superior audio system, roof rack, prewired for Bluetooth.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>2009 ES in red and black interior - 2wd My wife loves this SUV. Did not need extra stuff like 4wd or navigation or high end radio. Handles great, good mpg, looks nice. Rides very smooth on highway. Radio works well, plenty space for five or six. Tailgate is nice feature for loading and unloading. Car feels and looks more expensive than is was. Interior looks sharp. 10 year warranty.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>10 yr warranty powertrain. Tailgate access. Red paint is sweet. 16" tire. Alloy wheels.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had the car for three weeks now. The car feels much more like a sports car then a small SUV! The suspension is very tight (as the reviews say) but I think this makes it feel like a low slung sportster. The seats are comfortable. Just love the way it drives. It is a small SUV though (we came from a Jeep Grand Cherokee) but has nice styling. Has enough power for fast acceleration. Very happy with the car so far.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Driving experience. Amenities (got the sound and luxury package). Relatively inexpensive. Looks good. Fuel economy (compared to my 06 Jeep which got ~17MPG). Unlocking doors without needing a key is a new experience. Selectable 4WD. Speaking to the car (bluetooth) to make a call is bizarre.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my 09 Outlander for 2 weeks now and it's great. Handling is very good, I like the steering. Navigation is good but sometimes complicated to use, stereo has great sound strong bass. Fuel economy is just ok, but I expected that, I average around 23- 26MPG (highway). I enjoy driving it to work and all the features work great so far, glad I decided to buy it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>FAST key, navigation, Rockford Fosgate stereo, heated seats, HID headlight, music server</FAVORITE>
