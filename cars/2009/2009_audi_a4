<TEXT>I purchased an 09 Premium Plus and found the seats to be super uncomfortable. So uncomfortable, in fact, that I ended up trading it in with only 4,000 miles on it for another '09 A4, but this one had the sport seats (M3-style retractable thigh support bolsters)and better shoulder support plus paddle shifters. Night and day. While I could never get quite comfortable in my Premium Plus I was immediately very comfortable and have been for the past 16,000 miles in my Sport package model. The only issue is that from what I understand Audi has discontinued the "Sport Package" and now only offers the better seats in the S4. Something to consider- you will not like the stock seats if you are 5'10"+.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for almost a month with 1300 miles on it. It is an awesome car with excellent driving dynamics. I can hardly believe it is a 4 cylinder, but I'm reminded of it when I idle the engine with the windows down. I returned a leased 2007 Lexus IS350 and at no point did I feel like I downgraded although this vehicle was $7000 less. The interior room is cavernous and the ergonomics are superb. Acceleration is amazing for any size engine not to mention for a 4 cyl. The Bluetooth integration is excellent as it reads your entire phonebook and makes accessible at your steering wheel controls. The front end with the LED Running lights makes this car spell luxury.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2002 A4 3.0 Quattro on a lease on a 2009 A4 2.0 Quattro. This 2.0 has plenty of torque. Cannot tell the difference with the new V4 from my prior V6, except the gas mileage is better and it is a quieter engine. I ordered the Premium Plus package with the navigator. I love the voice activated bluetooth dialing, the voice activated navigation, etc., and the backup camera with guidance. Audi came up with a winner. I am getting over 33 miles per gallon on the highway and around 28 in the city/suburbs. I am very happy with the vehicle. I loved my 2002; but, this is a big improvement. Only thing I miss from the 2002 is the storage compartments under the front seats.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth phone, navigator, and radio can be controlled by voice. Very smart looking dash and console. The extra room from the previous model makes a noticeable difference.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We get many compliments on our S-Line Cab. Great looking S4 wheels. This is our first convertible and we love top down driving. The Cab is fun to drive but not BMW thrilling. Like the fact its an AWD car, for full year use. Fit and finish is excellent, interior is gorgeous. Gas mileage is terrible. Hope long term reliability is good. We leased, but buyout is very attractive. If it holds together, can envision a long term ownership.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Quite frankly, it's hard to be ambivalent about $40k purchase, but I have to be honest with myself, and 9 months after purchasing this car, I can't say it's changed our lives. It's solidly built, but there's a fair amount of road noise. For all the self- congratulation from Audi about the increase in size, it's really not all that roomy. I think my wife's old 2001 Jetta had more room in the back. The MMI might be good compared to options from other manufacturers, but it's hardly intuitive. In sum, it's a solid but not outstanding effort.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling: sometimes the size feels awkward, but no matter the situation, you're always in control. Thank you AWD. Also, it's nice that key comes apart so you can take just the metal part with you if you're going for a run or a swim.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The performance is great with sports mode, but the suspension is a bit bumpy for my taste (I can feel every road bump), but I guess that's what you get for a more sports tuned suspension. Fuel economy is not bad for a 211hp AWD car; I'm getting about 30 mpg on the highway and average about 25 highway/city driving. It is definitely a fun to drive car with very tight turning circle. Interior and exterior design earn many praises from my friends. The problem is I'm getting the shimmy around 62 mph (hence points off in reliability) and the diagnosis from Audi Engineering is bad control arms. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that replacing control arms will cure the shimmies.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the Audi for 2,500km so far. It is amazing. Fuel efficiency is great for a car with this much power. The 2.0 is more powerful than the 3.2 for the first 100km (60mph). I have the navi and tech pkg. Everything is voice activated. Back up camera is very handy. Proximity sensor locks and engine start are very convenient. EPS is nicely engineered. Audi side assist is handy. Seats are very comfortable. Breaks are high performance. I tested the Lexus IS250 and the BMW 328xi also. I have heard "Hey man nice car!" from over 10 people in 3 weeks. So that covers the exterior design. Red Bull must be more popular in Germany than North America (one of the cup holders is small). </TEXT>

<TEXT>Car is everything I expected. Fit & Finish is as good as it gets. So good in fact that the seams trunk to body are so tight you can't fit bike rack clips in between. Engine is smooth. Test drove the 2.0s not going to pay this much for a car that vibrates 3.2 is for me. Brakes are awesome. Keep your eye on the rear view in a panic stop. Tiptronic is fun. Quirks... The ipod interface is poor, I leave my keys in the car in the garage but not with this... the lights will not turn off, the homelink does not work until you turn the car on. Kinda dumb that you start the car before you open the garage door. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased two days ago and drove over the weekend. Car is beautiful inside and out. Handles like a dream. Very comfortable. Virtually all functions are automated. Using the MMI takes some work, but once you get the hang of the info entry process, it works for most of the different functions. Several reviews stated that someone shorter than 5'4" might have some problems with the driver's seat position. My wife is 5'2" and had no problem getting into a comfortable driving position. Back seat has enough room and the trunk is large for this class of car. I would recommend test driving the 2.0T, as is performs quite well. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Front seat comfort. Acceleration with the 2.0T is good (for a normal driver anyway). Steering is sharp on hard corners. Lots of gadgets. LED lights are a new wrinkle. Sirus radio and IPOD interface add options for entertainment. Bang and Olfusen stereo systems is well done.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had the car about 7 months now and no major complaints, except for the wind (see below). The A4 drives well, though it's not quite as responsive as well as my 2006 BMW 5 series. Steering is tight, brakes are just a bit grabby, and power is strong. The AWD is the best, especially in heavy, slushy snow. The only complaint is that the wind buffets incessantly my face when the window is open. Poor wind engineering. And it's difficult to find a good open position of the sunroof so it doesn't make noise. Seems like it has to be readjusted for every speed level.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Both front seats proved to be uncomfortable during long driving periods. The problem is that the seat's side support bolsters are so high and firm (firmer than all other luxury cars of the same class) that they provide undue pressure on the hip bones. The outside side supporting plastic exacerbates the situation by noT allowing any amount of downward give of the seat. Thus, when exiting the vehicle, the plastic support and firm bolster provides undue pressure on legs. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Audi A4 for one week now. Excellent well designed car. Sharp styling with excellent design/fit and finish on the interior. MMI is really slick. Performance on the 2.0T is excellent - strong pull due to high torque. No problems with the CVT thus far. Exhaust note gives a good growl when accelerating. Pricing right now has been really good too!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just picked up an Aruba Blue,Premium Plus with Navi and wood trim. My wife has a 2009 Cab (older platform) for about a year now. I love driving it so much that I shopped the end of season sales for a sedan for me and found a great deal. I was driving an '04 Accord with 100k trouble-free miles and had no desire to give it up. The Audi's driving dynamics, power and smoothness of the engine are great (even vs. Cab) and gas mileage is quite good. It's also the perfect size I was looking for. The gray interior is beautiful. The MMI is awesome as is the bluetooth and stereo. Seats very comfortable as well. If reliability is on par with the Honda, this will be the best car I've ever owned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine is awesome - much smoother than wife's 2009 Cab and 258 ft. lbs. of torque at only 1500 rpms! Ride is very communicative, comfortable, and quiet. MMI is very good, even though it is slightly more tedious than Honda's. Bluetooth works great with both of my phones. Interior is beautiful. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is simply stunning, especially from the outside, especially with the Prestige package I got. Handling is very balanced, ride is sporty yet comfortable for longer commutes. Quattro provides excellent grip and 2.0T is powerful yet fuel efficient (have gotten 35 mpg cruising). Plus, this car is as big as the Passat I traded in. Some downsides include having to get Prestige to get those stunning 18" wheels and 4 cyl. a little course when revved hard. But overall, I loved my choice for my first luxury brand car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car was leased for my wife. I owned a TT with a manual transmission a few years ago and we were attracted to this car by the excellent lease terms, appearance and the previous experience with Audi. The A4 has been back to the dealer twice in 3 weeks. The first time was due to wind noise and a water leak in the space between the front and rear driver's window. That was fixed. The second trip was because the automatic transmission (CVT) feels like it shifts from 1st to overdrive within about 2 seconds, causing significant loss of power. This even happens in sport mode. In addition, there is some lurching and hesitation upon initial acceleration. The dealer says this is "normal".</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling...The car feels like it is glued to the road. The steering feel is great and the suspension feels nice and tight. The Cabriolet with the S- Line package looks great. We get a lot of positive comments. Bluetooth works great. Interior fit and finish is excellent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only owned my new car for about a month and a half, almost 2 months now. The day after I bought it, it had a check engine light on. 3 trips to the dealership in a month and a half later, I got the fuel pump replaced. I'm hoping this problem doesn't continue because I really do love the car. I feel I should relate my experience to others so they can be informed buyers, though. Aside from this inconvenience, I really do like my car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation with backup camera is the BEST! It's saved me from dings and dents already. It forces me to pay closer attention when I back up. Also, I love the design of the multimedia interface and the quality of the leather seats, etc... It just seems more stylish than competitors'.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my third A4 in four years, passing them on to the kids or trade in on lease. The 2009 Prestige is one sweet machine. Better performance than than older (2006 and 2007 A4) with more torque and horsepower with highway mileage 33 mpg level road at 65-75. Also looked at BMW with AWD but run flats and many thousands more $ just not worth the difference, (and I have had BMW 3 series in the past). Great cruiser at 90 mph and around town. It is bigger than older A4, as big as I can tolerate. $37900 with 0.9% and 1 k down a great deal, than 4200 off MSRP, I will buy it rather than lease.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great looking car and fun drive but has one major flaw. If you attempt to accelerate fast from a dead stop by mashing the accelerator, the transmission hesitates for a full second before the turbo kicks in. This can be dangerous when attempting to make a left turn in front of approaching traffic. I was told by the dealer that this is a common complaint because of the tiptronic transmission and cannot be corrected. You simply cannot throttle the vehicle hard from a stop and there is no fix. They said that I would get used to it. Be sure to test drive the vehicle before purchasing. I only test drove mine for a few miles. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Once the turbo kicks in, the car accelerates extremely fast and handles great on curves. I love the looks of the car and enjoy all the other features. The trunk is huge. The daytime running lights are unique. Gas mileage is great. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The commute has gotten a lot more pleasant since the A4 S-Line came in. The Audi is quiet, comfortable, and effortlessly easy to drive. The Alcantara seats are cooler than full leather in hot Louisiana summers. MMI is easy to use and useful after very short learning curve. The steering wheel scroll buttons make dialing phone numbers, radio surfing preset stations easy and safe. The daily commute is a 70/30 mix of highway (65-70 mph)and stop-n-go traffic and the Audi delivers an amazing avg 28-31 mpg with mindful throttle (depends on traffic, weather). Despite the 19" wheels and summer perf. tires the ride is firm without being jarring (test before buying). Gorgeous and feature laden.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was a previous MINI Cooper S owner and was looking for something else that was fun to drive. I spend about 2 hours of my day commuting and the Audi A4 Quattro 2.0 with the Premium Plus package fits what I need. It has fun and comfort. I'm a big tech geek and the A4 meets my needs. My favorite feature has to be the MMI. I had this car for almost 3 months and it has been excellent ever since except for a few strange rattle noises coming from the doors. It's a big head turner... so be prepared. I have had people in the freeway cruise up to me on the next lane, just so they can turn their head to view the led lights. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My car choices when searching came down to the BMW 335 sedan, Lexus GS 350, and the Audi A4. I decided to purchase the A4 based on the features and price. The A4 has the quattro AWD, fold down rear seats, 14 speaker Bang and Olufsen system, bluetooth and navigation. I felt that the exterior styling and the better interior features of the A4 outweighed the engine performance of the 335i. The Lexus rear bumper styling just didn't grow on me. So far after driving the car for the first 1000 miles I am so happy about my decision. The A4 is fast off the line and pulling on the freeway in sports mode, the handling is great with the quattro, and it's very eye catching with the LED driving lights.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our first experience with Audi came after my wife turned a triple 360 on a slick road in an Acura TL. For our next car purchase safety and engineering were at the top of the requirements list. After a 2002 A6, 2002 TT Roadster, and 2007 A4, we took possession of a 2009 A4 2.0T Quattro with Premier Plus option package. The improvements in the 2009 A4 are impressive and reflect Audi's continued excellence in engineering. This model, with it's increased length and width, adjustments to the engine mounts to reduce the vibration in the 2.0 four cylinder engine, and the tweaks to the acceleration off the line make us feel like we're back in our A6. Roomy, feature rich, rides on rails.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I previously owned an 06 A4 with all bells and whistles in it and I loved the car. When it was up I got an 09 stick premium plus model with sport package and nav, and the car is amazing. The sport suspension really gives the car that sporty feel and the summer tires make the car hug the road and handle amazing. This car also has more low end torque which works really well when getting onto highways. The 2006 model was more sporty, but with the sport package it makes this car a great mix of sport and luxury.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car for the winter weather performance, blend of fuel efficiency and power, stunning appearance, and advanced safety and technology features. Those the car achieves these easily. Living with the car for a while, I would love to give it back. The primary drawback of the vehicle is the very rough ride over 50 MPH. The vehicle seems to transmit every nuance of the road surface into the cabin, the seats, and the floor. The suspension is just far, far too firm. Riding on rougher roads is continuously distracting, with tiny road imperfections intruding into an otherwise palatial experience. I urge anyone considering this vehicle to do an extended test drive. I wish I had.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you're the type of driver that wants to look forward to getting in your car, this Audi fits the bill. Our A4 does not have the sport package so the steering and suspension is not as stiff responsive as let's say an S- line Audi, but the ride is a smooth as can be (which my wife prefers). This car is a real standout in the rain, extremely stable which I attribute to the Quattro. Haven't driven it in the snow yet, but I imagine it will perform well. The seats are comfortable and the steering wheel feels great on your hands. Plenty of trunk space. The bluetooth telephone is seamless, hop in the car and the car takes the call. iPod attachment works great as well. Daytime running lights.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Audi to replace my 2002 A6 2.7T. I like the look of the A4 so chose the Avant version for practical reasons. I must say that it's such a joy to drive this car everyday that the commute to and from work seems almost tolerable. It feels sporty even without the sports package. Even though the sports package moves it further up the performance ladder, the ride is a little too jarring for the road I drive on. An added bonus on this car is fuel frugality. I am already averaging 25.5 MPG over 1,300 miles (1/5 city and 4/5 highway driving). </TEXT>

<TEXT>After months of study and countless test drives, I chose the Audi A4 quattro over the BMW 328xi and the new BMW 335d. As a previous BMW 3-series owner, I agonized over the decision. However, I cannot be happier. After owning it a few weeks, it has exceeded my high expectations. It is truly an incredible vehicle, with the perfect combination of all the options I was looking for. After initially considering the base (premium) model with the add-ons I wanted, I ultimately opted for the prestige model with all the toys. The icing on the cake is that I paid thousands less than a comparably equipped BMW with better mileage. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth and powerful 2.0 Turbo, quattro handling, awesome i-Pod connection with the MMI, back-up assist camera, keyless start-up, incredible stereo (Bang & Olufsen premium sound), LED headlights, lane change assist</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had previously owned an A4 (2000). I remembered the fun it brought, so I thought I'd give it another chance when I began my car search. I also tried all the usual suspects. This was simply the best bang for the buck. I went with the Premium package with AWD. You don't need anything more than that. I read many reviews by other readers and I agree with the positive vibe on this newly improved model.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car is well balanced with AWD and the 2.0 engine gives great performance with very good gas mileage. The interior feels like a jet cockpit. The increased vehicle size was a great idea that was much needed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted a German sedan and test drove the big three. Hands down I was the most impressed with the Audi A4. I went with the 2.0T because it has more torque than the V6! Very responsive and I am getting over 30 MPG on the highway! The MMI interface was better than the other two systems. Hunted down a 2.0T in Black with a Prestige package. I wanted the 18" rims and the Bang & Olufsen Stereo. The Audi's interior looks rich while the others' look cheaper. The rear seat room is much better in the Audi.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Bang and Olufsen stereo is by far the best car stereo I have ever heard. The sound reproduction is awesome. Having the iPod interface as well as an SD card slot means all my music comes with me. The front end styling is unique and aggressive. The Smart key technology is cool.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Audi purchase after many years of Volkswagen ownership and so far I am loving every mile of it. I chose the Premium Plus and 18" Sport packages. The seats are very comfortable and all controls are easy to use although I find using the MMI creates an extra step to do just about anything except adjust the radio volume. As typical for a German automobile, everything is placed logically. The steering wheel is weighted nicely but the paddles on the back of wheel are too small to make good use of them. I placed my order 10/08 and would have preferred a M/T but the timing just wouldn't work for me to wait that long. Other than that I can't really complain.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My trade was a 2006 A3 sport that I had for 2.5 years. I liked it so much I wanted to see what else Audi had that was just a little bit larger, more comfortable yet just as much fun to drive. The A4 Avant Sport was it. Options I got: Premium Plus, Sport, Navigation, Rear Side Airbags. This car is unbelievable. The BMW 325xi wagon cost $8k more for the same equipment but had a cheaper interior and didn't drive as well. The Infiniti EX had sub-par interior quality although it drove great. However, I'm not going to apologize to my back seat passengers as they trip getting out of the car (small back seat and door opening if I'm buying a $44k car and I would have to do that with the EX).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior quality and ergonomics is the best - hands down. Exterior is subtle yet sporty. The MMI is very intuitive. Sport seats are awesome. The car drives great and is very responsive. Sport suspension gives a firm ride, but still very comfortable and luxurious. Open-sky sunroof is fantastic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Living in the Snowbelt had a dilemma which car to pick. I was looking for manual and 4 wheel drive, turned out that there are not many options available. The instance when I sit- down into Audi, realized that I like this car after the test drive I felt in love with it; signed the contract hour later. If you are looking for great looking comfortable car which can pump the blood through your veins go with A4 manual ? BEST CAR on the market. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Previously owned two 6-cylinder Jaguar X-Types. The Audi A4 ride is fantastic; the 4-cylinder Quattro engine is very powerful. Tiptronic manual shift is fun (but dangerous-- must be careful to avoid speeding ticket)! This vehicle is beautiful, roomy, and hugs the road. Because it's low to the ground you have to be careful when parking, so the front end isn't damaged by concrete barriers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked at the Infiniti G37 and BMW 3 series before settling on the Audi A4. Owned an A6 over 10 years ago, and wasn't sure if we we'd buy another Audi, but the A4 has bested all my expectations in the little time I've had it. Didn't need AWD as we have a SUV at home, so I got the FWD with Sport package in Premium Plus trim. Car drives beautifully, hugs the road esp on turns, sounds great, and the LEDs turn heads for sure. The MMI is very easy to learn and the AMI and Bluetooth work like a breeze. The extended length also comes in handy. The next few years will tell me how much they've improved the Reliability but so far so good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've got the diesels and I bought one 3 weeks ago and traded my 2007 BMW 328i. It looks great, the interior is beautiful and the ride is nice and comfortable without being too 'sloppy'. The BMW was my first and last - the ride was horrible. This is as powerful, the auto changes cannot be felt, even in sport mode unless you really look for it - I'm old and like smooth! There is no perfection but this car is excellent in every way. The diesel engine does clatter but you can't really hear it from inside except when you accelerate and then it's only a bit of noise - like noisy tappets on an old car. Great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>...A4, previously owned 2007 2.0T Q sport/Sline/Ti. Current car (2.0TQ prem+ w/sport pkg) is what I was hoping for when I 1st purchased an Audi, slightly better performance than before, much better handling, much improved seats (highly recommend sport pkg option). Feels like an adult's vehicle. Complaints: only re plastic dash piece (hope for aftermarket cure soon) & wish it still had a full size spare - minor stuff really. Very anxious to see how this is chipped, 2007 was a big difference, 2009 promises to be better. Bottom line, I love driving this car... so does my wife.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning BMW's and Mercedes (2 lemons in a row), this is my 1st Audi. It is awesome! Very comfortable, wonderful variable steering, great electronics. I am impressed by the 4 cylinder turbo; quick acceleration, especially when down shift to the "S" mode (passed 5 cars on 2 lane country road-WOW!). We take it on the Interstate every weekend while our BMW 330 sits in the garage. Gas mileage is 24 around town and 27-30 on highway, depending on how I drive. The 2009 A-4 surpasses my expectations. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car for about 5000 miles so far, and probably would not buy it again. There's much I truly love about the car but the commuting ride quality on worn roads is very harsh, especially here in New England roads where the car is useful in snow. Since delivery car has real vibration 70 - 80 MPH. I've seen others talk about this, and dealer has not resolved. I plan to take it to an independent tire spot. Speedometer seemed high, and reads about 4-5% higher than actual speed when calibrated with GPS. 77 MPH shows as 80 or 81. Racking up extra miles if you leased! Car is good from stop lights, but 2.0T feels underpowered with highway onramps, etc. Requires "S" mode and a heavy foot.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sticks like glue to the road, and is simply stunning to drive in snow. I have driven nothing better. Striking, handsome exterior and modern, sharp interior.

<TEXT>I swapped a Tundra pickup for this wagon and love the car. Best combination of size, performance, and practicality on the market. Wonderful handling and when the turbo kicks in, breathtaking acceleration. Lots of features and techno gadgets even in the base model. As can be expected from Audi, top notch interior build although the gray metallic plastic around the instrument panel seems cheesy, why didn't they just use the aluminum trim like in the rest of the car. The radio controls take some getting used to and the steering wheel audio controls frustratingly don't let you scroll among preset stations only. This car is a looker and gets lots of attention, a top choice among wagons!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turbo acceleration, Quattro handling, interior build, full of features, great looking car, highway mileage 27mpg at 80mpg, roomy enough for 2 car seats and a stroller, great looking car and not many of them on the road so you get lots of attention, reversible cloth/plastic cargo floor a nice touch</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Original post- 09/28/08 Car remains a blast to drive- stereo remains a favorite, bi-xenon lights are worth extra money. Significant difference in driving in S mode and super fun on twisting roads. Car handles fantastic in winter (installed winter tires & with all wheel drive - go anywhere as along as snow drifts aren't too high) Car is low - watch out for curbs & cement stops in parking places! Overall am very pleased with purchase after 4 1/2 months driving - you still want to go out just for the heck of it! What could be better - more horsepower (?), ride over bumps could be a bit smoother (but then you'd lose the sports car feel). Just a great car! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I got the A4 with Premium Plus, Nav and the Sport Package in Quartz Grey four months ago. The styling of the A5 caught my attention and when Audi applied it to the A4, it when to the top of my list. Beautiful interior with Aluminum Trim (not cheap plastic like my Chrysler) with plenty of leg room all around and the layout is excellent. The Engine has plenty of power and the brakes are amazing. The ride is a little stiff with the Sport Package and 18" low-profile summer tires, but it tracks around corners fast and flat. Sport seats hold you in place and are comfortable on long trips. Safest car I've ever owned. Thanks to Edmunds for supplying loads of info towards my purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the car, it is quiet, low road noise. But, it burns oil. At 600 miles I have had to put in a half quart already. Furthermore, you would think for a car that burns so much oil, it would come with a dipstick, but, it does not. I wish I would have researched problems like this before buying. I do regret my decision now, oh, and for Audi, the current oil consumption is within their limits so, I drive with oil in my trunk at all times.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After two Corvettes, I decided I needed something more practical but still fun to drive. The Infiniti G37X was a little too small and too stiff and the 328xi a little too expensive. The A4 was just right. It handles well and accelerates nicely with the turbo 4. I don't think the V6 adds much more. It holds 4 people comfortably. I wouldn't go for 5 unless 3 are very small. The trunk is huge. The interior is handsome and the sound system is fine. This is my first experience with BlueTooth and its much better than OnStar.</TEXT>

The turbo has excellent giddy-up, and the extra foot lbs. of Torque give this car plenty of pop of the line and set it apart from any other seday in its class. The Audi MMI can be challenging at 1st, but once you get the hang of it is very easy to use. I love the ipod integration (a must for me) and the bluetooth phone feature that downloads your phone book. The new body style provides plenty of room in the back for my 3 year old daughter.

The interior is beautiful and made with high quality materials. Every button and every dial feels great to the touch. The back seat has enough room for even your biggest family members.

I was also used to keyless go so this option is now a must have for me. Finally, the side alert is a great feature and my mirrors tell me if someone is in my blind spot with a flashing light.

This car is fun to drive and I expect Audi to improve on its interior functionality in the next few years. For us larger drivers a better designed front seat would be appreciated.

<TEXT>I love to drive this car. It's the Prestige with nav and drive select. The handling is unbelievable, combined with a truly solid ride and plenty of power. I was concerned at first whether the car would have sufficient power for my lead foot, but it certainly does, especially in sport mode. You just need to punch it -- with a turbo, one needs to use more pedal than with a non-turbo 6 cyl. The gadgets are wonderful: Nav, bluetooth, Sirius radio, backup parking beeper and camera. The Bang & Olufsen sound system is fabulous, worth the extra. I took the car on a 3000 mile trip. One barely notices getting to high speed, very solid, esp. with dynamic mode. Radar detector needed!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drive Select-distinct softening in comfort mode, nice for town. Dynamic really tightens up the handling. Sweet on Mulholland Drive with all the other yahoos in their BMW's and Porsches.

<TEXT>This is an update from my previous review. We got some snow here and I was able to test Quattro system much more than on wet pavement. I confirm that without ASR, handling is exceeding my expectation! I feared that the electronic would limit my fun, but I'm very pleased by the latitude granted by my A4. And with ASR, I know my wife will not be in trouble when driving in the snow. Also, I got my Ipod cable and can confirm that Ipod integration is flawless. I use playlist and store over 350 CDs on my Ipod. Can navigate with ease and of course, sound quality it excellent.

Bang & Olufsen stereo blows all other audio systems away. A great option included in the prestige package along with keyless entry, push button start, stop. Side assist, rear alert.

<TEXT>Bought the A4 2.0T Quattro with the premium plus package. Great exterior styling, good interior, good fit/finish, almost great handling. This car is quicker and better handing than the '99 A6 3.2 I sold. The low-end torque makes it responsive in commute driving, loads of fun in the hills. Getting an honest 30+ mpg on the highway. The trunk is roomy, and the split fold-down rear seat ads versatility some of the other sports sedans lack. The LED daytime running lights turn heads.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine performance and exterior styling are great. The Bluetooth cell phone link is a good feature, and the Infotainment system is easy to operate.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got the premium plus package with navigation. I've had the car for a few weeks and absolutely love it! The symphony style LED headlights are my favorite, everyone notices them. The 2.0T engine has plenty of power, I wouldn't want the 3.2L. Audi has done it again!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>LED headlights, navigation, new sportier exterior styling</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Mine, ordered in May, was in the very first shipment. Compared to my twin turbo 2001 A6, it's a only a bit smaller in the rear seat but very close in the front with more headroom and a larger trunk. While a bit slower of the line to 30, it is faster to 60 than my old twin turbo A6 and definitely a better handler. Have 3000 miles already and just got back from a 1500 mile trip. Very comfortable despite a somewhat stiffer seat than the A6. Overall, very pleased.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, braking, MMI and the incredible B&O audio system. Looks great. The daytime friving LEDs are a really nice touch - gets lots of looks. Love the smoothness and sound of the 3.2 V6 and willing to trade a few mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have the premium plus pkg with nav. This is the best car I've ever had. Easy to drive and so much fun. Handles turns extremely well at fast speeds. The gas mileage is pretty good, getting 22ish city. I love the "smiling" lights and how they look during the day and at night. I've never felt so safe and comfortable in a car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation/back up camera and overall design of the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great car for the money. Just bought this car for my wife, looked at BMW X6 - seats only 4? 3 series SUV I wasn't impressed with, I drive a 335i and we needed a winter car. Front end, very aggressive styling and they did a better job with the back end too. Enough for 5 people, dogs and luggage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>LED lights under headlights, very nice styling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the A4 Premium Plus about 2 weeks ago, and all I have to say is that it is absolutely amazing. I had looked at BMW, Mercedes, and Lexus, and this car defiintely blows them all away. End of story. The handling could not get any better; it is even better than the 2008 Audi A4. The steering is very precise and adapts to how fast or slow you are going. The ride is quiet and smooth, making it a very comfortable car. I could see myself sticking with Audis in the future. Even though the price can be high for some buyers, all I have to say is take a test drive and you will see that you get what you pay for. The car is amazing. I would not change a thing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2009 A4 Quattro with Premium Plus less then one month ago and I simply can't stop driving this vehicle. It's fun to drive. Turns heads (Daytime Running lights). Simply looks great! Awesome build quality. That is just the start of the reason I love this vehicle. As usual the folks from Audi have done an outstanding job of designing and building this vehicle. The tolerances are very tight, the materials are high quality, and overall design theme is stunning. I've never really been excited about a vehicle until this car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Audi Music Interface works great, the Ipod integration is fantastic as is the bluetooth connectivity for cell phones. I love how my contacts are downloaded right into the vehicle so I can easily dial without ever lifting my hands from the wheel. My favorite feature? All of it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned various BMW's & Audi's over the past 15 years, and this seems to be one of my favorites. I just ended an X3 lease and was considering the 328xi wagon or the A4 Avant. To my surprise, I chose the Avant with the Premium Plus Package, because they really made a lot of advancements since my 2004 Audi. Until BMW redesigns the 328, the Audi 2.0 I think is a much better car. It handles great, it's feels much quicker than the 328, and the interior and exterior design (at least on the Avant) is a real winner. So far, I think it's a no brainer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The MMI is very cool. The 2.0 is much better than I thought it would be. Handling is very crisp. I can really throw it through turns. Seats are very comfortable. Seems to get pretty good gas mileage. Finally, being a wagon, there's lots of cargo space. Why would anybody choose an SUV</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I picked it up 2 weeks ago in Aruba Blue. Love the car and the color. I test drove several cars before decided on A4. You can't compare beautiful interior & exterior designing with any other car in its class. When turbo kicks in you feel you are drving on the race track not on a highway. Love the MMI, bluetooth and iPod features. I love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great pick up, awesome interior, great sound system & MMI.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had this car for three weeks and I have nothing but good things too say about it. Stylish exterior with just as beautiful interior. Acceleration and power feel much better than when I tested the 2009 TSX which is also a four-banger but not quite as responsive as the other competitors that have a V6. Safety is pretty much on par with everyone else as well but Quattro is a big plus since that's the only real fulltime AWD in its class. I like that automatic not only has a manual shift mode, but also a sport autoshift that lets the car stay in lower gears longer for more power. All in all a real eye-catcher inside and out that gets decent MPG for an AWD and has just enough zip to have fun.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All new styling and increased HP, torque, MPG, and room than the old model. Trunk also big enough to fit my golf clubs and much much more.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had the car for 3 weeks and 600 miles of driving so far. I got the Premium Plus trim with Navigation and I'm really loving the car. It has the exterior looks, interior styling/finish and performance that make it the true triple-threat. For a V4 turbo, it delivers a consistent torque through the RPM range making it a pure joy to drive coupled with the excellent all- time quattro AWD. The interior is Audi at it's best with an excellent MMI system - for all intents and purposes is the same interior of the more expensive A6/Q7 models. Everything is designed to make the driver's job as effortless and enjoyable as possible and I have no regrets whatsoever in purchasing this car. Recommended</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance of 2.0T engine is excellent while still giving great gas mileage. Interior styling, finish and technology is same as more expensive A6/Q7 model. The LED DRLs are unique and attention grabbing, add personal flair to the car. Rain sensing wipers/auto headlights make effortless driving</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased the new A4- significant improvements over previous generation. Tested Mercedes C class, BMW 3 series, Infinti G35, Lexus IS before deciding on Audi. Vehicle has premium pckg, Technology pckg, B&O stereo system. All options worth the extra cost- stereo is wonderful, MMI much easier and intuitive than BMW, steering is very crisp, engine is very good, transmission very smooth, shifting in manual mode is great! As expected, interior is best in class and extra length to car has resulted in much better back seat space than previous versions- tall people will still find back a bit cramped though. Save money + stay with base engine- turbo is great!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, transmission, steering, brakes are all great. Stereo is awesome- car looks great (white/black) and new headlights work and look great! Seats are comfortable as well</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had been researching the '09 A4 since March 08 - I ordered it in July and picked it up 2 weeks ago. The car is everything I'd hoped for. It is beautifully redesigned with a sportier & elegant lines. The headlights are making heads turn on the road!! The trunk is spacious; interior is luxurious and roomy. I debated on waiting for the 6-speed manual, but decided to go with the 6-speed tiptronic. The response is quick with a very smooth shifting; excellent acceleration. I have the premium plus package with navigation/back up camera option. There are abundant features included in the premium plus package; I also added the navigation package which included the MMI.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MMI: I love the interface which controls the bluetooth, iPod (Audi Music Interface), navigation and audio selections. Best part is I don't even have to take my phone out of my bag. It picks up the contacts in my Blackberry so I can dial right from the MMI!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wish this car had better MPG. That's my only complaint so far. It's competitive with others, but I'm finding closer to 26/27 on the highway versus 30/31 as dealerships tend to suggest you'll get, rather than the numbers listed on the window. Then again, who trusts car dealerships. I find the front seat very very comfortable and since I do a lot of highway driving, this is a big plus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Of course my car is new and I'm so happy and exited about my choice; but I did test all AWD cars in that segment, then chose A4 for the style, size (bmw too small), quality of the interior, ultimate sound system. Handling, fun to drive is great! Performance is more than enough for me, but lack brute force of G35x or BMW335xi. This is the only item for which the A4 is not getting perfect score across the board. B&O sound system is a marvel! Way superior than previous Bose option. And with the SD card support, I even don't need to use CD (6 disk changer, MP3 support). It comes with ipod integration, I'm expecting the ipod cable delivery soon and will provide feedback on it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy for a 6cyl, it's great! Handling in corners. Sound system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The new A4 is an all around excellent auto. It surpasses all others in its class and then some. Wheelbase is similar to the MBenz E-class. Style is literally a jaw dropper. Acceleration 0-60 is better than my 225hp TT which was 6.3 sec. Im guessing the A4 3.2 quattro is similar to the A5 3.2 rating of 5.8sec 0-60, not the 6.3 posted on the Audi website. The exhaust sound is deep and throaty. Braking is quick with minimal nose dive. The best feature is the steering feel. It's very light and nimble. Interior and exterior finish quality is top notch. I test drove this car at Infineon raceway a few months ago and couldn't wait for its arrival. A well equipped A4 3.2 quattro for $40k, what a deal!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The A4 3.2 quattro is fully loaded and well worth the extra $4k. Seats are heated and/or cooled. The LED daytime driving lights are a big attention grabber. The best feature is the steering response.</FAVORITE>
