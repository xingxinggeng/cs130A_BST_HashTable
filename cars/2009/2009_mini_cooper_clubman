<TEXT>We bought our Mini Clubman S new about 6 months ago. My other choice was a new V6 Accord, but decided on the Mini just because I wanted a change and better handling. Overall, I love it. It's surprisingly roomy inside for a small car, We have a 4 yr old boy and it's perfect - thats why we opted for the clubman. The Mini has more noises than I can identify, but that becomes one of it's charm. The clubman is not a "pretty"car, but I think thats what I like about it. Only regrets are the "pleather" seats; they are too hot in the summer. The stereo is not that good either, but I find I am less interested in what I am listening to and more interested in the drive. Definitely Fun and different!</TEXT>

<TEXT>At the risk of revealing that the emporer has, well, not all his clothes, I'll say that my new Mini, an automatic, has scary hesitation when you floor it from zero. The automatic tire pressure sensor gives false alarms, so the local dealer wants me to pay to fill the tires with nitrogen. Don't put barefoot kids or anything delicate in the backseat floor because the runners that slide the seats are incredibly sharp, exposed metal. They punctured a 2L soda bottle recently. It got under the carpet, and the dealer wanted $900 to dry it out, claiming no fault because cargo belongs in the cargo area (duh? but sharp metal is ok for people?) My auto body guy did it for $300. Keep shopping!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ride is much better than I had heard. Plenty of room for my 6'1" frame. I got one of the last 2009's off the lot because of the great end-of-year financing. I'd love to custom build my next MINI, though - the options seem endless. Originally wanted an S hardtop with 6-speed manual, but I'm glad I got the Clubman with automatic. I drive around with the sport mode on most of the time. I'm 61 years old, and don't remember enjoying driving this much since I was 16. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>handling, surprisingly compliant ride, build quality, feeling of a premium brand for less than 30k, I actually like the quirky controls - it makes the MINI more endearing, barn door boot, smiles I get, engine growl reminds me of an English sports car, body style, fuel economy.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Love this car</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>People told me that it would be fun to drive but it exceeds all expectations. I love getting in the car every single day - driving has never been so much fun. Great handling, fast and gas mileage! I get (average between city & highway) 41 MPG (the online computer says I get 43 but I do the math and it's comes out to 41.2). We regularly use this as the family car because my kids love to ride in it - fit 4 people and 15 bags of groceries just fine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the second Mini I currently own. My wife took the first (a 2007 cooper base) after falling in love with it. We took the Clubman on a 2500 mile vacation trip (a bit hesitantly since there aren`t that many dealerships cross country) after purchase and it performed flawlessly. Loved driving every mile! The service at the dealership is awesome and their customer service is one reason why I purchased another mini. I gotta admit, I do like the clubman better than the mini...feels more stable. And the turbo is exceptional. When the Mini 4 wheel drive debuts in 2010, we`re gonna look at that. Overall, the mini is a great riding, handling vehicle. Love the shifting with the 6 speed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling and power are great. I have the cloth seats in the Clubman which are very comfortable with me being 6 feet tall and about 200 lbs. No problem with driving the 2500 miles. Aside from the usual features, I really like the brake/clutch feature..not letting the car roll until clutch is up</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this Mini, I got it in Hot Choc color, and lounge leather lounge leather interior,with cream accents. So far I don't have any complaints, and don't expect I will either. The barn doors make loading a breeze. I have liked mini's for a while but they were just not practical until now, I love the extra space, and once the seats are folded down its surprising how much you can get in there!! The ride is alot smoother than the regular cooper. Does not quite corner as a regular cooper, but I'm not a race car driver either.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car when gas was pushing $4.50 and quickly learned to forget about the gas crisis. I generally get 430 miles to a 13 gallon tank before I start looking to fill up. In slower traffic, stop and go, it can get a bit punchy. That being said, it is the most fun I have had driving a car. I haven't had any real problems with the size of the car, it fits anywhere and with the clubman's back doors, everything fits. The clubman S has a lot of power and when I'm not paying attention it surprises me still. I get quite a bit of attention in parking lots as people always are scrunching their eyebrows coming over to look at it. Learn to keep it clean b/c of all peeks in the windows.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The gas mileage, 3rd door and back loading doors are my favorite features. I'm not sure I would be able to do a regular Mini Cooper.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my mini clubman!!! When I went to the dealer to buy the cooper I quickly realized the space in that car was going to become an issue in the future. I opted for the clubman for that reason and boy am I glad I did! It still is really fun to drive and the extra space is really a bonus!! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The speed and stability have to be my favorite things on this car. Also, the double sun roof is a great addition that makes the ride more enjoyable!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When fuel was at $4 plus and I was driving a big GMC Denali something felt wrong. I began looking for a fuel efficient car that was fun to drive but also provided the utilitarian features of my truck. I found it in the Mini Clubman. Outfitted with a roof rack system from Mini this car has taken all I can dish out. Mountain biking, road biking, camping and hauling hockey equipment back and forth to the ice rink has not slowed down this car. In the sport mode the umph is exciting and shifting the gears is fun. On long trips with three people the car is still enjoyable. A fourth makes it seem a bit cramped. At 6'2" I'm quite comfortable driving this car that makes heads turn.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Shifting gears and ability to fit all the life style equipment in the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fantastic car, runs best on premium gas though, this is a fun hi- performance car for reasonable money , has a 3 year full maintenance package included, and the final and 4th year warranty covers all the major components.... look this car is fun, fun, fun! Great around town, sharp and powerful on the highway sips gas, feels very well built, has a 5 star crash rating, club door works well, reasonable rear seat room for adults, no really!! Looks sharp, has all the latest technology, good brakes, good visibility, nice feel to the controls. I highly recommend this stretched MINI cooper s clubman.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powerful motor , powerful brakes, radar detector * needed, good feedback thru steering wheel, agile little car, no vagueness - love it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in an F150 Pickup so this was a big change for me. No regrets. With the rear seats down, I can get 2 guitars and a bunch of other stuff in it so what's not to like there? Real adults can ride in the back. Wouldn't recommend that across country but around town, not too bad. I wish I could get the high 30's MPG that others are reporting, however, 30.8 average for 8K of all kinds of driving is not bad. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling. It's much bolder than I am. Power is exceptional. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My lease was up on my 2006 JCW Royal Gray Cooper S with 38,000 miles. I was a little apprehensive about the change from a supercharged 210 HP to turbo charged 178 HP engine but not believe there is not much difference other than saving $7K for the JCW upgrade. The new 2009 Clubman S arrived 8 weeks after ordering and it much better than I expected.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>39 MPG, Did I mention 39 MPG?, More room than the 2006 model, very quiet and vastly improved seating.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What are you waiting for? If you want to have fun and most of the standard features plus unbeleivable fuel economy (400 - 500 miles per tank ~ 13 gallons) this is the car to get. I call this is a hybrid (fun & fuel economy). I got the basic model - yet it has pleasing features all around. It has leatherette seat, more than necessary electronic controls, cool audio (the base stereo is better than my other three cars), quiet engine, engaging transmission, and lots of complements from every one. The car gets impressive miles in the summer (37 in the city & 42+ in the highway) with aggressive driving. This car invites you with electronics, also turns on necessary lights in the dark as you exit.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Six speed transmission, sport mode button, quiet engine, comfortable seats, club doors, impressive fuel economy, and performance. If you upgrade to the S model or higher, you will lose comfort, quietness, and fuel economy. Great dealership - customer oriented.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Clubman has given us a practical reasons to have a fun car. My wife has been wanting a MINI for years. With two kids, that wasn't happening...until the Clubman came. We have a 4 year old and a 5 month old. Car seats and entry and exit are no problem on the passenger side, thanks to the third door. Behind the driver's seat is a little tight, but basically a non-issue. After driving it for the last few months, I kind of wish we got the S. But the straight 4 cyl does well in almost all our driving conditions, except when I want to really push it up a hill from a stop. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auto climate control, heated seats, bluetooth phone capabilities, sports mode that makes accelerator more sensitive and steering more stiff, double moon roof, auto wipers. And of course being able to run corners like the proverbial go- cart that the mini is always compared to. 33mpg in town, 40 hwy</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After looking at this car, the Jetta Sportwagen and the Mazda 3, I ended up getting the MINI. I got only the Premium package and the cold weather package. Added 16" wheels (15"="clown car") when the dealer gave me a deal on a set they had in the warehouse. In short, the car is fun to drive. Handling and braking are outstanding and the base model has enough power for most situations. Once you commit yourself to revving it higher and downshifting when required, the power is adequate. It's been reliable through the first 4,000 miles and have averaged 32mpg in traffic. Other cars are more practical but MINI is selling fun as much as they are selling cars and in this area it delivers. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, braking, sunroof. Rear "gates" make loading a breeze. Didn't get a lot of add-ons as it is easy to inflate the price to idiotic proportions by adding optional equipment.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Minis are viewed as city cars, however except for the looks, it's a poor city runabout: just try opening those huge heavy doors in a tight parking space! Steering is heavy. Pedals are heavy. Handbrake is heavy. Gearstick is tight. Worst, the engine is so coarse - my wife initially thought it was a diesel! And too slow for Boston traffic flow. Moving it through stop-start traffic is a pain. Turning circle feels surprisingly large too. However it all changes once you get above 30mph. It's an absolute joy on the highway, and through the turns it feels like it can take any curve at any speed. At 2,000 miles, been to the repair shop 3 times already. The dealer's very nice though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far so good. After 4500 miles no issues and the car has surpassed expectations. This really is the perfect city car. Easy to park, good on gas, fun to drive, and can be made to accommodate your stuff or your friends. So far very pleased with purchase. Only shortfall is the brake feel. The JCW is more performance oriented version but the brake feel is too touchy for spirited driving. The brakes feel like they grab too much even with slight pedal pressure. Easy to upset balance of car. Stopping power is excellent with the 4 piston front brakes made by Brembo. Good car. Take the plunge you fence sitters.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun factor in an everyday useable package.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving an Infiniti FX-45 for 4 years, when gas hit $4 I got tired of 13 MPG. I wanted something sporty, unique, and borderline practical. A regular Mini was too small, but the Clubman was love at first sight. I'm 6'4" and it's as comfortable as most full sized cars. It is a blast to drive, a definite show stopper in parking lots, and is averaging 26/35 MPG. I just wish someone had warned me that Minis are like Harleys - the initial purchase is just the start, then you become obsessed with everything Mini! Oh well, everybody needs a few vices in life.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is absolutely beautiful. We owned a 2004 Mini and never had any problems. We purchased the 2009 Clubman base model and personalized it. The upgraded stereo is worth the money, the heated seats are an absolute joy. The car has a "Sport Mode" that is a lot of fun to use. It's nice to have the extra room in the back and the barn doors are just great. We can actually bring our adult children with us now in the rear seat. Mileage is about 28 M.P.G.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I had been shopping for a small economical car with some pizzazz for a couple of weeks. We had ruled out the Mini Cooper because of the backseat and lack of traditional storage. We had been looking at Japanese cars, none of which fit her requirements, when we heard of the new MINI Clubman. She did an Edmund's comparison online and was intrigued, so we headed out to the dealer where she fell in love with the S model. We diligently made our choices online and ordered her baby. Just picked it up after 2 1/2 months waiting, it was worth it to her. She hasn't stop smiling.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun factor, driving characteristics are tops. Bluetooth, stereo, convenience package and other electronics exceeded my wive's expectations. Xenon headlights work wonderfully. Seats very supportive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Always wanted a Mini but felt the back seat was unusable. Clubman is the perfect solution. Just as economical and fun to drive but with room for four. Have to fight my wife for who gets to drive it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling is excellent and fuel economy is great too. Hard to find both in one vehicle. Start/stop button is a cool gimmick. Barn doors make loading easier. Mood lighting also a cool feature.</FAVORITE>
