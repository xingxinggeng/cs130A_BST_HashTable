<TEXT>This car is surprisingly comfortable. Handling is superb: better than my former S2000, STI, Speed3, and of course, Mustang GT. Very easy to drive, even for the novices. Clutch is soft and easy to play with. The gear box is good and smooth but i think the S2000's one is better. Power is linear. Not fast like the STI or the Mustang GT but who care? we cannot use all that power around town anyway. So, i'm ok with my R3 and it's fast enough for me. Smooth, smooth, and smooth engine! no vibration whatsoever when rev it. It sounds very good. This car is unique like no others. It's fun to drive and the bottom line is i just love it more than all other sports cars i had in the past (don't know why).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, very stable at any speed, easy to drive, wonderful gear box, comfortable for sports car, smooth and sweet engine sound, unique, special, classy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car for my wife after her Stratus got totalled in a 7-car pile-up. All other cars we looked at were all the same. Line any brand, make or model up on a football field, and they're all the same 'boxy' car. I bought this one for her because of style, then engine, then performance. GAS MILEAGE? You've got to understand this engine. Due to its rotary nature, it all boils down to a 6- cylinder, 2-stroke engine. Typically, 2-stroke engines have never had much power until you reach a speed above city street speed, and fuel consumption matches. You can drive this car at 80 MPH in 3rd gear (yes, auto also) all day with no problems. Never slides, squeals or tilts much on turns.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine (once you understand it) Handling (FANTASTIC!) Roomy, for a sports car. Doesn't slow at hills at hiway speeds, like most cars do. Style - Just 'weird' but lovable Ride - Not too stiff, not soft at all Ease of use - The whole console may be reached without stretching, even for short folk</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Disappointed, engine stalls. Also prone to flooding if you drive it for less than 40 minutes - not good news with inner city living needing you to shuffle parking spots. The final nail was a dropped rotor. Reported the performance drop off to Mazda, they "didn't find anything". Needed a full engine replacement, never again ... and then Mazda Australia comment of "no customer goodwill will be provided". Sure could try the legal route, but have not got the time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Is great car to drive, be nice if it could hold its own in a straight run from the lights rather than just luck pretty - but does corner well. Does not live up the the rx7 blood lines. Plus anyone notice the average age of the people buying ... puts a dent in the ego :)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love driving my RX8. True, it's not as potent as my Speed3, but it is much more fun to drive. I could never take turns and corners in my Speed3 like I do in my 8. I never got to drive an older model, but the R3 is so incredible at handling, I couldn't imagine a boring drive in any RX8. One thing is for sure, the RX8 is my new choice of car and cant wait to see what other improvements/new models that Mazda will release in the future. Judging by the R3 final product, I know Mazda is headed in the right direction. Let's hope they stay headed that same way.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Mazda Rotary vehicle (following a 1988 RX-7 GXL, and a 1994 3rd Gen RX-7), and I have to say I am pretty happy with it. I hadn't planned on getting another car, but my 15 year old 3rd gen RX-7 was totaled almost a month ago :-(, And I KNEW the "8" couldn't match the 3rd gen's stellar performance since the "8" is 300-400 pounds heavier, about 110 less horsepower (I'd had some things done to my 3rd gen) and doesn't benefit from the 3rd gen's 50-some-odd better low end torque (compliments of that sequential twin turbo setup). But I knew these things off the bat. But the one thing that's still the same is the razor sharp cornering ability! And the smoothness of the rotary.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The "performance" pieces: 18" wheels, & the strut tower brace. The outer styling has kinda grown on me too. I was already used to the engine and all. And BTW, I'm getting better gas mileage (25-26mpg highway + city) than I got with my 300hp 3rd gen (abou 23-24mpg).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far no problems at all, I really can not fault my Superb Mazda RX-8. Fuel economy rate for performance is very acceptable, what do people expect, it is not a Civic, it is a Sports Car. Handling is Superb, #3 in America. Braking is Excellent # 10 rated against all Exotics. Performance is Fantastic for a 1.3 Litre Rotary, 0-60 in under 6.8 Sec is fast for ANY car. Great Value, nothing comes close. This car is Unique. Not a day goes by without a look or comment....is that the new Porsche..one guy asked. Would I recommend this car...Hell Yes..</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned sports cars all my life and my favorite had a 50/50 weight distribution ('75 Alfetta GT). This car doesn't feel as light, or as peppy from what I remember. The only other rotary car I drove was an old MX2, right hand drive imported by a service man and traded through a local dealership. he had bought two, and had to sell one to pay for the EPA expenses to end up with one car. It was hot... this car is not so hot. Not nearly enough torque. Features are nice, variable speed/temp redline is pretty kewl, and rev-limiters in general, also kewl. if you're going to have a hot car you should drive it hard... and this car really isn't all that "hot". I'm not "sorry" I bought.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I needed a third seat for a year old for one, 2000 mile trip, and compared to a rental car and insurance in Mexico, this was a good solution. But, aside from occasional use, not much of a back seat here... and not much of a sports car either.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ok, I purchased a 09 with 503 miles on it: Used. I guess a guy bought it for a month and traded it, so I ended up with great deal for 19k out the door. Besides price the car is basically a Mazda 3 with a very nice body style. Having owned a Mustang GT, Pontiac Grand Prix GXP, Maxima, G35 in recent years, this vehicle tops bang for the buck. Style is key since laser radar is everywhere now a days, but cruising in this is awesome. Smooth and you get plenty of looks, just don't race anyone unless you buy the higher end model. Interior is tight, drives on rails: reminds me of my G35. Reliability seems to be good, 95% of it is made in Japan. </TEXT>

<TEXT>What can you say except wow. Just a sweet looking car that is super fun to drive. We receive compliments everywhere we travel, from the tires and rims to the well appointed interior space. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling is superb and the stereo system is killer. The seats literally hug your body. The exterior stance is wide and low, it simply is a great looking car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have to say this is my first RX8 I have ever owned/driven. I love the car, it feels, sounds and drives so well. It has a very smooth engine. I agree with other sites that the car doesn't have a lot of torque, but it picks up very well. The car is designed to handle, not for pure brute speed. 4 door 4 seater sports car, very sleek looking. I couldn't have gotten anything better for my first sports car at this price range. My advise to anyone interested in the car, test drive it. Actions speak louder than words.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, smooth ride, sounds great, picks up fast too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is an excellent commuting and weekend fun vehicle. Mazda really knows how to use the Wankel to its best advantage. My mileage is way better than the EPA numbers: I am averaging 24 to 26 mpg in a 40/60 city/highway commute. Mine is an automatic 6-speed and I drive as if I enjoy the rotary experience. I sure do get tired of reviewers that claim this car is a gas guzzler only by looking at the lousy EPA numbers. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Superior engine and transmission, great sound system and the ability to haul along the in-laws. :>)</FAVORITE>
