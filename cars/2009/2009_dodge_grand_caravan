<TEXT>Bought this van before the 'Clunker Program', but got a great deal anyways. Wanted a 4.0, but could not find one in the color wife wanted. The 3.8L does fine, it's what I had in my other 4 minivans (2 97's, 98, 2000). Finally getting used to the no key and in-dash shifter. The van has plenty of power, the 3.8 is more than sufficient with the 6 speed. Thought I'd get a little better gas mileage with the 4.0L, but getting 16 with the 3.8L (1100 miles)in mixed driving, but city has lots of stop and go. We're in Texas, so the A/C has never been off yet, maybe in Dec we'll see the MPG go up some. First time I've had to actually read the manual to find out how a lot of the features work!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I mainly purchased this vehicle for spacious cargo and also ability to haul 7 people. Car looks nice as well. Of course, generous incentives helped as well. So far, the vehicle is top notch, no complains. Drove on a highway and averaged 26mpg, about 18.5mpg in the city. Though, several things I wish this car would have: daytime running lights (even my old Astro had it), interior lights can only be lit up all at once. Basic engine is somewhat weak but I did not purchase this to win races. Cheesy green light readouts, it is time to join 21st century. No instant mpg, too bad. Seats fold into the floor: excellent idea. Go get one today!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stow-n-go seats, visibility, good mileage, comfortable seats, lots of interior room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have the 4.0 Liter. It is very smooth and powerful. The ride is a bit sporty which I like and the phone interface is great. I had really wanted the Chrysler limited but I couldn't justify the extra $$. About the only thing I don't care for is the fake leather seating which is mediocre vinyl.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I bought for the stow and go and they work great. I have the power 3rd row tilting seats. A very nice feature. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The vehicle is nice to drive and very comfortable. The acceleration of the motor when taking off is very slow. Brakes and rotors on the vehicle had to be changed on the front after 23000km.The back brakes were fixed on this day at 24000km, due to the squealing on the back passenger side and it turns out the pads were cracked and chipped. There was quite a bit of the pads left in the back brakes. Called Chrysler about it and waiting to see what happens. My mechanic and car part supplier of the new brakes said they have seen a lot of theses problems.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Our fav parts about the vehicle are the stow & go seats and the swivel of the quads. The handling of the van is very good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have had the van in two times winter and summer for the squeaking sliding doors. This is the fourth Dodge I have bought and will be looking to trade it in asap for an import. Very cheap inside. Rear windows don't open except by going back to do it. Would I recommend this to a friend? No I wpould not even recommend to my enemies.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The touchscreen has already stopped working, the day after we bought it. The culprit is faulty software, but of course Dodge does nothing until they have to, there goes another day wasted at the dealership. A new screen has to be ordered. A plastic piece snapped off of one of the stow n go seats. The storage bin on the back of the drivers seat keeps popping out. The interior looks very cheap given what we paid for this van. The material used on the seats, as well as the cushions, probably won't wear well. No wonder the company is in trouble. So why didn't we buy a Honda? Husband thinks they're overpriced.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this vehicle because my wife saw one on the highway and liked the looks of it. I would have preferred the styling of the Chrysler Town and Country, but this was better bargain because it came with so many extra features, including one I didn't especially want--the 3.8 engine. I noticed a few days ago that the rear seat back have rust stains on them. We have had absolutely nothing in the rear well that could have done that. Under each stain, I can feel some sort of metal bar, which I believe may be the source of these ugly discolorations. I will check this out with my dealership the next time I go in for service.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Stow and Go feature is amazing, although it is a bit of a hassle to stow the middle seats because the front seats have to be slid all the way forward to do it. Interior lighting is nice. I really like the dashboard design. The jury is still out on the dashboard-mounted shifter.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Replacing a 92 Caravan. Only a few hundred miles and cannot truly say about reliability. My two previous Dodge minivans were excellent. This one is as close to the Chevy Surburbans that I owned in the70s and 80s with much better mpg. Stow and go is very handy. Wife says the seats are a bit hard bit I disagree. The interior lighting is not what I would want, too dim. Handling is excellent. Fit and finish is excellent. My dealership is one of the best. I bought it off the lot and if I had speced it out I would have left off some of the features and maybe added a few. Price was better than the imports and quality better too. Not sure I like the keyless switch but time will tell.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I would go out and get one right now. Dealerships are clearing out inventory and looking to get out of these vehicles. I bought a sticker price 32,895 for 21,500. It has almost all of the gadgets and has been a joy to drive. I have owned vans from 2 other car companies and I am trying to figure out why I waited to look at Dodge as a viable option. If you are in the market for a van go check them out, you won't be sorry</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my far share of Chrysler disasters and by far this is the best van i've ever owned! I just traded in a 1998 grand caravan sport with 325 000 miles on it when it officaly blew! I've also had a 93 with 220 000 miles on it and the transmission blew. I bough a base van and i'm worried about the transimission like the last ones. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>4.0 six speed 25th</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I'm so impressed with my new van. The transmission is the smoothest - 6 speed is highly recommended with the 4.0. Stow and go is second to none - love it. Quality is good for a vehicle of this price range. Overall drive is quite, controlled, and especially great on the highway. Dealers service was great. I think the engineers in Detroit beat Japan on this one. Don't listen to the critics in California, drive one and compare and support your fellow Americans along the way with buying this superior product for the price. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior quality, mygig, stow and go, 4.0 with 6 speed, overall function, light firm drive feel. Great price</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Never thought I would own a Chrysler product bui I bought a 97 ES which I loved. I though that with the deals available today why not look for a new one. I bought a 09 SXT, only had it a week, but I didn't think I could top my 97, but this is really nice. My wife says it is like traveling in a plane, really smooth ride. The 3.8 engine has plenty of power. Seats aren't as nice as my 97 though, kinda hard. The stow and go seating is nice, My old seats were getting to heavy to remove. The whole van is larger. I did have some minor adjustments to my garage, just barely fits in my small extra garage. Just had my first long trip and was a dream, especially compared to my last long drive in my 97.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power window in the side doors. Stow and go seating. Chrysler design great vehicles, just hard to believe they are in the mess they are in.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The SXT is the best van in the Chrysler line up for price and available options. If your looking to buy go for the 4.0L its the most fuel efficient and is a time proven platform. This van has much more to offer than its competition including stow and go seating better fuel efficiency larger more powerful engine better exterior appearance and the best warranty even if government backed. Regardless of deprecation or the outcome of a Chrysler bankruptcy I'm satisfied that I have that the best van I could find, it meets my personal needs better than any competitor and at a great price. Don't be scared off by the political/economic hype, this is a wonderfully designed well built van.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stow and go seating rocks. the 4.0 steps out a bit better than the Honda Odyssey we test drove witch is no slouch in the pep department. Impressive fuel economy. seats are nice and firm for my bad back.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have had this minivan for only three weeks so keep that in mind. So far we've put 1100 miles on a few road trips and no complaints about the performance. Not great gas mileage in the city, but hey, it's a spacious minivan. With the stow 'n go seating you get a lot of cargo space, great for a trip to home depot. I think the exterior styling of this minivan is better than any other in the market. Can't wait to take it on an extended trip with the family. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stow n' go seating allows for a lot of cargo space without having to lift out any seats. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We are one week into our new Caravan-- fourth we've owned since 1996. So far so good. My only real complaint is that the "new" seats are scratchy and uncomfortable, especially in the 2nd row. There's a bar that hits right at an adult's shoulder blades--OUCH. We have two teens and it's not so great for them. Younger kids would be no problem. Love the dual channel DVD & myGig radio. The backup camera seems to work nicely also. Last one owned was a 2006 and Dodge has cut corners on this new one compared to old-- plastic spoiler on back end, plastic bumper guard, etc. But best improvement--2nd row windows go 2/3 down. Much appreciated change! Great deals out there--go get one!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>2nd row windows can go down, MyGig radio system rocks, new gear shift location weird at first but much easier to use, dual chanel DVD/radio capability keeps everyone happy, umbrella holder & dual glove compartments great, LOTS of in-door storage, stow-n-go seats, new shoulder belts for 3rd row great</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This van has it all. I've read many people say that the 3.3 is "underpowered" but I don't get it. Are these guys racing? Racing in a minivan? I recently took my family camping in the mountains and had the thing loaded to the gills, and was able to drive to the campground just fine. Above all else, the Stow n' Go is the best seating option for my family. I love it! (as an aside, I wonder if Edmunds plans on updating their review of this van with another van in the future. It looks to me like all of their problems were with one van that was probably made on a Firday. Seems harsh not to reccomend a product based on a sampleing of one)</TEXT>

<TEXT>Haven't had this van for 48 hours, so base your interpretation upon that...so far, through test driving and rec driving, it is perfect. The 3.3 L V6 is more than enough for normal driving conditions. We got the base model with an upgrade, so we dont have the navigation, dvd, etc. and the van still seems to provide for the family with normal needs. Build, appearance, and performance have all seemed to be adequate. If you want supperior options, buy a chrysler aspen or an escalade. But how it seems to me so far, for the reasonable family with a budget, this is the best you can get.</TEXT>

The drivers door shuts a little hard and my Homelink is a bear to program. Other than that go buy two. great vehicles.</TEXT>

<TEXT> My minivan looks great inside and out, and has a rock solid build. The van seems to be rock solid on the road also. Dodge has been doing this for 26 years folks and they got it right again. As a former mechanic I check a vehicle out before I buy and this was far superior to the 3.3 and 3.8 vehicles on the lot. 12 months from now I can update this for you folks with long haul driving. I was reluctant to buy during this crisis but strongly feel we should support our manuafacturing base and most likely the worst that will happen is a reorganization of the industry. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This van has a 3.3L/E85. Wish it had the bigger motor, but it does not come with the E85. This van as a lot of toys on it. DVD, MyGiG, Sirius radio. Took our first trip with it. Kids loved the dvd plater, mom and dad had the sirius radio on. This has back up camera on it. It also has the ESP on it. Great in the snow. It comes with a speed stick. Could not resist Dodges 0% financing and employing pricing and other rebates. Bought a $29k for $16k. Last van was a merc with a 4.3L, had more power. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a beautiful vehicle inside and out. I don't see the "seams not lining up" or other problems listed in the other reviews. Seats are a little hard in back but we test drove Kia, Honda, Toyota and they were similar. Handling is responsive and the vehicle has a very nice feel -- solid but nimble. Nice tight turning radius. Ours has the rearview camera which is indispensible and should be on every car. Very quiet on the highway. The DVD with wireless headsets are awesome. This vehicle has a lot of space and great fuel economy for a larger van. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great traction control in the snow for a minivan (I live in Canada), awesome entertainment package, stow and go very easy, side windows that come down, lots of space. With recent troubles we scored this van for 20,000 Canadian!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a kind of no frills Grand Caravan that retails for around 25k. The drivers window sticks, you have to slam almost every door for them to shut properly. You can actually see how things don't line up around the door seams. It handles very stiffly. It has a nice design inside and out but the plastic inside makes it cheap looking. This is a company car and it will be put through its paces. The tranny won't hold on a hill, it rolls backward. The driver seat is very uncomfortable. I got caught in the snow and it slid around like a big sled. I was actually very concerned i would wind up in a ditch. I won't take it out in the snow again. Seems a bit underpowered.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks great for a van inside and out. Except for the cheap plastic wheel covers. Stow and go is a great feature, everything folds down flat and the van gives you plenty of room, especially in the back seat area.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This minivan not only looks great inside and out, the solid feel when driving it is very assuring when hauling the family. The van seems to be rock solid. Dodge is the king when it comes to minivans. I have driven the competition, and the versatility and quality of this vehicle far surpasses the others. I don't understand why the editors rating is as low as it is for this van. I highly recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the 4.0 liter engine, plenty of pep. Using auto-stick makes for spirited accelerations if needed. Edmunds says the rear seats are uncomfortable, they're nothing compared to a Tahoe which we traded for this vehicle. Interior space is also much better organized then the Tahoe. Interior is typical Dodge though, hard angler plastics. Bought this van because wife and I needed a good kid hauler. So far this is fitting the bill much better than our 07 Tahoe did. I'm 6ft, with a 2.5 year old sitting behind me, I can extend seat all the way back with room to spare. Couldn't resist Dodges 0% financing and employing pricing and other rebates. Basically bought a $39k van for $30k. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Entertainment system is incredible. Dual video screens which can play independent of each other. Sirius radio/tv I actually enjoy driving this thing! Rides very smooth, little rough going over bridge/road seams though. Great highway cruiser. Looking forward to our first family trip.</FAVORITE>

The 4.0 V6 has plenty of power and the 6 speed automatic is smooth as silk. We have grown to appreciate a quit ride as we've gotten older and this van delivers.</TEXT>
