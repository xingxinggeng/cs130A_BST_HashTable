<TEXT>I traded a 2008 Mercedes CLK550 coupe. Nice car, but with its massive power, rear-wheel drive and giant tires zero traction in Seattle weather. Also kind of uninvolving from the driver's perspective. The Mazdaspeed is a lot of fun. Plenty of power, comfortable, good handling, most creature comforts, unbelievably practical. A real driver's car. So far I have driven about 2000 miles and getting consistent 25 mpg. in mix of freeway and suburban driving. I cannot believe they can produce this vehicle for the price! It is definitely better value than competitive offerings like Subaru and VW. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, handling, brakes ... mostly the fact that the car always seems to make people smile.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Owned this car for over two months now and it is by far the funnest car I have ever driven. Not quite as fast as my blown 93 Firebird but a better driver. Handling and acceleration are incredible. Nothing quite like hitting the interstate with cruise already on at 75mph and not really pushing it. I drive like that all the time and it still averages over 26mpg. Go figure. Even wifes regular Mazda 3 get great mileage (over 30). Only real issue I have (and its a minor one) is both vehicles have rattles in both front doors by the speakers. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas Mileage well over rated specs. Exhaust note. It sounds like a turboprop aircraft when you lift off the gas. Very cool.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Did a little research on this car and had to take it for a test drive. Well one drive and I was sold! The car is a total blast to drive! The breaks, power and it seat four adults. I never expected a 4cyl to be this fast! I raced my friend in his new bmw 745! on some back roads in western Il and he could not pass me. He could not believe it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, brakes, turbo!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As an intro I am a senior citizen (male) going thru my second late teen episode with sporty cars. The speed3 is without a doubt the best car I have ever driven or owned. It has incredible acceleration performance with concomitant handling/braking/steering. It is a very exhilarating experience to drive though it is easy to break most speed laws. It does NOT want to go slow. It is very comfortably solid cruising at very high speeds. Most passenger just smile with an occasional ooh or ahh as they get plastered to the seat back with the force of acceleration. I bought a Valentine radar/laser detector to help me not get caught when I occasionally have a lapse of attention to my actual speed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The predominant feature is the breath taking acceleration. Next is the truly excellent handling on curves. The quick and precise steering lends to the feeling of control when hard cornering is in process. The drivers accommodations are excellent and comfortable. The seats are exceptional!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is an absolute adrenaline rush to drive. Until something breaks. I have to take it in 6 times for rattles. Dash rattle, chair squeaks and build quality issues are rampant. I thought Japanese cars were supposed to built better than this. My old Hyundai had 0 rattles. What gives, Mazda? I thought the 5 door styling would grow on me. It didn't. Very poor choice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Goes very fast.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>(This is my first week's review, so I rated a 10 on reliability just based upon Mazda reputation). I had to get a red one (naturally). The minute I test drove it I was sold. It is definitely a driver's car. Handling is crisp, precise and responsive, though even with the electronic compensation, I still notice the torque steer. Being 6'3", I fit into it fine, unlike in some other makes where I feel cramped. Fit and finish is nice inside and out, and the car turns heads. Definitely a winner. I didn't realize how great this car is until they gave me a regular 3 as a rental while they put some extra stuff on it. It is like comparing an apple (Speed3) to a pea (3). Lot of car for the money. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Telescoping wheel, HID and LED lights with auto function, fog lights, trunk light (not sure why one reviewer said there wasn't one), electronic headlight positioner, nice gauge display, massive glove box, aux audio jack, lots of cup holders, driver's cockpit fully adjustable for the short and tall.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I loved my 07 mzda 3 5dr and am in heaven with the speed 3. I love the crisp feel and abundant power as it throws you back in the supportive seats. I was looking for a little more zoom zoom and found more than enough. The speed 3 is a confident little monster in subdued wrapping and has just enough visual touches to set it apart without shouting how special it is. Highway MPG is not bad, but around town you have to fight the urge to stick you foot in it, which costs at the pump. But, MPG is not why you buy this car, it's just a nice side benefit when it's good. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, power, nimble handling and the exhaust note. It's solid and reliable performance with refined styling. And did I mention the power and the handling. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After mulling it over for about 2 months I took the plunge and traded my 2008 Mazda 3 5 door hatch for a 2009 Mazda speed 3. My only concern initially was the exhaust sound, but I like it now. I previously had a 318ti, 325i and a minicooper, so I am a tough sell for sporty car. I was blown away with the steering feel, brakes, suspension, and very linear power delivery. I was already used to and liked the Mazda 3, but the speed 3 just makes you want to step on it every chance you get. I think the 18 inch wheels are a bit overkill, especially when you consider the weight of them. I got this car for $20,000 after some serious haggling, what bang for the buck. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>turbo, steering, brakes, suspension, climate control, seats (although a bit short), roomy interior, practical as a daily driver. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I "downsized" from a 6 cyl 3.0 Audi quattro to the MS3. I've only had the car a week but its the MOST FUN I have ever had on a tank of gas. Seriously fast, great exhaust note, comfortable, stylish, feature rich and completely inexpensive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I can't believe how much fun this car really is! it is one of the most fun car's I've ever driven. Definitely best car in its class hands down! It's got comfort, performance, handling, and its practical. You can haul and take four other people with you. This car is a beast! So I suggest going to your local Mazda dealer and driving one of these bad boys!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The MS3 can can be a little terror, or tame; a Jekyll and Hyde type of car. It's amazing how much performance is packaged in a car at this price range. The handling, acceleration and practicality are all superb, not to mention the tough sounding exhaust note. I've also been getting pretty decent gas mileage in the mid 20s.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very supportive Alcantara/leather seats, very powerful motor with an amazing amount of torque, attractive looks and great practicality, automatic windshield wipers, HID lights, True Red color (one of the brightest reds I've ever seen)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased my Speed 3 about 2 weeks ago and so far it has been a blast to drive. It handles extremely well with little torque steer when you want it to really go. Tons of torque and horsepower to play with. Little to no turbo lag when driving aggressively. Gas mileage so far has been about 20 in the city and short highway trips with a mix of spirited driving and just tooling around. The interior is comfortable and clean. Seats do a great job at holding the passengers when cornering. Plenty of room for hauling stuff with the back seats down. Recommend getting the rubber mat for the cargo area. The mirror with compass and homelink is easy to synch with garage doors. Most bang for your buck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Obviously the ridiculous amount of power it produces. Climate control, Seats, sound of the exhaust, the aftermarket customizability of it. The ability to be a sports car and cargo carrier.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you're looking for a car that was built for the love of driving this little burner is the one for you!! It has it all - acceleration, top speed, handling, and braking!! And as added incentive, it's got all the room and usefulness inherent to hatchbacks (in case you have a family to haul at times)!! As an aside, I've gotten 26, 26, and 25 mpg on my first 3 fill-ups in mixed driving... can't beat that!!:-)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the performance aspects... that's why someone will buy this car after all!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The '09 MS3 is a blast to drive. I picked up the True Red GT and it turns heads. It's quick, handles like a dream, stops on a dime, and gets pretty good gas mileage. I had a Mazdaspeed 6, and the 3 drives much better, with an easier clutch to work with. This car begs to go fast.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MPG computer, auto climate control, throaty exhaust, no turbo lag, lots of torque, comfy seats, 6 CD MP3 changer, aux input, HID and LED lights, price</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just recently picked up an 09 in pearl white. Love it, fit and finish and overall car is just great quality.. plenty of power to get me into trouble and will be a great DD and a good autox toy. The LSD in this car works great. and with the big brakes it makes it real easy to have the back end come around on hard corners. LOVE IT</TEXT>
