<TEXT>I bought this vehicle three months ago and still I'm in love with it. It's steering and turn radius is great. It's sleek and sexy looking with a sporty feel. It's great for city driving because it's still a smaller sedan, but big enough where you don't get bullied on the road or feel unsafe if you were to get in an accident. The interior is very stylish and although the buttons/navigation system can seem intimidating, it's not difficult to understand how to use it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation/advanced sound system package is amazing. The stereo and speakers are not only loud and great quality, but it has amazing surround sound. You can hear everything coming at you from all sides. It's awesome!!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had car for 9 mos. 17.5K miles averaging 29-31 mpg. I change oil every 5K no matter what oil life indicator says. Car runs fine, and fast enough to get a couple of warnings. 6 speed and clutch work fine. Two complaints. 3400 RPM @ 80mph cruising is a little high, my 2000 TL does about 2150RPM at same speed. I still have trouble with headlight pattern, sharp cutoff of light field makes hills exciting when driving in mountain passes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I?ve had my 09 TSX 5A for 2 weeks. The car does NOT feel as underpowered as some reviews suggest (an extra 20HP wouldn?t hurt). Steering is not bad (could use more feel). The car likes to be driven fast (unlike my old 06 TL 6M which suffered from serious torque steer and an unhappiness when driven fast). It is also very comfortable and fits like a glove, everything feels right. Love the features: seats, steering wheel, FI paddle shifters, Bluetooth, USB audio (all cars should have this). HOWEVER, there is excessive dashboard glare that washes out the central display in a lot of driving conditions!! Why on earth would Acura use shiny/tacky material on the dash?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I most definitely love my car. Outstanding owner experience. Bought it in October 2008 and have logged 17K+ miles to date. No defects at all! I shopped Lexus, BMW etc. and settled on the TSX. Final choices came down to new TSX or used TL (or used BMW 330xi). Former Honda owner so in the end I wanted reliability and sacrificed AWD. The car is a pleasure to drive (quiet, no rattles etc.). For pure fun, I would have bought the BM'r, but did not want to face any downstream reliability or expensive maintenance. The only minor negative is the car is really so-so in the snow (even with snows) ... traction is not great. Everything else meets or beats my expectations! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Satellite radio, Acura ownership experience (zero issues to date with the car), exterior appearance and very happy with MPG (averaging close to 30 MPG as I do mostly highway driving).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So after driving some (used) BMWs and Infiniti's, I settled on this as it is brand new and has all the tech features I want. I didn't want to drop another $8-15k for the same things. So far I am very impressed with the performance, although it doesn't match BMW or Infiniti. That's not why I bought it. I do not race cars for a living, I drive near 80 miles per day commuting. I need fun and comfort. This car delivers on these. From the very intuitive voice recognition, to the sat radio and USB interface, there is so much fun to be had here. While it is much maligned by um... "professional" reviewers, I thoroughly love this car. For under $30k it more than meets my needs and wants. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav with real time traffic, USB interface, paddle shifters, button heavy console, all the different features with the nav, comfortable seats. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Love my TSX</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I just made the move from BMW 3 series to Acura and I am very happy with the decision. This Acura drives like a dream and I look forward to starting it up every day. The standard features along with the Tech package give you almost every advanced feature imaginable. The performance is almost comparable to the BMW (steering is a bit remote on the highway compared to a BMW) and is much more reliable (also, less expensive to fix - it is a Honda after all). I researched cars for quite some time before buying and could not find another car that combined luxury, performance, tech features, and style as well as the Acura TSX!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the style inside and out. The rear does remind me of BMW styling. Standard and Tech features are amazing. The car does have the most comfortable seats I have ever sat in.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have been driving the car for 8 months now. I found the ride too firm at first, but now I am used to it. The grill-design has grown on me as well. Steering feel is also fine; it is materially better compared to my old car (a 2004 V6 Camry). While not perfect, it is still a very good daily-driver in my opinion. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great gas mileage. Large fuel tank. Lots of standard features. Feels very solid and safe. Great handling compared to my old Camry. Very comfortable front seats. Interior materials are first rate. Acceleration is above-average for a 4 cylinder car. Like the overall size (not too big, not too small). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only had this car for 10 days. For myself, over the past 25 years I have only purchased Honda Accords (all manual trans.). My last 2 have been EX- L and I have always been happy with them. I was planning since last year to buy myself another EX-L Accord (4- cyl) and just by chance I checked out the TSX. I loved it. It came with everything, factory installed, even options like memory seats, passenger power seats, home-link, and directional signals on outside mirrors that you couldn't even get on a loaded 4cy EX-L Accord. In my opinion, the car is so much more solid & luxurious than the Accord. And the gauges and trip computer are awesome!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 2007 Mazda Miata for a 2009 Acura TSX. I thought I would miss the sporty feel the Miata had...but boy was I wrong. I love my TSX. I have only had it about 2 months...but it is amazing:)Plus all the bells & whistles are pretty nice. And the gas mileage is great...I actually got 38.1 mpg on the interstate during an hour and half drive. Usually around town it gets between 28.5-32 mpg. I definitely would recommend this car to anyone.:) Great buy for your money!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had so many problems with the interior quality sometimes I think I bought an American car... over the past year I've had two blown audio speakers, loose defroster vent, two trunk rattles, Navi screen control unit failure, loose exterior windshield molding and a rattle coming from the dashboard that the dealer can't seem to locate/fix. The only thing keeping me sane is that the deal provides a loaner car every time I bring in my car for service (which is about once per month). </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this a couple months ago. I traded in a 2007 Nissan 350Z roadster for this. I haven't regretted it a bit. The comfort, build quality and features far out weigh the lost HP. I highly recommend the 2009 Acura TSX over anything else in its class. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just picked up my TSX. Traded 2005 TL. I love the new TL but it's too big & I was looking for better fuel economy. The ELS music system is outstanding combined with the GPS which comes with a back up camera - in my mine no car for this price can compare. The car is very quiet for a 4 cylinder and has more than enough power. The fit and finish is perfect. It's just the size car I needed with all the bells & whistles. I looked at the Audi A4 as well as the 3 series BMW. Both of these would have cost me over $40,000 with the same equipment. A great car at a very fair price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In a nutshell, the tech package is the icing of a great cupcake. The car itself is a inline 4 but it's better than my old accord v6. It's not as fast my other tl type s - but the horsepower and torque is not wasted either. That's what this car is, it's the comfort of the tech package (do not get this car without it) with a car that's designed for everyday use with some sport appeal. It's definitely fun to drive, it comes to stock with a stability bar for handling, can you believe that? It's car loaded with value and a fun drive factor to boot. I've test driven other cars that were reviewed and found this one to be the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my car the 1st week the '09 TSX babies went on sale. I don't regret a thing. I looked at the IS, A4, MB C-class, Volvo's of various models, and the TSX won hands down with $, features & reliability. Magnificent car. Love the navi knob - a touch screen would require the eyes to be 'off the road'. My TSX has a telescoping steering wheel and a 6 disc in-dash CD player. All my friends love my car. At night the interior looks awesome! UFO style! Fun car & will last a long time! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I moved up to the 2009 TSX from a 2006 TSX. The Grigio dark copper/graphite color is strikingly elegant. Although exterior styling resembles the circa 2006 models, this is a total redesign inside and out. Added length and width make this car appear as large as a pre-2009 TL. Inside, this benefits rear seat passengers, who now enjoy a lot more legroom. Other interior differences are the premium sound, which - on the non-tech - is FAR superior to the rather dismal offering in my 2006 TSX, and includes a sub woofer for deep and thumping bass.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This car has heaps of new features compared to 2008 & prior models. The 2009 TSX non-tech comes with tire pressure sensors, automatic headlights, and a USB dock, allowing control of an iPod OR a standard USB flash drive from the steering wheel!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I?ve been driving my 2009 TSX for a little over 4 weeks and have had an opportunity to compare in detail to my 2005 TSX, which I still own. The 2009 TSX is a far superior vehicle in terms of driving comfort, acceleration, handling, cabin noise, low speed maneuverability, turning radius, fuel economy, and overall refinement. I have read the professional reviews and my conclusion is that these people drive the car for a few hours on a test track in situations that are not representative of daily driving conditions for the average buyer of this vehicle. Having said that, I do agree, that 2009 TSX is not a ?sports? sedan and probably should not be marketed as one by Acura. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A fine daily driver and represents a good value for a vehicle that lists under $30K. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had the car for about a month now. Went from 2000 Infiniti G20, so TSX was a natural progression for me. That being said, the power and the pickup is far greater. Acura maximizes the ability of a 4 cyl engine while making it fuel efficient. Getting about 27-29 mpg in 70-30 highway driving. I'd advise not to take your MPG reading off the monitor and actually calculate it yourself, you'll find it to be about 1-2 MPG difference, but still great mileage. Note that this is an everyday sports sedan. If you want a high performance sports car, get a BMW 3 series or Lexus IS-250. The rest of us who go to work everyday, want to have a little fun and not pay a fortune in doing so will enjoy this car</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of luxury features for the buck. Leather seats, interior lighting at night is gorgeous, USB reader and actual socket plug is genius. Sound system is crisp, clean bass w/ the sub. Ride is comfortable and outside noise on freeway is not noticeable in my opinion. Nice pickup from 4th to 5th gear</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought myself a TSX for my birthday, upgrading from a 98 VW that had lost its lust for life (as well as my love of driving), and I am astounded at how much I love to drive this car, and how others react to it. Its powerful, responsive, comfortable, efficient and for the price to what you get, its second to none. I am still getting used to parking it in a small parking lot, but the majority of that is new car jitters. Everything thats important is top-notch, some of the small things, I would have changed. Others have mentioned the screen glare, bluetooth mic is ho-hum and far away, elbow rests take some effort, lower grille is weak plastic and deforms in weeks, and radio "forgets" settings.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>USB and other jacks, Xenon, leather surfaces, change drawer, one-touch controls, XM (Sirius soon also?), oil monitor, tire monitor, MPG stats, great looks, sunglass holder, highway speed in gear 4-6 easily, auto rearview mirror and lights, highly adjustable seat, massive leg and headrooms, big trunk</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a 2006 TSX that I loved. So when my lease expired, I jumped on a new 2009 TSX without even bothering to test drive. Big mistake. They've taken the fun out of driving with the addition of electronic steering. I can't feel the car. I feel detached from the whole experience I used to love about driving. The odd thing is, the suspension is still tight enough to feel the road beneath me, while still giving it stability in the corners, which I can no longer feel. The slight increase in size from the previous model wasn't put to good use. The interior feels cavernous, adding one more level of remove from the "feel" of driving. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The stereo and iPod integration are awesome. 32 MPG. Solid build. Rear view camera. All the toys are fun. Comfy seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The ads are not aiming at a young, spirited 65 year old male. Previous 2005 TL owner, love the new TSX. Front seat wraps around and supports well, the handling is taut but not to stiff, acceleration is adequate. Back seat a little too tight for 3 men over 170 lbs, the cd should have more than room than 1 disc. Sound quality is crisp on a trip from Boca Raton, FL to Boston average mpg 34.5 excellent, around the city mpg approx. 24. I kept within 70 mph. Good mileage can be achieved, if ego does not get in the way! People on cape cod and in the city have favorably mentioned the new styling. I do not feel add the old model is better, this is new car with a different cachet! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the car 1 month, 2K miles and averaged 33.5 mpg. I can't imagine not having the tech package. The stereo cannot be matched - crisp, clean, strong and the nav is very easy to use. The 6 speed manual is the soul of the car, the steering did take some getting used to, and became more predictive over time. It is not a point and shoot car like the Mazda3 S that I had, but it handles quite nicely with a much more refined feel. The engine is very sweet in the upper RPM, I have not found that I wished for more power, especially at $4/gallon. The seats are extremely comfortable.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Go the 6 speed manual - best in class hands down - snikity smooth. 5.1 stereo, intuitive navigation, bluetooth, climate control, glossy metal flake paint (grigio), steering wheel is just the right size, trunk release membrane button above license plate (discovered that one by accident).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've been driving this car for about two weeks now, and loving every minute of it. Keep in mind, I switched from a V6 with over 240 HP and torque. I was hesitant about getting a 4 cyl, but you can't tell the difference in every day driving with this car. It has more than enough power, I'm not drag racing from a stop sign or traffic light. The handling is excellent. The interior is top of the line Japan quality, and has more room than the Lexus IS. I didn't need the navi system, but the stock premium audio sound systems sounds great!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car in July of '08. I considered BMW, Lexus, Audi, Accord and a few others. But the features for price, comfort, drive won hands down! Car drives great, awesome handling with steering, good acceleration (use pedal shifters... fun!). I've always wanted an Acura, and this was the exact way to finally step into the brand! Had considered the '08 and the '09 TSX. The redesigned exterior of the '09 is what won me over and took a bigger chunk out my pocketbook.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had nothing but Volvos since 1982. TSX compared favorably with S80, 328, IS 250, CTS and was cheaper. MPG has been great - 36+ hwy and 30+overall. I still haven't mastered the tech pack. That lady doesn't understand KYeze. I have one negative: Steering is very sensitive and feels "notchy" in turns and there is sometimes a distinct steering torque with acceleration in turns. I have not investigated with dealer. One more thing: don't break a mirror - $525. So far dealer experience has been very positive.</TEXT>

A total upgrade, smoother ride, surprising power from the high strung I4 (F1 technology at its best), perfect fit and finish. You can feel the quality, and the features are easy to get use to. Sporty european styling gets me nothing but compliments where ever I take it. I hope to enjoy it down the road as much as I do now.</TEXT>

The felt trunk lining is already coming loose. The car lacks power. If I had to do it over again I would have sprung for an Infiniti or Lexus. I will be selling this car the first chance I get.

<TEXT> I just don't get it. In a lot of magazines reviews and forums people slam this car as not as good as the old and not as powerful as the G35, etc. It costs another 5 grand to get the same options on these other cars. For the money this is the best thing going.The old car got great reviews and this car is even more improved than that one. I like the styling, and from what I have seen it is the best looking car in the new Acura lineup. This car is not sluggish at all, but it is not made for drag racing. What I value most of all in terms of performance is the handling. This thing takes corners well and I've never gotten a ticket for cornering. The tech package is the way to go hands down.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE> The technology package is great. The paddle shifters are fun to have for when you're in the mood. For me the fold down seats are key. I looked at many cars that didn't have them.

<TEXT>The car is gorgeous. I have gotten so many compliments on its appearance and luxury features. I didn't do the performance package because it wasn't worth the extra $3000.00 when I can use my handheld Garmin instead. The steering is very sensitive at highway speeds and needs a gentle touch. I'm only getting about 24 mpg with a combination of around town and highway. I was between the TSX, the Honda Accord & Audi A4. I am very happy with my decision. There is plenty of leg room both front and back. I had a friend who was 6'4" comfortably in the back. Plenty of headroom and a huge step up from the Honda Accord in performance, comfort and appearance. Well worth a few extra dollars.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We only considered Lexus IS or ES and TSX. We have owned 2009 TSX for 2 weeks. It is bigger than IS, which is a good thing and a bad thing. We bought TSX, mainly for the interior. My wife does not like the exterior, but I really like it. The car is the right size for us, but maybe too big for people who need to navigate through tight garage. It is the just the best value for entry level luxury sedan, you get a lot for the money. You have to test drive it to know if you like it or not. EPS saves power.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lowest price for most features, best safety rating, best fuel economy (27 mpg mixed), 4-cylinder is best for daily commute & powerful. Audio has USB port for MP3, I put in a thumb drive.

<TEXT>I just bought this car a week ago and I'm beyond thrilled! Being my first new car purchase out of graduate school, I knew I wanted the reliability of Acura (read Honda) and practical, while still sporty. This fits the bill perfectly. Sure, the grille looks a little odd (or Mazda/Saturn-like), but that's about the only gripe for me. The i-VTEC engine is a great blend of spunk, fuel efficiency and environmental friendliness (even though I'm not on the "save the planet boat," it's still impressive to see a ULEV vehicle that can still perform). The six-speed transmission and the tech package are the way to go!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Spunky, practical, reliable, and amazing value for the amount of technology packed in there! At fully loaded, it's still below the base price of comparable alternatives: BMW, Lexus, Audi, etc. The six-speed is a blast, also.</FAVORITE>

I did a ton of research and the longer I've had the car the happier I am with the purchase.

<TEXT>Some ask why I just didn't buy an Accord.. it would've been cheaper. After 4000 miles now in my TSX, I can tell them the TSX is definitely worth the extra few grand over the Accord. The ride is better, the materials and fit and finish is a notch above that of the Accord. And the Accord is just a little bit too big for me. Looked at competing products from Lexus, Audi, BMW, etc. and the TSX cannot be beaten in terms of value. Load up the others with the same options as in the TSX and you can expect to pay much more. </TEXT>

<TEXT>New & improved! Quite an upgrade from my 06 TSX and I thought that car was nice. This car is hot! Better lease than Accord EX. Civic Si on wish list but doesn't compare! Smooth highway ride with less wind noise. Better turning radius, great steering. Decent MPG, comfy seats like Volvo. Smooth shifting 6M. Grigio Metallic great alternative to silver/gray. Only gripe is the interior trim looks cheap as do the door handles. Acura has made a believer out of me. Loyal customer for life!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had car for two days. Traded in a Camry Hybrid for more than I paid for it 8 months ago w/9k miles on it and couldn't pass on the opportunity. The Camry Hybrid averaged 35 miles per gallon and was a bit uncomfortable, not fun to drive, and most of all I felt that the current hybrid hoopla will soon be looked upon like a fad as new technology is introduced. The '09 TSX gets "near" what I got with the Camry Hybrid, but is more fun and the intention is to drive it to 150k+ miles like I did with my 97 TL (my 03 MDX has 80k miles on it). Have two small kids and the backseat, of course, has slightly less room than the Camry - biggest con, but expected longevity and drive make up for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the car for two weeks and love it!! It handles great and has better than expected acceleration. Its comfortable all around and the build quality is great. I am averaging 28 mile per gallon (local driving). Compared many cars to the TSX but the Acura consistently won because of features and price. I got a great deal on the purchase and am so glad I decided on the TSX. Get this car, you won't be disappointed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Within a day of buying this car I drove it across 5 states, nearly 1250 miles in total one-way. This is a pretty quick way to judge a new car. I was coming out of a BMW that I loved dearly but like a bad relationship, it was time to let it go. :) My heart will always be with BMW due to the unbelievable handling, but I have to say that this Acura is really great. It is a cute car, gets great gas mileage, and has a wonderful tech package. I would NOT buy it without the tech package; Acura's technology is amazing. While driving across various states, I averaged between 80-105 mph. So what type of gas mileage did I get? 33 MPG! I am only using premium fuel, as recommended by Acura.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Technology package - Acura navigation is hands down the best on the market. It is easy to use. I love the bluetooth feature through the speakers... no stupid little thing in your ear while your driving around! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2003 BMW 325Ci coupe on the 2009 Acura TSX just over one week ago. I was a little apprehensive of going from my BMW to the Acura, giving up two cylinders, German engineering and just the cachet of having a BMW. I decided, however, that I needed to make a change for better reliability and the addition of two doors for practicality. Albeit it's only been about ten days, but I am pleasantly surprised at how much I have fallen in love with my TSX. It has all of the amenities that my BMW had and more. The fit and finish is impressive. Fuel economy is about twenty percent better - 24 mixed in the BMW to 29 in the Acura. People on the street even stop me to ask about it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Luxury feel - solid and quiet, six speed transmission - sport feel with short, quick throws, stereo - the sound is killer and the USB port for my iPod integrates it into the stereo, engine - high revving, sport feel, looks - people didn't comment on my BMW this much, headlights - Xenons are great</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After two weeks of ownership, I am thrilled. Best blend of luxury, performance, reliability, comfort, technology, and fuel economy that money can buy. Period. A comparably equipped Lexus, Infiniti, or BMW will cost $5,000 more, minimum. The Acura comes loaded with standard features, and the TSX's size is just right; roomy but not too big. A surprise has been the 35-40 mpg highway (on cruise control), 28 mpg with some city driving thrown in. With the larger 18.5 gallon tank, it's now possible to drive almost 600 highway miles on a single fill up. Amazing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Superb seats. Floating needle gauges are trick. Great ergonomics, steering wheel controls, Bluetooth Handsfreelink, USB/iPod integration, and premium sound system - all standard. Polished Acura sill plates are a nice touch.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you look outside of Edmunds there are so many negative reviews on this car, but honestly I have no idea what these people are talking about. You get so much technology and bells in whistles for the price compared to VW, Audi, BMW or even Lexus. I looked at them all and even though all those cars were good in their own right I felt the Acura was the one to get. I am 6'2, 250 and find the seats very comfortable and the car a pleasure to drive. This car has the perfect blend of great gas mileage without having the usual sacrifice of an under powered engine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been driving my new TSX for a week now and love it. Acura did a great job of making the most popular features standard (Xenon, Bluetooth, etc). The car has more than adequate pickup and handles very well. It also has a nice back seat. We test drove the IS 250, A4, G35, and S60/60. The TSX has the best combo of space, size, features, and performance of the group. The TSX's motor is superior to that of the IS 250 and A4 IMO. It has similar real world performance capabilities and gets better mileage. It is a very refined little car. Perfect for us. The IS and A4 were too small in the back seat and don't match the MPG--I am getting 29.7.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased 2 09 TSXs for my wife and son. I own an 07 MDX. Acura is smart in providing a great deal of similarity between all models. The 09 TSX now becomes the little brother to the TL as opposed to the being the big brother to the Civic. My wife had an 05 TSX which we added the ground effects package to to make it stand out. Nothing was really functional and the 09 has seemed to incorporate this in its styling while bearing strong similarities and function to my Tech MDX. Nice ride, excellent handling and eye catching styling. Reliability has always been great and so far gas mileage is as advertised. I have owned a lot of high end. This is the best for the bucks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I read a ton of reviews before buying my TSX 09. I found most of the things people did not like, were things I actually liked. Steering, power, number of buttons, front grille and similar items were all big dings from the auto magazines and car enthusiasts. But my experience, so far, is it's a great car. I know it's the lower end of the high end automobiles, but I'm a techy kind of guy, and this car is more to my liking than some of the high end cars. I like not having to stop to fully use the nav system. I like talking to my car to control almost everything in the car. It's even fun to say a few things to it that are not in the guide and find a few actually work I love my car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've been enjoying the car for over a month and I get stopped from time to time by people interested in the car or the basque red color. Fuel mileage has been better than the EPA rating. In all city driving, averaging under 19 mph, we get around 22 MPG. With constant highway driving we get about 35 MPG. We've been happy with acceleration, passing ability and cruising as well. I'm unaware of other upscale cars that match the combination of comfort features, performance and fuel economy. The TSX seats are very nice. My wife likes driving and riding in the TSX better than in the Audi A4 2.8l we traded in. Back seat guests have liked it as well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been driving German cars for the past 5 years, but rising gas prices made me look into an entry level sport-luxury sedan with a 4 cylinder NA engine. The TSX is unique in the market, and the car drives like a dream. It's light and agile-feeling, power with the 6 speed manual is good, the comfort is right on the money and the tech features are a bonus. The fuel economy so far is excellent! There seems to be some controversy surrounding the looks of the car, but park it next to a 2008 or earlier model, and it makes the old car look instantly dated. It definitely has more street and parking lot presence than the previous model.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2007 Acura TL with only 11,000 miles on it. I sold it and am glad I bought the 2009 TSX. It's quieter, handles better and the gas mileage is much improved : I went from averaging 20mpg to 28mpg. That's an approximate savings of almost $600 annually based on the 10,000 miles I drive. The TSX's looks are complimented by people that see the vehicle. It's an all around enjoyable car to drive and as much as I liked my TL, I like my TSX better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Test drove both the TL & TSX and the TSX is a lot more fun to drive so I bought it. Love the interior and overall exterior, unsure about the huge grill. I'm just hoping that it isn't a rock magnet. Performance and mpg are fine for my taste. My complaints are minor ones: way too much glare from the navi window, no inside gas door release, I can see it freezing it up in the winter, and when using the bluetooth it's annoying to say dial or call a number and then having to confirm what you want to dial. Great handling car in the city and definitely comfortable. Simply love the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just picked my new '09 TSX (Polished Metal/Black) on Monday. So far it's been nothing but fun fun fun to drive. The Bluetooth is an amazing feature. The base model comes pretty loaded up with the exception of a CD changer and the navigation system, but really, why spend the extra $3,000 or so on the navigation system when you can just go to Wal-Mart or Target and buy one for around $200? Anyway, I'm glad I got the car. It was between this or the '08 Accord and even though the dashboards are very similar, the exterior design was the deciding factor for me. It looks great!</TEXT>

I looked at all the 4 cyls because at 4.00 a gallon gas I thought I needed to move down. I am so happy I did it. This car has been nothing short of spectacular. The ride is solid, the power is fun and all you need in the city. I love the reworking of the Vtec it seems much more useable than the old model was. I am 6'2" 285 lbs and am very comfortable. The stereo and navi in itself are exceeding my expectations, especially the nav traffic with the re routing feature, in Houston I have to use this a lot!</TEXT>

What a great surprise bonus: first tank, 523 mi. w/51 mi left; varied speed 68-78, 35.5 MPG!! Mountain twisties w/paddles were great fun; handling is confident and sure-footed. Some aggressive driving/small town traffic brought second fill-up to 29.8. Trip home was combo of 2-lane w/small towns and interstate, 33.7 mpg. Did not expect NEAR this! The sound system/iPod convenience is marvelous. TSX is very comfortable; two 500+ days not tiring at all. Compare the 7 or so cars in this class- nearest comparably equipped car is priced $5K higher. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The New TSX is nothing like the old one, it has sharp crisp lines, ground effects, beautiful wheels, and a very aggressive look. The first think I noticed is the Cockpit, with the new gauges, revamped center console, and the Navigation screen now indented into dash, there is no "cabin" feel to the car, it feels like a cockpit! The ride is amazing as well, if i drove it blindfolded i would swear it was a six cylinder. The 09 actually has 4 less hp than my old 05, yet it is faster due to more torque. I am completely enthralled by this vehicle, it is as dramatic a change as i have ever seen since i test drove the 04 TL when compared to the 03 TL. This is a beautiful car inside and out</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I drove the 2009 model, then the 2008 for comparison. We thought we might get a deal on the 2008 model, but the new model was well worth the higher price! The ride is much more refined and less floaty, the steering lighter and more connected. It feels very nimble, just the way I want an urban commuter. The steering may be too light for sport sedan enthusiasts. The ride is still a little busy and noisy, which is typical of this makers products, but very acceptable, and lightyears ahead of my RDX. The finish and feature set are by far the best we saw any where near this price.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>New to Acura</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Go drive it for yourself. Fits anyone (adjustable console, telescoping wheel, etc.) As a taller person (6'2", 225) who has never owned a "car" I was surprised with the size and comfort of the TSX. My much smaller fiancee also feels as if the car fits her perfectly. In my opinon, Acura's luxury, reliability, and performance rivals all others at similar price points. The new body style of the TSX is very attractive. Interior is better overall than the TL. Only wish is that we had gotten the navi and that there were some woodgrain in the interior.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>New body style, ride comfort, and gas efficency are great. Tech and features on the standard model are great. My fiancee loves the bluetooth integration. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had two Audi A4s and a Ford Fusion, all of which I liked very much. However, for the money, the Acura TSX is the best car I've had. Excellent fuel economy, great features, nice design, and Honda/Acura reliability made this a no-brainer to buy. I, like many, am not overly thrilled with the electronic steering, and it took some getting used to. Frankly, now, however, I don't notice that it's any different from any other car I've driven. It's really only noticeable on highways; city driving is just like any other.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my '09 Acura TSX with tech package three weeks ago. It has been fun to drive it. The stereo system is phenomenal! I have also been using the live traffic report before heading home from my office. The ride is quiet, and the voice command system is superb, even for someone with a thick foreign accent!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ok I'm going to slam this car a little, because the voice activation system has major flaws, and this prevents you from being able to operate your hands free phone link. For whatever reason, there is no option to dial your calls out, without using the voice activation system (which means the car has to hear and understand your VERBAL commands). This means that when you can't get your verbal command through to the car, that you're basically not able to call out. For a luxury car, this is absolutely unacceptable. I understand this is new technology, but they could easily have allowed for a way to dial out calls without using the very flawed voice activation.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the overall quality of the car, except for the voice activated commands, which is SEVERELY flawed. You can tell that this car was built with GREAT quality, and I love the ride, way the car handles, the interior comfort, and the looks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded 2001 Passat on my first Acura, not as smooth/quiet of a ride, but for the $$ a good trade off. Looking for better reliability along with gas mileage. Last 5 tankfuls have exceeded 33 mpg, country driving 45 to 55 mph for 50 miles R/T per day. No problems after 4 months. A must look for the $$ with many standard features compared to models in the same class. Looked at Audi A3/A4 & Honda Accord.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Took a 3500 mile trip through Colorado, Wyoming, and South Dakota in May. Averaged 30 mpg. Fun car to drive through the mountains. Smoothest six speed and clutch I have ever driven. Steering takes a little time to get used to. Would have liked a few more horses in the mountains, but if you keep the rpm up above 3500 it does well. The DVD audio is awesome. The trip computer is one to two MPGs optimistic. No auto is perfect but the TSX is a good mix and for the money is hard to beat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Loved the car when first purchased. Like the car now. Voice rec., nav, bluetooth not perfected, not close. Very irritating when not functioning properly. Mechanically sound. Thinnest layer of paint under trunk lid, three areas of rust already. Lots of rattles (poor quality control), dealership can't correct to this point yet. Hopefully fixed after this week. ELS stereo best I've heard (much better than G35 bose, etc...). However, other brands will get much closer look when next new car purchase comes around...</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned 6M TSX since Jan 1 and put over 12Kmiles on. Pluses - high mileage, pretty fun to drive, initial reliability is as high as I expected. Minuses - low end torque is light, revs about 3100RPM at 72-75mph. My old 2000TL does 2100@80mph. Other - not sure console display sometimes hard to read, CD slot is difficult to manage at highway speed. I am uncomfortable with long service intervals and change my oil at 5K no matter what oil life indicator says. Overall, good dependable, fun to drive car, would definitely consider another one in a few years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my TSX now about 3 months. I love just about everything on the car - the paddle shifters, the stereo system (try real DVD-As), the ipod usb jack, the backup camera, etc. But most especially the engine - what a sweet little V-4 - I have been getting 27.4 MPG in mixed driving. When I do all highway, I am consistently in the low 30s mpg. Agree the steering feels a little remote, but still drives wonderfully. I looked at BMW 3s and Aud A4s, but the cost was nowhere close (yes, may be better but not $10k better). Who needs a 6 cyl today?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like the car and you can see what's good about it reading the other reviews. But, I did find a number of problems with my TSX. 1. The sunroof seems to make noises at times. 2. The glove compartment makes rattling noises. 3. The audio display (where the navigation should be for TSXs with the tech package) has a glare at certain times of the day. Sometimes, it's to the point you cannot read what's on the display. I have heard that you can get a matte material to place beneath the display to rid of the glare. 4. The front two speakers crackle at certain frequencies. It is, overall, a good vehicle and I am happy that I have purchased it, but there are some problems that should be rectified.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my TSX almost a year ago now and I get a lot of compliments from ppl. I didn't get the nav sys because it was way more expensive that just buying a separate one if you don't have one already. The brake pads were defective, it started making the annoying squeaky noise after only 4 months. The bracket that holds the trunk door went out of place because some wire was not connected properly, so it wouldn't open with the remote control. They were both fixed under warranty at no cost. Great service, just inconvenient to spend a couple of hours each time to fix a new car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great looks, accelerates really quickly, seats are very comfortable, USB connection for MP3 player. The gas tank locks when the car does. Only 2 oil changes/yr max. Runs very quietly too; can't notice it is running when parked.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded my 2006 TL. Got the TSX because TL no longer offered a manual transmission. Got the wing spoiler and underbody molding. Looks really "hot" in the basque red. That said, I should have stayed with the TL. Navigation is a waste. I can read a map; "direct route" keeps you on main roads & takes you the long way; traffic conditions on radio is better. Drivers seat has a hard spot in the middle of my back. The switchblade key spring is wearing out in less than a month. Radio has static. Bluetooth doesn't connect (this was problem with 2006 TL; I would think they would have this fixed by now). Computerized MPG calculator isn't correct after fillups.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my TSX! Since I got it back in February I put 9K miles on it and I average 27.3 MPG. I also clocked it at 7.1 0-60 and 15.2 1/4 mile. Edmunds times are way off to everybody else's for some reason (car&driver, road and track, motor trend etc) by about 1 full sec. for 0-60 an 1/4 mile! I love the handling .084 and the road feel. You can't beat that value for the money! Try to get a A4 or 3 series for $30K! That's not going to happen! If you're looking for something fun, reliable, with the best resale value in its class - you found it! I'm very happy with my car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven my 09 TSX/Accord Euro for over 3 months and put 4000+ miles on it. My first 4 cyl after 20 yrs. Hate the shake from the engine, (I know the V6 is coming, but for $5K please...) makes the car feel cheap, once accel. it is smooth. The ride is too firm on the highway, very tiring. I've owned sports coupes and luxury cars and don't know if it is the seats (too firm or suspension). Tech pack great, however the XM Radio dynamic range is poor compared to my 06 Nissan Morano. DVD-A and IPOD audio amazing. Who designs cars should create deeper footwells in back seats, stupid. Use the S selection on the Automatic, wow drives like a different car. Too much road noise. Again? No.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been driving my TSX for a month now and I like it a lot except for the ride quality. The suspension is way too stiff and the ride is jittery on any surface (as noted in Consumer Report). I'm told that it will soften with time. I hope so. The 5.1 sound system is outstanding. I don't have a problem with the nav screen because I'm short but I can see that if I was several inches higher in the seat, I would see the reflection of the windows in the nav screen. Not good. Excellent build quality overall and no problem whatsoever so far. I'll report again later in the year.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had our TSX for a short time, but can honestly say that this car represents one of the best bargains available. From the styling to responsiveness, the TSX delivers. Honestly, I hadn't even looked at the TSX until two weeks before we bought the car. The first look left me very impressed. I've had several people comment on how nice the car looks; both inside and out (There are not a whole lot of new cars sold these days, so the lack of a license plate draws attention as does the car). On top of appearance, Acura's top-quality brand reputation made this purchase a no-brainer. Lexus IS was too small. VW CC was nice, but the Acura was better in our opinion.</TEXT>

Forget the audi 4, volkswagen cc and every other entry level luxury car- you are at $420-$470 oh and none of them have a trunk. My clubs, folding chairs and kids baseball equipment all fit nicely in the tsx. Car is beautiful paladium silver with gray interior-hard to find by the way--dealer was great - something about salesmen in suits as opposed to polo shirts at most other places. Car is solid and tight, very quiet, front seat hugs you nicely like a sports car should - 4 cylinder is not as peppy as my old passat but it is passable. Stereo is above average but not great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had my new 2009 TSX for two just weeks when I heard a crackling noise coming from the rear shelf area. The dealer said it was known issue; Acura had issued a service bulletin to address this problem. The dealer kept the car to carry out the fix. Picked up the car but the noise returned shortly before I arrived home. Very disappointed in Acura for producing a defective product then selling it with a known problem. The Navi system has also been acting up. Generally the car has a spirited feel to it with a responsive engine. However the on-center feel at highway speeds is very poor-one needs to constantly correct steering. The seats are too firm and leave you sore after a road trip.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I "fell up" to a TSX when considering a loaded Jetta TDI. For about $3k more, I got a car with much more polish that is as fun to drive. I like both the exterior and interior styling, although some people hate it. I've always driven manuals, but the auto TSX is plenty of fun, and I enjoyed it more than the 6-speed. The car is nimble, extremely comfortable, and is a bargain. Some complain that it's not as muscular as a BMW 3 series or an Infiniti G37. This is true. It's also many thousands of dollars less expensive. For me, this was the sweet spot of price/performance. I have only owned the TSX for a month, so my "reliability" score is at this point more of a hope than a rating.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior fit and finish is simply superb. It feels like it was carved from a solid block of material by elves with jeweler's tools. The handling is taut, and there is very little body roll when manhandling corners. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Though less than a month old, I am in love with this car. I previously owned a 2005 Volvo S40 turbo, and while I have nothing but good things to say about that car, I think I like my 2009 TSX better. The interior can feel a bit like the cockpit of a 747 at first, but within days I was comfortable navigating and controlling it. The nav system with integrated blue tooth and iPod is a dream, and the the backup camera, while cheesy, is a nice touch. The only drawback to this car is power. At barely over 200HP, it seems hesitant to accelerate. The handling and braking work like a champ, but I would love to see this with a turbo. Overall, this is a fantastic car!</TEXT>

The louder the road noise the louder the static gets when you increase the volume to listen while using the bluetooth.

Yes, with 4 cylinders you don't feel that extra umph of power you get from a V6 but it's more than enough, especially from city driving. I get 29.4 miles to the gallon (calculated). The backseat feet area can use some more room but it's roomier than the IS for sure. All my friends who have been in my car love it as well.

The TSX is seemingly slower (much heavier than the MZ3) and has a terrible engine rattle, which is widely reported. Dealers are stating this is a "normal" sound. I would probably be happier with the car overall if it had more power and the engine didn't sound like my 1993 Saturn with 180,000 miles on it.

<TEXT>I purchased this car brand new. After about 3 weeks I started to notice the brakes squealing. After seven months and numerous trips to the dealership, the problem has not been corrected. Acura doesn't seem to know how to fix the problem and the dealerships are not willing to try any more repairs. For 30K the brakes should not constantly squeal. What an embarrassment for a vehicle considered luxury. Stay away from this car. For the money buy a Lexus IS. If I go back I would leave this car on the lot. Oh and there is a rattling noise from underneath the car anytime you accelerate. Sounds like something is loose. What a disappointment. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have 2500 miles on new TSX. It's a very nice well rounded car...very good at everything though maybe not best-in- class at anything, except price/value. Drives very well, taut but not too stiff, nor mushy like Camry. Manual tranny is super though still getting used to that 6th gear. The engine, while not stout, performs superbly...you hardly notice when running at high revs...and MPG compares to my old VW Passat turbo despite being a heavier car (though the MPG reading calculated by the TSX is inflated about 10% vs actual). The interior comfort, esp the seats, are great...and the features (Ipod; XM; homelink; bluetooth) are amazing for the price. Definitely worth a close look! </TEXT>

<TEXT>TL was last minute compromise on the last day of 2008. Still have a 2000 TL with over 160K on it so Acura reliability is a big plus. I looked at TL-SHAWD, but could not get over the BEAK. I also wanted a manual, fund to drive car with high reliability, low maintenance costs and good gas mpg. This car fulfills all of that and is a pretty comfortable driver to boot. Mileage is averaging 28-31 mpg, 6 spd is easy to use and car is not so "hot" that I am adding too many speeding tickets to my collection. Stereo is good, I dropped XM subscription after new car trial and use an Ipod instead. Overall, a pretty good deal with a low cost of ownership.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Acura TSX 5 days ago and I love it. At first I would kind of skeptical about buying a 4 cylinder vehicle, never even drove one before, but I can't even tell it's a 4 cylinder. If you are looking for an entry level luxury car, go and test drive one today! I bought mine from Smail Acura in Greensburg, PA and they showed me top of the line service.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased a Mercedes C280 sedan new in '96 then bought out my lease. I had considered replacing it since about '03, looked for a new car every so often but couldn't find a worthy replacement, test drove many cars. This TSX was love at first sight. I had no idea Acura had redesigned the TSX until I visited the dealership - old one was a little too small & plain for me. Love It! Awesome! Fun! Intuitive! I feel like I'm driving the best looking car (definitely under 50K!) on the road. Honda/Acura reliability, 0-60 faster than the inline-6 Benz I sold, handles great, all the gadgets you want. Didn't get the tech package because a 6 disc changer is so 90's and I want a portable NAV. Cool!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a Mitsu Eclipse GT for 7 years and put 148K miles (ZERO problems with that car). After contemplating whether to finally buy "my tsx" or continue driving the eclipse, there was no question once I got in. The seats hug you, the interior is nicely laid out and stylish. Good visibility inside the car, love the headlights too. The car grabs the road around turns and cruises down the highway. Even when I hammer on the car, I get no less than 28mpg. When I pay attention to real time mileage, I can get 32mpg. There is a certain power band and it doesn't start until 3500rpms. DO NOT 'race' anyone from a light... the car stumbles at the drop of the clutch until about 2K rpm.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Leased a '09 TSX (w/out tech package) - great car and compares very well against my '06 TL that I turned in. Well built and very high in the electronics features - much better than my '08 Cayenne. I do not miss the DVD audio system in my TL as I had 1 dvd audio disc - however w/out that feature the stereo is great as is the Ipod interface. Performance is good - not as good as the TL but it gets the job done and the black on black color combination works great. It looks great and drives very smooth. I looked at A4, VW CC, etc but none came close to the deal on the TSX + the dealership blew every other dealership away.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All interior features - yes you do get used to the buttons fairly quickly. The exterior design has really grown on me - for the $$ - about $5K less than base TL - I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything.</FAVORITE>

Feels safe and handles well, especially when cornering (unlike the Corolla). Rear view camera makes reversing safer and easier, and all round visibility is good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for 3 months, and it has grown on me with age. After test-driving several other mid-size sedans and sport sedans, I chose the TSX because of its aesthetic appeal inside & out (Yes, I like the grill), overall value and Honda's reputation for reliability. It is a fun car to drive, certainly more sporty and luxurious than the I4 Honda Accord, but it?s not a speed demon. The TSX has been getting 25 mpg combined. It rides smooth, handles with sure footedness, and has some pep when you need it. The iVTEC feels very much like a turbo, there?s lag until it hits around 4K RPM ? then VA VA VOOM.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this Acura TSX two weeks ago, and I absolutely love it. This is a fun car. Love the hi-tech features such as the USB port (connect a USB thumb drive or an iPod and listen to music). I like the fact that it charges my iPod and I can control the play list and songs from the dash console. This car has an excellent 360 watt sound system. I also love the gas mileage. This car gives me 26 MPG combined in city and highway and gives me 34 MPG on highway. You won't find many cars in its class with 201 HP, which will give you this kind of mileage. The overall build of this car is great, with superior quality. Don't waste $3000 for a nav, just pay $200 and get a nice nav. Proud & happy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The list can go on and on. USB interface for iPod and USB drives, memory/heated/comfortable seats, gas mileage, auto-day and night mirror, turn indicators, passenger mirror drops when in reverse, pedal shifters on the steering wheel, Bluetooth, HID Xenon headlights, sound system, one touch sunroof.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I decided on the TSX after test driving and pricing all the cars in its class. The TSX was the best bang for the buck bar none. My only complaint is the front grill of the car. Which can be easily fixed with some aftermarket tuning (this is why Hondas are GREAT!). The steering is fine, the power is fine, and the interior was probably the best. A lot of people are dinging this car, but what do they expect? They want Acura to give them the power of a g35/is350 at a fraction of the cost? Get real. For what i paid for this car i'd be lucky to get a base is250/328i, and what fun would that be? </TEXT>

<TEXT>Most things are fantastic! The ride is good but brake stopping distance is a bit much for a mid-sized 4 cyl. Fuel mileage is excellent, I am getting 26/34 overall. Stereo system is good but I prefer to listen to my music and not be bathed in it! The CD changer functions well but takes up too much interior space. The cup-holders in the door sills are crappy: make sure you keep your bottle top! The storage box next to gear shift deserves a coin holder, Honda's have them. The other "holders" could not hold more than a couple of tokens. The car needs rear heat & AC. I was going to get a TL at first, but glad I did not because I could keep $10K extra. Overall an excellent value for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The nav system is great, but takes awhile to get used to. Hands-free link system is awesome. The car is built solidly. Seats adjust well, especially the driver's, and has good lumbar support. Voice commands take some getting used to. Lights are excellent, and the engines still emits some vroom!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently traded my 04 TL for the 09 TSX and I am not yet convinced I made the right choice. I chose the new TSX because the new body style somewhat resembled my old TL which I absolutely loved. Also, the TSX had great gas mileage and the price with lots of accessories was unbeatable. However,I miss the power of my old car! The TSX takes a bit longer to get going after you accelerate. The ride is not as smooth as my other Acura. Also, although the design is much bigger, it still lacks leg room in the back seat. The old TLs still had more room. All being said, I do love the look of the new TSX and I am sure I will enjoy it more as the time passes. Saving $ on gas alone is a big plus!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I recommend the Tech package. It is a bit more money but definitely worth the purchase. Overall, the vehicle has a lot to offer for the money and it is a great looking car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased our new TSX a few days ago and love it so far. Got the base model without the technology package which I felt was not worth $3000. I personally feel this car looks best in a dark color so we went with crystal black pearl with parchment interior. I traded a Nissan Altima for this car which had been reliable but I never liked the look or size of the car. The TSX reminds me of the BMW 325i that I previously owned with regards to handling and interior comfort.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I changed my mind a day before to purchase an 09 Accord EXL V6. I made a great deal on both vehicles. I only had to pay 1000 more to get a TSX. The new V6 Accord engine is new in the market with the 3/4/6 cylinder running mode. Didn't like that. Didn't know the TSX is in my price range. TSX was quieter than Accord. Better suspension, better material (leather), comes with HID, and better interior. With only $1000 difference I'm going for the TSX. The engine is slightly noisier than my 08 TL, but 4 cyl. is expected to do that.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a outstanding car. The interior quality is refined and conveys quality. Nav is easy to use and the gauges are cool looking. The ELS sound system is truly fantastic. The car has plenty of power for Its size, and when I tell people it's only a 4 cyl. They can't believe it. I personally love the new exterior look. It looks aggressive but classy. The steering is not as bad as some reviews have stated, and really you would need to be on a track to notice any difference. I will admit the ride can be a bit stiff, so if you are looking for a cushy ride, this may not be the car for you. This car has an outstanding value compared to BMW, and Audi.

<TEXT>We absolutely love our TSX. So far we have had no problems out of it. We decided to just get the Base w/auto model. Mainly because we didn't want to spend an extra $3,000 on a navigation system where as you can get a portable one for $200 at many stores. We have had it for a little over 3 months and it already has over 3,000 miles on it. One thing I do wish is that we would have waited and looked at the new TLs. Another thing is that I wish it would have is an inside fuel door release instead of having to have to push it on the outside.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the 09 TSX as a 2nd vehicle (keeping my Toyota truck because you always need a good truck around the house). The TSX is feature rich in interior technology, is well built, looks pretty good, and performs well enough, plus I'm getting about 26 mpg combined. It's not the best entry level sport sedan out there, nor the most luxurious. However, this 09 TSX gives you a good little mix of everything at a decent price: cool technology, basic sportiness, touch of luxury, great build quality, nice redesigned looks, great gas mileage. When all combined together, it's a pretty good balance. Happy with the purchase so far, especially when others around the same class cost more $$.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having owned this car for less than a week, I can tell you it was a better choice than the other cars that I have researched (VW CC, Camry XLE, Altima 2.5SL and Hybrid, Maxima S). My goal was to find a car that was the best bang for a price range of $25-30k. In the end, the TSX had the most features for your dollars, as well as a luxury feel and quality. The only negative is the premium fuel requirement. The other thing I will need to get use to is the seating requires you to lean back more than I am use to (comfortable feeling but different from the other cars). I hope to put in another review after a few months of use.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my new TSX over labor day, trading in both a leased '05 RL and a Mazda 3 wagon. I was a hair's breadth away from buying a V6 Accord, but decided to go for the extra bells and whistles of the TSX. Someone told me I'd just bought a $32,000 iPod accessory (which may have a grain of truth). While I think the car has plenty of power, and I love the gas mileage, the poor little engine thrashes and complains under even moderate load. I took it to the dealer complaining that the engine was knocking (it was really that bad!), but they said to just use Shell or Chevron premium. That didn't really help. I expected better from Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am now on my 2nd TSX. I leased my first one in 05 and just recently proceeded to my second. At first I was a little unhappy due to it being somewhat bigger. After having it one week I was already in favor of the size. It is amazing how much smoother the ride is due it being a little wider and longer. I already knew it was built off the previous TL frame. When I drove it off the lot it had 280 miles on it. It now has 1200 on it and I've only filled the tank twice. I purchased the manual this time and the gas mileage is amazing! They say the auto. is to get better mileage, I don't think so! I got 450 on my first tank, 450 on my second! Go buy it! Seriously!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife's car, but I drive it frequently. For the most part, I like it and it is a nice step up from the RSX she had. My one complaint is the driver's seat lumbar support... it hits just too high on the back and it isn't really possible to dial it back enough to really find a comfortable setting for the seat. This would not be my choice of car for a longer journey. Otherwise, it is quiet, plenty powerful, and offers good road feel. Steering is a little light but one gets used to it. I'd prefer an easier to read set of dash readouts.... black on gray isn't as good as my Accord which has brighter displays.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a very good car, but I chose the wrong one. The seats are very comfortable, looks good inside and out, trans is smooth, and braking smooth. But this car has a terrible ride. The suspension is way too stiff, especially the rear suspension. Who ever heard of a car with a rear suspension that is stiffer than the front? This car jiggles everywhere and no my tires are not overinflated. For short trips this is ok, but so uncomfortable and exhausting on any long drive. Also the steering is too hard, with no feel for the road. I will sell it soon and buy a smoother riding car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car with very good gas mileage. The handling is very good (think front wheel drive Bimmer). This is not a fast car but can still be fun. Steering: everyone seems to knock it, If you only drive German cars you might be disappointed but for an Asian car it is on par and does not bother me. Maybe Acura will do a software update and make it a bit more firm and on center. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Downers: navi glare, fuel economy 27.5 highway only (mountains). Car is overwhelming in first 24 hours, but quickly becomes more fun to drive the longer I own it. The many features to learn can be intimidating.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Blue Tooth, paddle shifters, iPod interface, key fob all window open control. Car downshifts in cruise control on steep downhills saving potential speeding tickets. Great gear overlap throughout speed band.</FAVORITE>
