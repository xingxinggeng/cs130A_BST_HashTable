<TEXT>Own this car for one month. It is truly fun to drive Passat compare to other imports. Love the look inside and out. It drives like 6 cylinder car, thanks to turbo. Consequently, it consumes gas like 6 cylinder. I average 22 to 23 mi/gallon on 60 freeway/40 local. My old 2000 Maxima was better than that! I had to check the car with a local dealership for rattling noise from driver side glove box and door panel. It was fixed once and came back. So it's been at service twice for the same issue. Hope this problem won't come back. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Int/Ext look. Domestic cars can never come close to German design. Power and handling. Interior materials.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Super vehicle especially for the price. Standard features, build quality and performance is something I would expect in a much higher end vehicle, The turbo makes the gas pedal like a hair trigger on a gun, the attention to detail and quality materials is far superior to this cars competition. Something as simple as an umbrella storage compartment built into the drivers door are the small touches that really make the vehicle a standout aside from what Ive mentioned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is smooth, quiet and comfy. My wife, daughter and I are looking forward to getting out on the open road with this. This car breezes down the local freeway and streets effortlessly. Handline is precise\crisp and drives rock solid like a heavier car. The only real drawback thus far is the lack of bluetooth which is optional on Passat but comes standard in other cars. Other than that, it could use a bit more power, but for a mid size sedan the fuel economy and power are both excellent. Comfortable, plenty of leg room for a 6'5" driver with some to spare.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth slick handling and solid drivability, fuel economy, comfort, safety and visibility.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Two months after purchase, I was at the service station due to some rattling sound coming from my front bumper.Come to find out that something was coming loose. The following month, I was at the service station again due to a hissing sound that comes on each initial pull out.After these issues were fixed for free of-course, I have enjoyed every ounce of my car. Everyone who sees my Passat all say the same thing.."wow, your car is beautiful". Some think its a BMW at first sight while some say they never ever considered a VW until seeing mine. German engineering rocks but they need to understand that Americans love comfort and convenience together with reliability.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering wheel, rear & side window sunshade,sunroof opens all the way, comfortable seats, plenty storage compartments, deep black exterior paint on mine had some shiny little sparkle like things that made it stand out from other black color vehicles, SAT radio is awesome, free 3yr maintenance.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd generation Passat and my 5th VW car in the last 25 years. I have owned also recent models of Nissan Maxima, Toyota Camry, and Honda Accord. I have driven during my business trips in Europe various Mercedes cars (C200 and E300)and BMW (300, 500 series). Similarly, I drove in USA Lexus and Infinity midsize sedans. I find the Passat the most sensible combination of performance, comfort, and value. You get Audi engineering (on par with BMW and Mercedes) at discount price. The gas mileage (34-35 miles/galon) is better than that of my Toyota Camry 2005 (XLE 4). As for the reliability, it is better than my Camry 2005 so far </TEXT>

<TEXT>VW Passat is a great feat of German engineering. Autobahn for all, after all :-) The exterior is to fall in love for, interior is good and minimalistic, too but the drive feel... The steering is speed sensitive and I absolutely loved it! But... The speedometer has small numbers on it that are hard to read, so it's not clear from a quick glimpse on it whether you're making 60 or 70 km/h. The transmission is lovely, very responsive and seamless. You really cannot feel it but the engine is unrefined. Usually, I'm a big fan of smaller engines because of their efficiency, and almost limitless possibilities for improvement. But turbo lag kills me. Not responsive at all and jolty!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dashboard, transmission, suspension.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I needed to move into a larger car. Previous car was 2003 Jetta TDI sedan and I really loved it. It got great mileage and was fun to drive but not quite large enough for a growing family. We decided on the Passat Wagon because we were in no way getting a minivan nor SUV. We wanted the performance and handling of a car and not the bulk or stigma of a van or SUV. It was down to the Passat or Subaru Outback. In the end we went with the Passat as VW bank was offering 60 mos at 0%. While there may be posts out there complaining about quality, we've not seen any issues yet. The same issues were reported for my Jetta and over 5 years, few of those issues ever arose. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>2.0 T is spunky and matched with the 6 speed auto makes for lively driving. Love the way back area for the dog. Now we can carry him and have room for passengers too. Roof rails will be handy for hauling bikes etc. But of course the required attachments etc are expensive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the way this car drives. It drives better than most 6 cyl vehicles I've driven. The interior knobs have a somewhat cheap-looking appearance. Overall a good bang for your buck. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Satellite radio, good drive quality, great power on the 2.0T, 3yr free maintenance</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In general, a reasonable price/performance ratio. The reliability is bad, automatic windows, brakes, and instrument panel are replaced.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our third Passat having bought a new 1997 diesel and 2004 diesel. We love the diesels but gave up on VW ever getting the Passat diesel into North America. VW always seems to be three steps behind the marketing curve. We are quite pleased with our 2009, even though it isn't a diesel and we certainly miss that mileage. It handles beautifully but is noisier than our 2004 due to the low profile tires. We bought new tires and went one size up and the noise decreased. Our big gripe is that VW dropped Homelink from the Passat but not the Passat CC. Another braindead action by VW. Their response to my inquiry: "Our marketing plan for North America does not include the diesel or Homelink."</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>..Well designed interior ..Drive quality ..Nav system is super ..New sun shade feature</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is really a pleasant surprise. Just came out of an Infinity M45. Had to downsize lifestyle and found the perfect car.This car drives great,and is big enough for a family of five. No car can match the features this car has for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 2.0 turbo has plenty of power. Great comfort and fine interior finish. Gas mileage is great on this car too. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently bought a VW Passat 'Komfort' wagon for my wife. The car has been great so far. After 5 days in my Lexus, it's fun to drive my wife's car on the weekend. I really can't ever say I've felt that way about my other cars. If VW can solve some of it's past reliability issues ( and it looks like they are trying hard to do so) I think middle America will 'rediscover' the brand.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>tight, solid ride. Clean, teutonic look and feel. Leatherette on the wagon looks better than the real thing. Despite comments to the contrary, the 2.0T engine can use regular gas ( my friend who works for Audi let me in on that little secret since the 2.0t is borrowed from previous Audi models).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have a BMW X5 and traded a Merc C280 4 Matic for the Passat. The Passat is the exact size of an E350, but half the price. You give up rain sensing wipers, memory seats, automatic headlights and a power rear sunshade. You get just as good build quality, similar performance in crash tests, 10 more MPG, free scheduled maintenance for 3 years, and $30,000 in your pocket. The sales experience was much better than Mercedes. I have no regrets. I love this car. What will I do with my $30,000? Good time to invest.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The turbo engine, the sound system, the hold feature, the quality and design of the interior and exterior - looks like an Audi, built in Germany by 75% German parts and a Japanese Transmission, the 6 speed tiptronic transmission, the interior and cargo space, the folding rear seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far, very few problems with 09 Passat compared to 06 previously owned. Small rattle, ipod adapter issue dealership addressed immediately. 3200 miles driven since purchased. Keep checking my oil to make sure don't have same issue as 06 model. Fun to drive compared to Nissan, Honda, and Toyota family sedans. Unfortunately, my experience is that you trade performance, fit/finish for reliability. Keeping my fingers crossed...</TEXT>

<TEXT>Came out of a Volvo XC70. This car has personality and is much more fun to drive. Comfort is good. Good acceleration. Mileage is better then sticker. Easily get 30-32 at 70 mph. 33-34 at 60 mph. Average fuel mileage is 26mpg. Kids love the rear door window shade. I am 6'1" and like the front seats. Live in area that doesn't have may Passat Wagons and get many looks. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, great sound system, gas mileage, ergonomics are generally good. </FAVORITE>
