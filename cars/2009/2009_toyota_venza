<TEXT>The Venza is perfect for our current needs and has been a joy to drive in both city and rural/mountain driving. With two of three teenagers in college we no longer needed 7 seats and traded in a Honda Odyssey which we loved. But the Venza is a more luxurious car and we like the security of AWD along with all the safety features. Fit and finish are great, reliability has been perfect in the first 7000 miles. Backup camera as part of the navigation package is very helpful. Backup on its own has too small a display. Teenagers love the sound system and the MP3 plug and play capability. Looked at the Lexus RX350 but the Venza is virtually identical and is $8,000 less. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This is an excellent value given all the features and Toyota quality. Delivered price for AWD and virtually every option save the rear seat entertainment system, was $33,500. Very pleased with the combination NAV and backup camera, climate control, sound system, handling, fit and finish.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving this for only 4 months, I was really disappointed! The extremely large dash started coming apart. I had a constant loud rattling noise coming from the a/c vents on the dash which they replaced and still did not help, plus every time I would go over the slightest bump, the car had really loud squeaking coming from underneath. Well took it to the dealership to get fixed, did not work. A new car should not have those issues at 2800 miles already. Plus it is really loud inside, lots of road noise. Needless to say, traded it in for the new 2010 Buick LaCrosse. Now I am happy! Toyota just does not have the quality construction it once did. Lost it for me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It was roomy inside, like the auto open on the hatch back.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my 4 cyl. Venza for two weeks now and am very happy. I did a lot of research on vehicles in this class and selected the Venza because it had the best mileage in its class and because of historical Toyota reliability. I test drove both the V6 and V4 and did not notice much of a difference in the way they drove. Everything is within reach and the base vehicle most of the extras included. I am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a small SUV/crossover vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats are very comfortable and vehicle has tons of room in front as well as rear seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I came out of an 07 F-150, so I won't compare apples to oranges. I love the responsive steering. The V6 has quite the pickup, particularly on the highway. It's easy to lose track of how fast you're going, as the drive is very smooth. Love all the gadgets and cubbies for stuff. I have a bad back so seating is important to me. This seat is very comfy and easy to adjust. My son says the back seat is more comfortable than my husband's Lincoln Town Car! Very happy with my new car. (My boss wasn't too happy as I work at a Ford dealership!) Not many of these around yet, so I get lots of looks and questions. Highly recommend this vehicle!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Zippy engine, comfy seats (front and back) smart key feature, JBL stereo rocks! Power rear door, bluetooth phone thing is awesome!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We are empty nester, baby boomers that wanted easier entry than our former Acura MDX but with creature comforts, decent performance, good reliability, upright seating, cargo capacity for our dogs and stuff and some style. The Venza suited us better than any of the alternatives we tested. We were seduced by a loaded Venza in Blizzard Pearl. The price was still less than our Acura MDX in 2001. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ease of entry, comfortable and spacious seats, ample cargo and storage space, HID headlights, good JBL audio system with Bluetooth, back-up camera in Navigation screen, sunroof brightens interior and looks good, and uses regular gas.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Good room and nice ride but steering uncomfortable, perhaps because of 20" tires. Dash is massive and makes vehicle feel huge and more like an RV. Good cargo room with or without rear seats down. Good pep and fairly agile for size. Been driving a BMW X3 and wanted more cargo room, which this has but handling just doesn't compare, even though ride a bit smoother. Sloped front end makes parking a bit of a challenge in tight spaces until accustomed to it. Feels a bit like driving one of the giant sedans of the 60's. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roominess, ride. Priced well to compete with SUV market.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I decided to buy a Venza after renting a Camry in California. We wanted a car that was SUV-like, but more of a sedan interior. We have a Honda Pilot which we both like very much, and we thought the Venza would give us sedan characteristics with some SUV features. We were right in making the decision to buy the Venza. It has exceeded our expectations. We love the ride and handling. The mileage on two trips has been between 26 and 30 mpg. It is extremely comfortable for both my wife and I. I'm 6'4" and she's 5'2'. We both fit the car nicely. We chose the sunroof option and I have no problem with headroom. The V6 has way more zip than the 4 cyl that we test drove.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Our faves are the acceleration. The great handling on curvy roads. The auto tailgate has been very handy while shopping and traveling. Plenty of space to pack items for a long trip. The nav system is one of our favorite features. Satellite radio with traffic warnings works well too. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Venza when my Lexus 2007 350ES lease ended. Once I took a test drive, I decided on the spot to buy the one on display--4 cyl Blizzard Pearl and fully loaded. This is such a terrific car for in-town and road trips. I put 5000 miles on it the first 6 weeks! Love every feature. 15 min after I drove away from the dealer, I parked at a shopping center and got asked, "What is that??? I love that car!" Hardly ever see others on the road, but I couldn't be happier to own this Venza. Have had Mercedes, BMWs, Volvos, Lexus in the past, and this is my favorite. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather seats, NAV system, SAT radio, 2 moonroofs, A/C, roomy interior and plenty of leg and head room, power hatch, keyless entry and ignition,black floormats, back-up camera, smooth and quiet ride, # of cup holders, regular gas consumption! Fair price for so much luxury, safety, and comfort.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the Venza and would recommend it to everyone. My husband and I just came from a 200 mile trip and it was great!! The weather was BAD --but the Venza didn't mind it at all, no problems and the navagations was sooo very helpful, over all I have a lot of faith in the Venza. I only have it for 1 and half months. I can't think it would give me any problems. In the next 6 months I will let you know if I have any problems --I have a lot of faith in it and don't think I will.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything--When I go in the car I don't have to jump up--not like the SUV's but it's still higher then the Sedans. The back is just right for my dogs (2) and the is big enough for all 4 of us. The window is perfect size not to big or small --the steering is soo easy and parking is the best--</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my car a little over a week and I couldn't be more pleased. Last year I bought a Honda Accord EX-L that I could not sell fast enough. Before the Honda I had a SAAB for 9 years that I loved. Since SAAB wagon was out of the question this time I looked for a wagon to replace it. The only thing available last year was too big for me. This crossover is perfect. The drive, the JBL, the Panoramic Roof, and over all comfort. The driver and passenger seating is roomy. I have all the features on the car except the NAV. and DVD. I have enjoyed all the features. The brakes are stiff but that is better than too sensitive. I am looking forward to low maintenance unlike the SAAB.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned this car(new) 1 day and the SRS warning lights went off and they continue to go off intermittently. 5 days after purchase, along with the SRS light, the VSC(skid) lights are appearing. 6 days after purchase, the dealer doesn't know what to do and I am asked to bring the car back for an undisclosed amount of time. They will provide a loaner. I read the Tundra complaints on this and they are the same. The lights were not on when I took it back for service and they said they couldn't do anything for me unless they saw the lights. After turning the car on&off 100+ times, they saw the light and have the code (s). We will see what they do/say but so far, I am not happy. Will post update. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Decent but not great</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Smooth if no bumps on the road. But you can feel the bumps. It is not luxious, but comfortable enough. The seat is a little hard (nylon seat). It is not as comfortable as my old camry. The seats are definitely big. Definitely roomy. Good exterior and interior design. The plastic material inside is cheap. Decent mpg for a large car. Mine is 4 cylinder and the computer read out is 24.7 mpg, not sure how accurate it is. 4 cylinder is not that powerful, but good enough for daily commute. Passanger seats and backseats are very roomy and comfortable. It took me a while to get used to different control knots in the front panel.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plenty of room inside. It provides a comfortable ride except bumps on the road. Price is right at $25,500 for the base model with 4 cylinders. It could be a little cheaper. The front lights are bright.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only had the car for 1 day but want to give my initial impressions and will update later. This car is a good composition of beauty, comfort and fun to drive. The car corners well, there is plenty of room for the driver and passengers. I have the blizzard white and it is much prettier than the blue, green and red that I have seen. I have not seen the other colors. The dealer that I purchased it from was more than fair, very respectful and made the experience fun. I would recommend both the car and the dealer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was shopping to replace my 07 Highlander. The 09 Highlander was simply too big. I saw the Venza and gave it a test drive. It's a great car. The Toyota people know what they are doing. The Venza is well designed, very comfortable, fun to drive, well made, great on gas, and priced well. It's actually a station wagon (remember those?) for modern drivers. Toyota hit a home run. This is a no-brainer.</TEXT>

It hauls 4 people and golf clubs with no problem. We have the Blizzard Pearl and it really draws the looks and comments. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Features like Keyless Go, Bluetooth (Stereo and Hands-Free Cellular), Automatic Tailgate, Remote Folding Seat Lever, 20 in wheels, and rear-view camera make this a great value. The ride is nice and sedan-like. The wide stance makes it very stable. The stated fuel economy puts it among the best in its class. The fit and finish is like a Lexus. We've owned BMW, Landrover and this meets or exceeds them both. The legroom could be better in the back, but it is OK. You could spend 60k for all of this and not get as refined a package. The resale should be OK too. This is our first Toyota, so we will see about that.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded in our 2007 Camry SE v-6 to purchase the Venza after my wife saw it and felt it was the hatchback she had been looking for. The Camry, I feel, never got the recognition it deserved for being a true hot rod both in sheer speed and handling while also being quite docile in everyday driving. The Venza is like a Camry wagon with the same drive train, length and same suspension as the SE model. The Venza is well appointed and with a few options added, is really nice. The size of the vehicle is just right for most, the seating is very comfortable, and even the six speaker stereo (which we have) is clean and crisp in sound. Sitting next to my built '77 Cherokee provides quite a contrast.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auto climate control, drive train, seating, and the really big 20" wheels! My Tundra 4x4 with 33's has 16's and my Jeep with 35's has 15's. I'd imagine the tires are expensive to replace. The many cubbies and the sliding center console are really cool too. The pearl paint is beautiful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Comfortable and sleek, fun to drive! What I like most about this car is the spacious interior and uncommon looks of exterior design. Also, it drives comfortably and handles nicely. What I don't like about it is that I hear some noise during sudden acceleration, and hard to change lanes and make turns during traffic. Still, I think the VENZA is fantastic car because it drives like Camry and rides high like SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great vehicle to look at but rides like a jeep! It has a lot of wind noise around the windows.Think before you buy this. And drive it more than 15 minutes when thinking of purchasing. We paid 32,000 which is pricey for a poor ride. Also, under driver's seat after you drive a while on a road trip I felt what seemed like a bar under the driver's seat.

<TEXT>Powerful on acceleration, all wheel drive for various weather conditions, reasonable gas mileage, up to date electronics, plenty of interior space for 5 adult passengers and a nifty interior and exterior design all go into making our V6 AWD Venza a real pleasure to drive.

<TEXT>Toyota doesn't bring out many new vehicles but when it does it's time to pay attention. First impressions were great and when I bought the venza I was not disappointed. It's got the styling, drives like a car but is practical like an suv. The venza has a ton of neat features-power rear door, back up camera, storage compartment and accessory holders... The list goes on. My one concern was the blindspots but it has not been an issue. The awd is great in the snow too, no need to throw on winter tires every year. This vehicle fits all my needs and with Toyota reliabilty and strong resale value I look forward to years of enjoymeat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a stylish comfortable Camry wagon. No pretenses of a rear seat (hello cramped RAV4 third row) and no pretending to be an SUV or crossover or whatever you try to call it other than a station wagon. Yeah they try to call this a crossover too, but we all really know it is a Camry wagon. The lines are classy, the interior is well designed and uses quality materials, and the totally predictable handling and bulletproof reliability are great for those who don't like any surprises. Venza gets you from point A to point B with comfort, good-looks and a minimum of fuss or effort.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife would not give up her matrix XRS without a nose bashing bleeding fight. Guile and love on my part got her to try out the Venza and it was love on first sight. If you travel two or three long trips a year yet need conveyance that won't tire both your wallet and patience and combine camping with urban driving, while keeping the kids happy, then this is the car for you. My wife was never one to enjoy attention but even she likes the looks she is getting. and the kids look up through the roof in the rear and all you hear is silence. Need I say more. All you parents out there at least give it a look over, this car (suv?) does not need a salesman.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Downsizing from a suburban I was looking for something smaller, yet would still have the suv characteristics. The Venza is easy to get in and out of. I love the power of the v6 and with AWD it really goes through deep snow.The rear seats are comfortable even for adults which is rare in most suvs. The drive is very smooth and the large speedometer makes it easy to avoid tickets. It seems to be a very safe winter car as I have yet to lose traction. Toyota claims you do not get your pant leg dirty on the door sill, yes it works well. The transmission shifts are smooth and I rarely feel them. Dual temp controls are a bonus as my wife and I set at different temps. The dealer treated us nicely.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power hatch release is great. I use it all the time. I also like how the rear view mirror changes at night time so you do not get the blinding lights in your eyes. The acceleration of the v6 is quick, it performs like a v8 and it is very quiet. AWD is great as there is no buttons to press.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Smooth and in control. Easy maneuvering, enjoyable very smooth steering, precise. Braking and acceleration just as great. All driver controls from the steering wheel to the easy no-reach dashboard are wonderful. Turning and cornering feels very stable, safe, and smooth. The gear shift is exactly where it should be, easy to reach, natural. Solid comfort. So easy to "crossover" from an Avalon to my Venza. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smart key, steering and total comfort. Optional space with fold down back seats. Ability to buy a much more affordable car versus the Lexus or Mercedes crossover. If you're debating between the regular stereo system versus the JBL surround, stereo is fantastic, sound is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just picked up my Venza yesterday. It rides really smooth, I didn't get the moonroof with Nav option. But its fully loaded with everything else plus I received some free accessory items that I didn't expect. It has fast pickup, plenty of legroom, heated seats and a great dashboard that will tell you everything from gas mileage info to temperature info. Comes with the Satellite system free for 3 months. Buttons are right by your hands, so you don't have to stretch over anywhere. Futuristic design on the body, very different. Lots of cargo room and has bigger tires than your usual standard car. Lighted dashboard at night very well illuminated and bright. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Venza yesterday; 3.5L V6, FWD, and I absolutely love it. I bought it to replace 2 cars, an 03 Solara and an 07 Camry... Loved how the Solara handled, & liked the look of the Camry. With the Venza, now I get both in one package. The handling is very responsive, smooth, and the turn radius is a lot sharper than I expected for it's size. The JBL 13-speaker system upgrade is definitely worth it if you are an audiophile and love music, & there is no doubt that the interior was designed to be the visual definition comfortable and convenient. The smart key is great, so you can keep the keys in your pocket while you lock, unlock, start & stop the car.. all via touch.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the Bluetooth option, w/ the ability to dial by name or number, and auto-sync on car entry. I love the convenience of the smart key, because I know as long as I have the key on me, I have full access and control of the car. The drive is solid and responsive, and the design is nice all around.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this 6cy AWD explicitly for very long drives along the Great Lakes Snowbelt in winter - dangerous conditions. I held my nose while considering SUVs and minivans. This car was a reasonable compromise. The seat is firm and surprisingly comfortable on a 500 mile drive. The vehicle handles firmly and assertively unlike Toyota's other models. I call it a vanagon; it felt large at first, but it really is more like a tall sedan than anything else. I have a black one with that ridiculously toothy chrome grill, which seems to be a desirable feature on higher-end vehicles. But it goes like a tank in the snow and hauls a medium amount of stuff. Expect good resale from it and I feel safe.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Needed the ease of entering and exiting vehicle that a SUV offers rather then sitting down into a sedan. This was the perfect choice. In between a sedan and SUV. Picked it up last week, first one sold at dealer. Impressed with design and performance. The base model comes with all the features you would expect to pay more for in Camry LE.

<TEXT>Purchased a black loaded 2wd Venza. Pretty much everything is on it. Extremely nice to drive. Replaced a 2007 Camry V6 Limited. Navigation is much improved. JBL stereo is also much better then previous model. Handles pretty well for a tall vehicle, Automatic high beams is kind of unusual, takes some getting used to. So far we both love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We picked up our new Venza yesterday, 3.5 V-6, AWD, leather, nav, tow pkg - all options except rear DVD. Very impressive vehicle, outstanding build quality inside and out, solid handling and cornering, fast (0-60 in 6.8 sec) excellent ride, reasonable mileage as near as we can determine, but it's a bit early for numbers. The nav and audio are a lot more user friendly and better integrated than the system in our '05 Odyssey. The floor is flat for easy entry/exit and the rocker panels are totally covered by the doors. Clever touch, especially for the gals, keeps your clothes clean in rainy conditions. Dual moon roof adds a large rear non-opening panel. A crossover-wagon mix, excellent. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav-audio-Bluetooth integration, back seat room (scads of it), dual moonroof, innovative door design and construction, excellent power and ride, System display panel centered under windshield prevents driving distraction.

<TEXT>This is a vehicle whose time has come. It is exactly what I was looking for in 01 when I bought my Highlander. It is loaded with all the latest Toyota features and has all the utility of an SUV without the SUV downsides. If my test drive was any indication, I'm going to really enjoy this vehicle. The fit and finish are superior (what we used to expect from Toyota). And it comes without the hefty price tag of the new SUVs.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ride: Have driven on I76, I80, I 90, I190, I78, I70, I86, Route 22 central PA and really it's all smooth drive except for some bumps on I 86. Pickup: Good. Did well on the ups and downs of the Alleghenies. Noise: I contradict on the critics comments on the wind & road noise- Driving at 65mph and can hear the crisp and crystal clear music at level 6-7 maybe the premium JBL system (std on venza) is the performer. Engine & Mileage: V6 is powerful but fuel efficient. Driving between 50 mph-65 mph highway will give an avg fuel consumption of 27-29 mpg... isn't it wonderful!!! Tire: noise is also very low (have 20" Michelin). Seats: Leather seats are comfortable for a 4-5 hour dive at a stretch.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this beautiful car for 2 reasons: No trunk to lift out of and better gas mileage. I had a Cadillac DeVille and I averaged 25-27 MPG on the road and thought Toyota would give me better. Wrong!!! I only average 20.9 on a highway trip. I also have a "Thump" sound which seems to come from the right rear but the dealership cannot find any problem. Being a single woman, I really have my fears that the noise could be something to do with the wheels on the back and dangerous. The plastic on the dash and steering wheel could certainly be improved. It is a nice car, drives wonderful, turning base is great but the MPG makes me wish I had my Cadillac back.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the Venza for over 1000 mi. now and I am impressed with its power, room, versatility, and ease of driving. The fuel economy is good, I average about 21 around town, 27 on the highway. Really like the sunroof and push button start, the power rear door is helpful with the kids and large packages. Yes, the ride is taughter than other Toyotas, and you do sit higher than in a Camry or Avalon, but that's the design. It's not a wallowing, bucking SUV that gets 15 mpg and can't take a turn or accelerate well, that's for sure. And it's no minivan that is more of an appliance than a fun to drive vehicle. A few gaps and misaligned seams in the dash, other than that, I really like it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I finally pulled the trigger and bought the car 2 days ago. The V6 AWD version has plenty of power and the 20" wheels are not as bad as I read in the reviews; this car really turns heads. The ride is still on the firm side but Toyota managed to compensate it with the suspension design. The interior is very well thought of with all the amenities you can ever need including 3 power outlets. The smart key system is fantastic and cabin space is very generous. My average MPG is probably about 20 with mixed driving, not the best but no worries since I only drive 10 miles to work. All in all it's a wonderful and fully functional crossover that I am pleased with and will keep for a very long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have found the VENZA to be an excellent all around car. The looks are youthful and classy together. The inside (w/leather pkg, incl woodlike trim) is actually beautiful. Agonized over 4 vs 6 and am so glad I got the 4. While not a screamer, this 4 jumps like a rabbit from standstill, 40-60 and even passing at 60-70. Performance with the 4-cyl was a pleasant surprise, and hwy mileage of 29 (!) is fabulous for a car this big. Ride is quiet and smooth and handling is also very good, esp for a big wagon. Overall its got looks, quality and performance. The car reeks of quality. Put a big "L" on it and it could be a Lexus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just purchased the vehicle and as other people have said the car is very versatile and nicely made. However we are greatly disappointed in the ride quality. We did not take the car on the freeway during our test drive which was a big mistake. The Venza picks up every nook and cranny on the highway/road. Of course the roads in California are poorly maintained and made. It is running the 19 inch wheels and Bridgestone Hueler Tires which from website reviews are not good tires. The Venza bounces back and forth and up and down to the point it almost undriveable. We use to have a Nissan Murano which drove twice as good. I wish I could take it back and get back our old IS300 Lexus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded a 2008 Accord for this Venza, much less road noise than the Honda. The front seat comfort is excellent. We get the same gas mileage in a 4 cylinder as we did in the Accord. First two trips on a fresh engine got us 28.8, so its right on the 29 sticker. Plus no more brake problems like all late model Accords. Love the comfort and room. The back seat is one of the most comfortable of any I have ever sat in. 4 cylinder has plenty of power and the V6 is just plain fast for a family size car. Plus, it just looks great. Very modern and stylish. Would recommend to anyone.</TEXT>

It had a phenomenal amount of safety features and was able to make it out of our steep driveway due to the 8 inch ground clearance... When we drove it we were impressed by the feel of the car and by the overall design... At this pricepoint other vehicles don't come close... It can never replace our Mercedes but it is giving us a great safe ride and a big bang for out buck!</TEXT>

Its the best of both worlds. Handles and accelerates like a sports car but will pull my motorcycle trailer and has plenty of room to haul things.

<TEXT>Last vehicle was an '07 fully loaded extended cab Tacoma. Went into the dealer to buy a "double cab" Tacoma and saw the Venza. While I was talking to the salesperson I kept turning to look at the venza and the rest is history. This is an absolute fantastic vehicle. Love the AWD. I bought this cross-over with everything I wanted. The only things I didn't get were the panoramic roof and heated seats. I've heard of a problem or two, but to date I have had only one. The bluetooth is a problem with the new blackberry tour and I'm currently looking for a repair. Other than that this vehicle has operated beautifully. I too usually do not buy first year cars, but Toyota's quality changed my mind.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this Venza for my wife. Traded in our 2005 Honda Odyssey for a what I thought was a smaller vehicle. To our surprise, the Venza is very spacious. Yes, we do not have the third row seating, but we only used it when family was visiting. The first time I test drove it, I was hooked. Very comfortable, smooth ride and a quiet cabin. The interior is very comfortable and Toyota spared no expense in the design. It is the best interior I have seen. I opted for the 6 cylinder. Let me tell you, if you are not watching what you are doing, you can find yourself traveling at 75-80 mph with no effort at all. The first time I passed a car on a two lane road caught me off guard with the great power. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I perhaps am different that most, as I purchased this car to essentially carry stuff as I'm a weekend musician and needed a car capable of carrying quite a bit of equipment. I hate mini-vans and SUV's are horrible in terms of load-in and load-out (plus drive AWFULLY) so this or a Subaru were it. This car does what I wanted it for quite well. I didn't initially care for the handling of the car, as it feels heavy to me, but once I became used to the car it drove quite well. It drives quite well fully loaded with equipment as well as filled with adults. The stereo sounds great, the bluetooth and nav work well and the care is very comfortable. The more I drive it, the more I like the car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1. The V6 is well powered, not fast, but quick. 2.

The 20" wheels do make for a little harshness, but big bumps are taken in stride. Don't even think about getting the four cylinder engine.

<TEXT>I am surprised by how much I like the Venza. My numeric ratings are based on comparison to peer vehicles. It is comfortable to drive and is very comfortable for passengers. My wife and I made a 2,000 mile round trip from Central TX to Phoenix. We experienced 26 MPG on this highway trip and cruised at 80 MPH during large stretches of the trip. The Venza is also a good day-to-day vehicle. It is quite capable of hauling small to mid-size items (groceries to small furniture items). Acceleration is surprisingly good. It feels "heavy" during cornering. The electronics (Navigation and stereo) are good. The ride is solid. Cabin noise is quiet up to about 65 MPH and never too loud.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We spent a long time deciding between the Venza and the Lexus RX 350, Audi Q5, Infiniti EX35 and Volvo XC60. While the Venza is a crossover, these others are small luxury SUVs and are priced similarly-equipped at about a $10K higher sticker price. We have not been disappointed by the initial quality, ride and features in our vehicle. My only serious complaint about the vehicle is the quality of the plastic used in the lower half of the dashboard; it says "Corolla" more than luxury and this is about the only oversight I have found. Otherwise, I suspect we have as much a car as the ones listed above, but at a significantly more economical price. I am very happy with my choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Taking advantage of Cash for Clunkers, I traded in my Nissan Xterra and Toyota Camry Hybrid. I liked the Venza because it was similar to the Camry and I knew that I would have a short learning curve for Navigation, etc. The seats are quite comfortable and the Navigation has nice voice-controlled update from the Camry. Love the 20" wheels and the AWD. Obviously, mileage is less than the Hybrid, but for the V6, it is not bad. Still breaking in the engine and trying not to go over 55 mph on highway, but sometimes, I get carried away. Smooth engine and lots of power.</TEXT>

Like most people we asked what it was and had to take it for a test drive. The ride is smoother than a crossover and has better handling. The increased height makes for easy in and out and overall visibility. Combined gas mileage is about 24 and the 4-cylinder engine has plenty of power for us. Got it with the comfort package which includes the keyless ignition and remote liftgate as well as powered driver's seat with great lumbar support.

<TEXT>After 1 month the mileage has been 22 city and 29 highway. The mileage computer is not as accurate as my calculator but it is close enough. Plenty of room inside and materials are of respectable quality. Venza handles well in town and on the road. The ride is a bit choppy on the road compared with the Volvo wagon it replaced, but is an OK ride. The in town ride is smooth and awesome. Very happy with Venza and would recommend it to anyone.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smart key, sound system (base) info system, and the high stance of the Venza. Loads of carrying capacity, and plenty of leg room for the rear seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is one of the more pleasurable cars I have owned recently (owned several including CX7 traded for this car). If you would call it negative, the ride could be more plush & I am dismayed that no optional wheels are offered as well as the Memory function for the seats/mirrors. Gas mileage is very good & I keep a log of gas used.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The gas mileage is exceptional, I get 19/20mpg in city driving & so far, 26.1mpg for highway driving (over 100 miles). Acceleration-did not know how fast it was when I purchased the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My Venza was silky smooth the first week. Loved it! Then the annoying grinding noise from the transmission occurred when starting in the morning with every shift. The technician said that it was normal in a morning cold/cool start. The grinding sound became worse and worse. Now the venza won't move when start in the morning, on reverse, or drive for up to a minute, while the VDC light up on the dashboard. Have to turn it off and restart. Very disappointed. Other owners reported similar problems. Will take the car to dealer to have it checked out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have wanted a Venza since I first read about them. I have had the car for a 10 days and it was worth the wait. I love the interior room. The V- 6 provides plenty of power. It is a very smooth ride. My biggest surprise has been the gas mileage. I got 23 1/2 mpg on my first tank. This was about 4 mpg better than my 03 Highlander. I usually would not buy a car in its first year of release, but since it was a Toyota product I felt it would be reliable I decided to make an exception and get the car. So far I am glad I did. This is an amazing vehicle. It handles like a car and retains the versatility of an SUV with better gas mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the leather seats, the sound system, the power and how the car handles. The options including Homelink are very nice. The vehicle was well thought out.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Perfect car to travel with because of its cargo arrangement options and seating space. The comfort of the passenger seat was of utmost importance to us. The seat is broad enough, has enough leg room, and recline capabilities so the passenger has positional options during a trip. However it has one defeat-if books or grocery bags are placed on the front passenger seat the seat belt signal sounds. Wish the passenger could do map tracking to specific hotels, food, etc. while the car is being driven from area to area. This would be wonderful for spur of the moment decisions while driving along. Wish the width of the back cargo space immediately behind the back seat was the same as at door area.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Nicely loaded vehicle for the price you pay. Except for the memory seats and mirrors. Biggest peeve! Brand new car with streaming bluetooth capability (A2DP) will not pair with most new phones. Toyota running with bluetooth 1.2. Bluetooth 2.0 has been out for so long. So I paid for JBL Navigation package for the bluetooth and it is useless. Toyota dealer indicated that the venza bluetooth can't be upgraded. However, I know that other dealers have released hardware and software upgrades to make their bluetooth systems 2.0! Disappointed in Toyota. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Good News: if you are looking to buy this car, don't be swayed by the occasional bad review.I don't know what those people are thinking.You just can't please some of the people most of the time. This is a very enjoyable and comfortable car to drive.I researched this car for 4 months, and drove it 5 times before I bought it, and I fell in love with it from the first moment I drove it. Have had it about a month and took it on a 400 mi. trip, and it was a total dream to drive on a trip, and no less pleasurable around town. I have had some rattle/noise problems, but they are being addressed. There is plenty of power with the 4 cyl and better gas mileage for sure. This car is a dream!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Venza is my favorite vehicle out there. Awesome body style, fantastic interior, roomy, great safety ratings and reliable Toyota name. Critics have knocked points off of it because it lacks 3rd row seating. I LOVE this about it. I have 3 kids and no one wants to be the person who sits in the way back of a vehicle (in 3rd row seating) which are usually uncomfortable. A sedan seemed too small, minivan was too big and suv's were usually too ugly, big or just simply didn't appeal to me. I was going to get the Honda Ridgeline until I saw this and fell in love with it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior design, the dark gray color, the black flooring (I have 3 kids), all the standard options, I like how they have their packages, the size of it ... what isn't there to like about it (besides the 2 mentioned things). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Like all Toyotas, my Venza is flawless. Styling in and out is beautiful. I am very surprised by the performance of the 2.7L. Mileage is exactly what Toyota claimed. Power is much better than expected. If you're in the market for a Venza take a close look at the 2.7L. I bought the basic Venza and it has more standard equipment than any car I've ever owned. My Toyota Venza isn't the most exciting car on the road. It isn't the fastest. It isn't the most luxurious. It's not the prettiest (but darn close). But if you're looking for a great value for you money and looking for a car that is really pretty, built well that does everything that is advertised, take a hard look at the Toyota Venza.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the 2.7L. Styling in and out is outstanding. Air conditioning with duel control (standard) is excellent. Fit and finish is flawless. Ride is great. Fun to drive. Well thought out car. Excellent mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The reviews are true, if you want a car like ride, with the space of a SUV this is it. I looked at Rav4, CRV, Lexus, Cx7 and I settled on the Venza. It fitted in correct price, space and MPG, quite well thought and marketed at the right spot. Interior feels like a Lexus. Has Toyota brand name and reliability, though early to say since it debuted in 2009, so far happy with it. I went for the 4cyl, FWD since gas mileage is important. Test drove both V6 and 4cyl, and 4cyl fitted to my lifestyle needs, getting ~24 in the city. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased the new 2009 Venza, 3.5, V6, AWD, Black with roof rack, cloth seats on 24 June 2009. A nice looking ride and easy to dive. Fuel economy supposed to be 18 to 25 MPG. Just a few days the best MPG so far is 12.5. Also seating is very firm and hard on the bottom. Suggest future years Toyota put in a more comfortable seat. In addition, suggest this great looking car have memory front seating for the driver and passenger. I've read all the reviews on this vehicle and many other people have stated the same recommendations: (memory seating to include side view mirrors and more comfortable seating. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Proud owner of a FWD V6 Venza w/ premium package for over a month. Ride isn't as bad as others have complained -- we do feel some of the bumps on the road, but it's nothing to lose sleep over. Storage capacity is incredible; we've taken ours for a 1200km shopping trip and was able to load quite a bit of stuff in the rear. Fuel economy is alright, considering it's a v6 (avg about 23mpg mostly city so far). The amount of power & torque in the V6 is pretty amazing; I'm not surprised if this thing can do 0-60 in 6.5 secs! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Dealership experience good. This very nice car has been spoiled by inferior power steering, which has a "sticks" in the neutral (straightforward) position. I tried another identical model which had the same problem. The dealership said this was due to the "new"electronic power steering, and they and Toyota told me it could not be rectified. My previous car the Lexus Rx had perfect steering. It is a shame that they did not use the same steering on the Venza. As a result I would not recommend the Venza to buyers of this class of car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy interior, quiet comfort, and ease of accessibility of spare wheel. Good gas consumption, presently 20 plus in town. With only 2000 miles I am unable to give an opinion on reliability, but expect it will be up to the standards of my old Lexus Rx.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I shopped across multiple categories, but in the end, it was between the Venza, Highlander, Nissan Murano and Lexus RX (09 and 10). I didn't need a 3rd row, which is the Highlander's primary advantage. I almost went with the Murano back in '08 when it was released. However, a fully- equipped LE was in the $35-40K range. The RX was the most luxurious, but it wasn't worth the premium over the Venza. YMMV. In the end, the Venza was the right mix of the strengths of each candidate: utility (Highlander); unique style (Murano); and luxury (RX) at a lower relative price- point.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 4 Cyl. Venza drives and sounds like no other car that I have ever owned. It glides along like you might imagine an electric car will drive like. It has enough power for safe driving but certainly not enough to satisfy those that are looking for a sports car feel. The exterior & interior design are excellent in my book. The car does get people looking at it, as you drive along. The cabin feels much larger than it actually is due to the very high roof. Bottom Line ...it is a nice vehicle for those tired of owning another SUV. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been in love with this car since it debuted at the Detroit Auto Show in Jan, 2008. I wanted an upscale car with just two rows of seats, but with the cargo area of an SUV. This fits my needs perfectly. I've got almost 1000 miles on it now and I look for excuses to take it out for a drive. It's easier to get in and out of than my former SUV, but I'm sitting higher than in a car. The front hood slopes so that all you see in front of you is road and I feel like I have good vision all the way around. The transmission is silky smooth and it has more than enough power. Getting ready for a trip this weekend I appreciated the low load-in height in the cargo area. Fantastic car!! </TEXT>

The car is very quick particularly on the highway, even when towing my 3,000 lb. boat. The 4WD is a great plus at the boat launch ramp and in the winter. So far I have averaged about 21 MPG.

<TEXT>Prior to this car, I had a Rav4 which I liked. Then My wife bought an Avalon and after one drive, I had trouble enjoying the Rav anymore! I decided it was time for a new ride, but another Avalon didn't make sense because I have a bad back and it is hard for me to get in and out. I wanted something with a ride height similar to a Rav, and the luxury of the Avalon. As soon as I sat in the Venza, I knew it was what I was looking for. The test drive sealed the deal. It has the same 6 cyl as the Avalon, which I really like, and AWD which I insist on with all my cars. The interior is huge, and the ride is as good as the Camry even with the 20" wheels. The 6 speed trans is silky smooth. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Venza is a solid vehicle hampered by a few glaring defects. The fuel economy is good, but could have been improved by putting on 17 or 18in tires. I have no idea what Toyota was thinking when they mounted 19in tires on the 4 cylinder and 20in tires on the 6 cylinder. Replacement tires for the 19's are currently limited to the original tires. I can only hope Toyota received a great kickback for these terrible tires. I truly hate them. As a tall driver, I find the wideness of the center center console impedes my comfort. The good thing for Toyota is that these items are resolvable.</TEXT>

Better mileage, excellent view for drivers that like to sit a little higher on the road. The comfort of seats was equal to a Lincoln we tried out before buying the Venza. Just a great vehicle, but probably built for four adults. The electric steering handles like nothing else on rain soaked gravel roads, no pulling or floating to the side.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We like VENZA a lot and bought one and we like the drive. But the sales guy forced us to buy a flip-down DVD player that too 10.2 Inch screen size to give us $100 off. Now when we flip down the DVD player it completely blocks the rear view mirror causing huge safety concern, Also If cops notice that you may be liable for penalty as well. On top of the safety issue they plugged a wireless-audio DVD player which signals to the existing radio... that's disgusting... you always hear static and the volume is bad. If sales person had given an option of rear-seat two screen DVD player as an option we would have gone for this... that sales guy was not trained to give out options to the customer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We did a lot of research on the Venza before buying it. The Pros far out weigh the Cons. We have owned a Ford Edge, which drives like a truck. The Venza drives like a luxury car. We drove both the 4 cyl and the 6 cyl Venza. The 6 cyl has better performance and had a better response time. The engine on the 6 cy is a lot quieter than the 4 cyl.

<TEXT>I have been in my Venza for a month and I love it. It's beautiful and the ride is powerful and smooth. Interior appointments are easy to use and very classy. Interior has a lot of room in the front and in the back seat. Lots of storage room. Who needs an SUV. The Venza does it all. Toyota does it again. I had my Rav4 for 8 years and loved it. Now I've gone the next step up with the Venza.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Luv it!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I was interested in the Venza prior to its availability. The Venza does not disappoint. A Driver of mini vans for several years, I was looking for a change. The Venza is a sleek design with a good performance. It has a very roomy interior and convenient rear seats that folds down at the touch of a lever for plenty of cargo space. With all the bells and whistles, Nav, Blue tooth, JBL stereo, Dual pano roof, this car is not cheap @ $35K, but it is cheaper than a lot of others that are in its class.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All. The Venza feels solid. Responsive handling, corners well. Comfortable ride. Safety features with 7 air bags. Smart key is one of my favorite features. I don't have to fish in my purse for my keys.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My husband & I love our Venza. Roomy, great looking and drives beautifully. I don't understand all the negative comments about the wheel size, they look great on this car and fill the wheel wells nicely. The ride is comfortable even here in the northeast where the roads are the worst. I would also like to add that it's nice to be one of few to own one of these, you don't see yourself coming and going on the roads(I suppose once Toyota begins leasing them that'll all change). We're loving every single moment we cruise in this baby!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Well equipped, no complaints here.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Venza is very fun, comfortable and easy to drive. Long trips the Venza rides smooth. V6 has great pick up. Coming off a V8 Sequioa. The Venza gets lots of looks. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Nav, SAT, JBL sound system, sounds really good. I like the hatch back which helps out with loading and unloading. The easy to close back door with the push of a button on back door or key button. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Previously owned a 2005 Camry. Hard to give up 32 mpg, but fell in love with the root beer colored Venza. Have driven it 1000 miles now 50/50 Highway/City Avg Mpg is 27. The key is to keep the rpms below 2000 as much as possible.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Push button start. Can't lock keys inside. Panoramic roof. Plenty of room in front and rear. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my TRUSTWORTHY Ford Escape for this....and coughed up a good amount of cash. They asked for 34,000 Dollars, for a Toyota....but, this is with the V6 and highest Luxury trims....Well, it was not better build quality than by Ford Escape.....which was on 05. It drove like a Camry......boring, and looks horrible. Also, I noticed, it took much of its styling from the Ford Edge, which I would recommend over this vehicle. The car rattles on paved roads. Navigation is sluggish, like Windows XP, and the entire car is lackluster. Thank god for the high resale, I am getting a FORD!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mileage, resale value, decent power on the V6</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving large SUVs and minivans for the past 15 years, it was time to downsize. I still need a vehicle with plenty of cargo room because I do the purchasing for my husband's business, but was ready for something smaller, sportier (without compromising on luxury features), and big enough to comfortably seat our entire family of 5 when the 3 kids are home from college. The Venza has met all of my needs and has been a great car! I also considered Lexus and Acura crossovers (both were much more expensive, and the Venza had more features that I actually wanted) as well as the Highlander, but the superior second row seating and gas mileage of the Venza made it the clear choice for me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Keyless ignition and doors, mileage (with REGULAR gas instead of PREMIUM!!), interior comfort, iPod dock, bluetooth, best lumbar support of any vehicle that I considered, black carpet with beige interior (gives me the light interior I prefer with a carpet color that hides dirt and spills)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drove my new Toyota off the dealership in mid-January and have been loving my choice! Great acceleration-smooth driving on interstate-comfort all the way! I personally love the fact that there is no 3rd seat- after 4 mini-vans, I now feel like I'm driving a Lexus-for a lot less! It even looks similar to the Lexus-I love the low to the ground entry-exit-my Venza is fully loaded- the only negative is the fuel efficiency-but I love the fact that I have more room than the more fuel efficient Prius. It was worth the wait! I test drove Honda CR_V, Subaru Tribeca and the Nissan Murano.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>EVERYTHING! Heated leather seats, smart key, driver and passenger lumbar support, leg room in back for son-in-law, moon roof, handle release back seats, sound system, etc.</FAVORITE>
