<TEXT>In my family we own an 09 Rabbit and 08 Mazda 3. They are truly both fantastic cars. Both are equipped pretty much the same and they both cost the same (just about 17K). My wife drives the Mazda and she loves it however I am a good size guy and I find the Rabbit's seat goes back further and has more thigh support (and overall room). The Mazda gets better gas mileage but the Rabbit has better acceleration so in my opinion the lower MPG is a fair trade. Both handle extremely well and are a lot of fun to drive however the Rabbit is a little more quiet overall. The Mazda has one of the nicest stearing wheels I have ever seen on any car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very comfortable seats and driving position. Excellent automatic transmission. Excellent handling. Every car should have heated seats! Everyone should have a small hatchback. So versatile!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Quick, even at a 6500ft Colorado altitude. Precise handling. Precise- shifting 5-speed gearbox. Typical excellent German craftsmanship -- inside and outside -- with obvious attention to detail. Roomy. Lots of features that are "package upgrages" on other brands. Airbags everywhere, traction/stability management, and other safety features. Good MPGs for the HP/torque. On top of all that, driving-thrill-for-the-investment can't be beaten.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent acceleration. Quality build. Roomy, yet with a small exterior. Hatchback. Blue & red gauge lights. Red LEDs in the ceiling for soft lighting of the cabin at night. Chilled glove- box. Thick, easy-to-grip steering wheel. Momentary movement of the turn signal activates the blinker 3 flashes.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Car has seen all types of driving and has fared extremely well. The engine in the car is well suited to most driving situations and the abundance of power and torque plus an engine that enjoys revving provides an acceleration not found in competitors, the five speed manual has short throws and positive feel with good clutch feedback. Suspension is based on the sportier GTI, giving the Rabbit surefooted dynamics while providing a comfortable ride even over harsh roads, the standard ESP provides an added safety net. No problems while owning the vehicle, and fuel economy has averaged approximately 28 miles per gallon, while full tanks on the freeway can net up to 33 miles per gallon. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, transmission, suspension combination. Stereo system with 10 speakers. Standard ESP. Key fob can open or close windows. Sunroof. Blue and red gauge cluster lights. Controls are intuitive and well laid out. One touch window controls.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love driving this car, It's really quiet, smooth and pretty quick. Plus this car handles really well. Best of all is the gas mileage. I get about 26mpg all city traffic, and about 29-30 with mixed city/highway driving. The sticker estimated mpg is way low at 21/28.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well built with more than expected standard features. Excellent performance and safety features. Interior of car feels like a much larger car. Average mileage has been 27 mpg in all around driving. Very quiet interior and smooth 6 spd tiptronic auto trans. I am extremely happy after 2 months with this gem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When it was time to trade in my old car (a '95), I looked at nearly all of the cars in the $15-20K market. Drove the Mazda3, Vibe, Versa, Matrix, Civic, xD... they all kind of felt the same. I had resigned myself to a functional compact with few features that I could "make do" with; then I drove the Rabbit. WHOA - it was like finding religion. There is absolutely no car in this class that is nearly as fun to drive. Plus even the base model is packed with extras. The interior is refined with quality materials. I got the 2-door 5-speed manual and I love it. I've never owned a VW before, but the Rabbit has definitely made me a believer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Solid build quality, great handling, peppy 2.5L engine, lots of room (I'm a big guy), red LEDs light the interior at night, easy-to-read gauges, hidden iPod dock, heated seats, adjustable center armrest, rear wiper, chilled glove compartment, defrost for side-view mirrors and back window</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased a 2009 VW Rabbit, after looking at other cars in its class, including the Mitsubish Lancer GTS, Mazda 3, and Subaru Impreza. While I think I could have been happy with any of the other cars mentioned, I truly love my Rabbit. I could not justify the additional price of the GTI for a few fractions of a second faster from 0-60 mph, and the added costs for premium fuel and insurance. The Rabbit will satisfy all but the most power hungry. Fuel economy is mediocre, but a fair trade off for power and performance. The Rabbit has the best build quality, not just in intelligent design, but in the material used. It does not feel like a sub $20,000 car, nor does it drive like one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Perfectly sized steering wheel and fairly intuitive controls. Excellent gear shift lever. I love the way the gear selector "snickity-snicks" into place with precision with moderately short throws. There's a lot of nice touches like the Gorilla Mat for the trunk, fasteners and the full sized spare!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking for a little hatchback. I picked the Rabbit over the Mazda 3 and Imprezza because it was more fun driving, cost less, and is supposed to get a little better mileage. It also got great CR ratings. I've had four people in it a few times and there seems to be enough room. The car reminds me of the civic hatchbacks from the early 90s. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is pretty maneuverable and responsive like you expect from a little car, but it is really smooth on the highway.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This bunny is a fun and comfortable ride even at German autobahn speeds (+100mph). The bunny is just as roomy as my '03 Passat and easier to park in Europe's tight parking garages. I had one rough start on a chilly morning (+5F), maybe that Knock sensor acting up, don't know for sure because it cleared itself up in a few seconds. I was soaked getting in once by water pooled on the roof, run-off made it too my arm and leg before I could close the door. Need to be mindful of passenger side rear blind spot. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats! Fantastic headlights. Intermittent rear wiper. Tiptronic. Jumping Rabbit insignia. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have driven 10,000 kms since Sep 2008 and I generally find my Rabbit fun to drive. On 4 separate occasions though I have had the experience of putting my foot on the accelerator and got ZERO response. Fortunately, to date, this has only occurred from idle (ie car was stationary). Having read your review I will take it to the dealership again and ask them to check the Knock Sensor. Thanks</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Rabbit is a very enjoyable car to drive. I've put 8000+ miles on it so far and find it both comfortable and fun. The torque supplied in the low range is a great change from most newer cars that save the power to above 5000rpms. My wife and I fight over driving this car daily, rather than the SUV we have.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The loads of standard features (sat radio, seat warmers, etc) and the excellent engine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just got my 2009 Rabbit 3 weeks ago and I mostly love it. It has a cozy feel, the dash is easy to use, the lights are distinct and easy to read, and it handles nicely, even in snow (which we've had about every day since I got it). It has a jaunty overall feel and I am quite pleased overall. The sales staff was also really informed and helpful.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats are divine, a/c in glove box will likely be a favorite in summer. I find the space ample and the seats comfortable. I like the defrosting rear view mirrors.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The best way to describe the Rabbit is: solid. The steering and braking are nicely weighted; the doors and hatch make a nice "thunk" when closed; acceleration is smooth and strong. Spacious for a compact car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration, sunroof, Sirius (I was surprised how much I liked this), great feel when driving. Also...how did I ever live without a hatch?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I went from a 4 door Tacoma to the rabbit. Never again will I buy a truck. Fits my 6,3 self, wife, and newborn perfectly. Awesome display, speakers, ride is sooo quite and smooth. All these complaints on the mph, I have had no such issues. Nor have I had any issues with blind spots. A blast to drive slow or fast. Aux hook up for the ipod is always a plus, satellite radio is an option on some. Auto door locks after 30 seconds is a great for safety.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2006 Rabbit for a short time (it was totaled in an accident), which influenced my decision to buy my 2009 Rabbit recently. The Rabbit feels like a solid, well-built car. It's a fun car to drive, with its 170 horsepower and the 6-speed Tiptronic transmission. The controls are easy to use, and the layout is logical. The seats are comfortable, and the interior is roomy. I like the overall look of the Rabbit, inside and out. I like the features, too. The stereo sounds great and is easy to use. Standard Electronic Stability Program is a nice touch. The engine is smooth and seems quieter than my 2006 Rabbit. Fuel economy could be better. iPod operation is buggy and not intuitive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just went from an 07 Corolla to the 09 Rabbit. Couldn't be happier. Great performing and sounding engine, nice handling with perfect body roll, extremely solid feel on the highway, fun to drive, roomy, excellent safety features, decent (but not great) stereo, nice transmission, and generally good looks make it a winner. The Corolla is a good, but very pedestrian car. The Rabbit literally blows it away in the "fun to drive" category and comes with all the standard safety features that make the difference. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love driving this car. I went from a pickup truck to the Rabbit. I didn't realize what a dog my truck was until driving the Rabbit every day. It's quick, shifts great, handles tight, fast lane changes are easy and smooth. I wanted a Mini Cooper S and the Rabbit gives me that sporty agile ride. I would not trade hp for better mileage. The engine is Great. Took a road trip on Thanksgiving and enjoyed the car. The cruise controls and audio controls were very intuitive and after a couple hundred miles I didn't miss them not being in the steering wheel. Its a very nice wheel so don't not buy the car just because the controls are not in it. You will forget about it quickly enough!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>New to me the bump turn signal and you get 3 blinks, fabulous all cars should have it. The windows one click up & down is nice. Love the hatch opening handle, don't know why some dis it because it's one finger lift and it looks cool. Steering wheel is sweet. Vents under the seats are nice. 4whdiscb</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2001 Outback and was afraid the Rabbit would feel so much smaller-- it's not at all. The mpg is better than the Outback, even with 1 more cylinder. I was expecting entry level features and was surprised by the thought that was put into the design. I drive out to the mountains a lot and am pleasantly surprised at how my bunny scampers up a steep grade. I had a Rabbit diesel in the 80s and am so glad I thought to try a Rabbit again. I couldn't be more pleased. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This bunny hops! The Rabbit is so much fun to drive. I hadn't driven a stick shift in 11 years, but am having a ball driving this car. Even though it's a small car, it feels big inside. My golden retriever can sleep in the back without laying the back seat down. I LOVE this car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Excellent car that handles extremely well on the road. Negotiates curves like a charm. I got this after wrecking my 07 Mazda 3 (through no fault of my own). The Mazda was a good car, but this one blows it out of the water. The Rabbit offers a smoother ride, a tighter turn radius, and generally a better grip on the road. Also, the Mazda is more expensive if you add all the features that is standard in the Rabbit. Its worth mentioning that because of this car's higher safety rating, my insurance went down significantly. From the outside, the car looks simple, but in my opinion that simplicity gives it a more distinguished look. The laser welded body is a big plus. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>-German design and build quality. -170 horses - turn radius - handling - full spare tire - ample room in the front (I drive alone 85% of the time. Definitely not a family car). - Standard ESP - standard safety features (a big plus since I got into the aforementioned car wreck).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My White little Rabbit dominates the small car genre easily in Sport. Test driving other small American and Japanese cars felt like a waste of time after riding in VW's 09 Rabbit. The Focus is hard to focus on after you are behind the wheel of a fully powered Rabbit.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great little car, it feels very solid compared to other small cars in class. Independent suspension, great 6 speed transmission, 5 cylinder engine, add up to a lot of value for about 18K. Uncluttered instrument panel. Drivers seat great for taller drivers. Gets up and goes when it needs to.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very comfortable ride. Problem with most small cars I've had in past is that on long trips, road noise, low car weight, and underpowered engines kept me at home. This 09 does very well on the interstate and as quiet as my E series Benz.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted a small sedan. One test drive of Civic and Corolla and they were out. Those sheep need to look around a little. Mazda3 is a good car and better value, but this one just "felt" like it was built better. I picked the Rabbit over the Jetta because of the chrome on the front and the fake leather seats, I just couldn't do it. The real stuff is better, why bother? Also Rabbits are unusual around here. I've enjoyed the car so far. It really IS fun to drive. Plenty of power. NO exterior "loud & obnoxious" things about it. A real knock out in red. I can't believe this car is not more popular. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Horsepower, ride quality, low road & wind noise, quality of interior materials, exterior and interior looks - simple and elegant, feels like an older BMW, the little "Easter eggs" you find and appreciate, ALL of the safety stuff you could want</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Very nice! I love my 2009 Rabbit. Its fun, it's swift and surprisingly roomy. It fits 2 adults in the back quite nicely. I don't know who the previous reviewer was trying to fit in his 2 door! I have had 3 girlfriends squeeze in the back! I wanted all the standard safety features. Mazda 3 does not offer ESP standard. Even after reading all the bad reviews of the previous models with electronic breakdowns, i still got the Bunny and I love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is an amazing car to get. I paid 17,325 and got a lot of excellent features. This car feels good to drive in, and when your already tired from driving, the car wont get you more tired. 10 speaker German sound, will wake you up. For a 2009, this is more likely the best car to get. Gas is the issue, but for the performance and comfort, it's well worth it. I am a mechanic and it seems to that this car is excellent for every day driver. Engine temp stays at 190*f and even on 12 hour drives it does. Highest mpg was 28 so far. This car has the same concept of the VW golf. But way better</TEXT>

<TEXT>The handling is still a little unresponsive, but VW definitely put some thought into this car. Fuel mileage is a little bad but coming from 20/27 I'm good. There are little easter eggs in this car that a good run-through should show. Stereo system could be improved, as it sounds like I'm listening through two old computer speakers, but who buys the base and expects premium sound? Radio reception and sound are much better than I expected. The back seat is big enough to fit maybe one person comfortably, but don't through two adults back there. Also you don't even notice the lack of arm rest if you decide to opt out of the iPod dock. But that's more a personal preference. All in all, get it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Unique features that are hidden in the car; the black cloth interior is really nice; makes me feel like I'm driving a sports car. Oh and the PONIES. This thing has some nice kick for a small car, so don't underestimate it when you tail behind in traffic. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I do a lot of serious driving, and over the years I have found that I need a car that will act like a car and perform like a car, when I demand from it. The Rabbit does just that. You're not bulking around a huge vehicle, and so you are able to zip in and out of the rest of the traffic. The 5 cylinder engine with its 170 hp is plenty powerful enough and the car has a whole lot of get-up-and-go. I got the 5 speed manual version of the Rabbit, because, let's face it, it's the only way to truly drive a VW. You're in command at all times. The air conditioning is great, and it has an excellent 10 speaker quality stereo system, with ipod connect and in-dash CD changer. You need this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I believe the Rabbit is the best buy for the buck. My wife has an A-4 3.2 and this is like a cousin. The German feel. Great acceleration and just simply fun to drive. The Corolla and Civic appear very refined but are just mini town cars. Compare and you have the most features for your dollar. ESP standard in 09. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great driving experience. I have never owned a small car and am impressed. If I had it to do over I would buy it again and again.</FAVORITE>
