<TEXT>This is a dream car,The price is extremely low for a great performing automobile. My only complaint is lack of radio.I think this is a game to increase price.I ordered a Sony CD radio for a total price 151.24. Will pay 40-50 installation. Versa comes prewired except a radio. Ebay tell me of 200.00 saving over Nissan's radios.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very large interior.Seats are extremely comfortable. terrific ride and handling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My Ford Taurus died on me and I was shopping around for a midsized sedan with good gas mileage. I researched and test drove a Versa, Corolla, Elantra, and Spectra. Although I could get in an Elantra and Spectra for a bit cheaper, I went with the Versa because we liked it so much after test drive. Much better leg room in the rear (compared to the other cars) and a very comfy ride. The Versa handles very well, is fun to drive, and looks quite sporty (mine is red). We really like the extra features of the SL model (since we have 2 small boys). So far, I've gotten excellent MPG. I also qualified for a "green" loan from my Credit Union, due to the combined MPG of the Versa being over 29 MPG.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth-quiet ride, comfortable seats, great MPG, roomy (doesn't feel like you're in a smaller car), great trunk space, sporty...etc.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my versa for the most part for the price and also the room. I am 6'3" tall, and it is difficult to find a comfortable small car. The Versa fits the bill. We liked the Versa so much that three months later we purchased another, this time the HB. Love them both. If you have the extra money- spring for the power option, my 1.6 has only A/C and it is very inconvenient to have no power locks or windows, although a small price to pay, for such a solid built, fuel efficient, comfortable car at that price. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my old 1995 Nissan 4X4 king cab for the 2009 Versa 1.6 L sedan with ABS and AC (cash for clunkers) The Versa is very comfortable, quiet, and very peppy on the road. Happy to have the AC and the ABS, no radio though. I got 400 miles on the 13.2 gallon fuel tank, not too shabby and that is with the AC on and in a lot of stop and go traffic. Looked at the Yaris but it was more expensive and not as comfortable or quiet and considerably less roomy. The Honda Fit was also less comfortable and less roomy plus more expensive. The Versa may not be flashy looking but it covers all the bases and then some. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have to admit, I cried when my husband traded in our 02 VW Beetle for this car. This is my first Nissan and I am VERY impressed by the quality of this car. The ride is smooth and quiet, plenty of head and leg room for everyone to fit comfortably, and amenities galore you would not expect to find on such a well priced car ($18,400)! We have close to 8K miles on our SL Versa. The gas mileage went from OK (27 mpg) to GREAT (32) as it becomes more broken in. We have every option imaginable, sunroof, bluetooth, remote keyless entry/ignition, cruise, CVT, stero upgrade with AUX port, steering controls, power everything, sporty body kit upgrade and no problem with any of it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the gadgety options that are available on this entry level car. GAS MILEAGE! Overall price. Comfort of the seats. The height of the vehicle almost makes it feel like a crossover and makes it easy to get in and out of. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Brand new 2009 Nissan Versa 1.6L / 5spd Sedan. Miles per gallons is underrated. With a combination of freeway and city street driving we are getting over 40 miles per gallon as an average. 400+miles with only 10 gallons of gas! So on the highway the mileage is probably well over 40mpg. This 1.6L sips gas even with the A/C on. Not only that but this 1.6L engine accelerates pretty well for it's size. Is surprisingly roomy for it's size as well. Fits 4 adults comfortably. Handles well, very much like a VW Golf or similar. Quiet engine and quiet ride. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>40+MPG Comfortable to driver or ride even for a large male. Good quality for it's price range. Quiet engine and quiet ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got the Versa Sedan 1.6 with 5 speed manual transmission and A/C with ABS through the "Cash for Clunkers" program. I wanted the least expensive car out there that had A/C and that an adult could fit into. I've owned Nissan's before and I know they make a better product. This car is made for practical adults. It has plenty of safety features and a lot of interior room. The truck is very roomy for vacation travel. For the kid in me, I do enjoy winding it up and going through the gears. It isn't a speed demon but I can get through traffic with ease if I'm running late.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I purchased the Versa in August 09 in South Carolina. The temps are in the high 80's to low 90's. The A/C works well and keeps the car cool, if not just plan cold. Even with the A/C running all the time at full blast, the car got 29 MPG on the first tank of gas in city driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My Wife and I bought a Nissan as our first car in 1983. It was a Stanza and was a horrible car. We never considered Nissan again until I found this Nissan Versa. I wanted a fun car for errands and commuting and the Fit and Yaris were too small. We looked at used cars but found that a new 2009 Versa was actually a better deal than a used car. I love the way it rides, it holds my carpoolers well, the standard radio/CD player is great, it is peppy and holds plenty of groceries in the hatch. While in this car I am 57 years young, taking me back to my college days. My Wife wanted black and frankly speaking it looks as expensive as an Audi or similar small expensive car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am absolutely in love with my Versa. Previously drove another Nissan and so was interested in buying another one. As a first time buyer did a lot of research on cars and found this to be the best. Initially I wasn't interested in a hatchback but this has more of a sporty look and that old timey station wagon feel. Comfortable car, features great, and good for road trips. As a recent graduate, the price was extremely affordable. I would pick this car again and again if I had to do it over. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am seventeen years old and this car was given to me as a gift from my father. I use it to drive to school and to my friends houses everyday. I find its comfortable and all my friends like that the interior is quite spacious. I drive this car allot, and have found that while it is great to drive alone, as soon as the car fills up with over four people, the performance begins to decrease extensively with the added weight to the point where driving becomes a big challenge. This car has two main flaws. One is the clunky gearbox which makes shifting into gear an uncomfortable chore, and the other is the pathetic braking ability. Stopping distances are dangerously long without ABS.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ok, so I've only had it a week, but it's been a great week. I drove everything before deciding on the Versa - it was the best equipped for the $, and has a solid feel, not like that "tin can little car" feel you'd expect. If you're buying, spring for the SL with CVT - great mpg, and surprising zip factor. Got 29mpg on first tank. Also surprising - the roominess in the cabin. No cramped legs, no bumped heads. LOTS of storage. Parking is a breeze. Great price, great incentives, great warranty. I drive a LOT, and am very happy and expecting only to grow happier with my choice. Getting lots of compliments too...from "cool car!" to "adorable!" to "wow!" ... this is my second Nissan, won't be last!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been looking at autos of this style for the past month. I've tested the Toyota Yaris, Chevy Aveo, Honda Fit, Kia Rio5, and the Hundai Elantra Touring. Some of them were a bit sportier in style and performance but mostly less than the Nissan. Roominess was and is a hands down to the Nissan. I absolutely despised the instrument layout in the Toyota I guess that I don't like having to look over for the speedo etc.. Price was also a factor with the Nissan hitting the right tone. For those who haven't driven the Chevy Aveo be cautioned, if you have to make a left turn and even see oncoming traffic you will be better off to get out and push than to use the accelerator. So far very Happy!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort level of the Versa is far beyond my expectations, I'm 6'2" @ 210 and have no problem sitting in any seat in this car! I even have to come a bit forward from the stops in the driver's seat! Controls easily reached and well laid out. Fantastic Visibility! Elbow Room! Mileage so far averages 29</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We already have a car payment, so we decided to get just the basic Versa with only air condition and auto transmission add-ons. When it comes to Nissan's 'basic', be careful because there are a few things we didn't notice until after buying the car. No way to adjust the side mirrors from inside, no clock and the thing that we were most disappointed about is, there is no key hole on the passenger side. You can't unlock the door from the passenger side! What if someone parked so close to your driver's door that you couldn't get in? Well, then your out of luck because there's no other way to get in the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am at 9000 miles at just 6 months. so you know I am driving this car. I drive 42 miles round trip to work and take trips when I can. I love this car. It is 90 degrees now and I am comfortable with the air. I have only driven it on setting three once or twice. I usually drive with it on the first setting after letting the hot air out. I have moved an office in it so I know it has plenty of space. It is very comfortable for anyone sitting in the back. I drove 211 miles at 85 miles without stopping and got good gas mileage and made really great time. This will get you where you want to go. It might not be the fanciest car out there but for the price. It is hard to beat. Artic Blue my fav!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I am the person that you have to move over for in the left lane. I love to drive a minimum of 80 hr on the hwy. I know way too fast. BUT this car does it. It out manuevers anything on the road. (I drive in Atlanta) I love this car. Interior is really comfortable and really easy to keep clean.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After looking at the Versa Basic (Base+A/C) with Auto trans and ABS and nothing else (not even a radio) with MSRP of $12,965, my wife and I decided to purchase the $15,8xx 'S' model because it included a very nice $1,250 rebate AND had a higher markup between invoice and MSRP which allowed us to get a better deal. We wound up spending $1200 to get the upgraded interior, the upgraded engine, power locks/windows/doors, keyless entry, stereo, floor mats, cruise control,and alloy wheels. Basically $3000+ worth of features for $1,200. We love the car and wound up paying $14,200 at carmax. With the CARS program we got $4,650 for our 1985 dodge and the Versa S only cost us $9,550.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>No safety marks less than 4 out of 5 stars. Great visibility (sits as high as some crossover models). Value - find another SAFE car with Nissan's reputation for reliability that is fully-loaded with options for $14,200 after rebates - you can't do it. Best interior room of any model in it's class.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my 2009 Nissan Versa SL in May 09 to replace 07 Santa Fe truck. I was looking for a more fuel economy car. The car has about 1600 miles now. I notice the the steering wheel pulsates as you brake and come to a complete stop, don't know if there something wrong with the ABS. I also have a problem starting the car with long crank or multiple crank. I have an appointment for this weekend so hopefully they can address these two issues. MGP not as good as advertise or other people are getting here. It could be due to the fuel pressure regulator.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The blu tooth, keyless entry to all doors, not key need to start the car and aux input in the radio. It allows me to plug in my MP3 which supports HD radio. Like all these features which I don't even have on my 06 Acura TL. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have just had the S Hatchback for a week and just filled up yesterday. 250 city miles on initial tank. Now, I am OCDing about not getting the SL because I am regretting not having the CVT for the many hills on my daily commute. I drove Hondas for 22 years, lastly a 1995 Odyssey until 180,000 miles. I guess I miss the heaviness of that van and the fact that it seemed to downshift on hills requiring less braking. This Versa S if fine except when going down winding hills until I get used to the difference. Any suggestions? I am trying to shift into 2nd gear upon descent and that helps decrease the need to brake as much. Will I get over not having the CVT? Everyone loves the roominess.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the 1.6 base model. My out of pocket was 5400 dollars + Tax after the cash for clunkers deal. It is nice not to have a loan to worry about and have a 3 year warranty. That is my biggest rave about this car. I drive about 2 miles to work and back as well as running errands around town. So far this car is doing what I expect it to do. It handles well in the city, has good pick up. It is very utilitarian which is exactly what I wanted. Great commuter car (so far) I am looking for a very low total cost of ownership. Basically I drove my last car for free and I hope I can do the same for this one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The cabin room is great! I am six foot five and two hundred fifty pounds and this car comfortably fits me and would a couple of other adults easy. Getting out of the car is surprisingly easy, it sits quite high off the ground. I also like the large trunk space. It is also rated as safe to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this yesterday with my Clunker's trade-in incentive of $4500. It also carries a manufacturer rebate of $1750 for SL, totaling a saving of $6250! Its' hard to beat that. In order to maximize my Clunker's incentive, I needed a car that has 28 mpg or better. It's hard to find one without going hybrids which can easily cost over 20K. This one fits my bill perfectly. Actually not all Versa have 28 mpg or better, just the 1.6 engine or the 1.8 engine with CVT. Unfortunately, with such saving programs in place, the whole dealership was jammed with customers. I had to buy the car in pretty much MSRP price and with extras loaded. So far, the car is fun to drive and handles well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first "new" car. I have always bought older custom datsuns and other sports cars so my review may be different. I bought a 09 versa base for the rain and winter, but wound up putting custom rims and a few other goodies on it. Being nissans official rally racing car you can feel the agility. Great performance for 9990. I know, I drive fast cars. I didnt expect this versa to handle this well out of the box. It has the usual chinsey plastic inside for a low cost Nissan but otherwise great car. Amazing room. Fun to drive. Great on gas. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the Versa for about 4 months; I would not buy another one. This car has been back to the dealer several times to fix small problems. It has several flaws that are important to me. One the AC is undersized for Florida, when out in the heat you need to put the air flow to recycle to keep the cabin cool. Although the noise level when running is the lowest of the other cars I test drove; it is the loudest car I ever be in when you accelerate. Last but not least. The driver?s side window wiper is about twice the size of the passenger side, and it throws its water on to the passenger side. Thus in the rain the passenger side is never clear. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My '09 Versa 1.8S HB (6-speed stick) is almost a year old and I am quite happy with it. I've had oil changes and the whole car checked over every 3750 miles per Nissan's advice. MPG isn't what I'd hoped (my former car, a Dodge Neon with a larger engine and an automatic got 30 mpg), I am getting mid-twenties in town and low thirties on the highway. Which isn't bad anyway, right? I put new custom rims on (black), other than that the car is stock. I am waiting on a part from Nissan to fix the plastic shroud around the battery which inexplicably tore loose somehow. I have had no mechanical issues such as some of those reported here. Once the tach hits 3000 rpm watch out, the car takes off!</TEXT>

Very good visibility, this and crash rating were seller for me. Paid 13500 out the door including tags and taxes . Also included dealer installed cruise control. Only negative is that 1st gear is sometimes hard to find.Have driven sticks for last 20+ years and have never had this problem before. Wife feels gearing is too short between gears as well.

<TEXT>I purchase this car new in Oct of '08 as a '09 model. A week after I bought the car, the car started to have a long crank. There were times that it would not start on the first try. I took it to the dealer and they replaced the 'Fuel Pressure Regulator'. Now the car has 22500 miles. I do drive far for work. So far everything has been alright. I am averaging 31MPG on this car. It starting to have the 'long crank problem' again for the third time. I will be taking my car in for the third time for the same issue. This is getting annoying. Good car but i would not buy another Versa. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just love my versa. What a fun car to drive. Averaging 26mpg - less than advertised 40mpg - but still am satisfied. Very comfortable, even on long trips. Ample room in the trunk area - and I'm always loading it up with Costco bulk purchases! Two repair problems so far and I'm still under 2000 miles. Driver door lock would not unlock manually, and I needed a new fuel pump after experiencing difficulty starting the vehicle. I've read on a number of forums that this is a problem for many, however Nissan has not issued a recall, just a service bulletin. Despite this, I just love the car and would recommend it to anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2009 Nissan Versa SL about 6 months ago. About a month after purchase, the AC starting making loud rattling noises. Brought it to the dealership to be fixed with no success. Had to argue with the dealer just to get them to even look at the car again, and 2 months later and after 2 more drop-offs that problem appears to be solved by replacing the entire AC system. A few weeks after this incident, the car starts having trouble turning over. The dealer replaces the Fuel Pump Regulator, which solves the problem for about 6 weeks. Today, the car is back in the shop with the same issue again. Already considering getting rid of it, despite the loss I would take. NOT RECOMMENDED.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove the honda fit and the scion xd, and I chose the versa mainly because of the roomy interior and the price. Definitely worth the upgrade to the SL, the S and base versions don't have as nice interior (armrest,upholstery, ipod). This car is perfect for my commute and it's fun to zip around the city in. It's comfortable to drive and isn't goofy looking like the scion or the fit. It gets good gas mileage, handles well, and drives fine on the freeway and in the city. I've read reviews where they say it's a snooze to drive, but I disagree. It's got the ipod jack and cruise control, and it feels like you are in a much larger car. My family and friends can all ride comfortably in it! </TEXT>

<TEXT> Did tons of research on compacts out today. All have pro's and con's. Most important in the end was safety ratings then price. The Versa fit my bill the best and is a really nice ride for the money. Unfortunately the car only came with automatic tranny, AC and floormats as options, but dealer hooked me up with splash guards. As for the lack of radio I just went on ebay and got a factory versa radio for 50 buck. Car then was complete and I was totally happy. Interior is VERY roomy and comfortable. Power from engine is zippy, but can be very buzzy when acelerating hard. Seen 28 to 40 mpgs so car is great fuel saver. Automatic tranny is not the smoothest I've driven.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car last December. I have a blue 1.6 sedan, manual transmission; AC & ABS. That is all you need!!!...In this consumer oriented society, we have gotten used to wasting money...well I commute every day 37 miles each way...in city traffic. My Versa just turned 3K and my fuel average is 40 mpg!!! so on a cost per mile basis this is as good as it gets...sure I had to spend $200 bucks to install a nice CD & HD radio, but the car already came with 4 speakers and antenna pre-wired. So far the car has been absolutely trouble free...yes I have to exercise my arm just a bit to manually lower the window at drive thru's and garage gates...and I had to manually adjust my side view mirror</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>when I first picked the car up...big deal...oh yes...one thing is that I have to remember to manually lock each door when getting out of the car...again these are minor things...and if you are willing to live with them...you can get yourself a nice, reliable car for less than a regularly used one.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Versa yesterday, so cannot speak on its reliability and build yet. I drove both the S and SL versa hatch. The S was a smooth, quiet ride with lots of room, power and comfort. No trouble getting up hills and good acceleration. The SL improved with the CVT and extra options, but the S would have done the job fine. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The CVT is a gas saver and should cut maintenance costs. The seats are plush and the driver's adjusts for height. Bluetooth and intellikey are handy. It does not feel like an entry-level subcompact but a luxury midsize car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Driving a 2000 Sable last summer when gasoline hit $4/gallon made me swear to replace it with a fuel-efficient car when it died. Now I am two weeks into owning this car and can report that the MPG is wondrous, I drove nearly 400 miles on the first tank of gas. The 5- speed stick makes for a ton of fun although the car gets noticeably buzzy above 70 mph and 5th doesn't feel like it should be the last upshift. This is not a problem around town where the car zips around like Yorkshire terrier hunting for mice, but I can't say I'm looking forward to interstate driving at high speed with this car. But what most owners say is true: This car feels a lot larger than it is.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The six air bags, standard in all Versas, coupled with the $250 optional ABS package makes me feel very safe. The four factory speakers sound better than I had anticipated. And while the car is stripped to basics, there is still a tire pressure monitoring system. Go figure.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this car for about six months and I'm already tired of it. I previously owned an 06 Hyundai Sonata that I adored until I totaled it. The Versa gets great gas mileage, and I trust the Nissan name. However, it has depreciated $6000 already! I expected a small, foreign-made car to retain its value today but I was sadly mistaken! I have cruise control and ABS options. I'm mostly disappointed at the high price I'll be paying off for several years for a tiny, basic car. It is absolutely frightening to drive this car in the snow/ice or even high-wind (I was actually blown off the road once). There is poor get-up (when compared to my Sonata) and poor storage up front (lacks a console).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage. Cute appearance. Comfy seats. I am often impressed at how much I can store in the back of my car. However, I wish the back seats could be completely folded up (they only fold down on top). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife loves the fact that when she drives around in her Versa, everyone looks at her and smiles. It's not a common car around here, but she picked it out because she thought it was the cutest. Inside it feels like a larger car. We got a sunroof (the only car in its class that had one as an option) and like the way it handles. CVT is smooth with lots of power and pep! With only 500 miles on the engine, got 32 MPG on highway, 27 MPG on Vermont back roads.</TEXT>

<TEXT> I bought my Versa at the end of September, 2008. I love everything about it. I've had only one problem (a faulty gas cap causing the check engine light to come on) and I have only two things I could complain about. 1) I would like a lock that can be opened with the key on the hatch door, and 2) the heater/defroster seems to take longer to warm up than any other car I've owned. Item 1 could probably be solved by having power locks, but I didn't want them so I have to unlock the driver's door to unlock the hatch. I also disagree with reviews complaining of a lack of performance. I can't keep this car at the speed limit! I have a manual transmission, so that may the difference. Buy one these!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2009 Nissan 1.8 SL Hatchback was not even in my radar when I started doing my research for a new car. 48 hours after test driving one, though, I ordered it with all the available packages. This car is very fun to drive and has enough zip to not disappoint. CVT makes the ride so much smoother and quieter than the 2009 Honda Fit (I test drove both cars back to back on the same day). Edmunds.com may think it's a plain car, but I love it. Nothing complicated; just sound Nissan engineering.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Versa is a Renault design. Going all the way back to the Renault Dauphine, they are the only small cars I have ever seen with no front wheel well incursion into the passenger cabin. Not only can a tall driver stretch out, you also have lots of leg room side to side. It feels as comfortable and spacious as a Cadillac, to me. As I often rent cars to tour Europe, I am accustomed to the style and it is not goofy, to me. It is actually something distinctive. As the French invented front drive and have been making quality small cars for 50 years, I was ready for some Franco style and design in a Nissan package!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first new car, it has been driven for a year and I am considering trading it in. For a buyer that was supposedly making an upgrade from a 295,000 mile 1991 Toyota Previa I am truly disappointed. The car has been in the shop for major repairs like a malfunctioning A/C condenser, and braking problems. I never had such problems with my Previa. The engine knocks pretty loud in the mornings too. Needless to say, this was one of the worst cars I've bought, and I cant get rid of it because the resale value on the Nissan Versa and Nissan Sentra drop like a stone once you drive them off the lot</TEXT>

<TEXT>I think it looks fantastic. I like the faceted look at the edges of the trunk and hood. Anyway, form should follow function, and this car is very functional - it has more back seat leg room than many much larger and more expensive cars. It also has one of the largest trunks (sedan) in it's class. I think it's great fun to drive. If you want the best combination of low price, good gas mileage, large interior and trunk room, I think the Versa 1.6 wins hands down. Just put in a radio/CD and go, it already has 4 spkrs.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a cute car but I do not understand why Nissan does not make the aux port on the radio (for mp3 players) standard on all vehicles, especially the Versa which is priced for the younger crowd. The standard radio has a six CD changer, but who listens to CDs anymore? Seriously. Also, there is no armrest in the center for the right arm, which is mildly annoying, and there are no map lights which is pretty dumb. I'm not looking for luxury, but it would be nice if Nissan would be ahead of the curve on the cultural zeitgeist. Other vehicles in this category come with the aux port standard. When I asked how to upgrade the radio they said I couldn't do it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For its price, this car is undeniably a great deal. The hatchback is sporty in appearance, the interior is incredibly spacious for its overall size and the interior is very well designed. While the car is considered a compact by class, it doesn't feel so while driving as its 1.8 L engine has plenty of power for the car, and the transmission has almost seamless smooth transitions. Overall, this car is perfect for people who want a sporty commute to work and great fuel efficiency.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seating is elevated so that a driver has a great view of the road, is comfortable, and feels like they are in a larger car.

<TEXT>The car is comfortable, peppy, and quiet. Fun to drive. Very easy to clutch and shift. The back seat is very roomy, more than you would expect. The pros rate it as just a blah, so-so car. But they always compare it to another one that is 2-4 thousand more. It seems they do not have to listen to their bank account telling them a little compromise is OK. About the only thing you have to get used to is that on the highway, doing 65-70 mph, even in 6th gear, the engine RPM are about 3K, so you always think you still have to upshift. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, I traded in my previous vehicle of 6 years, a 2002 Dodge Ram 1500. Do I really need to say more here? I've only owned the car less than a week but this car is terrific. It's exactly what I was looking for. I was between this and the Honda Fit. The view from the Fit's drivers seat felt like you were too far back-it just felt uncomfortable. Anyway, going from a vehicle with a mpg rating of 15/11 to 33/27 is certainly going to have an impact on my trips to the gas pump (or lack there of), not to mention how much less it will cost me per fill up. I'm very pleased with it's roominess, and the 1.8L CVT engine has more pep than most people will think. Spend the extra $$ for the SL if you can!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6 disc changer, and I can now finally play my iPod in the car without using an FM tuner! Bluetooth is excellent, love the intellikey.

<TEXT>After having owned a Toyota Echo and a Toyota Matrix I decided to give the Nissan Versa a try. So far I must say that initially I am impressed by the smoothness of the CVT and the get up and go of the 4 cyl eng. Overall the interior is nice but the front seat armrest is a total useless joke. It is not high enough or long enough to lay your arm on. Hope they fix that in upcoming models. Haven't it it long enough to evaluate the gas mileage but hopefully it will fulfill the commuter car requirements around town and the occasional out of town trip. Good little car for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I always avoided considering Nissans going back to the Datsun days (B210s). When I checked out the Fit, Yaris, and Accent in looking for a simple good mileage car, I almost ignored the Versa, being biased against Nissan. I did my homework on all the above cars and kept on coming back to the Versa as the best overall value. When the dealer finally had a 2009 s 6 spd available, I made the jump and after the first 1500 miles, am very glad I did. So far it's a great little car that's fun to drive. I tend to keep cars (last car 1995 Saab 9000 with 305,000 miles) and felt the engine would hold up better than the Fit or Yaris over 100,000 miles. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mileage! Consistent 34 mpg on the first 5 tanks, very roomy at all seats. Power package included cruise control which I couldn't get reasonably ($$) with the Fit, Yaris or Accent. Also I found out the "V" has a timing chain instead of a belt, which is is disaster if it breaks. I love the 6spd. </FAVORITE>

There is plenty of head leg and shoulder room for me and with the driver seat in the furthest position to the rear a normal sized adults legs do not touch the back of my seat.

Much more roomy and comfortable seats than the other two. Smooth quiet acceleration without engine laboring. Surprisingly nice handling and tight turn radius. My previous car was a Pontiac GTO (great sportscar, gas hog, no trunk) and while the versa is no sports car, it's fun to drive and saves $$ on gas. The seats are spacious, comfortable and there is more than ample head and leg room. Seats do fold down but not flush in the back. Plenty of cup holders and power plugs.

With the trend in cars that are on the road going to cars designed like the Versa, Honda Fit, and Toyota Yaris, the Versa is a winner. The design I feel is more classy than it is modern or trendy. The tapered design is nice and economic and it most certainly is a comfortable ride. The space is a major plus, I never thought a small car would have this much room.</TEXT>

Instrumentation is well designed and readable, however, like every Nissan I've owned (Pathfinder, XTerra, and Titan) light and visibility in bright daylight is not on a par with the rest of the interior design. Although readable, it is only just. Fabric on seats with SL option is great - very comfortable and appears to be durable. Bluetooth was a total surprise. I never thought I would use it.
