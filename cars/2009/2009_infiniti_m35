<TEXT>I have been a Lexus customer for 12 years. We shopped around and found the M35X. They pushed their technology so much at the dealership we felt it had to be as good as Lexus if not better. Boy were we wrong. Unfortunately I now have 38 months of this nightmare left. I returned an 06 Lexus GS, which my phone the Palm Pre had no trouble pairing with the Bluetooth. My 09 M35X does not work at all with these phones. Static all the time and that supposedly great Bose radio that lowers and loudens itself at will comes on and off during a conversation. Then there is the nav - what a waste of money. No points of interest. Been lost a lot lately. $53000 really Infiniti. Entire system was replaced by dealer, no luck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car itself is beautiful and has a really nice ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just traded a 2006 M45, which I loved, for this car. I got the M35 to save a few bucks and get better gas mileage. The M35 with the 7 speed is almost as quick as the M45. The car rides great and is fun to drive, I got the Tech and Advanced Tech with Sport Packages. Love the DVD player, new 7 speed transmission with sport mode, hard disk music box, IPOD hook up, navigation and touch screen. All but the DVD and navigation are new features my 2006 did not have. I got the Blue Slate with black interior and it looks great!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car is great - instant throttle response, amazing handling, quiet ride, all the technology and 14 speaker sound. The music box is great, just drop in a CD and it records and stores it on the hard disk, up to 2900 songs! Also, it is the largest and easiest to get in and out of in it's class! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second M35S as I also had a 2006. The ride in the 2009 is a little stiffer, but still comfortable for a car with 19" performance tires. The increase in power along with the 7 speed transmission makes for a great combination. The gas mileage is about the same as the 2006 at about 20mpg in mixed driving. Looked at Jaguar FX, Lexus GS, Acura TL and Audi A5. None could come close to the lease deal. Best value in its class. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, power, features and looks. Trouble free.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>How much do you have to pay these days for a car that does not rattle? In the first few thousand miles I have return this car for 3 rattles. Rattles in the dash and doors are making this car a major regret. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Room, controls, LED lighting, solid V6</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really love the 2009 M35-S. My previous car was a 2007 M35 Sport as well. The car handles extremely well, can excel quickly from a dead stop, and is very sporty inside and out. Even when taking the car in for service at the dealership, they tend to give M owners a little extra attention and they go out of their way to make you feel special. All in all, I'd recommend the M35 S to anyone. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SAT Radio, the new 303bhp engine and the power that comes with it, the smooth ride, and styling. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am very happy with this car. Solid ride, quiet, nice interior. Visually distinct lines on the car. Very responsive steering. Transmission shifts are smooth and close together. Coming off a 2004 Audi A6, the build and ride quality of the M seems much better. Averaging 19 mpg in mixed driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, acceleration, handling, rear wheel drive, bluetooth, voice command, exhaust note, smart key high quality feel and look, heated and cooled seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking to buy the new Lexus GS and then test drove the Infiniti m35S and was sold on it! I bought the car the next day! I love my first Infiniti. It has enough power to get me in trouble and is sexy on the inside and out! The interior is beautiful and I love the heated/cooled seats! Most car for the money on the road. Also, the Infiniti dealership was the best car-buying experience I've ever had. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated/Cooled seats, Back up camera, handling, beautiful leather & wood trim interior, BOSE sound</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The M35 is a dream machine. I got it with the Tech and Advanced Tech packages and the vehicle has exceeded my expectations. Driving is no longer about going from point A to B. Driving is the destination. The M35 is so much fun to drive and there is so much you can do while you are driving that it is a vehicle designed for efficiency. Lane Guidance works great, the review camera with a grid makes backing up a pleasure. Recently I slammed on the brakes at the last minute and the brake assist and seat belt tensioner kicked right in making me feel safe and secure. The power of the vehicle also makes it safe - it is possible to leap out of the way of a potential collision. Great, great car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 5.1 surround sound is too much fun although you have to buy designated music DVDs. The regular sound is excellent, too. The back up camera is a huge plus.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Took delivery of my new M35x 3 weeks ago. Just came out of a Lexus GS300 AWD. Although the Lexus was a little more "cushy" and had one or two more conveniences, this car is really the only other luxury vehicle that comes close in features, quality and value retention. The "M" definitely rides much better/feels glued to the road. Also has better electronics such as the navigation system which is easier to use and the sound system with the hard drive which records your CDs (very cool). I got the tech pkg, so I got the upgraded Bose system, but not the 5.1 system that comes with advanced tech pkg. Even though it is not their best, it still is far superior to the Lexus' Mark Levinson system.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system with hard drive, nav system, heated/cooled seats standard and solid but comfortable ride. Corners like a Mini.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car, we found, is one of the best investments for your money. Tons of options, spectacular entrance levels (the basic car is still outstandingly nice), and the appearance of the M35 all contribute to the brilliant design of this sedan. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dashboard, tail light design, navigation system control, African rosewood interior, "cornering lights" that automatically move the direction you turn, Infiniti embroidered logo on seats, and the air conditioned/ heated leather seats. Also the push button start is very "James Bondish" in my opinion.</FAVORITE>
