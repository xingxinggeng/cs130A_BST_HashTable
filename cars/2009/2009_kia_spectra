<TEXT>Haven't owned it long, but so far more impressive than expected. Plenty of pep and super-quiet for the mondo freeway driving I do. Amazing fuel economy. Forget the EPA rating, I get 34mpg in mixed driving with the AC on most of the time! Picked it up for less than $11,000, with AC, CD and auto included. Lots of room, both front and back seats. Yes, the exterior and interior are simple, plain vanilla. I like that; pragmatism rules. And I'll agree that this is less solidly made than a Toyota. But for $5,000 less, well worth it! The lack of ABS, though, is shameful. All cars should have ABS standard these days; law should require it. CU gives good reliability ratings.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Price, warranty, quiet, fuel economy, space, smooth drive, easy handling and parking, simple and practical design.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle this past June so wanted to give it time before passing judgement. The peace of mind of having such a great warranty is priceless, and the added value of such a good MPG vehicle (getting 29 to 34) was an important factor. The controls are in easy reach, and the vehicle drives very comfortably. The interior is spacious and overall very pleasant to drive. I purchased the gold color with black and tan interior which gives off a mature but stylish feel to the vehicle. I never thought I would say this but so far this vehicle from Kia is a pleasure to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior controls are positioned well, standard stereo with CD sounds fantastic, good storage, quiet vehicle and runs nice, and the very attractive MPG.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This was my first ever new off the show room floor car. in years past I averaged only 9,000 miles a year driving. I've put over 15,000 on my Kia in its first year. the Mileage is great1 i'm getting from 28 to 30MPG combined city and freeway. I commute 15 miles each way to work, mostly freeway. good power, great profile in the looks dept. interior is well thought out and the engine compartment is not all crowded and packed. you can see where everything is! I will drive this car when I'm on call for work on the weekends rather than one of our beat up company vehicles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>the in-dash CD player, the room for 5 adults, the fold down seats when I need to haul cargo. great for the urban home owner who needs that option but doesn't want a truck! the great gas mileage and power even with the automatic. The "Electric Orange" paint stands out!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my very first car and I know I made a great choice. It takes less than $25 to fill up my tank and I am good for the rest of the week. The interior is comfortable and I get compliments on the exterior. For a first car or something that in inexpensive and good to drive get this car. It is also roomy for my family of four.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Max AC cools the car down quickly and the truck is very spacious.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was skeptical at first and concerned that i might not get 30 mpg. Have only had short time but first fill up 29.5 mpg and second fill up 32.2 mpg in mixed driving. Drives very smooth and handles well and looking forward to great mpg once it breaks in. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car saved my life, along with three passengers, when a drunk driver crossed into our lane. Its responsive handling allowed us to avoid a head-on collision, and the side-airbags minimized the seriousness of our injuries. Everyone in the accident thanked me for choosing this car after putting its safety to the test.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a Suburban for a Spectra, so the shock value alone took some getting used to. Overall, this is a great little car. Mechanically engineered well, great gas mileage (I averaged 34mpg the first weekend, 300 miles of mixed use), looks pretty decent parked next to a Nissan or Toyota. The "carpet" is more like some sort of fuzzy cardboard, we'll see how the rest of the interior holds up over the next 3-4 years. Overall, for the price I don't think you can beat this car in terms of warranty, safety, features, and performance. Sticker on mine was $17,250 - drove away for $10K after trading in a 1996 Suburban with 230K miles. Yeah, I keep them for a long time!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent gas mileage. Relatively quiet at highway speeds </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a new purchase. I was able to get the "Copperhead" color, so the car looks sharp & it has fog lights and a rear spoiler. Before you laugh at the spoiler, I was cruising the I-10 at 105 mph & this engine was up to the task. At 85 mph & below the cabin noise was minimal. I took some local back roads and the suspension was solid and the car felt glued to the road even as I took the curves at a goodly amount of speed. The brakes bring the car to a quick stop with no spongy fade. I look forward to taking my new Spectra on a long road trip to visit family in TN. The 700 mile journey will allow me to wring this car out & see if it holds up for the 11 hour drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The SX trim has the 6-disc CD player w/ 6 speakers. It sounds great & plays MP3 files. It has a remote start feature which is handy in bad weather. The driver's seat can be adjusted higher or lower which is great for me as I am 6'1". I love the fog lights as they make a difference.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looking for an inexpensive new car? Look no further. I just purchased the Spectra and couldn't be happier. Great warranty, fun to drive, and comfortable, compaired to my SUV, the gas guage doesn't move. Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase, and the Kia network of services. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased my first Kia and my first new car ever, drove it off the lot with 40 miles on the clock. I now have just over 1,000 miles on the car over the last 3 weeks. The car has mostly been used for city driving, my 35 mile R/T drive to work. So far I am very happy with the car. The gas mileage has been around 28 MPG in the city, but I do expect that to increase as the car continues to break in. One of the major selling points for me was the incredible warranty and the roadside assistance. The interior is a bit spartan but very well thought out. I love all the storage compartments in the car. The stereo is not bad for a stock system and I love my sunroof. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sunroof, warranty and great price. I have received many positive comments on the design of the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Our son crashed the family Ford Explorer. Used cars were high-priced. We decided to buy a Kia Spectra EX 4 door sedan for about $1500 more than it would have cost to get a 2005 used Explorer. Of course, we got a red one! I'm a car buff and this is one nice vehicle. Great gas mileage (averages over 28 mpg in mixed driving), peppy pick up, smooth ride, plenty of cupholders. The car came loaded with options - AC, automatic headlights, extra 12 volt chargers,and even an iPod port. Safety ratings on this car rival those of Toyota and Honda, and exceed those of the Ford Focus. All for about $14000, including delivery, tax and license fees. I love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The automatic lights are great - the battery doesn't die if you forget to turn off the headlights. I also really enjoy the smooth ride and quick acceleration onto the highway. Since I commute 30 miles each way, I also appreciate the comfortable and readily adjustable seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought my first Kia. Usually as a workhorse we go with Hyundai (same company now) Love the Spectra5. The dealer was easy to work with, and after 40 years of buying cars, I had a good experience. I would recommend the buying experience alone, but the car also.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty looking, fun to drive, and doesn't cost an arm and leg</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car handles the curves on the road very well. The gas mileage is excellent. I think it's even better than the Ford Focus. I like the fact that it has a sporty look. The spoiler is a great addition. I needed a car, check out the dealership and price and rode off into the sunset with a brand new vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior design. The price. The steering.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased this car to drive to school (260 miles round trip) four days a week. It gets 36-38 mpg and rides surprisingly well. Good build quality especially for the price. Never owned a kia before but if the quality of this car is indicative for the rest of their line I see an Amanti in my very near future. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great MPG and safety features. Warranty</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Why</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>As you approach this car it seems like a fairly handsome vehicle. It has clean lines, just a nice amount bling to it. Climb in and start going and you will quickly be disappointed. The wind noise is horrendous. That's ok though you can get used to it after a while, and the stereo can be turned up loud enough to overcome the noise. No, the worst part about this car is that in 2009 a car still has ABS as an option? What are they thinking? You get side airbags, but I'd rather avoid an accident by having ABS.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have waited to write this for a few months because everyone loves their new car in the first couple of weeks. Four months later still finding that I love to drive this car. The styling of the Spectra 5 sticks out from others. Very affordable to operate and the features for the money are great. Never looked at a KIA before this purchase but will look there first for the next one. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Has space but looks sporty at the same time. All of the standard equipment, warranty and affordability. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I waited 5 months to write this review because I wanted time to adjust to the car. Overall, its a good value for the money. I also test drove the Corolla and Civic, but the low price and excellent warranty is the reason I chose the Spectra. Handling is responsive and the car meets my needs very well. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The fuel economy is great, the car looks nice, love the IPOD jack</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After comparing prices on the '07 to the new '09 KIA Spectra EX I decided to go with the '09 mainly based on price and having full warranty. I give this car straight 9s across the board... very happy with my purchase so far. I have even used the roadside service because I left my lights on and ran my battery dead. Called kia and they sent someone with no problems and limited info. They even called me back to make sure someone came to help. Will buy a KIA again!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The price. Warranty. Great gas mileage. Sporty.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My previous car was an 03 Focus. The Spectra is much more zippy in acceleration, yet has the same size engine as the Focus. And fuel economy is 20 percent better. I like how spacious the engine compartment is, in terms of accessibility to hoses, belts, battery, etcetera. These items are easy to see and inspect. And replacement, when necessary, should not be difficult. What I miss about the Focus is the softer seats. The Kia seats are are quite rigid. What I have a concern about is the cable actuated gas cap door. Cables and plastic latches fail in cold climates. I may have to improvise a better system to insure I can refuel in the winter.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The price. The zippy acceleration, yet I get 37 mpg on the highway. Ease of inspection and access to external engine components. Spacious interior room. Steering is very tight and responsive. Oil filter is very accessible, as are the exhaust sensors.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have personally been watching this car for 3 years. I'm glad I waited to buy after the 2008 model year. Kia has improved the styling tremendously by getting rid of a lot of the plastic skirting. This car has a clean appearance. The five spoke wheels are a plus over the old eight spoke alloys. This car is a hoot to drive, especially with the stick. The engine has good low end torque. Regardless of what you read or hear about this car, I say if you're interested go test drive one. Personally I see me driving this car for more than 100,000 miles. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>What can I say? At $19,445.50 out the door (MI sales tax 6%) and add all of the standard features that you pay extra for with every other manufacturer, you can't go wrong; four wheel disc brakes, all power features, side curtain air-bags, good sound system, the list goes on.</FAVORITE>
