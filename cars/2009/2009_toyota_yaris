<TEXT>Love the gas mileage and low fuel costs! Very Comfortable on long trips for my 5ft 7 inch frame. Very quiet! I can hold Blue Tooth Cell phone conversations at highway speed. Love the small car maneuverability after years of driving a Dodge Grand Caravan. Very quick steering and short turn radius.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted a reliable, fuel efficient vehicle to get me to work, store, etc. This is it. I've had this car 10 months, put 16K miles on it, and it hasn't given me an ounce of trouble. On an average tank of gas, combination of highway/town, I get between 39-41mpg. I run 80mph on the interstate with plenty left, handles great. The dash in the middle takes getting used to, and the corner posts are too thick, impeding vision, especially backing out of a parking place, I would like to see a tach, temp gauges. Besides that, this car is great. No regrets.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We love this car. It is everything we were looking for in a small commuter car. My wife calls it the Hummingbird, because it requires so little fuel to get around. We chose the "S" and Power package, which gives you all the features you need. My only complaint is that the Turn-signal indicator is too quiet. We choose the Manual 5-spd and have no regrets. Seats are firm, visibility is OK, center-mount dash layout takes a little while to get use to, but is very nice at night, since there is no light distraction directly in front of you. And we love the style and look of the "S" model.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage is wonderful. Parking is a snap.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Really enjoying my 2009 Yaris liftback. Very quiet inside cabin while driving in town or on highways. Getting about 400 miles per 11 gallon fill up from 50/50 city and highway driving. Very responsive handling and without bending my neck do not hit my head while getting behind the steering wheel. I'm 6'0 tall. Car seems much larger sitting inside than when looking in from the outside. This is the first time I was able to get 2 vehicles inside my 2 car garage and with plenty of room to spare. The lift back door does not hit my garage door when both are fully opened and I can still stand up straight underneath the lift back fully opened with a couple inches to spare.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The instrument panel "cyclops" central location is an excellent idea. I no longer have to look over or through the steering wheel to see the speedometer. There are 3 large compartments that open up on the dashboard. One is right in front of the steering wheel and other two on the right side of dash.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great car except for driving. Poor handling, steering imprecise at highway speeds, shifting into 5th is clunky, visibility out of vehicle poor (thick door posts, headrests block lines of sight), bigger blind spot than my old car. Our old 1978 or 1981 Civics would eat the Yaris alive and spit out the pieces. Driving is now a chore, not an enjoyable experience. No ash tray (good for storing insurance card, etc.), no external antenna (degrades reception), speedometer needle hard to see when wearing sunglasses, have to check proper operation, but rear seat seat belts seem to be obstacles when the seat is down. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car as a third car for my commute. I have a Tacoma but the gas was killing me. My wife drives a Prius but we did not feel like spending 24,000 for another car. We got the Yaris for 13,000 out the door and it has been great. No problems at all. Fun to drive, first few tanks of gas has been averaging 36- 39 mpg. Very fun to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage is wonderful. Not 50mpg, but, 40 for a third of the price. Really enjoy the ease of driving around town.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We are very happy with our choice. The Yaris ended up being exactly what we needed. This car looks tiny but has a bunch of room. A 6-ft, 160 lbs man can sit comfortably in the rear seats. Keep in mind this is an inexpensive economy car. What got that, combined with reliability, quality and somewhat surprising performance. A Toyota will hold its value far better than other competitors in this area (Kia, Hyndai) - except perhaps Honda, which costs quite a bit more. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had this car four months and I already have 20,000 miles and nothing has gone wrong. I am in my car all day for about 175 miles on average and I have nothing to complain about. Sure it's not the fastest thing in the world but who expected that? And everything else about it is perfect. Mine stays in a straight line for hours. Not to mention perfect gas mileage for not even being hybrid. I may not know everything but I love this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For a subcompact car, this one delivers. Awesome fuel mileage is the deal on this car. It won't burn the tires off with take off, but you're gonna get at least 42 mpg with cruise and a/c on! Turn off a/c and cruise, and you're getting 50 mpg. The car is zippy, and contrary to opinion, big trucks do not blow you off the road. The thing will turn on a dime. Park anywhere. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Can we say awesome mpg's? This is a no-brainer people. If you want to spend an extra 10 to 15 grand on a hybrid, that's your choice. Six airbags and abs brakes come standard.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has the absolute WORST driveability of any car that I have recently driven. This purchase is a HUGE MISTAKE and I have nothing but REGRETS!!. It DOES NOT GO IN STRAIGHT LINE ON THE HIGHWAY!!!!!! It needs CONSTANT, and I mean CONSTANT, steering corrections to keep it going straight ahead. So your arms get EXTREMELY tired in a very short time (And yes, I've checked the alignment SEVERAL times). I had a friend's 2000 Geo Metro Hatchback for a couple months last year, and that car tracked waaaayy better (and that's a $1000 car for crying out loud!!!!!!!). It is impossible to take this car on anything more than a half hour drive without feeling your arms are going to fall off!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the 4 door, as I sometimes have to use a carseat, manual trans. I bought this car to commute to work 100 miles/day 5 days/wk. I get average 40 MPG at avg. 70 mph. Great on gas! Comfortable. Large trunk. I have a 3 y/o who sometimes rides with me, we have a larger carseat, it fits! I have not been disappointed with this buy! I have put 8000 miles on it so far!</TEXT>

Getting 40.4 mpg on pure highway driving trips now! Car has plenty of get up and run! No car is perfect..but I promise you will enjoy this car </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great gas mileage and plenty of energy for a sub compact car. A real heard turner car with more interior room than you think! Center dash instrumentation instead of right in your face.

<TEXT>I bought this car because I wanted a car that will get me from point A to point B, & to do it in reasonable comfort & with 100% reliability & to do so over 200,000 miles. I've not been disappointed in the first 5,015 miles. No problems, no surprise mechanical sounds, & the manual tranny is as smooth as an automatic tranny. I changed the oil at 600 miles & wish I'd changed it at 500 miles because it was BLACK. Subsequent oil changes at 1,500 mile intervals have been relative clean. I really like the TIGHT 180 degree U- turn diameter </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>42.2 mpg over 5,015 miles, 38 Degree AC temp at the air outlet when outside air is 107 degrees, 186 degree heat temp at the air outlet when outside is 45 degrees, The instrument panel in the center of the dashboard is where the panel should have been right from the beginning for all autos</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I originally planned to get a used Camry or Accord but found that vehicles 2 years old with 40-60k miles cost more than my new Yaris. When I first saw the Yaris I almost laughed as I am 6'4" and I thought "No way will this work". I got in and was quite surprised at the room for my legs and head. I also had tried out a Scion HD and my head was touching the ceiling. And to be honest, I really liked the Honda Fit....but not for $3,000 more. First tank I got 37 mpg and I have had it a month now and have filled up twice. Don't miss the weekly visits to the gas station. The manual trans is smooth and fun and the center instrument panel and controls are just fine. No regrets! </TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2 reasons I bought this car is reliability & economy. After 5,000 miles I'm getting 41.6 mpg, the a/c put our 40 degree of cold air today when the outside temp was 107. Back in Jan. this car's heater put out 182 degrees when the outside temp was 45 I am very pleasantly surprised at how efficient the a/c is on a very hot day here in Phoenix, Arizona. My only complaint is the lame squeak that is the HORN & the multiple reflections off the rear window from headlights behind me, at night.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The location of the instrument cluster in the center of the dash, it's where the instruments should have ALWAYS been located. Really tight turning radius, the 40 degree a/c output on a 107 degree day. The 182 degree heat on a 45 degree day. The electric steering.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my 2005 Corolla for the Yaris 2 door hatchback w/power package. My insurance decrease, my payment dropped significantly, and I get lots of oohs and ahhs from friends and colleagues. The car is extremely economical. I'm getting a tad under 34 mpg around town: I have yet to do the highway, longer drive scenario. It is roomier than the Corolla was.... has more safety features, and is just fun to drive. It's a great second car backed by Toyota reliability!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded a fully loaded Mazda 6 and have no regrets. This little car is awesome! The 2 door Yaris is easy to drive, perfect for around town, commuter or second car. The seats are extremely comfortable. General driving, no freeway, 1500 miles, 36 and 37 mpg. Lots of head room, seems large inside, love the European look ? better than all other competitors. 5 speed manual is extremely smooth. My wife and I really love this little car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My intention was to purchase a Camry because I prefer larger cars but I took a look at the Yaris as a basis of comparison. I was pleasantly surprised with the room this car has inside. Outside it appears very small, esp. the 2-door. This is why I chose the sedan. Inside is really cavernous. It came with ABS & side airbags standard & gas mileage is AMAZING. Quality is great. If it was cheaper by $1000 it would be a perfect 10 in my book.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I run a lot of miles, over 30k last year, and love the fuel economy of this thing. With the AC on, I was averaging 42 mpg last summer. During the winter I averaged over 37 mpg. I have more leg room in this car than in my old Ford Taurus in the back seat. You do have a tighter fit in back, but have found that 2 car seats for the kids work perfectly with the pull down armrest. The controls are a bit hard to figure out initially, but now I have a hard time in any other vehicle. The cruise was a bit difficult to find, but now is intuitive. The coupe should have the same storage features that the Hatch does, but that is my only complaint.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I rented a similar Yaris last summer, and got 39 mpg's. My Mazda 5 was out of warranty and I was intrigued with this little cruizer again and gave up some room and features for the economy of the Toyota Yaris S. I like the look of the S model. I miss the steering wheel controls I had on my Mazda, and the plastic in the yaris smells funny in a cheap way, but the car seems to run on vapors, and rarely needs a fill up. Fun to drive, parked next to a Mini Cooper the other day, and loved the way the S looked sitting next to a much more expensive car, great stance!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first stick shift. I love the look of this car. After looking at multiple used cars I decided that it was a better deal to get the yaris. I have found it to be very easy to learn how to drive a manual on this car, and it definitely gets up and goes when you tell it to. I only drive about 15 miles to work but the mpgs on this car are amazing and save me a lot of money on gas. Overall the inside does feel cheap, but that's what you get in an economy car. Overall a great little car.</TEXT>

My wife and I both have marveled at how quickly you're doing more than the speed limit. Good thing we got cruise control!! Lots of legroom, more than a Corolla or an Accord. Headroom is a bit tight if you're over 6' tall. Just a fun, zippy little car with great gas mileage. You'll feel like you're driving a sports car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got this to replace my Mazda3 that was wrecked in, of all places, a funeral procession. Was suspicious when the dealer dropped the price from $17K to $14.5K without even me trying. After trade I walked out paying less than $5K. Has all the goodies, including alloys, alarm, upgrade tires and interior, power pack, etc. Runs smoothly and accelerates just as fast as the Mazda3 although it does lose mid range steam. Originally thought the gas gauge was broken but it seems I'm getting about 33 mpg in the city! No problems as of yet and I hope it stays that way.</TEXT>

It drives nice, better build quality and material then my '06 Corolla. Lots of standard safety features. It gets so many looks, with the colors alone. I love it and I am very happy! Most people really like my car too! Its not meant to be a speeder, but it does take off quickly when needed! The brakes are great too! I love the little side blinkers on the 2 door.</TEXT>

I got 35 mpg on first 2 tanks. It drives smooth. Sitting position is excellent. Ingress and egress is better than my Acura. Lots of safety features and a good stereo. I saw a car like this hurling down autobahn at 110 miles an hour last week. My girls call it a little blue jelly bean and prefer to go in this car than our Acura TSX or Toyota Sienna. There is a lot of leg room in the back. Just a fun little car. Toyota should also offer the diesel with this one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a conflicting experience with this car. We made 2 long trips in this one, one was 4000 miles/5 days long to a remote area in TX. If you live in a city, have 55 MPH speed limit?it is a great car. Roomy inside (I?m 6?4??have plenty of space), nice MPG. If you have to operate it daily above 65 MPH?don't buy it. The car has a horrible problem with oversteering. It is not a defect, it is a design issue. Electric buster is too sensitive, so on a high speed forget about your cell phone?a small bump can be deadly. My wife got into an accident after trying to honk when doing 70 MPH: couldn?t hold the car with one hand, lost control and went into a ditch. The car is OK, but it tells a lot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is fantastic! I test drove both the manual and the automatic, and the manual is just wonderful. The clutch is smooth and it handles great. This little car can get up and go! One thing I love is how roomy it is, even though it looks like small from the outside. I can fit my sculpture supplies in the back no problem, especially after folding down the seats. I thought the speedometer in the middle would be a problem, but I've had no issue with it all, and I don't think anyone should let that hold them back from this great car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>If you want reliability and economy, you choose the right car. If you want a luxury car with bell and whistles - forget it. I love this car for the gas mileage and reliability. I get anywhere from 33 to 36 miles a gallon 50/50 city and hwy driving - mostly no air conditioner. The car is noisy with hwy driving. I recommend getting the power package for the four door sedan (I have manual doors). It can be a hassle unlocking and locking all the doors when you have passengers. I use this car for work, so I needed a reliable car with good gas mileage. The seats are OK, not very comfortable, but good enough. The engine is peppy, but going up steep upgrades is a little difficult. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So far so Good! Very impressive pep for such a small car. Runs smooth at 80 or at 18mph. Also this little car turns on a dime! Really fun to drive! Reasonably quiet ride on decent road surfaces. A tiny bit more roady and harsh on bumps but what do you expect on a small wheel base car. Love the center dash display (except) the fuel gauge, odometer and accessory lights such as engine temp and light on indicators. Should be enlarged by at least one font size. It would be a bad thing if your engine over heat light comes on but the darn indicator bulb is so tiny that you never see it. Love the over-all appearance of the Yaris over anything else out their in this same size class of car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2003 Hyundai Accent 4dr got totaled in a rear end collision so I got a Yaris because it was the cheapest new car I could find. It's not a hot rod, but has good acceleration for around town and getting on the highway when I need to. It's roomier than it looks and at least for me, more comfortable than the Hyundai, and it feels more solid. Driving in daily stop and go traffic, I'm getting 32mpg. The solid feel of the car combined with front and side airbags make me feel safe on the road in it. Handling is good and the car is a pleasure to drive. I hope the stories I've heard about Toyota reliability are true, because I want to keep this car for a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Yaris for about 3 months now, and have had absolutely no problems. I love it. I live in DC and it handles like a dream and is easy to park in a notoriously hard-to-park-in city. True it doesn't have a ton of features, but I wasn't looking for that. This isn't a 'starter car' for me, but I would recommend it as a first car for anyone. I wanted something economical, but didn't want it to look or feel that way. My friend got a Honda Civic the same week I got my Yaris, and all of our friends like riding in my car better. :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I feel the greatest value in this car is found in the base models and that people who want more options would be better served with the Honda Fit. That being said, I love my Yaris. Mine has the dealer-installed TRD suspension parts (springs, shocks and rear sway bar). The package utterly transforms the cars ride and handling and gives it a Mini-like feel. The TRD package yields a very well balanced, fun to drive car and I'l highly recommend it to any enthusiast. I also installed the leather wrapped TRD shift knob, which flexes less than the factory rubberized plastic knob and yields a more direct feel to the shifter. Nice brakes, nice steering, acceptable seats, lots of storage, MPG!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Brakes are nice, optional TRD suspension parts are fantastic. Acceleration with the 5 speed manual is surprisingly brisk. The little car will pull past 110 MPH without much effort. I love all of the interior storage spaces.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We traded in our ford mustang for this car. We got the high end one with the McPherson suspension and manual transmission and so far we love it. Have had no problems, handles bad weather good and gets excellent gas mileage. The rear seat is surprisingly roomy for a sedan. Handling is fun to drive!! Will recommend to anyone. But only the manual transmission the automatic seems to stressed out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having weathered the past 3 years in an expensive German car lease (including $4.75 unleaded premium), I am a good example of the change in trend of consumer behavior. Bought my Yaris after a quick test drive and am in love with this cute little car. I obviously wanted (and needed) a car that was both inexpensive to own and operate, but also stylishly quirky and fun to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, high MPG and build quality.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car, both inside and out. I am getting 35 mpg on average and I think this number will go up after the winter is over. This car has everything I need and is a great commuter vehicle. It is roomy inside, I had two snowboards and some other equipment in the back with the back seats folded down and another person on the passenger side, no problem at all.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Simple design, manual transmission, great fuel economy, versatility.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking for a vehicle that was great on gas mileage, reliability and safety. After two + years of test driving and research, I settled on the Toyota Yaris 4 door lift back. I have no regrets over my choice. This car is fantastic! Lots of fun to drive and peppy to boot. It won't win any drag races, but the handling is fantastic. Tight turns, gets up to speed on the highway and is very stable even on windy days. Performed admirably in recent ice storm. I commute on a heavily trafficked highway with lots of construction vehicles and not once have I felt overwhelmed in this car. My gas mileage averages 38mpg with 70% highway, 30% city with conservative driving (no speeding).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Yaris for six months now and I still love it. I get over 40 mpg on the highway and mid to high 30s in the city. It doesn't accelerate fast but that isn't what I wanted. This car the best you can get without going hybrid. I got it on a lease but if it lives up to Toyota standards I'll probably buy it out at the end.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas economy, cargo space with the rear seats down, more leg room in the back than almost any VW.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a smart car to own. Relatively inexpensive to buy (unlike Prius), cheap to operate & maintain, and high resale value. Whenever I see the car from the outside, I think it's so small but inside, there's so much room for both front seat passengers. My wife didn't even want to look at one. After a test drive, she liked it more than the Fit or Versa. After 4 weeks and 1500 miles, I'm averaging 37 mpg, that includes some 80+mph freeway driving and steep mountain driving. The power is very adequate. The quality and resale are better than a Versa. The price was significantly lower than a Fit. The Korean makes are in this price range but aren't even in this league when it comes to resale. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Unique, clean interior with lots of storage compartments, I like the gauge location and love the driver's side glove box, ABS and 6 air bags now standard on 2009 models</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My daughter bought a 2007 Yaris and I fell in love with her car. I would have bought one much earlier, but they didn't come with a cruise control. Finally, the liftback came with a cruise control and I bought one. The ride is great. I drive from Indy to Chicago every week and have gotten 34 MPG in mixed driving. This is a fun car to drive and has a really smooth ride. It isn't a Lexus so you have some tradeoff, but overall, great value for the money and since it is a Toyota, I know it will last a long, long time! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turning. It is so small it can turn around in very tight spaces. Large cabin for such a small car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked this little thing up on a Sat night Dec 27th after testing it a couple days. I found it to be fun to drive and has a peepy little 1.5, it did 70 on the interstate with no sweat. I bought it mainly for the wife for a local run about, replacing the 92 Chrysler T&C which was getting to be a pain. I like pretty much everything about it right now, it has all the stuff it needs.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've always driven big cars like caddys, Lincolns, and even a 24 Lincoln stretch. The vehicle I turned in off lease to buy my Yaris was a 2005 Saturn Vue with a 3.0 6cyl and all the bells and whistles. I bought a baseline 2009 Yaris and was skeptical as to how well it would handle the roads and weather where I live. Today we had ice everywhere. In weather like this my Vue was useless but the Yaris handle the ice and the hills like a plow I swear never slipped once or even felt like it was going to. I will recommend this car to anyone who will listen I still think its a shoebox but man what it handles like a half track in bad weather.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, big inside, performance, and style. Mine is black in and out. I love the tight feel it has peppy little engine for a 1.5 4 banger. In all a hearty 2 thumbs up Toyota you made a believer out of a guy who only drove American!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you are looking for a cheap, reliable car, the Toyota is the way to go. My family has been using Toyota for 20 years and never has had problems. The Yaris is no exception. The styling of the car catches glimpse even more than the Honda Fit and Nissan Versa. The center mounted climate control, radio, and odometers create a very nice V look. Not the fastest car out there, but one that will get you from A to B at a decent pace. Acceleration is slow however buyers are not looking for a fast car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car's driver seat can be set to a perfect position of comfort even with someone of my height of 6 foot 3 inches. Gas millage is excellent. A lot a trunk and interior room. Nice style with the S model.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Only after a few days I'm loving this Yaris! Bought for commuting so I'll be putting some miles on the car. After trying several other cars it was an easy decision to take the Yaris. I'll write again after the break-in period.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Well designed interior. Very spacious and ergonomic. Love the exterior design as well!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In my opinion, people give out too many 10s these days, so I'm trying to make my review as realistic as possible. I've always driven a truck, but seeing the way the economy is and fluctuating gas prices, downsizing is the smart thing to do now. I don't have a lead foot, but I'm not always the most conservative driver and I'm getting 38 mpg doing about 30% city/70% highway. Looks great on the outside, the build quality is good. As far as reliability, I believe it was consumer reports that put it in its top 10 list of reliable cars at #7 so that's definitely a good thing. Overall, I'm happy with the car and recommend it to friends when they say "Nice bubble, do you like it?"</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage. Reliability (so far). Look of the vehicle. Simple maintenance. Surprisingly roomy for a small car. Heating and A/C work great. MP3 jack. Daytime running lights. Power package is a must (spend the extra cash for it, you'll thank yourself later).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We recently bought our Yaris and are very pleased with it. It is important to get the armrest as an accessory though. The fuel mileage is great so far. About 38 mpg. This car does not feel crowded on the inside though, but it fits nicely everywhere. If you are looking for a fuel efficient, economical car, this is a great choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Friends thought I was crazy selling my '07 Civic Si, and perhaps I was. Yet one month later I purchased the Yaris and don't miss the Si at all! Who needs 0-60 in 5.3 seconds? The Yaris is an economical, quality, and well thought out car by the Japanese automaker. I like the aerodynamics of the car, not to mention all the nooks and crannies. Fuel economy is on a par with the Prius, and the Prius costs about 10k more. Frankly, I'll take the Yaris at 15k and 10k of free gas. The hatchback is also fun to drive. I am 6'3" and have plenty of head and adequate legroom. The convenience pkg upgrade is worth the price. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new Yaris, 5 door, white hatchback, I absolutely love it, it looks like a cute little toy, it runs awesome, the storage inside the car is awesome, cup holders, the storage behind the steering wheel is great. The only thing I don't like is the lite on the dashboard, too loud. The room inside the vehicle is awesome, roomy for all, in the back is awesome two people fit awesome!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought a hatchback Yaris because it was a Toyota and I wanted a small car w/good mileage. I previously owned a VW beetle which I loved but it was getting too costly to own - so I went w/a Toyota mainly because of the reliability of the company. I owned Toyotas in the past and a Honda - I would've bought a Honda Fit but it was more expensive than the Yaris</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Size - I like small cars. Pick up - for a small car, it accels well</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned a Yaris for two years now, just upgraded to a 2009. I love it. There is so much space in the back seat, friends never complain, storage everywhere, I love the center console area , cup holders positioned perfectly. AMAZING gas mileage. Low cost maint. Because the car is so light weight it takes off quick even when getting on the free way. So no complaints about power. For the price it's worth it. The value of the car held on great. It's a great Car. Compare it to other cars similar to it and it stands out in price, style, comfort, and reliability. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The cool storage compartments. In one above the steering wheel I keep quick handy items like my cell phone, sunglasses, iPod. It's great. The center console looks cool. It streams down like a waterfall. It catches a lot of attention. And of course the gas mileage. It does great on freeway.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I owned a Toyota Echo, and drove it for 8 years with excellent satisfaction. I was hoping to drive it 8 more but was hit by another vehicle running a red light. Even so it handled beautifully and stayed upright. I searched to replace it and couldn't find another Echo. I looked for the closest thing..a 2009 Toyota Yaris. I love it. I recommend it. Gas mileage highway miles about 43 mpg. Plenty of pep and handles well. Try it, you'll like it:)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I always spilled pop on the cup holders in the center. Now they open and close and are hidden when not it use at the top dash area. I like that feature. Easier to clean. Good looks. Compact size maneuvers into parking spaces easily.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After my research & comparison on Toyota Yaris & Honda fit, I decided to get Yaris because it wins in most category & fit my needs for daily use. For two fill-ups, I got 41 MPG ( 40% city/ 60% highway) by driving it gently. It's amazing & almost as good as a Prius. The finish is excellent & the dashboard & charcoal fabric are nicer than others. The ride is smooth & relatively quiet. It accommodates 4 adults comfortably. The power & acceleration is outstanding for this small 1.5L engine. There is nothing to dislike.The only thing I don't like is that the power door lock/keyless entry is not standard. </TEXT>
