<TEXT>We recently purchased this vehicle because of the value. However, having owned the SUV for almost a month and 2000 miles. I can tell you this is very comparable to past higher value SUV's we owned (Volvo,Mercedes & Ford) This is the second KIA we have owned and the service and reliabilty has been wonderful. I would recommend KIA to anyone, and encourage them to shop KIA, regardless of budget</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a really great vehicle at a great price. Bought the V8 engine and love it..read some complaints on the 6 cylinder and since I tow a boat I wanted the V8 with the 6 speed transmission...works great and almost the same mileage as the 6 cylinder engine...Its a real joy to drive and love the 100,000 mile 10 year power train warranty!! Just got it a week ago so can't speak for reliability so far, but fun to drive...great quality vehicle at a low price..(KIA is giving $3,000.00 off right now) it's really a no brainer...almost bought a Honda Pilot but this is a much better vehicle at a much lower price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats are very comfortable..love the fact that it has a high and low range switch..great stereo and plenty of room with the third seat down.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great vehicle, really fun to drive on road or off. We upgraded from a RAV4 (too small) and weren't disappointed. Fuel economy improved greatly after a few long highway rides, and the rear fold down seats give lots of storage space for skis, dogs, groceries etc. It handles well in all road conditions, has a really comfortable ride for all passengers, and there is lots of room in the 3rd row seats for adults. We've had a few minor problems - door open sensor, a NOC sensor, programmable seat button doesn't work for position 2 but that's it. My only concern is that I have yet to see any other Borrego's on the road - I know they are out there somewhere, i'll just keep looking....</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>heated driver and passenger seats are great for coming home from the ski hill on a cold day. The rear fold down seats provide lots of cargo space too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had been looking at small to mid-size SUV's for a few years and saw the Borrego in a car show. I fell in love instantly - especially price for what you are getting. Was difficult to find the Limited 4x4 but found place in LA to buy and drove back to SF - was a great way to fully test the car and my initial feelings were confirmed - I love this car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quality of the interior; ease of use of features, including set up of car seat; great sound system; lots of space - greyhound fit easily in the back; decent fuel economy given the size (it's same as my Ford Escape V6 was)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Why pay 35K for a premium fuel pathfinder (that's a little smaller) when the safety doesn't even compare. Great car for a great price. I never dreamed in a million years I would own a Kia and now I have one and wouldn't trade it for the world</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased this truck after extensive research and review reading. Truck is great. Visibility is outstanding. Styling is sharp. Vehicle handles like a car. Only down side is the transmission is definitely gear wrong. Shifts to quick, but what I have found is kia has done this on purpose to help stop people like me from flooring it and wasting all that gas. When truck gets going it has balls. Features that come standard are extensive. Kia good job! I would buy this in a heart beat if I had to do it all over. Such a fun car to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have now had the Borrego for 1 week. Great purchase...7,000 off sticker. It is very comfortable and drives well. Traded in a 2001 Land Cruiser and the comfort and features are an upgrade while saving $40,000 on a new new Toyota. Now older and not doing the off-road stuff. This vehicle is very enjoyable.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the navigation and Infinity stereo. V6 is plenty powerful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love the Borrego. Everything is perfect except KIA. They did not and refuse to honor their web site presentation. (Dealer was excellent, headquarters not). There logic was some small print that I, to this day have not seen; they have the ability to change or delete features advertised on their website without notice to purchaser. The backup camera, previously included in the package I purchased was, at their discretion, deleted, but the package price was not adjusted. KIA said the package price did not include the camera, but it was listed in the package. I was told the camera was not available until 2010, but now it is in a new model, "limited" that was not even offered. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Beautiful finish, smooth lines inside and out. Performance has been excellent. Nothing but positive comments.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our new vehicle, "our" I mean my wife's. The test drive sold me. I have owned mostly ford products but owned enough other vehicles to know what is quality and what isn't. Borrego is no Mountaineer, the sheet metal could be a little thicker but the horsepower is OK. Anyways, Borrego is tough enough and fun enough for this Northern Minnesota resident. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I'm a man and I never get lost! So the navigation is a waste of electronics. My lovely wife absolutely loves it though. This vehicle is a go getter. it is clean and strong. Windshield wiper heating element, GENIUS!!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I tried and priced many other SUVs but, the BORREGO is the best deal for the money!!!! You get way more bang for your buck with this baby!! Its has all the comforts of the more expensive bands and drives awsome. I already sold two to other people that saw my Borrego. I spend a lot of time at my job driving around looking and/ or estimating jobs, so comfort is big, my BORREGO is like being in a lounge chair all day!! I would recommend this suv to anyone looking for a superior suv for a rock bottom price!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the best kept secret on the road.Good mpg(23.5 on recent interstate trip with cruise set @72mph). Comfortable ride,well placed,easy to use controls,vast cargo space with both rear rows down. Handles well,small turning radius, smooth powerfull engine. 5 star safety ratings except a 4 for rollover(it IS a suv). Better mpg than my '91 Cherokee,as much room as my '72 Suburban had,drives and handles better than either did. You do feel bumps in the road,but it doesn't beat you with them. It is after all a true 4wd, not a car. I researched vehicles for 3 years before I finally purchased this. I wanted a U.S. brand,but nothing came close in price,quality, or warranty. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Combination of power,mpg,& handling. Huge cargo capacity. Layout of controls.Tow hitch design. Rear park assist "Radar". Overall visibility from driver's seat. Comfortable ride. Extensive safety features. Ease of folding rear seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Drove a 1000 mile round trip in the last 4 days. We do this trip at least twice a year and this is the first vehicle we have owned, including a Honda Odyssey that my back doesn't bother me. Very comfortable. Gas mileage varied 21 to 23.5 at 70 to 80 mph. Pretty good for a vehicle this size.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Went with the LX for expense and I didn't want leather or the Nav system. Just the basics with 4wd. Totally impressed so far with the mileage (around 20 highway). Handles well and rides very quietly. Very happy with the purchase so far. The true test will be the offroad ability (8.5 inches of ground clearance concerns me). I looked for 4 months in California at multiple different makes and models. My requirements: 4wd with third row seats and room in the back for adults. There are other choices out there; however, the Kia had the best fit for your family. Most importantly, the price was about $10K under the competition and they threw in a 10 year 100K mile warranty on everything.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great visibility from the drivers seat and the kids are way in the back. It's peaceful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased the 3.8L V6 4 wheel drive on 12/13/2008. I am very glad I made this purchase. I did look at numerous vehicles in this and found the Borrego had more room, more options at a lower overall cost, and had a sharper look to it. I find the ride to be great-much like a car and you sit high like a truck. All controls are easy to find and use. I have the luxury package and rear seat entertainment package for the kids. I recommend this set up and the cost was not bad. Well designed and very comfortable. Third row seating has plenty of foot room and space with comfortable seats. A real pleasure to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Memory driver's seat, 4 zone climate control, comfortable heated seats, quiet ride, awesome Infinity stereo with Sirius, rear entertainment comes with 2 wireless headsets and independent controls for movie/radio, and tight turning radius for it size.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Interior has a cheap feel, scratches or scuffs easy. AC compressor makes a knocking noise and I only have 3400 miles on the vehicle. I have taken it in for repair twice and of course the noise isn't as loud while it's at KIA so they say it is normal. $27,000 luxury vehicle that makes a knocking noise while going down the road! I was a repeat buyer, but will no longer buy from KIA. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Wife wanted a comfortable and safe suv she could see out of. The Borrego passed with flying colors! This car is a pleasure to drive both in town and on a trip. We put over 1500 miles on it the second week a am totally pleased with this vehicle. Get the EX package, it's a great value. All seams all correctly aligned, outstanding workmanship.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It exceeded my expectations. Comfortable enough, room & space enough power, interior features and reasonable price. I thought it might be a little rough, but it totally shakes my assumption. This is really smooth and powerful engine. I was impressed! My current mpg is 23 mpg, which is good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm really pleased with my Borrego. It looks great and has all the features I want/need at a great price. People tell me when they take a close look at it that they didn't know Kia made a solid mid-size SUV. The ride is not as smooth as a sedan but much smoother than my pickup truck. My city MPG is holding at 19.5. I haven't been on a highway trip yet. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sound system is awesome!. I've never had an auto-dimming rear view mirror, it's great. Seat warmers, auxiliary inputs, tilt down side-view mirrors, and the backup alert are all great. I really like the safety features too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My borrego has truly exceeded my expectations. The nav system is amazing for being an OEM item. I especially like how much space is available when the seats are folded down. Towing = AMAZING. I upgraded from a Jeep Commander. And yes, it is truly an upgrade.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We drive 30,000 miles a year in our business. Traded Hyundai Santa Fe in for it, 2005 with 140,000. A pleasure plus much more room, great visibility. Even with the 6 cyl has more get and go than the 6cyl in the Santa Fe. Like the rear wheel drive. rides smooth and quiet, should have gotten the next upgrade. a great dealership made the process even better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought a 2009 Borrego for my family 3 weeks ago. We love the features and the comfortable ride that the vehicle provides. Fuel economy is as advertised at 21 mpg, which is not bad overall considering the size of the vehicle. We are very pleased with this vehicle and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power telescoping steering wheel is great! DVD system is awesome as well.</FAVORITE>
