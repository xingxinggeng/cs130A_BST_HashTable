<TEXT>My BMW is under 6 months old with less than 4000 miles and has been back to the dealer for the same problem. It has an annoying vibrating sound from the engine. The dealer changed the power steering pump and problem still exists; now I am told it might be an engine mount. I would like to return this truck because I am fed up of the inconsistency of what a new car should have. I should have kept my infinti qx4.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a dealer demo with 8000 miles. Paid $51K pre-tax, sticker of $63K, Invoice of $57K. Included $4500 eco credit. Dealer extended Warranty to 55,000 miles. I have driven 3000 miles so far and can find nothing to fault. Performance and handling is superb. There is no turbo lag if you use kick-down mode or shift to M1 for quick starts. Hiway accel is gutsy, mind the staties. I-Drive is easy to use, but it helps to practice when you are not driving. The Nav is DVD based but terrific. BMW Assist lets you download locations from Google Maps. Cool. I drive a lot in my job. Mileage averages 21mpg around New England and Boston. 27mpg on a long hiway trip at 75mph to 80mph.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car drives and handles great. From a pure driving perspective, it is probably the best SUV I have ever had. However, it has some serious flaws in the interior. The navigation system is terrible and almost impossible to use. The all in one computer system for using most features in the car is also not easy to use. Something simple like changing the air from your head to your feet takes way too many steps to do. The car just feels over engineered. Also, don't believe the maintenance is included sales pitch. I just got my 10,000 mile done and all it covered was an oil change and not rotating and balancing the tires.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration and driving performance. Luxury feel for long drives.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked up a demo w/7500mi on it. Loaded with most options. The torque is plentiful, if switched to sport mode, it's even sweeter. Drove 1500+miles in 5 days and had no body aches. Very precise steering and fantastic brakes. The turning headlights and fog lights illuminate the roadway very well. Sound system is also amazing. This SAV is a blast to drive. It's my wife's so don't get to drive it much, but I feel good to have my family travel in this solid vehicle. Good crash ratings. Everyone says that the i-drive is a pain, however everything new in the world of electronics has a learning curve, once you master it, its all intuitive. Patience is a virtue. Lastly we got 27mpg on our road trip.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just picked up my brand new X5 last month and I am very impressed with it so far. I drive 100+ miles per day so a comfortable ride is very important to me. I had my X5 built and I chose the ventilated seat package which was well worth it. The seats adjust in so many ways and the massage feature for the driver is great! My black sapphire X5 turns heads when its clean and the interior is impressive with the brushed aluminum trim giving it a sporty look. The driving position is great and the car is pretty quiet at 70-80mph on the highway. Also, the premium sound system upgrade sounds great and I also like the iPod interface. I would highly recommend this SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been researching an SUV (Landcruiser, Nissan Patrol, Discovery 3 or Bimmer) for 4 months and after a lot of deliberation went for the X5 turbo. I couldn't be more thrilled with what I got. The turbo is smooth and delivers great performance and yet is amazingly fuel efficient for a large vehicle. I'm 6'3" and so there is plenty of space, great driving position and visibility. I had an E90 325 manual and the X5 isn't any slower and the handling isn't vastly different. My wife thought paying this much for a car ($90k Aussie) was ludicrous but she's already a convert - "it's very comfortable isn't it??" She never liked the 325. So I'm wrapped - so far anyway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 6th X5 and probably my favorite. I like the idea of driving clean-diesel and a more fuel efficient SUV without much trade off in performance and comfort. Acceleration is excellent; it feels faster than performance numbers indicate. Diesel engine clatter does not intrude into the cabin; you would not know it's has a diesel engine from the interior. I custom order my BMWs and this one took only 9 days from production start to delivery.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort seats are a must-buy option. Heads up display. Taught suspension. Tight build quality. Upgraded sound system is very good. Roomy interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased this as a demo vehicle, have put over 4000 miles on it so far. The diesel is amazing. This thing has power! My wife drives it to work every day on the freeway, getting about 28mpg on the highway. Our combined average is 24.5 (according to the computer). Very comfortable to drive. We do have the 3rd row seats and they are pretty useless except for kids under 12. We checked out the VW Tourareg TDI as well and liked it too, very much. Almost got it instead, but we got better financing through BMW Financial. No regrets. Engine can use B5 biodiesel according to the manual, and I have been using that as well. No issues. (I mix 100% biodiesel at 20:1 ratio with regular diesel).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, mileage, ride, power. The bluetooth works well, and the iDrive is nice once you understand it. The large double-opening sunroof is very nice. Backup camera includes dynamic indicators showing your path as you move the steering wheel. Sounds/feels like a big V8.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The diesel engine is perfect for this SUV.It is very solid and the transmission shifts smoothly. The ride is better than my previous SUV, a Mercedes ML500. The iDrive is very frustrating and the navigation system is poor compared to the older Mercedes system, and can't begin to compete with a $200 Garmin. There is no setting to automatically fold the power mirrors when locking the vehicle, and the front parking sensors are not full time - when pulling into my garage I must stop and push a button that also turns on the rear camera to check on the front. Amazingly, BMW does not include floor mats as standard equipment and they must be purchased separately from the dealer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The AC system is excellent and a one button push turns the fan to high and the setting to 60; after cooling another button returns the system to presets.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first SUV, or should I say SAV... what got my attention at the dealership was the exterior styling of this vehicle. Also, having never owned a spacious and roomy vehicle, I thought it was time for a change. What I love about my new X5 is the driving position because you sit up very high and the car has very good visibility all around. I also love the panoramic sunroof. I am not sure how I feel about the leatherette seats... they feel kind of rubbery although they seem very durable. I must say the seats are extremely supportive on long trips and adjust in many ways. I feel BMW should try to improve fuel economy in the gasoline engines as I did not want a diesel. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bi-Xenon Headlights, corona-rings on headlights, and cornering lights. Driving position. Roomy interior. Panoramic Sunroof. Awesome braking power for a 5,000lb vehicle! Cool shifter. Memory key settings very cool and easy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>While my 2009 X5 4.8i only has about 300 miles on it total I've got to say I wake up in the morning looking for places to go just so I can drive this awesome piece of machinery, and I work out of my house. The Pros: Awesome Handling, macho-good looks (especially with my 20" y-spoke sport wheels), solid German engineering, thicker than average sporty steering wheel and powerful. The Cons: Beside the fact I have already had it in the shop for two full days due to two (conicidence? I think maybe not) bad front tires that was causing my car's steering to pull there aren't a whole lot of cons. The i-Drive interface is a joke! BMW has some work to do and could take some pointers from Lexus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A brief update on my initial (3/1/09) review of my X5 diesel: Now at 5,025 total miles. Average mpg now 21.1 - even though average speed is only 28.5 mph (most of my driving is urban, much of that on the very hilly streets of San Francisco). Most impressive of all - not one single thing has needed repair or even minor adjusting. This is a first for me. Over the years I've been fortunate to have only had brand new cars, never used. One VW, one Lexus, five Mercedes, two Range Rovers, and one Toyota. Loved them all in one way or another, but all had needed overnight stays in the shop at least twice or more at this point in their lives. A BMW, made in SC, tops them all - amazing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had a 3.0 X5. Test drove Audi, Lexus, Acura, BMW gas, and fell for performance of X5 diesel. After 7,000 miles I am actually trading it in for MB ML350 diesel. BMW just not as comfortable. Seats not as supportive. Engine can be too loud. Satellite radio comes & goes. Passenger seat grinds/clicks when moved. Steering wheel squeaks when moved. Rt side speakers go dead on iPod integration. Need to roll the window up/down a few times to get speakers back. Steering wheel does not telescope long enough for 6-1 height. Engine performance is incredible. Second seat leg room is great. Cargo space is great. Just want more refinement. Maybe I am getting old.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine performance is phenomenal. The gas pedal is responsive at any speed. 26mpg hwy is real. Handling is solid. iDrive system is easy and intuitive. Plenty of cargo space for 3 ice hockey bags. Good second seat leg room.</FAVORITE>

<FAVORITE>The i-drive system is great, it could not be better. I own a 2006 Audi A6 and its computer is easier to use than my 2007 BMW 5-series' computer but my 2009 X5's computer is easier to use than both of them. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got my X5 less than a week ago and I love it. I saw the 2010 iDrive on a couple of other BMW models. I became afraid that I bought too soon before the 2010's came out. Hey this car handles awesome and is super comfortable. The fat wheel looks burly. I like the electronics and computer stuff. Sound system is way better than I expected, and I am a picky guy. I'm tired of Mercedes Benz and the way they treated me. When I got the X5 my blackberry connected easily with the bluetooth. With Mercedes, blue tooth only worked with Motorola and Verizon. That stinks, they went out of their way to make things more expensive and harder. BMW beats Mercedes in handling and steering in my book. Bye bye BENZ.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>iDrive, Comfort seats, interior is awesome, panorama moonroof, light leather and black headliner and Bamboo wood, Junk compartment under floor in cargo area and this thing handles amazing and is smooth. Night and day from Mom's 2002 X5 (without sport package), better.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my Mercedes GL450 because we wanted something slightly smaller, but not give up the utility, and luxury-comfort. The X5 hits that mark perfectly. It has sporty handling but is still luxurious and quiet. Gets 20 MPG which is great in my book. I'm 6'4" and 300 lbs and am super comfortable in it, and... my kids have room in the second seats!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd X5, my X5 35d has less features than my last one... I wanted the 35d and didn't want to order. I get 20 mpg in town, going long distance 35mpg. Great torque, better going uphill than gas engine. Better blue-tooth than previous years, have to let computer system boot...gives chance for car to warm up. Get Rear- Climate package...didn't get like past X5s...should have been patient and waited. My wife will be getting one when her 335 lease is up. 2 SUV family...best value and drive in its class. Must get running boards to finish off the look.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the 35d last week it is a great car, fun to drive and the interior is elegant yet contemporary. The I drive with noted improvements, is still cumbersome and I have to duck my head to get into the vehicle. The windshield is swept a bit too far back creating an entry obstacle. However I still highly recommend this vehicle as it is state of the art and well worth the price! Driving is a pleasure, the turbo diesel is responsive and zippy! Ride is all you would expect from a car of this caliber. Cup holders are positioned well and there are plenty of auxiliary electronics ports. My wife doesn't care for the engine vibration at idle. The passenger climate controls are great. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats are great I upgraded to cooled seats so you get the sport seats which are fabulous. The diesel engine is a joy to drive and connects the driver to the car. I averaged 19.7 mpg in the city. I have yet to test the fuel efficiency on the HWY but expect it to achieve better than 26mpg displayed</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've led a double life for years. I'm a committed environmentalist, and at the same time I'm an SUV lover. I love SUV's because I'm 6'4", I'm claustrophobic, and I have a kid, dogs and a horse so I need to be able to haul a lot of gear. But I also totally believe that if we can't all reduce our carbon footprint our children's children will face some huge problems. So, two years ago I traded in my Range Rover for a Mercedes ML 500, and last month I traded that in for the new BMW X5 diesel. I got 12 MPG with the Range Rover, 15.5 with the ML 500 (both on premium), and so far (after 650 miles) I am getting 20.1 mpg on the X5. Not as good as a Prius, BUT WAY BETTER TO DRIVE.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1. Super smooth ride/drive. ML tranny was jerky - not this. Felt every bump on my Rover and ML - not on X5. 2. Awesome seat comfort (have the fully adjustable ones). 3. Amazing torque. I live in SF Bay area; we have BIG hills; X5 drives like I'm in KS. 4. I-Drive is EASY.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Huge problem with the battery system. The push start system has no accessory mode, therefore if the engine is not running and you turn it on to use the radio, phone, DVD, etc. The battery will drain in 15 minutes. No indicator, no warning, just dead battery. The dealer service departments say they have to put the car on a charger just to work on them or the battery will be dead. The BMW answer is you have to have the engine running "all the time". Forget the after engine turnoff heat, you can't use it. Forget the DVD player that logically you can't use while driving, but you have to keep the engine running. If you expect to use your car a lot like I do, forget it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been a long time Porsche/BMW/Mercedes driver and this is by far the best all around vehicle I have ever owned. I enjoyed my M3/997 more from a pure driver's standpoint but I can actually carry my dry cleaning home now. The new X5 is a terrific package and the diesel power plant completes it nicely. I have wanted a proper diesel power plant in a daily driver for some time now as the advantages during a daily commute are obvious: torque while being fuel efficient and low rev requirements to get the job done. It feels as quick as the V8 powered X5, however provides guilt free driving while in view of my Sierra Club neighbors.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the high quality interior and while some believe the interior isn't flashy enough, I appreciate the form follows function approach. I believe it will stand the test of time where many new interior design in other automobiles will date themselves quickly. Fuel economy and thus, fuel range A+++</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My last car was a Mercedes -- hated it with a passion. The BMW 528i I had previously driven for years felt sturdier and safer than the Mercedes! So I chucked the Mercedes and bought the X5. What can I say that hasn't already been said? Mileage stinks but you expect that with a 4.8L engine right? Otherwise, it's a great car that drives like a sports car and yet it's luxury all the way!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Went from a 2001 BMW X5 to a BMW 330i and now back to a 2009 X5. Needed the X5 to pull a boat, which it does with ease. The 2009 is much improved over the 2001 in terms of build quality. The 2001 X5 did have mechanical issues. I do miss the handling of the 330i but for a SUV, the 2009 X5 is as close as it gets!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am driving the all new 2009 X5 diesel since one month, approx. 1000 miles. Before I drove already the X5 3.0 I6 cylinder for 2 years and the X5 4.4 V8. The diesel engine fits that car best!! The torque is huge - no difference to the V8. The mileage is about 25 mpg, even in those days extreme winter temperatures. By the way I didn't had any winter problems so far. The 2008/2009 update to the X5 is significant to the older models, e.g. more space in back row and trunk. Also remote trunk opener, keyless comfort entry, rear view camera are nice features. I love my all new X5 35d.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first BMW. I compared it with '09 Acura MDX, '09 Lexus GX470 and '09 Infiniti FX50. I found myself coming to BMW X5 after test driving all the other SUVs in its class. I loved the fact that BMW covers all maintenance for four years which the others do not. This SUV has everything looks, speed, wow factor. I love the iPod integration, navigation is very easy to use, I love asking for options in any menu and then I know exactly what to say to get anything done via Voice commands. The fuel economy could be better but if you can spend $$$ for the BMW then gas is not a big deal for you. I love driving my Ultimate Driving Machine it drives like a dream!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just picked up my ordered BMW X5 xDrive35d (diesel) that I had ordered back in August 2008. Ordered every option possible (costly). It was worth the wait. The diesel is very quite and drives like a dream. The torque is huge and available at any speed. The twin turbo diesel engine does a magnificent job. There is absolutely no lag at all. You punch it, and it goes. With that much power, you really do not need the big 4.8i. I was debating between the diesel and the 4.8i for the longest time, but now I am very glad that I went for the diesel. Picked up the x5 2 weeks ago with a full tank. Drove 500 km and still have more that quarter tank of fuel left. Fuel mileage, so far so good. </TEXT>
