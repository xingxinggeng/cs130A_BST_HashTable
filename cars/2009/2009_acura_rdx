<TEXT>My wife got the car and she seems happy with it, but I think the lack of visibility out the back is dangerous. The rear window is very small and then further blocked by the driver's headrest. Visibility out the driver's side is also bad because of the frame between driver and passenger windows. The real problem is the delay in acceleration which is maddening. Delay is usually 1 second but if you really need to pull in front of a car to make an exit you need to know it may the sequence which is engine revs, wait a second, wait a second, and then car accelerates, but not quickly. I can't believe this is supposed to be a premium car. Also high hood blocks forward view a little.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my RDX for nearly three years on a lease and I will be turning it in and not getting another. The gas mileage is well below what is listed at 17mpg in town. I live in Boston and drive around town and get about 11/12 miles per gallon, and I'm not a lead foot. The Turbo is not as responsive as it should be--there is some lag, but it is not bad when it kicks in. Just not as perfect as the sales people tell you it is. The interior is basic. Visibility is routine. Body design is nice. But the interior trim is just an upgraded version of a Nisson X-Terra. I question if my "leather" seats are really leather. They remind me of the Mercedes leather- like material I had in my Turbo D. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car! I have an Acura MDX too but this thing is fast. The seats are very comfortable, cabin noise is minimal. I do not understand the poor mileage complaint. I have driven the car for last 7000 miles and I have consistently gotten around 22 mpg. Nice leg space in rear seats. Good sound system. Great value for money and without sacrificing the fun part. Fast acceleration when needed. If you are looking into CR-V or RAV4 with all options, please buy this instead. Worth it! Nice ride too. Truly, not bumpy at all. They must have and 'have' softened the suspension since the original 2007 model. Its as good as any other SUV. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, precise handling, very comfortable and adjustable seats. All the needed options in base come as standard. Huge center console space. SH-AWD works, had no trouble driving on icy/snow covered roads.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I absolutely adore this SUV! I drove a mid-size sedan for many years and it did take some time to adjust to the RDX. The tilt down mirror on the passenger side is wonderful when backing. The interior is well laid out with all of the controls within easy reach. The center console is deep - it holds my large purse with room to spare. The front seats are comfortable and there's ample knee space in the rear with the front seats all the way back. Ride is firm - you feel some of the bumps and hear a little road noise, but the fun factor outweighs any of this. Fits my small family perfectly. Represented an excellent value for the money compared w/competition. Currently get 19 mpg city.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is not the luxury car that Acura should be selling. Unlike other Acuras, the vehicle does not have automatic headlights, a basic safety and convenience feature available on similar, and many far less expensive cars. The gas mileage is far less than advertised. It is very difficult to open the rear door. The instrument panel, particularly the radio controls, are poorly designed and difficult to use. While the turbo engine is very good and the ride is decent, the car is not what I have come to expect from Acura -- they should be ashamed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a jazzed up Honda at best. By no means does this truck have a true level of luxury, in fact, an Accord V6 may be more luxurious. That being said, it's all about performance in the RDX, and a fun factor that you will not find in any other smaller SUV. The RDX is the best driving small SUV out, it's faster, handles better, and has fantastic steering - new editions like the Q5 will give it a run, but its price keep it from being shopped together.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turbo that works - minimal to no lag, strong acceleration, sports car moves, SUV carrying capacity, great back seat - more room than what appears, sports car suspension (it's stiff - too stiff), SHAWD works.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just picked up my new RDX & I LOVE IT! I traded in my 10 yr old Saturn which I loved (low maint. & great reliability) but wanted an upgrade in quality (interior, features, etc). I do a lot of driving & the RDX has NOT disappointed so far. I read a LOT of reviews before buying & I have to say that the ride is a little rough but was expecting the "sporty drive" so I don't mind it. I have to respectfully disagree w/ complaints about the fuel economy. My 4-cyl Saturn ave. 30mpg, so I was prepared for a big bite into my fuel budget. Have put about 200miles on the RDX so far and I'm ave. 25mpg (60% hwy). Not bad! I don't dog it on the Turbo but it's a comfort knowing it's there if I need it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my RDX tech for around 32k + taxes. I think for the price, the feature content is great. I don't know why people think it rides harsh, I think the ride/handling balance is just right, sporty and confidence inspiring without being too harsh or floaty. The worst thing about this car is the omission of a couple cheap-but-nice features, and the fuel economy, which could have been better if they put the V6 under the hood. It's got more than enough power to deal with traffic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned the SUV for one year and 18k miles now. Fun to drive, good visibility, excellent handling and did real well in the New England winter. I am not a very aggressive driver and don't use the paddle shifters much. I do a mix of highway and city driving. I am averaging 21 mpg. The rear suspension is very firm which could be uncomfortable for rear adult passengers on longer trips. I owned another Acura five years ago. I was disappointed with the fit and finish of my SUV. Total of three trim pieces on the dashboard and passengers door panels were replaced under warranty because they became loose. Had to also take it back for rattling sound behind the glove box .</TEXT>

<TEXT>RDX is my first SUV. It has roomy interior and handles quite nice for its size. The ride quality is not for everyone since it is stiff sport suspension. It's supposed to be an entry level luxury SUV, but I don't really see that. Hope Acura pays little more attention to finish quality since interior rattle is really annoying.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My lease had come up on my 05 Infiniti FX35...a beautifully designed and performing vehicle. I looked at the BMW X3, the Infiniti FX35 and the Acura RDX. The obvious question was, what was I going to have to give up to move to a less expensive vehicle. Surprisingly... not much. Negatives on the RDX no automatic headlights strange... almost awkward styling, poor mileage, no compass, very basic rims, rough ride for some, strange cargo cover. Big Positves! Sports car handling and acceleration awesome, AWD system, look at it this way... if money wasn't an object, I'd be deciding between the BMW X6 or the FX50. Saving some money and not giving up the farm feels pretty good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased this vehicle yesterday and just wanted to say that my family and I enjoy every feature. Very quick in response off the line. Can barely feel the gears shift. Interior very well designed. Many fun options even with a base model. Why spend 4,000 more for a nav and a couple extra speakers? Handling is great. Gas mileage is to be expected from having a turbo installed. To anyone else complaining about this you should do your homework first. Besides wouldn't want to give your car the best of the best servicing? That's what makes cars last longer. Take this for what it's worth yet this car is a great small family vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD, turbo (great low end power), quiet, handles great. Not too big of a vehicle but not too small for a family. Lastly the hands free link is a blessing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my Acura for 2 months now and have close to 1,800 miles. I have had a rattle on the left hand side of the car since 65 miles. I am bringing it back to the dealer again next week. The cars mpg has never gotten over 16. It is the winter in WI. It handles well in the snow but not any better than my BMW 525XI was. The interior parts are very cheap. It is very bumpy in the city and drives like a jeep wrangler. I had better expectations from this car. It is not of a near luxury type of car. I lease it and have to drive it for another 34 months. I was recently in a Ford Escape that did not rattle like mine and had a quieter ride. Dealer apologizes but tells me I shouldn't expect much.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The radio is very good. The sound is excellent and clear. It is easy getting in and out of the car. The dash is also laid out clearly.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Came off of an A6 4.2 lease, wanted to downsize and have more fun, while allowing my middle-aged body to lift the children into the rear car seats without back break. High center of gravity concerns moot at anything up to 7/10ths driving (i.e. public roads) because of flat cornering and absorbing suspension. (Absorbing as in GTI, not Buick.) Also useful in deeper snow. It's not a sports car or sedan, but it's a a brilliant urban/suburban commuter, actually fun on a twisty parkway. Seats are surprisingly good. Tighter body structure on rough roads than an X3, no Audi suspension crash. No Audi interior, leather or BMW brakes or steering either, but not enough difference to justify $15K</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got my Acura RDX, overall I like the truck. 0-60 is great and mileage is decent. Build quality is excellent and the cabin is very quiet. However I am disappointed in the way it handles in snow - the car tends to lose rear end during turns in snow, especially if you take the turn fast. I was expecting esp would help but it does not. However in a straight line the truck is solid.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Originally we were set on a wagon to replace both a Pathfinder and a Saab sedan. However, when you look at what's out there in similar trim levels (new - Saab, Audi, BMW, Volvo) they get comparable gas mileage, with just a bit more room, but for 10K+ more. That made the RDX a no-brainer. Yes, it has a firm ride - it's on the sport side of SUV. It's much better than a truck-based SUV (such as my PF), and by giving up a Caddy-like ride, you're rewarded with actual road feedback and sharp handling. Yes, gas mpg isn't the best - but it also has a turbo that has zero lag with effortless acceleration, and is no worse than other crossovers. This car's not for someone wanting a boring town runabout.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Actual comfy seats that provide grip and hold you in; that sweet, sweet turbo; AWD; gigantic center console you could hide a small child in; OEM accessories that are useful and fit nicely (cargo liner, mats, guards); bluetooth and hands free phone; aux input; super lighting; and on and on.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my fourth Acura. The last being an MDX. While I realize this is an "entry level" SUV the quality and luxury of Acura has been scaled down on this vehicle. When my Lexus RX350 lease ended I didn't want to get the same car twice and the MDX has gotten to big with no more kids or large dog to haul around. There some features left off of this Acura which should be standard issue i.e. automatic headlights and power rear door, rain sensing wipers. The gas mileage is ridiculous. We celebrate when I can hold the average at 19 mpg for more than 10 minutes and that is with freeway driving. I will not purchase another RDX.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this vehicle for a litle over 2 months now. Just got back from a ski trip with the family. First, let me say the SHAWD is the best AWD system I have ever had. The vehicle handles snow like you are on asphalt! Mileage is all in how you drive - I am getting between 21 to 24 mpg combined with conservative driving. Beware that the suspension is stiff - trade-off the vehicles handles very nicely. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had this car for a few days, but I LOVE it! I have always loved Hondas and I have wanted AWD drive for years, so this is the perfect mix of fun and safety. The turbo and handling are impressive. It's like a sport sedan with higher clearance, AWD, and more trunk space.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turbo and AWD. This car truly has great handling. The turning radius is even better than it was in my 07 Accord. It has a very comfortable interior. The back seats fold completely flat, making the trunk area plenty roomy for my 70 lb growing puppy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased - compared to BMW x3 and Mazda C7. I just garaged my 600 hp track Vette, my Prius produced a distinct adrenaline deficiency. Looked at Subaru WRX, WRX STI for fun factor in winter but too small for family. The Acura is loaded with options, well built (solid), comfortable enough. Make no mistake this mini-SUV is a BLAST to drive. I am surprised they don't market this differently. Turbo 4 banger, SH-AWD Michelin Pilot rubber - snow is good! I can also fit kids, wife, dog, etc. Very happy with performance, technology is overdone - voice recognition nav system rivals BMW iDrive as far as frustration level</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performs like nothing else in its class. You can buy BMW x3 with sport package for $12k more - yes $12,000! and BMW is still slower in its responsiveness to changing road conditions. Turbo with paddle shift lets you truly optimize engine/turbo/tranny for a GREAT drive. Best price in class</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I?ve been on just about every type of terrain and this SUV has performed admirably. Highway and street ride and performance is great. Pickup is a little slow under 20 MPH but really winds up once the turbocharger is engaged. On the highway with the cruise set you can get 22-24 MPG at 75-80 MPG. Great pickup at high speeds for highway passing. In the city MPG is closer to 18. On the beach the all-wheel drive helps out and takes bumps and loose sand very well. Dirt roads are the same. I have not taken it on much worse than maintained dirt roads because of the somewhat low clearance and I bought it mostly as a highway vehicle. Almost every feature you need is included.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>One touch windows, audio quality, heated seats (not that I really need it), power driver seat, auxiliary audio input, huge center console, fitted rear cargo cover, turbo, xenon lights. Excellent/ though somewhat stiff ride on all terrains.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Let me say that I love Acuras because of the value you get with the car. No other car gives you the high-tech toys for such a reasonable price. All the toys work and make this a great car to drive. It is very quick and responsive and am getting 21 MPG. It is impossible for people to be getting 14 mpg unless they are goosing the car every chance they get. This is not a luxury sedan. What it is is a great 4WD SUV with luxury features and the best handling of any SUV I've driven. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Very disappointed, poor value for the price. Seats are uncomfortable (I'm 5'10", always hitting my thigh on steering wheel); nav system very complicated; voice recognition never accurate (say "go home" and nav responds with "air conditioner off"). Don't ever turn the car off with the steering wheel in anything but the straight position, if wheels are not straight, you will have problems turning the key in the ignition. Gas mileage is awful; acceleration certainly not 'peppy'; requires premium gas; oil changes require synthetic oil. Bought this car outright (not leased). After 2 months I am considering getting rid of this car and buying something more comfortable with better nav & mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is not my first Acura. These vehicles are designed to be a balance between value and luxury. Are they German engineered - NO. That said, they are good performers with great reliability. This is a fun vehicle to drive loaded with features that would be costly options on other brands. Fuel economy is based upon how aggressively you drive and the car is not going to magically transform into something else after to take it home - so give it a good test drive! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the car looking at the Mazda CX7, Nissan Murano, etc. Actually found that the RDX is only a bit more expensive then the Mazda so I went with it. The look and interior is awesome but its way to stiff. Every pothole makes the car jump, it feels like an old school jeep. I bought it for comfort and luxury, but this is way to jeep. It really gets annoying (even embarrassing sometimes. I really love the car otherwise but this is a major flaw.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having leased 2 MDXs over the past six years, I had no reason to look outside the Acura line to lease a new vehicle. I did, however want to economize on lease payments and no longer needed the additional space and seating of the MDX. The RDX really fills the bill. Super handling, great performance and real comfort for the driver and front seat passenger. The traditional Acura safety features and interior appointments are apparent. The voice activated tech package is awesome tho requires familiarity. This is just a feel good vehicle to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove the RDX 2x before deciding to buy and I sincerely regret it. There are just too many quirks in design that make this vehicle really annoying. The gas mileage has not improved with time, only getting 13 mpg. The audio constantly dimming ANYTIME you hit another button on the dash. The drive is similar to a BMW which is fine. The fact that you cannot import an address book with the handsfree is just stupid. Other Acura models have this feature, except RDX. For a few thousand dollars more get a BMW. Yes they nickel and dime you to death on options, but they make a great driving machine. Acura, in my book, has a long way to go. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have less than 1,000 miles on the car and averaged 22 mpg on the second tank of gasoline with both town and highway driving. The turbo comes on quick, if you need it. We like the stiff suspension and look forward to the AWD during our long Alaska winters. This is our third turbo car and they just keep getting better and better. Enjoying the memory power seats and mirrors with two drivers of different heights. With the easy to fold-down rear seats, it provides plenty of room for those shopping trips. We spent a year looking at various crossovers and the RDX always moved to the top of the list. We keep our cars 12+ years and look forward to a long term relationship. </TEXT>

<TEXT>First the RDX is NOT a luxury auto by any standards. The ride is so harsh that on a mildly bumpy road your head bounces off the restraint. On rough roads you had better hold the steering wheel very tight or you will get bounced off and lose control of the vehicle. I got over the lack of simple luxury items like seats that fold onto themselves and no power rear gate but the ride is something else. I am EXTREMELY sorry that I leased the '08 RDX. Acura has no clue that this is an issue as the response "well it is based on a truck" so I don't expect future models to address the ride.</TEXT>
