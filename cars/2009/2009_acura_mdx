<TEXT>I've had my car for a week, so I can't really comment on the reliability. I'll update it later. I originally went out looking to buy a Toyota Highlander, thinking that was the only SUV that was in my price range, but the deals on the MDX have been crazy so I could easily justify the $5 more I spent on the MDX. This car has everything I wanted. The SH-AWD is awesome, the luxurious interior is really comfortable and has a ton of features and tech (I got the tech package). The voice recognition is way better than my BMW I used to have and it drives much more like a sports car than the RX. I ordered all my accessories off of bernardi acura for way cheaper.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tech package is definitely worth it. Backup camera, Nav, plays Mp3 cds, XM, power rear door, aux input, really nice speakers, reclining rear seats, memory seats, flip key, voice recognition, bluetooth, phonebook import.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Our brand-new MDX was broken into and the window was destroyed and two DVD players on the headrest were cut and stolen after within one hour of purchase. We think the DVD headrest design was inferior, and can not be pulled out at all and no accessory to cover the two DVD sets. We think this is fail design and vulnerable to be stolen.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our first MDX in Dec 08. 5400 miles later, my wife was T-Boned on the drivers side at a major intersection. The front/side airbags deployed and there was some $20K in damage. I must say I was impressed to the way the vehicle took the direct hit, thus protecting my wife from any serious injury. The other vehicle was totaled. Based on the location, and speed of the vehicle that hit our MDX, this little thing really took it well. We got it fixed and bought another one. They may be pricey, but they sure are safe and dependable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 6000 miles this summer, I'm extremely pleased with our MDX. I really wanted a station wagon with a 3rd row seat and this was our best option. Great leg room for the kids in the second row and I've ridden in the 3rd row. Love the NAV. Easy to use. Bluetooth actually understands me! Love how stable and responsive the car is. Plenty of power when I need it on the highway. Tons of cargo space. Even with every seat in use, plenty of room for backpacks behind the 3rd row. Didn't want a minivan and I feel like we've finally found the perfect family car. I often take 300 mile+ trips by myself with the kids and I feel very safe in the car. I occasionally let my husband drive!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>NAV, Bluetooth, Driver's seat is very comfortable, legroom in second row, the SH-AWD makes for a very secure ride, 3rd row when I need it, tons of cargo space when I don't, easy to park in tight spaces. Getting 17mpg in city driving, 25-27mpg on the highway. Pretty good for 300 hp and AWD.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Acura and 6th Honda product and I love it. I live in Washington, DC and with almost 100% city driving I am getting 19.5 mpg overall. That is awesome city mileage for a full-size, comfortable 3 row SUV. It is comfortable, easy for the kids and very intuitive. The entertainment system can be "driven" 100% by the back seat passenger (in my case a 10 year old) which leaves me free to listen to satellite radio. Holds everything I need it to. One big feature for me, even with the 3rd row up there's enough room in the rear for kids school backpacks, some sports gear or groceries. The SH-AWD satisfies even my BMW loving husband who drives a 2009 535xi. He was pleasantly surprised.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Now over the initial new- vehicle "crush," I'm still very impressed with what this car is capable of. Lives up to the designation "luxury-performance SUV." I have subjected this vehicle to all kinds of conditions: towing a 4000 lb camper through 60-mile per hour gusts, plowing through white-outs on snow- covered roads in the Sierras, carrying three kayaks over dirt roads and sandy beaches. In all these adverse conditions, this vehicle kept its cool and did its job with grace, power, and control. It kept my family of five comfortable and safe with its arsenal of super-handling features. All of this, for a good $3000 below that of competitors with comparable features. You do the math.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Versatility, handling, and comfort. Hands down. Plus, 410-watt surround sound, plush leather in Sport package, NAV&BT, 300 hp, and XM radio.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got it a month ago after thorough study and many colleagues bought MDX previously. Overall it is a nice SUV and worth with its price. Good handling and smooth drive although steering wheel is too restrained to turn. For exterior I like front design, but tail looks terrible. Power is good, especially like the manumatic shift to satisfy sporty drivers. A typical sport SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2009 MDX is a good mix of luxury and performance. Interior styling is visually pleasant but Acura should not have skimped on quality of material such as the plastic interior handles and plastic fake wood. The strengths of the MDX is definitely the handling quality compared to other SUVs.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Driven my Sport/Ent MDX for 12000 miles now. The drive-ability of this SUV is impeccable. As in other reviews, I'm not sure it has 300HP, but it is enough. The smooth and quiet ride is why I bought it. Stereo is good, but not earth shattering. Nav is good, but has too many 'warning' prompts. Can program on the fly, unlike others. I really like driving at night and the headlights are great. Have had one problem with compliance bushings, but dealership is very accommodating with loaners. I don't like the key fob and think this league auto should have keyless options. Not sure about the transmission, which is designed to help you brake, is all that comfortable, but it is sporty and smooth.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a complete Acura fan. I have owned 3 Acura cars (all TLs) and now my great MDX. I fell in love with the MDX, its performance and reliability.. Feel safe and excited driving the MDX. However, for some reason, and for the first time, I've had several electrical issues. First, the CD player got stuck and it had to be replaced. Now, the electronics on the seats do not work, the memory is gone. The Bluetooth for my phone sometimes works but most of the time, I have to take my calls from the cell phone directly as the calls do not get through. After paying so much money for this MDX, it is disappointing to be having so many problems. Yes, Acura dealer will correct all these problems.</TEXT>

<FAVORITE>City and Highway handling, HID headlights are great, the Navigation System concept, rear back-up camera concept, pleasant look of the interior and exterior. The electronic features are first rate, but tend to be quite complicated and I am very technically oriented.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Generally I buy cars based on my trust in a company. I've owned a total of 6 Honda products (including Acura - TL), and all of them have been outstanding. This vehicle is a big disappointment!!! Where do I begin? I buy Honda products (and Japanese vehicles in general) for their bulletproof reliability, but I've had numerous problems with this MDX - been to dealer 6 times! Electrical issues, and a Transmission issue, and some others....and the power/acceleration is very mediocre (300hp?? Yeah, right!), and the ENGINE is VERY NOISY and unrefined when accelerating!!! Shocking for a luxury vehicle. Terrible leather! Sound system, Nav and handling are the only good attributes of this vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation system is simply the best, bar none. Handles like it's on rails. ELS/Panasonic sound system is possibly the best factory system around. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Nice car. Build quality is excellent. Dealer service has been excellent. Bluetooth cell phone pairing is easy and nice. Seats are hard for me to set up comfortably though and the headrests are absolutely awful. Very uncomfortable due b/c they tilt too far forward. Dash has too many buttons. Acura should consolidate the controls to make them easier to use, rather than trying to make you depend on voice input. GPS requires far too many steps. No iPod integration is disappointing. Needs better, more durable clear coat on the paint. Rear camera display hangs switching modes (dark to light) backing out of a driveway so often is useless when needed most on a sunny day.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Picked up this vehicle one month ago and so far logged 3200 miles without any problems. The vehicle runs great and is very comfortable for a guy who is 6'5" tall and 280lbs. I researched all AWD high end vehicles and went with the MDX. I had the car in for service at the dealership I purchased it and they were fantastic and extremely professional, so maybe Honda has listened and read all the consumer complaints. Last, I own a BMW X3 also... this SUV smokes the X3 in regards to service maintenance. A BMW oil change is 250.00 plus... a Acura oil change is 39.00 with a free car wash! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Love my MDX. Solid build quality and fit n finish. Did a apples to apples comparison with the Lexus RX 350. Hands down the MDX is much better value. The smoothness of the ride and the technology package is just incredible. My 2 kids(8 & 6) are having a ball. Bluetooth and phone book downloads are so convenient. The navigation system with lane assist, traffic updates and other advanced features like Zagat rocks! Xm is a nice icing on the cake..Can't stop looking at it and driving it. Plunge in and pamper yourself. You live only once..</TEXT>

<TEXT>Save your money folks -lot better stuff out there for the price. Have owned new MDX for about a year. Maintenance costs are VERY high. Differential fluid changes every 15,000 miles - not kidding. It's based on the service code. Dealers are all old school and in terrible condition. Have been to 3 different ones and they're all unprofessional -- and crooks to boot! Today I took the MDX in and apparently the brakes went out at 25000 miles. Fog/DTL light cover had melted from heat and they told me the exhaust from someone backing up real close must have done it -- unbelievable! Acura cust svc is just as bad. I have a Lexus too-the service experience and reliability is in a whole diff. league.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Honda tried to build a "luxury" brand -- they have failed miserably. Acuras are nothing but Hondas with the same poor dealership service but with higher maintenance cost!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I read these review before I buy so that's why I'm doing this. My first SUV, typically German sports cars. 11,000 miles no problems, gas mileage computer at 65 mph freeway 25-26 mpg, if I were to drive at 80 it would drop to 20-21, so I'm happy. Love sport suspension, in an emergency quick manuever suspension tightened up and I avoided an accident, fun too. Sequoia mtns. Snow was fun an safe handling, lots of power, remember im used to BMW's and Porsche's, no longer trust Mercedes. Surprised I enjoy the elec. Tail gate, love the taupe interior, nav screen big, blu tooth wonderful, computer info good, x-lights great cockpit comfort, luv the front grill etc. Looking to buy another in 2 years.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sport package, wheels are gorgeous, tires, suspension as must, body width, tinted windows. I added roof rails, looks naked without, added front and rear skid plates (silver) added a lot to looks.

<TEXT>Bought my MDX 4 months back. After 2 months transmission fluid started leaking, noticed oil marks on my garage floor. Took to dealer - they had to open the whole transmission and check inside. The problem was a faulty "O" ring which was causing the leak. If a $20 part is faulty after 400 miles not sure what to expect from this SUV. The dealer had to remove the whole transmission, unlink it with the engine, opened up everything connected to the engine to get to the faulty O ring. Don't buy this car, for this price there are much better options in the market. I have Lexus SUV as well and it far exceeds Acura from performance and reliability.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd MDX. Great vehicle, reliable, comfortable, quick and fun to drive. Dollar for dollar there is no better SUV on the market today. I have put about 100,000 miles on the 3 MDX's with few if any problems. My only real gripe is that the few problems I have had, have been dealt with poorly. The service departments of the Acura dealers are well below par, in fact they are poor. This is my 4th Acura in 7 years and as much as I love the vehicles, because of the quality of Acura's service, this will probably be my last. Honda get your act together you ain't no Lexus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Vehicle is daily driver for my wife and she seems to like the car but this is the roughest riding vehicle I have ever driven. All small bumps and holes in the road are felt in the steering and suspension. Make sure that you drive the vehicle on a long test drive on all conditions of pavement as this was the mistake that I made. Have tried running the vehicle with the bare min. air pressure in the tires but not much helps. Hopefully the suspension will loosen up with time as I try not to ride in or drive this car which is quite a let down.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I tried to convince myself to buy a German SUV. I test drove the X5 (3.0), Audi Q7, and the ML 350. In my opinion none of the German cars come close to touching the MDX in handling, comfort and space. Material could be a touch better in the MDX (the black fiberglass trim looks cheap for example). But there is no way I could justify 8-10K more for any of the German cars. And don't get me started on the RX350 or the CX9. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love driving my MDX. The base model has everything you really need, it includes a lot of upgrades that you pay for in other cars. The negatives: Low quality leather, it wears bad. The black plastic trim would be better replaced with wood trim, for a $40,000 vehicle that shouldn't even be a question. I notice a lot of road noise in the cabin. Also, I have the worst time getting my hands free link to recognize certain numbers. Sometimes I will have to say the number 4 like 5 times before it will actually dial the correct number. That is VERY frustrating. Also, for a $40,000 vehicle, it should have an automatic liftgate. This car does have excellent road handling, overall I am happy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Even though I loved the features of the MDX, I was originally not planning on getting a premium SUV and my preference was the Mazda CX9. I got to test drive both the vehicles in the snow on the same day. I was blown away by the MDX handling in the snow. Compared to the CX9, it was miles ahead. I bought it the same day and have not looked back. I love the features that come standard with the MDX. The SH-AWD system performs great in cornering and I don't have to worry about hitting patches of ice/water. The MDX slows down a bit more than you would expect when removing your leg off the accelerator, which took me a bit getting used to. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Upon owning my MDX for 2 months now, I am in some areas very impressed and in some areas let down a little. 15/20 is the advertised fuel economy. I have managed as much as 28 MPG cruising at 58 MPH on the interstate. I have a combined average of 19.8 since new. On a 2500 mile trip I got 23.0. Very impressive. Downs - black interior trim swirls and scratches like crazy. Leather seating looks like it's been sat in for 10 years already. It sags and has permanent indentions. I use Meguiars Leather cleaner/conditioner and it makes them look clean and shiny, but leather still looks worn beyond actual life. Car is strong as heck, does what I want it to, but seats and trim are questions. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy great if you take it easy. Use the cruise control as much as you can. It helps with uncontrolled acceleration. Any stretch over 5 miles I use it. If you drive aggressive or impatient, you'll struggle to get 18 on the highway. I did when I experimented with it. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>- Mazda CX9 was initially my #1 choice - After test driving CX9, I was disappointed with the driving experience (the ride is very shaky) - I tried the MDX, and was blown away by how it handled in the first 5 mins. The experience was silky smooth, yet at the same time aggressive, assertive and very sporty. - The SH AWD is amazing. During the test drive, the dealer encourage me to take sharp highway on-ramps at 60 mpg - I could feel the outer wheels "pushing" the car away from the turn - the feeling was totally exhilarating - I kiteboard - the adrenaline rush from the SH AWD (when used aggressively) is comparable to what I feel when on water - I would have never imagined that to be possible</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>- SH AWD - Plenty of space for our family of 4 - Superb material quality - Comfortable seats - Even my Base model has Bluetooth, moonroof, heated front seats, dual air, etc</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I researched this car for over 1 year before purchasing. While I test drove the BMW X5 (3.0) and the Audi Q7 I always came back to the MDX (Tech/ent). While the other SUVs offered some minor technologies not found in the MDX, those features would have satisfied less than 1% of my needs but when they were configured with all the features of the Tech/Ent MDX the competitors were $8k-$10k more. The performance of the car is really great and even when taking a bend at a high speed it seemed to handle the road better than my coupe. The exterior design is very nice and gives the SUV and aggressive look. My wife and I love the SUV but really miss the efficiency that we once had with a sedan</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling is better than expected. The interior is well designed and comfortable. Performance is better than expected but with a 300HP engine I should have anticipated it would have a better acceleration than some of the other SUVs I tested. The navigation system is one of the best and so is ELS</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is one of the best handling SUVs in the market in my opinion. I test drove several other usual suspects (Lexus RX, BMW X5 etc), and MDX has a nice combination of power, handling, convenience / luxury features at a very competitive price. When you think about the balance of power, handling, value, reliability, it is hard to beat this SUV. In 2006, Car and Driver did a comparison test and MDX came out on top. Also, if you are thinking about getting an MDX for the third row seat, note that the third row seat is best used for kids or smaller adults on a shorter trip as space is very limited. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Test drove everything over a three month period. Decided on the MDX because of its styling, handling, and technology. Nothing else in the segment came close. Now that I own it, I enjoy this vehicle far more than I ever imagined possible. I knew it was a great SUV, but the package in total, leaves you shaking your head at times. It is a precise vehicle, inside and out. Fit and finish is exceptional. Performance receives an A++ for a seven passenger vehicle, and it makes you want to drive the long way home everyday. The luxury, entertainment, and technology features lead you to believe you are already "home"! I recommend the Acura MDX Sports and Entertainment edition w/out hesitation!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've bought at least 10 cars over my life and always been 100% satisfied. For the first time I feel I made a huge mistake. I've got 1500 miles on a new MDX and I've decided to get rid of the damned thing. Engine noise reminds me of a 4 cylinder Camry, the transmission is jerky, particularly when downshifting - take your foot off the gas at 60 and the engine immediately starts dragging you down, almost like no overdrive. The front seats are exhausting if you sit in them over an hour. And the steering is way too stiff and the indentations on the wheel are spaced too far apart. I took at least 4 or 5 test drives and for the life of me I don't know how I missed these details.</TEXT>
