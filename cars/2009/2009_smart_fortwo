<TEXT>I originally bought a blue with silver tridian coupe back in July... had issues with water retention in rear hatch...was given a cabriolet smart loaner during repairs...fell in love with convertible...immediately upgraded to a red with a black tridian convertible because of 1.2% APR financing promotion, despite $3000 depreciation for trade-in . I have no regrets...LOVE the convertible. Read my other review for coupe, same applies to this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very flexible convertible--can open and close at any speed; closing convertible last minute before it rains therefore can use on days with rain in forecast! Love the tachometer & dash mounted clock, quirky but sporty. Very effective fog lamps, casts a wide area of illumination.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Let me be the first to sing praises of the BRABUS model. As a fairly fickle person when it comes to cars, I never had purchased the same make/model of car twice (let alone in a row). It all started with a very early delivery of my 2008 SMART Passion which I enjoyed for 20K miles plus. While debating to extend the warranty or trade to a different vehicle, I decided to take a BRABUS for a spin. The bigger rims, heated leather seats, the well sculpted body and the better suspension made it an easy decision and now my Black BRABUS hatch looks gorgeous in my driveway and it gets a lot of looks. For those who doubt the BRABUS magic need to test drive this car. Its a truly a SMART for the guys.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>- Improved and tighter suspension. - 'Special' BRABUS exterior treatment. - Surprisingly good upgraded sound system. - Heated Leather Seats (Standard) - The smirk on my face as I whip through traffic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is really good to show off how big it is inside. People I know can't believe how big it is and feels when it drives. The only thing I would change or add is Cruise control. I had it added, that makes it complete for me. I have nothing but fun when I drive it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded a Civic SI for this (hit a deer) and am thrilled with the experience. No it doesn't have the power of the Si or the handling, but it's a ton more fun to drive! Puts a smile on my face everytime I walk up to it. Love opening the top as I approach the car...such a warm welcome! I had navigation and bluetooth installed, except for cruise this is really loaded. Great little run about, even took a refrigerator to work in the back, fit perfectly. It's bigger than you think! Drove to NYC from MD, no issues and 45 mpg in the first 2000 miles. Looking forward to getting over 50 soon!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Red interior, top down and up at any speed, fits anywhere, shifting w/o a clutch, mileage...makes me smile even on my 50 mile commute and in traffic!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love, love, love my car! I average about 38 mpg over my 30 mile round- trip commute, and I've gotten 47 on the highway. I feel very safe (drove 80 mph this weekend). I have the upgraded stereo and it is great for me. I drive to work with a smile on my face every day. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, I have had many cars in my life and I can not think of any that is more fun to drive, including my wife's Z-4. It just cruises down the road at 70 to 80 with the big boys. My first tank of gas I averaged 37 MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very high on the cute factor. Really fun to drive with the top down. More interior room is more than expected for such a small car. Premium radio, not so much. Ditto with the A/C. I don't expect a CVT shift with a AM transmission, but Smartie has been in twice to the dealer in three months for very erratic auto shift patterns. Paddle/manual shifting works well. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Takes no room to park in garage,or anywhere. Top up/down at any speed. Several amenities, heated seats, auto rain wipers etc.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this car for my wife to drive locally, but I find myself driving it most, mostly because it's just FUN! For a great price, it's loaded with features found on higher-end autos such as rain-sensing wipers, heated leather seats, I take it on the highway as often as I drive locally, and it is surprisingly capable. Keeps up with traffic, responsive, good stability. I cruise at 75 mph and don't feel the speed at all. Seats are extremely comfortable. Driving locally, it is a bit sluggish to get going from a standstill, but once it's rolling it does OK. The shift changes in automatic mode are quite jerky. Manual mode allows for smoother shifting once you get the feel for it. Very good car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A/C blows very cold. Interior is very roomy, doesn't feel small when you're sitting inside. Get the comfort pkg. for $850, which includes P/S, auto headlights and wipers, and heated leather seats. it's really worth it. Lots more storage room in back than you would think, holds plenty.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I thoroughly researched before purchase. Agonized between the Suzuki SX4, Toyota Prius & the smart. The smart won in the end because of its uniqueness, "star power," and somewhat because it is a Mercedes. I was concerned about it's performance in the snow but felt reassured by a few other smart owners that it is effective getting around even in a blizzard with a foot of snow. I'll need to wait until winter to test its ability to climb grades in the snow. I'm sure the SX4 would have excelled in the snow but according to consumer reports only avg. satisfaction was achieved by Suzuki owners, whereas smart owners overwhelmingly loved their smart as do I. The Prius is just too expensive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Aux jack for iPod. Std radio surprisingly better than expectd, 2 speakers. I actually like the jerkiness while shifting because it reminds me that the car is a manual which I normally can't drive with a clutch. I like all its quirkiness which makes it unique. Ease of parking in the tiniest of spots.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This has become a love hate relationship. My wife and I are car lovers, we have a LARGER number ranging from the smart to several high performance sport cars. We live in a semi-rural area. Size doesn't matter. But I do like the nimbleness of our smart and ease of driving. The quirks of the car can get to you. Forget the gearbox, much has been written, but how about the rear hatch. What kind of a computer does it have that it take 10 seconds to release. Why is there no beep confirmation when locking and unlocking doors. Maintenance! I am a little of a do it yourselfer....go check the water in the battery. It's a joke. Many in dealer stock. Bloom is off</TEXT>

<TEXT>Excellent car. Impressive engineering, e. G., abs, electronic stability control, corner braking control, tridion safety cell, etc. Outstanding ergonomics, e. G., comfortable seats w/adjustments, excellent visibility, very fun to drive. Handles very well, and power is sufficient to easily keep up with highway traffic. A manual transmission w/o a clutch, the smart shifts best when you do it yourself, either with paddle shifters or the floor mounted shift lever. In d, the shift points seek the most economical shift point v. More torque, etc. Thus, the engine can lug, e. G., too low rpm. Amazing amount of passenger room, and cargo room in the rear is fine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is not a sports sedan. It is a small, efficient urban two passenger transport that has a small footprint but a spacious interior. Being a Daimler product it has the safety and quality expected. Having a small Mitsubishi engine, it is no surprise the performance and reliability it has. Being a European design, it has character and head turning style. Over all this little car has fulfilled and surpassed every design objective and it is fun to drive around town. It is priced well for the market.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven the car 80 miles each day and I love it. I drive in auto mode most days and average 39 MPG. I have driven it almost 5000 miles in 2- 1/2 months. There have been no problems or glitches at all. I am a big guy and I have plenty of interior room. I love the auto wipers and the safety in such a small car. Cold air and good heater. Great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had to laugh at the disparity between expert reviews and consumer reviews. Also at the comment "unsuitable for highway use." Ask the semi drivers on IH-20 how "unsuitable" it is. As they pass, they check their rear view mirror to see how their vortex has affected the smart. They have to be amazed by the stability. Drivers are also surprised that the smart can be issued a ticket for speeding. lol Is the smart easy to drive? Not at first, but with practice it becomes an extension of the driver, and is a pure joy. Jaws gape at the tight u-turns and how easy it is to park in lot spaces approached from the wrong direction. As the reviews show, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety cage. Smarts in collisions routinely save their drivers' lives and limit injuries. Maneuverability. Gas mileage. Amazing interior room. Cargo capacity. Stability in adverse conditions.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> Month and 7k miles, I love this car, it is my favorite. The car is easy to maneuver, great to park. I like driving it in manual mode, where I can control the shifting and make it smoother. It is good on auto but I prefer the manual specially since there is no clutch. The transmission does adapt to your driving style, specially during the break in period.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love my Panorama Roof and heated seats. Plenty of room, great car for the money. Very nice interior design and materials (I have leather seats). Love the mute bottom on the Radio, I don't have to turn my radio off or mess with the volume to answer a call!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It drives like a jeep (hard and stiff) and is slow to accelerate. The brake pedal is uncomfortable. I use it to go to work where parking is an issue. This is the only reason I bought the car. In this respect it's great. I now compete with motorcycles. But in all other respects it is disappointing. Transmission is slow to shift, a/c not cold enough. Would I buy it again? Yes. Because of the parking issue I have no choice. If I didn't have to go to work and park I would not buy this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have more fun in this car then in any I have owned. It's responsive, comfortable and a joy. It is amazing to me how something that is so small can feel so big when you're in it. The transmission takes a bit to get used to, but as soon as you do, it works great. If you're looking for a race car, this ain't it, but if you want something to get you where you're going with a smile I'd say you don't have to look further. :-)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently bought my Smart car from a dealer instead of ordering online. I really enjoy it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>There is plenty of interior room and I enjoy the extras, like automatic wipers and lights. The automated manual transmission is good for me because I am used to a manual transmission and often switch to the manual mode for better control and speed. I love not having to deal with a clutch though.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is fun and versatile to drive. You can drive it in the automated (transmission) or the manual mode. It drives much better in the manual mode and you have more control over the acceleration level and shifting into gears. You can?t compare this car to a traditional sedan, which is what many reviewers try to do. This car is in a league by itself. There is plenty of room for 2 average size people and it makes getting around and parking in an urban area much easier than any other car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is so small on the outside yet roomy on the inside. Took delivery and drove 120 miles that day on US 101. The car handles very well at freeway speeds with minimal wind buffeting despite weighing 1800lbs. I have 160miles on it and have used about 4 gallons. Storage room is ample, but I would recommend the optional luggage area divider to keep items from coming forward during braking. Shifting is sluggish for an automatic but if you think of it as a manual without a clutch it seems fine. After driving a V8 Mustang for years the car accerlates slowly but it keeps up with freeway traffic without difficulty. Other reviews said the car was noisy, but I didn't notice any excess noise.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The leather seats are very comfortable and the interior is roomy. The car turns on a dime and is very easy to park. Quick responsive steering and a solid feel from the suspension. Smart has used all of the space available nicely.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Old people have discovered this car, so it is not sold to youngsters only...People ask me if it gets 60 miles per gallon, and I respond it gets the best gas mileage of any non-hybrid sold in America...You can do a u-turn on a narrow 2 lane street,but don't try going fast over speed bumps...The Passion is loaded with standard equipment, including panorama roof,paddle shifters,auto air,electric windows/locks,and ABS/ stability control... The Smart is Amazingly roomy for two...It has enough space in back for a week's groceries...It has style,which is lacking in other economy cars... It is a Mercedes on a beer budget...Resale value will likely challenge Corvette and most Japanese imports...</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy,comfort, and style...Old folks enter and exit without any of the contortions required by other small cars...You can leave the transmission on auto or use the paddle shifters as desired...The transmission is designed to eliminate any slippage,which has drawn some misguided criticism..</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 81 yr. old Mom & I bought this used with only 50 miles, so it was basically new. Original owner lived in the city & bought it for his 17 yr. old. After only a few weeks, she didn't feel safe driving it. We feel very safe. We live in a Rural area, & have driven on the Interstates. We LOVE it! As others have said, get use to having people wait outside in the parking lot to see who's driving it & asking questions. The first time driving, Mom got 2 thumbs up from guys working on the road. The automanual shifting is indeed there with the jerking motion, but after driving for awhile now, we hardly notice it anymore. Can't wait to put the top down. Love the heated seats. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We wanted something that would fit in Mom's garage. No problem, of course. She also had knee surgery & needed something easy to get out of. Again, no problem as doors open wide & seat is perfect height. Love the color blue! Very roomy inside and you don't feel like you're in a small car at all.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is amazing, it is fun to drive. I feel very safe when I am in this car, also the acceleration is better than you think. The quality for a car of this price is EXCELLENT, it feels rock solid and has go-kart-like steering. I can do 60mph and turn hard, feels like BMW designed the steering. This car is put together well for it's price it does not feel cheap at all. It does not roll or tilt when driven hard, makes me feel good and excited to drive this baby!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The is the first car I've ever truly loved. I had six requirements in buying a car, all of which were satisfied by this car: 1)buy new at less than 12 K, 2)increase in value rather than depreciate, 3)five star safety rating (and I saw the video of them smashing a smartcar into a brick wall at 70mph with virtually no damage to passenger compartment, 4)plenty of room on inside, especially head toom, 5) lots of pep, 6)good in snow, 7) good at high speed, 8)incredibly fun to drive. 9) I have averageed 41 mpg since purchase. Now, why can't we build a car like this in the U.S. so I can buy American? </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just picked up my Cabriolet, after waiting a year. I love my new car, it is definitely a head turner, I have named her LadyBug, she is red with the black tridion. It is very comfortable and roomy in the inside, it keeps up with traffic on the highway, 65-70 feels pretty safe. I have not driven her in the snow yet, this will take some getting used to. Although I use the automatic driving option, you can feel the shifting, almost like a racing car. Can't wait for the good weather, so that her top can come off. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The size, the build, it feels very sturdy and safe, love the new red color for this year, the ease of the top coming down, it can be done while driving. the fact that you can replace the panels, very inexpensively, and have a new looking car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It is about time the USA received the smart. Here are some things you should know though-the ride is bouncy at times and firm, the fuel economy isn't as good as you think, in most places you cant park it nose-in into spaces,& the acceleration isnt good. But there are alot of positives- driving it is as fun as driving a gokart, it is spacious on the inside, it feels fine at 70mph on the freeway,& the you feel that the whole world is looking at you. Everywhere I go, I get asked questions like "Is it safe?", or "Is that streetlegal?" but you get used to the attention. It is an eyecatcher and welcomed in the city, in the country, and it feels right everywhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We had to wait a very long year after placing our reservation for our smart - her name is Daphne. The only way you know you're driving a tiny car is when you get ready to park it. It has wonderful pep; great head-turning quotient - makes everybody smile; and is such fun to drive. We got caught in a heavy snow squall about a week ago and in no time we were driving in a couple of inches of snow (no snow tires) on curvy, hilly country roads. The car performed beautifully. We have ordered the aftermarket exhaust system and are considering replacing the red body panels with yellow ones. Guess we could sell the red ones on eBay.</TEXT>
