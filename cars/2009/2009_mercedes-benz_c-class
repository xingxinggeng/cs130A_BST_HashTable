<TEXT>Drove the CTS-V before the C63 AMG. Got such a great deal, never bothered to drive the M3. CTS-V was a boat compared to the C63. Such great responsiveness and a feeling of complete control with the AMG. A friend of mine put it perfectly: This car feels like you are driving a go cart. Hard to pass somebody without getting close to 100. So much faster than my Lexus GS 430. Can't wait to fire it up to hear the great exhaust sound. Sounds more like a lamborghini. Also like the fact that it is a sports car with four doors so can put the kids or cargo in the back. Would definitely buy this car again without hesitation! Simply AWESOME!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd C class Mercedes, following a 2001 C240 and a 2005 C230 Kompressor, and is easily the best of the lot. It is faster than any of my previous ones, more luxurious and far better built. The only area where it fails to live up, at least to my 2005, is in its aggression-factor. The 2005 C230 Sport was simply a far more aggressive car, with much stiffer springs, deeper and firmer bolstering on the seats and a loud and sporty exhaust. Of course, the new car is far more luxurious and still adequately sporty. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>C6 Z06 to C63 AMG</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Traded my 08 C6 Z06for a 09 C63 AMG. This car looks great, handles well,is fast and the engine sounds terrific. Gas mileage is simply pathetic, the worst car I ever had in gas mileage, I am only guessing a Hummer or a Ford Excursion are worst on gas. You must get the P2 package, definitely you wouldn't need the performance package. The seats are the best I ever seen, better than my Evo IX Recaros. Be aware that the maintenance can be expensive but overall you are getting a top notch quality car. Insurance is OK,not too bad. Again, whenever you plan buying this car makes sure you put aside a good solid $300 for monthly gas expenses. Red and black colors don't have $720 penalty. Good luck!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a nice car. It looks good and handles great. Good power and a smooth transmission. The interior of this car is laid out well, but it is too small. Disappointed in the size and space in the rear seats. Trunk is too small as well. I wish I would have purchased the Audi A5 or A6, maybe a BMW 330 for a little more interior room and about the same price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my Audi S8 for this car. My wife thought I was crazy until she drove it. It handles like it is on rails and the performance is very good overall. Not quite the acceleration of the Audi but I am getting 31 mpg on the highway between 65-70mph with the cruise set. I can't wait for the Borla exhaust to come!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first car and it is stunning! The power is great the ride and handling is awesome. The build quality so far is superior we will see how that holds up in a year or so. The dealer gave us an excellent bargin and the service was spectacular. The transmission is so smooth. The interior is great nice restrained use of over the top materials it is a very nice balance of luxury and sport but..for my taste could be a little more luxurious. fuel economy is good . just filled it up and took a road trip averaged 31.2 MGP!!!!!!!! worst was 21.3 mpg and average with mostly city driving and occasional highway driving i get between 24-25 mpg overall and very well done and highly recommend it ! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd MB. I have the sport package, Auto with the multimedia option. Amazing sound system and overall a very fun car to drive. By far has been my favorite car I've ever owned. For the money, the C class provides everything I could imagine. The car feels and looks much more expensive than it is. In my opinion the body style is more appealing than any 60K dollar car I've seen on the road. It's eye catching, I get tons of compliments and is a true joy to drive to work and back everyday. I'm amazed at some of the other reviews I've read bashing this car. I can't find one thing I "hate" about this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was originally reluctant to purchase a MB due to what I had heard regarding quality issues in the past. I must say that so far this car has been perfect, no issues whatsoever, great build quality with no rattles or squeaks. I did have to replace the OEM tires after 4200 miles due to wear, but other then that the car has performed better then I expected. The car is FAST but also drives well on the highway for normal cruising. The electronic package is top notch as well. The HK stereo is great sounding, the navigation is clear to understand, and the voice recognition is far better then what my Acura has. Overall I would buy this car again with no hesitation.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just turned in my 2007 Acura TL. I loved that car, it had great styling, performance, and gas mileage (in the last two regards, it still beats my new Benz). But as far as refinement is concerned it's not even close, the MB blows away the Acura. I test-drove a TSX and couldn't believe how much cheaper it felt than the Benz (despite the difference in price, my best Benz lease deal is only $14 more per month than my best TSX offer). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very refined driving experience; excellent ride, noise suppression, solid-feeling car. Great styling. Very reasonably priced. Base stereo sounds great (plays mp3s); didn't need GPS, saw no need to go with expensive multimedia package.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2007 Lexus IS350 as I was getting bored with the car (lol). I love the IS350, but wanted a change. I like the more aggressive look of the C350 as compared to my Lexus, and that was the main draw as I knew I'd be giving up a bit in terms of comfort (Lexus has much softer leather and seats, and somewhat smoother ride) and horsepower (IS350 306hp v. C350 268hp). The C350 offers a more engaging driving experience (falls between the IS350 and 3-Series). My Lexus was overly smooth which took the "sport" out of sport sedan. Despite 38hp less in the C350, it's more fun to drive than the Lexus and acceleration is more than adequate to get ahead of traffic.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system is excellent (much more bass and 150 more watts than Lexus Mark Levinson), navigation, fit and finish, styling, handling, ride comfort. Despite complaints about rear seat legroom and trunk space, it has more than the IS350, and I can now fit average size adults in the back seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a terrific car which is priced right. It has beautiful outside styling and inside looks like a high- end luxury sedan. Roomy and comfortable front seats. The car is a lot of fun to drive with responsive handling and a quiet ride. Will use any excuse to drive, even running errands! I have it with Premium Package and Ipod which works well. Recommend the multimedia package in hindsight though I did not get it. Anyone looking for a sporty, luxury sedan at a fair price should consider this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After the first 1000 miles the car is amazing. Gas Mileage has been good, not great but better then average from other posts i have read. Though hp could be more, that is not the mind set i had for this purchase if i was only concerned with hp the bmw or infinity would do, I wanted smooth ride, luxury feeling, solid build construction, and of course an amazing looking body style inside and out. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Let me just say I'm not easy to please, ask my spouse, BUT this car is a DREAM. I had a MB in 2002 all kinds of problems, swore them off. After 2 disappointing BMWs and 9 months of car shopping, decided to drive into MB dealership and check out what was new. Fell in LOVE with the C class but wanted more power. The salesman suggested C 63. Once I drove it, that was the end, it was mine. Loving the 450 hp and the "kick" when you gun the engine to get around a slow poker. I wake at 5 am just to go out in my garage and have a look. AWESOME car, I couldn't be happier.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Much improved in every way over my '04 C-240AWD. Beautifully and solidly put together like any M-B should. Smooth power but no hot rod, Though not striking, stylish and functional interior. Sport model has nice balance between ride/comfort and sporty handling. The C-Class is not dazzling in any one area but the sum of the parts equals one fine, substantial all around car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Last Mercedes was a 1986e. Awful. Switched to Saabs and then two Bmw 5's and finally a Bmw 330x. Cabin too small on the Bmw 3 and the run flat tires are awful. The C300 Sport 4 matic,( don't laugh,) performs like the 5 series only more nimble. Plenty of power and stability. Interior is a little austere and the trunk is just too small. Close call over the Audi 4 but on balance a more solid feel without those silly led headlights.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second review after 10 months and 10,800 miles. Please, see the very first review in the series. I am overall very happy with the car. The ride is solid, well controlled, and the steering is light, which I personally like. Surprised to read others' horror stories about gas consumption as I get 17-18 mpg in the city and 28-30 on the highway at 65 mpg. The manual shifter is not the slickest on the market (Acura TSX is better, I tried), but pretty short throw and works without failure. The car isn't super fast from the start, but enough power for me (after all it's 228 hp, not 300 like some others). Like how quiet the car is. The electronics are great (got P2 package).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I don't think you are going to believe what my wife and I just experienced this afternoon: Just bought a brand-new C300 from Smythe Europeans about 5 hours ago. Very nice, short experience with the sales manager: Nice guy, very good deal. We got home, noticed that a bigger chunk of rubber was sticking out in the corner of the driver's door. Also inside, a little piece of carpet between passenger's seat and the middle was missing. We drove back "Sorry, can't do anything, you need to come back on Monday." 2nd time coming home, the long rubber piece below the driver's door CAME OFF - literally! Can you believe it? Nice design, but my wife can't even enjoy the first day with her new car now...</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's a performance car only for people who have never owned a performance car. Everything is an option and you feel like you're getting nickled and dimed. Mercedes quality has been below average for a long time (hence no purchase) but maybe now it's getting better. Got this car at a good price so I bought it. Hope I don't regret it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We just purchased recently but so far are really impressed with the car. The style is a head turner and the interior is awesome..the high tech. advancements are very high end. It drives like a little sports/race car while has much more room inside than expected, especially with the fold down rear seats. Huge advancements over prior models and it really feels and looks like a MB should!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned many M-B's since 1984. This is a very nice car, but after a month, I wish I'd gotten the C350. I also have an '06 Porsche Carerra S Cab and just turned in an '07 E350. It has P1,P2,Nav,18's and Panoramic Roof. All that stuff works great, but the seats are not as comfortable as my E350 was. My two major gripes are the brakes and power. I do 70% freeway driving and at 65 mph, this motor has limited passing ability. Punch it and it makes a lot of noise, but takes an hour to get around a big rig, especially on an uphill grade. I guess it depends on what you're used to. Additionally, the car is 'underbraked'. You really feel the brakes straining to bring the car down when needed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The voice activated NAV works great. So does the Bluetooth, but it won't import my phone book like my 2007 E did. Car has less body roll than my E Class did...that's a plus!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Mercedes and I absolutely love it! I bought a 2008 model with package 2, and enjoy every day of driving it. Very beautiful, people always look at it. Good gas mileage, excellent handling, very smooth and quiet ride, excellent breaking: stops immediately with hardly any noticeable impact. Excellent suspension offers comfort or sport ride options. Powerful V6 engine, traction control and 4matic all wheel drive helps to handle the car very well on the slippery roads and snow. Has lots of neat features inside and out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove Audi A4 and Lexus I250. Both are great cars, but they did not catch my soul. As soon as I saw C300 Sport in the deader, I "fell in love." Excellent exterior design! The ride in C300 is very comfortable and solid. When I drive it in the hard rain, it is unbelievably stable. I feel more secured and protected inside C300 while driving than IS250 and A4. The gas pedal is stiff, but once I step on, the car runs fast. Gas mileage is about 20-21 in local traffic and 25-26 in highway. Not so bad in V6. The package includes Premimum 2, Ipod connection, automatic transmission.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior design. This is the main reason I bought C300. Aggressive front face and dual exhausts in rear face.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The C350 shows sporty yet classic MB styling, is well crafted, has excellent power and torque, and is incredibly fun to drive. The navigation and upgraded sound systems are well worth buying, especially for gadget & toy fanatics. Voice command control is a fantastic addition to this car. Handling, acceleration are well-balanced with a smooth, quiet ride. The sport tires are slightly louder than touring tires, but it's well worth the price of driving a sport-tuned suspension. Overall, the car compares very favorably with BMW 335i, but likely cost close to $5,000 less than comparably equipped models.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first luxury car. My previous car was a 2007 Toyota Camry which served its purpose for a while but was incredibly boring and slow. After a few months of research I was between the C300 and the Infiniti G35/37. The G37 is an exceptional car, and definitely more performance-oriented than the Mercedes, but there was something just too similar to Nissan/Toyota about it that turned me off. I went with the C300 and am very happy with it. I decided to opt for the multimedia, p1 and ipod connector, while I was considering the p2 package for the xenons and fold-down rear seats it just did not warrant the added cost. Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase and have no complaints.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage is excellent for a V6. About 23 mpg overall mostly stop-and-go Florida traffic.

<TEXT>I was looking at this car and the BMW 3 series and Plaza also has BMW. My family all liked the C300 better after test driving both (although, the 3 series was an auto and the Merc was 6 speed). So far the car is great, very smooth, enough power and room. I also test drove the Passat CC and felt that you had sunk into the car and it was hard to see out of it. The good thing about this car is that I didn't order any fancy electronic doo-dads and the only options on it are the ipod connector and wood dash trim.

<TEXT>I initially looked at the Mercedes because it is one of the few 6 cyl cars that are available in a manual transmission. I test drove the 328i sedan on the same day as the 300. My whole family liked the c 300 better for the ride and the sitting position/comfort. The 328 was an auto. It seemed like the engine of the 328 was straining and a bit noisier than the 300. Also, it was difficult to get a 328i without a bunch of add- ons. Same with the Infinity G-37 MT. It was difficult to find without so many options. The only options on my 300 are the burl walnut dash trim and the ipod adapter. So the list on my car was around $34,000. </TEXT>

<TEXT>A follow-up review 3 and 1/2 months down the road. Love the car. No disappointments at all! Really happy about the performance, ride comfort, and the looks. Gas mileage is quite appropriate (get as bad as 17 mpg in the city high traffic and as great as 28 mpg on the highway). Really great combination of solid feel and ride and yet the car feels quite light. The COMAND system is outstanding. Pick up from the 1st gear is a bit sluggish, but, again, never expected it to beat more powerful BMW 3 or Infinity G35, for example. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I picked my C350W at the Sindelfingen factory as part of the European Delivery Alps/Black Forest rally trip. The level of comfort, quiet, and road performance is simply outstanding. As an engineer I really appreciate all of the hidden details and overall sophistication in the design features. I have driven stretches of autobahn at 110 MPH and the car is serenely quiet and rock solid at this speed. This is combined with strong brakes, effortless tracking on winding country roads, and unexpectdly good mileage on this trip 24.9 MPG overall. Firm seating comfortable for long stretches, awesome HK Logic 7 sound system, smart HID lights, and great instrumentation and controls. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I purchased a 2009 C300 this past May at a local dealership. We got employee pricing via a friend who works there. We read a lot of great reviews and some bad reviews and found both sides to be true. The car drives smooth and quietly on highways and backroads but is boring to drive. The suspension is soft but contolled. The engine is smooth but drinks gas like an SUV. It is also not that powerful for a $46k luxury car. The exterior look is what got us to consider it but the interior plastics are very low quality. Steering is a bit disconnected. The brakes feel squishy after long high speed stops. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned many cars over my lifetime and I have not had a car as quality crafted, as well thought out, as sensuously feeling and as nice looking as this new C300 model. I owned an S500 in 2000 and a Porsche Cayenne, so I am used to quality cars. This car is better. It's quiet (big deal to me) and it's fast enough. It's not as fast as others in this price range, but it's not a high priority to have super fast pick-up. The electronics are the best I have seen and I shopped for a year. My small list of complaints is that it doesn't have a place for sunglasses and the iPod contents are visible on the dash screen, not on the console screen, it should be. Test drive this car, fantastic!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The stereo is amazing, it brakes better and has far more traction than my other 4 wheel drive cars. The seats are comfortable yet firm, the controls are in the perfect places. The engine is quiet and road noise control is excellent. The quality of the materials are very high.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Car seems to have much more HP than advertised. Engine lot of torque at low RPM, transmission always find best gear. It's a great car for normal driving, it's only when you floor it that you realize it has only 220hp. Very solid chassis, good handling, nice ride. Interior is very high quality. Lumbar adjustment and center console opener bit hard to reach. 09 has pelvic airbags, memory seats, power adjust. steering wheel, but no power fold in mirrors. Tech. in car is very advanced and very easy to use. Stereo is excellent. Ipod works great. Navi will give street names in center of speedometer. voice contrl.Front end low, easy to scrape. Car needs very little maintenance, interval is 10k.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The way it drives and downshifts right when you want it to. On highway 85MPH is smooth. The handling. The ease of use of the navi, phone, and stereo. The pop-up screen. The way it looks. People stare at this car. From the front it looks great. MPG better than advertised. Takes E85. Very safe car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have a C300 Luxury 4 Matic, Premium 1 & Multimedia packages, IPod Integration Kit. I have test driven Lexus ES and BMW 3 series sedan and found that this car is by far more enjoyable to drive. The C300 Luxury sedan easily wins in value and prestige for the money. 2009 model has 40GB hard drive and 3 memory settings for the driver seat, which includes the power wheel, and mirrors settings. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Multimedia package is great in all aspects.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>2009 Mercedes-Benz C-Class C300 Sport Sedan has met all of my expectations for a sport sedan. The performance and look of this car is terrific. I have a C300 Sport with the 6 speed manual transmission, Premium 1 & Multimedia packages, IPod Integration Kit, and the 18? AMG wheels. I have driven many cars of different make, model and price range. The C300 Sport Sedan easily wins in value and prestige for the money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Got the Mercedes after having being a happy driver of two Honda Accords since 1994. Then carefully planned a new purchase after having tried many similar size, entry level, luxury sedans, both German and Japanese. Went for the Mercedes for its optimal combination of smooth ride quality, plenty of power (last Honda was around 140 hp), quality built, and of course the looks. Mine came manual (still love the thrill of shifting gears), with all the "high end packages", so came to about 42,000 $, pretty similar to other cars in that category. So far driven it for a week, with a good combo of city and highway mileage, and love it. And any manual car only gets better with time! </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I purchased a 2009 C300 this past May at a local dealership. We got employee pricing via a friend who works there. We read a lot of great reviews and some bad reviews and found both sides to be true. The car drives smooth and quietly on highways and backroads but is boring to drive. The suspension is soft but contolled. The engine is smooth but drinks gas like an SUV. It is also not that powerful for a $46k luxury car. The exterior look is what got us to consider it but the interior plastics are very low quality. Steering is a bit disconnected. The brakes feel squishy after long high speed stops. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior design. Glass roof is unique. Decent trunk size. Good front seat comfort and leg room. Good A/C. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned many cars over my lifetime and I have not had a car as quality crafted, as well thought out, as sensuously feeling and as nice looking as this new C300 model. I owned an S500 in 2000 and a Porsche Cayenne, so I am used to quality cars. This car is better. It's quiet (big deal to me) and it's fast enough. It's not as fast as others in this price range, but it's not a high priority to have super fast pick-up. The electronics are the best I have seen and I shopped for a year. My small list of complaints is that it doesn't have a place for sunglasses and the iPod contents are visible on the dash screen, not on the console screen, it should be. Test drive this car, fantastic!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The stereo is amazing, it brakes better and has far more traction than my other 4 wheel drive cars. The seats are comfortable yet firm, the controls are in the perfect places. The engine is quiet and road noise control is excellent. The quality of the materials are very high.</FAVORITE>
