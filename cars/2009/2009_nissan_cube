<TEXT>I have spent months reviewing cars like Mercedes, Cadillac, Element, Prius. Saw the Cube one day on the road. Decided to investigate. My significant other could not understand what I saw in this little car. I was concerned that the transition of going from a Mercedes that I have driven for the past 10 years to this little car might be a challange. But with everything so serious these days I decided it was time to have some fun. Be different. It is a great little car. So comfortable inside. The ride is smooth. It handles well. I get 32 mpg. It may not be as quite as my Mercedes but it is fine. It is so roomy inside. Even my SO loves it. We call her the "Happy" car. We are having fun</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth, comfy seats, her curves, MPG. All the space.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The day after I got my new Cube, I drove it and noticed the acceleration was not smooth and engine is loud. I got a bad feeling about this new car of mine. This engine is not consistent, it drives normal and sometimes loud engine with lesser power during acceleration as if engine is struggling. I brought it to the dealership but they said it is in normal condition, just try to observe it. Mileage now is only 1,450.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well I purchased my Cube with the help of the Clunkers program as well as with the help from a local TX clunkers program. Great discount. I love my cube. Spacious, Fun to drive, economic, great turning radius too. Even though it is 100x better then the 95 Jimmy I threw away, ( God awful vehicle) the interior design could be better. Cup holders are too close to the gear shift, glove compartment opens right into passengers legs.If you want to slide forward/move the seat up, your arm barely fits, have to open the door. Even though these things are a little annoying, The Cube,in my opinion, is a great buy. Nothing else on the road looks and feels like the Cube.Fun to drive.6,200 mi. in 2 mo.=D</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Outside look, roominess, turning radius, gas mileage, shag carpeting for holding my shades and phone. Radio is actually pretty good in sound quality.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My husband and I looked at a lot of cars including the Kia Soul and Scion XB. I am 5'10" and he is 6'3" so it is very difficult to find a vehicle that is comfortable. Wanted good gas mileage, head room and off the ground. The first reaction to the CUBE was "that is one "UGLY" car. We took one for a test drive and my Husband said that was the happiest he had seen me test driving any car. I love this car! People actually turn around while driving to look at it. Makes me laugh every time! The gas mileage has not been consistent, it ranges from 29-34. But that is still not bad. What wind noise. I LUV this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable, handles and rides great and - hour commute each way. love the room, comfort, blue tooth.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the best car I have ever owned. I have had it for a few months and still have not found a single thing I dislike. I test drove nearly every vehicle in this class and am confident I made the right choice. The car is well built and designed extremely well. Everything has a very solid feel to it and reminds me more of driving my mom's lexus than any of my friend's cars. Drive this one after driving the Kia Soul or the Scion xB and you will never look back. The cube will offer you smooth pickup (the CVT is awesome!), great handling and suspension, and luxury at a fairly low price. I know I sound like an ad ... just go drive one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the intelligent key. If you are a woman you will love it too! Throw the keys in your purse and you never have to dig them out!! Just have the "key" in your purse, walk up to the car and push a button on the door handle to unlock or lock it. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my X-terra for the Cube. Have always liked the Nissan Quality, I fell in love with the look and was shocked at how big the interior was. I do not like the feel of driving a sedan which is why I had the X-terra (second one I have owned by the way. The car has the feel of a much bigger car and Love the look. The first day I drove to work there was a crowd checking out my new ride, Gas bill is now cut in half. Best car this 47 year old professional has ever owned. Take a walk on the freaky side, buy a cube now!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Since I was replacing an old small pickup I wanted something with space that wasn't an SUV and it had to be comfortable. The cube is EXACTLY what I wanted. I used the cash for clunkers program so I had to go with the CVT but it works wonderfully, better than any auto could dream of. It did take some getting used to but the smoothness it returns is worth it. You don't climb into a cube, you sort of slide into it. The low flat floor and wide doors make ingress/egress drama free, even for grandparents and our greyhound. I can't say there's really anything wrong with the car, a few niggles maybe but that's it. The price tag might hint at "budget car" but the car itself screams "DRIVE ME!"</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT and the 1.8; smooth, quiet and good mpg's. The sliding/reclining rear seat is a nice touch and I love never hitting my head on a top opening hatch. The seats are fantastic, and the overall interior is spacious and very inviting. I guess my favorite feature is the whole car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At 60 years old I've owned and driven many new cars. Driving the cube is like sitting in a chair at home looking out a window. It's so easy to get in and out of and very roomy. The 6 speed is smooth and makes the car feel like it has more then 122 HP. The engine in this car idles so smooth and quiet you have to look at the tach to make sure it's still running. Much less wind noise at highway speeds than I expected from a square car, ride's much smoother than I expected as well. Has more standard features than you usually find in an entry level car. Takes a little getting used to the absence of road feel (feedback).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Big doors and ease of entry / exit. Love the view and the way it drives. Love the styling, looks like nothing else on the road. Get's a lot of attention. Something you would expect to see a spaceman crawl out of. Adjustable rear seating. Rear swing open door, kinda looks like a micro-hearse</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I went from a huge van to the Cube a couple weeks ago. I was getting 14 MPG and my first tank was 22 MPG..all city driving. I am hoping this increases in time. I am 6' tall and large and the fit is good..plenty of leg room in the front. Not sure how tall people would do in the back. LOTS of looks from others and comments. It is a real novelty at this point. I also looked at Kia Soul and Scion. I am hot natured and both of those interiors came only in black. I like the white exterior and light grey interior I got. Plus, I feel Nissan is a better quality product. ( I sure hope so!)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am 49, 6ft.1, and this is a super roomy, and comfortable ride. I get 32 mpg on every tank. The engine is fairly quiet, except when you need the power. Then it can get a little louder than average, but not without a payback. Smooth ride. I don't know why people would say at 60 mph the wind noise is loud. It gets a little noisy above 70 mph, but is pretty quiet til then. [Unless there is a wind storm]I also meet a lot of new people with this car's curious looks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have purchased the cube about 4 weeks ago one drive is all it took. I'm 6'3" big build type of guy and i slid right in very roomy interior super easy to drive the visibility is awesome and this car in bitter chocolate is a head turner. Everywhere I go people stop me and ask me about the CUBE. I love this design so easy to get in and out of. A lot better than the new cars today, every car seems to be aero dynamic forcing tall people into Suv's or Trucks. Thanks Nissan for making a economical roomy vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A great sound system with the SL preferred Package. The climate system is all digital and very easy to use, the bluetooth and push button start no keys i love it. The panoramic view sold me the windshield is set back it doesn't come at you it feels like i'm sitting in a retro 60's car roomy interior A+</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this car with help from the CARS program. I fell in love with it the first time I drove it and I had to have it. I went from a super powered V8 truck to this little touring car and what it lacks in power it makes up in fun-ability. It drives like a go cart and it handles great on my curvy- mountain drive. Inside: Bluetooth, ipod connectivity, sat. radio, cool 20 led lites, cup holders in the right spots, ROOOOOMY and comfortable making my 32 mile commute (dare i say) FUN! Back seats flip down and my dog loves riding back there. Cool design is a head turner and ppl stop me daily or get the 'thumbs up' from strangers. If you like the way it looks, you will love the way it drives..</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Audio options, cup holder on the left drivers side, lighted center cup holder turns my water bottle into ART..R.Fosgate speaker. Seats are vertical like a chair & makes getting in and out easy. TOTALLY ROOMY--feels like sitting in a jacuzzi..Keyless entry/ignition is sweet..</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded a civic hybrid for my cube. In my opinion Nissan has come up with a winner with this vehicle. It has more room to comfortably accommodate my 6 ft 7 in husband and two teenage boys than our 2007 Expedition. The seats are very comfortable and the illumination package is a must. My kids love it at night. It is a perfect vehicle for commuting around town. The wind noise at highway speeds is noticeable but not significantly higher than my civic. The road noise is less by far. All is all we are very comfortable in the cube. It is much easier to park than most vehicles and it is very easy to get in and out of as compared with most cars. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have arthritis in multiple joints and have been suffering from hip pain for a year. I started looking for a car that was the right height and fit, because I realized that my Van was causing the hip pain. I was looking at Yahoo when I saw the Cube ad, so I checked it out on line first. I went to see the Cube and test drove it; I left with the one I test drove. I have had my Cube since July and I am having no more hip pain at all. Not only is it easy to get in and out of it is comfortable to sit in and drive. It handles beautifully and my brother who is large like me fit nicely in the back seat. I use a seated walker and it fits in the back easily. I am very glad I bought my Cube</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The room in the interior is my favorite part of my Cube, but I love the creativity that had to be used in its design all the way around. I am an art teacher and it is a great design inspiration.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted a smaller car but not one of those little cars that you have to fall down to get in and a lift to get out of it. This car is GREAT! You just slide on to the seat and you don't have to pry yourself out. It is so fun to drive and you get alot of looks. People laugh, like, what's that! Best small car I've ever owned. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the looks. Like having four headrests. Huge glovebox. Back hatch opens sideways, hooks to hold the floormat in place.back seat slide forward. More power than expected.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The greatest car I ever owned in terms of practicality and fun to drive. This vehicle was purchased under the program of car for clunkers by trading '95 Lexus sc400. Since the adoption of the car, I have been stunned every day by 1.8 liter engine's peppy performance on free way. I couldn't figure out how the small engine has the great power, compared to my previous 8 cylinder coupe. Last week, my four family took Cube to LasVegas trip rather than on my wife's mini van. All felt great through overnight round-trip because it has roomy and cushy seats with pretty good speakers. So, Every morning is pleasure itself.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The cube is absolutely amazing. It's like getting a minivan for the price of a Honda Fit. It's fun to drive due to stability control system, abs the acceleration is more than adequate, I'm over 6'1 and feel that there is plenty of space in front as well as in the rear, there is an incredible amount of headroom. You feel like you are driving a small bus, with turning and braking of a sports car. I recently went to home depot and after reclining back seats I was able to fit the screen door! I bought this car for my wife and I drive the bmw coupe myself which I rate 10/10 but still enjoy the CUBE after driving my beemer. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Amount of space, room, brakes, turning, gas mileage, stylish. Lots of amenities and features for the low price, cool character. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had a 2009 Cube S for a couple weeks now. Wow what a fun car! Im 44 years old and have owned many different makes and models of cars and trucks over the years but this new nissan is really something special. My 2 small children ages 5 and 2 fit really well in the back seat (in child seats) My wife is tall and she says it has more leg room than anything she has ever rode in. Fuel economy is really good, I drove it this past week on a 2 hour drive and got just over 30MPG at interstate speeds running AC. I like that the Back seats adjust back and forth a little to allow a little more space behind the back seats. Just right for all those grocery bags.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this about 3 weeks ago and am very happy. After researching, I thought I would try the Cube. Very nice. I would recommend this car for anyone who wants a smooth ride combined with great mpg. I am getting about 32-33. My husband who is blessed with long legs and big feet, found his 6 foot 2 inch frame fits fine. He can move his foot from gas pedal to brake without problem. People are surprised at the roomy interior. For such a small car it makes a powerful statement.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>good head room, easy exit from vehicle, good mpg city and highway, fits anywhere, great suspension and maneuverability, almost 360 degree viewing, handles okay in rain and wind, power is appropriate, smooth ride, quiet engine, head and tail lights excellent, sits higher than most compact cars</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the car two weeks ago. While having initial doubts, I have to admit that I love this car. I have a combined city/HWY of 30.5 MPG. This is much better than I expected and what it is rated for. It is very comfortable and I like the bluetooth. It drives smoothly below the 70 miles. If you expect to drive at a higher speed, this is not for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a reservation for a mid-size car with National at Sarasota airport. When my flight arrived, I was told all they had for me was a Nissan Cube. Well, it certainly did not look like a mid-size car, but I had no choice. I used it for a week and put on over 600 miles. First impression was that it was the ugliest thing I had ever seen. It looked like an aquarium on wheels. The car had a cvt transmission which nissan does a good job with as car is grossly underpowered. Wind noise at 75mph is unbelievable, no power on tap for passing, no feedback from steering and a confusing and illogical dash. It is the worst nissan vehicle I have ever driven and I have always liked and owned their products.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bottom line: this is an econobox so don't expect infiniti luxury. However, what this car does offer is unique headturning design (people will point/look all the time), great mileage (28 so far, but only first tank), decent build quality, great features in certain packages (bluetooth, auto climate, intell key), and unusual roominess inside. This car does it's job for me... Daily drive, good mileage, can load up on stuff when seats are folded, bt syncing, and above average stereo. What more can you ask for in this price range. CVT takes some getting use to. Suspension and steering is a little floaty at times. Bought the sl b/c krom doesnt have intellikey (very weird) conclusion: love my cube</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sl with preferred & ginormous is the best equipped model. You get the body kit, bluetooth, & intellikey (my favorite). Easy in & out. Storage is small, but all the good out weighs the bad. Info cluster is Nice. Shows current mileage so you know when you're saving gas. Again, love my cube!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased our Nissan Cube on July 3rd as a replacement third vehicle for our 18 and 20 year old daughters. We used the CARS program turning over our 1996 Cadillac in the process. However, now I can't get my wife out of it leaving the 08 Caravan for my daughters. This is a fun car to drive and it turns plenty of heads. There's an amazing amount of room for the driver and passengers, and visibility is fantastic. The pick up is more than adequate and the gas mileage has been better than expected: averaging over 32 mpg combined. Downside: road noise on the highway, but what do you expect for a car in this price range? Std air, power, ABS, and much more makes this easy to recommend. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling is unique, headroom is incredible. Power windows, cruise, decent stereo, ABS, and the swinging back door are great features, as is the reclining back seat. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We own an 06 Scion xB and when it was time to replace my car, we got the Cube. I wanted a Silver KROM, but the dealership (who was very unhelpful) couldn't (wouldn't) get a silver, so we got the black. I love it! It's so fun to drive, even though the transmission is a bit strange. Sound system is awesome, love the interior LED lighting, cubbyholes everywhere; the glove box is a bottomless pit! We're not in the "target age" they were going for when Nissan brought this car over, but who cares, *we're* the ones with the money! If you're tall or big, DEFINITELY GET THIS CAR! DH is 6'4, I'm 6' and we fit great! Love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I never submit reviews. Never. But, this car (mobile device) is such a revelation that I felt it warranted my two cents. One week in and we're getting stopped daily by people who just want to stare at it or sit in it or want to find out more about it. And, we've been happy to answer their questions. Actually, I think we sold 2 or 3 based on how people respond to the roominess, styling and just coolness of it. The ride is wonderful. Soooo smoooth. The CVT transmission is great. And, with the Ginormous package on our S, it is a real head turner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove the Soul Sport and the Soul+. There was no comparison with the Cube, The Soul had a choppy ride and was less nimble than the Cube. The Soul looked like every other car. The Cube is comfortable..the rear seat is like a couch/recliner. Nissan used the Maxima's foam rubber in all the seats. Controls are easy to use and if you can't see the top 1/4 of the dash (in an earlier review) there is seat height adjustment. I have found minimal road noise at speed. The BEST part of the Cube is the MPG. I have consistently been getting 34-36 mpg combined city/hwy mileage. The engine has a timing chain instead of the rubber ones that need replacing at 60,000 miles. I couldn't be happier!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MPG,MPG,MPG. The interior room and the seats. Also, the lack of a rubber timing chain(less maintenance dollars down the road)and the funky sheetmetal design.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I never thought we would own anything that looks like this, but wow! We are now looking for the color I want so I can have one too! We bought the Krom in steel grey. It's gorgeous! It turns on a dime and you don't feel like you're in a box. You really cannot fully appreciate it until you sit in it. It's relaxing and smooth riding to me. I haven't noticed any excessive outside wind noise yet. Gets a lot of attention that's for sure. I also feel you get a lot for the price. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior layout.The color choices. You can park it anywhere! The CVT took getting used to, but it's great.I like the safety features. It's just comfortable to be in. People will stop to talk to you about this car everywhere you go. If you don't like attention-this isn't the car for you</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Gave in to the wife's wishes to go for the quirky styling and better gas mileage. It sure gets it's share of thumbs-ups and curious looks, which is good because we have sign graphics for our business on the back window. Unexpected 30.5mpg mileage for her daily 140-mile roundtrip to a new office, 50% better mileage than our Pathfinder. This alone will save us $200 a month. I like a lot of features, esp. with the SL package, and some I don't like, see below.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Intelligent key. No more locked-in keys. (But "valet key" can only lock/unlock doors, unless I'm missing something). XM radio/upgraded stereo. Bluetooth (except trouble with a Blackberry, plus only works 1 phn at a time). Comfortable seating. Roomy. Big glove compartment. Turning radius. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My husband finally had to give up his Nissan Frontier for commuting (265,000 miles on it). We started looking at other Nissan's, even a Pathfinder, when we saw the Cube sitting on the lot. I begged him to test drive it, he got out and said, "Let's do it." He's been like a kid in a candy shop ever since!! Every day he finds something new he likes about it. It's a lot of fun. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The view from the windows. Also like the 20+ color interior lights-- something to play with, the bluetooth, and let's not forget that awesome sound system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have traded in my 06 Acura TL w/ Navi. Since I was sick of driving TL (Don't get me wrong. TL is a nice car), I wanted to get infiniti G37x or Nissan 370 Z. However, my wife liked the look of Cube, and she liked it because of high gas mileage compared to our 06 TL and 07 MDX. I had this car for 4 days. So far, this car gives me a good gas mileage, and I get a lot of attention from people because of its unique appearance. Cube is roomier than it looks and 1.8 SL with SL package gives you many useful features. Interior lighting features and luminating kick plate add an accent to the car as well. Driving is not as powerful as TL, however, it serves its purpose with decency. Very nice car</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the Cube yesterday and my husband has a seeing eye dog and he has plenty of room in the back seat. I have had several people ask me about the car and I tell them try one you will like it. I love it we also have a Honda Odessay but use the Cube in town and have a ball.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Picked up my Krom a week ago and I'm 250 miles in. A couple minor bugs but overall very happy. I'm 6'4" and have plenty of room. Comfortable seats, quiet ride and great creature features. Plenty of power although the CVT takes awhile to get accustomed to. Very fun to drive and fit and finish are very good. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Today, I was introduce to the "cube". I even test drove it. At first I was like uh... I dunno. But then I saw the White one and I was like hmmm... I'm actually liking this. I have never been interested in buying a box type of car. But I found this one to be different. The more I looked at it, the more I liked it! However, it did remind me a lil bit of a circus feel, but I think that it makes it fun. The gas mileage is grreat, the price isn't too bad, compared to other vehicles. I thought it only looked good in White. Throw on some tint, and Nice wheels. And it's gonna look good! Overall, I think people will buy this for the good mileage and the fair price. I'll probably go buy one next week!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>the visibility, you can fit this car anywhere,and the seats are pretty comfortable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle has design appeal, something I wanted without paying luxury pricing. The controls in the car are very techno, handling is superb. I had five adults in the car, and everyone was comfortable. Air Conditioning works great, very important since I live in Arizona. My only disappointment is that the Radio is not XM ready. I have contacted Nissan about this, and hopefully this can be resolved without using a FM modulated aftermarket unit. Since I have just taken delivery on my vehicle, it is hard to get into the mechanical aspects, but find it generally very tight and responsive. Great job Nissan design team!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were seriously considering the Scion xB for over a year, but when the Cube came out, decided to give it a try, as well as the Kia Soul. We disliked the new body style of the Scion, as it made it look like a pint-sized Dodge Caravan, and we were unimpressed by the cheap feel and horrendous road noise of the Kia. The Cube was perfect for us. It seats ample-sized adults easily, with loads of head and legroom. The reclining/sliding rear seats are a great feature as well. We love the quirky styling, and we are stopped by strangers frequently who want to know more about the car. It handles well and is incredibly maneuverable! This car is more fun to drive than the '71 Beetle I had in college!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a big person, 6'8", 265 pounds and the interior provides adequate room. The seats are extremely comfortable. I bought the Krom with Blue Tooth, however the interior noise at 60+ mph makes it difficult to hear and to be heard. The noise is so loud it sounds like my windows are down. I no longer use the Blue Tooth. Mileage has been around 30-31 on the highway, a little less around town. The car is gutless so do not expect it to be snappy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats are great. I wish I could the Bluetooth.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We got a Super Black SL w/Preferred Package. For those of you who are trying decide between the Box Cars, keep the Cube on your list. I feel the reviews by the "pros" are forgetting who the real-world drivers are or something, but the Cube is really a pretty nice vehicle, especially for under $20k. The car is plenty powerful enough to get off the line and into traffic on the freeway. Body roll is not as bad as the reviewers led me think and visibility is amazing. Additionally, it turns on a dime. We don't like the currently styling of the xB or the Soul compared to the Cube. We're wrapping the Cube for advertising purposes and we feel the styling of the Cube will an attention getter.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats are VERY comfortable. We took a 200 mile commute and no one experienced any lower back pains. Creature features (e.g. auto temperature and radio) on the SL Trim, intelligent key (LOVE THIS), styling. Synced up to iPhone (2G) very easily after reviewing instructions in the manual.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car yesterday - I went to look at the Altima and the Maxima; the dealership had just gotten their first Cubes, so I was curious. I was sold as soon as I sat in it. It's deceivingly big on the inside! My husband is 6'1" and when he sits in the driver seat, there is still a good 8-10" of head room. It has very comfortable seats and is extremely easy to get in and out of. The back seat offers again, tons of room and it slides forward or backward to give you either more leg room or more cargo room. I have a 5 year old who uses a booster seat and it's been hard finding something that is easy to get her in and out of, until now. The fun part...it's a blast to drive!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>THE ROOM! Fun and different look to it, rockin' sound system, and the bluetooth capability to call from your call and talk hands free is AWESOME!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well I didn't actually purchase it, though if I had money for the downpayment, I would have taken it right then and there. I test drove it, although I would prefer the SL trim level, but they didn't have it yet. The ride, very comfortable, very smoothe, and enjoyable. When you see it in person, it is really strange, it looks so small, like a rock or a toaster with wheels, but CAVERNOUS inside. I really hope I can purchase it.</TEXT>
