<TEXT>I have never owned a Lexus. Previously we owned a 2001 C320 Mercedes, which I loved. It was just not a reliable vehicle, in the shop for problems at least once a year. After reading reviews about the ES350 we decided to give it a try. So far I'm enjoying the car. The ride is nice, not quite as quiet as the Mercedes, but very nice. Gas mileage is great, 29mpg can't complain about that. GPS is fun, and the bluetooth I like. No complaints so far...</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>GPS, air-conditioned seats, bluetooth</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought the 09 with Levinson, Nav, and ultra luxury package in the Matador Red. The thing is gorgeous and fun to drive! I traded in an Impala, so this is a whole different ballgame. Got a great deal since the '10s are coming in. Highly recommend getting the Levinson.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation, Levinson Stereo, Ride. Handles like a dream and is so comfortable. The panoramic roof with the two sunroof option is cool too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just got a 09 ES 350, with premium plus package and extras at invoice. Great value compared to G37, Maxima SV, Genesis and CTS. Ride is very comfortable, obviously not sporty, but it's also not "Buickesse" either, unlike some reviews have stated. The engine is very smooth and really moves this vehicle in manual shift. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated/ventilated memory leather seats, bluetooth, wood grain trim, quiet ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Lexus and what a car it is! Love almost everything about it. The acceleration is as smooth as can be and you are pampered in the most sumptuous surroundings when inside. However, one annoying quirk is the fact that the 2009 model is missing a pop- out hanger hook. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration, leather feel, display look, the curvy body, parking sensors, backup camera (I don't remember the last time that I turned my head back to see how close the car in back was to my rear bumper... really cool).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought a 2009 ES 350 - got a smoking good deal as the dealers are getting ready for the 2010's and want to move the 2009's out. $200 under invoice on a fully loaded model, premium plus, navigation, etc. I really like all of the features and have not experienced the GPS or Bluetooth probs another reviewer mentioned. Car handles like a dream, smooth, quiet, plenty of power. I drove and researched many other makes and models such as the Infiniti G37, Hyundai Genesis, etc. The ES 350 was the best of the bunch and the best bang for the buck, too. So far, so good.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>air conditioned seats, big glass moonroof, kickin' sound system, navigation that will find nearby restaurants just from a voice command of "find Italian food!"</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The ride on this baby is super smooth. I went for the front-wheel drive and the fuel economy is a superb 29 on my daily commute. It is whisper quiet but can also pour on the power when needed. The navigation system is good but the GPS could use an update to provide better directions. Speakers are top notch as is the air conditioning. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The ES is the best luxury value sedan in my opinion. It's all weather friendly and it offers plenty of power and it's loaded up with equipment all for $42000 for a full size sedan. Something you need to pay $10000 more for a Mercedez, BMW or Infinity and you sacrifice the fuel economy because of a heavy all wheel drive. The car is quiet and nimble, smooth and extremely stylish.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Wood interior, back up camera, passenger memory seating, and 10 airbags.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has everything - great looks and performance. I feel like I'm driving in my living room. Love the very quiet and smooth ride from the V6 272 HP engine. The Mark Levinson Sound System is incredible.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mark Levinson/Navigation System. Intuitive parking assist and rear camera. SmartAccess and Push Button Start/Stop. Personalized steering wheel, seat and mirror settings.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 272 hp, 3.5 V6 liter engine rockets the Lexus ES 350 from zero to 60 in 6.8 seconds, better than the 2009 Mercedes Benz C300 Sport?s 228 hp 3.0 liter V6 (7.1 secs.) or the 2009 BMW 328i automatic?s 230 hp 3.0-liter V6 (6.9 secs.) With 95.4 cu ft. of interior space and 14.7 cu. ft. of cargo space, the Lexus has considerably more room for car seats, strollers, etc. than either the BMW (93 cu. ft. int./ 12 cu. ft. cargo) or the Mercedes (88.2 cu. ft. int./ 12.4 cu. ft. cargo). And it's packed with options that would make Q jealous (voice activated GPS, back up camera, air conditioned seats). It cradles you after the daycare drop off and can waste most of the other cars on the road. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>3.5 liter, 272 hp. engine. Air conditioned seats. MP3 cd player (turns the stereo into a jukebox even without an iPod). Voice activated GPS ("nearest Japanese restaurant"). Bluetooth speaker phone. Backup camera.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the first Lexus I have owned and couldn't be happier. I only drove about 800 miles, but there isn't anything I seriously dislike about the vehicle. All of the necessary features are great and the ride is beautiful. I tend to be a leadfoot and this car has not let me down, although the handling is a little light. I test drove 14 different cars, seriously researched 26, and have always bought American previously. The price was great, $8,000-$10,000 below domestic competitors in its class with similar features. Needless to say, this was a big consideration when purchasing. The dealership was A+. Give it a try-you'll fall in love!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Before buying this Lexus, I previously owned two Toyotas. So far, my Lexus lives up to the same reliability. Power, looks, features, you can't go wrong. I love the navigation and audio. Acceleration is smooth and it rides quiet. This car is roomy in the front and back. I test drove the Acrua TL and the Volvo S60, but neither was as exciting as my ES350. The fall back is that some of the amenities look and feel cheap especially the trunk handles. You only get two keys. Even though I have park assist, I still find it difficult looking over my shoulder backing up and I also find the seating uncomfortable after driving long periods of time. I would buy this car again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have never owned a Lexus before. I was impressed by the test drive and buying experience. However, since owning the car for a while the integrated GPS is disaster and the blue tooth phone system does not work well either. I think it has to do with the microphone placement. I also own a Ford explorer (which has its own issues) but the GPS and bluetooth phone features just plain work better. I don't think I will buy another Lexus. I expected to pay more and have an issue free car but that is not the case.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Air conditioned vented seats work great. I did not care about the feature when I bought the car but now I love it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I previously owned a 1998 ES300 and logged 154000 miles without a major problem. The amazing thing is that the purchase price of the 2009 was about the same with more equipment standard. If this car is nearly as good as my old Lexus, I will be more than satisfied. I have only driven it about 2000 miles but I am very impressed with the power, quality and economy of this car.</TEXT>
