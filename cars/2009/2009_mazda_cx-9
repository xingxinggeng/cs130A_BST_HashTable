<TEXT>After 5500 miles the CX-9 is proving to be an excellent family vehicle. Even the third row seats are suitable for short trips. For a 7 passenger SUV the acceleration and handling are outstanding. The interior design is up to that Acura and Audi standard. I test drove the Acura MDX, Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander. All of them are nice but the combination of price, design, size and performance made the Mazda a clear choice for my family of 5. Bottom line, I enjoy driving it and my wife appreciates the design and space for shuttling children. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design. Acceleration and handling. 20 inch wheels look great. The blind spot warning system has surprised me with how well it functions. It lets you know when a vehicle is in your blind spot. A nice safety feature during highway driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Best 3-row SUV out there. Drove Mercedes, Lexus, Cadillac, Audi and Volvo, none compared on interior quality and exterior style to the CX- 9. Top that off with a price which was minimally $10K less than anything else, and you have a real winner. GT package does shift the ride quality to the firm side, but the handling achieved more than compensates. Car has every bell and whistle found on the "high priced badges" with better styling interior and exterior than any of them. Dealership experience has been excellent.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Technology package, bluetooth, navigation, ipod capability and the incredible blind spot warning system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We traded a xc90 awd as we needed more room in the back seats. Would have never thought about the Mazda cx9 beyond reading the reviews. Once my wife and I drove it we loved it. Cool looking mommy wagon without the geekness of a minivan or suv. Very fast, handles well and looks way cool.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Let me start by saying we never expected to like this vehicle so much. It was more of a "let's take a look so we can eliminate one more option". But when you get behind the wheel and give this SUV a good look trust me if you buy another SUV I will be shocked. It is as close to perfect as you will find. It is simply THE best kept secret in the mid-size SUV/Crossover market. Great size not to big not too small. Usable third row with as much legroom as many full size SUV. Great build quality. Smart engineering and logical design/layout. Drives as much like a sports car as possible in an SUV. All the safety features. Unbelievable upscale features on the Grand Touring for the money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>As a replacement for our minivan (Nissan Quest), the CX-9 is nearly as versatile, just as comfortable and much more fun to drive. The acceleration is excellent, the ride is smooth and the handling makes it feel much smaller than it actually is. We've been on some 5 hour road trips with no complaints from our 2 teens in back. We've also filled the 3rd row with teen-aged friends with no complaints on in-town trips. The front seating area could use some more storage space and the mpg is merely adequate but overall this is an excellent choice for those who need a versatile carrier.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Picked up the Touring AWD on 9/15/09. All I can say is that Mazda has the gem of 2009 here. Forget Toyota and Ford, test drive the CX-9 and you will be in for a shock. There are items that come standard in this puppy that you would have to get as options on anything else. With the dealer incentives (4k) you are driving away with a vehicle that would cost 40 large anywhere else! Factor in the end of Model year and dealerships trying to get rid of inventory.. there is just a ton of value here! Our 3 kids love this vehicle for the space and the wife adores it because it literally drives like a car. Before you buy anything else.. Test drive the Mazda CX-9</TEXT>

<TEXT>Its hard to believe this is an SUV. It handles superbly and feels solid as a rock. I'm comfortable knowing my wife and kids use this full time. Much better than the competition for handling/ride at this price level. Surprisingly smooth and comfortable but could still use some improvements comfort wise. A superb value though all things considered. Hopefully reliability will be better than predicted and compare better with Toyota and others.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Feel/handling amazing; dual dim/color dash lights; keyless entry is the bomb; lots of space in the back for cargo; smooth shifting; great ext paint job (red); Its really a surprise, it's a GREAT vehicle. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Drove home in intense storm, but CX-9 took it all in stride while other cars pulled to the side. Seats are outstanding for long hauls. Able to have normal conversations at freeway speeds. Car never feels tippy despite having 8 inches of ground clearance. At 200 inches, it is a long vehicle, but doesn't feel that way. Bose stereo is weak on highs, but midrange sounds good when connected to an ipod. Feels german in driving experience.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking to replace a 2004 MDX. The newer MDX while very impressive is mid 50s with all options....Ouch! The dash of the new MDX has way too much going on. The CX9 was a surprise for sure. For what you get this is by far the best in the larger 3rd row SUVs. Many people actually see this rig and think it is a Lexus. You don't see as many of the cx9s on the road and I cannot figure out why. We have three small children and did not want to go mini-van.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the cx9! We test drove several cars until we decided to purchase a cx9. We need the room of a minivan, but wanted something to please our teenage children. They also love it! It drives like a car, similar to mazda6. It is a large roomy suv, but feels smaller than it is. We love using it for our children sport events, easy to bring cooler and gear for needed for games. The sport version of the CX9 is a great value, you get many standard features for your money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned a Lexus LX470 and Toyota Products for years and were quite impressed with quality and character of new Mazda's. Mazda has made the CX-9 both comfortable and fun to drive. The only flaw I see is the lack of AWD all the time and using a sport tire (ie will last at most 30k miles if lucky) vs a more all weather tire with a longer life.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Internal comfort, quality, and sportiness that is similar to Audi, Acura, Buick, and Volvo, but at a much cheaper price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When compared with its rivals and their sticker prices, the CX-9 is in tough company. However, when you look at what you'll actually pay for them, the CX-9 looks much better. It appears to be the value leader - very nicely appointed, sports-car zoom-zoom handling (which you won't find in the competitors), and feature laden. Even my skinny 7 year old can slide the center seats to access the rear (she couldn't do that in the Tahoe we had). Speaking of the Tahoe, when we compared them side-by-side, the CX-9 has more depth behind the rear seats, and has more depth when the rear seats are folded. I wouldn't have believed that if I hadn't seen it myself...</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty drive - in a class by itself here; not bone-jarring, but no cushy luxo-cruiser. The seats are great and the interior lighting is a nice touch. Fit & finish is very good. Best value in the class.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was hit broadside (T-boned) on the passenger side at an intersection. Lady ran a red light and hit me. I must say I am thankful I bought the CX- 9. The side curtain airbag deployed instantly (no white powder, clean) the doors and structure took the impact and protected me, I was completely unhurt. While both front and rear doors were completely crushed the doors did not bend into the inside, the side windows did not break. As a matter of fact the doors STILL opened and closed. Mazda has built an extremely safe and exceptional vehicle. The CX-9 was repaired (two new doors)and is back on the road as good as new. Feel free to read my previous review dated 1/13/09. Thanks Mazda, life saver!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We did a lot of looking around and test driving. We liked the Ford Flex, Buick Enclave, and GMC Acadia, but the Mazda CX-9 was just a better deal all around. We were able to get more options for the price than we could have with the others. It has a sporty body style, and the 20" rims just sweeten the deal! The 2nd row can adjust, so you can move the seats up to make extra room for the 3rd row. The 2nd row seats also partially recline which is a favorite feature for my kids. This car is definitely fun to drive. It's smooth! Even with 20" wheels, it's still a smooth and comfortable ride. If looking at the CX-9, definitely check out the Grand Touring, the options are great!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation system, Back-up camera, Advanced keyless entry, Bose Sound (awesome!), Power Liftgate, Bluetooth, Blindspot Monitor, Dual Temp controls for driver/passenger, Leather seats, Integrated garage door opener, AND we had Remote start added, and it's awesome!!! Love, Love, LOVE my Zoom Zoom! :)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We wanted a road car to replace three previous Buick Ultras. We drove GMC, Chevrolet, Saturn and Hyundai SUV's. The wife did not want a 'bus' feel and when we drove the CX-9, it hit the mark for size and comfort. We have over 11,000 miles in ice, snow and 100-degree heat and lots of night driving. The Xenon headlights are a true plus. The 20-inch wheels give the vehicle the stance and driving feel that we really enjoy. We have commented several times how much we love our '9' and do not miss our three big Buicks. One minor recall for power seat cable placement - other than that - she goes!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Xenon Headlights, Blind Spot monitoring, large wheels, cargo space, quiet interior, great feel for the road. Have driven in 30+ mph crosswind and is very stable, even around semi-trucks. Punch it and it goes. Great transmission and shift-points.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Basically a acura mdx for someone on a budget like me - get some great features and utility worthy of luxury- level vehicles for an affordable price. Fuel economy is the big downside but no vehicle in this class is any more impressive. I can honestly say this large cuv is pretty fun to drive... Easily comparable to my 05 murano even though it's bigger.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove many and this car was the clear value leader (IF you can still get the generous discounts). Safety was a high-priority and the CX-9 has every safety device/feature available on vehicles under $50,000 - except Daytime Running Lights!? Excellent handling/steering. Design and features impress everyone from teens to middle-aged. To be sure, it rides a little rough on typical streets -- you will feel all the bumps -- but has the most comfortable car seats I've ever sat in (and I don't have leather). Maybe the best thing is that it's a big car, but doesn't look or drive like one. No car is perfect, but the minor annoyances on this one are more than made up by the outstanding ones. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling and maneuverability. Bluetooth operation. High visibility (both by driver and being seen by other cars). Seats and dashboard. Heated mirrors to clear fog and ice. Automatic climate control. Storage room behind 3rd row. Cruise/Radio controls on steering wheel. Orange instrumentation, for now</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Normally we travel on long trips in our Grand Caravan, but on this trip from Detroit to Mackinac over Memorial Day we drove the CX-9. My teenage daughter that seems to complain about everything these days had nothing but praise for the CX-9. So did the other kids. Despite being smaller, it really felt like there was more interior room. I couldn't believe all the luggage and the people I was able to haul comfortably. Much more fun to drive than the mini-van too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hands-down the easiest bluetooth paring I have ever dealt with. The cruise control was so easy to adjust that I was able to cruise most of the way up and down I-75 on Memorial Day weekend with the cruise on.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It was between the 09 Honda pilot and the cx9 and for the price the cx9 won out. I would have spent over $40k to get the features in the cx9. It is really fun to drive, smooth, comfortable and quiet. Brakes really Nice and after 4 months without it being cleaned, I have very minimal brake dust. Haven't had any problems so far. I had a durango before the cx9 so it does sit quite a bit lower.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car! I live in my car for work with a typical drive of over 10 hours a week and this car is made for me. The radio features allow easy reception anywhere, the seat is very comfortable and the Bluetooth will end up saving my life. And so very, very fun to drive. Researched to death and came down to this or the Highlander. One look and I was in love.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth, Bose stereo, feature that pre-sets stations as you're just passing through a town. Smooth ride and silky steering. Seat more comfortable than my living room. So much space can fit my 6'5" boys in the back and my shorter girls in the way- back with room to spare.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have an 11 month old baby and another one on the way so decided to trade in the Saab 9-3 sportwagon and look for something larger. Minivans were out of the question so we looked at the crossover segment and settled on the CX-9 GT AWD. We chose it primarily for it's space, handling and exterior style. So far we have not been disappointed. It's comfortable, easily stores the family and our gear and is actually fun to drive. It's also a stylish looking vehicle and way more interesting than a minivan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our search came down to a used 2008 Ford Edge or a new 2009 Mazda CX-9. The Mazda won out because of the favorable lease terms that were being offered. The car is fun to drive and the engine has plenty of zip. The transmission is silky smooth. Drives like a smaller car, even with third row capacity. Ride is on the stiff side. Engine is quiet. Form and fit are good; no rattles. 3rd row offers nice space, but seems to do so at the expense of the 2nd row. The width of the driver's compartment is cramped. Not the easiest car to get in and out of (watch your head vs. frame). Console storage not good considering space it takes up. Gawky radio nobs on dash. Nice car, although I'm not wowed by it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The CX-9 is good looking and fairly responsive for a heavy vehicle. But, the engine developed a ticking noise at 12k miles. NOT what I would expect from a $40k car. Been in twice to fix, but has returned twice. Dealer service is OK, not on par with Acura, BMW, Lexus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We are expecting our second child and our Mazda tribute is now too small when carrying people around (we had to drive two cars). So we started looking for a 7 passenger vehicle, the choices were between the Pilot, Highlander, Traverse and the CX-9. The Pilot and the Traverse had finishing touches that seemed cheap, the Highlander exterior design seems as it did not know if it wanted to be a truck or a car so it chose something in between. At the end we got the CX-9 because we qualified for the 0% APR and no money down. Hey why pay cash when the bank is giving you money for free! So far no buying remorse.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the technology: Bluetooth, integrated garage opener, satellite radio, navigation, back up camera, blind spot sensor. And the exterior design is just beautiful. The 0% financing plus 500 cash-back and 1000 loyalty bonus went a long way to make this an easy decision.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After several months of looking at all SUVs and X-overs I selected the CX-9. Am I glad I did - the build quality, workmanship, features, value, fuel economy (first 240 miles city with 62 miles freeway got 18.5 MPG!!), fun to drive, and performance all add up to a best in class up and down the price scale. Much better than all contenders. This is a little known gem that will have a very bright future as soon as folks get to know and see them on the road. Outstanding lines, sports car handling, family friendly, equally at home in a tux or Levis. This is a rare find in a market cluttered with "me too" and "ordinary offerings". A must drive if you are in the market, no disappointments here.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought and so far, am VERY impressed with my CX-9. It replaced a 3 year old Volvo XC-90. Feels solid, drives great, looks great and I actually prefer it over the Volvo. Plenty of room inside to buy just about anything with the seats down. Rear seat heat and a/c is actually effective. Keyless everything is great. For the price, it can't be beat. I looked at much more expensive vehicles including Audi, Mercedes and Lexus and aside for the interior wood trim, softer leather and a little extra glitz in these high end crossovers, the Mazda is a winner and represents incredible value. It really has everything you'd ever want.</TEXT>
