<TEXT>I love this car. It has the speed when you need it, with the look and feel of a luxury sports car. I traded in my Lexus RX 330 with no regrets. The interior is lovely with many features. I just wish that the rear offered better visibility. You really need to be careful when making a lane change. I rely a lot on my mirrors and must turn my head to look before I change lanes. Wicked blind spot. I also wish that they had a self closing rear hatch. Otherwise, love this car and very happy with the purchase. I will let you know how the AWD does when snow flies. I live in Alaska, so that should be soon!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lush interior and sleek look on interior. Love the climate control seats, sound system, warning systems. Has power when you need it. One hot ride. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought a 2009 FX 3 weeks ago, trading in a 2006. Upgraded to Nav with touchscreen. So far, a lot of disappointments 1) It's slower! I punch it getting on the freeway, it hiccups. The 2006 took off! 2) Adding Nav adds other functions, like touchscreen, traffic, but diminishes other features: a) Reduces bluetooth phonebook capacity by 75% b) eliminates ability to program pause (worked on 06) c) added, cumbersome steps to dial phone d)sound system audio quality diminished e) ipod interface nice, but ipod, battery runs down after car shutoff - auto-turn-on, not turnoff. 3) much less room in backseat-my riders complain 4) promised improved mileage is really worse -just a bigger gas tank.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Not only did the transmission not upshift smoothly, now I am getting the same problem as others on the downshift side. Engine revs to 5k as I am pulling in to a stop. Thank goodness my foot is already on the brake. Talk about dangerous. This has shades of the mid-80's Audi all over it. In addition to an intermittently functioning Nav screen, a non-charging iPod, and braking "pulls" to the left and right... quite honestly, you can have this machine. Unfortunately, it's on a 4 year corporate lease. Pooched.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the FX 35 AWD w/Premium, NAV, Deluxe Touring, and a few other options. Love the NAV and around view monitor. Once you get used to it, it's a breeze. 20 inch tires and rims look great, as well as the real maple wood trim inside. Upgraded leather has a very rich feel to it. I am not sure if my transmission was repaired from the dealership already, but no problems so far (3,500 miles). </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am in sales and drive a lot. I wanted a car that was fun to drive, looked great, and had some space to carry my equipment. The FX fit the bill to a T. The NAV works great (once I figured it out), around view cameras are wonderful, gas mileage is not bad for an SUV of this class, and it still works great for hauling the kids and groceries. I traded in a BMW X5 that I loved, but now don't miss at all anymore. The FX gets much better mileage, and the interior styling blows away both the X5 as well as the X6. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I took delivery in April, and this car has been nonstop fun ever since. I also have a 2007 G35, so I do love Infiniti. I test drove an X5, Q7, RX, ML and nothing drove and handled as well for the value. I bought every option package and got online (buy all my cars by way of carsdirect) for $9780 off sticker. I was only not able to get the illuminated kick plates. I plan to see if my transmission needs to be reflashed for software, but it actually seems to be improving with mileage so maybe won't need to soon.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the Deluxe Touring package the most as compared to the regular tires and don't find the ride too harsh. Tech Package with surround cameras--I would never have another vehicle without them. Stereo is great and love the IPOD interface system. Ventilated seats, but wish quieter. Quilted leather.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall I love this car. I think its the perfect vehicle for sports car guys that need just a little bit of utility. Great get-up and go power, has all the amenities that I need right now. The only thing that is a bit annoying is the upshift with the transmission, there is a hesitation at times that is very noticeable. But, overall a wonderful vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>What an amazing car. Between the climate controlled seats, key fob options, electronically controlled retractable mirrors, 360 degree view camera, Nav, reclining back seats, intelligent AWD, great ride, and unique looks, this car is the best! When doing the Edmunds comparison with its competitors the MDX, X5, X6, and RX the FX really shines. Tightest turning radius (by far), offers most front leg room (by many inches), 2nd best in gas mileage, and is one of the least expensive. If you need an SUV for hauling ability this is not for you. If you are looking for more of the "sport" from the sports utility vehicle category there is no other choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Recently traded in my '04 FX35 for an '09 FX35 and have no regrets. Comfort is all you feel when driving or riding in it. The '09 FX35 is significantly smoother and quieter than the '04. I actually enjoy driving now...doesn't feel (or sound) like an SUV but rather a luxury vehicle. The controls are all within easy reach. The Technology Package is a must! As far as the gas consumption, it's not any better than my '04. My opinion is that if you can afford to buy a new FX35, fuel prices/consumption should not be an issue. TIP: Drive it w/TLC! </TEXT>

<TEXT>The only single word I can think of to describe this automobile is AMAZING! It drives great (now the transmission is fixed), looks great, sounds great, and is priced great when compared to so called rivals. I test drove the Acura, Lexus, and BMW competing SUV's. Although they all had some great highlights, overall the Infiniti blew them away. It has the performance of the BMW's, all the features of the Acura, and much much better styling then the Lexus. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Infiniti. While I enjoy the unique exterior style of the new SUV (as well as some of the gadgets) I must admit that the 7 speed transmission drive train leaves me speechless... in a bad way. The transmission wants to shift into high gear (7th?) at road speeds of 25mph. Even in DS mode it is not appreciably different. And if you have to climb any degree of incline at 25mph... wow... the vehicle labors vigorously. There is no downshift without pressing the accelerator halfway to the floorboard; at which point the RPM goes to 5k and the vehicle lungs forward. I hope they do some reprogramming of shift patterns.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our FX35 last February. I've been very happy with our purchase, my partner somewhat less so. The car is great fun to drive. The exterior takes a bit of getting used to, but the interior is class all the way. There were two significant issues. The first is rotten rear visibility - either you get used to relying heavily on the rear view and birds-eye cameras or you don't. The second was the transmission. It tended to search for the right gear, refuse to change quickly when floored, and just shift roughly. But there is now an available transmission re-flash (reprograms the computer) - ask about ITB09-032. It works wonders, completely solves the problem. Thanks, Infiniti!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Good mix between luxury & performance. Luxury on par with RX330 (prev auto) but performance is superior. Plus, you only see limited quantities on the road. Manual shift toggles are a blast! Gadgets galore. Fully loaded w/all 5 pkgs. Active/passive safety features were draw to FX. 7 sp trans works well despite complaints from other reviews. If I need additional power/response I use the toggles and shift manually. Interior space is adequate. I am 6-3 and I can fit comfortably in front seats/rear seats are a little cramped on legroom. The FX35 allows the best of both worlds, I can fulfill my performance desire as well as obtaining moderate functionality of SUV. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>PROS: Exterior body styling/interior layout, 360 cam is awesome, leg room, instrument panel design, navigation, cooled seats, handles GREAT. Dual personality of FX35, modifies to spirited or normal driving. Looks of curiosity I get on road. Great freeway mileage. </FAVORITE>

CONS: no full power trunk door, transmission is slow sometimes unless you floor it, poor gas mileage, wish the trunk organizer was to one side of the trunk instead of smack in the middle not allowing you to put any big items in without having to fold it down. Very fun to drive, and I love the big gas tank. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a fully loaded FX35, but I am disappointed about the car. When driving in highway, the car sometimes hesitates to shift to a lower gear during acceleration and it chokes up! First time, I reported this problem to the dealer, they told me ?Infiniti is aware of the problem but doesn?t have a fix for it yet?, but later on, they took it back and said ?This is a Normal Behavior?! They just had a recall on the replacement of Steering Column Electrical Tilt Motor. Also, only after 5000 miles, the dealer had to keep my car for 1 week to fix rear window. After one week, they gave the car back to me unfixed and told me that ?Infiniti doesn?t have the spare part in inventory?!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded a Mazda RX8 a few years ago for an Infiniti G35 couple. I thought I was getting more room while keeping the fun drive. I just traded in my G35 for a new FX35 and I am in love! This car has incredible style, has great pickup and hugs the road far more than my G35 did. Plus I get the extra room that I didn't have in either of my last two cars. I still miss the sports car feel of the RX8, but this FX35 makes me smile every time I get in and push the start button. Highly recommend it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Infiniti after driving an '04 FX and an '05 G35, which I enjoyed tremendously. I had to have what was marketed as a new and improved FX for '09. I think the new styling is incredible. However, I have never been so unhappy with a vehicle's performance. I'm beside myself - I just threw away $40K+. In slow and go traffic, the shifting is all over the place while it attempts to find the right gear. Unless I'm able to drive aggressively, I find the 7-speed transmission unacceptable. From a stop it performs great. Once at about 22 mph is where I realize issues. Several times, when coming to a stop I thought I got bumped from the rear as the car has lunged - it's just not smooth. :(</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had the 1st FX for 5yrs. Loved the car. So I had to get the new one. Big mistake! Great gadgets, great look! But the new transmission takes away all the joy! It downshifts like someone driving a stick shift for the 1st time. Very lazy, not smooth, brakes are horrible. The car downshifts and accelerates in traffic at the same time and it's in gear 6 or 7 when you're driving 30 miles. So to accelerate the car your really have to kick down hard and it takes days for the car to respond. My experience has been so bad, I'll be changing the car soon. </TEXT>

New front end a little strange but it is a sharp looking SUV and I get questions about it wherever I go. A/C keeps the car cool even in Mississippi summers. Quieter on the highway too.

<TEXT>This is a great vehicle. Performance is outstanding, and the fit and finish is of the highest quality - truly a luxury car. Rear interior space is somewhat limited compared to a "regular" crossover SUV, but is still more room than a sedan. The limited rear visibility is not a serious problem, but it means that the back-up camera is an absolute must- have. Mileage has been poor (16 mpg) on mostly in-town driving, but you should not be buying this car for great mileage. The handling is great, but the car seems to have a slight hesitation when it down-shifts while coasting at slow (below 20 mph) speeds. Don't know if that is due to CVT or something else. Overall, one great vehicle!</TEXT>

Great pickup, excellent brakes, fit and finish far better, navig., around view camera excellent. Styling is a love/hate - no cookie cutter here. Unique and bold - a true sports truck. Best bang for the buck. Acura, BMW - no comparison... electronics styling way beyond the competition.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the FX35 for a little over a month now and it has been a blast to drive. Interior layout is very clean & well thought out. Everything flows perfectly. I know some don't like the exterior but it has grown on me. I would recommend getting the Deluxe Touring package which gives you the 20 inch wheels. The 18s are a bit small compared to the size of the FX. All the tech features work well. The Nav has room for improvement. You can't use the all the features when in motion. The search function needs to be more customizable. Its 7spd tranny is way too slow to respond. It hunts for the right gear in traffic. It has slipped a couple of times. They should have left the old 5spd in.</TEXT>

Much tighter vehicle all around, better craftsmanship, it's a whole new world. The car is a joy to drive, and when you are on the highway, the drive is remarkably smooth. Highly recommended.

The 7 speed auto is really good while cruising on the highway. The rpms stay around 2500 for 75 mph. Not bad for a vehicle of this size. I got the AWD, Prem, Nav, Deluxe touring. I would say the Deluxe touring is a must have. The 20" look awesome on the FX. Over all it blows the competition out of water. No plastic wood no cheap stuff. Good sound insulation when compared with the G. Absolutely no rattles and everything is very tight and solidly built. </TEXT>

<TEXT>For a high end SUV the FX35 competes well, with some really nice features and tight solid construction. The controls are intuitive and usable, its nav system works great and the feature set is impressive. Comfort is a real drawback. The seats are good, but rear seating is cramped and there is limited cargo space. Space in the front seats is limited as well, with none of the little cubby holes and slots I am used to seeing in well designed cars. The ride is one word - punishing. You will feel every bounce and bump in the road. Pass on the technology package, it is annoying, constantly beeping and interfering with your driving style. </TEXT>

<TEXT>2nd Infiniti. I had a 2007 G35X and absolutely loved it, but changed jobs and had to drive down the Turnpike every weekend and the drive wasn't so fun anymore. The FX performs and even drives like my G did, except it is a lot smoother. I really enjoy the IPOD interface. I agree with some of the bloggers about the 7speed transmission. I notice a slight hesitation when I am accelerating from 35 to 55 (very slight though). Having come from a G35, I find that I can't feel 80mph when driving... the car is that smooth. I purchased the NAV,Premium, Deluxe touring and enjoy the 360 cameras. Test drove the BMW and was very disappointed with drive and available technology features - Germans need help!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like the 09 MUCH better than my old 04! Smoother quieter ride with a much more refined interior (definitely the nicest interior of any car I've owned; including 3 Acura's and 2 other Infiniti's). I think the exterior styling is an improvement and think it looks good. I prefer the new "wavey" grill to the old "dimpled" grill. Its definitely not the plain vanilla car most folks drive (how many RXs are there on the road?). Mileage is OK (about what I expected); I am puzzled by a previous reviewer giving a 20.2 average mpg a rating of only 5? Infiniti has the nicest most compact key fobs on the market - great for guys who hate a lot of stuff in their pockets. A great fun to drive car!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Technology is as useful as it is amazing; All-Around View, w/ sonar system, is very useful (easiest car to park I've owned), excellent Nav system (that I like better than Acura's), I like the safety aspect of having LDW, IBA/FCW, and DCA, and the Intelligent (laser) Cruise in nice.

<TEXT>My first Infiniti and I am impressed in almost every way. The car is almost great. The all around view camera is amazing and surprisingly useful. I opted away from the Tech. package because I found it very annoying. Only complaints: 1) On most roads the ride is good but on some rough aggregate roads it is both noisy and a little rough. 2) Transmission is a little slow to downshift for passing. Not bad, but not that good either. Overall gas mileage has been 20.2 thru 2300 miles. Overall I think it is a very good and sporty ride and I found it to be very comfortable during a 600 mile day of driving. Limited interior storage and space needs to be considered closely. Buy it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Replaced my 2005 FX 35 when the lease expired with the new 09. Great SUV with the deluxe and premium packages that have the 20 inch wheels. It is certainly an upgrade from the 05 with nicer interior and better ride. It seems that there is more leg room in the front in the 09. In city driving the 7 speed transmission seems to change frequently but on the hwy it is really smooth. This would be my only complaint.</TEXT>

<TEXT>FX35 AWD 2009 Platinum Graphite/graphite with Premium, Navigation, splash guards, illuminated step. For the price, this SUV has superb value and retains most of the excitement of a G35/M35 while increasing refinement and space. Rides smooth and solid, like a tank on rollers and is amazingly agile for its size. Fits 4 adults perfectly. Classy yet contemporary interior is intuitive and instantly driver friendly. Advanced technology such as 360* view cameras, fast navigation, powerful speakers, and smart lighting makes for a convenient and practical ride. 7 gears makes for better mileage and efficiency.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1. Backup and 360* cameras, absolutely needed for SUVs 2. 303HP engine that roars when needed, silky smooth when cruising 3. Keyless 4. Fold in both side mirrors with a touch of a button 5. 4 level adjustable headlight height 6. Great colors and interior lighting 7. 7 gears 8. Cooling seats</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our 3rd FX35 since 2003, our 8th Infiniti overall since then. This blows away my 2003 and 2007 FX35. However, two issues that they fell asleep on. They took away the compass on the mirror, and the compact flash reads some things and misses others. No current support on that issue. The compass was useful when navigation did not have an address in its database. Now, forced to look at the little compass on the nav screen and figure out which way you headed. It takes a few seconds to figure it out when you could just look at your mirror and see the direction by letters. The cd harddrive takes forever to copy songs into memory, basically useless. Compact flash very picky and fussy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bose sound system is outstanding. Dashboard illumination is tops. Air/heated seats. All around camera.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded a 2005 FX35 for a 2009 FX35. Got all the bells and whistles with this new model. I love (most) everything about the car and generally agree with all of the posts here; however, there is one thing that is a negative. The front seats are quite a bit HARDER than the old model. I believe the seats had to be redesigned to provide for their new airflow. They are a bit like slightly uncomfortable shoes. If I were younger (I'm 45) I would not have noticed; however, the older one gets, the more things, in general, become uncomfortable! I still love this car. The seats are my only gripe!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Lease ended on my 07 M35, and went for the new 2009 FX35. Got the Premium Package , Nav Package and Technology Package. Did not get the 20" wheel package. The 20s still make the car ride too rough and cost a lot more to replace than the 18s . Really like all the improvements in the car. The ride is 100% better than the previous model and even quieter than my 07 M35. It still is a bit rough if you are into a Lexus cush, but I think a lot of folks will like the balance of sport and lux. Tech features are amazing and really work!! A lot of this will become standard in the future on all cars. Check it out!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the high tech safety features on the tech package. Nice nav upgrades from previous version. Nicer leather than before (softer quilting is worth the $).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded my 2006 Acura MDX for 2009 FX35. Tried 2009 MDX- didn't like it. FX drives almost like a sports car, not like an SUV. Great handling, nav. system and back up camera are beyond belief, great leg room. Exterior is unbelievable, looks very aggressive. In my opinion, FX beats MDX hands down, except, of course, for the utility part. Luggage room is practically non-existent. Two weeks ago I drove six people and 5 suitcases in my MDX. Definitely won't be able to do it in FX. Other than that it's an unbelievable vehicle!</TEXT>

<TEXT> I had the 2003 FX35 and I loved it. So I just had to have 2009. I like the improved interior and the new look, but the ride is still hard. My main problem is the 7-speed transmission. The car only accelerates smoothly when rapidly accelerating. Accelerating from about 25 mph or 45 mph is awful. It never seems to know what to shift in too. It?s a nightmare when driving in traffic because it keeps downshifting and then it lags when it should up shift. I end up using the paddle shifters to make the trans do what it should be doing on its own. I was thinking it was only my car and maybe something is wrong with my trans, but I see that someone else had the same issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a replacement of my 2005 FX35, which I liked this has improved comfort, seats and ride. My main problem is the awful 7-speed transmission, badly programmed. This is supposed to be a sporty car. The car only accelerates smoothly when rapidly accelerating. Accelerating from about 25 mph or 45 mph requires full accelerator to get a downshift or nothing happens quickly. Around those speeds the transmission can?t seem to make up its mind and makes it hard to maintain a constant speed with frequent downshifting. I have never owned a car with such inconsistent throttle response.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this vehicle!! I test drove every SUV on the market before buying this one. I drove the Porsche, Benz, the Toyota, Lexus, Ford, Dodge, and the BMW. None compare with the comfort and goodies that come with this one. Did I say I love it?? I owned a BMW X5 before buying this vehicle and there is no comparison in the ride, feel and comfort. This vehicle is by far the most outstanding of all the SUVs on the market. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my 2003 fully loaded FX35 for the 2009 with everything except for DVD this time. Like others wasn't crazy about looks such as grille and new color choices but, my Mojave Cooper w/mad-frown and wide arched hood has really grown on me. The DCA technology is the most impressive, actually pushes back off gas pedal and applies brakes when it detects a car in front, even in stop and go traffic. Other music and nav tech features are really fun. I don't understand how they made it faster and yet get slightly better MPG too, have not averaged below 20 yet after 2K miles. Braking and handling has also improved much over my 2003. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded a 2005 FX35 for the 2009 FX35. At first I wasn't crazy about the looks but the much improved interior and ride comfort outweighed appearance. Now after having the car a month I really think it's cool. I really loved my 2005 and would have kept it had Infiniti not made such great improvements.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Happy FX owner</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I am a previous FX-35 owner. I recently upgraded to the 2009 version. The ride is MUCH smoother compared to the previous model. The technological advances are amazing. The navigation system is better than Lexus. The radio is fantastic, including the iPod interface allowing you to fully manipulate the iPod using the Infiniti screen. The tip-tronic shift system is fun to use. You can use the stick shift or the paddles next to the wheel to up shift and down shift. The interior and dash board are much nicer now. I highly recommend the navigation system and the Technology package. The dynamic cruise control is very useful. I would VERY highly recommend this car, no questions asked. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>iPod controller, dynamic Cruise control, tiptronic shifter via shift stick or steering wheel paddles, dashboard with multiple colors not just yellow, heated and cooled seats, lane departure system actually helps to compensate for poor attention span, all-around camera view is very helpful</FAVORITE>
