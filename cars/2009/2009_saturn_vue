<AUTHOR>New Saturn Owner</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Forced to trade in my 99 Durango Cash4Clunkers after getting rear-ended and getting more damage than 'Ol Reliable was worth. After shopping ALL crossovers except for the Mazdas (ran out of time and the dealers were running out of inventory), I settled on V6 Saturn Vue FWD. 2000 miles into it, I've found: 1) It is very attractive on outside; 2) Very attractive on inside 3) Plenty of power in a small ride 3) Plenty of cargo and room for 5. 4) Transmission timing seems rought in 2nd gear 5) Gas mileage is not that great. Around 20-22 MPG, mix town/hiway. 6) Remain convinced that I got the best deal on wheels at the time. All in for about $22,600 after clunker and dealer cash.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Vue after 4 months of researching SUV's. Having owned a 2001 Saturn SL1 I wanted to test drive the Vue. I'm sure glad I did. My wife swears by her Mazda Tribute, but she quickly fell in love with the Vue. Fun to drive, ample power. Driver cockpit/instrument set up is great. Above all, I love the looks. All my neighbors can't believe their eyes when they see its a saturn. Fuel economy could be better, but nothing is ever perfect. Bravo Saturn.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Radio, power drivers seat, fun to drive, MP3 player jack.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Vue is fun to drive. I recently took it up mountains with three passengers. The V-6 with the manual mode shift made the drive easy work and fun. The car has excellent control to hug the curves and ample power to negotiate the inclines.The features including On-Star Directions and Connections and the satellite radio added to the driving pleasure. The fuel economy is still somewhat disappointing, but the car is not yet broken in. I would not hesitate to recommend either the 4 cylinder or V-6. Fred Saunders </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Six speed manual shift, satellite radio and On-Star. The styling is attractive. The features are all great on the X-R.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Happy So Far</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>For price, feel as though VUE offers fantastic value. Possesses numerous amenities which adds to quality of driving. 4 cylinder has lots of pep and enough power. Been getting 28.5 MPG mostly highway and still breaking in. Stability Track & ABS efficient- did not skid out when I had to jam on brakes. Car very fun to drive, great mover and does not feel light like a tin can . Feel safe when driving. Owned other crossovers, tested competition, and found VUE to offer most gadgets, style, value and performance. Very pleased so far w/ first Saturn. Must say, great experience with dealership and they offer comp car washes and donuts.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Aesthetically stylish, sporty and sophisticated. Car offers great value and luxe amenities ( Hands free calling, built in Universal Remote-eliminates separate gate and garage opener) for price. Feel very safe with On Star. Interior roomy, spacious cargo area. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We shopped all over for a nice vehicle and we found the Saturn Vue V6. The vehicle was maxed with factory options imaginable, except factory Navigation. First of all I need to say the vehicle looks just fantastic and the ride is good. The auto was in the shop 6 times within the last year for torn seats, side seat supports breaking twice, loud noise coming from the engine and it was the A/C clutch in the engine area. We also had the OnStar service 3 times because when we added more minutes to the phone OnStar deleted our service...Yipes! XM radio was also updated. We wanted to consolidate and trade in 2 vehicles to get a single one. OnStar does not refund, XM Radio does not refund...</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM Radio, OnStar and V6 had lots of power.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the looks and amenities of my Vue. This is my second Saturn, my first was a 2007 Vue Hybrid. But the AWD has 600 extra pounds and 70 more horsepower. It will make a big difference winters. The ride is very assuring, plenty of power for passing and hills. The interior is very classy. And I really like the curves of the body shape. My one reservation is the seating. I am a large guy, and the seats are uncomfortable after just a few minutes. The seat hinge and the hanger that the seat cushion support hangs off of cause a degee of discomfort. Perhaps as everything wears in that will abate. But the seat depth is to short, I could use another inch or two.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sunroof, styling and power.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this Vue last month and I am not happy with it at all. Within two weeks of getting it (brand new) the stabilitrak lights came on and needed to be serviced. They said it was a loose fuse. They supposedly fixed it. A week later it popped back on. Now they don't know what the problem is. I have to wait until it happens again and spend 2 more hours at the facility to get it fixed.The bluetooth is a pain. People are having problems hearing me and the clock disappears when I'm on it. But what's even worse, is the cupholders! They are fixed in a way that they are so far down and blocked that you have to pull cups from the top and it spills your drinks. and two cups will not fit in there.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The outside is pretty. Seats adjust well. Great for taller or bigger people.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Excellent exterior styling, very much like a Lexus RX330. Interior well laid out, comfortable, and quiet. Like the climate controls - even though not dual-zone, can set temperature. Lots of room. Mechanically, the vehicle performs very well - hybrid action almost unnoticeable. Only indication really is a sense of background "braking" as the energy recovery system kicks in on some deceleration, though that is not objectionable in the least. Acceleration is very good, especially for a 4-cyl. Sound system is excellent (love the satellite radio). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The mileage will save us a bundle as we put 20,000+ miles on per year. Compared to the minivan it replaced, its a miser on gas, but still lots of room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my third Saturn and first SUV. I test drove 10 or more SUV's and came back to trusty Saturn, (this is my third one!) I love my dealer and drove over 70 miles to buy from them. I saw reports that the interior stains easily and I don't keep cars nice and I have no problems with the interior. My dealer gave me some of the stain fighter they use! The steering feels like a car, very manueverable, the seats are wide and comfy. I can fit alot of junk in it! Love the XM and free Onstar. All of my Saturns have had great maintenance records. Love Love Love my VUE! Join our Club, if you want a great vehicle and super dealer staff!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my Chevy Tahoe for a Saturn Vue. I wanted something smaller and more economical which I got. Overall, I am satisfied with the vehicle but have some complaints. The windows and/or sun roof cannot be opened without dealing with an excrutiating & painful vacuum feeling on your head and ears. Feels like you are going to be sucked right out of the car. Steerling wheel needs to be tilted down further. Seats are very uncomfortable. Seats and carpets stain very easily. Dust & dirt accumulate quickly on dash and in cup holders. No passenger unlock button for doors. Cup holders in an awkward position. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my Lexus RX 330 about 2 weeks ago for the Vue Redline. While the quality of the interior materials cannot compare - the Vue certainly did put the fun back in my commute. The Vue is sporty to drive, quick response, easy to maneuver(u turns, tight parking spots). The interior headroom is better than my RX, but the front legroom is a little tight. Sales experience was good, financing with incentives made it easy. Hopefully the quality holds up and I'll be driving my Vue for many years. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the exterior styling and sporty (quiet) ride, compact size, rain sensor windshield wipers/auto headlights, Onstar, MP3 jack, sport shift. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I researched and evaluated lots of different vehicles before settling on the VUE. I was deciding in between a pre-owned Lexus or Mercedes when I saw a Red Line VUE drive close to my home. I couldn't believe it was a Saturn! It had the looks of an European vehicle. I went the next day and test drove a VUE and was hooked. Put this vehicle on the list! Plus with O% APR for 60 months-- an easy choice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Standard bluetooth, standard heated seats, standard leather seats with suede-- the Redline is the way to go. Also love the On-star and the Satellite Radio.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Nice looking outside, OK inside. Seats stain very easily, and are a bit narrow. The seat back cushion feels like a large lump for support. The electronic temp gauges taking a while to change from cold to hot & vice versa. Lights in console and dial gauges a strange yellow color, not pleasing to the eyes. Additionally the console gauges seem to be tipped upwards a bit, so if you sit low and back they are not straight on. Plastic around ateering wheel column rubs when turning wheel. Not enough legroom up front. I am 5'10", and could not stretch out legs on long drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>On-Star, peppy v6, good visibility</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was ready to purchase an SUV, looking for just the right fit. After testing out 3 other versions of the compact SUV's I found what I wanted. The 4 cyl has plenty of power and so far after 2 weeks, the mileage is fine. Averaging 22 MPG even with a heavy foot. With this model and features I didn't have to settle, I got what I wanted and enjoy the XM radio, & OnStar features. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cargo netting, radio, OnStar, especially the Manual shifting. Have not had a chance to experience the stability traction feature (hope I don't have too), but if I do I feel safe in knowing I have it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I fell in love when I drove my sister's 07' Vue and counted the days till I could get my own. The V6 has tons of power and it handles well. So far I'm getting about 18.6 miles per gallon and I'm happy with that. The XM radio is addicting and makes long drives nice. You can't go wrong with this SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first look, always the looks. First drive was... 1) solid vehicle 2) impressive power 3) I like it 4) how much is this? 5) looked at Mazda CX-7 (no turbo for me) 6) Honda? Looks cheap. walked away 7) Nissan Murano? nice but too expensive What a joy! I will stay "American Made" if they produce vehicles like this!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride is great. Better than an Escape by any measure.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My Vue has excellent performance and handling so feels like a sports luxury vehicle to me. The fit and finish is great and the interior is spacious for my family with two young boys!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior and exterior design, the high performance engine, the Stabilitrack which works like 4-wheel drive in the snow, the excellent sound system, and the smooth shifting transaxle along with the firm 4-wheel disc brakes.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only driven my new '09 VUE XE enough to exhaust a single tank of gas, but my satisfaction with this car warrants some serious praise. The upscale Euro styling, both inside and out, is simply unmatched within this price range. Fit, finish and interior materials truly are class-leading. The ride is solid, quiet, and smooth. I choose the 2.4L based on both cost and fuel economy and don't regret the decision. While the 4 won't win you any races, it's more than adequate for both city and freeway driving. I moved from a Chevy Trailblazer to the VUE and would trade the refinement of this ride over the TB's power any day.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, ride quality. Very well equipped even on base model. German engineering on a budget. Price with incentives is very competitive. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Reliable cars fan</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have been a fan of Japanese cars because of the look and reliability. American cars always looked bulky and dated. Not this one. I had 2 Hondas and a Mitsubishi before. I was coming out of a Honda Pilot lease and wanted a smaller SUV. I was going to lease either a Nissan Rogue or a Subaru Forester. The Nissan dealer offered a special lease on the Rogue. On my way to sign the lease, I decided to stop and see the new Vue and check out the GM incentives. The minute I checked out the Vue, I fell in love with it. Loved the exterior and the interior. It looked very well made with no cheap material anywhere. First tank city driving car mileage with some AC use is 19.86 MPG.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything. When I test drove the V4 and the V6, I liked the V4 better (XE-2.4L). The total incentives to buy this car was $5500 off the sticker price ($1500 of which was because I was coming out off a lease) I bought the car right away. Now after a week of driving it, I am still very impressed</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought our '05 Vue new four years ago and when it came time for a new car we wanted nothing else. Our old one had zero problems with it and had 78k on the odometer. We brought our new '09 Vue home and just love it. We couldn't be happier. The build quality is dramatically better as is the comfort and interior trims. The old one was good, but this one is great. This is our third purchase from a Saturn dealer and the buying experience is always easy and hassle-free. Saturns have many nice options are included in the package price of the car. We don't have to add on much at all if anything. Will definitely purchase a Saturn again and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to buy a new SUV</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the seats. Love the new interior. Really love the chrome trim and roof rails. Just a nice-looking car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Although I'm a confirmed Honda guy, I decided to test drive the 2009 Saturn Vue XR -- what a surprise! This car looks great and drives even better. It's solid as a rock with better steering response that the three BMWs I've owned. I needed a car that is flat towable behind our motor home, so I compared Honda CR-V, Ford Escape, and the Saturn Vue. The Vue won out and I've been very pleased with it so far.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very strong V6 engine and precise steering, Bluetooth hands-free phone capability, and XM radio. Also, the Vue has a 5-year, 100,000 mile power train warranty -- better than Honda.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought a Saturn Vue Hybrid recently. I only have about 1300 miles on it so far. I like the auto engine stop when the car stops. I like the quick re- start. It happens so smoothly that you hardly know it. I needed an SUV for camping and bad roads, but didn't want the bad mileage of other SUVS. This car has done well no bad roads and also gets good mileage. 28 MPG on the first tank. 29 on the second tank (including some back roads). 30 on the third tank. It is light at about 3,800 pounds. Has a useable area behind the second row of seats. Has a bigger back seat than the Escape or many other small SUVs. Unlike many hybrids, this does well on the freeway. Great car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very good mileage for an SUV. Good interior space. Like OnStar. I like buying American cars.</FAVORITE>
