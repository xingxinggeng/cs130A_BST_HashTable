<TEXT>Being price conscious we opted for the CE model. It has all the features we need. We didn't need a van when our children were young, but need it for the grandchildren. Two weeks after we purchased the van, we took a 2000 mile road trip. That was when we truly fell in love with this van. We grew to appreciate the comfort of the seats and the handling of the van. It is amazingly easy to park and gets adequate mileage on a trip. We got 26- 28 mpg on a trip. In town we get an average of 20 mpg. We keep wondering why we didn't get a Sienna years ago!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The deep well behind the third seat is perfect for groceries so they can't roll all over. The sliding doors are a plus in a crowded parking lot when buckling the grandchildren. All the seats are so plush, and adults can sit comfortably in every seat with leg room to spare, even the third row seat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the best vehicle that I have ever had. It is very comfortable and a joy to drive. There is plenty of room to carry things. I wish I had it when my kids were in college to haul many pairs of shoes. It gets good mileage on the highway but not so good in town, however I drove a PT Cruiser for a few days and only got 2 MPG better mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just passed six months of ownership. Van drives great-- smooth acceleration, supple ride, excellent turning radius and decent sight lines. Drivers seat not as comfortable/adjustable as I would've expected. Interior engineered well with lots of storage. Intuitive HVAC. I sprung for the JBL Synthesis system and I am disappointed with the sound. Not nearly as good as other premium set-ups I've had. Otherwise, very happy with the van so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the vehicle to replace an older Sienna. We have driven it more than 17,000 miles and have had no issues with the van. Good acceleration, comfortable on long trips and great mileage (as much as 26+ on a 1800 mile trip). We like the bluetooth and navigation system, backup camera and automatic side doors and rear gate. Smooth and comfortable ride with great turning radius. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Multiple use navigation system, backup camera and automatic rear gate. Comfortable seats and great space.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased a new van so that my wife and kids would not have to deal with all the aches associated with an old car. We live in So Cal where the summer temps go over 100 deg. The A/C on the van has stopped blowing cold air on 5 separate occasions. This happens either when stopped or driving so it's not even a consistent problem. We take it to the dealer and they say they can't find anything wrong with it. I had previously purchased a Camry with NO problems. Thinking Toyota was more reliable I purchased this car for my wife and it was a BAD mistake. Next time I will go with a Honda for the family van.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very roomy, great middle seat in second row if you have infant. The seat can be moved towards the front or back with ease. Great feature for family with infants and toddlers. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my third van (the other two were a Ford and an Olds) and the Toyota is definitely the best riding. Build quality is excellent and the engine very smooth and powerful. At this point I have no complaints, but have high expectations based on Toyota's reputation. Will keep you updated. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just found out my AC condenser leaked all the freon due to a stone impact. The openings in the front grille measure two inches by three- quarters of an inch. This design allows stones to impact the condenser directly behind the grille. The $1300 repair cost should be covered under warranty, but it's NOT!!!! I bought a new car so that I wouldn't have to pay for these kind of repair costs. Buyer beware.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We love our van. I had a hard time getting past the van stigma but once I did I would never go back. This car is so practical. We have kids, and the room and comfort of this car is amazing. It drives so smoothly. It is so much fun to drive this van. The automatic doors is a huge plus. I always worried about the kids hitting other cars when they opened the doors. You can close/open the doors from the inside of the van. This car is made for families. Toyota did a great job designing this car with so many family friendly features.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the 2009 LE recently and took on a 1,500 mile round trip. Highway only mileage was 26 mpg and 27 mpg on consecutive fill ups. Mixed mileage has been roughly 19-20 mpg. Seats are extremely comfortable on a long drive. No rattles, no squeaks, no blemishes on finishes or rough edges. Power doors are very easy to use as are the middle row seats to tumble and the back seats to fold into the floor. The back storage well is huge and swallows gear and upright suitcases. Gauges are easy to read with one exception. I am six foot three and cannot see the top portion of the speedometer even with a movable steering wheel. Great highway cruiser and super easy to handle, does not wander.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our 2009 Sienna is everything we had hoped for and then some. For the first 16,000 miles we have averaged 22 MPG - not bad for a big car that drives so easily. This is also the first car we have ever owned that has not needed a repair for some sort of flaw. It has been perfect in every respect and we are beginning to wonder if the 100K extended warranty was worth the extra cost.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We live in New England. AWD was important to us in purchasing this van. Also the crash test results and the awesome reliability record of this van was the deciding factors for us. The gas mileage is not the best, as noted by several reviewers here. But you have to consider that this is a large vehicle with a large V6 engine AS WELL AS AWD option. The AWD adds 2 or 3 hundred pounds to the weight of the vehicle. The gas mileage will suffer. If you want higher mileage, you can go with the FWD option, or get a smaller vehicle. The vehicles drives beautifully, it has a tighter turning radius than most mid-size sedans, it is relatively quiet on the road, and handles well for a minivan.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power sliding doors and hatch, grocery hooks in the hatch, fold down rear seats, flip up middle row seats, awesome stereo (optional), DVD player (optional), leather upholstery, bluetooth, LOTS of storage and cup holders, access to the middle and rear seats, roll-down windows on the sliding doors</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Open the door on the Sienna and you are in for a shock. The XLE with leather interior looks as good as any luxury car on the market no matter what you spend. The next surprise is the performance . . . awesome! This 266 hp V6 would blow away 90% of the guys next to you that think they have hot cars. Highway acceleration is every bit as impressive. Ride will match nearly anything on the market. The turning radius is mind-blowing. The negative: Visibility stinks; I've almost had a few accidents! Hood must be propped open to stay up! How cheap on a $30K plus car! Tranny shifts a bit hard at times and has minor surges. Paint chips easily. Needs pinstripe or something to jazz up the outside.</TEXT>

<TEXT>From the moment my wife and I drove the new van we were completely hooked... it drives really smooth and effortlessly. I am really surprised and happy at how well the dealership has been since we purchased the vehicle and could not be more satisfied with the sales staff. We have five children and the vehicle is very durable and spacious for the kids, and the rear compartment is extremely valuable with all of its room for storage. The dvd and sound system is amazing, love the comfortable seats and leg room in the interior. The van controls are really easy and my wife became very comfortable with them quite quickly. Overall this van is a solid 9.5 out of 10. Would recommend van to anybody.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Simple features are the key. Easy to use radio, cd, dvd, and a/c controls. Great rear a/c controls as well. Sliding doors are a life saver. Sound system. Roll down sliding door windows. Power rear window vents. Alloy wheels. Center console. Love the large amount of storage bins and rear cup holders.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought my 2009 Sienna LE in Dec 2008 in Orange, CA. Everything is good, drive smooth, roomy, comft. However shortly after driving, I start to hear engine humming noise, sometimes loud, sometimes not there. Happening specially at acceleration. My friend's 2007 has similar problem, others on Edmunds Discussion site mentioned same problem. Any of you seen this problem?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am happy with my new Sienna. I had a 530xi BMW before this and before my BMW had an Odyssey. The Honda was too loud and felt big for me to consider this time. I was choosing between the Sienna or Enclave or Highlander. The van handles well. I would like for it to have a little more power too, but is enough for most people. I am a bit concerned about the automatic passenger doors. They have not stopped when something has been in the way. A friend of mine just purchased a Sienna because she liked hers so much and showed the kids how the door was supposed to retract and it didn't and she injured her hand... make sure you try this feature out at the dealership. Gas mileage not great.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>New Sienna Owner</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I purchased my new Sienna LE about two weeks ago. I needed a safe, comfortable, reliable and good looking van to carry my family. I got all of that ? plus a surprise ? great gas mileage. The overhead multi-info display was showing an average of 27 mpg while driving on the freeway but I expected it was lower. It turned out to be 25.7 mpg from fill-up to fill- up. The interior trim looks beautiful. A road I must pass over every day has lots of potholes and patches. My other vehicle rattles like crazy over this area but the Sienna does not make a sound and stays in complete control. All-in-all, a great vehicle and a great value.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The six-disc CD changer on the standard radio was a surprise. I expected a single disc like the van I turned in. I can keep all of my CD?s in the radio and not have to flip any in or out. There is even an input for an MP3 player! The mid-seat captain chairs are very comfortable. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just traded in our '03 Odyssey EX-L w/DVD for an '09 Sienna XLE w/ DVD & leather + xtras. I thought my Odyssey was the ultimate family friendly car but this is even better. The Sienna is very well thought out with lots of storage compartments scattered about. Very easy for 3rd row passengers to get into with tumble-forward 2nd row seats. The drive is very smooth and car like. With the Ody, I often felt there was a huge amount of car behind me. The Sienna is a significantly quieter inside than the Ody. All the seats are very comfortable. I really like the center console in the front row - it has a deep center storage bin that is perfect for the DVD headphones.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sonar parking assist, power rear hatch, auxiliary input for ipod, 3-zone A/C, all the storage cubbies! Shopping bag hooks in trunk, bluetooth, integrated sunshades for 2nd/3rd row, ability to store 3rd row without removing headrests.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First time minivan owner. I am very pleased with how the vehicle drives. It really feels like you are driving a car. The acceleration is acceptable, and feels sure taking corners. The amenities in the limited are substantial. The sound quality of the bluetooth technology is good. The nav system is not as intuitive as you would like, but I can live with that. The sound system is strong. The back up camera gives you a little more confidence when backing up. My two biggest complaints are the gas mileage (getting about 15 mpg which has some city, but mostly highway miles), and the side doors not stopping when something is in the way.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Sienna! My friends can't believe that I traded in my BMW M3 for a minivan. Being a mom, family safety and comfort was at the forefront of my decision but I started to really like the aesthetics of the minivan. I was surprised at the turn radius and also the pep. I have to say that I cannot live without the remote sliding doors/trunk, AWD, DVD, and rear camera. I've been trading in my old Siennas for a new one every 2 years or so because I love them so much (not because I've had any problems with them). I keep changing colors and haven't yet decided which is my favorite yet. I love the AWD and run flat tires (makes me feel safer with the family on board).</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Great Famly Car</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>This is a great family car. It fits me, my wife, two kids and my in-laws. Go skiing a lot in Vermont. Drive frequently from NYC to Vermont. This is an amazing car in the snow (AWD option). The gas mileage is pretty bad, 16 miles per gallon. But, considering the size, seating capacity, and AWD, it's pretty good. I got the LE AWD no frills version and bought aftermarket leather seats. I recommend this minivan above all especially living in the northeast. I almost never plow or shovel my driveway. In 2 feet of snow, this baby comes in/out of garage like NOTHING!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased my new mini-van yesterday. What a blast. I only have about 30 miles on the van at this point. The location of the instrument panel is ergonomically excellent. The option package is awesome, but requires some study to operate with aplomb. The interior looks Rolls like in quality; and fit and finish. The exterior styling is good but no match for the interior's Rolls look. The engine is more than adequate and powerful, and matches the transmission which is smooth as silk. I was really surprised by the tight turning radius of the vehicle. When driving this van, I automatically think I am in a luxury automobile costing tens of thousands more than the actual cost.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is difficult to pick out a favorite feature, when it is how this vehicle makes you feel by its very essence. That is it. My favorite feature is the essence of the mini-van. The total package is my favorite feature. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just traded in our 07 Odyssey EXL-RES after 1 years use for the AWD option on the Sienna. We have approx. 500 miles on the Sienna. Over all the Sienna instrumentation/controls are much more intuitive, hated the Ody instr. Ody felt big and bulky but did give a very comfortable ride. Sienna's ride is a bit stiffer but much more responsive, gives the driver a better feel of control and is quite comfortable. Very good visibility. Heat on our Sienna is very poor in cold weather (>32F) and never seems to get comfortable in cold. We do all short hop drives and expected poor mileage but our 14 MPG is a bit ridiculous. Hope this will change after the break-in. Would not go back to the Odyssey.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased a 2009 Sienna XLE in October. I never thought to ask if it was winterized. With the first dusting of snow I skidded around, and found out the antilock brakes do work. My windows are frozen shut, it is 20 degrees here, but will be getting much colder. So I came home and got into my 13 yr old Ford Windstar, that I did not slide and the windows are not frozen, even though it too is sitting outside. I guess the all "season tires" that are OE need replaced for the winter. And I will have to be sure it is winterized. The dealers said you can't special order. It seems that for $30,000 you shouldn't have to "settle</TEXT>

<TEXT>We looked at a lot of competitors, 3- row suvs, and felt this gave us the best compromise of function, mileage, features. It is a quiet, nicely put together ride. It came with the features (DVD, leather, power everything) we wanted. If you have kids and take frequent road trips, this is the way to go. We drove the Nissan, Honda (3x), had a Ford (loud), Mazda5, and checked out the Hyundai but felt this was the way to go after researching and testing. I really liked the Mazda5 but with 2 kids and 1 on the way, we decided a "full-size" minivan is what we needed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1) Dealer-installed DVD player/quiet ride. When the kids are watching a DVD using headphones, parents can actually talk. 2) Power doors/hatch. Crazy how lazy you get after getting used to it. 3) Storage areas, like the one in the door armrest.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>On a whim, I decided to see about upgrading our 2007 XLE with limited features to a fully loaded 2009 XLE. We lucked out and got a good deal on both the new van and a trade in. There are minor differences to performance which is nice. However,the upgrades are amazing and so worth it. I am loving my van. And the gas mileage is better on the new van than the 2007.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After researching the Honda Odyssey and the Sienna, we decided on the Sienna. Just crossed the 1000+ mile mark and had the first oil change. Great ride from a 300 mile round trip with 4 people and loaded van. Mileage is in the 23 mpg range for combined driving. We also bought the extended warranty (too many electronic features with navi / DVD / rear camera / sensors that can go wrong) and the maintenance until 55k.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2009 Toyota Sienna a few days ago and already put 200 miles on it. I love driving it, it is very comfortable both the ride and all the seats. The power of the 3.5L V6 is amazing for being in such a big van. I have 200 miles on my van and i just got to a half tank, the engine is not yet broken in yet. The DVD player is clear and it comes with an awesome JBL sound system. I would recommend the Sienna over any minivan. It comes standard with the Toyota Star Safety System, which has VSC, Traction control, ABS, Brake assist, and 7 standard airbags. Go look at one, you won't be disappointed.</TEXT>
