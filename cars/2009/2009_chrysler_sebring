<TEXT>We purchased the 09 Sebring Sedan, Limited. It has all the options that are available. Unlike Edmund's review, we found this car beautiful inside and out. The seats are soft leather. I could find nothing that looks cheap or of poor quality. We have had several complements in regards to the style and accessories. Prior to this purchase we test drove six other cars. The Sebring was the most fun and best looking. It reminds me of a grown up Crossfire. The sound system is fantastic. The GPS, radio, CD, Telephone are operated from a touch screen. Easy to learn. The V6 is responsive and fast enough. The gas mileage isn't as good as the Ford Focus but we are pleased with 27 mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style,18" wheels, remote start, heated leather seats, moon roof, sound system, dual exhaust system, color of interior leather, hot and cold cup holder, trunk space. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I tested a number of cars including Camry, Accord, Ford Fusion, Merc Milano, Volvo S40,and a couple more, this was the smoothest quietest of all. There's a couple minor blips in the paint, but car looks great, with lots of leg room in the front. After driving a Mountaineer for the last 7 years, it's like riding in a much larger luxury car and feels like a much bigger car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stereo, 17 inch alloy wheels, free Sirius for a year, large trunk, very cool interior lighting, non-digital gauges, general exterior appearance.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> the moment I saw the car I loved it,I trade it with 1998 crown vic,the total was less than $14000. After I bought the cars,I read many many bad things and revies about it,but I found out non of them true,and it's not fair for a good American made car. The warranty is unbelievable,life time on Engin and Transmition,gas mlg is more than great,the design is wonderful,I read some reviews suggested poor built quality,I don't know about that yet,the car is new now,but I am positive that many years to come will prove it's not true either. It's a good car,warth what I paid for</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The shape of the car. The warranty on the car. The price. very comfortable. smooth drive and quit. gas mlg amazing. Safety</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First-the bad news: if you are looking to lay down 10 second runs at the track or turn heads at the valet then this isn't the car for you. That being said - I challenge you to find a roomier, more equipped, more fuel efficient, smoother riding vehicle than the '09 Sebring Sedan. Traded a clunker in w 200K miles and with all rebates,discounts, +ttf walked out the door with a 2.7 V6, Nav/Sirius Sat Radio, MyGig/DVD System, Power Sunroof, Heated/Power Seats, Hot/Cold Cup Holder, & Remote Start for $19K. Those same options on any other car puts you well over $30K all without the lifetime powertrain warranty. Put 100 miles on it the first day testing out the Navi!!! BTW - I'm 6'4-</TEXT>

<TEXT>There was not a touring 2.7 listed but that is what I got and what a good motor for the car. I can't believe the gas mileage I am getting, way better than listed. On the highway at 65 to 70 miles per hour I get 33 miles per gallon. It has all the bells and whistles, some I will never use. It is comfortable for my wife and me to travel in. The motor is responsive for getting on and off the freeway and passing. The gas mileage is reasonable and we are averaging 28 miles per gallon. The radio sound is excellent for a car. We both like it. I have has the undecarage done, rust inhibiters, cloth stain proofed and paint protected. Now the car must respond.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system, tire pressure monitor, gas mileage indicator, adjustable power seats, comfortable seats, good cargo area with separator, great engine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have truly fallen for my sebring. Never had been a fan before having only experienced the convertibles in the past. It drives so smooth and has decent pick up. The look is sharp and it is very comfortable. I do feel it is "simple" in the interior department - not many bells and whistles. Having said all of this, I did not pay full price for it either. I was able to get it for under $14k during the cash for clunkers/double rebate from Chrysler. I do not know if I would have paid $20k for it. Only time will tell.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth ride, large trunk, comfortable leather seats, good gas mileage</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>i am over 6ft tall try to find a convertible that you can stretch out in and be comfortable at my height i previously owned 2 passats and there is a huge quality of interior ,sheet metal,and paint difference, but having said that it is very appealing to look at and gets great reviewns from passengers and onlookers,just don't look for a tight german ride.the car does everything well enough and the top comes down,nothing better on a summer day</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this sedan after looking at and test driving Honda Accords, Pontiac G6s, Dodge Chargers. Despite what professional reviewers say this car has a great look on the outside and inside. The inside is kinda a art deco look and just feels.. classy. the 4 cylinder is not going to slam you into the seats but it has respectable power and handling. If you are looking to buy American and get a good looking car that gets great gas mileage, look no further.</TEXT>

<TEXT> I have driven both this model and the one it replaces and it seems the quality does down while the usability goes up. This is one of the worst cars I have ever driven and am ashamed to call it an American car. Chrysler should really think about doing the honorable thing and just putting itself (and our taxes) out of it misery. Drive quality = F, Confort = F Build = F. The plastic on the inside likes like it was spray painted with cheap rattle can paint and it chips off with a light fingernail. you need a phd to get the top down, the heater is too hot or too cold. the seats are terrible and there is no back seat. Don't buy this car</TEXT>
