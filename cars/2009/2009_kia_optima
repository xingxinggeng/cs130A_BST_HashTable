<TEXT>I had a 2007 Mustang for 3 years but after many issues and the warreny being up at that time 11 days. I was thinking of trading..found Kia for another car but ended up buying Kia Optima. The car is very good car over all but the seats are so hard and not comfortable at all. My back hurts after drving the car. I would advise really drving the car for more then a short test drive. I did drive the car 3 times however a really long drive would be better. I try to hurry up and get to where I need to go so I want have to drive the car long. The only plus is the safety/warrenty and the radio is good other then that I wish I never got this car. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Best Kia So Far.</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I got this car for $17500 and im very happy with it, i've had it for 5 months and it has yet to break down or need work. I have 8500 miles on it and everything still seems like new! I wish Kia and Hyundai would replace the 2.7 V6, its underpowered (190 hp) and bad on gas for the power (20 city and 26 highway)! They should replace it with a 3.2 V6, more power for same fuel economy! The I-4 is enough its not that sporty but its Kia what do u suspect? I get 32mpg on the highway and 25 in the city, great milege. Kia did a great job with the design! Very modern. It was between the 09 Fusion, 09 G6, or the Optima, Optima won! Its a good deal go out and I strongly suggest you put this on your list.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>- The I-4 with 174 hp is very nice. it has decent power and is very efficent. - Safety Equipment is very good. - Backseat is very nice and big. - I love the Style very modern! - The Brown is nice against all the chrome!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Nabbed this Midnight Blue MT baby 10 days ago and am in love with it! Researched for months to narrow my search; thought I'd opt for a Honda Fit or a Scion XB as I wanted utility, cargo room and decent mileage. But when I realized this was the only car under $20k with standard stability control, traction control and disc brakes on all wheels I was sold. The 10 year warranty and $2k rebate were icing on the cake. Amazing what comes standard on this 'base' model! Almost bought the smaller Elantra but figured the Optima's extra HP and larger engine with only a 1 to 2 mpg penalty was well worth the minor price difference. Excellent gearing + short throw 5 speed = FUN RIDE!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent acceleration! Side mirror turn signals are over the top! Blown away by all the standard features on this 'base' model. Grateful for all the airbags, traction control, stability control & disc brakes on all wheels. Nice that split folding rear seat is also standard. Serius radio=nice touch.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I never thought I would buy a kia product but I am glad I did. I hit a home run, when I purchased my Kia Optima. This vehicle is much better than the Accord or Camery. I have owned both other vehicles and there is no comparison. The warranty and safety is 3 times better. I only paid $13,9000 (new) and I jump on the deal. This has got to be the best deal I have ever made on a vehicle. Last I would say this vehicle is so under-rated. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my new Kia in August and even as a former Toyota Camry Driver, I absolutely love it! The price was right and I am constantly turning heads in my new black Kia. I feel like I have one up on the Camry and Honda drivers. The drive is nice, the car is roomy, great on mileage and highly rated for safety. This was the best purchase I could have made.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am 60 and cars have always been a hobby of mine. I decided to trade in my HHR due to rusting and other problems. I have looked at many cars and drove several and I like this car over the camry and accord, witch cost 10000 more comparably equipped. I chose the SX 4cyl model and so far I am totally delighted. Who knows what the future brings but so far excellent! I never thought I would buy a Kia but, I have to say they have come a long way.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation, voice command driven radio and navigation, excellent interior, heated seats, auto dimming mirrors heated mirrors, very modern styling. It actually came with extra lugnuts!! 10 year warranty</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Before I purchased my Optima I had a 2008 Kia Spectra in which was a great car. When I traded in I had 47k miles no problem what so ever. I went to the dealership to get an oil change when I saw that 2009 Optima Midnight Blue and it was love at first sight. The price, style and performance are great. First look at this car and you would say that's a car that is in the 30k range. My optima was in the low 20's and with the rebates and the fact that I was a current Kia owner that made the rebates even greater. I would say Kia is my car of chose hands down. Kia keep on keeping on.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>LONG TIME KIA FAN!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Had for 6 months and have put 4,000 miles on it. Had a 2006 sportage and saw the optima and had to have it. I am blown away at the attention it gets. People are always telling me they love its looks and the red color is sharp. I just smile when I pull up beside a accord or Camry and think to myself I saved thousands and have an equal car. The optima feels smooth and plenty of power from the I-4 it only has a few less horse power than the v-6, save a few bucks and buy the I-4. The trunk really holds a lot and the car is comfortable on long trips. The gas mileage is as advertised which many cars do not match up. So we are very pleased. We do recommend kia to everyone we know.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking to replace my wifes car and not sure what with. Had a mini van and wanted something with better gas mileage alone with a little more comfort. looked at Subru, Nissan, Honda, Toyota, Chevy and Ford. I am 6'4" Kia had the most leg room front and back. Great comfort and great pep out of a four cylinder. Nicely equipped in standard options. To early to say how well it will last but I would say it will out last just by the feel of engine tranny (5 speed auto) that this car will out last any American four cylinder out there. 175 hp not bad at all for a 4 banger. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove an Accord, Camry Mercedes just to name a few. I drove an Optima and was totally blown away. I would have picked them over the others any but when you throw in the cost it is truly unbelievable. This car has everything you can imagine as options, has road manners that of an Accord. I drove a camry (32,000) comparably equipped. The only thing the kia didn't have was a 3yr, 36000 warranty. The Kia has a 5yr 60000 bumper to bumper and 10 yer 100000 warranty! Very happy!. Cost 20,150</TEXT>

<TEXT>As soon as I got home, the trunk release button on the door already quit working. The headlights never worked but the high beam headlights. Took it back to the dealer the next day, they couldn't tell why or what is causing the problems. I was told to bring it back next week and leave it for someone else to diagnose the problems. If you or someone you know is looking for a car, please take my advice and stay away from a Kia dealership. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is a pleasure to drive. Solid road manners, quiet along normal paved surfaces, decent accelaration, most luxury features available for the money. It is very stylish, more reminiscent of an Infiniti or Acura vehicle. The build quality of Kia is higher than previously expected. The speedodmeter reads to 160 mph and may reach 140-150 mph given the gearing & feel of it's accelaration if it is not speed governed. I ordered mine and received it with 4 miles total. I have been happy every since.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power everything stand on this model. Windows, doors, both front seats, auto- dimming compass mirror; paddle shifters, audio & cruise controls all on steering wheel. Satellite radio. My black optima came with chrome door handles, window trim, and most exterior trim. 225/50R17 tires with alloy rims</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a keeper. Rides great, great gas mileage at 34 HW, low initial cost, low insurance premiums, sharp looking, great lines, best color combination (Ruby red, w/charcoal interior), turns heads everywhere I go. Nobody can believe this is an Optima. Ever seen the old styles? Those things were ghastly. This one looks nothing like them from any angle. I intended to buy another Rio, but when I spotted this Optima, it was case closed. MPG is about the same as the Rio, but the car has way more charm. Love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got tired of buying premium gas required for my Dodge and sought a new car. Having owned a couple of Kia Rio's I thought Kia might have a deal in progress. When I spotted the '09 Optima, I was sold. New sleek lines, great price/rebates, 100K warranty, large interior, great acoustics, decent acceleration for a four banger. I began using premium and got 36 miles to a gallon on the highway. I eventually switched to regular and get 34 mpg. The Rio's cost 2 grand less and get 37 mpg. Bigger car, more options, excellent gas mileage. I run about 4,000 miles a month and the 2 grand over the Rio was worth every dime. Turns heads everywhere. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cruise control, ABS, Stability control, tilt telescopic wheel, steering wheel audio controls, ash tray, appearance, spacious trunk, ample back seats, headlights that throw light way down the road, visbility, this car has it all.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Very very nice midsize sedan. I was looking to replace my wife's car and the Optima was the clear winner. We looked at Camry, Malibu, Elantra & Accord and the Optima was the winner based on features, styling and price. The $5000 mark down we got really helped. The Metallic Bronze is a head turner in the sun and we like the interior and exterior styling. We also have a Borrego and Kia has done their homework; clean conservative styling and nice standard features. Great basic features, great styling, very roomy cabin and a great value. We would highly recommend the Optima for "The family 4 door sedan". </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought car 3 wks ago after buying a Sorento I had 8 wks. This car was suggested by dealership. I highway miles a day so I'm a bit dissapointed. My kids are a bit tight w/ 2 boosters & a 13 yr old in back, but it's doable and he can buckle ok. The side mirrors are rectangular & takes getting use to, don't feel like I always get good coverage. Power's good & handles huge daily hill ok. The material is CHEAP & pills (balls up on seats). I'll be investing in seat covers! Got silver & it hides dirt well, looks sharp. Happy w/ purchase, wish I had electric seats/sunroof but was upside down & couldn't afford more. overall I dig it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MP3 outlet, Serius radio (only 3 months though), looks SHARP in Silver! (I tinted windows too - very nice!), radio & cruise on steering wheel, glove box bigger then Sorento, good interior & trunk lighting, no attena to deal with, feels sturdy and safe. Overall GREAT car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently purchased a 2009 Kia Optima and I'm totally having a ball driving it. I looked at Toyota, Chevrolet, Mercury and Nissan. I could not have afford all the extras I have with my Kia. Its metal bronze color which looks different in various lights sun cloudy etc. I have a moon roof and really nice leather. Awesome sound Infinity 6 speakers and 6 cd changer plus satellite radio. Heated front seats plus all the equipment that comes standard for about 10k less then the other cars. Also have 5 year road side assist and warranty. Thank you Kia</TEXT>

<TEXT>I never would have bought anything but a Honda or a Toyota. I was so biased against Kia that I wouldn't even look at their features. Then I was driving past the Kia dealership, and a car caught my eye - the redesigned 2009 Optima EX V6 in Metal Bronze! I stopped, took a test drive, and was completely AMAZED! Kia made the redesigned Optima look like a real competitor, and my car turns heads! I am shocked at the power from the small V6, better gas mileage than my Honda, better warranty, and it was surprisingly inexpensive for the features. I can't wait till the dealership installs my OEM navigation system! For being a Kia hater, I now wouldn't drive anything else. Kia's slogan definitely true!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sharp edgy original exterior styling, the solid feeling of shutting the door (feels very quality) LOVE the lumbar support, very safe car, inexpensive, awesome sound system, powerful and fuel efficient engine, leather feels high quality, Sirius is really nice, the color is different and looks great!!</FAVORITE>
