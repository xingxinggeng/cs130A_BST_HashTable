<TEXT>I bought this car because of it's looks. But was disappointed by the performance. The brakes are super sensitive and it jerks when braking and my back hurts every time. Poor visibility for a short person. Very bad on ice and slick roads. In real life look can be deceiving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my 2009 Altima for 7 months now. I love to drive it. It is such a fun good looking car. It drives and handles well, but it does have some exterior engine noise that could be looked into. Interior room needs a little expanding. They could have taken some of that trunk and given more leg room for backseat passengers. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature is the keyless remote. I love not having to look for keys. I also like the style of the car. It is good looking and fun.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When accelerating the car hesitates significantly. This happens primarily in going from slower to faster speeds and around 2000rpm. Then when you give it a touch more gas, it takes off. It borders on being dangerous. I'm currently trying to get Nissan to recognize that there is an issue. I feel like I'm getting the run around.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new Nissan. I purchased the Nissan Altima 3.5Se with the premium package. The car is super fast. The pickup is amazing. The seats are comfortable. The backseat is huge. Enough room for 3 adult size kids. The car is quiet. The controls are easy to handle. The gas mileage could be better. The car still rides like a dream and worth the extra in premium gas. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle a couple of weeks ago and absolutely love it. I have the 2.5SL with every option except Navi. It is extremely comfortable and fun to drive. My first tank of gas I averaged 26 mpg and that is local driving. This is my 5th new car in 4 years and I finally found one I will keep!!!! I test drove the Optima, Accord, Sonata, Camry, several Crossovers, this won hands down. I would recommend this car very highly. The sales people and finance people at Mitchell Nissan on Enterprise AL are the best.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this car in June 09 been back to the dealer 3 times for a service engine light code. They say that the code is the evap sys. but cannot find any leaks. Had an 04 Nissan sedan prior to this and never had a problem. The 09 Nissan Coupe is very stylish on the outside but the interior is cheesy and the stereo speakers already buzz, and the road noise is terrible. Very disappointed with the overall build quality. As usual you pay more ,and get less. This is my wife's car and she says it is fun to drive. I drive an 04 Chevy colorado pu and it is quieter than the Nissan. Do yourself a favor buy American!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car is great. Looks really good. Like it in Silver the best. Handles pretty well. Lots of packages ..conv, conv plus and connection package. Looking forward to better reliability than I had with my Olds Alero v6. That was a fun car to drive, but too many issues with the head gasket leaking! Now I have a 4cylinder, but I am liking it. Coupe should have lights/design that sedan has! Love radio but does need quicker way to get from low #'d station to higher without having to hold down seek and wait. Also, brakes are a bit touchy. Steering seems to not want to center for some reason. Wind noise is really loud with windows down on faster drive..super loud. Key fab buttons look alike</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>intelligent Key is great. never use the keys! Interior is beautiful. Exterior beautiful. Drive is fun. Peppy ride most of the time. Love the dash and all the features. Love the Bose radio and compartments and push button start. the manual shifting option is good too. Adds to the experience.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This coupe is a fine-looking car. I got the Slate color, which is a really nice and elegant color, looks much better than white. Classy car that looks sporty without hanging a silly spoiler on the trunk. Have gotten lots of compliments on its looks. Have not seen another of these coupes on the road, although have seen the Infiniti G37 couple, which looks just about the same but costs about twice as much. This car is a very good value for the money. Car handles well, giving a sporty drive while keeping good road feel. Comfortable to drive. I am well satisfied with my first Nissan.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Have come to appreciate the keyless ignition and the CVT. Tried using the alternate pseudo-manual transmission but it got me about 5 mpg less than CVT, which gives me about 30 mpg around town. Interior is simple, easy to understand and use. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Nissan Altima</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have owned a new 2009 Nissan Altima for a little less than 5 months. And I find the push-button ignition very unreliable. On three different occasions now, I just could not start the car. I took it into the dealer. I was told that they changed the codes.It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it is most aggravating. Tonight, I waited in the dark for the Auto Club after trying more than a half hour to start it. Finally, the push button ignition connected and I called the Auto Club to cancel service. I know that you have to push on the brake pedal to get it started and I have done this repeatedly without success. Is there a sure-fire way to start this car? Please tell me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at the Accord and the Camry to measure up against the Altima. I believe all three of those cars are comparable. The main selling point to go with the Altima was the look of the car. I have received many compliments on the car that I do not believe I would receive had I bought either of the other two cars. Aside from the looks, this car has been fantastic. The fuel economy has been amazing, do not believe any review that tells you otherwise. The handling and the comfort of the Altima has met and exceeded our expectations. Nissan has done a fantastic job with this car and we couldn't be happier with a purchase. Kudos Nissan, great job! You have earned a long time customer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Brought home a second Altima (2009 2.5) in less than a year to join the 2008 3.5 sibling at home! We love these cars! Great handling, good acceleration and power, even in the I4! Got our 3.5 after testing 4 and the 2.5 after testing 6 (each time visiting 3 dealers). Learned something very valuable -- out-of-round tires cause bad vibrations/shimmy! (Result of sitting in one spot on the lot too long -- a year or so. Permanently damages the steel belt radials -- you need new tires.) Also, discovered that cars made in Canton (rather than Smyrna) seem to be better -- quieter engines and superior quality parts such as knobs/trim. Must be the QA program Canton established after a bad start.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the cornering -- "on rails" -- and the CVT that gives you power without sounding like a lawn mower. Seats are comfy and trip computer on the dash display alternating with temperature, mpg, etc is convenient. Home link / dimming mirror with compass is an essential tool you'll want and enjoy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car in June 09 but it was an 08 left over from the previous year. I paid 21,500 including ttl. They gave me and awesome deal and I loved the service. It has great pick up and no can pass me up. Has good traction and excellent features. It could more cushy seats, but they are ok. The only thing worng is that the right wiper doesnt work right. So I am going to take it to get the wiper replaced. But as far as a v6 it is an awesome car. Better than Toyota and Honda. Another thing I noticed that was fishy was that the gap between the passenger door and the back passenger side door has a larger gap between them than the opposite side. Same with gaps on the hood sides</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had the car for two months and water has entered on the drivers side. Although the dealer is attempting to determine the cause and will fix under the warranty, I now worry whether there has been any damage to the wiring or computer systems most critical to this vehicle, as the water has entered up under the dash. Particularly, the keyless starting system and the possible rust to the floor boards due to the amount of water that has been deposited since I do not know how much water has entered the car. I am retired and have not driven much and there have been at least 4 heavy rains. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 4Runner thinking that I would get better fuel efficiency based on the advertised 23/31 mpg. It's giving a dismal 18 mpg in the city and a pathetic 20.5 mpg combined. And yes it is the 4 cylinder 2.5S. My 4Runner was giving me just a mile or two less with a 6 cylinder engine! Besides the poor fuel efficiency it's a decent car but if you are looking for better mileage, look elsewhere. My last Nissan purchase!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got the 2.5SL with the nav package. I'm very happy with the car. I love the CVT - very responsive and smoother than the 07 loaner the dealer gave me while waiting for my car. Car is fun to drive, and has a surprising amount of power for a 4 cyl - made me forget about not being able to get the V6. I average about 27-29 mpg in suburban traffic. It stinks that stability and traction control are only available in the V6 cyl. My other big gripe is the radio that comes with the nav package. Could be MUCH better. Sounds good though Overall, this is the best car I've bought to date. I enjoy driving it and it has a smooth and quiet ride. Engine can be a little noisy when revved though.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT - awesome transmission period - smooth and powerful Engine - good mix of power and efficiency Body - sporty look with the spoiler GPS - does a good job overall but comes up with crazy routings sometimes Ride - smooth and quiet</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got the SL package on my 2.5S and am only mildly content with the performance vs. options compromise I chose. Having only owned previous 8 cyl. cars (Last was a Continental), the change to 4cyl has been an adjustment to say the least. Ride is great, styling and value are better than Accd/Camry/Mazda6. Power is acceptable; but, wish I got the 6cyl. Still think the mileage for either is great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride & styling! Electronic key. Sounds silly, but I think my rear spoiler sets the car apart...I like that I was able to get one. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first foreign vehicle. I have been a " Ford Guy " since I started to drive 32 years ago. I tried Honda, Toyota and Nissan is my choice. This car is fun to drive and the gas mileage is unreal. I get on average 31 mpg. I am 6'3" and I have plenty of head and leg room. There is also plenty of room for 3 average adults in the back seat also. No need for the 6 cyl for power, just take the 4 cyl first and give it a try. Much better gas mileage also. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the Key Fob feature, you never need to take it out of your pocket to open doors, or start the motor. This car drives like a sports car. Tight on turns and it has plenty of get up and go. I also think the CVT transmission is smooth operating. You can't even feel it shifting through the gears. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove this car, the Toyota Corolla S, and the Honda Accord Coupe. I liked the Altima the best because it was a bit smaller than the Accord, and felt a bit more sporty. Simplicity also comes to mind. The doors felt sturdy and the rear of the car is very attractive. I think the headlights need a bit more work though (needs to be more like the 370z). I wish there were LED tail lights as well. It would also be nice if there was a remote trunk release. My 1999 Nissan Maxima has folding side mirrors, so why is this feature NOT included on a 2009 4-cylinder model (it is standard on the V6 model)? Overall very nice car, but has the potential to squash the competition with some adjustments.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT was smooth, and I liked the simplicity of the interior compared to the flight control layout of the Accord Coupe. Push button start is a nice high end feature. The car accelerated rather quickly. Best fuel efficiency in its class, which is very important to me. I recommend this vehicle. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First car I have ever bought on my own. I was looking at the Honda accord coupe gti and and civic si, being that I am 26 I didn't want a " boy racer" so it came down to the altima and accord. The accord is a little bigger, but the altima drives like it weighs nothing and the look of the altima surpasses the accord hands down. Love the cockpit of a drivers seat love this car</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car! I was undecided between the Altima and the Malibu and after test driving both of these cars I fell in love with the Altima! It has so much more room and it drives so much smoother then the Malibu! I'm so pleased with my final decision! Also, you can also use the Altima as a standard or an automatic vehicle. I don't know how to drive a standard but my boyfriend loves that we have that extra feature in the car! The push start button is amazing because when I leave work my hands are always so full so I've always had to dig for my keys and now I don't have to! This is a really amazing car and I'm so pleased that I chose the NISSAN ALTIMA!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The intelligent key is the best feature! Its really nice if you have children and you can't really dig for your keys! As long as this key is in your pocket or your purse you can push the button on this door handle and it unlocks! No key needed! And there's also a button to start the car inside!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was in the market for a new car and after reading reviews and test driving a lot of cars, the Nissan Altima was my eventual choice. First the good - great power for a 4-cyl and great gas mileage. Interior is plain but functional. Very stylish. But now the bad. After 1 week of driving - A LOT of vibrations in the floor and pedals from the road. It is to the point now that my feet physically hurt if I operate the car for more than 20 minutes. According to 2 different Nissan mechanics, this is "perfectly normal" and "why the car is so cheap." I don't consider $24K to be cheap and I certainly don't expect any car to operate like this one. This purchase is a regrettable one for sure.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm what you could consider a hesitant buyer, someone who may spend a year researching and test driving vehicles before committing to buy. As a long- time Honda owner (I still own an Odyssey), the Accord was my initial favorite, but I've researched and test drove most of the competition as well. These are all excellent cars. While I cannot claim that the Altima is the better car, it had enough features I liked to win me over. I owned it for almost 3 months now and I am still excited every morning when I get into it. Since the Accord was my initial choice, I'm listing below the features of the Altima that won me over. What I liked in the competition is listed as suggested improvements.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We shopped this primarily against the Honda Accord Coupe and are very glad that we went with the Altima. After about 30 days of ownership, car is exceeding our expectations. Price paid is also a big plus since we were able to negotiate a total of almost $5k off the sticker price of $28.2k. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've test driven almost any mid-size family sedan on the market and that's what I can say about Nissan Altima. Compared with others in its class, Nissan is noisy. Its engines (both 2.5 and 3.5L) produce, on average, 10-15HP more than the competition but at what cost!!! Engine noise beyond 2000RPM is excessive! At par with Suzuki I've driven the other day (yes, it's that bad)!!! On the positive side, the exterior and interior design is fantastic. No nonsense or extra not needed buttons. Everything is ergonomically laid out and easy to use. CVT is the biggest and unique feature about this car though (surprisingly) it's not as smooth as it seems. You just touch the gas slightly and it jolts.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This new Altima is a very nice car. I sold a '96 that just wore out after 215000 miles. I always buy Nissan, as they are $2 to 5k cheaper than Toyota and the fit, finish and quality are comparable. I love this car and it is fun to drive. Love the Keyless entry and push button starter. Trunk is very nice. All around, I think this car, in Dark slate and charcoal interior looks very classy, and can compete with next model up lines. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior and exterior are beautiful. I look at those that bought entry-level BMW's for $35k and think this car is every bit as good, for $17k. Like the Aux input for the MP3 players. Good sounding audio system. CVT transmission is really fun to drive. Manual for fun, Auto for cruising. Buy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is the best...I love it!! Sporty looks, nice colors to choose from, love the keyless entry/start, storage, cup holders, auto windows up/down & more, the 4 cyl has plenty of pep and I feel like I have a little bit of a luxury vehicle but at a great price! I compared to Honda Accord but it was kind of boring...I just kept thinkin about the Altima and I'm so happy I went with my gut feeling and chose this over the Honda. I have a child so needed a sedan for practical reasons, but I still wanted something a lil sporty too and this is it..the two pipes out the back add to the fun look and I got the rear spoiler which is nice. Only wish I could get the fog lights.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty looks, keyless entry/start, auto windows up, can play my IPOD through radio, the backseat also has armrest with cup holders, plenty of storage, front armrest slides forward to accommodate us short people who may have to have our seat up a bit! Love it all!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 2009 Altima replaced my 2002 Altima 2.5S, which logged 165,000 without any problems. I just figured that time would catch up with the '02, so I traded when the promotional financing made sense. I put lots of highway miles on my cars, and often drive deep into Mexico, e.g., Acapulco, so comfort, fuel economy, and RELIABILITY are top concerns of mine. Luckily, the Altima offers all that along with a beautiful body.</TEXT>

I spent 17k for a car that is loaded with features. My primary concern was saftey and size. The car is again is perfect, not too big not too small. Fun to drive great looks, great value. Very happy with the price and purchase experience.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Really like the looks campared to other cars in its class. Smooth ride. Nice power</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my 2.5SL for over a month. So far I am getting on average 30mpg. The car is very quiet and handles really well. The sound system is ok, could be improved. (I did not get the Bose) The exterior look sharp. Plenty of room for 4 passengers. I am 6'1'' and find the drivers seat somewhat uncomfortable. I am still trying to play with the 8 way adjustable seat to figure out how to get comfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Couldn't be happier with my Altima purchase! Traded "up" from a '03 BMW 525. Got all the luxuries PLUS in the 2.5 SL (loaded except nav.) that I had in the Beemer... much more room, updated interior and accessories, better mpg, regular gas(yes!), etc. I loved the look when saw others on the road, and once I test drove and saw price, amenities, available options, colors, etc... I was sold!!! Already have over 10k miles (100+ mile commute each day) and still rides/looks/smells like new. Would definitely recommend to others. Love the look, ride (smooooooth), interior, trunk room, mpg (avg 30-32 combined! -- but mostly highway), Bluetooth, AUX input on Bose stereo.... and list goes on.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Same as above... plus very comfortable ride, smooth shifting with CVT, extremely quiet interior even at highway speeds, keyless entry/start button, storage space/cubbies galore, and more.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned the car for just over two months now, and am completely satisfied with my purchase. Mixed highway and city driving gives 27-30 mpg (over 4000+ miles so far). The ride is smooth, the car is comfortable, and I love the way it looks and handles. Passengers have commented on how well it rides and how it looks. It is a quiet car even at highway speed. Another reviewer complained about the sound of the turn signal; I think it's so quiet I have to visually check to see that it's actually on. Keyless entry/push button start takes some adjustment, but is very convenient. Good A/C and stereo with the convenience package. Absolutely no doubts or regrets to this point.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the back end design, love the interior. Much sportier to drive than the Camry in my opinion, and it seems to be a nicer interior. CVT takes a little getting used to, but is ultimately smoother than a traditional transmission, especially when needing power at highway speed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I switched from the Murano (which I loved)to the Altima, due to gas prices. I avg.30.5 per gal. and can't believe how far I can go on a full tank. I do miss the storage room, although it's generally good. The nav stinks compared to a Garmin at a fraction of the price. The design of the black console is just ok. On long drives my leg leans against the center console and becomes uncomfortable. Generally though, it's a nice drive. The car should have a rear wiper.It does have a Great sound system.</TEXT>

Fuel economy around town is about the same as my accord. I like driving this car around town. I don't think it compares to the Accord on the highway. The Accord drove itself, this car, I have to steer too much. I don't care for the way the Altima handles on the open road. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Got it loaded minus nav. Only owned the car for a week with almost 200 on the clock. The ride is wonderful and the power is exceptional. It feels very athletic yet has the capabilities for a family car that I was looking for. I rated it slightly lower on build and reliability because I already have a squeak by the back seat and a strange clank in the engine compartment by the driver's side firewall. Almost sounds like some spring mechanism resetting. It only does it after each start up after cooling down when you are just starting to drive off. Very strange. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my vehicle for 1000 miles now and I am very happy with it. I looked at a variety of cars: used Acura TL, new Acura TSX, Mazda 3 (2010) and a Ford Edge. The Altima SL CVT with Bose is very comparable to the TSX but has a better body style and was thousands cheaper. The voice activation blue-tooth phone is very very cool! Wish the 2.5 had a few more horses for when the car has 4 passengers, but it is sufficient. You can always step up to the 3.5 if needed for a couple grand. It also fits 5 passengers very comfortably.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted to wait until the I had some time with the car before I gave my review. All i can say is that I really enjoy driving this car. The engine is sweet and quite responsive around town and on the highway. The gas mileage is where I though it would be (average 26 in mixed driving) and it has been increasing with each tank. No car is perfect, but the SL has all the features I was looking for at a price that did't leave me car poor at the end of the month. I test drove all the competition...Fusion, Accord, Camry, Malibu, Mazda6....and I kept coming back to the Altima. I'm glad I did.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased this car for my wife, we researched and test drove the Camry, Fusion, and Mazda6 as well but selected the Altima. It has what we felt was the best finishing details/trim and was sportier than the Camry and Fussion. The Mazda6 was a close 2nd place but our local dealer didn't have much of a selection. We have owned Mazda 626 and a Camry in the past and really like both of them, but the Altima just fit our needs better this time. Probably a little more in price when equipped comparably, but worth the extra $$. We love it so far.</TEXT>

Nissan thought of everything in designing and building this fantastic car. The engine has been rated as one of the top ten engines in the world for the past 14 years ! The CVT automatic transmission is regarded as the best transmission in the Auto industry. A warning to Honda + Toyota: you had better step up your game and quit relying on your reputation because you getting left far behind!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Took our new Altima SL on its first out of town trip. Very uncomfortable passenger seating, especially the poorly designed front passenger seat. The seat is only 8" from the floor, and seat dimensions are too small for someone over 5'10". Unfortunately, we spent too much time worrying about engine performance and options, and the test drive was not long enough to focus on this serious problem. We bought this for in town driving (which is fine), and for some out of town trips. It is physically painful to ride more than an hour. Very disappointed -- wish we had stayed with a slightly less responsive, and a little more boring Accord or Camry that we considered. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my SE coupe two weeks ago and love everything about it: The V6 is smooth and powerful. It handles extremely well, has great styling, and a well laid-out comfortable interior. I love the bluetooth hands-free (really necessary with a stick-shift), and the Bose stereo is definitely worth every penny!. On top of all that, I beat the Edmunds TMV price by $600 without even haggling with the dealer. A previous reviewer was comparing this car with an Accord coupe and was wondering if Nissan is as reliable as Honda. I say every bit! My trade was a 1995 200SX with 241K miles and it never needed any major repairs! Hope this one does that well!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The V6 has excellent power and has a nice subdued growl that it makes when accelerating. The bluetooth hands- free works well. The Bose stereo upgrade is worth every penny! The xenon headlights really light up those dark country roads at night. I love the styling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>To say that I am happy with my Nissan Altima would be an understatement. This vehicle replaced a 2006 Murano. It has everything I could want... and more. My car comes with Bluetooth, which is easy to use and it actually understands me! I don't have the optional Navigation system, but there is a convenient compartment with electrical to plug in my portable Nuvi. My Altima only has 4 cylinders, but I have no problem with acceleration onto the expressway. My only regret is that I am leasing. If I had known how happy I would be, I would have bought it.</TEXT>

I don't know if this is my doing or not, but my breaks are already squeaking (?!) Breaking is not as tight as I would like but steering and maneuvering is fun, esp. for its size. Engine is loud but it's not a bad thing in my opinion. It's pretty easy to parallel park. Center console is nicely set up (and BOSE rocksss) but knobs do seem a little cheap. Back seat is smaller than other cars in its class. Trunk is huge. Sharp car for young people and/or those who want an affordable fun car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was out looking for a new family car after selling my sports car from my little girl being born. I looked at several other brands but also at the Sentra. I found the Altima to be big enough on the inside for the large rear facing car seat we had trouble fitting in other vehicles. The steering response on the vehicle is great, I get an average of combined 26 mpg. The car feels peppy for the 4cyl and the CVT is very smooth. Interior materials seem of good quality and buttons and knobs are conveniently placed. Standard all disc brakes and ABS is a nice feature and the safety features cant be beat. Great 5 star safety ratings. Its the highest in its class. I also really like the exterior looks.</TEXT>

I will update my review to include whatever needs to be updated at that time. So far I love the car. It looks great both interior and exterior and more importantly, it runs GREAT! The CVT is weird at first but is actually pretty neat. It is one factor that gives this car great mpg. The push to start is another neat perk. The car rides smooth, runs very quiet, and has a good load of features fro the price.

The engine has a lot of power (100hp more), sounds great, the car has a more solid feel, and is just tons more fun to drive! The black leather interior is very stylish and comfortable. So far nothing is rattling. The CVT and overall ride are very smooth. There are some quirks to the car, like if I press the Bluetooth buttons on the steering wheel hard, the horn beeps, and it feels like it is engine braking more than it should when I take my foot off the gas, but they don't bother me too much (yet).</TEXT>

I'm having buyers remorse after 5 minutes off the lot! - my 2002 Camry can do 5000 or 7500 miles between old changes, the Altima is ~3500 miles. The CVT is what sold me.

Real big trunk and glove box to store items. Every time I drive it I feel real safe, I love the intel key and push button start. It has real good MPG too. I would recommend this car to anyone. GO NISSAN! :D</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT, push button start, Intel key, glove box, big trunk, center console, tail lights, smooth look, MPG, roomy cabin, smooth ride, sound system, safety features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned the car for about 3 weeks and so far I like the car. You can pretty much figure the cars reliability will be great (its a Nissan!), interior styling is very nice and exterior styling is great. For the price is really is the best deal on the road. I have gotten 27 MPG mixed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior and exterior styling, gas mileage, interior room.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car. It has great looks, ride, and mileage. I tested the Accord and Mazda6 and the Altima was a better car for me. I still don't understand why no lumbar support for the drivers 6way on the S series and why 9 cup holder?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The CVT is way cool</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you are looking for an outstanding car for the price, comfort, features, power, build quality, style (compare style with Infiniti G (Infiniti is Nissan)), and great fuel economy, then this is the car that you want. Freeway - average 35-40+ mpg, city - average 25-29. Professional, sporty, and not pretentious. Every time I see, get in and drive my car, I know I made the right decision. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I got the base model 2.5 CVT, everything is great. Love the keyless entry and push button ignition.</FAVORITE>
