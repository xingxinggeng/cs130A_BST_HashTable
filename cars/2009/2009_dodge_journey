<TEXT>my brake pads and rotors went at 16,500 miles. Both front rotors were warped causing me to need replacement. the dealer told me that there was nothing that they could do because the warranty was 12/12 on brakes. i called HQ and they said that until there is a recall I would have to pay for the repairs and that there was nothing that they could do for me. I was told by one of their mechanics that they are using inferior brake components to keep production costs down. If a recall comes out then I could get re- embursed for the brake job at that time. I am not going to buy out the lease now. They are getting this piece of crap back and going foreign. DON'T BUY THIS VEHICLE!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall we have really loved our journey. We purchased when they first came out and the first issues I had were the heat/radio/windows not working at random intervals (I would have to turn the car off and restart several times) The dealership couldn't find any problems with it. I also hear a weird noise when I make hard left turns and my dash vibrates when I go over 50 mph. The latest thing that makes me regret the purchase is that the front brakes/pads/rotors are completely shot and it only has 21k miles on it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has been nothing but a headache since a month after we purchased it. It had an axel seal to bust causing oil to leak on the exhaust, the transmission is always shifting gears, sometimes it wont shift down when going up hills, then when it does shift down it wont shift back up, it down shifts to low gear while in cruise control going 70 mph on the interstate & almost got us hit,Chrysler says that's the way the car is designed to work, power steering whins all the time, Chrysler says that is normal also. Any problem that this car has Chrysler says it is normal so it doesn't do any good to call them with your problems. All i can say is LEMON, this car should have been YELLOW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Probably one of the quietest cars in it's class. Stunning with the 19 in chrome wheels. More storage than I could ever use. I love the green LED floor board lights, handy if you drop something. A fun car to drive...love that Auto Stick...I'm used to rowing my own gears. Cool the way the middle seats pop up and forward out of the way. The wide opening door are great getting grandma in and out but you must watch the kids opening them to far in tight parking lots. Overall I love this car. Waiting for the Chrysler version.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my vehicle for approximately 11 months and my car has been in the shop more days than I can count. Everything that has been mentioned in the other negative reviews has happened to my vehicle. My car acts like it is going to die on a regular basis and the dealership cant find the problem. My radio decides to stop working for no reason. My strut tower was not bolted in. Nice workmanship!! My door locks decide when they will work. Some days the locks will work and some days they wont. I have nothing nice to say about the vehicle or the dealership!!! I do not feel safe driving this vehicle!! Stay away from the dodge product! </TEXT>

<TEXT>After having this vehicle for a few months, I really am not that excited over it anymore. Lots of interior fit/finish issues that lots of people having. The make-up mirrors on the visor, will be the first to break, very cheap. Watch out on your brakes, this vehicle will eat breaks in 10k, and warp the roters. I do work of a large rental car company, and they have major issues with this vehicle and its breaks. 19" Kumo tires, avoid the 19" option. The tires are cheap crap, went through 3, road hazards, thin sidewalls, soft tread, and you can't get the tires. Discount can get them, order only. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this vehicle for three months now and have had it on two long roadtrips. I get better gas mileage then posted. It is well built and very reliable. I have tried the safety features with almost getting in accidents while driving through Montreal Quebec of which were not my fault. I have owned 4 Chrysler Vehicles and have had no problems with any of them. If people would slow down and actually do the posted speed limit then maybe they would see better gas mileage. Everybody thinks that driving is a right, WELL IT'S NOT. Keep up the good work Dodge.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, we have had a fantastic experience with our Journey. One minor trim problem that was corrected quickly. Love the seating configuration for our five children. Easy access to back row. Comfortable ride. Plenty of power. Traded in my Grand Caravan for this. With luggage rack and lots of neat storage, we love it! The seats fold down easily for hauling all kinds of stuff. Be careful of 90° opening rear doors...tend to bang other cars in garage or parking lot. Love the Sirius radio and climate control! So much better than our Honda Odyssey (yes, I know...but we NEEDED one 8- passenger vehicle and the domestic options are so limited). LOVE this car! And out the door for $19000.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable driving position, handling, safety. Very well-thought- out features make it easy even for our kids to operate the seats (ages 5-14).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I researched the Journey for 2 months, it took me a few dealerships and a few weeks to finally get what I wanted. I have not had any major problems with the Journey as of yet, I do hear a weird sound when turning left but I have not addressed it yet with the dealership. I would like for the Low Fuel signal to tell me how many miles left till empty. I average about 18 mpg w/i city and have not taken a road trip as of yet. I enjoy the flex seating, the space is a bit cramped, but then again only my children will be sitting back there if needed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It drives really well, even though we took it in because the transmission can't always make up its mind what gear to be in on a slight upgrade. So far major disappointment with the gas mileage,only getting about 25 MPG on the highway not the 35 MPG its supposed to get. We asked about it at the dealership and were told the vehicle isn't broken in until its got 15,000 kilometers, which seems like an awful long time to brake in an engine. We got the journey because of its (rated) good gas mileage, so we are keeping our fingers crossed hoping it will improve in the next few months. After reading some of the other reviews we consider ourselves lucky.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought my Journey over a month ago. Love the way it looks, love the way it drives. got it in green. Everything works good , except for that strange noise that occurs when turning left. Went to the dealership and was told they haven't had any complaints about it. Not sure what it is but I sure hope my doesn't fall off. So far the gas mileage is good, but haven't taken a long trip yet. Not really loving the plastic interior though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>my wife loves the vehicle, but have had issue after issue since driving it off the lot. transmission rattles 35-50 MPH, it can't seem to find the right gear. almost feels like you're driving a standard shift while in the wrong gear. wheel and seats shake during acceleration. also had multiple oil leaks, pulling to the right, a brake problem, and multiple rattles. local dealers have been great and acknowledge the problems, but Chrysler has been useless. i feel like were the dodge test pilots. multiple visits and rentals are getting old. would not recommend buying this or any other Chrysler product until they learn how to treat there customers. have filed lemon law with local dealers help.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having put in over 8k miles in 3 months, I've come to intimately know my car (yeah 60 mile commutes to internship). It is overall a really great vehicle. Yes there are downsides, the third row is cramped, but to get a crossover with out that, Highlander, Flex, costs around 5 grand extra. For the money that the Journey costs, you get a lot of things no one else offers in the price range. The biggest downside I've found is fuel economy, but I chose to sacrifice it for the other features. Hybrid Highlander, near 40k, awesome, yes, worth 12k extra, no. I will say, cruise control is friend, it changes economy by 1.8 mpg on my experience (120miles/day), and instead of going 75, go 65, </TEXT>

There is TONS of storage, and the seats are SO easy to fold down or move if needed. The 90 degree open doors are great for getting in and out. The gas mileage is very good. This is SO MUCH better that a mini van! I have tons of people wanting to look in it and just wanting to "check" it out!</TEXT>

Check engine light has come on three times. The wire harness in my engine has been repaired. I've had three O2 sensors replaced and I've had continuous transmission problems that Chrysler engineers are supposedly working on. I got a lemon. I hate my vehicle. Don't buy dodge!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I live in my car. I love all the cubbyholes. I store my brochures & samples in the in-floor storage compartments. It keeps items safe & dry. There is plenty of room to take customers out to lunch. I have almost 14,000 miles on my Journey, and it has given me nothing but pleasure. My company pays for my gas so I am not always easy on the peddle. Surprising I have been averaging almost 22 MPG since the day I bought it. The only maintenance has been 2 oil changes and a tire rotation. I like the new automatic oil change indicator. It actually monitors my driving habits and the environment I drive in. My first oil change was at 5,111 miles and my 2nd at 11,008 miles. GREAT CAR!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love all the storage. It a salesman dream vehicle. Every morning I add a couple of waters or pops to the cool- zone for trips. It keeps them cool and ready to drink for hours.

<TEXT>As promised we were going to write another review of our Journey when we came back from our road trip. We went on a 8700 km (5400 mile) 10 state trip. We came back about 2 weeks ago . Our Journey now has over 17,000 km(11,00 miles on it.) To date we have had no problems with it! Everything is working great. Sorry to hear others are having problems with yours. Gas mileage was better than we expected, the seats were great, the a/c kept up to 106 degree Las Vegas temps, even with the 2.4 L it easily cruised the interstates at 70-75-80 mph. Only the steep hills of Colorado made the 4 cyl work really hard. We had already knew the 4 cyl version was a little underpowered though, so we expected it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The smooth quiet comfortable ride. We spent some 10-12 hour days in our Journey and none of us complained. Great job with low wind noise as well, We utilized every storage compartment that the Journey had. We love the black paint. We saw other Journey colors but still think black is the best. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Journey! This is our first crossover, moving up from a 4 dr car that just didn't have enough space with two car seats. I have 1500 miles on the odometer and average 22-23 mpg hwy, 19 city. Note that I accelerate slowly (don't get the RPM up to 3000 very often), coast when possible, use cruise, etc, to maximize fuel economy. If you like to rev it, don't expect to get great gas mileage. My 6'2" hubby and I (5'5") are both comfortable riding in this vehicle for extended periods. With the front seat pushed all the way back, there is still ample room for a toddler seat in the back. As for the blind spot, check your mirrors, turn and look, recheck mirrors, and it's not an issue.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Journey for 3 months and already have had the sunroof, power steering, transmission, and main wiring harnesses worked on. The oil light came on before 3000 miles and I got the recall about the wiring harness about the same time. I made an appointment and had the service department look to see why the car made a load noise when turning left. The Power steering was replaced and the transmission started slipping between 1st and 2nd gear also gets stuck in 5th gear and causes my mpg to be about 16.5. Now the the dealership is leaving it up to Chrysler to figure out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had mine for less than 4 months and it has been serviced 13 times and have been in the shop a total of 28 days (accumulative). It made a noise when turning left, which took them forever to figure out, the windshield made a buzzing sound on the interstate, the dashboard rattled, the back vents didn't work on low. So I have had a new power steering pump, new brakes, new shocks, new rotors, a new blower switch, 2 new cal panels, a part in the dashboard, a new air conditioning belt, and 5 new tires, which made the gas mileage worse. Heres the kicker, the steering wheel vibrates as well as the driver and passenger seat vibrates and they cannot fix it. DO not buy one of these. </TEXT>

<TEXT>On a road trip after purchase, got about 24-24 mpg on interstates. Running 19-20 in town. Biggest complaint is a mysterious roaring noise that occurs on acceleration in the 35-45 mph range. Dealer says it is an exhaust resonance issue that can't be fixed, but is common to the Chrysler 6-cyl. engine. My wife bought the vehicle and swears she would not have if the noise had occurred during the test drive. I think Chrysler should come up with a diagnosis and a fix, for what is otherwise an extremely good value for the price.</TEXT>

The DVD/Rear entertainment system was a lifesaver for our kids. Already had to replace the radio though. Not a big deal, just a couple hours in the shop. Still trying to figure out all the options that the radio has. Hopefully the updated CD we got in the mail this week fixes the problems we had with it.

My ESP (stabilizer) keeps coming on and I am getting a message to change the oil already, I only have 2650 miles on the car.I knew it was a risk buying a brand new model but my husband insisted we buy this because the gas mileage was supposed to be decent-I really wanted a Jeep before we saw the Journey.It is a nice looking vehicle and when it runs properly its great but I am concerned that there will be more trips to the dealer than we expected.</TEXT>

A/C acts crazy, makes funny air noises on take off and drain stopped up which flooded passenger floor on 6 hour trip. Transmission cannot find proper gear. 6 speed shifts up and down all the time, manual mode is a laugh. Tail pipe rubbing making funny noise. Dealer no help, service adviser had never been inside one.

<TEXT>I was ecstatic when my journey finally came in (took 10 weeks, was promised 8). I have had it for less than 2K miles and I have had it in the shop twice for the electrical system, when I start the car on occasion (about once a week) nothing runs but the engine, no lights, radio, turn signals, gauges etc) and am having a problem with the transmission skipping and hopping and also it is pouring transmission fluid on the ground when it is parked. Been waiting on a part for over 2 weeks. I have been told twice that the electrical problem has been fixed but it is still happening.

<TEXT>Ever since we have had this vehicle one thing or another has been happening. The mirror where you can put you glasses dropped down and would not stay up. We have had to have a new part ordered for that. The prop that hold the hood up came out and a piece came off so we have had to order a new piece for that. They tried to put it back three times so we finally took it to another dealer and they ordered a new part. Just this morning my husband raised the hood and a piece fell off that cushions the hood when it goes down. It is minor things but we are really unhappy with all these happenings.

<TEXT>Got this car in May to replace my previous SUV. So far, I love it! It has so many great features, and my kids love the comfort. I love the safety features. I would have the the R/T, but I did not want leather seats (I hated them on my last SUV) - these cloth seats look great, are comfortable, and I am quite happy with my choice. Drives beautifully,and is so very quiet. My only complaint to date is there is a pretty good blind spot in this car, but it helps leaving the extra backseat mirror down to help with this.

<TEXT>I am a Dodge die hard, bought the Journey after deciding that my 93 Dakota 4wd was out dated. Needed to keep a tow vehicle though as I have a small boat. Replacement vehicle needed to have decent towing capacity and all the latest safety features. So far this vehicle has proven to be very decent, good ride, extremely quiet, great interior storage. Like the radio controls on the steering wheel, very handy. V-6 very responsive, same HP as Dakota 318 v-8, this puppy will scoot when ask to, 6 speed trans works well. No towing info yet as hitch and wiring harness back ordered at dealership. I special order this vehicle and towing components should have been installed at factory, not the dealer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Journey SXT in May and have had it in the shop three times. The first time was for a noise the car made when turning left. I got the car out of the shop and a hour later something went wrong with the transmission and I had to take it back. I then got the car back and noticed while driving home the car made a loud grinding noise when accelerating and then took it back the next day. It has been 3 days since I have received my car back and it is know making a loud popping noise every couple of miles. I would not recommend this car to anyone. </TEXT>

I tried not to judge gas mileage too low because it was my choice not to buy a compact car. But some bad news, it has been in the shop twice now. Once for a back seat that would not slide forward and today for a brake light that will not go out. The seat could have happen while they were putting on leather but ...</TEXT>

<TEXT>My husband and I purchased this car in April of 08. We LOVE it. Its our first car of our own and we feel we have made a wonderful choice. It's safe with the curtain air bags in the back. The seats are very comfortable. I love the fact that all the seats will fold down to put large objects in the car. The back doors opening 90 degrees make it much easier to get our daughter in and out of the car. I love all the storage. I can keep diapers and toys in the car for our daughter without having to see them 24/7. I love the style of this car. I'm a young mom and I get the features of a mini van without the look. My husbands mother loved ours so much 2 weeks later she got herself one! Great Car!</TEXT>

She test drove it and told me that it was what she wanted. We had looked and driven many in the $26,000 and under range, and she only liked the Mazda Tribute, until the Journey that is. The journey drives great, and is comfortable. It is perfect for us. Controls are good, sound system is good, plenty of room and storage. After 1000 miles we average about 20.5 mi per gal. It is no speed demon, but as a family vehicle it is perfect for us.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our first car the day before Mother's Day. The next day, while driving, the car started smoking and the inside filled up with smoke. The car was leaking something from below which was actually dripping in little fire balls. The car went back the next day. They said it was a bad axle seal and that the company wants them to replace the part not just the seal b/c something may not be right with the whole part. Long story short, some hot words from my husband the manager found us a new car. Picked it up on Tues, brought it back Wed. There is a short somewhere preventing the controls on the steering wheel, horn, interior lights from working. So two cars in a week, both returned.</TEXT>

Love the storage options. Fuel economy on a recent trip averaged 24.5, mixed city and highway, and I have the 3.5 V6. Built in booster seats are perfect for our two girls. It has plenty of power when you need it and handles great. Hanling is tight. Love the 19" wheels and the MyGig. Only negative is the huge blind spot, but I bought some spot mirrors and the problem was solved. I recommend everyone give this vehicle a chance. Dodge was right on target with the Journey.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The ride on this suv is amazing. The R/T has a performance suspension and it is well worth getting. The suv hugs the corners and stays steady through out and handles rough roads easily. Has a very quiet ride at high speeds as well. The V6 mated to the 6 speed auto works great together. Don't get the 4 it is underpowered The drive train provides plenty of power and the 6 speed shifts up and down smooth. The third row seat came in handy when my nephews rode to town with us. DVD system kept all 4 kids entertained and the sound quality with the infinity system is excellent. I have had the car for a month now and can find nothing negative to say about it. You can do anything with the MYGIG system</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased a Journey SE Plus 2.4 L (I believe model specific to Canada) we paid $22,973 for it. We feel a great amount of vehicle for the money. It's safe, roomy, quiet, decent build quality as well as fit and finish. The 2.4 is a little noisy upon acceleration and it's not the fastest vehicle upon take off, BUT it's definitely something we can live with. We drove it around 80 miles the first night we got it home (2 days ago=). We didn't want to get out of it. We find the seats to be supportive, with a great upright seating position,lots of leg and headroom both for front and rear passengers, ease of entry/exit, we like actually LIKE the basic uncomplicated instrumentation. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We really like how quiet the Journey is . Other than the typical 4 cyl engine noise at lower rpm. At 120 km/h it's VERY quiet!

<TEXT>Overall, I have been very happy with my decision to purchase the Journey. I traded in a Dodge Grand Caravan and initially planned to get another one, then I saw that the Journey held seven passengers---a must for us since we have five kids. Except for one small trim issue, everything works well. I mainly drive to work, soccer games, and boy scout camping trips. Got the SXT with roof rack and Sirius out the door for $19,600 and 0% financing--- about $12,000 less than the Ford Taurus X. So far, I've been quite pleased. Morning carpools are easy, and when I need to haul stuff it is great to have the ability to stow the seats flat so quickly. I love it! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very comfortable seating position. Easy to access third row. My wife loves the Sirius, although I can live without it. Seating arrangement is very well designed.

I took it to the dealer and they stated the gas cap was not sealed properly, they opened it and closed it and said it would reset itself in 50 miles of driving. Well I drove it for the weekend and it stayed on. I took it to the shop for the second time. They reset the indicator light and sent me home. I drove about 20 miles, the light returned. I took it to the shop for the 3rd time and they said I needed to replace the catalytic converter. They sent me home for the weekend.

There is no way that should happen at this many miles. Chrysler said they would pay for the labor, well I guess that is something.

<TEXT>My transmission has had problems since day one and the dealership has been unable to duplicate the problem. 2 weeks ago it stuck in first gear. I drove it about 3 miles to the dealership and let the service manager ride with me to verify that I had a valid complaint. We drove several miles and it would not change out of 1st gear. I left it at the dealership and returned several days later only to learn that the transmission was working fine. Normally the transmission will slip and jerk in to gear after a delay. The Journey also will "die" for no apparent reason. The seats are uncomfortable and the ride is terrible! I would not recommend this vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have read other reviews here and I have to say that most of the complaints about the Journey are just absurd and elementary. Most all brands have plastic interiors,power wise this is not a sports car,we are consistently getting 18mpg in town and 25mpg highway. As far as transmission problems,we have have not experienced any,but that's not to say there aren't a few. As I drive around town I can't help notice all of the well marked courtesy vehicles from Mercedes, BMW,Acura and Lexus. Why do your think they are out there? Its not because they are getting an oil change! Most All brands have issues & recalls. We have the SXT model. Overall we feel the Journey is a fantastic value for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Leap for the V6 and the AWD with performance suspension. You will not find a better value for towing, passenger capabilities and comfort with an AWD feature amongst any of its competitors. There is a glaring difference in the vehicle performance with either the 4-cyl or just the standard FWD/suspension unit. All around solid and have not had any significant quality or performance issues the first 3000 miles. V6 with AWD will now only be available on the 2010 R/T's. Model will be cannibalized by upcoming Durango and Jeep Grand Cherokee as they are heading into the CUV platform. As Iacocca used to say, "If you can find a better car, buy it".</TEXT>

<TEXT>My main complaint is it's a wimpy V6. Now maybe I'm used to the bigger Cummins Diesel power, but this thing needs a little more juice, and the gear ratio makes shifting a full time job when traveling & doing hills. If you want the best performance, you MUST shift manually, and that gets tiring, after all, I bought an automatic! I think they could have done better. I also think the passenger side seat should be power also. The ride is very comfortable, my husband finds it almost impossible to stay awake when we are traveling, thus, I end up doing all the driving! For the price, I love the car, will I keep it? Probably not after 2 years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car in may of 2008, i came home with it and it had to go back to get the DVD installed, which ended up being a huge issue because no one at the dealership was trained on how to work it, same with the MYGIG. then we get it back the air bag light came on, then we were back in the shop for another 6 weeks until they could figure out the problem, now at 19k miles the brakes an rotors have to be replaced, the dealership said that every 9k this is happening...calle the useless folks at Dodge headquarters, they advise that this is normal wear and tear...also there is smoke that comes out from under the hood, which i have been told is brake dust, and that my car is 'safe' to drive...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I now have 15,000km on my dodge journey SE. So far, so good. The 4 banger is not that powerful but I did get it for the gas mileage (which is great on highway!). Still has pick-up and I don't find it too noisey. Curious how it will be long term though. I am happy with the Journey and will let you all know if problems start.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My original review was on Jan2/09. To date this has been a good vehicle. It performed great during our northern winters and now has 14,000Km on it. The only problems so far (besides my original review) is the panic alarm has gone off a few times when I use the key fob to unlock the doors. You need to manualy use the key to enter the vehicle and start the car to turn the alarm off. Very annoying for the neighbors at 4:30 am. This is a fun vehicle to drive and is very quiet. No defects other than what I have mentioned. Reliability is excellent. I'm getting ready to leave on a 5000Km trip. Gas mileage could be better, the best I got was 8.9L/100km on highway (with the air conditioning off).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I can't believe Chrysler is thinking of doing away with this vehicle. This is the best car I have ever owned. I was always a GM person, being retired from there. But Gm can't come close to the Journey for the same price. Their Travers costs about $10,000 more than the Journey. The excutives better rethink their decision to deep six the Journey. maybe they should do away with the Nitro and the Jeep Patriot instead of the Journey. If they do go ahead and discontinue the Journey I can see why the are the most disfunctional car company in the world. Maybe they should fire some of the excutives that are making these decisions. Why don't they advertise this gem instead their lousy trucks. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I really haven't had it that long, but I must say, for a crossover, you really get a lot of features and extras for teh price. It has a lot more leg room that it looks like from the outside. Drives smooth, and handles very well. I have seen in other reviews that customers were not happy with the way thinterior is made, that it is too cheap, but I disagree. Yes, it's not a lexus, but for a mom driving her 5 yr old, and 17 yr old around, it is very sturdy and functional. It's easy to clean, and takes the abuse that my boys have to offer (LOL). It's also very easy to fold the seats down, or scooter them forward, very user friendly for a mom on the go!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Well, there are a ton of things that I love about this car, but the most unexpected favorite is the rear AC controls. I have two kids, and I didn't realize how handy that would be.

<TEXT>My 11 and 13 year old daughters love the Journey. They like to fold down the seats and stretch out during road trips. AC plug keeps all the electronic goodies charged. Beverages in the chill zone, snacks under the floor and movies playing on the DVD. I consider the Journey a good value. I paid less than 24K with AWD, 3 row seating, MyGig, Infinity Speakers and Sirius radio. I could not price anything within $5k that seated more than 5. I frequently recommend the Journey to others. PS I think the MyGig radio below the heating controls works better in bright light.</TEXT>

To make a long story short, the car had less than 300 miles and the transmission needs to be replaced. Yes, that is right. We requested the dealer please just give us a new vehicle but they explained since it was already titled in our name they can't. We were assured they have the top service center at this dealership.

<TEXT>Purchased this vehicle one month ago, and we're still smiling. It handles like a bigger sedan, thanks in part to the larger rims and performance suspension. Gas mileage could be better, but no worse than a mini-van. We are pleased with our purchase so far. Handles like a sporty vehicle and does get positive looks from other people. Interior is perfect. Americans tend to want the "soft feeling" interior, but this vehicle reminds me of a European car on the inside, which is great. I don't sink into the cushions of the car, which gives it a more confident feel. Chrysler is on the right track. We traded our Caravan SXT for this vehicle, and we are thoroughly pleased.

<TEXT>We traded our 2007 Dodge MegaCab in on the Journey. We wanted something smaller that still had all wheel drive, could tow 3000 lbs or more and could seat 5 comfortably. The Journey meets all of those qualifications. It's extremely quiet at highway speeds and has been delivering good highway mileage, 24-25MPG. We love all of the storage, the transmission shifts smooth, and really enjoy sirius satellite radio. All in all, we are very happy with our purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was a bit skeptical at first about buying a crossover from Dodge but our Journey has proved me wrong! We have a fully loaded red SXT V6 (only missing the sunroof and DVD player) and love every bit of it. It's roomy, easily hauls people and cargo, and has lots of great features. I regularly drive a friend's Honda CRV and hands down, the Journey performs better and makes me feel more protected and comfortable. I realize the interior may not be as "polished" as high end models, but you can't beat the price Dodge offers on this vehicle. Haven't had the problems others report. Was a slight burning smell that came from exhaust pipe but it went away after first few hundred miles. Avg 20-23 MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We down sized from Infinity Q-56 to this Dodge Journey because we travel up to the Adirondacks every winter weekend and needed a car that was good in the snow-yet good on gas. The Journey is amazing in the snow and has never let us down. We are very happy with the get up and go that this car has. Another plus, is the amount of room this car offers, especially with the seats folded down. We often have our 3 dogs and our grandson with us and there is plenty of room. The only thing I really don't like is that the Nav screen needs to have a control on it-because its too bright at night and during the day you can not see it if you don't manually adjust it by going into settings. </TEXT>

It does not want to shift smooth into second. I keep getting engine lights and they stated that I have an emmisons leak and they are working on finding that.

<TEXT>Got this ride last year when my lease was almost up. For a long time felt like I had traded DOWN from the Grand Cherokee.. I still feel that way BUT when gas was over four bucks a gallon I was smiling at my Improved mileage. I was a bit worried about what it would do in snow since I couldn't find meatier tires. I have to say it went every bit as good at the GC and I was even going thru snow on roads that weren't even plowed this past winter. When I got home I had snow caked in the grill.. So I guess I will live with it for another 24 months and see whats available when this lease is up. There aren't that many on the road where I live. </TEXT>

When I turn on the A/C there is a "shushing" noise. I need to get that checked out too. Also, it doesn't seem to me that the rear window defroster is working at all. I have put 3500 miles on it since I bought it in Feb.09, with no problems other than what I first mentioned. It is quiet on the road and has enough zip when I need it. The seats show dirt quickly so I have to stay on top of that. The wiper blades are not good quality. They squeak and streak, so I'm not happy about that. Decent gas mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a used 2009 SXT Journey with 11,000 miles on it 6 weeks ago. Last week, the tranny locked up and it has been at the dealership ever since. Boast Dodge in Bradenton, Fl. After many delays, false hope, and mising parts, I am 11 days still with no car. Chrysler provides no loaner or rental, even though the dealerships are overstocked with new and used cars. I contacted the dealership, the general manager, and the Chrysler hotline, all give me the run around. Buyer beware, this is a first year car, plauged with problems, and a company who may not make it till 2010. Do your research before the purchase, if it's a good deal, theres bound to be a reason.</TEXT>

The next morning with 80 miles on the gauge I stop in the dealer to have it check. They told me it needs a new rear right axel and discovered that the right rear tire had a defect in it too. Took a week to get the parts. The dealer shop put it on and I was excited to finally get to drive my new car until, the mechanic call back and told me the problem still there. What a disappointment!

Now, for the past month and half, theres been a burning smell coming out of the hood. brought it in and service tech said that when i got an oil change they must of spilt some oil on the manifold and that it should burn off in 2 weeks. this was a month ago. besides all of this, we enjoy the car.

<TEXT>My loaded R/T finally arrived on 02Mar09!!! - beautiful. After thinking I wanted an SXT, my wife convinced me to move up to the R/T, it's great! Much nicer interior, and the subtle chrome is a nice touch. This car drives/rides like a dream. Eats up the bumps and road noise. The leather seats are surprisingly comfortable. Love the satellite radio, don't know how I lived without it if for all these years. I haven't noticed any of the problems people have been complaining about on other feedback sites. I'm getting used to the stereo location. I think it would have been more distracting if it were up higher (that's why I didn't get GPS). Well so far so good. I'll report more as I log more miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my Dodge Minivan for this vehicle because I wanted something a bit smaller and more stylish. I love the way this car looks and is quite roomy BUT I was VERY dissappointed this winter with how the thing handled in the snow. There were seveal times that I almost didn't make it up some of the hills where I live. I thought it may have been my tires - but when I went to the tire dealership, they said my tires were fine! Also, the seats show everything which isn't good when you have small kids and a dog!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We are very happy with our Journey. We bought it out of town and on the trip home it got over 25mpg by the built in computer. Loaded with items that are options on other cars and at a very good price. Ride is great and people can talk without shouting over road noise. 6 disk CD player and 6 speakers are standard, rear air and heat an option that is not over priced. Great vehicle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've had the car a short time and absolutely love it! Were getting 27- 29mpg on the highway and low 20's in town. We have 4 kids ranging from 8 months to 15yrs, and everyone fits comfortably! There is no road noise and the vehicle hands very well! You can definitely feel the German technology and handling in the vehicle! We live in Colorado and with the traction control the vehicle handles awesome in the snow. We purchased the FWD model. If you want the convienence, and mini van features without a mini van feeling, this is the vehicle!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The thing I like the best is the handling and control of the vehicle, not much body roll! The acceleration is smooth and crisp (V6).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I went from a Mustang GT to a SUV due to my daughters booster seat. I am impressed with the comfort and safety. The 3.5 liter provides wonderful power. 1300 miles no major problems yet, other than the panic alarm randomly going off (had to start the car to shut it off), a small clunk in the trans when shifting (only on inclines, think it has to do with the stress the drivetrain is on at an angle), and a very low drone on some left turns, which goes away after a few seconds. I will follow up with my local dealer if any become real problems. Gas mileage has been a pleasant surprise to my Mustang's 16.5 average. I am averaging 21mpg on mixed freeway roads, and 25-27 on nothing but freeway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After having the vehicle a month, the computer had to be replaced. It has a honking noise when I turn left. I just got it back after a third visit, it still honks. The right strut squeaks on bumps (a new strut is ordered), has a squeal (like a water pump sound) who knows what that is, and has a high pitch whistle when I excellerate. The plastic pieces are falling off the interior and constantly have to be popped back on. </TEXT>

<TEXT>MY wife loved the Dodge Journey. She has hip problems and it was easy for her to get in and out of.However, we have had it into the dealership several times and I am bringing it in tomorrow again.Loud noise when turning left. This was resolved by dealership. Sometimes when backing up the transmission slams into gear. The first time I heard It I thought we were rear ended. Dealership cannot find the problem, because it only does it on occassion.When going down the road and exceeding 55 mph. front end shakes. Does not do all the time so it is hard for dealership to correct. We are taking in tomorrow for a recall on brake sensor. Not a problem now but it could be. Gas mileage is poor also.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Loads of storage space. Handles very well. Rides like a car. Easy to get in and out of. Lot of features only found in expensive vehicles. Great radio.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We had our Journey for 3000 miles, and got T-boned by someone going 60 miles an hour. The car held up extremely well, and the side airbags deployed. Nobody was seriously injured, but the car is a loss. We just ordered a new one. I really like the car design overall, though I admit some of the plastic pieces inside come across as a little 'cheap'. From 55 to 75 (i.e. passing someone) this car will flat fly. It has lots of 'hidey-holes' to store stuff. Our best fuel economy has been 27 mpg on the highway. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I wrote a review in June of 08 and have had some problems since. The driver seat shimmys and the dealer doesn't seem to feel it. It also had a tapping noise coming from the engine. Brought it in and they had it for 3 days. Said there was a recall on tabs for the rocker arms.They put these tabs in and it didn't solve the problem.They ended up replacing the rocker arms.I have also had a prolbem with the express window feature on the driver side not working, and the doors auto locking on there own once I've closed the doors. I've been locked out twice. Really thinking this car wasn't the best choice. I now know why the give a lifetime powertrain warranty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a company vehicle, my last vehicle was a 2004 Dodge Caravan (which I loved). I've only had it 2 weeks and so far so good. I've just come back from a 1000Km trip and liked the feel and quietness of this vehicle on the highway. Handling is good, ride is a bit harsh, but I'm assuming that's because of the winter tires. My biggest complaint about this vehicle (to date) is the way it was designed to handle dirty road conditions in winter, ie. salt. First off the rear window wiper only wipes about a 135deg sweep. The wiper pivot is on the wrong side leaving a 45deg swath of dirty window right where you would normally be looking to find where a car should be when passing it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this crossover to replace my good ol' Plymouth Neon. I was looking for a Patriot, loved it in the test drive but waited a few weeks... and bam! The Journey went out! I just couldn't thank myself for waiting. For about $5,000 (Canadian) less, I could have about everything a Patriot Limited Edition could offer me (except for the leather finish, which I didn't want anyway). I was happy for being able to buy my familly a new vehicule, but with the Journey, I managed to get options I would never think of at this price with the SE Plus and the Family Pack options. I am very pleased with it and even made a lot of noise when going to friends a family with this beautiful beast.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The price! Lot's of space for people and cargo with the 5 seets configuration. The huge false bottom in the trunk. The soundproofing. The look!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The first weekend we owned the Journey the brake module went out and then during service found the cv boot was torn and about 2 months ago had to have the wrieless ignition or whatever it is replaced. Overall though it has been a good vehicle and the service has been great. Haven't paid for a service yet nearing 11000 miles. MPG can get up there as long as your not in traffic but thats any. Got it based on room being we have two full sized dogs that ride in the back(no thrid row). Tranny whines a little too loud i think. But it's quiet for the most part.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plenty of cargo room, all controls are nicely spaced other than heater and radio which should be swapped.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Really like the Journey over all but have had nothing but issues with it. I'm the 8th review of there is a noise when making a left turn and after 3 power sterring reseviors later it still does it. Also there is a ticking noise in the engine. Found to be rocker arms and tappets, both replaced and it still makes the noise. My car has been in the shop 4 times and I still have the issues. The journey rides really smooth, I got my 1st. speeding ticket of 23 years driving in it. Would not recommend this car, too many issues.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have about 1000 on my machine so far and all the pieces are still together. Gas mileage about what I expected, 28mpg highway. Don't know just why some duck put 19in. rims on this thing but here in northern N.B. most of us have extra wheels with snow tires. No one has 19 in. snow tires (scared to ask how much). Base wheels are 16 in. and would be OK except can't get them, sold out so far. Comfortable and quietest Dodge I've owned so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, I like the Journey. It is kinda small but it is for us and one child. The DVD player keeps the kid entertained and was well worth it. The interior lighting is nice (LED's are nice).

<TEXT>Before buying my SXT Journey with 3 row seating went and checked the Equinox, Outlander, Santa Fe, and Explorer. We went back to the Dodge dealer and we loved it since the test drive. The interior is modern, its fun to drive, love the touchscreen radio (though its placement is a little weird, but you get used to it). Love all the compartments and the fuel efficiency. For us, it has been a great buy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It was an easy choice after looking around at foreign crossovers. Sitting in the Journey, even without driving it, sold it to us. Roomy compared to it's foreign counterparts and extremely comfortable. It is a great transition family car for those wanting to move away from the "van" look yet maintaining the ability to transport your kids and their friends. Very happy with our first 1500 miles on it. Extremely comfortable and easy to drive. While some of the interior plastics aren't what I would call "quality" looking, they are functional and easy to clean and maintain. Wouldn't go back to the "van" for nothing!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got my Journey one week ago but I love it. I am a little upset over buying the convience group II and buying the third row seating and finding out that the cargo cover that is included in the convience group II does not come with it if you get 3rd row of seats. Why do they offer both and not list the exception. It is a rip off! I also ordered mine with a $500 owner loyality rebate but they would not give it to me when the vehicle came in. I think this is a breech of contract but I am investing both of these. I bought the first Journey this dealership sold and they were not aware of the cargo cover not being able to be installed with 3rd row seating till I ask about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Our Journey is used as a Pilot car behind oversize loads. We track performance constantly to ensure profitability and cost of ownership. This Journey has run 97.8% highway miles between 56 and 65 mph. The fuel economy is horrible ranging from 17.1 mpg to an all time high of 24.9 with an overall average of 19.8. We have a 2008 Dodge Ram 3500 diesel that runs with the journey, they alternate position. In front or behind the load. The Diesel 1 ton is averaging 20.8 We are very disappointed with the Journey and plan on trading it asap. We purchased it for the fuel economy and safety, it is safe. There isn't enough power to get hurt very badly.</TEXT>
