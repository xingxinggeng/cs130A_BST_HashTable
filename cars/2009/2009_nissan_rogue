<TEXT>I have driven the car for 4 months, traded in a ford truck. I drive 6 miles each way to work, and my driving is 1/2 highway and 1/2 city. I'm a decent driver, and my mileage is only 19-22mpg, at the most. The headrest is uncomfortable, otherwise the car is satisfactory. I feel very uncomfortable with the blind spots-the right triangler window and the rear window-are starting to feel like they are safety hazards. I regret having purchased the car because of the blind spots.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Switching over from a Chevy Equinox, this car has been amazing. I have no real complaints about the car. It has 9,000 miles and has only been back to the dealer to have a sunroof put in and for oil changes. I do see other peoples concerns with the awkward shifting, but it isn't anything that really bothers me personally. The fuel economy says 24, but if you don't drive hard, I easily have cleared 27-28 in the city. Great crossover for the reasonable price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sunroof, look, comfortable interior, for a small engine it has some nice pickup</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With every day 8 miles run to work and back home it gives me only 20MPG. Blind spots are awful, rear window is way too small, backing up is a pain... (I understand now why my insurance went up after I gave up Jeep Liberty for Rogue). That small orange, round shaped computer screen is annoying after a week of looking at it, it's so cheap and like an alien to the rest of dashboard. Suspension is weak to my taste. Lots of road noise when on poor pavement. With high speed and gusty winds vehicle behaves strange least. When you close your door it sounds like something loose inside. Ignition/access key is huge and ugly. Steering wheel, cruise.ctrl buttons, speakers/sound are poor quality. Etc.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Accelerates good for 4 cylinders. Roomy. Enough space in the trunk to bring all gds from Costco. Steady ride uphill on 65-70 mph. Relatively quiet on smooth roads. Seats shaped OK. Stops good. Observation: it feels like many (any car) reviews you can find on-line are hidden promotions actually. No?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I needed to replace my Infiniti QX4 and tried an 08 Altima SL, which was a nice car, but I desperately missed having AWD. After a bad winter, I traded it for a Rogue SL and am very happy. I didn't lose much in terms of MPG and gained a lot in terms of riding higher and having AWD again. It is comfortable, has all the bells and whistles i got used to driving the Infinite with a little more affordable payment.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After studying all the compact SUVs, we decided that the Rogue was just what we needed. It had good mileage (for this class of vehicles) and, in fact, we are getting 26-27 in town and close to 30 on the road. It has the clearance and AWD we needed for moderate off-the-road usage (wildlife surveys, kayak in-putting, etc.). In addition, it is very comfortable and quite quiet on the highway. Handling is better than the other compact SUVs that we tested. Reviewers complain about the storage capacity being less than some of the competitors, but we do not need it and appreciate the better looks and handling of the Rogue. Bigger is not always better. After 4 months and 5K miles, zero defects.</TEXT>

With that aside, and the few miles that we did put on the vehicle, it is unimpressive. It's an overpriced vehicle "without" the problems...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car about 9 months now. I should have bought a used luxury for the price. If you have a family larger than 4 forget about space in the hatch, there is no room. Makes a lot of noise on the express way. Not fun to drive in winds at high speeds. Handles like a gem in the snow and ice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We leased an AWD SL and have had the vehicle for about two weeks. So far, we are well pleased. We had an Explorer and while it was a nice vehicle, we really didn't need to be hauling around so much iron. I have not checked the fuel mileage but the little mileage minder on the trip computer shows an over all average of about 25.4 It is fairly comfortable for a smaller cross over. I love the exterior design. It performs adequately for us. I'm adapting well to the CVT with no up shifting. I'm well pleased with this vehicle thus far. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the Rogue for 2 weeks now and absolutely love it! I was really wanting an Audi Q5 but could not get the payments to work. I had a lease with Nissan for a Frontier and they took it 3 months early. I have test driven before the basic model hence why not excited to get this. The got me a fully loaded Rogue with leather and everything. The SL is such a difference. I live in the mountains so right off the dealership was from denver to Aspen. It handles great at low speeds and tightens up at higher. really fun with all the technology in there too. I love it and is so much fun inside and out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>There is no perfect small suv/crossover. The Rogue holds less cargo than a Forester,has one row of seats less than a Rav4,lacks the visibility of a CRV. However, it is perfect for me. The fit & finish is great, as is the engine. It has 5star crash rating and beats Ford with a stronger roof. In many ways this car is very basic- no leather,compass, or elec.locks. But it has such personality! It has a nice rear,each color pops and looks silky (even those orange ones). The CVT works well and the mini computer helps as well. I had owned a Chrysler product & went back to shop- Patriot, Compass, Liberty are all inferior products as is the Escape,Impreza,& 09Equinox. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD, Gas mileage (average 29), bright headlights, buttons on steering wheel, bright & clear instrument cluster in dash, stereo, fit & finish, strong a/c, cornering, turning radius, love having my turn signals independent of the brake lights, I believe I will have this car for a l-o-n-g time!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Seems a lot of reviews are from folks that got duped into buying the Honda CRV or the Toyota. The Rogue has everything and it all works. The rear window is small but unlike the Toyota there isn't a spare tire in the way or the Honda has three headrests. Any way if you want a perfect car keep looking as they will never exist unless you are a consumer reports fan and then go buy the boring car (CRV) and wish you hadn't but when you get upset grab your copy or CR and tell yourself its reliable !! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The options are great, the Bluetooth works and is very clear , the confort is very good for the class and nope it's not a Caddy . The fuel economy is better than expected given the performance.</FAVORITE>

Sunroof very easy to use and with the deflector added makes it even better. Like the trip computer as u can keep track of mpg or how many miles u have left before refueling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have read numerous reviews that are all so positive on the Rogue. I really feel like I am missing something. I have only had the car 1 week and I am sooo disappointed I REALLY WISH I could take it back! My main issue is the Huge design flaw (and I believe it's also in the Murano (which really wasn't too much better, slightly bigger, way more $$) the rear windshield is too small! The back seat headrests block the sides of the rearview window!!! This "Crossover" drives like a cheapy made compact car. My other auto is a Sonata and that has a far more quieter, smooth ride. I did Not expect this auto to ride so rough,my 06 Pathfinder had a smoother ride! Rate this auto a 5 all around.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Again, I have EVERY extra available but the only feature I am impressed with is the Bose sound system. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We kind of got duped into this lease.Here's my list - I'm short and the Rogue has VERY cramped leg room for the drive, it actually makes me a nervous wreck, the head room is also tight & the steering wheel barely tilts. The back seats r also stiff and uncomfortable (and I have the leather package), no adj. head rest(which also block visibility) & no seat adj in the back either. The visibility is HORRID and completely unsafe - the blind spots r huge and the rear headrests coupled w/ a small rear widow leave a tiny square of visibility. No matter if you like how it drives or not, it is simply unsafe to drive. This long time Nissan owner can not WAIT for the lease to end & it's only 1 mo in!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have wanted an SUV for a long time but have driven paid for cars for a while. Decided to make the jump to a new car (and payment) but I don't drive all that much so didn't want to make a huge investment. The Rogue gives me the SUV for a reasonable payment. Handling and styling are great, have hauled 12 bags of mulch in the back with the seats down and could have held more. VERY satisifed overall. Need to be a bit cautious on lane changes due to blind spots caused by small side windows towards the back - working on mirror adjustments and not changing lanes as much! Engine has a lot of oomph and the ride is really smooth.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall this is a good family vehicle. Meets the same fuel economy that our previous 2003 Altima 2.5S had. To me there's nothing fantastic but, I'm a sports car fanatic. The paddle shifters do help with that aspect though. Also does handle pretty decently for a tall vehicle. Some of it's braking components and suspension aspects are shared with the Sentra SE- R Spec-V. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>One touch sunroof. Versatility. Safety of AWD and the traction and braking assists. The electric assist steering. Adjustable headlights for when towing that pop up camper. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this car nearly a month and all I can say is wow! I replaced my much loved Pathfinder with this and I could not be happier. Yes, I lose space and some off-road capability (which I did not use much anyway), but the handling is terrific. I feel like I am in a sports car! Now I look for excuses to drive and I can because it uses a lot less gas than my Pathy. I totally recommend this little crossover to anyone who needs utility with a great sporty ride. Buy it for the fun of it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth ride with good power. No one knows this is a 4 cyl. because it is so responsive and hardly ever whines except on the steepest grades, but my Pathfinder did that occasionally and it was a 6 cyl. Interior is clean. Feels like a cockpit. Buttons and knobs are easy to use.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had the car for two months now with 4000 miles on it. I am getting 27-28 mpg with 50% stop and go, 50% highway. Still cannot wait each time to get in and drive it. The engine is quite peppy for a 4 cylinder. The center console and glove box are cavernous. Sound system is adequate but don't get the premium package just for the Bose sound. Not worth it. Love the steering wheel controls and 6 CD changer and AUX audio jack. Styling is much better than a CRV or RAV4. Nissan engineers did great with the fit and finish of the car as well as user errors such as turning off all int./ext. lights after 5 minutes if accidentally left on.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>-The CVT transmission -The high gas mileage -Extemely quiet inside -spacious interior for such a small CUV -Very smooth and comfortable ride</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just leased the S version with AWD. As it is built on the Sentra chassis and I previously owned a 2007 Sentra, it improves tremendously on that cars driving feel and performance. Steering feel is MUCH better. CVT takes some getting used to but overall I like it in the early going</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Car like handling and acceleration married to low-demand utility capabilities and fuel economy; very comfortable seats and arms support for driver; nice overall look but too similar to Murano; even "S" trim level should satisfy needs of most drivers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At first glance the rogue's didn't really appeal to me, maybe because I always seen a base model one (s) around town. After going to the dealer and seeing an loaded up sl model I feel in love with this suv! After owning 10 suv's in the past and also being a wholesaler I have driven a lot of midsize suv's and honestly im my opinion this is truly amazing! It rides so Nice, corners like a Porsche, and gets gas mileage like a civic. I love it and would highly recommend it to anyone!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I traded in a 1999 Mustang. She called me on her way home from work and said we were going for a drive. She said, "I am not driving this car one more day." She drives it daily and is very happy with it. She loves her daily 20 mile commute now. We have taken it on two weekend trips and it is an excellent road car. There is more than enough room for luggage and us to ride in comfort. I would highly recommend Nissan and the Rogue to anyone who asks. Our experience at the dealership was also very good.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The rear compartment is very roomy for a small SUV. The glove compartment is very large for storage. The AWD adds to what I believe is already excellent handling. We love how the CVT transmission handles.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>On the 2009 AWD SL the dash passenger & driver side trim around the vent reflects into the side mirrors (sunny day or cloudy) and is a huge distraction when looking to change lanes. Going to cause an accident. I brought this to the dealers attentions which the service area blew it off, i called corp and they could care less,the only person that made any effort to help render was the sales person. NISSAN listen up and don't bring out the vent so far on the dash and this will get rid of the problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my 2001 Mazda tribute. I wanted something between a car and my SUV. Thus The Rogue. I had a chance to take it out for an hour on the hwy. It was great. At first I left the radio off to hear the possible noise issues other have said. After I stopped focusing on the noise. No problem for me. Lots of pick up. NOT going to miss my Tribute. The Rogue takes corners so well. I can feel that car feeling. Love the option from automatic to manual shifting. Works well for that extra kick you might need the odd time. If your more aggressive you would tend to use this more so. .I did push it around the corners getting off the hwy. Did very well. hugged the road</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am impressed with the exterior, very nice design giving the feeling of a luxury vehicle. The interior is basic but also attractive. Some things I found to be missing that were bothersome to me were: volume control on the steering wheel, one-click power- up window control (there is one-click down, but not up)and auto headlights, no navigation system. The seat adjustment controls, power steering and dash controls are basic. These features may be available if you purchase the premium package. The Rouge handles nicely, although it is loud upon acceleration and it is noticeably a 4 cylinder vehicle. The new technology transmission takes getting used to, the car can feel a bit "put-put."</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The black interior is sleek, the back windshield wiper is nice to have, the Ipod aux feature is handy, big glove compartment, handy compartments in trunk, rear privacy windows, fold down seats and variable AWD. THe exterior is attractive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased two Rogues over the past 3 months. One is SL AWD with everything but leather package and the other has everything. In general, the cars ride smoothly, but can be noisy at wide open throttle. Highway merging is not a problem with the QR25. A good first attempt by Nissan in the cute-ute segment that needs a few improvements. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We just bought this car and are absolutely in love. We upgraded from a WRX - we have a 1 year old and needed more room. My only quirk is the speedometer. I like having the numbers at every 10 MPH, and a definitive line at the 5 marks. most of the speed limits here are 25, 35, 45. everything with a 5. But that's just my personal quirk. The view through the back is smaller then I am used to, but i don't find that its too small and have no trouble backing up. It is comfortable and fun to drive, and much easier to transport a 1 year old, and all of his gear in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the new Rouge in April '08. At about 5500 miles we started hearing the "NOISE". The service tech couldn't hear it at first. I did get it to make the sound and he heard it. He then drove it and he said he got it to do it worse. They contacted Niaasn tech line. They said that they were aware of the problem. The sound got worse and at 6800 miles they replaced the Trans. This would be the second transmission being the first came in the car. Then at about 12000 miles it reappeared. they didn't hesitate to replace the trans. The service manager could only say that it "must" be fixed but he could not guarantee it is a fix. I'm sorry to say that the trans is already "grawling".</TEXT>

If you've looked at the CR-V, Rav4, Subaru Forester and can't make up your mind... take one of these for a spin. You'll love the room, fold-down seats, rear storage compartments. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We just bought this car, and it is a thrill to drive! I love the CVT, very peppy and smooth 0-60. I researched and tested Rav4, Volkswagen, Mazda, etc., and none compared to the Rogue style/value. I traded a Pathfinder only due to poor gas mileage, but have always loved Nissan quality. This car looks awesome and is a blast to drive. It is very nimble and responsive... you don't even notice that it is a 4 cyl. I chose the AWD because we are moving back up North in a few months. I was impressed with the 5 star crash rating. I couldn't be more thrilled with this crossover!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm satisfied with my Rogue. Really glad I got an AWD since it performed better than expected in the deep show. Fuel economy is the biggest disappointment, 20-21 mpg on the highway. I've driven 6000 miles in 6 weeks and never got better than 21 mpg. For the 4 cyl this is lousy. Radio is average and the car has only one power plug! No vanity mirrors, oh, well. I can replace the radio and add accessories but the gas mileage is a problem I did not expect. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very thrilled to be the new owner of the 2009 Nissan Rogue. It has a super slick exterior look. Although the interior could use some spice. Really miss the extra storage spaces that my old car had. I upgraded to the leather seats and highly recommend it. It is fun to drive very similar to my old car as far as how it handles. Very quiet and good gas mileage. The back window could be larger to help with vision, however the side mirrors are a good size, so I just need to get used to using my mirrors more. Overall great car and highly recommend it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at the CRV, Mazda Cx6, Rav4, Saturn Vue and by chance stopped at a Nissan dealer and discovered the Rogue. The car won hands down, much nicer interior, the ride is great and it has plenty of power. Highway mileage 31.5 at 60-65, combined about 21-22mpg. The bluetooth is best I've seen and to my surprise, the keyless entry is great. The steering is great without being bothered by the road imperfections. There is adequate room in the hatch, seats are comfortable and the fit and finish is excellent. Wish it had a telescoping steering wheel, nav system and a little better rear visibility (back up sensors and cam would be nice). No need for the adjustable headlights. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was driving a 2002 Toyota Highlander which I loved, but was ready for something a little smaller with better gas mileage. I thought I would end up with the toyota rav 4 or honda crv, but there were things about each of them I didn't like..I didn't even know Nissan had the rogue model, and then I saw it in the paper one day, so I went to the dealer and drove the sl model, liked the features, the price was competitive, it felt more solid and quiet than the toyota and hondas I tried. It has been just 3 weeks and I really like it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Own Mercury Mountaineer but wanted something to drive to work that got better mileage. Didn't count on this! Awesome interior - hubby is 6'01" and needs lots of leg and head room - he's got it. Comfortable, roomy seats. Excellent turning radius. Great back seat leg room also and plenty room for luggage. Exceptional head room! Quiet - almost no road noise! Smoother ride than our nephew's Honda CRV. We are both thrilled with purchase. Couldn't be happier! Enough to make this ol' grandma feel like she's really "styling". Best of both worlds - SUV style combined with fuel economy, comfort and grace!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty, stylish. Lots of room, front and back. Great handling. Comfortable, quiet ride. Cool cargo compartment. Great fuel economy. Also has a lot of accelerating power for a 4 cylinder. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 12 years of driving my reliable, beloved Toyt Corolla, my husband insisted I get a car that he "fits" in. He is 6'04" and we compromised on getting a small SUV. I have never owned nor wanted an SUV. I literally researched and test drove the smaller SUVs for a year, before finally looking at a Rogue. We both absolutely LOVE it. It is so smooth, stylish, comfortable and unique. I love the fact that my husband does not complain about sitting in my car any more, since he has ample room. And most of all, I love walking up to my car, admiring the sleek exterior, looking around, and getting excited all over again that I am the owner of the coolest looking car on the parking lot.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Simple stylish controls. Plentiful storage. Sleek exterior. Keyless entry. Rear pop-up cargo compartment. Homelink system. Smooth ride. Heated seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My friend was interested in the Honda CRV but I convinced him to test drive the Rogue because I have been driving the same Nissan SUV for many years. I also drove the Rogue and I was impressed with how quiet it was even at 80 mph. We test drove the CRV and the interior was noisy when driving 60 mph and the styling was not as slick as the Rogue. Although he was the one looking for a car we ended up each buying one! We bought the S model but upgraded to leather seats and they look very nice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet drive, tight turning radius, center console for storage, purse hook in the back, good acceleration for a 4 cylinder, </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had two Ford Escapes from 2003 - 2008. Both units were well built and very reliable. Gas mileage was 18mpg combined, with our 60/40 city/highway driving style. After 3 weeks the Rogue is returning about 25mpg which is a big improvement. The Rogue SL seating is very comfortable & supportive. The ride is a nice balance between firm and cushion but never floaty. Six speaker audio is excellent. Cargo capacity is as expected for a CUV but adequate for 95% of our needs. Getting used to the CVT is easier than we thought. Very impressed so far. Hope Nissan service is just as good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Need high seats for my back, wanted better gas mileage than my Acura MDX was giving me, so I looked at smaller crossovers. Focused on Honda CRV and Toyota RAV4 and didn't love either. The Rogue was stylish, very technologically advanced and I didn't think I was giving up much by going to it. So far, so good. I got the premium package and leather. Very comfortable, great ride and handling. Great bluetooth system, which is important to me. Sound system is as good as you could want. I do not miss my MDX.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smart key. Bluetooth. Controls on steering wheel. Comfort of seats. Smooth ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drove the rav4, forester, patriot, crv,& escape. I have to say in terms of build quality, fit & finish, style, safety & comfort the Nissan Rogue won me over. Everything feels substantial - doors closing, handling, engine. The car is refined and sporty. The cabin is comfortable and all controls are logical (except for the missing radio dial for tuning). The car handles well. Steering is exact. Brakes are strong. In rain and snow the car goes where you direct it. I feel comfortable and safe in this car. Drive one! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fit & finish, handling, 5-star crash rating, great sound from radio, great illumination inside, comfortable and firm cloth seats, moon roof, keyless system, headlights & rear nicely bright! Ample room in back! Good MPG - I average 30 highway! I like the car computer - would like it better with compass.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We absolutely love this vehicle. We live in WV and we are getting 25.4 mpg. Since we do have hills in WV the mpg for an AWD is great plus the functionality of the SUV. When driving our 4 cylinders in the past going up hill you could always hear them kick down to pull. When we purchased this we couldn't wait to see what would happen. You literally can not hear the transmission at all. The CVT is so quiet and unbelievable. We looked at Honda, Toyota, Kia and Hyundai. For us they just did not have the styling, still square and not sleek like the Rogue.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM radio, heated seats sunroof and bluetooth as well as the CVT. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Honestly, I never considered this car until my wife and I actually went shopping for a small SUV. We drove the CRV and just did not like that car, and I love Honda. It wasn't comfortable, and the design (both int and ext) was unappealing to us. Hence, we went to the Nissan dealer to just see what they had, actually to look at a pathfinder. We saw the Rogue sitting there on the lot and we were both intrigued. We talked to the salesman, and decided to go for a test drive. The drive was beautiful. So smooth, quiet, and comfortable. The interior is so well designed. The Bose sound system is wonderful. This SUV walks circles around each and every SUV on the market in my opinion. Nissan is now #1</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>HID headlights, Bose sound, "smart" AWD (only AWD when it's needed), Comfort, quiet, styling, CVT is so smooth, fuel economy, blue tooth, steering wheel mounted controls, smart key</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have never driven anything so smooth and quiet, you can't even feel the vehicle shift. It provides excellent sound barriers from the outside. The seats and ride are so comfortable and the leg room is perfect for the taller population. The investment is definitely worth it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats; moon/sunroof; radio quality; controls literally at your fingertips; Bluetooth compatibility.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wow! I got this car because I loved the transmission this car carries the same engine, and same transmission as the Nissan Altima. 2.5L 170 hrs 175 torque. It faster, saves more gas, more reliable engine then the RV4 or Cr-V. Nissan Rogue won. On the turns it has better control and a smoother ride and a better suspension system for a smoother ride. If you hit a pot hole your steering wheal won't move. It's awesome!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth is really awesome, and the Bose system is amazing, the integrated key is crazy!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Rogue handles extremely well for a smallish SUV and road comfort is very good. While styling is subjective, the best selling point is a 20 min test drive. The stereo is exceptional in the SL and gas mileage was a big surprise.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering, ride and handling, comfortable seats, strong headlights and secure feeling in heavy rain on turnpike. High resale value. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was in the market for a small SUV. I was first considering a CRV and even though I heard about the Rogue, I didn't think much about it until I saw an ad from Nissan, so I decided to test drive one. I'm glad I did. I was so impressed that I purchased it immediately. Exterior is appealing... sort of like a baby Murano, interior is nicely laid out, very comfortable, the fit and finish superb. Since I live in South Florida and do mostly highway driving, I chose the FWD model. Handling and cornering are excellent, and acceleration is surprisingly good for a 4-cyl. through the CVT. Most impressive is how quiet and "solid" the vehicle is at 70mph.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall build quality. Quiet cabin. Smooth engine/transmission. Price/performance - that's why I titled this review "Nissan's best kept secret" - I seriously doubt you can find more bang for the buck in this category. Keyless entry/bluetooth cellular are very, very cool features and work well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I Bought a Versa 6 months ago and found that was too small because I have 3 kids and 2 of them need car seats. I looked trying to find a car seat narrow but I couldn't find it so I decided to change the Versa for a Rogue and we love it! I have more space for the kids and I feel secure.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort, quiet, awd, stereo. Very, very good on gas!</FAVORITE>
