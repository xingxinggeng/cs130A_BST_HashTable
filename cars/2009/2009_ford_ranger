<TEXT>This is my third Ranger, and I was torn between this and the Toyota Tacoma. Bottom line, for $6k less I got a truck that was just as capable. Perfect for hauling dirtbikes and associated gear to the track. My only complaint is the fuel economy. If you are going to buy one of these, make sure you buy the 4 dr supercab. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smaller truck, easy to maneuver. Plenty of power, great styling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Good truck, with good gas mileage. Small enough to do a daily commute in city traffic, and easy to park in small spaces. Would recommend the FX4, with the payload package. There are a few squeaks and rattles in the cabin over hard bumps, but that can be easily fixed. Runs great in 4x4 mode, especially with 4.10 rear. The only real downside is the Goodyear RT/S tires. They ride good on road, but do not grip well on wet roads, and not too great in the snow. BF Goodrich A/T tires would make the truck feel more capable in rain/snow. The leather seats are very comfortable and supportive over long rides. I highly recommend this truck. It's not as fancy, but it is just as capable for the price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Like the increased rear spring rate, helps when carrying light to medium weight loads. Leather interior is very nice. The steering is sharp and responsive. Bed extender is extremely handy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought a used xl longbed,2.3with 5spd. manual. As a 60 yr.old man, 6'tall, 250 lbs., I find this vehicle a solid buy and a solid performer. It's no frills, but peppy, frugal, and very tight. The design may be old but it's sure as hell not dated. A great value.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy in and out, good seats, lots of get-up, and great fuel economy(25mpg in town).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Truck is built cheaper than my 2000 Ranger. Rattles and sqeaks from day one. Shakes and runs so rough that it causes the body and seat to shake. This goes on while driving at all speeds. Dealership says this is in 'normal' range. Gas mileage is about 19 1/2. Far from the 21-26. Radio poor quality also. Cannot pick up stations that can on 2000 Rangers radio. Very unhappy and sorry to have purchased. Would not advise to buy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>single cab and size for a runabout. this truck has great possibilities but is being built with people who do not really care, all the way from management to the on line workers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought a 2009 Ranger XLT supercab automatic w/ the 2.3 liter 4 cylinder w/AC power windows, & CD. After reading all the average to poor reviews on the ranger, I only intended this vehicle as a low cost commuter and multi-purpose vehicle. It is actually quite good. Excellent price at less than $15K, acceptable acceleration, terrific fuel economy for a truck at 24 mpg average for 60/40 highway/city, and good build quality which Ford is now known for. I am very impressed. I drive a Mercedes Benz C350 as my other car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy at 25 highway and 21 city, easy to beat the EPA sticker</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>1st tank of fuel mpg disappointment 16.5mpg. But doing research learned that as engine loosen with more mileage it would get better and it did, with the 5sp. automatic I'm now averaging 30mpg after putting on 4,500 miles. Got 535miles out of last tank fill. Truck has a tight feel when driven, would be a perfect ten if it did'nt wonder when encountering road bumps. Needed attention by Ford. Otherwise great lil' truck! If you are over 6ft. like myself get the extended cap, trust me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>pwr windows,door locks,and mirrors. Neat sound system w/rear speakers in extended cab. Aux plug for mp3. Nice high back seats. Good place for cupholders. Secondary pwr plug</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Ranger XLT</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>First off it is an automactic, I could not find a choice for auto when filling out the Edmonds form. My last truck was also a RangerXLT, it was a 1996. I still have it, having done courier work in it since it was new, it now has 632,457 miles. all oringal, except routine maintance, tires, etc. The normal wear and tear stuff. The drivers seat has lost most of its cush, but not bad considering the hours sitting in it. Im just amazed how good its been, and still is. Now for the 2009, it seems to be built good and tight, and my reason for getting it, was solely for the reliabilty record these trucks have. Our luxury vehicle is a 2006 Toyota Tacoma Crew Cab. Back to the new 2009, I could'nt have </TEXT>

<TEXT> Cannot understand why reports run this truck down. It is a well made and inexpensive truck to run. You don't buy these trucks for heavy loads. Looked into a Toyato Tacoma and felt it was a rip off. Standard cap in stick shift only which forces the comsumer to buy bigger and about $4000 in price. Have owned 3 Fords since 1980 and have had dependable service. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE> 20-21 mpg around town and 26 mpg on a trip. First time for power windows and locks. Would compare the workmanship to any car/truck anywhere. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've put 4,000 miles on my 4cyl. maunal. Am getting 28mpg pretty consistently. It does bounce a lot but has excellent handling and surprisingly good acceleration, at least when empty. I can easily park in really tight spaces and it's easier to get into the garage than my Aztec was. Front seat is very comfortable with easy access even for my handicapped sister. Not a good choice if you routinely have more than one passenger even with the jump seat. If you really want/need a small truck for light loads that gets good mileage and can take a lot of abuse this can't be beat. The only truly small truck remaining. Ford should market it as such, it would have a niche of its own these days.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tight turning circle; comfortable front seats; ease of access; gas mileage(28 mpg with 4cyl. manual); sturdiness; price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought a Ford truck (my third one) because all the other brands of vehicles I have owned let me down when I needed them to be reliable. The previous 2 Ford trucks (1970 F100, 1993 Ranger) were pretty spartan trucks. The 2009 Ranger is much more comfortable and fun to drive. The only fault I have found is the 4.0L 6 cyl. is not too fuel efficient. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Body styling, fit & finish is good, good visibility from drivers seat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love the new front fascia design. I chose the 4 cyl supercab with a few options. Other than the vibration felt in the strg whl, door panels and seat, I love this truck. I drove the Toyota and it is just ugly as well as $4000 more with less options. GM products are not worth considering.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Ranger feels well built with no squeaks & rattles. The super cab 2- door space behind the seats is adequate for gear. I passed on the jump seats since I know of no one that small. The engine has decent power, but the fuel economy is abyssmal at around 15 MPG or so. Glad I don't have to drive much. The ride is a bit bouncy but well cushioned (I have the optional larger tires). The truck tends to wander a bit at highway speeds and requires the driver's attention on bumpy turns. All considered, I like this truck much better than my previous Chev Colorado - similarly equipped.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a '93 Ranger before this one, and been super pleased with it. I haven't had a Ranger for 12 years, it was time to have one again since we brought the house. The newer Ranger has more leg room than my '93 I used to have, and this time, I got the basic XL package, since we have a nice car for our long road trip. Where my old '93 was the XLT (full package), and I was single at the time. I am some disapointed with the louder cab noise than my old '93 XLT, but it's not the end of the world. Over all MPG, I'm pleased with the MPG I gotten on it.. On my first tank, I got 24mpg, I am near the ned of my second tank of gas, and I am around 28mpg as of now.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The solid ride, and good handling of the road. Like the gas mileage it gets.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought the 2009 Ranger with 2.3 I- 4 and 5 speed automatic. This is my 2nd Ranger the other is a 1996 never had a problem with it, so I bought a new one. The 2009 rides a little rougher, accelerates faster, and is more comfortable inside. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Five speed automatic and the better gas mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Was looking for a small truck to haul lawn products and purchase too big to take home in car. I needed pretty good mileage because I am driving it to work. Well, this is really the only compact now available and the current pricing is great. I was able to buy a new vehicle for about the price of a used one with 30k or so miles. The truck drives really great. The 2.3 inline 4 has plenty of power for both in town and interstate driving. The truck is really tight and has every feature that I can imagine that I would want. I would highly recommend if it meets your requirements.</TEXT>

<TEXT>All around a very decent compact truck. Off road traction is very good, perfect for work around a small farm. Much less road noise then i expected. Gas mileage doesnt seem to add up to EPA, but still very good for a truck. The biggest problem for me is the lack of leg room makes it uncomfortable for long ride. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auxiliary input, chrome package makes the truck look very sharp, towing capacity exceeds expectations, Heat/AC works GREAT! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I haven't had this truck for very long but I am impressed with it so far. It rides smoothly, has good fuel economy, and is very fun to drive. It has a lot of power for its size. Its handling is tight and is easy to move in tight spaces. Over all it's a dependable little workhorse.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very compact and easy to maneuver. Feels solid, and has great mileage for a pick-up truck.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> 2009 is the first year for the Sport in a 4CYL. I never would have driven one exceot my employer bought a fleet and the mechanics told me to test drive tone. I was surprised with the 4cyl guts. My gas mileage is 20.5 around town and one one trip it was 23mpg. Didn't look at any other models because I am stuck on the dependabilty of Fords. Great truck for the money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this truck in 2009 and so far have put 1000 miles on it. So far so good haven't had a problem with it yet. I'm not sure about fuel economy though, I have the 4.0L V6 and I get 14 in the city. I'm suposed to get 17 in the city and 20 on the highway. Other than that i love this truck. Its the best one That you can buy for the money. I wouldn't reccommend this truck unless there is only two people in your family. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>smooth 5 speed transmission, 207 HP out of a V6!, 5,000 lbs of towing capacity, sport cloth seats, audio jack for ipods, fender flares, nice alloy wheels, and fog lights</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have put 600 miles on the truck after purchasing new. So far, very satisfied with purchase. Put to work on day 1, but only light duty hauling. Build quality, road manners, handling, and road noise all better than one might expect for this basic truck. Fuel efficiency has been on target to EPA estimates with mostly normal driving. I rated performance very high - but not based on unladen driving. Power is not "excellent" but instead basically as good as expected. However, power under load is excellent - with 1/2 ton of lumber and other materials driving manners (handling, clutch performance, braking) did not significantly decrease and power was great. Will update once I've put more miles on it</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Only domestic offering of a truly compact truck. Selling at significant savings over a comparable Colorado (though with less standard equipment) and better mileage. Performance under load very solid; better than anticipated. Standard hitch. Independent rear suspension. Reachable bed (from side).</FAVORITE>
