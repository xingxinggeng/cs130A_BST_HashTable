<TEXT>After deciding between Accura MDX and RX 350, really feel that we made the right decision on the RX 350. The sporty style and comfortable ride is really impressive. Plenty of power to get you in and out of traffic (or into trouble). Gas mileage was really impressive on the highway (26 to 28 mph) on a trip to San Antonio to Fort Worth. In town 18 to 21 mph so far. Had a little trouble with window squeak when we first got it, but this was corrected at dealer. Very happy with the vehicle and the dealership.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, we are very pleased with the RX 350. It has a quiet, smooth, fun ride. The interior is meticulously crafted and comfortable. We had a minor alignment problem at purchase but the dealer remedied it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Our 2000 RX 300 had cleared the 125,000 mark so I took the wife car shopping at the Dallas Auto Show. She looked at 10-15 comparable mid-size SUV's and choose the 2009 RX 350 -- hands down. We had great luck with the first RX and we saw nothing we liked better than the '09 RX. Had it now for about a month and we've taken two trips. Super comfortable and WAY more fuel efficient than our original RX. Also, the turning radius is greatly improved. I think the best part of the whole deal though is that after 125,000 trouble free miles, the Lexus dealer gave us 26% of our original purchase price. Pretty unbelievable for a nine year old car with 125,000 on the ODO. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall styling is nice. We love the color, Brandywine. Wife loves the power tailgate and rain sensing windshield wipers. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Disappointed Driver</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>After years of driving practical SUVs I was looking forward to my first "luxury" vehicle but this has fallen far from my expectations. The next day after buying my RX350, I noticed a glass distortion in the windshield. I also started hearing a rattle at the top of the driver side window. There was also an air leak on the driver door which made it sound like the door was not closed all the way. Ever since the new windshield was put in there has been a ticking sound at the front right side near the dashboard that the dealership has not been able to fix correctly. The rattle above the window still exists even after having been at dealership 4 times for all the repairs. I am VERY disappointed!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats are very comfortable. Fold down seat options in back are helpful for maximizing space. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This Crossover is for people that looking for a very comfortable ride, I never wrote an auto review, but after driving this crossover for a month I decided to do so, just could not help it. I?ve had several SUVs in the past MB, BMW, Infinity, Honda. This crossover is for people that want name recognition, comfort, style. This crossover makes long trips, commuting very easy to accomplish, for someone who drives a lot on the daily bases, who needs versatility, cargo passenger space, like to sit up higher, likes quiet cruising. If you looking for a crossover that drives like a sports car, this will not be one to get, look at European rivals, MB, BMW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a 2009 RX 350 last month. I traded in a 2007 ES 350 for it. I have read so many reviews about how comfortable the RX is, I decided to get one for the extra cargo room when needed. As it turns out, I find it very uncomfortable driving. I had it back to the dealer and they found nothing wrong. Passengers also notice the bumpy ride. This vehicle took the joy out of driving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased the 2009 Pebble Beach edition. Very reliable vehicle. The navigation system is easy to use and access while driving (all touch screen). Very powerful car, good acceleration. The backup camera is a nice feature, but the images appear farther than it actually is. Have no problem driving in sleet/snow/ice thus far.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The AWD is a nice feature if you live in portions of the country, where the winter gets bad. The bluetooth is also a nice feature, allowing you to communicate hands free. The 6 disc changer is also nice. The exterior design gives a nice sporty look, while the interior makes it feel luxurious</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought a fully loaded 09 RX 350 FWD with the Mark Levinson sound system and navigation/bluetooth system. The biggest disappointment has been these integrated system. Most of the buttons on the touchscreen are greyed out while moving, so that no destination or telephone no. can be entered using the screen. Not even by the passenger - who could safely interact with the system. The voice activated system is awful, taking forever to navigate simple prompts. Similarly, while moving, the radio will not display text info about the playing song using the full screen. You can, however, watch the info slowly scroll by five letters at a time on the little radio screen (risking life and limb).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fit and finish is quite nice, performance seems quite good for an SUV.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my RX 350 for about 1 month. It is by far the best vehicle that I have ever owned! I love the drive and appearance of the RX 350. We live in the mountains and it handles well in the snow. I was considering resigning from my job because it was getting more difficult to drive the 400 miles a week to work in my car. Now I feel safe and have great visibility when driving. Our drive is 1/3 mile, mostly uphill. We just had a storm come through and I was able to put it in low, use the snow button, and came up the driveway in a terrible mix of snow/ice. It drove up like a luxury tank! The height of the driver's seat and the great headlights make it easy to see the roadway ahead. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I loved my LS 430, however it was terrible to drive on the hilly and winding roads of North West CT in the winter because of its rear wheel drive. The 430 has a superb ride - the RX ride is not quite as good but better than I expected. All in all I am very happy with the RX and believe it to be a better value for my money than the LS 430.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My four wheel drive RX zips around in the worst weather. Great Lexus quality and reliability. I had a Levinson system on my 430 and do not have one now - I cannot detect much difference in sound quality. It was nice to save about $4,000. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased a 2009 RX350 FWD fully loaded with Mark Livingston sound system. I now have about 800 miles on it and so far we really enjoyed the vehicle. It is the right size for us and fun to drive. Took it to San Diego last weekend and great ride on I- 5 and off roads. Get in and out of traffic on demand. The salesman at the dealership is really professional and guide us through the leasing process in under 2-hours. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav system, Blue Tooth systems are first rated. Interior furnishing is awesome. The sound system is by far the best we experience on similar vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My third RX. I've only had this one for one week and 500 miles. Excellent build quality, beautiful paint and leather/wood interior. Great acceleration and smooth performance. Still has the soft suspension and a bit of body roll on turns which may not suit everyone. Front seats could use a longer cushion and more fore/aft travel. I value comfort and reliability over high speed performance and sports car like handling. The Lexus RX is, for me, the best vehicle on the market.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power rear lift gate, full power adjustments on front passenger seat. V rated tires on 18" wheels provide better turning response than on earlier models but, amazingly, the suspension provides a smoother ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In the 4 months I've owned the RX350 it has been from Ohio to California and back, with several 700 mile days in the driving mix. Fuel economy runs around 23-24 mpg at 80 mph+ cruising speeds. It's extremely comfortable, with nice performance, being very brisk off the line, but at speed shows its weight and aerodynamic drag. The car (suv?) is very solid, and most interior features are well thought out. It feels large inside, but I came out of a restaurant at lunch to find it parked between two Suburbans; then it looked tiny! Brakes are very good, but the steering is a bit numb and the suspension is soft with resulting "average" handling. Not a single problem at 6000 miles. Great vehicle</TEXT>

<TEXT>1) Navigation system, with adaptive headlights, and rear camera not worth the purchase. Save money by buying a Garmin and jawbone, which work and outperform, what is on the Lexus. Lexus needs to rethink and engineer the technology with the thought in mind that less is more! 2) Lexus reliability is reason for purchase/lease and the appointments which come with the automobile are very nice. 3) Outstanding service with loaner car is a plus as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought an IS in March, found it too small. Received excellent trade value on it and bought this RX. Interior is much more luxurious than the IS and so is the ride. The engine is not as silky, though; feels and sounds more truck-like. Everyone loves all of the cool and innovative features. Fuel consumption is amazingly low. I averaged 24 MPG on my first tank. I like how you can fold down just the center portion of the rear seats. I am told that this is the best-selling Lexus vehicle. I can see why.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Self-leveling HID headlamps. Electric hatch closer. Rain-sensing wipers. Driver's cup holder next to the AC vent. Multiple adjustments of the rear seat. Extra storage under the cargo floor. Illuminated door sills. Sliding center console. Blackened wood trim. Information center.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased the Lexus a two months ago and to date we have enjoyed the vehicle. Have owned MBs and Volvos for years and decided to try a Lexus. Doesn't handle as well as European vehicles. It appears to be solid and I suspect will be more reliable than the European SUVs in the long run. With only 4,000 miles on the vehicle we are averaging around 19 MPG city and 24 MPG hwy which, I think, is excellent for such a heavy vehicle. Exhibits excessive body roll in curves and to much wind noise with sun roof in tilt position. Navigation system is not as intuitive as my Garmin. Excellent sound system. Seats are form fitting but not up to par with Volvo seats. Excellent cruising vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only owned the vehicle for two months, so I have little to say about it; but so far so good. I really enjoy the interior room; I'm a single person but do need the extra space from time to time. This car is based on the Toyota Highlander, which is a good vehicle to begin with; even though they both have Camry pedigrees, the car handles pretty good, and it was a bargain in contrast to other similar Lexus products. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cup holders! My previous car had horrible cup-holders, but this one is great. Also it's my first SUV ever, so I like the height. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Time to trade in my 2006 ML350. Although I agree that the Lexus is not quite like a German driving experience, the overall design of the Lexus is superior. Too many quirks in the German cars. I've had the new RX for a month. My city MPG is 21, highway 25. I'm impressed. Navi system is awesome. This is our second RX, and, Lexus has really improved the details on this SUV. I really wonder if the next gen will be able to improve on this. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Top notch fit and finish, very quiet, surprisingly quick acceleration, comfortable handling. Useful and spacious cargo capacity. Easy to park and maneuver. Easy entry and exit (especially important for my petite spouse). Bluetooth sound quality is great. Love the navigation system (detour feature saved us on a Dallas trip recently). Family actually likes that it still has an "old fashioned" cassette along with the CD changer. We have lots of books on tape that we thought we were through using. We expect great reliability. Love the RX!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great vehicle! This is the 3rd Lexus RX that I have owned and I have to say that they have gotten better with each one. I just traded my 99 RX 300 with over 135,000 miles in for an 09 RX 350 Pebble Beach Edition (Truffle Mica color) and this new RX is rock solid. My 04 RX 330 has a small rattle/creaking sound that occasionally appears but there are absolutely no rattles/creaks in this 09. As for the larger more powerful 3.5 liter engine... I love it. If you are considering a luxury SUV I definitely recommend the Lexus RX 350.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>High intensity discharge (HID), headlamps with adaptive front lighting system (AFS). The addition of an WMA/MP3 capable CD player. I really like the Pebble Beach Edition wheels... very cool.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have purchased several Lexus vehicles from IS350 to LS430. I was reluctant to drive/purchase an RX 350 because I considered it to be a "ladies" SUV. But everyday I noticed a lot of men have been driving an RX 350. So then I realized that it is no longer a ladies' SUV. About two months ago, I decided to purchase the RX 350 (Matador Red). I couldn't be more happy with my new RX 350. It is fun to drive as it drives like a car and yet my gas mileage is over than 23 MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first Lexus and will not be the last. In the past 15 years we have had 7 new Jeeps and that will never happen again. Point is, we love mid size SUVs. We got our new 2009 RX 350 in April, 2008 and the following week we went on a cruise, a wonderful cruise, but I could not wait to get home to my Lexus. I love my car. It rides like a dream. I LOVE MY CAR.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a FWD and Lexus dealers on the North East do not stock FWD vehicles. Visited my daughter in Atlanta and drove a 2009 RX350 from Atlanta to NJ. The fit & finish is great. My first luxury vehicle and the ride is a real luxury, quite cabin at highway speed, plenty of power to accelrate. Good MPG and I got about 27- 28 MPG on the highway. Experience with Nalley Lexus of Roswell was even better than the vehicle itself. We have lot of old cassette tapes and love the full logic cassette deck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having traded my gas-hog GX for a new RX, I am pretty happy overall. The car is comfortable, sufficiently powerful, and endowed with some features that the GX didn't have (such as HID headlamps that swivel, a power liftgate, and fold-flat second row seats). But I am a bit disappointed at the rattling sunroof shade and another rattle emanating from the right front dashboard area. I try to remind myself that I'm getting better mileage to counteract the annoyance. But after driving only 300 miles so far, I hope this doesn't foretell a future of other things going wrong.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation system--they finally removed the "lawyer screen" that required punching "I agree" every time one started the car. The power liftgate is a real convenience too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car! Function and form. What more could you ask for? A run to Home Depot? No problem. A night out on the town? Looking good! All the features you could ever want at a reasonable price. MPG that will make you want to ditch your SUV! Also, knowing that underneath is a Toyota product that will run forever with little more than the occasional oil change is very comforting.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power tailgate is great. I also love the navigation system. It's the best I've seen and it's easy to use. There is also plenty of storage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you're looking at the RX 350, then I don't need to tell you about reliability, fit and finish, etc. I picked up my 2009 w/nav a few weeks ago and I'm coming from a 2000 RX 300. Prior to that I've owned about 15 other vehicles - Toyota, Honda, Nissan. I drove the FX and the feel was much more sporty. However, the trunk space sacrifice was unacceptable. I've driven the 2004-2006 and I wasn't convinced that the improvements to my 2000 were worth the premium. However, in 2009, I can say that they are. </TEXT>
