<TEXT>This is a great looking, reasonably priced little sports car. It handles well and definitely turns heads at stop signs and coffee shops. I only have 1K miles on it, but it has been a blast to drive. My only concern at this point is the high oil temperature readings. I would really like to hear what Nissan's solution is for the high temp readings.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned for a month, now 1500 miles on it. It is amaZing! Installed K&N Air filterz and seemed to help with the car breathing better, little more powerful. AC off, drive 55, you can average at 30 mpg or over. Of course up to 70 with AC on I was happy to see 25 on average. Touring Sport pkg/19" wheelz, road noize on smooth blacktop iz reazonably quiet. Texas throwz down that Hot mix surface crap to save money & soundz like I'm in a Jet over the enginez. Not Nissan's fault the SouthTX roadz are crappy. Road surface makes a difference. Car was made for better roadz. Yes, lots of looks. My favorite DPS officer took a look and granted my 1st speeding ticket in yearz! Have to watch in Z!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seats are comfortable for my 100 mile a day commute 4x a week. (200lb 5'11"). Plenty of room. Gotta have the Bose/Nav upgrade. I feel very SAFE in the Z. Solid, plenty of power, smooth. Styling is World Class. Hi oil temp @ 120 mph for 5 mins. was 200F. Ok to me. Auto transmission is fast!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great job Nissan ! 09 Got the Nav pkg/Sport Pkg. loaded. I have owned Porsche, Vette, Cameros, Range Rover Ect.... This is a great car for the money Truly. Handles sweet, power when you need it. I live in San Diego so I have not experienced the heat or need for oil cooler ( hope you guys get help though ) Comfort is amazing, sound system great, Nav easy to use, like the phone opt. and inside is roomy, your not on top of one another, nice. Great use of interior space thanks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2005 BMW 330CI with the sport pkg and sequential manual tranny. It was a quality vehicle and fun to drive. I test drove the 370 Z and felt it was more me than the BMW. It looks great, (turns heads)has rapid acceleration, shifts easily, and corners like it is on rails. I,m 5'11" and weigh 170. The seats are comfy, head room is ample and leg room is good. I now have over 1200 miles on the car (mfr's break in period)and engine and tranny feel much better. I live in East Texas and the temp has been in the mid 90's and low 100's since I've had the Z. 240 degrees is the highest the engine oil has gotten. The Z engine is noisy but seems quieter as it breaks in. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Nissan 2009 370Z Car on February 26, 2009. I have been very disappointed with my 2009 370Z Car, because you can't drive it over 4000 RPM's, if the ambient temperature is over 90 degrees. As a result, I only have 630 miles on my 370Z! The 370Z Car, without an engine oil cooler, will over-heat! The engine oil temperature reaches 280 degrees, if the ambient temperature is over 90 degrees, and it will do it in a very short period of time. When this happens, the car's engine RPM's are reduced from 7500 RPM's to 6500 RPM's, and if the engine oil temperature reaches 290 degrees, the engine's RPM's will be reduced to 4500 RPM's, which is approximately half of the 370Z Horsepower!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 2009 Nissan 370Z is an excellent handling car. The interior is very well set, and easy to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My previous autos were an 08 TL TypeS, an 06 Vette, and an 05 Charger Daytona. I know performance and quality. The 370Z has more of both than any of my previous vehicles. She's perfect for hotrodding around town and a great interstate cruiser at 79mph (yep, in the summer). I ledfoot it all the time and have never seen my oil temp gauge above 225(& I live in Central Georgia). Build quality and finish are outstanding. Heat isn't an issue unless you take it to the track. And if you intend to, at its price point, what's the big deal about putting an oil cooler on it? Worried about warranty? Don't race the car! After 14,000 troublefree mi, the car is simply without peer cost/value/performance. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Crazy fast, corners like it's on rails; yet has interior quality and exterior fit and finish that shame both my '08 Acura TL TypeS and '06 Vette.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The get up and go of the VQ37 engine is amazing, it oozes power. Very flat torque curve, keeps pulling harder as you shift. The car bleeds sex appeal, no matter who pulls up alongside you, heads are turning, men and women alike. By far one of the best looking sports cars out, especially for the money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle after 6 months of research. I got the sport package which I would recommend due to styling cues and the great rims. I previously owned a 06 350Z. The new design of this vehicle is so much better that the 350Z. The intelligent key is amazing. I recommend reading the owners manual to uncover some great features. The key can roll the windows up and down, but the intelligent key can only roll the windows down. Cruise control is now standard and the syncro-rev works perfectly. It also helps with a smoother upshift. I can not drive any where with out people straining to look. Road noise is acceptable and the ride is smooth for a true sports</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned many sports cars before (from MG's to Porsche's), but never had a Z. The 370Z really looks the part: aggressive, integrated, and brazen. The interior is a good place to drive in, and the seats work well for spirited driving. I have the touring pkg. with alcantra seat inserts that are comfortable in hot or cold weather. This thing goes great, brakes well, handles well, and is flat out just FUN! I considered a Porsche Boxster or Cayman, but this is more involving at 2/3rds the price. Not as refined, but you're not paying Porsche prices for parts or service, and it is arguably more fun in daily driving. Ride is firm but comfortable on the highway. Handling not upset by bumps </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, handling, brakes, and steering feel very much in touch with the road. Never boring vs. Porsche seemed TOO refined! Nice touches include satellite radio, bluetooth, 2-stage heated seats, instrument binnacle moves with steering wheel adjustment. Sport wheels and limited slip diff. work!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car overall is wonderful. The only problems so far are that the seats are made for smaller/thinner people. If you are larger, they may not be comfortable. The access for a "lighter" style battery connection is up under the passenger side console. Not very convenient for plugging in cell phones, etc. The back cargo area is very limited. Our small dog's crate will not fit in there so we can't use the car for traveling. The blind spot in the rear quarter panels on both sides is bad and I have almost changed lanes on top of people twice. Limited rear view. As an every day driver though, it is fun and really turns heads. This is our 3rd Z car and we still have our original, a 1978 280 2 door</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hey out there, All you new 2009 370Z Car owners need to ensure that your 370Z Car can handle high Ambient temperatures. I live in Georgia, and the ambient temperature is almost always above 90 degrees, during the months of June, July, August and September. I've had numerous contacts with Nissan's Consumer Affairs Department, regarding the 370Z Car's need of an ENGINE OIL COOLER. The 370Z can not handle driving at speeds of 60 MPH, or more, with out the ENGINE OIL TEMPERATURE reaching the 280 degree mark, which is what Nissan indicates is the MAX OIL TEMPERATURE the car should operate at. All 370Z car owners should contact Nissan's Consumer Affairs Department and demand a RECALL! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 2009 Nissan 370Z car is fun to drive, but you realy can't drive the car far, and at speeds over 70 MPH's, whithout the ENGINE OIL TEMPERTAURE rising above 260 degrees. Nissan states the MAX ENGINE OIL TEMPERATURE should not rise above 280 degrees. The 370Z car can't be driven at high speeds!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this car at 80 miles last week and I already have 800 miles on it. It's such a blast to drive it. People pull up next to me while driving and ask questions about it. I have no problem with the seats(mine's leather) and the bose system is awesome.The music does not distort at all even at the highest setting. I've reached speeds up to 120+ mph easy. The manual transmission is really tight and close. It can jump off the line with no problem. The trunk can fit at least 2 mid sized suit cases. The two problems I found though is that there is a blind spot behind you and when the sun is shining directly on the fuel gauge you can't see it at all. Other than that I highly recommend it</TEXT>

<TEXT>I would drive this for at least one day before buying, the seats are very poor quality, and can cause terrible jostling when driving over any bumps in road, you cannot drive this any distance without incredible back discomfort, I would not recommend this car, the discomfort and non support has taken all the fun out of driving this car. I tried to get the seats fixed, but it was impossible, as per Nissan as well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just traded my F250 for a Z. What a car. I'm actually looking for excuses to drive around. Never owned a standard transmission before, but it sure is fun!!! I can't imagine driving a car that could make the experience any more fun. Only problem is my rear is too wide for the little sporty seats. Hurts like the dickens after a little while. Guess I need to do more driving and less eating!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The look is impressive. Synchro-rev matching is great. Sound system is good. Easily interfaces with my ipod. Nav system is very good and intuitive. Intelligent key system is great because I always have things in my hands and it is a pain to have to look for my keys in a bag.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've purchased a new Nissan 370Z in February and I haven't had the time to drive it. It only has 400 miles, so I hopeful that I will be albe to enjoy it more in the near future. I've owned the following "Z" Cars: 1970 240Z; 1976 280Z; 1990 300ZX; 2003 350Z, and now my new 370Z, which in my opinion, is by far the best of all the previous Z Cars that I have owned. Having said that, there are some items that Nissan must serious consider adding to the 370Z. The car's engine must have an engine oil cooler, because it can't handle any extremely hot weather without loosing a large amount of engine power, dut to the oil temperature getting to HOT! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have 2008 350Z, very impressive. Only minor issues in 30000 miles. Obviously went to see 2009 370Z to compare. Gone are the leather door panel trim for left over seating materials. Gone is the rear storage, which was huge for this car. Gone is the accessible 2nd power point. Now located inside the armrest?????? Gone is the hideaway cup holder, replaced by an ugly hole in the center tunnel. Gone is the blended center dash flip up door. Replaced by an ugly covering of leatherette with white stitching that stands out and constantly grabs your attention. Gone is the rear wiper?????? Question: A tow hitch port in rear bumper??</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm the previous owner of the following Z Car's: 1970 240Z, 1976 280Z, which I owned for 27 years, and did a complete restoration (frame off), 1990 300ZX, 2003 350Z, and now I've Just purchased a new 2009 370Z, which in my opinion, is the best Nissan Z Car that Nissan has made, by far! Having said that, there are several features missing on the 370Z that would really make the car truly outstanding. They are as follows: This car desperately needs an oil cooler for it to perform at the speeds it's capable of; needs the same low tire pressure monitoring system that was on the 350Z; needs to have a digital speed indicator, like the 350Z has; and the information panel need a complete update.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 370Z handles as good as any sports car out made. It has good power, but with just a little bit to tweaking, could develop much more horse power. I think the Nissan engineers did a good job with up grading of the interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I only want to comment about negatives aspects of the car because there are too many positives. First, Nissan needs to fix the dull looking fuel guage. Also, the guages are very hard to see in the sun light. Second, and PLEASE NISSAN, LISTEN TO ME ON THIS! PLEASE have an option to display the SPEEDOMETER DIGITALLY. I can't tell you how much easier it is to have a digital display. If not replace the traditonal needle with the digital display, at least give us an option to show it with a multifunction display inside the speedometer, like Honda and Mercedes-Benz has done! Fix some blind spots and the rear visibility, but I guess that might take away from the exterior beauty of the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my fourth Z and is clearly the best in overall performance and can match or outperform almost any sports car on the road. I test drove a Porsche Boxster the day before I bought the 370Z and it matched its performance as well as being quicker. I had some reservations about the restyling from the 350 before I saw it, but it's gorgeous. The Sports Package, with SyncroRev matching, TC, bigger and dagger styled wheels is worth it. At 6'0", I felt very comfortable in the cockpit.I usually negotiate the price down, but even at MSRP, it was a steal. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove my 1986 300ZX until 2005 and sold it for a great price even then. In the 370, it took a bit to get used to such tight steering and a great spring in the clutch. Another feature not to be forgotten is a very effective breaking system - press gently. I drove the car very carefully for 2 or 3 days. Now, I am taking curves at speeds that would tear a sedan off the road. This car sticks. I have a great feel for it. Still glad I took time to break things in gently. I have put 700 miles on so far. And summer awaits!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior is the head-turner. Flared fenders - wow! Cockpit interior (w/ minor changes.) I also personally love the tach in the center. And sound system.

<TEXT>I was driving a Cayman S and the Z car is a totally different animal. I know they are suppose to be competitors but the Cayman is much more comfortable and feels like the precision Porsche Euro sports car that it is and the Z car feels like a cramped Japanese sports car which it is. No comparison but I just wanted to try the Z car for a year or two but im going back to the Cayman S next time. Dollar for dollar the Z is a good value though and if you arent 6-1 like me its probably a better value . A smaller person might not feel as cramped as I do. I just fit in Euro cars better. Acceleration was ok but the Cayman S just feels more exhilarating for some reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle the day after it was delivered to the lot - I just couldn't resist it! While the interior has improved when compared to the 350 model, there is still very little storage and extreme blind spots. 4 cupholders are really 1 considering you lose 1 if you want to plug in your phone or iPod and the 2 in the doors are too small to even hold a standard 16.9 FL OZ H2O bottle. But the space behind the seats is convenient for a purse, jacket, Kleenex, etc. I was able to pick up a friend at the airport with two good sized suitcases. The cockpit truly is driver friendly and it has all the conveniences of the newer vehicles in a much more exciting wrapper.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling, responsiveness and acceleration are exhilarating! Despite what other reviews have said about the noise, this is after all a sports car, not a luxury vehicle. And if you are using the amazing sound system as intended, you shouldn't be concerned with engine or road noise.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ok went to dealer today at 1130am and drove out with car at 3pm, went from a 99 Yukon to this, kept the Yukon by the way. WOW, this car is amazing, never owned a Z car, was concerned about the visibility with mirrors, no problem at all, was concerned about being to low, actually feels like I am riding very high and have great views all around. I got the 7 speed auto because with the paddles, my left foot can just provide bracing as I haul down the road. Put over 125 miles so far in one day on this car and tonight when I got it home after taking the wife to dinner and she drove, we sat in the garage and just admired a sexy car, this car is sexy fast.</TEXT>
