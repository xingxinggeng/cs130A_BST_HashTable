<TEXT>I bought my car just over a year ago and I have no complaints about it. I hear some that say it doesn't live up to the fuel economics, but I drove from San Diego to Washington averaging 31 mpg. If that's not good enough for you then buy a prius. Car has been great and everything that I bought it for. Fun to drive and decent power for how much it weighs. Wish I would have waited for the Ralliart. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an amazing car for what it is. Value and character. For one of the few AWD cars on the market with a straight 4 and the turbo provides amazing power from 20-120+mph and is a dead accurate vehicle. Shifts are precise, engine is solid, turbo is ample. Just a true joy to drive when you are in the mood. However, it's not a great highway cruiser or Sunday driver, it's a harsh and loud ride with little insulation and driver amenities. I use this car for a 65 mile commute daily (round trip) and it has its downfalls. Noise, moderate fuel mileage, VERY SMALL GAS TANK and loud overall with performance tires. But it is what it is: performance car with power to spare & character to match!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power! The addictive power. AWD is a plus for sliding into turns and it will rip the steering wheel from your hands if you aren't prepared. I haven't yet met a car on the road that the RA won't run with, except unmarked State Trooper cars. It really is an amazing ride!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I disagree with the other people saying the fuel mileage is bad. i drove this car from Kileen, Texas to Colorado Springs and averaged around 33-35mpg!!! Both trips. The only thing I don't really like about the base models is the HP. It shoulda been upped a little compared to the newer 4cyl. N/A cars out there, but nice car looks mean in the front.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The lancer drives very well. It's as quiet as any of it's competitors, as corolla, etc. It soaks up most of the bumps with minimum effect in the passenger car. It's engine, a dohc with Mitsubishi Innovative Valve Timing and it's continuously variable transmission both work to make the ride pleasant. I've had two prior generation lancers and they all were highly reliable, with minimum repairs and breakdowns under severe use. The car is very safe and sturdy - uses very strong steel. The only flaw is that the epa fuel economy is already below it's competitors and below the prior generation lancer 2007. And when you drive it - it seems like it's below the epa estimates also - especially city.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ease of steering, ease of braking, comfort of the seats and good suspension (excluding gts which is less comfortable). 100,000 mile powertrain warranty and 60,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty. NOTE: It might be worth buying the 2010 because stability and traction control are standard in all models.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love the car so far. Graphite Gray. Had an old car with a huge V8. Gas mileage is not perfect but much better than old car by a large margin. Interior has nice style but the quality does lack behind. I thought interior in GTS was better than the ES model. It is a comfortable car for me, I'm 5"10. Spoiler does block the view but you get used to it. For a 4 cyl it is pretty powerful, but it could have more power. The back seat has a decent amount of room along with the trunk for a compact sedan. Overall a pretty decent car for the price. Got mine for a great deal so can't complain. If looking for a cheaper compact sedan that has a little bit of sportiness, the Lancer is for you.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The bluetooth, fog lights are real nice. The paddle shifters are a nice touch to the car. Mitsubishi added the scuff plates, alloy fuel door and a custom pinstripe to the car which really added a lot I think. Overall the GTS is the best deal in all of the models.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car drives & handles great. Put 3k miles on it in the 1st 3wks we had it w/ not one issue! MPG was better than advertised. 32 mpg w/ the A/C on most of the time! That's from Calif to Colorado and back. Great hands free Bluetooth system. Cruse Control works well and the stereo is not bad for a stock system. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Feature rich... Great steering wheel controls. Lots of room for passengers front and back! Trunk held 4 suitcases and 2 carry bags plus odds & ends. A/C works well, @ first thought it would not but surpassed expectations!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car a week ago using the "cash for clunkers" deal. I wanna add that the deal is a real pain but worth it. Ultimately this was an awesome buy, great car for the money. Its fun to drive, amazing looking, handles well, I'm averaging 26 mpgs and the warranties are great. What I have to complain about it the rear spoiler, although adds to the aggressive look I love, its does become a pain when looking in my mirror. Also this car needs a 6th gear, but then again what car doesn't? I'm so glad I got this over the Impreza, I just hope my opinion stays that way come winter.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2009 Lancer GTS in 2008. I was shopping for a used, more fuel efficient car, as I was driving a BMW SUV. I miss having the SUV, but not filling it up with gas! I call my Lancer my little techno-bile. That's why I bought it for all the latest "stuff"-really the bluetooth. The sound system is great, but I miss having the Bose that my Infiniti had. For the Lancer price loaded, you can't touch a BMW or Infiniti. I miss the leather seating. Love the Octane Blue color. Got a special coating put on it (aftermarket) to save the paint from chipping and fading. Good investment. I also added a billet grill, as I thought the plastic grill was "cheezy- looking". </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car for about 3 weeks now and could not be happier. Was able to get the 0% financing promo too, which saved me thousands over the term of the loan. The car handles great and is just fun to drive. I highly recommend the manual transmission, its smooth hydraulic clutch and short throw shifts really add some fun to the daily drives to work. Also the appearance package is a must, it gives the car a great aggressive look. The leather wrapped steering wheel has a great feel and quality to it. I think there is plenty of pickup to the 2.0. I passed on the GTS because of the 18in rims and performance tires. I live in NY I didn't want to have to buy snow tires and switch them on every year. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car on April 30th as my first new car after graduating college. I considered the Subaru Impreza and Mazda 3 but was blown away by the price, standard features, and performance of the Lancer. The 5 speed is fun and smooth. The engine could have more power, but with average 28-30 mpg I can't complain. Build quality seems to be great so far. The ES comes standard with many nice features such as steering wheel mounted audio controls and alloy wheels. You don't need to spend a lot of money to get a great looking Lancer. The ES comes standard with many great features. Sure there are always improvements, but for the price it's hard to beat. I highly recommend it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was in the market for a fun-to-drive compact car with A/T. I liked the GTI's power and paddle shifters, the Civic EX-L with its stylish exterior, and the Zoom-zoom feedback from the 2010 Mazda3 hatchback GT. However, I've found that the perfect combination of these features exists on a Lancer GTS, with all three available packages (sun & sound, technology and touring). Sure, it hasn't got the power of a GTI, but who redlines their cars on a daily basis? It handles just like a Mazda3 with lots of excitement, and it looks much better than all of the above mentioned models. At a price tag of a mere 22500 (w/rebates&tax), I can see myself smiling and enjoying this sweet ride for years to come.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Lancer GTS for nearly a year and let's just say - it is going away. The power is not bad; but heaven forbid you have to use the A/C. It sucks SO much power from the engine. Mileage is as expected, but I can't get over the complete lack of power in this thing. Interior is not all bad; seats could be a bit more comfortable on longer trips. The NAV system is alright; but how about some updates for the maps? My house is over 2 yrs old and my street doesn't even show up. When I called Mitsubishi about updates; they told me this summer w/ a cost of $100 - are you serious? It will be a happy day when she is gone from my garage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned this car a couple months and love it. Its 230hp keeps it as fast and fun as just about anything out there, while the 4 door design maintains practicality for passengers and other daily uses. The shiftable automatic transmission is a joy when you want it to be. The AWD keeps the car stuck to the road. Standard technology includes bluetooth phone to make calls without taking your phone from your pocket and a "FAST" key remote sensor that enables you to unlock and start the car with the key in your pocket. The exterior styling is fantastic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning the vehicle for six months, the paint in the rear quarter panels is chipping by the rear doors. I took this to the dealer and they nearly laughed at me. The service manager encouraged me to file a fraudulent insurance claim to so that they could get compensated and repaint the vehicle for me. Body shop people stated that this is a design flaw and a lot of Lancer's are having this problem. I was actually told to just budget for body work every year. Such a shame because I love the car otherwise.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Lancer in July, and like all of you, was very excited about the look, ride, value, and features. That is until I washed and waxed it after a few months. The paint on the rear side panels chips like you would not believe. I searched on the internet and found so many other Lancer owners that this is happening to as well. WHAT A BUMMER!!!! If I would've known the condition that the paint would be in after only 6 months, I wouldn't even have considered a Lancer. Oh yeah, you guessed it..."It is not a defect with the vehicle design or paint, so it is not covered under warranty." Normal road wear....you've got to be kidding.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first Mitsubishi I have ever owned. So far after 1000 miles it drives pretty well. No problems yet. I am getting very good mileage. Up to 34 mpg on the highway. Rarely do I get less then 27/28 mpg anywhere. Smooth ride and not too noisy. Yes, it's a bit underpowered but I can live with that for better mileage. Overall a nice car and fun to drive. The price was good too. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this GTS in Oct 08 from Northside Mitsubishi in Edmonton. The car looked great and seemed to be fairly tight. We were pretty excited being our first new car for my wife. at 4000km, the rear main engine seal half way through a 1200km trip. The engine needed to be pulled and the seal replaced. Roadside assistance did nothing for us and we limped 600km to the dealership, filling oil every 50km. At 6400 the transmission started packing it in and will be going in for replacement on April 13th 2009. The company will do nothing for us other then repairing the major issues even when they struggle in today's market. Replacing the vehicle would be the solution, which they declined. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, I have owned this car for six month's now and it's been pretty good although I have had some issues in which iv'e had to return to the dealer for. As with any car there are pro's and con's. However, there are more pro's than con's with this lancer ES CVT. The pro's are great handling, very sharp looking, great mpg, good power, and a very quiet interior. I did have a few issues early on with the trunk light not working and the rear airbags cover came loose from the clips that held them in place. But those issues were fixed at the dealership. I traded in a 08 Honda Civic LX and I enjoy the Lancer much better. It handles better, and looks better and is more quiet interior and has more power.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car now for about 9 months and am very happy. Eye-catching exterior and the interior is nice. It runs great and I'm getting 30-35 mpg on the highway! The CVT takes getting used to and the engine is a bit loud. In normal city driving, it feels as if the transmission is slipping but you eventually get used to the CVT. If you need to get up to speed fast, the paddle shifters give you everything you need WHEN you need it! Sun and sound package is a GREAT upgrade! My biggest gripe is the rather large rear spoiler- it blocks your rear view quite a bit. Overall, a very nice car at a good price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car thinking it would be reliable and would outlast all the American cars in the same price range. Well, I have owned the car for about 4 months now and am not pleased at all. The car looks great, gets good gas mileage, but works when it wants to. This past month I have had to take the car back to the dealership for the same problem. The car doesn't want to run in the cold and the engine starts to act erratically. The service engine light comes on and the same code keeps coming up, "Torque Monitoring". The Dealership says they cannot fix my car and neither can Mitsubishi at the moment so I am left with a car that is brand new and won't run in the cold weather. LEMON LAW!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car to escape the crazy gas prices a while back. This car is the best bang for the buck. I looked at a lot of cars in its class and none came close; most (Civic, Mazda3, etc.) were more expensive with less options. You can't find a better car loaded with these options at this price. This car is much better looking too; looks like Bimmers, Audis and Volvos in the 40- 50K range! Not thrilled with the performance from 0-30, after that, it's great. I chose the CVT (convenience) over performance. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the look of the car but the interior is very cheaply put together. The trunk area almost looks like it?s not finished from the factory. I live in Ohio and this is my first winter - let's just say it's going to be a long five years with this car. It definitely needs traction control. I neglected to ask about that when I purchased the car, needless to say had I known how poorly it would handle in the snow and ice would have never purchased it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When we first got the Lancer in mild weather it was fantastic - we felt like we were driving a luxury car! We first noticed an issue with the radio/speakers a few months ago. The radio didn't actually start to make noise until the dial was at 15. Last week, anytime anything other than talk radio the speakers are now crackling. Since winter started the rear door windows are taking FOREVER to defrost (over an hour) and interior parts are rattling (locks on the doors, back window, silver stripe on the passenger door). We called the dealership and they told us there was nothing they could do about the rattling or the defrost issues as when it gets cold that's what happens. Nice response! </TEXT>

It's got a tight ride, (glued to the road), takes a beating on terrible city roads, is peppy and looks sexy. It has more than adequate power and with the kicking sound system, it's more than fun to drive. I've bought 8 cars new since my 1982 driver's license, and by far I'm happiest with this one the most.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First off I bought this car back in may. I really liked zipping around in this little car during the summer but then winter has come along and I can honestly say that this is the worst vehicle I have driven in the snow. The car does have decent pickup but I think it could use a little more HP. If you live in a warm climate and want a fun little car to zip around in then this one is for you. My best mpg is 29 on the highway and I usually average around 17 in town. Seats are comfy but the ride can be rough at times also.

<TEXT>My previous car, an '02 Hyundai Elantra broke down so I decided to trade it in. I had been researching new cars and had considered this as well as the Suzuki SX4. Test drove my Lancer and I was hooked. I got the GTS with the standard stereo, no nav. I kinda wished I had gotten it but I couldn't justify the extra cost. As far as the performance, the car is quick and handles great. The tires seem to be the limiting factor. Everywhere I have looked people criticize the Dunlops for their lack of traction, especially in the snow. The car is comfortable and drives great. The gas mileage is awesome. Its better than the mileage I would get in the Hyundai, even though that engine was smaller.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I started looking for a new car I wasn't sure what I wanted. I drove the corolla, the sentra, and this little baby. I knew that I wanted a strippo to get the price down and I was blown away with this car. It's relatively quiet, it has a fair amount of power and never feels slow on its feet. The thing that sold the car for me was the ride. It's never choppy and I could relate it more to a big car then anything else in its class. The clutch and the transmission is very smooth and easy to operate and to me feels like a manual transmission should. Being that I do live in the midwest I did have to pay the extra money for the A/C which was well worth it. Give it shot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I own the GTS 4-door sedan CVT. First off, I have owned my car for a little over 2 months now. This car is great overall. I have the nav package w/sun and sound, and those things are just amazing. Don't get the car without it. The bluetooth for mobile phones isn't perfect, but it's a great addition to the car. People can hear me clearly, just at a low volume. Also, the car handles like a dream. I haven't driven it in snow, but it's great in the rain. I've driven other cars in rain and always feel like I'm going to lose control, but not with this car. Also, the mpg is better than the advertised value. I am averaging 28 mpg city driving. This car is one that's worth checking out!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this 2009 Lancer GTS Automatic. First, for what you are paying, this car is truly incredible. I've research the others and read other reviews, the reviews speak for this car. I traded my 06 corolla in for it and will never own another 'yota after this car. For approx. $17200 out the door I got this car loaded and for what I paid, blows the competition out the door. I drove easy on my way home from the dealership and averaged 32.1 MPG, going about 60-70 MPH, not bad at all, I drive easy however. All I can say is, Mitsubishi, awesome job. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Display, comfort-(I'm 6'3" 200 lbs) and this car fits me perfect, smooth automatic transmission, and well-built feel to it when you drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well I went to the dealership to buy a Kia Sportage. Then I found out that it was too small, and that I wanted something more sporty. I found the Mitsubishi lancer. And I loved driving for the first 5 miles, then before I got back to the dealership I new that it was my own car already. Its a fast one, with a lot of nice stuff. I got the sport package and the sun & sound package with the bluetooth, for only 19,300! I was looking at a Honda Civic coupe but the lancer is so much more worth it. And its a perfect size for a girl too! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Ok, I just bought a brand spanking new Lancer as stated above. I just love this car. I've always been more on the bigger longer taller cars but if you're looking for a super fun to drive sporty fuel saving compact then this car is in a complete league of its own. I would recommend this car 110%. I looked and test drove many of cars before making my final decision. This car beats them all. From driving to listening to your favorite tunes to just doing everyday running, you just have to drive one to know what all of these reviews are saying. How many other cars do you see where none of the reviews can really find any real problems with the car? None that I have seen! Just buy one ;-)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sporty unique design along with the easy to drive handling. All the other feature are just a plus to make a great car even better. 650 Watt Sound with Steering Wheel Controls/Navigational System/Remote Less - Keyless Entry System are just to name a few..</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I knew about the low armrest in center and on door. However, I still loved the car. Nice sporty look and feel. The car drives great. The gas mileage could be slightly better, but all is still good. The GTS vs the ES drive is night and day. The ES motor feels like it is winding up and going to snap, the GTS sounds great while accelerating. If you get that sweet spot on where to rest your arm, then you will enjoy the car. Knobs are well laid out. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I didn't choose this car. this car chose me. after 2 minutes into the test drive, the car was sold. it is extremely fun to drive with a tight turning circle and a performance tuned suspension. CVT transmission is great; very smooth. 2.4 liter sounds awesome and provides good acceleration. the car rides like a beemer; quiet in the city and on the highway with very little road, engine, or wind noise. I got it fully loaded with the nav, 650 watt sound system, FAST key, stability control and HID auto headlights. gas mileage is not the greatest, but the car makes up for it with how fun to drive it is. would recommend to any/everybody.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I first test drove the car off the lot, I was hooked. The car turns on a dime and has minimum body roll. The 2.4 L engine is a improvement from last year. The extra horsepower if perfect for the 4,000 lb gross weight of the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my first NEW car (7 miles at pick-up) - traded my Dodge Intrepid. I don't know how many times I've noticed people checking the car out even a stranger at the gas station who struck up a conversation with me about the car. It's an absolute dream to drive, a ton of fun and so packed with technology that it's like driving INSIDE a computer sometimes. Highway MPG is very respectable, city isn't the greatest but isn't that bad either. It's not a car to challenge other sport compacts to a race but if you're looking for a fun-to-drive car with enough get-up-and-go to get up and go this is worth adding to your short list.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just recently purchased a 2009 Lancer GTS loaded. It's great fun to drive extremely perky 5 speed. My only complaint is it doesn't have a leather option and the 5 speed could easily be converted into a 6 speed which would be a lot more efficient! The car is great the performance on it is extremely good for a 168 HP 4 cylinder (beat my gf's 08 mustang (it's automatic)) the fuel economy is far better than what it's rated at! I can draft behind a semi on the highway going about 60 and get up to 45 MPG (instant icon read 50 once or twice) but it overall is an extremely fun car to drive and I would recommend it to anyone! The car is a little heavy but it handles like a dream! No cheap feel either</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first brand new car I have ever had. I gave up my 2003 Pontiac Vibe for this wonderful car. I do work for carmax so I had a general idea of the competition for this car and I have to say that once I jumped in this car that I had no planned on buying I just bought it. What a great car. I'm very happy and I look forward to driving it everyday. It's quiet on the highway and seems to be pretty comfortable. My first tank of gas was 26 mpg driving in a mixed driving environment. I'm sure it will do 30 no problem on the highway. Great car if your looking for a new car under 15. I'd rather have this than a civic or a corolla.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The GTS is nicely equipped for a vehicle under 25k with nice pick up and go especially in the midrange rpm. The interior is fairly sleek with blue accent instrument panel. The 9 speaker Rockford stereo system definitely thumps with a 10" woofer in the trunk. The mileage is pretty good for highway driving. I've been averaging 28 mpg which is what i was getting on my ford focus but this car definitely has the fierce look to it. A real head turner. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Mitsu could have made a winner with this lancer but have fallen short of the process. It has the looks, the killer instinct and presence that tends to say get out of the way am going through. Has all the bark but lacks some bite. It's not as slow as some people tends to believe. If it want to go fast it certainly can. It lacks acceleration though. Highly recommended for freeway driving (goes fast and gives decent MPG). Hate it on City driving (horrible MPG). Don't get me wrong, I love my car and I have it for 4 months now. Just wish Mitsu made it a little better</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Lancer. I went to the dealership not thinking that this car would be what I wanted, and I actually had an appt. with an Infiniti dealer the same day. After test driving this car I fell in love with it. The pickup is great in the 2.4 and the ride is quiet. I have the dark gray and people think it's the small BMW! I trade my cars in every 2-3 year (lease) and always went for the high end 6 cylinder cars. This car is just as good if not better. I love driving it, the ride is really wonderful!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got my new Mitsu 2 days ago and I love it. Test drove 5 other cars that are comparable and this one was the best by far. GOOD JOB MITSUBISHI. Just hope you keep it up. The car has some amazing safety (good for my kids) features and lots of toys. It totally blew away most of the competition and at 6 foot 6 I enjoy the roomy interior. Lots of toys as well... Satellite radio, Blue Tooth, awesome stereo, and sunroof... Excellent warranty which gives me (new father of 2) peace of mind. Sales people were awesome as well. Let the car sell itself. They did not have any theatrics, drama, scripted tag teaming, etc.. Highly recommend the dealership. Great car and again, thanks Mitsubishi. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a truck guy, I bought this for my wife because I didn't want a "family" car. I couldn't even think of parking a Corolla, Camry, Sentra or whatever else in my garage. I love the aggressive styling. It's fast, don't get the wrong idea, using the paddle shifters will push you back in the seat and get you to triple digits fairly quick, I mean, after all it is a 4 cyl. We got octane blue, which is great looking in the sun. Fully loaded, every option available. Even had the dealer tint the windows and the car looks even better now! If you're on the fence, go drive one, you will buy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned the car for about a month now. I got the 5spd manual with the sun/sound package and the navigation. I love the car so far. It has all the technology and features I wanted in a car. I was considering used BMWs, audis, acuras, etc. but when it comes down to it, this is a much more unique car and very fun to drive. I love that all the features and technology will last me at least 4 years of enjoyment while I drive the car too and from work. Some of those used BMWs didnt even have ipod hookups, i can't deal with that, lol. Anyways this is a sick car and is a blast to drive. Great warranty and overall good deal when you compare run of the mill cars like the civic and corolla</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first new car I have ever owned. I have to say I'm very happy. The engine is a great balance between performance and efficiency, the 5 speed is smooth, good brakes, and is LOADED with features. I have an ES with the sun and sound and sport package. I wanted a GTS, but got a good deal, it has everything but the 18" rims and the 2.4L. The interior is minimal, yet attractive and roomy. I love the stereo and steering wheel controls. No other car in its class can compare. I drove an 09 Corolla, for the same price it had 15" hubcaps! And the transmission sucked as it was slooooow. This car is beautiful and has a great warranty. I cant recommend this car enough. </TEXT>

It drives fantastic all while not being to stiff over rough terrain. It really is a great balance between comfort and sharp maneuverability on the road. Navigation option really puts the icing on the cake with this car. Its navigation computer is so incredible I cant even believe it is on a car at this price range. All I can say it wow! </TEXT>
