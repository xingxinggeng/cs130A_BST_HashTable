<TEXT>Bought it brand new and love the sporty way it handles - nice acceleration and fun to drive. I used to own a Ford Focus wagon and this car is way more luxurious and comfortable. I was in the market for a station wagon and noticed that there are few offered in the US - mostly from European car makers. Did not think I would be able to afford a German car, but this one is affordable! We had one minor issue (something creaked). The part was replaced under warranty. 15,000 miles @23/32 mpg (city/highway) with no issues but that. This car comes with ESP, plenty airbags and anti-slip-regulation. The panoramic sun roof lets in light, but no heat.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fahrvergnuegen! Quiet and sexy car. Good pickup if you need it. Aux input jack in armrest. Awesome radio. Comfortable seats. Sun roof is wonderful. Child seats install easily. Lots of storage in the back. Synthetic oil requires oil changes only every 10,000 miles. Complementary courtesy check.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Drive 30K miles a year. Cost for diesel will pay for itself in 1 year. Range 500 miles using 12.5 gallons. Came with 6 months free Satellite. Now do not have to listen to the political hate shows. If American companies had this engine they would need to be bailed out and we do not need to rely as much on foreign oil. Traced in 1999 truck(clunker) getting 12 MPG and now getting 40+ MPG Great car so far(6500 miles)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am really happy with the fuel economy and features of this car. It is fun to drive but still gets very respectable mpg. I still have power when I need it. We also have a Honda Civic Hybrid, and the VW is getting better mileage, and is much more fun to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car overall. I traded from a loaded 2009 Honda Fit. While the VW's ride is far superior, the Fit's features were quite impressive too. To take the VW from good to great, the VW needs voice navigation and steering wheels mounted controls. It needs front fog lamps and the homelink. the $500 for the blue tooth seems pricey too. Otherwise, the TDI is quite amazing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Torque, cargo room, Nav radio sound is impressive. The HD radio is really nice too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This Jetta Sportwagen is my first (and likely last VW). The engineering is wonderful with so many well thought out features. However, the build quality is just not acceptable. Thus far I've experienced a couple of horribly annoying rattles, a bolt that holds the door on fell out, the driver's seat became wobbly, and the $60 cargo net accessory is now useless as the clips that hold it to the anchor points popped off. The dealer fixed one rattle (which has now returned) but clearly didn't wish to investigate the other. I actually dread calling to make a service appointment because it's always a frustrating experience. It's a pity because aside from the harsh ride the car is great fun to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, seats, cargo capacity. There are many cool features: radio goes back to a reduced volume after car is shut off and restarted, wipers occasionally move slightly at shut off to keep blades in shape, electric lock on fuel filler door, wipers go to intermittent at stop light, many more.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>One year ago I purchased this car, and had it towed to the dealership for a Fuel Pump Relay issue 2 days later. 32K miles later and the car has been flawless, with excellent MPG at highway speeds. This car isn't the fastest/ most powerful, but it has an excellent balance of power/performance. In North Dakota at speeds of 75 - 80 we got about 41 - 42 MPG. Steering is responsive and the ride is quite smooth. First 3 services are free, and free inspections for the life of the car isn't bad either. The longer you drive the car the better it runs. Looking forward to the second year!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plenty of torque, acceleration, heated mirrors/washer jets, no issues starting/ running in winter, ~600 miles per tank. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is best on the highway, where it gets great mileage and the firm seats remain comfortable for the whole trip. But as a city car I'm not so sure. DSG transmission can be annoying. At 30MPH it wants to be in 5th with engine @ 1100 RPMs. You can shift it yourself though. Mileage drops from 45 on the highway to 25 in the city. Nav /radio system has glitches and sound quality is mediocre. Cargo space is really impressive for a car this size.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an update on a previous post. I have put 11,000 miles so far since March and have averaged 39 MPG overall 60/40 hwy/cty. I routinely get 45-50 MPG on my 70 mile commute. The engine with the manual trans. is fun to wind up and it is easy to merge in traffic with all the torque. Taking it in for the first maintenance was easy and painless. So far so good!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The most bang for your buck of any car on the market. I have the 2008 Wolfsburg, 2.0T and I'm getting an AVERAGE of 29.5 MPG over the least 10 - 15 tanks. I've never had one under 27 and my last tank was 31. I also think it has a perfectly tuned transmission - I never feel like I need to be in manual mode. Bottom line: great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm glad I ended up with the VW TDI after comparing several other cars. The TDI performs better than expected. Plenty of power and handles great for a small car. MPG is great, if you compare the TDI to the Hybrids currently on the market you will buy a TDI. I believe 5- 7 years down the road the TDI will still be running strong the Hybrids will be costing you a fortune. Not to mention all the hazardous waste from the batteries used.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Been driving a Sportwagen TDI (DSG)for 3 months now, and absolutely love the car. A very practical wagon with loads of cargo room, interior design that's far more like an Audi than Honda or Subaru, and the gas mileage of a Civic! The car feels wonderful on the road - solid and much more powerful than 140hp would lead you to believe. Yes you pay more for diesel fuel, but with a 40-cent spread between unleaded and diesel in NY, you still come out ahead, and put less CO2 in the air to boot. Gas mileage is very temperature dependent - was getting 34 mpg in winter, but already the commute is up to 38 mpg with spring temps (it's hilly here). Totally love the car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only put 1K on the car so it's way too early to judge the reliability therefore the lower score. My wife wanted me to buy a Civic but relented to my choice of car. Unfortunately, she drove it to work last week and now she wants it for her own. The car is very comfortable to drive. I can tell it was designed to drive the freeways for long trips. You don't hear the engine at all at cruising speeds and you are at the peak torque @ 60mph. At first start up, and at a stop sign, the signature diesel sound is there but very muted compared to a bigger oil-burner. Finally, we are very pleased with the mileage. At 1K odometer, we are getting low 40's highway, around 35 mixed driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our Family has Corolla and Civic. This time we choose Jetta. After seeing Jetta we are so pleased. We just realized how much of a car we missed in the last years. Carefree Maintenance is something really amazing. This clearly show the reliability of a car. Cargo space is well designed. I guess its bigger than Camry. It was an amazing experience when we took it on a high way. Over all it was fun. When dealer explained the safety and the construction I don't think no compact car come close to it. German engineering is amazing. I guess we will replace Corolla and Civic at the earliest. I would say from now on we are Volkswagen family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This replaced my 2006 TDI in August. Think I was the third one sold by the dealer. Seat is the same as 2006, and I found out that new TDI(s) have electric passenger seat (I should have waited for it). Best mileage running Minnespolis to Louisville was 41 mpg (WINTER DRIVING). New EPA ratings are realistic for a change. Around Town gets around 33 mpg (WINTER DRIVING). I expect a minor improvement with straight #2 fuel. I love the mileage and feel of the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>3 months old now with 4400 miles. Very good mileage--34/35 city and 40+ on highway. TDI engine has great torque and good acceleration. Automatic is superb--shifts great and extremely smooth. Use the huge sunroof all the time. Tight handling and attractive interior. Sound system is very good. Lots of room--cargo space almost as big many SUVs and wagons. Solid build and tight tolerances on body work. Styling is pretty good too. Very impressed as cars for last 12 years have been Audi A6s, A8, S8. This wagon is a great car and very good value.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Moved up from a 2000 Golf GLS. The build quality is excellent, very good road feel and on the road track. Low-end torque from the 2.5 is a little disappointing (compared to the Golf), it can be stalled quite easily. That said, the car is great, wagon very roomy (almost as roomy as my 2004 Passat Wagon). I recommend this car to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first real car was '77 Rabbit. Drove Japanese and American afterwards. Realized I missed my VW. I absolutely love this new Jetta! Great torque through entire power band. Love the tight German suspension engineering. Manual transmission shifts like 'buttah'. It's so much fun to throw the car into any curve, have it stay planted on the asphalt like it's on rails, give it some throttle and come rocketing out the other side. WOW!! And this is the base S model. Interior fit and finish is xlnt. I'm 6'4'' and have plenty of leg/head room, compared to most Japanese cars. There's enough bolster in the cloth seats for those curves, but still very comfortable for my daily commute to the city.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was really wanting something affordable, but the Rabbit's were too small and the Jetta's were a bit boring. The SportWagon was perfect because it was affordable ($20 k)and very cool and different looking. It's one of the few cars you can drive that is truly unique. The quality of the materials is amazing for such an affordable car. It's definitely not as boss as my wife's Passat (4 cylinder turbo), but for the price is fantastic. I recommend the manual transmission to avoid the slight delay on take off found in other V-dubs. This should be anyone's list who wants a beautiful, roomy, fuel efficient, fun to drive car. Nothing compares to it for the price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Below are the ACTUAL mpg and average speed figures as reported by the onboard VW computer: MPG = 34.7 at an average speed of 32 mph 34.3mpg @ 30mph 34.3mpg @ 31mph 33.7mpg @ 30mph 33.8mpg @ 30mph 33.9mpg @ 33mph Each set of the figures above were from full tanks of gas (about 400 miles per tank). As you can see, most of the driving was city driving and the TDI is pretty consistent at around 34 MPG. I have yet to use a full tank on the highway but I typically see MPG figures in the mid 40's when charging around the flatlands of the Sacramento area doing 65-75 MPH. Love this car!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car replaces a Honda Civic DX. When my wife said she wanted a new car, and it "had to get better mileage than her Honda", the search was on. We spend a couple of weeks a year in Europe, and know how developed the Turbo Diesel is in Europe. While Hybrid's are interesting, its repair costs are questionable - most likely one won't be repairing, they will be replacing components. I had heard from friends who have TDi's how much they liked them. The TDi is positioned as the top of the line model - with all of the bells and whistles. This car impresses me more every time I drive it. It accelerates at every speed with gusto, and averages about 44+ mpg on a 25 mile one way trip.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I also have a Honda Civic Hybrid but the Jetta TDI for the same money is much more fun and better quality. The diesel engine has tremendous low end torque and the turbo is rocket fast in sport mode. Just did a round trip from San Diego to LA and back and averaged 46 mpg. Been getting in the mid 30 mpg around town. The three mode transmission is fun for whatever mood. Leave it in D for economical commuting, drop it into sport to zip through traffic and manually shift when in the mountain twisties. Good seats with nice bun warmers and plenty of room for my 6 foot frame. Feels like a BMW or Audi for many thousands less. With free service and tax rebates how can I go wrong?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Being single and sixty the last thing I wanted was one of the classic "family" cars even though I like the reliability of Hondas and Toyotas. Nor did I want a classic "geezer pleaser" (Avalon/Lexus). Not wanting to pay the price for a BMW I find this Wolfsburg Jetta to be an excellent compromise. The 2L turbo engine is sweet with strong response and quite decent mileage even if it does require premium. I try not to look to closely at the Consumer Reports reliability charts as all German cars appear to be lacking but I previously had an '04 Jetta GLS that never skipped a beat in 50K miles! I have no reason to think this Jetta won't be just as reliable but time will tell.</TEXT>

We drove the Jetta SE, and were delighted by all the standard features. We were especially delighted with the ESP and the way it handled in snow. Very important in Michigan. When we got to the lease payment, I quickly realized that for $50 more per month than I was paying for my GM car we could lease 2 Jettas. So we did!

<TEXT>This is an excellent car for the money. The standard features include 10 speaker stereo, heated seats. The fit and finish is superb for a $21990 car. The EPA mileage ratings are totally incorrect. This car easily gets over 40 mpg in mixed driving. You will easily get in the high 40's or even 50 mpg on the highway if you drive carefully. The car handles well, is stable and feels very secure.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With gas close to $4 a gallon, I decided it was time to part company with my SUV, so while at a local area VW Dealer picking up my son?s Rabbit, I took a look at the ?09 TDI sedan. Shopped around for about a month and then went back and purchased one. I have one of the original ones sent out to the dealers as a preview, white minus the green leaf decals, with their new outstanding automatic transmission. I couldn?t be happier with this car, great mileage, 36 mpg city, and it handle like a true euro built driving machine. By the way, after only 2,500 miles the fuel mileage should improve once the engine is broke in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were looking for a replacement for our Volvo XC70. Wanted something not quite as large, but with lots of utility and better fuel economy. The Jetta TDI Sportwagon is the ideal size vehicle for us...room for our dog with the rear seats up and some hauling from time to time. Many crossovers don't have the room this VW Sportwagen does. But the real deal is the TDI engine. Our first trip was across Washington state and back when the car was new. Got 43 MPG overall and its getting better. The new automatic is so smooth you can only tell the shift points by looking at the tach. The seating positions are very comfortable for a long trip and the car is quiet with little road noise.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sunroof is great. And lots of storage compartments. And the safety ratings are high. Again, the TDI engine is really something. Lots of torque at low end for off the line acceleration. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our third TDI and first sedan. We still have an 05 wagon but will be trading for a new sport wagon in late spring of 09. Our 03 wagon saved my wife's life when she was T-boned and ended up upside down 100 yards down the road. Not a scratch, a very safe car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 6 speed auto is fun though if you are fuel conscious you will not overly use it's sport feature, but man you fly when you do. Like the satellite radio, and the display is classic volks.

<TEXT>This is the first car I have owned that isn't American. I struggled to find a happy medium with price, high fuel mileage & satisfaction with the size/interior of a new car. My Ford was 10 years old & I wanted the next car to last that long. After lots of online research & many test drives, I wanted a '09 Jetta TDI in theory, but needed to drive one once they hit the street. It was love at first drive. The car is substantial, feels solid, not much noise & I don't feel like I'm driving a tin-can. Other cars get similar mileage, but don't have the "pep," feel as safe or have the quality. The standard equipment is great. I love my Jetta TDI & I'm working on my guilt for not buying American.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've just passed 6000 miles and I really enjoy this vehicle. I see no drawbacks from the diesel -- except that diesel is a about a dollar more a gallon than gas these days. I spend a lot less time at the gas pump -- I get over 500 miles on a tank and I put in less than 13 gallons a fill-up. The DSG transmission is well matched to the engine and the throttle response is smooth and powerful enough to inspire confidence for all merging and passing situations. The steering and road feel is good, and it takes the road bumps well. All in all I'm very happy with this car to date. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Fun to drive! The fuel economy is much better than the EPA estimates. So far I am averaging 37+mpg in my daily commute (70%city, 30%highway) and when I go strictly highway I'm averaging 46mpg. And the amazing thing is that it should improve as the engine breaks continues to break in (have 4500 miles so far). Glad I picked this over a hybrid -- much more power and the trunk size is unbelievable! The Jetta is comfortable during my day-to-day commute and also during road trips. It easily fits four 6-footers with no performance lag. The engine noise is even less than my friend's '08 Passat 2.0T and no one can believe that it's a diesel until they look at the badging. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have now had my TDI Sportwagen for one and half months. I have 6500 miles and average about 38 mpgs overall. I keep a fully loaded car for sales promotion items from the back of the front seats to the back door and getting an average of 38mpgs. I can't imagine what I would get with a car that did not have a heavy load daily. It is very sporty, handles well and I am very pleased. I would recommend that you give this car a drive if looking for an economical option to the SUV. I am still saving about 30-40 dollars a month on gas even though there is a 80 cent spread between unleaded regular and diesel.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With all the attention on the TDI, the SEL is perhaps the most unsung bargain in the Sportwagen lineup. With the same 2.0T engine (and sporty-sounding noise pipe) as the GTI and GLI, the SEL is a blast to drive. It's loaded with leather/memory seats, dual climate control, Premium sound, Sirius radio, sporty 17-inch wheels, Highline instrument cluster, and a myriad other options not found on any other Jetta. Mine has the enormous moonroof that is actually best appreciated in the backseat due to its size. The cargo space is amazing--more room behind the rear seat than a Passat wagon. Rowing through the six-speed manual transmission and feeling the rush of acceleration is great. What a car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I enjoy driving our new Jetta TDI. We have been achieving 33 mpg in city driving and 43 mpg on the highway as long as the auto is driven sensibly. The new diesel is much quieter than we expected, and there is almost no odor on start-up, even on 20 degree mornings! The seats are a bit larger than the older style Jetta, but are still firm and comfortable. Rear legroom has also improved. While I would not classify this auto as a true sports car, it does handle well. The fit and finish of the interior is excellent, and all controls are well placed. Overall, we are happy with our purchase. It's a lot of car for $23,000.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was really impressed with the Diesel as an alternative to a hybrid. I had a Civic Hybrid that was a great car, but had no guts when you needed it. This car has it in spades. The diesel's torque makes for a much more pleasant driving experience while returning similar fuel economy. The only thing I can't figure out is a high pitched noise that is constantly going. It's not the turbo. This noise is coming from the rear passenger quarter of the car and is especially noticeable after shutting off the engine. No one else seems to hear it, but it makes my ears feel like they've been screamed in after I drive it. Hopefully, it's a break-in issue that will go away.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a unique blend of qualities. Nice design and build. Nice interior. Great fuel economy (30 to 40)and nice performance from this drive train. Fun transmission that can drive like a manual in sport mode. Good handling from this zippy car. From 0 to 50 mph this car is quick which is not expected with this kind of economy. It also has Audi interior cues such as info center on dash. It is the same as my A6. No diesel smell or noise. Pleasantly surprised from a former BMW 328 owner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this car in PA and drove it home to SC. I took secondary roads all the way home to make sure it got broken in properly and I still got 43 MPG. I am very happy with the comfort, fit and finish, and fuel economy and I love the DSG. I can barely feel it shift. The car drives firmer than my old Caddy but in a good way. It just feels more solid and it's certainly as comfortable. My only concern is long term reliability since I've read about earlier generation Jettas having some significant quality issues. Only time will tell if VW has improved on the quality.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The muti-function display is great. Among other parameters it provides distance to empty, average mpg, and instantaneous mpg. It's fun experimenting with various throttle techniques and watching the instantaneous mpg display. With immediate feedback it's easy to learn how to maximize economy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>1 week into owning this car and I couldn't be happier. I'm shocked at the power this car has. My last car was a GTI VR6, granted it had over 120k but this TDI has just as much pick up. I have full confidence powering into traffic from a stop. This is a simple, elegant and very well designed car that inherits many technical, structural and visual cues from Audi.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I'm loving the factory nav. It's a very nice system. I'm surprised at how much a like the satellite radio, it's fantastic. I'm still getting used to the automatic transmission after driving stick for 12 years, but having the tiptronic option is great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded a 2003 Jetta TDI for this and it is everything the 2003--that I liked--was times 4. Mine has only the gorilla mats option and I can't think of anything else I would have wanted. The quality is much better than the 2003 (fit, finish, etc). The electronics are superb. Road sound is almost non-existent. The engine is just fantastic. Great power and quiet. I get 36 MPG on the low side and 46+ on the highway. I average around 39-40 and NOTHING is flat where I live, all up and down hills. In a flat region of the country, I have no doubt 50+ MPG would be easy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Favorite feature: easy, the engine. It pulls hard from anything above 1500 RPM. Passing is a breeze. You get better mileage than hybrids and you don't have to sacrifice any performance. This diesel is a sports car to drive. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Convenience features leave me a bit unimpressed, considering the high cost. Mostly manual seat adjustments, no steering wheel audio controls, and a really annoying radio electronic lockout feature. With diesel fuel now up to 30% higher than normal gas, the fuel economy advantage is questionable. Given a 30% price diff, if you get 45 mpg, a 35 mpg gas burner costs you pretty close the same. You need to use an expensive specialty motor oil. Clean diesel? I can sniff a tiny whiff of diesel exhaust as I am driving, so folks with respiratory issues may want to pay very careful attention to this during a test-drive. (Maybe some residue on the engine that will burn off eventually.)</TEXT>

<TEXT>Teutonic styling, handling and quality. Stiff suspension and taut handling takes some getting used to but lots of smiles per km. Fuel economy averages 6 L/100 km out of the box in a mixture of highway driving and city. Doors close with a reassuring thud. Interior controls and finish are all of the highest quality. Everything works as it's supposed to. Expensive trim level (Highline) and options (Sirius radio etc.) worth the upgrade. TDI is luxury car quiet and smooth. 6 speed manual takes some getting used to with closely matched ratios. Best to find a high range and leave it there, letting the 235 ft lb torque do the rest. Only missed feature is HID headlights, standard H4 are very good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car for the money. It is very fuel efficient, for those who have only managed to get in 350 or so miles, the mileage does improve drastically over time. I average mid 40's for primarily 50 mph driving on country backroads, and high 30s in city driving. I decreased my weekly gas bill for my Subaru from 180 dollars to my current 52.00 per week! That cannot be beat, and it only requires one fill per week, with me driving 600 miles per week on average. My only complaint is that I have 3500 miles so far, and the check engine light just came on. The dealer has been very helpful, but I am a bit concerned that maybe they have not yet worked out the kinks in the new engine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove pretty much every small to midsized Japanese sedan before buying the Jetta. The only cars that came close in their standard configurations were the Nissan Sentra-S and Altima. The VW's features, handling, and interior quality were well above anything else I tested. Plenty adequate acceleration, torque-y little engine, great handling, and a well-crafted overall package. It feels faster than it is, but that's good because it's really easy to misbehave in this car. A nice entry point into German-designed cars - sporty, solid, and wonderfully engineered. A classy commuter that's also fun to buzz the backroads with on the weekend.</TEXT>

Toyota's hybrids are great at what they do, but I couldn't imagine driving one on a daily basis. This is my first VW, and I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of the diesel option in the new Tiguan so my wife can have a little fun.

<TEXT>This is my third Jetta.

So overall, i'd say that this new Wolfsburg is the best overall. It has huge amount of power. I love the way the engine sounds in the freeway when I'm speeding up a bit. I got the red Salsa and it's great. Although i do miss a few features that the previous model but it's okay. As far as fuel efficiency, it's not that great especially during aggressive driving and driving up the hill. But it's better than driving an SUV. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got my 2009 Jetta TDI [DSG] and I love it! It's a great little car. Even brand new I've been averaging over 50 mpg on the highway during my commute. The styling is nice, not great, but nice. The interior is very well laid out, with controls in easy to access, but not necessarily see, locations. The DSG, although an "automatic" transmission, shifts like a manual and it takes some getting used to if you have never driven before. The degree of engine braking as the car downshifts back into first was startling the first few times. I'm looking forward to getting even better mileage after the engine is fully broken-in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very solid build. The 6 speed manual is very smooth and really lets you enjoy the torque of the diesel. I live in south Florida and the sunscreen over the panoramic sunroof actually does keep it cool inside. I am 6'6" and have plenty of headroom and my kids can still sit behind me. First tank was 39.5 mpg with 60% highway. I have seen over 50 mpg over long stretches at 72-75 mph. </TEXT>

<TEXT>As an owner of an ?84 300D Turbo Diesel Benz for over 10 years, I knew it would be worth waiting for the ?09 Jetta TDI. Two weeks after purchasing my Loyal Edition, I remain extremely satisfied. This car has amazing torque output! I can feel the quiet diesel engine purring under the hood as it speeds effortlessly down the road. The firm ride adds to the feel that I'm driving a tamed beast! Months of research convinced me that no other car gives you the value the TDI offers. At an average of 44.7 mpg on the highway this past weekend, I am convinced this is an unbeatable deal that will last for years to come.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seamless DSG transmission, incredible fuel efficiency, AWESOME sound system with MP3/6-CD changer, blue & red nighttime lights on the dashboard, leatherette feels like real leather (it's easier to clean), very high safety rating, 236 lbs. of torque at 1750-2750 rpm (that's ALL the time)! Amazing car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I picked up a new 2009 Wolfsburg 2.0T with the 6sp automatic a about 5 days ago and still have nothing to say about the car other than it's great. The interior design is well laidd out and comfortable. The red led lighting from the overhead console is a nice touch for driving at night. Outside the car design just looks sharp, love the unique wheels. Performance is great, trading in a 2006 GTI 1.8T 5 sp manual, I was not expecting the power this car has, but it does put a smile on your face. So far the first couple tanks of gas has given me an average of 30.1 mpg that too was a great surprise as well. The mpg should get a little better when things break in a little more. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I picked up my new TDI Loyalty Edition last week after waiting about 2 months for it and have driven it about 350 miles so far and I absolutely love the handling and torque. So far I am doubtful that I will see the 45+ mpg I was hoping for, unless it improves after it is broken in. I have been avg about 35 mpg combo city/hwy. I have been driving a little aggressively, so maybe there is some upside. I do like the car and it handle very well for a sedan. Great value and economy. Here's hoping for better mileage! </TEXT>

This year Volkswagen added a power seat for the driver along with the heated seats for both passenger and drive. If you can buy this car, buy it. I paid $27,300 as this car has dealer mark ups.

Not opened it up yet but wow half throttle and it really goes. Seats are mostly comfortable, I haven't been able to get mine exactly where I want it. The only things I would change would be fuel economy readout in dash and steering wheel controls for the radio. I love it and look forward to driving it every morning.

<TEXT>I was considering hybrids, but heard about this one coming out. I'm glad I waited. It has tremendous acceleration and great handling. The computer showed that I got 44.3 mpg on a 300 mile trip. I'm still over half a tank plus I drove around all day today. The engine is quiet and clean. I've seen older tdis spouting dirty smoke, but this one does not. There is also a minimal amount of noise. If you are inside, you can't hear it at all at idle. When you punch the throttle, this thing takes off. A lot of push. I notice it especially around 20-30 mpg like trying to get on freeway. It is peppy! The materials are as good as the bmw 650i we own. Just don't confuse the fuel!</TEXT>

The car is my office, and this one is not as comfortable as the '05. I am an outside sales rep, and I drive A LOT. The "clean" is fun to drive, the sound system is better, it has more features in the dash, which I like. So far I have used 1/4 tank of fuel according to the gage, we shall see how that continues to play out. Overall, I really like the "clean".

<TEXT>Coming from a Legacy GT I was worried that the power wouldn't be there. However mated with the 6 speed manual it is plenty of zip and performs just fine in the mountains near Denver. The 1 regret is the gearing on the vehicle for higher speed driving. For customers that need to avg. 80 mph you won't get the typical 42 mpg I have been calculating. The best mpg - avg speed hovers around 60 - 63 mph which correlates to 50 mpg. Overall I am happy so far, 6,600 miles in the fuel costs are excellent and always try to get 600 miles to the tank. Pricing makes it hard to say no and the gov. incentives are nice. The only problem I foresee is taking it in for service, I've heard horror stories.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving a Ford Crown Victoria for 18 years, it is going to take a while to get used to a smaller car where I feel and hear more of the road than I would like. The 16-inch rims and low profile tires give the car a sporty feel but I prefer the smoother ride of a large sedan. I took the Mercury Milan Hybrid on a test drive first but it was priced too high. It was smoother and quieter than the Jetta. I am impressed with the fuel efficiency after 500 miles. I am getting 34 mpg city and 47 highway while driving between 65-70 mph. When the piston rings are seated and the car is more broken in, I expect to do better. </TEXT>

Cheapskate that I am, I put $500 down on a 2010 Prius which wasn't yet in the dealerships. I finally had a chance to drive the Prius and was moderately disappointed, so I went 10 minutes down the road and test drove the 2009 Jetta TDI. The driving experience was simply night and day. I expect that the Prius would have been more trouble-free and about the same cost per mile as the Jetta, I just couldn't bring myself to buy the Prius.

<TEXT>This is my first Diesel car. Like anyone who is considering the GAS vs. DIESEL debate we read so many online articles that we eventually got a headache. First Impression - We now have 700 miles on the car and on a 80 mile highway trip I averaged 42 mpg - driving 60-70 mph. Driving 75 or higher mpg dropped slightly. I have not been able to judge the city mileage yet. For anyone that is considering one best advice - test drive one. Great handling, good features, low road noise, and European design. Until I have to fill up I don't even realize I am driving a diesel. If diesel prices stay were they have been for my last three top offs it should pay for itself very quickly.

<TEXT>The ratings I base on any car that's as fuel efficient as this one. Much more fun to drive than a hybrid, yet gets nearly the same mileage. Spacious, back seat fits adults, seats comfortable on a 1400 mile, three day trip. Be wary of the hype that the car will get over 50 mpg. Trying real hard I can get 45 - 46. Around town I've been getting much better than I'd guessed, 38 - 40. I have the manual and keep the car at 1500 rpms unless going uphill. Never needs to be at more than 2000 rpms unless in top gear, passing or entering a freeway. Averaging 70 mph you will be lucky to exceed 41 mpg. It's in the constant 50s and 60s that 46+mpg is possible.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Jetta in general closely approximates an entry level luxury sedan while being priced closer to more basic sedans. The TDI drive train provides tremendous performance with exceptional mileage (40+ mpg is easily obtained driving gently). At idle it sounds different than a gasoline engine but not objectionable. There is no diesel smell. Its acceleration and responsiveness are impressive. The trunk is large and easily accessible with a pass through for long objects. The cabin is comfortable for four. This car deserves to be very popular. I see no good reasons not to consider it if looking for a mid sized sedan.</TEXT>

Much shopping/research went on and the VW TDI SportWagen was the Ace of Hearts that we were looking for so the BMW went bye-bye. I look forward to driving this car everyday and thank God I was lucky enough to find one on the lot on my first visit to the VW dealer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Higher MPG than my old car & price of Diesel is a no brainer. Sporty looking and my daughter loves the 52" sunroof. Definitely roomy for the kids & their stuff. Not noisy/smelly like the old diesel cars. Normal size spare tire. Navigation w/DVD player. Great response when taking off (Turbo)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Jetta wagon. Had fun purchasing and driving it. Left the dealership with 25 miles on it. 12 days later, at 540 miles the car beeped, red light flashed, air conditioning blew hot air. The needle on the temp gauge went to 260! all the way to the right. VW road service came. Towed the car to dealer. Needless to say, the thrill of the new car is gone, and doubt has set in. Until then I loved the car. Now I worry about reliability and high repair costs after warranty wears out. Dealer handling it well, just a disappointment to me that the car had problems before I even got my license plates.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just picked up my Jetta TDI Sportswagon last week and so far I'm loving it. Fun to drive, handles great, the turbo is a real kick. Perfect size after driving mini-vans for the last 19 years. Plenty of cargo area in the back, seats are comfortable. A/C works great and cools down the car within a couple of minutes. So far I'm still on my first tank of gas but at 175 miles I've only used a quarter of a tank of gas. Nice to finally have a car I look forward to driving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded a 2005 Avalon Touring for a Sportswagon TDi. I got a good deal on my trade-in and $1300 tax CREDIT for buying a high mileage car! These cars are a little hard to find though. Routine Maintenance is covered for 3 years. I was looking for a car that I loved to drive. This feels like most other German engineered cars..tight, precise handling, good firm ride, and a unique driving experience. The last car I enjoyed driving this much was my CTS. This car broke the Guiness 48 state mileage world record..58.8mpg! Now you wont get this kind of mileage, expect 35-38 general driving, and 45-48 on the interstate. But this little turbo diesel is wonderful! Powerful, quiet and extremely efficient</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is a great car for the money! It is also a great car to throw around, handles like a dream. I went to the VW dealer with the intend of buying a used A4. So far I'm not regretting the decision to by a new Jetta when it comes time to make the monthly payment. I would think the gas mileage for this size of car should be better. But the gas mileage is coming in as advertised (plus its too much fun driving this car with a heavy foot).</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought it to replace my wife's 1999 Olds Cutlass with 51,000 miles bought new from the same dealer 10 years go. We compared it to the Prius and the VW SportWagonTDI won. We just finished our 1st long trip (800 miles) in it and are totally satisfied. Keep in mind my car is a 2004 GMC Denali all wheel drive and loaded. I am 6'7" tall and 280 lbs the VW has plenty of room. It has as much head room as my Denali. We averaged 33.6 MPG calculated from gas tickets after driving 80-90 mph on Interstate and 4o-60 MPH on two lane roads from Savannah to Apacatchacola. It is not even broken in yet and the mpg is impressive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The '09 Jetta diesel is powerful, economical, safe, and well-built. Forget the EPA rating, you'll get 40-45 MPG driving sensibly. Just note it is not a car for short-commute city drivers; stop-and-go and short commutes where the engine never warms up will cream your mileage (though you should still see mid-to-high 30s). This is a full-sized powerful sedan that handles like a luxury car but gives the same or better fuel economy than toy cars such as the 'Smart' or any hybrid you care to name. Do yourself a favor and test-drive it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So I bought this car in April and just got it back the other day after it being fixed for a month. At the end of May I was on the Interstate and hit a deer in the left lane...Airbags went off and I spun into the middle lane because the deer hit me from the side/quarterpanel. The airbags didn't hurt me. I was fine, and I was lucky, but I think this car kept me safe because it pretty much crunched in to absorb all the impact. I was sad to see my brand new car smashed up but I was OK, and now it's fixed so it doesn't matter. I had a Jetta when I was 17 and got into an accident with that too. They are built to keep you safe. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Had to take back to dealer after 450 miles when engine light came on. Oxygen sensor needed to be replaced. First non-Japanese car so I'm hoping reliability isn't too much of an issue. Purchased for gas mileage, sporty nature and uniqueness, durability of diesel engine. I drive many highway miles. Standard radio has very tinny sound, not for listening to music. Will need to upgrade. Air conditioning is weak. Vents hardly blow out much cold air. No complaints about the ride, acceleration or gas mileage. Feels solid and looks good. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am still breaking in the car with only 120 miles driven. I am impressed by the engine and DSG transmission. Very smooth shifts while accelerating, and seems to find the correct gear for each situation. However,at very low speeds there is too much engine braking due to no fluid coupling so some small amount of lurching is sensed. The interior is very attractive and seems well made. The only complaint thus far is the front seats which are too hard. I hear this is a German car trait, but this doesn't impress my behind. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The car and dealership are excellent overall. My only concern is as follows: The trani started leaking fluid from the bell housing at 730 miles and when I brought it to the dealer, it was diagnosed as a seal problem with internal damage. A new transmission was installed which VW approved and shipped to the dealer quickly. The dealer paid for a rental car while the Jetta was being repaired. The car was returned in excellent condition after four days and now runs perfectly with no leaks. The car has so many positive qualities and the dealer handled the situation professionally. I would definitely buy another car from the dealer even though this was an unusual and disturbing event. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my '09 Jetta TDI sedan in January and I just passed 10K miles a few weeks ago. Recently took it in for the FREE 10K service, which is a nice plus, as the '09 comes with 36K no charge service. So far I love it! The ride is smooth, somewhat tight, and very easy to handle. Acceleration is phenomenal considering the mpg. The diesel is quiet but has a nice exhaust note when pushed. Fit and finish are near perfect. The seats are very comfortable but not soft and cushy. The dash is clean and un-cluttered. Plenty of room for even the tallest drivers, but a smallish back seat. The trunk is decent size and pass through storage is handy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The DSG transmission is fantastic and fun to drive. In sport mode it's really fast, but I usually keep it in D for better mpg. Downshifts while breaking on downhills. Fuel mileage is awesome. Rated at 30/40, I average 38 in mixed driving, and easily get 44 on long trips. Sirius Radio</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have put almost 12,000 miles on this car and have enjoyed it with one exception. . They actually found out that this car, being one of the first manual TDI wagons, was running too clean and choking itself. It behaved much better after the EGR valve replacement. Fussy clutch in 1st until it was broken in. It likes to hiccup after startup during the first minute the engine is warm.(Part of EGR software issue) A software upgrade was performed last week, but still have the problem. I drive aggressively and get 32 MPG around town,36 HWY. Drove 525.5 miles on one tank road trip and got 41.2 MPG . A great highway cruiser and fun to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was in the market for either a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. The prices were too much. I found the Jetta 2009 Wolfsburg AM and took it for a test drive and was VERY impressed. Very close to the Audi. Great car bumper to bumper and the dealership (Palisades) was great unlike the BMW and Audi dealerships I went to. This car is very responsive with great handling. It is the Audi A4 without all the glamor and that is ok with me because I saved the extra $13-$15K in my pocket. You will not find a similar sedan in American or Japanese for the price.</TEXT>

Had a small rattle from the seat belt but it was quickly replaced at the dealer. Installed studded snow tires to battle the Utah snow and it never misplaced me. First gear with a manual trans is a bit touchy around town but quite fun otherwise. If you are in stop and go traffic, go for the automatic. Don't let the fake leather stop you from buying, it actually looks pretty nice and no one ever questions otherwise. Would definitely buy over again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned this car for approximately 3 months. I have 10,856 miles on the odo. The average "real world" economy w/o soft peddling (driving like hybrid owners) is 36.5 mpg combined cycle of which I would say 80% of my miles are highway. I feel that this car could give much higher fuel economy by simply adding a 7th gear or OD for the highway. If you drive the vehicle, you will notice that the engine revs at a higher rpm. With diesel engines having very good low end torque, dropping the revs by 400 rpm could boost fuel economy to a level that could surpass any hybrid in the market.</TEXT>

With diesel now lower priced than gas here in our state, and teh difference in mileage, we will keep running our 2002 for a long time to come. After VW screwed up and lowered the mileage, find yourself a 2002 or 2003 TDI diesel if you can and buy that instead.

Car is very comfortable, great seats, firm ride, low wind/road noise, and loved the Sirius satellite radio. Transmission is very smooth and going up and down hills on the interstate through upstate Pennsylvania (very hilly) did not upset this transmission or cruise control. Always smooth and had plenty of power, with no straining or slowing on the hills. All the controls are simple and easy to use without taking your eyes off the highway.

<TEXT>We got this TDI last month it is a great car. It is put together well, the engine pulls hard. We haven't broken the engine in all the way yet and we've been getting 35-41 mpg mixed. Everything on the dash is laid out nicely, easy to reach.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After waiting for 4 months I got my TDI in early December. We have about 6500 miles on it now and have had no problems whatsoever. We usually drive around town averaging 36 to 38 MPG. I drove on a highway trip of about 200 miles and got 49.6 MPG keeping the speed to no more than 65. We really enjoy driving the car. It handles well and is very comfortable. The 6 months of free satalite radio was a plus I didn't expect. The height adjustable seats are great. I'm a little taller than the wife and with both of us driving the car it makes it easier to get a comfortable driving position. We really enjoy the car. If your thinking about buying one check it out! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration, Sat. radio (sounds pretty good to us especially the sat), heated seats, 3yr 36K free service, no tune ups - ever, sunroof, driving it, the ride and of course the MPG</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am a 76 yr old that still likes performance. The acceleration is amazing. And that is the only thing that will make you realize it is a diesel. However maintaining speed in traffic is annoying. Especially when braking. It seems the auto transmission wants to help slow you down. This should make the brakes last , but a real pain trying to maintain driving distance. The cruise control must have been designed by Mr Volkswagen's kid. Long over due for modernization. The wipers are backwards to every one else's. Fuel cap is on right side, real handy AARGH </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet engine, even quieter than the gas during normal acceleration. Got 40mpg on the only tank I used before trading back to Sonata. That was 200 miles hwy and about 300 city. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought TDI after putting too much thought and reading excellent reviews buy other proud owners. I would say they are spot on!! this is a very fun to drive car amazing torque and handling zipping around in city is a blast do not under estimate the low end torque you absolutely do not need to rev to pass or make a quick lane change. averaged about 4o MPG on a 800 mile HWY trip cruising 65-75 mph, still breaking in, I heard it takes about 5000 miles for diesel to just break-in</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MPG, solid feel, and the fact reducing my carbon foot print on the environment $$ Tax savings :))</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the ESP which makes winter driving less scary for me: a noticeable improvement on my last car, a Sentra that performed horribly in winter weather, no matter how careful I was. It will even let you know when the tire pressure is low. Throw in heated seats, heated sideview mirrors, an outside temperature gauge and a nice, non-plasticy interior and the 2009 Jetta becomes a classier economy car. I stick with premium gas. Yeah, I know it's more expensive but it all comes out in the wash. The fuel efficiency on premium is noticeably better and I can actually accelerate up steep inclines even without putting the transmission into S. It's comfy, too. Instant comradery with other VW drivers.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>ESP, apparently standard on all 2009 VW models, is great! The sensors adjust tire rotation when one wheel slips (in winter weather, for instance) and synchronizes rotation to improve traction or it will apply slight breaking pressure to the wheel if slipping when accelerating to provide stability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Who needs an SUV? I work for a band and haul equipment all the time, but wanted something a little smaller for parking downtown. The VW wagon ticked both boxes, and was actually the roomiest wagon in this price range. If you can swing for the diesel, do it, but the base 5-cylinder has quite a bit to recommend it. Throw in standard heated seats and a telescoping wheel and you get a very refined and functional package for not a lot of money. Tall guys fit well, and legroom in the back is decent. Spring for the winter floor mats. Niggles are few. First gear is too short, and gas mileage isn't what it should be for a car this size. Still, I'd buy it again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great stereo, fit and finish is out of its price range. Wheel has a nice heft in character with the torquey motor and stiff suspension. Very little body roll on a turn. Storage and seats are well thought out.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I leased my Jetta because VW offered a too good to pass offer. I got an S model with roof and wheels. It is a great looking car and I get a lot of compliments on it. It is a lot of fun to drive. I have the 5 spd. and the performance is great. I am a former SCCA road racer and this car handles and drives great. The features this car has at this price point is unbelieveable. It is one of the best cars I have ever owned and there is nothing about it I don't like. Porsche obviously has fixed the problems that VW was known for, and this car is a huge value for the money. I have driven many more expensive cars, but few have more features than this VW. A great buy for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my car for about a week and am very happy with it. My first half-tank of diesel has gotten me 350 miles! Beyond that, it's a car with excellent fit-and-finish, great sound, smooth ride, and a classy feel. It feels like I bought a much more expensive car. There is plenty of room for four people, and there is ample hip, shoulder, and leg room. The car is fun to drive, has unbelievable torque and accelerates nicely.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car mainly for commuting duty (90% highway driving) as I drive 65 miles daily round-trip. The DSG transmission is extremely smooth and a good investment. The ride is smooth and comfortable at highway speeds. The combined package of high mpg, comfortable ride, good handling, safety features, cargo room, resale value, and $1300 tax credit made it a no-brainer for me. The only problem was finding one. I found the exact car I wanted, but it had the DVD/Nav. I decided to buy anyway to avoid the 3- 4 month wait of a factory order. I've only been driving the car a few days, but I really like it don't regret the purchase. Feels more Audi-like than my 2006 BMW 330i.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The last car I owned that was actually fun to drive was a 1988(?) VW Jetta. This car may not be quite in that class but it's hella more fun to drive than the trucks and SUVs I've had over the past 20 years or so. My reliability rating is based on only 1 week of ownership, but so far so good. Since nothing has gone wrong, I give it a 10.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>TDI TurboDiesel is amazing. And so far I love the DSG transmission. It's the best of both worlds. Expect an easy 45 MPG on the open road if you keep your speed down to about 60.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great gas mileage and plenty of power. Runs so quiet you would never know it was a diesel. Heated seats are comfortable for a small car. I'm glad we settled with the VW TDI. We couldn't be happier with this car as of now. Love all the safety features built into the car. The auto-transmission gears down like no car I have ever driven. Fun to drive and responsive. Why would anyone buy a hybrid when you can drive the VW TDI.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats, Lots of power, comfortable, lots leg room, big trunk, looks great, awesome gas mileage, plenty of options to choose from. Love our Jetta TDI</FAVORITE>
