<TEXT>This Edge is my first cross over. I replaced a Hemi Durango so I was hoping for better fuel milage. So far this thing rocks. plenty of power with great manners, and lots of room for a 6'3 guy. Brakes are a little weak for such a light car. </TEXT>

<TEXT> After owning four GM Suv"s in a row, I tried the Edge feeling the GM line had fallen behind. I have been very impressed with the vehicle itself but disappointed in some of the "amenities". The IP is very difficult to see in low light conditions-this in itself will prevent a repurchase as both drivers feel it is dangerous. The radio (LED) is archaic ,difficult to read . The privacy cover behind the back seat is a joke. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Styling is great - the interior is well built and simple but classy / refined - no overdone plastic wood - no rattles or excessive wind noises - I have the vista roof - just a great feel and view - it is just like the SRX roof - the Sync system for the phone is a 10 - clear - understands every word - still have not interfaced the ipod yet - I drive a lot 3/4 highway - 22+ MPG - use the overdrive button for getting off the highway - it will downshift - save brakes for the long run - I do 40K a yr - one negative for me is no manual shifting of the automatic. Roof was worth the trade off - so far very quite and firm but car like ride - I test drove them all and when I drove the Edge, SOLD!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>vista roof, sync system better than onstar due to bluetooth connection, ride quality - visibility- backup sensors, automatic tail gate - seat configuration, seat comfort I am 6ft 240lbs, chrome wheels, very good headlights and fog lights,tight steering - spot car like, very comfortable for long rides</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Cash for Clunkers combined with rebates and dealer discount, I could not be anymore happier with my purchase. The ride is quiet, smooth and handles well, practically glides over bumps, potholes & train tracks. Front seats are very comfortable. Lumbar support adds comfort on long trips. Synch makes it a car for the 21st century. Mileage could be better but, hey, at least it doesn't takes premium unleaded gas. The interior is spacious for passengers & cargo. Rear and front passenger seats fold down providing lots of room for trips to the hardware store. Comes with key fob so no more locking my keys in the car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Synch providing Satellite radio, navigation, Bluetooth, & current gas prices in the area you're in. Great sound system. Exterior design with chrome, shiny coat of paint, and head turning 20" rims. Panoramic roof.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had to replace a Jeep Grand Cherokee in a hurry and did not want another jeep. I think I made a mistake. Vehicle looks good and a has a smooth quiet ride, but the build and material quality is seems very cheap. The rear outer door handle feel like they could break off in your hand. Hard plastic throughout. probably wont keep for long. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am unhappy with the MPG in city driving. I struggle to get 14 MPG. Hwy driving at 70 MPH is great, over 25 MPG. My wife feels the passenger side seat does not slide back far enough to allow good leg room and it is hard for her to buckle the seat belt because the insert for the buckle is down to low. Other than that we enjoy the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I made the mistake of going for the best deal not the best automobile. My choice came down to Pilot or Edge and to save a few bucks went with the Edge. I am kicking myself now. Pilot was quieter, smoother, and had better quality materials especially interior. Can't believe I didn't notice only way to stop cruise is by braking. Edge looks nicer but quality wise doesn't compare.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am pleased with most things about this SUV. It gets over 25 MPG on the Hwy with average speed of 70 MPH, but in town I am very disappointed. In normal city driving it gets 13 to 14 MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I grew up with Ford trucks and station wagons. I currently own a 1997 F350 crew cab. The Edge is a totally new experience for me and my family. I can't get my wife out of the car, she's always on the road! My kids who normally think that their parents are "old" love it! Their computer Geek friends love SNYC and the other features. We love the ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The technology is AWESOME, the car is roomy, lot's of storage space, the sound systems is AWESOME, the drivers seat has a great view around, Satellite radio is cool, the sun roof is nicccccccccccccce.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been driving my Ford Edge Limited since March 09, and all I have to say so far is that I Love It!! The main reason why I picked it over the other vehicles I was considering was the technology package. You get so much more for the money compared to other vehicles. The exterior designed is powerful and I love the way it drives! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Panoramic Sun Roof; The Sync System is awesome!; Very roomy and comfortable inside; Heated front seat are great for those cold days; DVD system is great for long drives. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Edge is pretty much everything advertised. It handles well and is a very "tight" vehicle. The roominess in the rear seat is definitely superior to the GM Suv's I have owned. Overall , a great vehicle with the instrument panel lighting being the only "significant " shortfall. Without any backlighting, it is hard to read on a cloudy/overcast day or towards sunset. This lack of lighting is unusual in the Industry today.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a brand new 2008 Ford Edge back in March 2009 and I love the car. It feels like a real car. Its performace is awesome and not to mention its outside and inside design. Even my wife wants to drive my car more often than her Honda Pilot. The Sync system is great and if you are into technology, you will enjoy it even more. I must say that Ford really scored a 10+ on this one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync system, confort, looks and a good price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased a new Edge for my wife and we are both very satisfied with our choice. The car has great styling, feels very solid and drives and handles surprising well. You can't beat the comfort and roominess, especially in the back seat. Despite the complaints of some critics, I find the interior quality to be quite good and the materials seem very durable. The Edge equals or exceeds most of the foreign made equivalents that we tried and at a much better price after dealer and factory discounts. Have you driven a Ford lately?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation system with Sync, outside mirrors with blind spot inserts, sound system and plenty of room front and back.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I went from a Lincoln Mark-LT to the Ford Edge and so far I am very happy with my choice. People have commented that it looks like a Lexus and I think it rides like one too. I really like SYNC and all of it's associated features. It is roomy on the inside and is easy to maneuver. The turning radius is great. I also like the automatic liftgate. I have not had it on the highway yet but am averaging 18 MPG in the city. I expect to get around 25 on the highway. It has a lot of zip to it. I think Ford finally has a crossover SUV that can compete with Honda and Toyota brands. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the SYNC and the power liftgate. I also added a remote start to it which will be nice in the hot Texas summers. The cargo area has plenty of space for hauling especially when you put down the rear seats and fold the passenger seat foreword.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After months of car shopping and test driving the competition I handed my leased Escape back and drove home new Front Wheel Drive Edge Limited. Black with charcoal interior, vista roof, sync and chrome 18" wheels. Gotta say right now that the front wheel drive gets the mpg up there on the highway using cruise control. I read the book cover to cover and went out to set all my electronics and preferences. Filled it up, got on the parkway, pressed the reset button for the MPG function and took a 2 hour drive. Set the cruise control to 63mph and kicked back to some music. I got it up to 26 miles per gallon by the time I got back. Rpm,s were steady at 1600 for 63 mph so there's the reason.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, comfort, vista roof (no need for air deflector, it's built in already), sync, sound system and ambient lighting.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The sport model look got me! With factory 22" wheels & body kit, looks great from any angle. It transformed the ride/handling into something unlike any SUV/CUV. If you like the tight suspension, definitely consider the sport model. Interior is not the best, but with nav/sync, makes it a lot more fun. Lots of legroom front & back. Car still new, getting 17.5 mpg average, hope it will improve. Test driven Murano, Venza, Rav4, Tiguan, & Pilot, none look as good as this sport model.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Ford Edge based on looks, the Sync system, and Ford's recently emerging reputation for quality. So far I am very satisfied with the entire car as a whole. The drive is smooth and quiet with good acceleration when needed. The body styling is attractive in a timeless way. It looks masculine and beefy, unlike the CRV or the Vue, and it doesn't have any over-exaggerated curves that might make it dated in a few years, like the Murano. The interior is roomy, comfortable, and stylish (despite what some professional reviews say). The best part is the Sync system and touch- screen display--it makes the car fun to drive. Ford included all the right options for the price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Built-in 10G hard drive for music files! Touch-screen display; Sync system; 20" chrome wheels; power lift gate; heated seats; comfortable, smooth, quiet ride.</FAVORITE>
