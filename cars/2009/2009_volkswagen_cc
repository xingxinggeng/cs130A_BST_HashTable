<TEXT>Style is obviously good. But the interior (radio and environmental) is not that impressive. The fan comes on full speed with a twist of the temp control and other buttons/knobs... I find it pretty annoying. The leather seems pretty cheesy. If you put something lightly heavy on the seats it show an indentation forever. I have the std. Speaker system installed. The sound quality is not horrible, but its pretty bad. The speedo is also off by one mph. At night the interior lights do night dime enough. It gets pretty bright once your eyes adjust to dark.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I started looking at this car because of it's looks and also I like the idea of having a coupe-like sedan. The most impressive thing's about my CC so far is the build quality, the attention it receives and the fuel economy (avg 28). </TEXT>

<TEXT>I usually suffer from some buyer's remorse when I buy a car, but not this time. I just bought this car to replace an Infiniti I30T and I couldn't be happier. I had test driven the Lexus ES, BMW 3 series, Maxima and a few other cars and chose the CC for its styling, peppy engine (the 4-cylinder 2.0T is much quicker than the 6 cylinder I had on the I30), and price in comparison to other cars that were less sexy, had fewer features and were $5k to $10k more. I get more compliments on this car than others I have owned and people often wonder what type of car it is. I would definitely recommend (and have recommended) this car to others. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>-It's extremely comfortable and well designed from a driving perspective (controls are easy, seats a awesome); -Gas mileage (I average about 28 mph according to the computer) -Style - it is so much better looking that many higher priced cars -Price ('09 CC Sport Luxury with Nav for $29k)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my VW CC for 7 months now and I'm still in love with it. Not only does it perform and ride well, it's an attention getter. However, the issue of water retention in the rear doors is annoying. With every heavy rain, I'm opening the rear doors to release the water, and checking the floor for wetness. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Hello</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have already put over 10,000 miles on my new VW. I searched for awhile before purchasing it. I looked at new Honda Accord, new Nissan Altima, a used BMW 3 series and many more, but decided to go with the VW CC. This is the first VW I have ever owned. I have had it in the shop a couple of times already. The first problem was the speedometer was fluctuating. They replaced it with a new one, but I do notice it is off by one mile from the electronic display. The second and major issue is the doors are holding water. The back right side door especially is holding water. They are not sure how to fix it, but I did hear a service bulletin is coming out on this issue.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car. $70k style with $30k price. 2lt turbo is adequate. 4- seat concept is nice. It developed a water leak inside but VW of America called me to bring to the shop to have it fixed. They know now the door seals accumulate water and are fixing. Great styling outside and inside. Good motor. turbo boost. Great seats. I'm 5'9" married no kids and car is perfect for us. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at the Mercedes, BMW, Audi, and Acura's. The CC looks better than all of them, and has an incredibly large trunk, with a back-seat that also folds down. The technology package is awesome - even accepts a mini-flash card for music, and play's DVD movies while waiting. Another cool feature is the "auto-hold' brake. It automatically holds the car until you press the accelerator - great in rush hour traffic. This is a great car and excellent value. It's design will last at least 10 years or more. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>GPS, Hard drive player, DVD player, cornering headlights that auto-dim after the turn, style, seating, fold-down rear seat, large trunk, tech styling inside, awesome grill and rear deck. Perfect.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a wonderful car! VW has done a great job. Sleek,total head turner. I love that it has no model on the outside.One major flaw is water holding in the doors.Especially the rear doors. I noticed it immediately. After being washed or rain it holds in the doors. It will soak your shoes. Waited to have it address at the first free maintenance (10K). My area experienced a lot of rain a few days before taking it. I happened to notice the water is now inside the car. Back right floor board is soaked. I let the service man experience the woosh of water in the svc bay. They found water in the front as well. Now 3 days in the shop. They are clueless at this point. Send me suggestions!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The last Sports Sedan I owned was a 2004 Acura TSX. In my opinion, this car blows it away on performance and handling. From the satisfying grip of the steering wheel to its solid handling and acceleration, this car is a winner. I could feel the difference when I drove a new TSX and a 2010 Ford Fusion Sport. Two months ago I didn't know this model VW even existed. I can't understand why VW hasn't marketed this car like it has some of their other models. You have to test drive this car to really appreciate what it has to offer in terms of the driving experience. Simply amazing. I have had the CC for two weeks and have about 700 miles on the car with no complaints what so ever.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features besides the two- toned interior are the Bluetooth phone system, which is now a standard feature on the 2010 model; and the radio system is excellent. I especially like the touch screen channel changer. The rubber floor mats capture debris before it gets ground into the carpet. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the CC after unsuccessful attempts to find Jetta TDI wagon. distinctly different from my 03 passat,the CC looks great. the ride is typical VW firm,the interior is 9/10s Audi.seating is much better d/t power adjustments.I've always driven Man. trans-so I thought I'd do so again. After 2 test drives, I felt auto seems more appropriate. The vinyl (leatherette) feels fine but is probably not as durable as real leather. All in all a very sleek, comfortable long- distance cruiser. </TEXT>

<TEXT>5/7 220lb no problem getting in/out, plenty leg/head room. Drver Seat setting allows ample leg room rear seat rider. Config of the dash controls, 1st glance, easily found/used while driving. Over done interior electronics most I will never use. A good reason to get the warranty. VW should offer VR6 with less fluff. If they did I would have purchased that model instead. Performance/handling quite good both in twisties & on the slab. slow at the starts. Rougher back roads reminded me I was in a smaller car. Performance/steering wasnt inhibited crests/valleys are felt more. Mirror/through window views unobstructed. Ill be back with an updated review.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Follow-up review. 5 alignments, 4 new tires, replace rack & pinion component, balancing, 5 test drives, different technicians and only 1500 miles. What can I say, "lemon". Even after test drive with service techs and service manager which in fact concurs with me that car still pulls to the right. Service manager and VW rep states that this normal and is within specs. I say if this normal for this type of car it should be revealed to the customer, I myself wouldn't have bought it, who wants to buy new expensive tires and alignment often? if you do own this type of car, give it a test drive focusing on how straight the car drives when letting go of the wheel momentarily. Safety, utmost concern</TEXT>

<TEXT>bought car beginning of August. has been in shop longer than it has been at home. Alignment problem, let go of steering wheel and drifts drastically to the right. Service guy has been much help, even though 3 technicians have tried to resolve problem. Latest attempt was to replace all tires, another alignment, and balancing. We'll see what happens. Haven't had time to really test drive it myself since I've been out of town on business. Will keep you posted. Really like the style, inside and out, but we'll see.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Is it so wrong to want to sleep in my car? I went from a SUV to this, and it is a major shock. I can now accelerate on every corner instead of braking. It's very low to the ground, so it will take me a while to get used to. I bought the VR-6 Sport Blue Exterior, two toned leather interior with Nav, etc. I love the ride - very comfortable seats. The Nav system is awesome so if you can get it, do so. I'm a bit of a techie so there are plenty of buttons for me to push to satisfy the need. Yesterday I found out I have a USB port in my glovebox. I have a rearview camera that shows what's behind me when I go in reverse, and has lines to show what my path is depending on my wheel position. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So, I had to come back to Edmunds and write a review. We debated over the CC, and the somewhat comparably priced entry levels from Lexus, Infiniti, and Audi. Hard choice picking the VW over the "luxury" brands, but I have to tell you that it was definitely worth the name plate trade off. Extremely well built, solid car; very fun to drive, with a lot of pep for a 4-cylinder; like others have noted, unlike the entry level luxs, you will get plenty of looks. So many people have stopped my wife and me and asked what type of car it was, or just complimented the style and look. We bought a luxury model fully loaded (backup camera, bluetooth, nav, etc.) in the blue/gray. Would recommend to anyone. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Solidly built. Great style inside and out. Nav system is great, and easy to use. Get the backup camera, as the rear sight lines are not the best, plus it has a great backup guidance system. Good sound system with 30gb HD and media inputs. Lot of power out of the 4-cylinder turbo. Great gas mileage. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the car in February but waited to put a few thousand miles on the car before writing the review. The car runs like a dream and the 4 cyl turbo is all the engine great around town and on the highway. The interior is a key component of any car I purchase and I have to say I absolutely love the interior. It rivals the interior of any Audi. The exterior is beautiful and turns heads everywhere. I bought the shadow blue with the two tone interior and its a real pleasure to have in my driveway. I regularly drive 200 miles between NY and Pennsylvania and can only say the car is rock solid at speed (autobahn like). Around town smooth and responsive. Previously owned 2004 Acura TL. Buy it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfy seats on long drives, clean dash, technology package, and surprisingly for a german car, the Navigation is decent. Much better than my wifes 2008 A4. No complaints, the car is a ten.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I cannot give this car a fully neutral review, because I have a design problem that ruins the ownership experience for me. After any significant rain fall, the doors fill up with water that does not drain out until the doors are opened. The problem is particularly bad in the rear doors. A full day after a rainfall, if you open a rear door for the first time, water will gush out on your feet. My local dealer knows of no known fix for this problem and I have read of this problem elsewhere on the net. When winter comes this water will become ice. This problem is too big to ignore or tolerate. Caution !</TEXT>

<TEXT>Amazing car. The performance/luxury/value equation on the CC Sport (or Luxury) is very high. The amount of style (beautiful inside and out), performance (sub 7 sec 0-60 with the manual), fuel economy (30+ on the hwy and 24ish around town), and standard features puts this car in a class by itself. It really stands out on the road in a sea of forgetable family sedans. The get up and go has really surprised me; you find yourself over the posted speed limit in no time and the power delivery is so smooth, you would never know this is a 4 banger. Build quality is top notch and even the standard radio is solid. The one down side...the steering is a little too light. Otherwise, well done VW!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Came off of lease on a Lexus RX-350 and was looking for something less expensive with better mileage. Was seriously looking at the Passat wagon when I caught sight of the CC, sat in it, and ultimately test drove it. That was it...sold! I have owned other German luxury sedans... Audi, BMW, and currently a Mercedes E350 (our other vehicle). From an engineering and design standpoint, the CC is a home run for VW and the best value in the industry. Remarkable acceleration from the 2.0L turbo 4, great handling, beautiful design inside & out. If they could have made the sunroof retractable, this car would be near perfect.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an absolutely outstanding vehicle in all respects. Having owned every major luxury brand - Posche, Mercedes, BMW, Acura, Lexus, etc., this might be the most enjoyable car I have ever owned. It is aesthetically nearly perfect in design, pulling .93 lateral G's, it corners like it is on rails, has a beautiful engine with great sound and flawless transmission and ergonomics only the Germans can design. This is an incredibly well balanced car in all respects. In addition it receives the highest ratings by the IIHS in frontal, side and rear collisions and is one of their "all star" picks.

<TEXT>drives great. The AWD car has wonderful road feel. The car is comfortable. Its unique, you do not see yourself coming and going. Only negative is the roof line, i.e.,rear seat passengers need to be reminded of roof line so they do not hit their head getting in and out of car, front seat needs to be as low as possible to make it easier for anyone over 5" 8" to get in and out as well. Once in, very, very comfortable all around. Only other real negative for me is that phone book does not download to bluetooth system. Overall, this is unlike any VW I have ever been in (Other then perhaps the Phaeton). I would prefer a dealer network more like Audi, BMW or Audi but like lower $.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my old dapper 2003 Passat V6 4Motion for this bigger, wilder animal. V6 is extraordinarily responsive and gets better mileage than I feared-- about 30 on the highway, maybe 15 in town, a few mpg better than my old Passat. Although steering gives less feedback, as others have said, it corners precisely and enthusiastically while the wide, low tires grip tenaciously. Slaloming at high speed on twists and around corners at night, watching pivoting headlights track is a sublimely James Bond movie experience. No defects after 3-plus weeks. Ride is a little busy, but comfortable seats absorb little bumps well. Much appreciated front legroom, good GPS.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Almost unique beauty inside and out and more aggressive stance than Mercedes CLS, warp engine, tires, room, comfort, supercool backup camera displaying gridlines where steering will put you, supercool Tucker-mobile pivoting headlights, roomy trunk with folding backseats (finally!). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only had this car in my garage for a few days - I too think the styling, performance (for a turbo 4 cyl.) and overall level of quality is great for a vehicle at this price level. I am very pleased so far and will update this review in a few months. However, for $32K+ the owner's manual leaves a lot to be desired - what's written and what I've got don't always seem to be the same. No information on the stereo/radio/sat/CD is provided and that's a bit of a frustration. Apparently there's no Blutooth cell system that uses the MFD or at least that my dealer was aware of. The panoramic sunroof is a waste of material. I still think this a great car even with a few shortcomings.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you're in the market for a sleek, classy & sporty sedan without the high $30K price tag - this is undeniably the only choice. A comparably equipped Altima, Accord or Camry costs more, yet this car easily matches the A4, 3 Series and IS in quality and style. I pulled up to my bank the day after I bought this and this gal pulled in beside me in her new 3 series. Her buyer's remorse gaze at my new ride as was unmistakable. This car wants for nothing in style or performance. If I wanted a monster fast sports performer, I'd buy a GTR. This car has everything and then some - all for $10K less than the usual suspects. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My third VW, I've gone from Jetta to Passat and now to CC. In the transitions I was a bit disappointed in the Passat (like most 90's VWs, it had its electrical problems). The CC restores my faith in VW. My wife is a BMW gal and she loves this car. The ride (in stop-and-go, on country roads or highway) is a lot tighter than her 535. The standard features are incredible (could use a better sunroof though) for a car in this price range and the tires and rims that come standard need absolutely no upgrade. Within the first two months every single person who rides with me in this car or even sees the car in a parking lot asks about it. I would definitely recommend this, just negotiate a good price</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Appearance including the Chassis, rims, two-tone "leathertte" (good enough for me) and bucket seats. Std Features: heated seats, computer programmed controls, Sat radio and 6 CD changer, great MFD and steering wheel controls. By far the best is the road handling.

<TEXT>I bought this thinking it would be a good compromise to the $76,000 CLS price. Was I sadly mistaken. Dont get me wrong - it is a very fun car to drive around town but not very stable on the interstate. If you are in the market for a standard sedan , this is a great car to consider. However, if you are used to the BMW and Mercedes quality, don't be fooled by the flashy appearance. It still does not match their quality in detail. For the price of the fully loaded VR6, you could easily get into a nicely equipped BMW or Mercedes and be much more satisfied. I have traded my CC for a 2007 CLS and have no regrets on the decision. Only consider this if the 2.0 option is your choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After five months of ownership, this 11th VW in my driveway has not disappointed me in any way. Fuel economy combined after nearly 7000 miles is 31.1 mpg. Quality/workmanship is excellent, comfort for driver and passengers (front and rear) excellent. Easy to expand the trunk space (although not a wagon....). The 2.0T engine is not only great with respect to fuel economy, acceleration is fabulous, engine noise minimal. Better than the V6 that I've owned. 6-speed manual is smooth and makes driving fun. Sound system is very good. Only (slight) negatives (that one knows after a test drive): View to the rear is challenging at times, and limited seating capacity may be an issue to some</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Unfortunately, the manual comes in the very basic trim. However, rain-sensing wipers, automatic headlights, self-dimming rearview mirror, etc. add to driving experience. Easy to rig iPhone to (satellite) radio (my first one - wish I had installed one before(, making it a handsfree setup. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This exceptional styled sedan meets most acceptance points of any auto out there today, as a previous owner of a DTS [FULLY LOADED] cadillac I miss the softer ride only, however the CC has all if not more extras than the Caddy. Thats the good news folks...the not-so-good points are a User Manual that is NOT so "user friendly" (many smaller titled booklets in one binder) that you are constantly fumbling from one to another to find the info needed, & most [if not all] the driving control feature set-ups have to be programmed...a real nightmare! I use a computer every day and can only imagine someone that don't have some computer skills saddly will end up not using many features available.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a recent college grad. who just started his first real job, and needed a new car. My old car was on its last leg, so I started test driving everything (Camry, Avalon, G35, Mazda6, Altima, A4). I was all set to lease an Altima, but the CC was my last car to look at, and it blew me away in person! In my opinion, it is one of the top 3 or so best looking cars, regardless of price. I have already had 5 different strangers come up to me and ask what kind of car it was (nice ego boost by the way). It's a blast to drive, and nice to have a "worry free" warranty that lasts for the life of the lease (3 years, 36K mi.).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Coming from a Ford family is was hard to purchase a car from across the pond but I am glad I did. My last two cars were ZX2s and did a great job getting me though college and graduate school but moving to the CC is a whole new story! This car is just so tight and responsive compared to any Ford I have ever driven including the Mustang. This car is even nicer than my fathers LS and my wife?s MB. Only thing I would do different is get the car in Black and get the Nav. Not sure why some people post that they are getting bad gas mileage? I do a lot of highway driving and average 27-30MPG (probably due to the six speed).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned virtually every model of BMW for the last ten years. Decided to stop feeding my cash to the bavarians to only have them keep pushing my price points up and value down. I purchased a Black on Black CC Sport, Auto, Sirius, the "leatherette" is superb, and at this quality, leather is a waste of money. What a wonderful car. The fit and finish is impeccable,the styling is modern and fresh, the drive is excellent. You do get a little of the front wheel drive pothole suspension behavior, but it doesn't detract. My mileage in the first thousand miles on freeway is 31.5. I purchased the car for $2500 under sticker. Amazing car for the money. VW has a new level of respect from me.Amazing</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2007 Mustang GT/CS for this more "practical car". Quite honestly, I was out with my wife on a nice Saturday and went into the local dealer to look around. Took the CC for a test drive and was sold. I have only put about 100 miles on her due to a major blizzard, but so far, this car far exceeds my expectations. Thanks to the storm, I have managed to read the entire owners manual, twice. The dealer experience was also a joy. No haggling or arguing over my trade. Dealer tossed in spash guards, installed, as part of the deal when I asked for them.</TEXT>

I finally decided something HAD to be wrong. I took the car in for service, and the dealer found it needed a new electronic power steering controller and a new steering rack. The car drives very differently now. The steering is tight and responsive -- no complaints whatsoever. In fairness to VW, I wanted to update my review. I am a very satisfied customer and strongly recommend the CC to anyone and everyone looking for a top quality, fun-to-drive, great looking sedan. </TEXT>

Some of the very first models came with a memory features for the driver seat as well, but mine did not, which was fine. I was able to find the 6 speed in my color and I was hooked! I currently have about 800 miles on it, and it has been a blast to drive! It has excellent pickup, gas mileage and comfort. I feel like I bought a high end luxury car! Test drive it!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a gorgeous car! I was deciding between the CC Luxury and a 09 Audi A4 Premium Plus. The CC was a few thousand less than the Audi, but the cars are actually quite similar. The CC LUX edition has beautiful leather seats, and all the conveniences of an entry level luxury car. Although Bluetooth is optional and runs about $300 dealer installed. The car drives like an A4 with ample power from the 2.0T engine. Handling is superb. This is my 3rd VW in the past 8 years. Also owned and A4 for awhile. This is probably the nicest, most well appointed, and best handling out of all 4 cars. You can get an entry level CC for around $25K+ which is quite a bargain as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I work for an Audi Dealer and find that the CC is superior in quality, especially in the doors. The doors are more solid, the handles inside and out have a nice feeling of strength and have a luxury tactility. The standard features of Auto headlights with coming home and leaving home, rain sensing wipers, self dimming rear view mirrors, bag hook in trunk, and a 6 cd changer on the CC may only be had in an A4 with a $4000 package! The styling is very unique and very seductive and intriguing. The interior is very luxurious and very well thought out. Everything lies in an intuitive spot. The steering feel is better than the 09 A4, and the handling is tighter as well as more compliant.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Autohold and the electronic parking brake is all automatic. I don't have to press the parking button at all to start driving. Sweet! The seats are cushy and supportive.

<TEXT>Having recently moved from Germany, this is my first car in the US. And while I really love the CC -- kudos for the other reviewers who I concur with on all the pros and favorites -- I had to make a hard compromise: In Germany, all VWs have manual transmission by default, automatic being an option. Here, stick shift isn't even an option (except in the Sport trim, which doesn't allow the selection of sunroof, dynaudio or navi options). Yes, we're in the US but I would like to give VW a gentle nudge about heritage! As soon as VW fixes this, I'll replace my current CC! Side note: Why is a headliner called headliner? Maybe because your head touches it if you exceed 6 feet on the back seat :-)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I may never understand what the developers were thinking when they designed this car. Maybe they read my mind?

<TEXT>I have had my CC,Lux, 2 litre for 2 weeks now. It is a blast to drive! The 2 litre engine is plenty powerful, and there is no need for more. Manumatic transmission is fun and quick. The handling is tight and responsive, and it is remarkably quiet on the highway. I am coming from 12 years of Acura RLs. The seats are extremely comfortable and supportive, the back seats are big enough for my two teenage girls. Biggest downside, so far, is that there are large blind spots over the left and right shoulders. Rear seat headrests get in the way of my wife's view out the back. Mileage, so far, has been 27 highway (averaging 80 mph) and 20 around town. Not yet broken in, though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Proud owner of a CC Sport model. Was going to buy an Accord EX-L. Bought CC instead for less money and it is so much more car. Nothing at this price point rivals this car. The car is a dream to drive. Great acceleration at any speed and superb handling. The fit and finish is impressive as well. Such a simple, straight-forward dash design. Everyone asks what kind of car it is. No one can believe it is a VW. I set out to buy a practical family sedan (2 kids) and bought a thrilling sport sedan/coupe instead.

<TEXT>I am having a love/hate relationship with my CC. The interior and exterior styling are dramatic and pleasing. I have never gotten more "thumbs up" and favorable parking lot comments. The build quality is first-rate. The turbocharged four delivers great performance with truly amazing fuel economy. The value for the money is absolutely out of this world -- nobody sells more car than this for the $27,000 I paid. The dealer experience could not be better. But I am being driven to distraction by the artificial, electronic power steering, which alternates between totally numb and far too much resistance. </TEXT>

Interior is nicely designed with controls adequately placed at driver's reach. It?s roomy for the driver and passenger with a lot of extra trunk space. The passenger seats might be a tight fit for someone 6 feet tall. Overall great job to the designers of this fun, yet sleek looking VW CC.</TEXT>

VW is known for its obsessive fan base and the VW-esque type of handling you experience when driving one. This car blew me away at the dealership and I signed that very day. People are getting whiplash when passing them by in this car. The only way I can describe it is that it looks sooooooooooooo much better in person...actually appears to have a cape or cloak of some sort like batman. Ridiculous handling and power. Kudos VW....customer for life. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought the 09' CC. Drove BMW,Mercedes and Audi. Have owned BMW and Audi - But no more! This is an amazing car! The build quality exudes German pride! The interior is phenomenal - the design is unlike anything else we looked at (at any price) and it fits like a glove! The 2.0 turbo is amazingly powerful and smooth... Did not feel it was necessary to go to the VR6... The list of standard features is impressive! The C-Class MBZ doesn't even offer heated seats standard... If you are even considering a MBZ, BMW or Audi - You MUST drive this car! No regrets!!!! Even the buying experience was nice - good job VW!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior - really NICE! Power - 2.0 Turbo is fast and smooth - Sport mode transmission! Airbags EVERYWHERE!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just found this car when I was about to turn in my 530xi, and by every measure, it is MUCH more refined and luxurious than that car, at about 35% less cost. Styling inside and out is superb, and just about every time I get out of the car someone is asking what it is -- no one can believe it is a VW. Absolutely stellar for the price, or even several thousand more. Anyone considering any of the German/Japan luxury marks should take a look at this, you will be utterly amazed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior detail and quality are second to no car I have ever owned (BMW, Audi, Jag, Land Rover). Best central computer and simple controls on the market. As fun/quick as BMW, Audi, and all-wheel drive crushes the 530xi. Unlike Benz or BMW, 90% of the features you would want are standard.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking to buy a new car and liked the Nissian Maxima, However i decided to shop around and look around. While online i came across the Volkswagen site and saw the new CC. The Car looked great on the web. I decided to take a look in person and WOW the car looked better up close. I was sold, the only thing left was to test drive it. The dealer was closed so i came back the next day and the test drive was perfect i could not believe the power this car has. I called me wife and told her this car is bought. The dealer added the Nav system and that put it over the top. I get nothing but compliments about the car and you don't see this car at every stop light, like some cars.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Design looks like the Mercedes CLS, the two tone seats are a must. The 4cyl Turbo feels like a V6 without the Gas consumption. Most of all great price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I ended up trading my 03 Passat GLX, which I loved, yesterday due to original transaction problems. Still in awe that this gorgeous car was so affordable. I have always been a automatic/sunroof kind of girl but the manual/no roof is perfect! Do not even miss the sunroof as the roof line is lower than traditional sedans, it feels like you are in a cockpit! Love, love this car!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had just purchased a 08' Passat when I found out about the CC. The pictures do not do it justice. I was having my sons Rabbit serviced when the first CC's arrived. I just had to have one ended up trading in my wife's 06'Bug and gave her the 08'Passat. VW hit this one out of the Ball Park! Most people confuse it for the CLS the looks I get are just like when the new Beetle came out. Do yourself a favor and test drive one you won't be disappointed</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything - Although it the first year out - I have tried to find fault-Their is honestly nothing I have found to be wrong about the CC - Except now I'm going to have to trade in the 08'Passat for a CC for my wife she likes the White Gold - This is German Engineering at its finest</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I went to the following dealerships in search of a new vehicle: Lexus (E300), Mercedes Benz (C Class), Volvo (S40/60) and Acura (TL/TSX). While at the Acura dealership, I turned and saw the CC. Test drove it that day and bought it the next. The interior/ exterior styling made it unique. The others cars may have more power, but the CC made up for it in price. I've owned a Jetta, the New Beetle and now the CC for about a month. This car will definitely make buyers consider VW. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the sport trim w/ Bluetooth+Sirius radio. I traded in an '01 Audi A4. The car is overall superb. The car rivals the BMW/A4 models in the 30-40k class even in the sport model. Outside: The car looks better in person. The aesthetics are more in-line with a Lexus IS250 as opposed to a VW. Inside: Regardless of what trim you select the car comes with numerous amenities normally expected ala carte. Pay close attention to the standard list. The 2.0L turbo 4 cyl engine is deceptively powerful in tandem with the transmission. Even the non-leather V-tex seating has a leather feel to it. Leather wrapped steering wheel, power adjustable heated seats, climate control...</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Standard amenities expected in a luxury vehicle. 2.0L 4 cylinder turbo is surprisingly powerful - I had my doubts until the test drive. Back seat is expansive - this is a sporty family sedan w/ sophisticated looks. A married man's dream. On-screen compass, temperature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a 98 Passat w/ manual transmission. Having owned it for 10 yrs, you can imagine how much I enjoyed the drive. The 09 Passat CC is amazing. It looks great and brings a smile to your face while driving it. It has the solid VW build and all the German engineering that you would expect. The tiptronic transmission w/ "S" gear is fun but not quite as exhilarating as a true manual experience. But, wow, what a car. I bought the true Sport version without any added options offered on the Luxury version. It really has everything you need for a nice ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking to buy a Dodge. Went to the dealer who was a Dodge / VW dealership only to find they closed the Dodge dealer. While there I took a look at the Passat. Nice car until the dealer showed me the CC. I was sold before I had the car out of the driveway on my test drive. This is a solid car, lots of power, comfortable and one of the nicest cars on the road. I have been told it looks like a Mercedes, Volvo and Audi. People are amazed its a VW. This car is sweeeet and a blast to drive. How come I never knew about this car before? I am glad i looked in the VW dealership. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought this car yesterday, so this is really first impression review. I was looking to purchase "performance" car during last month and so. Checked few options such as BMW 328/330, G35, Civic hatchback.... finally I was standing to buy G35, but then VW CC arrived and I responsible buyer I went to check cheaper option ~36k of G35 vs. ~31k of VW CC. What I found is that although front wheel drive CC sticks to the road just like a shaving gum on my window. Even bad quality of Californian roads hasn't changed feeling of amazing sport style driving. The sounds weak 200hp engine actually deliver superior momentum of 200+ available since 1700rpm. So feeling is almost like 360hp G35.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am so glad I took the time to compare. I've been an Infinity owner for the past 6 years but decided to test drive the VW CC bfore my next purchase; and "Thank God" I did. I've only had my new CC for 2 months but I feel like it's a test drive each morning just going to work. I love my VW and the solid feel it gives me. I just feel safer and sportier in it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the 4-motion. I live near the mountains and this car gives me the ability to drive on snow, water, or ice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Lease was up on my 2006 VW Passat; been waiting for the CC but test drove everything under the sun in the meantime. The CC is everything I'd hoped it would be: exterior build and interior fit are exemplary. The car is fast and for the most part rides smooth (the run-flat tires make the ride a tad rougher). The navigation and satellite radio are a definite upgrade from my 06 Passat's navi. My mom and I were sitting in the car last night watching Indiana Jones on DVD; the sound was amazing and I don't even have Dynaudio. VW got this one right.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navi, 30 gb hard drive, ipod adapter, park assist, feel of the seats, panorama roof. The carefree maintenance package available on all 2009s, is on par with BMW and Volvo's complimentary maintenance.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've been a VW driver for many years and when the CC came along it was love at first sight. I bought the Sport/MT which is the base trim level. I can't believe all the standard features that it comes with, all for under $28,000. All my friends are green with envy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Sport seats are incredible! They just snuggle you in and provide you with great support. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Passat 06 up for lease; just bought the CC last night (11.12.8). While waiting for the CC to come out, I test drove everything under the sun (AccordCamAltSaturnBMWMerc)for the past year, and I still came back to the CC. It's fun to drive, and is easily the most stylish of all the Passats. Excellent interior fit and finish. Like one of the other reviewers stated, it's not for everyone but if you're looking for something different from the standard Passat or some of the other sedans out there, it's a great value. And yes, it does resemble the Mercedes CLS. There I've said it. Just bought it, so I'll check back with another review when I've had it for awhile.</TEXT>
