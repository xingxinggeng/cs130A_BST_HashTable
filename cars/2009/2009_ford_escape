<TEXT>Bought the Escape as a daily driver. The AWD was a must for the winters here. Very practical for my wife and I and our 5yr old daughter. Seats are comfortable. The revised V6 is great. Runs strong. Gas mileage hovers in the 23.5 range with 70%/30% mix of rural 2 lane highway/city driving every week. Very nimble to drive. Was plenty comfoirtable for us on a 600 mile trip to the beach.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V6 engine, SYNC, cargo area roomy for size of vehicle. Somewhat truck-like styling is way cooler than competitors which look like small station wagons on steroids!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After a 4-year break from having a SUV (Had an '01 Explorer Sport), I am so happy to have purchased this vehicle. The size is perfect - not too big so parking is a breeze (plus the reverse sensor helps), but big enough to haul my bicycles and dog in the back. On a 1200 mile roundtrip of mostly highway driving, I averaged 26 mph, which I confirmed against my gas consumption and the miles driven. The sync system is like none other as is the navigation. It's a very addictive machine - great job Ford!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first Ford vehicle I buy and I am very disappointed with the build quality. First 2 weeks and there is already a welding spot inside the left rear end that <cracked> causing a constant ratlle sound upon departure. The dealer fixed it but it left me with a very sour taste about Ford quality. Especially because I had driven only in city roads and not off-road. Now I noticed the <hoot> sound that many forums people have experienced. I really wonder what is next...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have problem after problem with the SUV. Really thinking about public transportation. Clicking in the wheels, shifting is horrible, transmission seal leaked and this is in the first 3 months of me own the vehicle. The good reviews must be from the dealerships. Think and research before you make this purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It's not exactly what I wanted, but the more I drive it the more I think it's what I need. I wanted a Ford Edge but the price wasn't right. So I test drove the Escape and looked at the mpg rating and figured it might be what I need. It's fun to drive, almost like a car. It's real nimble. The acceleration isn't that great but once the 6 speed auto transmission gets you up to 40 mph, it takes off. But the main thing for me is the fuel economy. My last truck was a gas guzzler, so it's nice to not have to pay frequent visits to the gas station. The true test will be seeing how it deals with Chicago winters. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very surprised with the performance and ride of this little SUV. I wanted something that would get better gas mileage than my full size pickup for every day driving and I am very please with this little gem. The average gas mileage has been better than projected and it is fun to drive. The SYNC system is a fantastic added bonus. My only negative is I'm not a fan of the cloth seats. Wish I would have gotten the leather interior. The front seat room is great. The back seat is best left for little people if the front seat driver is taller. The cargo room is surprisingly large. If I could offer one improvement to Ford it would be to move the back seat back and add some leg room.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first Ford was a 2004 Ford Focus ZX3, and I loved it! I wanted to go in and get the Focus Zx4 with leather seats and Microsoft-sync technology-but alas no hatchbacks.I am outdoorsy with a big dog,and a consummate environmentalist, so an SUV never seemed like something I would let myself have. However this SUV gets nearly 30 miles to the gallon (less with the kayaks on top) but with all the room and the good gas mileage I gave it whirl. It was fun. As soon as I got used to the narrow wheel base --it was a lot of fun! I love it, I love it, I love It. Its comfy, practical safe, and economic! not the sexiest car terms but works for me, my dog, my kayak, my ski's, & all my gear.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first suv and the only difference i noticed from driving the car was I sat taller and the passing power in the truck felt a little slower. Other than that I love this vehicle. The handle and braking is great, the ride and turns are smooth, the gas tank and mileage are the same and my previous car, and the look is so versatile that I feel so feminine just being next to it, yet when I see a man in it, the look it totally masculine. The only thing I wish my car had is the new "Ford" front grill.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The voice activated navigation. I'm always running late for everything and it's great to get directions while you are on the go. I have not even tried to program any directions yet. The sync phone system is very nice too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well after i got my license, my parents decided to buy me a car. We looked at Chevy and Ford, and since i wanted an SUV but didn't want to pay $90 at the pump like my dad's old 07 jeep commander (now has an '09 maxima) we decided on the Escape. My Mom wanted great Safety scores, which the Escape has, so there's another plus. I enjoy driving this car, the power steering and the ease of controlling the wheel is a joy. The car just feels good and solid throughout. I am very satisfied with my first car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I basically forced my parents to throw in the Moon and Tune package, and i love Sync and my sunroof. Sync is reliable most of the time for me and the remote start is also very convenient. Back to Sync, I highly advise to get sync with any Ford, one of the best things about the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 6 months of research and numerous test drives, it was love at first drive. Handles extremely well with great visibility and surprising power from the 240hp 3 liter. The 6 speed transmission took a little getting used to with near seamless shifting. We've experienced around 20mpg in town and 27mpg on the highway. Nicely laid out with leather interior and chrome accents, ambient floor lighting and the Sync system which in my opinion, is a must for anyone who owns a cell phone. I have not doubt that "the boss" will be enjoying her SUV for a very long time!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Escape (we named her Carly) for about 6 mo. and I am very happy. I love to drive it. I have the Sun n' Sync package and I love having a sun roof, sirrus radio/cd/am/fm/aux jack. I also like the USB port. I avg. 26 mpg mixed city/hwy driving which is pretty good for a V6 SUV. I like the sporty look and feel as well. Very comfortable to drive, all ready took it on a 1200 mi roundtrip vacation with my husband and 2 kids. Very roomy and comfy. I added heated seats and remote start for cold WI winters. The seats fold down and is great for 2 black labs - wish the back windows opened for venting. The dogs would like that too! All around I am very happy!! Love my Escape!</TEXT>

<TEXT>In June I purchased a 2009 Escape XLT AWD with the 4cyl engine. I have been waiting to write a review until I had driven it for a while. I live in the Boston area. I have taken my Escape on vacations to Cape Cod and to Acadia National Park in Maine. Commuting to work I average 24mpg, while on the highway I get 28mpg. I love my Escape except for one thing. The 4cyl engine is too noisy for me, especially when accelerating. Once up to cruising speed, the Escape is remarkably quiet. Also, while peppy, the 4cyl really struggled climbing the hills of Maine, especially with the AC on. If I could go back and buy my Escape again, I would get the 6cyl FWD which has the same combined mpg as 4cyl AWD.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Thought I'd wait a few months before reviewing. I do like the Escape but it does have flaws. Tan interior dash looks great but causes so much glare your eyes get tired on a lengthy trip. Should have black upper part like most autos. Also glare on tach/speedometer plastic at certain times of day. Seats are fairly comfortable even though there is no lumbar support offered. Surprised about that. Transmission gives off a hoot or whoot everytime you start off. Common problem on forums. There is a vibration somewhere in the dash directly in front of the driver. It cannot be located and on many occasions drives me nuts. Wish I had done more research on the Ford Escape forums before buying.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Peppy. Large windows and windshield for great visibility. Good gas mileage. Gets approx. 25 plus mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had the car for 3 weeks now and nothing to concerning. As most people I did all the research I could. What drew me to this car was its changes from 08-09 all pointing to better gas mileage and better outside design on the front end. I have been very pleased with so far an 24-25MPG City average with 240hp V6-not bad. I with being my first ford the initial quality appears to be impressive, I hope I am saying the same thing 5 years later. My only concern as others have noticed is a good deal of plastic with the interior-but this was not enough of an issue to keep from buying the Escape. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really liked the new front end design, new engine, new transition from the 08 model better MPG. Ford also has intergraded technology very nice into their lineups. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have purchased Chrysler products for years, most recently a 300 C. I'm so glad I switched to Ford. I had a 2009 Flex AWD Limited that I loved, but due to the uncertainty of the economy, I took a proactive approach and "down sized" my ride. I was so impressed with the quality of the Flex, I stayed with Ford and went with the more economical Escape Limited. What a pleasant surprise...I bought it from a dealer that was 75 miles from my home and on the way home it was already averaging 28.5 mpg! The ride and handling are good, the engine is more responsive and the radio is better than I expected. It's not the Flex by any means...but @ $14,000 less it's a great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been in the business for 40 years and just retired. Demo-less for the first time, I bought what I have come to believe (and now know) is the finest small SUV in the marketplace. The fit and finish is second to none. The comfort, ditto. Gas mileage for a powerful v-6 is excellent and if you like squeaks or rattles, buy a CR-V or a Sante Fe, not an Escape. The interior quality makes the Murano look like a Yugo. If you want the best made SUV (based on my 40 years of experience) on the market, buy an Escape. If you can live without the whistles and bells, buy the XL but stay away from the 4 cyl. The domestics still haven't gotten the hang of building a powerful, torquey 4-banger.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2009 Ford Escape is in my opinion one of the best cars Ford has ever produced and represents part of their new commitment to reliability and excellence. The 09 Escape is comfortable, utilitarian and a pleasure to drive. I test drove almost every small to middle SUV on the market. I found myself comparing everything to the Escape. I was quite surprised by this as I come from a family that almost always buys foreign autos. IN all of my test drives the Escape bested every other vehicle in terms of comfort, pragmatism and function. I believe that the 09 is also a vast improvement over the 08. If you are in the market for a SUV I highly recommend this car. Ford earned my business!</TEXT>

<TEXT>All I can say is that the price is right, the look is right, the ride is right and the fuel efficiency is right for this SUV. I also got the entertainment package and moon and tune package along with the standard upgrades on the limited version. Just a great SUV and I highly recommend this to anyone. Not sure why the Editor's have an average rating of 6.9 but the consumers have a 9.1 rating...in this case believe the consumers!</TEXT>

<TEXT>As all new car buyer's, I was looking for safety, quality, manufacture reputation, and price. My wife and I have found almost all of that in our 2009 Escape XLT. It is a good vehicle, very economical, and meets all of our needs, but I wish that it caused a little more excitement. It is just a plain, simple, vehicle. The exterior styling is fine; but the interior reminds me of fish scales, and everything is made from plastic. We chose to upgrade to the leather package, but still feels like you are sitting inside of a children?s toy. We like Fords, and will continue to buy their vehicles in the future, but just feel like Ford slightly, missed the mark with this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well I have had many cars in my 30 yrs this is my 3rd ford and im no where near dissappointed in their cars yet. I love my truck would have given nothing but ten's but i have had a little problems and Im only at 1200 miles. I think i love my truck so much because i bought it BSN (brand spankin' new) so Im very please. After two trips to the service department my truck was diagnosed with a bad instrument panel which caused Candy (Shes red) spedometer and tachometer to go off by themselves just with the turn of the key and rev up as if you were pressing on the gas, all the way up 120 mph!! But she's being fixed right now and because of the excellent warranty I pay nothing :)!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first NEW car in almost 25 years. We have been wanting a small SUV and after a lot of research we decided on the Ford Escape. Besides the comfort, the street appeal and the reliability ratings, this FWD,4 cyl. 6 speed trans. is getting nearly 27 mpg! It's only 4 days old and supposed to have even better mileage when broken in. We live in the Ozarks where it's all mountain driving and the car handles like it was a V6! There's no road noise and the automatic shifting is effortless. The front seats are ample and the Sirius music is awesome! This SUV has a lot of classy features and we know we will be enjoying it for a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchashed this brand new 2009 Ford Escape Limited Edition 4WD about a month ago. I drove this vehicle off the lot with 100 miles and a bad drivers door seal that leaked and you can hear air whisping by. It didnt worry me much because the waranty would cover the repair. It was taken to the shop the next week and I picked it up four days later. The problem was still not fixed. The next day the check engine light came on. I took it back to the shop they said that the fuel cap seal was not working properly. I took it right bck to the dealership and returned it with 500 miles on it.Ford should have put more time into testing this vehicle before letting it out for consumers to purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A week after I drove it off the lot, I noted the steering wheel vibrated quite a bit while idling at red lights. Once it got hot and I started running the A/C, the vibration spread to the entire dash. My passengers could feel it. It was getting worse and the dealer said all the V4's did it, and they wouldn't do anything to fix it. "The car operates in the manner in which it was designed" was what the service reps and all the Ford reps said. Eventually the vibration got so bad that the antenna on the passenger side OUTSIDE the car would vibrate with the inside of the car. Ford said that was normal. I gave up and traded it in for a Mazda.</TEXT>

<TEXT> I have enjoyed driving the Escape, but disappointed in its reliability. A bad wheel bearing was replaced at 3000 miles. A part for the steering wheel shaft was ordered at the same time. The airtime/rollercoaster feeling when driving over 'dips' in country roads was unexpected. Removable cup holders and easy to vacuum interior makes upkeep of the interior simple. Folding down the rear seats is easy, but I have had to search for the seat belts after setting the seats back up. Currently, 26mpg is it's avg highway mileage, I expect to see this increase with the recent repairs. Finally, I keep window cleaner in the suv due to significant drop in visability with any dirt on the windshield. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Ford Escape and I love it. It was a toss up between it and the Mitsu Outlander but ultimately won because of maintenance costs. It handles like a car but doesn't dissapoint in off-road uses. I've taken it in 12" inches of snow out in a field, through at least 18" inches of water on a 4x4 track and it's handled admirably. In fact I've gone farther than some 4x4 pickups. Gas mileage is 29MPG (US) on the highway which is where I do most of my driving. Everyone who's road in it is impressed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SYNC system is awesome, I have a 32GB USB Thumbdrive plugged in with my music. The 'SEX' ambient lights are rad. The front seats are very comfortable. Removable cup holders that can be washed in dish washer. Tons of music imputs. 29MPG</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our 3rd Ford Escape and this is by far the best one yet. The 2009 has a great 4 cylinder engine that has almost the equivalent power of the 2008 V6, with much better fuel consumption (or should I say conservation). We average 24 mpg with mostly city driving, and almost 30 mpg on our last all-highway road trip! It does great in the snow and handles the bumpy roads and potholes with ease. The 4 cyl. doesn't have the fastest acceleration but the mpg more than makes up for that shortcoming (and is to be expected). Nice amount of storage space and cup holders, plenty of room for all your stuff. SYNC is awesome - just plug in your iPod/mp3 player and use your voice to control it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The SYNC technology is the coolest on any vehicle (voice-activated stereo controls as well as cell phone controls). Ambient lighting (different colors throughout the vehicle) is fun. Huge center compartment (removable inserts) - could probably fit a large purse/bag in there.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just moved to an area where I need AWD for winter driving. Previously drove a Ford Focus (and loved it) but did some shopping of other AWD vehicles other than Ford. Still ended up coming back to the Ford and no regrets! Escape handles nicely on gravel and steep inclines. No problems with braking. Interior is laid out nicely - love the Sync! MPG is that of a SUV, it's to be expected. Very quiet ride compared to other Fords I have owned. Nice options on the XLT that you would expect to pay Limited price for. Really fun to drive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted to buy American. Unfortunately I think I picked the wrong manufacturer for a small SUV. The build quality is horrible. The shut lines on the doors are way to big and inconsistent. I can fit my finger in the one at the top of the back hatch. The rear folding seat design is horrible. The interior is cheap and plastic abundant. The rear window sounds like it is going to fall out. The rear suspension booms over anything but the smallest bumps. The doors don't shut fully unless you slam them. I could go on and on. I can't deny the fact that it gets good gas mileage for an SUV. "Drive Quality" clearly does not apply to the Escape. Maybe I'll let the bank repo it since their is no resale </TEXT>

Good performance and gas mileage combination with the modern 171 horsepower engine and manual transmission. Has an excellent ride and comfortable seats. Nice on the highway and a good handling city car, too. Fun to drive and fun to sit up high. Safer than earlier models. I have the red metallic. Looks great with legal color tinted windows side and rear. Lots of cargo room with the seats down. Has the updates of a Suv from Japan and feels just as good with a lower price. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2003 Ford Escape XLT for a 2009 model. I got a great deal and 0.0% financing. I opted for the 4-cylinder (to feel a bit "greener" and get better gas mileage). I was very hesitant about this, coming from the V6 2003. But, to my great surprise this is a very peppy SUV and I honestly only notice a difference going up steep hills. I love the SYNC option (an option I actually could have cared less about when buying this--but--it works flawlessly with my iPod) and the updates to this are great. I really like how the back seats fold flat now and the fact that you can open the back gate with your key. I LOVE the 2009 Escape!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>So I did A LOT of shopping - a lot.

I Love it - great gas milage (@ 26 average) huge fan of the console and the sync technology. Drives very well for a 4 cyl. after coming from a V6 its actually great. My decision had a lot to deal with how I felt in the car rather than what everyone else said - go with your gut!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this in April of '09 and waited to write this review, because I wanted to see if my delight in this car would hold--it has. So far, I've gotten 26 mpg's but it's still adjusting. I saw where Edmunds said getting the rear seat down was difficult -not so- lift a handle and down it folds. I'm loving the Siris radio that comes free for 6 months. I will subscribe when it runs out. The fit of the car is great. My husband loves it too. I bought this car because when I researched cars on Edmnds, the people who had bought this car gave it such high marks. They were right. No complaints at all. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love all the technology located on the steering wheel. I'm not a techy but I'm learning to love it. I love my bluetooth phone-quick note- if you buy this car and your blue tooth doesn't work- it's the phone. Mine was defective so I got a new phone and it worked. To me blue-tooth is magic! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted a truck from another manufacture, but due to cost and gas prices we focused on small SUVs. I'd driven an F150 before and loved it, so we looked at the Escape. The one negative was KBB's prediction about resale value (but I keep cars a long time so not a big deal). I was impressed by the safety ratings (my number one priority), and liked the safety features available. The SYNC system is great, it?s easy to see all the way around the vehicle (no blind spots and easy to back up). At 60 mph I get 31 mpg, at 80 mph 25mpg; not bad for an SUV. It's well designed and wonderful to drive (I enjoy my commute now!). A great vehicle and a good value (we got it below invoice). I love my Escape!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The SYNC system, exterior styling, interior design ( everything is laid out very well and the center console is great for organizing), peppy response (plenty of get up and go) good mpg for an SUV, comfortable, fun to drive, very smooth ride, great handling, USB port, best of all the safety features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking to buy an SUV that gets good gas mileage. I bought a new 2009 Ford Escape and absoluetly love it. It gets great gas mileage, very smooth ride, easy to drive, and great features. I was also able to get a really great deal on the price. With only about 2000 miles on the SUV i am already getting close to 26 mpg. i am also only about 5' tall so i thought it was great that the seats raised up and forward. They allowed for me to see great and have no blind spots. The handling in the escape is amazing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a 2005 AWD Limited and turned 100,000 miles on it. New car deals are so good now that we traded it in for the 2009, and the new version is so much better! Better looking, smoother driving, and the perks are all very cool. Have a hard time understanding how Edmunds calls this SUV "adequate" but owners have rated it much closer to the truth. Went to FWD and 4 cyl this time and getting 27 mpg on the road. We have a 6 year old black lab so we get the dark interior and we love the way the rear seats fold flush to the back of the front seats - Max loves to lay with his head on the headrest between us so many other fold-down rear seats just didn't work for us. The best little SUV made! </TEXT>

<TEXT>My family spent about a month and a half trying to find the best vehicle to accomodate our needs and I believe we made a great choice. We needed something with more room for a family but also a vehicle that sipped gas. We knew with an SUV that we would have to sacrifice mileage. I figured it would average 24 mpg but I have been pleasantly suprised. After 3800 miles I have consistently improved mileage each tank, going from 26.7 up to 29.13. For a non-hybrid SUV, I consider this excellent. -Smooth shifting transmission, quiet engine, great cargo space (boxy design helps), good visibility, center console is HUGE, smooth ride, great leg room. For a base XLS with AUTO and SYNC, nice features.</TEXT>

I sometimes kick the brake release lever when I am looking to press down the emergency brake pedal, and I wish you could pop the rear hatch from inside the vehicle, and yes, folding down the rear seats is a piece of work, but other than those quibbles it is a love affair.

<TEXT>Have had it for a week now. So far it has exceeded expectations in some areas. After much research I found you really get alot for your money with the Escape. It rides good, has a very tough exterior look, and is loaded with features. Got the XLT w/ Sync, tow pkg and cargo pkg. I would not recommend the charcoal interior, carpet shows every little particle of dirt you have on your shoes. The Sync system is the most outstanding feature to be put in a car since air- conditioning. If you love your IPOD, spend the x-tra money for it, you won't regret it. MPG is 23-24 overall, 27-28 on interstate. That is hard to beat for a v-6 SUV that has lots of pep! Roomy interior for your family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our Escape after evaluating seven other manufacturers/models in the same compact SUV class. It has been a great car, averaging 27 mpg. Runs like a top on cross-country trips, and easy to park in the city. Snow driving has been even and controlled for a vehicle of this small size and weight. Brakes and steering are very responsive. We purchased this car on the internet, MSRP 27300, but cost to us was only 22000. Best bang for the bucks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2009 Ford Escape is an outstanding value. The interior is spacious and well thought out, and the seats are comfortable. The buttons on the center console are pretty crowded. It's a good thing Sync is such a powerful tool, because navigating some of the audio menus during driving could be dangerously distracting. The V6 feels powerful and has great get up and go. Fuel economy is just as advertised at this point. In traffic-clogged downtown Madison, WI I'm getting 19 mpg. It's much more efficient on the highway however, as it edges towards the advertised 26 mpg. Sunroof is a particularly great addition in this car. Really opens up the car. Light interior also makes the car open up "bigger"</TEXT>

<TEXT>We used to buy Fords in the 80's and 90's but went away due to poor quality after 2000. Due to incentives and promises of quality from Ford, we decided to take a look again. We are very glad we did. We love our Escape and feel like we have one-upped everyone else since we found a jewel that most people overlook. We got 0% finance for 60mo, $500 rebate for college student, $1K below invoice, full retail for trade, and full 6/60 warranty + maintenance (oil changes) for only $1800.

<TEXT>Not a bad vehicle for what it is. Not perfect though. Some nice improvements over the 08's with the extra HP, new transmission, and other minor tweaks. Getting about 23mpg mixed driving (30city/70highway mix). Nice looking inside and out for what it is. Still a lot of cheapness though with some of the plastics used. Even with the 240hp v6, still not impressed with everyday driving power. Still feels like an overburdened 4cyl unless you really get on it. Transmission has trouble finding the right gear a lot of times, particularly at lower speeds. Has the potential to be very quiet but excessive wind noise comes noticeably from side windows and rear hatch. This isnt a lexus after all though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched all the mid suv's and narrowed it down to the Hoda Crv and Escape. I actually made up my mind on the Crv. I drove quite a few of them and gave Ford another look. The Escape drives a lot smother, the Crv was bumpy, had less leg room, noisey 4 cylinder, and the styling was sort of ugly. My Escape is loaded, the stereo is 320 wts. Leather is very comfortable, steering great, ride quiet, got the 17" wheels, so handling is sports car like, shifts very smooth, so far I love the Escape. I hope it's as reliable as the Honda. Every time I pass a Crv I say to myself, glad I didn't buy one. Get the locking lugs for the expensive mags and cargo mat. I got the 4 cyl. for mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I tried several small SUVs and decided that the Escape was the best for me. Others had visability issus, headrest issues and even the ease of getting into the back seat. I travel from Santa Cruz to Lake Tahoe and have grandkids with me. I don't get the gas mileage that they say (26 highway) as I am only getting 22.7 at best and I am not a speed demon. Even driving alone I don't get the gas milage. So I may trade in sooner than I ever planned for another Escape. Others seem to be getting the better gas milage. I would also like to see the front seats maybe an inch or so longer in lengh. I am only 5'1 but it seems short even to me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got a great deal, has all options and it cost me 28k, 5k less than expected. The navigation system and sync work very well, and if you get bored you can do voice recognition training so your car understands you better, though it's not neccessary. The ambient lights have several colors and are a nice touch. Suprisingly the performance is close to my 07 Fusion with the same engine. My only complaints are that the rear seats don't fold completely flat, and that the front seats are a little tough on the lower back, but then again I haven't really looked for the lumbar adjustment.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We love this vehicle. We purchased this vehicle because of the great deals and the need for a dependable winter tranport. We previously had a 2001 Tribute(an Escape twin)which we loved. The new Escape is noticably improved. The 6-speed automatic is smooth and accelerates nicely. The fuel economy is beyond my expectations (26 on the highway with our V6 AWD). Around suburbia, 21+ is easily feasible depending on how agressive drive. The handling is truck like but this is desired. Great in the snow which is in part why we have it. The lthr is improved & of good quality. This is an excellent option if you want to buy a quality product made in the USA at a good price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2005 Escape and traded it for a new 2009. These are two completely different SUV's. The new Escape seems bigger, heavier, smoother and easier to steer.

As much as I liked the other Escape, I like this one more. This is a fun vehicle to drive and turns heads. (Ditch the heated seats- they barely warm up.) </TEXT>

My daughter had outgrown her booster seat and the upgraded safety features such as rear shoulder strap on the center back seatbelt, side airbags, and the sensor that turns the front passenger airbag off if the passenger doesn't weigh enough on this model that were not on the 02 make it safer for her now that she doesn't have a carseat.

The stability control system works as described. The Sync system is just wonderful and fun, kudos to Microsoft and Ford, it works flawlessly. It seems bigger, 450 pounds bigger and roomier, has 20 percent more horsepower, yet I'm getting about 20 percent better gas mileage.

<TEXT>I had just gotten my new Escape XLT a few weeks ago. Let me start by saying it's a sharp looking small SUV. I stayed away from the all wheel drive after hearing a lot of problems people were having with them. Well the 6cyl. Ft. wheel drive is great. The one issue is the transmission. The new 6 speed is nice but the gears settings are rough. The 1st. gear drags out and shifting could be smoother. For a 240hp V6 the power is there it just takes a bit to get it out. The sync is great, power windows, door locks, one touch moon roof, keyless touch pad, etc. All very nice. Overall a great SUV for the class & the price. </TEXT>

I have to admit that the 2.5L has just as much pep as the V6 did in the 2004. The fit and finish is night and day between the two. I looked at all of the competitors and found this one to be much better in style, interior comfort and fuel economy. I read all of the reviews and did not understand why a lot of reviews claim poor quality and outdated design. Have you looked at the RAV4 lately. Interior and exterior are so ugly.

<TEXT>After driving a klunker for years, I was really looking forward to my brand new Escape. Unfortunately, thanks to the capless fuel system, my SES light has remained on most of the time I've owned the vehicle. Debris gets into the system (imagine that!), which causes the light to come on. I've taken it to a dealer twice. It comes back on a few days later. New vehicles are not supposed to have problems! It's been a disappointment for me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync system and sound system in general; heated seats; good quality leather; reverse sensor.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I set up an appointment to test drive a few models at my dealership. The night before as well as during the drive, it snowed, it sleeted and it froze. The Escape handeled as if it was high and dry. The I4 engine was comparable to a Six .The 4wd wouid not let me skid. All the toys are fun. I can not wait to go long distance. Even to my mother in law's. I will write again to update.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love everything about this vehicle except the material they used for the seat covers looks very cheap. (so I will be getting some seat covers). Other than that is is wonderful.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sync is my favorite feature (though if you go a few days and haven't synced your phone you then have to resync it).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love it, but my wife has an issue with the seat head rests, front and back. I agree, the back one, way too far back to be of any issue in an accident or sleeping. Front, she thinks is to forward. I like it, but it's about personal confort. It's the only issue, other than that, love to drive it. Don't know if the leather package has better head rest.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got a great deal then had them add running boards before I would sign. This is a very nice auto. The sage exterior and camel interior are excelent. Has every option but GPS and trailer hitch. Wife had to have heated seats, she is happy. Sirius radio and Sync are a lot of fun. Handles very well and enough power for me. From Ohio and looking forward to 4x4 feature.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Reverse sensor, attention to detail, fantastic interior, excellent ride. Very good sound system, good looking auto, keyless entry.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a great vehicle, totally love it. Just bought it Nov 24th. SYNC is so much fun..a great feature! I also like the power sunroof with shade. Never had Sirius satellite radio before and wiil definitly subscribe once my 6 months runs out. Am very happy with my Escape, would recommend it to anyone. Everywhere I go, people come over and ask me about it. As a big guy, I feel very comfortable in it, very roomy. Ride is smooth and it handles very well. I did get the 4 wheel drive and haven't really tried it out. Living here in Maine, we have some pretty nasty weather, so I am anxious to see how it handles in snow.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SYNC is well worth it. Power sunroof is a nice add on. Sirius radio also is a must have.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As a loyal Honda owner, I never thought I would buy a Ford until I saw and drove the 2009 Escape. Lots of power, quiet smooth ride, lots of room, good gas mileage (if you don't gun it). Sync is awesome as I have my cell phone & iPod running through the stereo system. Not sure how I lived with out it before I bought this truck. Plenty of room! When I took it for a test drive, the salesman was 6'5" and had a lot of leg & head room while in the back seat. The 6 cylinder can tow 3500 pounds. Bet the CRV or RAV4 can't do that. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration, look, space, gas mileage, Sync, and smooth ride. Built in Sirius radio. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As a previous owner of a 02 Escape, I can't believe how far Ford has come with this vehicle. The interior of this vehicle has a nice lay out. Ride is firm but at the same time absorbs the road like a luxury car. Sync system works well. Easy to set up. Very nice feel with the controls. Ford took every effort to make this vehicle quiet,with insulation under the hood,fire wall and wheel well. As for gas mileage, Am getting 23mph over all.The 6 speed transmission is smooth. Ford also put on radial tires with less off road tread for better gas mileage. Outstanding value for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sync. Seat comfort and ride. Well, the whole vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wow, what a find! Normally I do not like Ford products, but this Escape has changed my mind. Beautifully designed and a real kick to drive. Wife and I both just love it totally. Though I am tall, 6'2", I get in and out easily and have plenty of headroom. Totally feel comfortable. Wife totally love it. It will be around for a number of years to come</TEXT>

<TEXT>Like most consumers, I shopped around at competing models. The Escape - I like the looks, gas mileage (averaging 26 hwy and 22 city), and especially the ergo layout of the drivers position. At 6'4" I need to make sure the vehicle fits me, and other brands (Toyota, Honda) just didn't fit me correctly.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Layout, mileage, sync is okay, but can be annoying at times. Aggresive design. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>No hot rod, but plenty of pickup for a 4 cylinder. The ride is slightly firm but very comfortable. Handles much better than the '08 and the interior is very quiet. The 6 speed transmission is very smooth. Getting great mileage already. The Sync and nav system are fun and the stereo is killer. Very roomy. Sits high and has great visibility all the way around. I've looked over every inch I can think of and the fit and finish seem flawless. I have read some criticism about the front disk, rear drum brakes and you would think it has disks all around with the very effective braking I have experienced. It's not a sports car but it is great for a small SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride, handling, and comfort. Stereo, nav, and Sync. Certainly the fuel economy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got my white suede loaded Limited I4 09 Escape. Great little truck! Seat feels good to drive in, and tons of buttons to play with, I mean use! Plenty of power to merge on to freeway or get in front of trouble, etc. My son likes riding in the back seat. Strong AC/fan and heater, too. The little touches like ambient lighting are cool, too. Didn't get the pretty but expensive Nav system. But the Voice Sync controls work great anyway. Linked my phone to Sync in less than 30 seconds, works great. Now I never even take my phone out of my pocket to make and receive calls. Love the Audiophile sound system, too! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>SYNC! Mileage 10mpg better than our Explorer! Power is good, mileage is better. Feels great to drive in. Small, but lots of room, good mileage, and still feels like a truck, not a car on stilts. Safety features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Donn't buy an 08. The 09 has a bigger engine, 4 wheel anti lock brakes, a 6 speed automatic trans. The steering is smooth, easy, and I can turn shorter than my 2000 Focus. The ride is quiet, smooth,and the bucket seats are very comfortable. I bought the white suede with camel interior. The car has everything on it except Navigation, heated seats, and outside mirror. I just had reverse sensors added yesterday. Oh yes I have the leather seating too. Sirius radio is great and not that expensive when the free radio expires.</TEXT>
