<TEXT>Purchased my black C70 in August. My initial impressions are great. I wasn't expecting Vette performance, so acceleration/ handling are adequate. No shudders/creeks in the body top up or down. Exterior design is beautiful- by far the most attractive Volvo. Interior also designed well-- drivers seat is comfortable and very adjustable. Chose standard sound system and I am pleasantly suprised by the acoustics. Both the iPod and Bluetooth interface are awesome. Some of the interior bits and surfaces could be of a higher quality (dash, wheel, door trim). The key is cumbersome, and I wish I'd opted for keyless with this car. Overall, I love the versatility and design.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>appearance inside and out, iPod interface, driver seat comfort and adjust ability</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>C70 is a beautiful car that exceeds my expectation of how livable a convertible can be. The folding top is a marvel to see in operation and the interior is Scandinavian simplistic. This car speaks of adult sophistication.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Waiting for the weather to get much nicer so that I truly enjoy the open top experience.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>While not up to the performance of a BMW, this car is smooth as silk. Acceleration and handling in normal driving are very good. The hardtop works amazingly well. It is quiet with the top down. You can actually listen to music with the top down at 70 MPH or have a conversation. The seats are supportive and comfortable even for my husband at 6'2" and 230LBS. The car looks great with the top up and fantastic with the top down. No fooling around with a cloth top or boot. Sound system is quite good and I just have the standard one. I can listen to music with top down just fine. This is not a car for a sports car enthusiast, but for me going to the golf course and work it is just great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hard Top, Smooth handling, quiet engine, styling, acceleration and handling in normal driving, Blue tooth phone connection, Great trunk for a convertible. 5 speed automatic transmission is very smooth</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Good experience driving top down but not when the top is up. It generates too much rattles from plastic panel door and roof</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased this vehicle last week and love everything about it. I am a big man and fit in the vehicle just fine. It is a great car to show off and certainly gets everyone's attention when it changes. My kids have named the car after Jazz in the Transformer movie because it really is a noticeable change. I like the feeling of security that the car brings and I am very pleased with the performance. The car has plenty of power actually more horsepower than the V6 Mustang convertible that I was also considering. It really is two cars built into one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Keyless entry is an awesome feature. it is kind of strange to not have to worry about doing anything to open or start the car. The sound system is GREAT. I am hearing some portions of tracks that I swear I have never heard before and it is so clear even when turned up all the way on an open road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle after reviewing several others including the V6 Mustang convertible. I am pleased with the quality and luxury of the design. The nav system is relatively simple and intuitive. The audio system is excellent. The aggressive ability of the acceleration is wonderful.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav and audio are both great. Like the hands free key.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am a loyal Volvo customer and have owned a Volvo since 2001. My latest purchase exceeds my expectation. The car has a well thought out design both inside and out. The "tranformer" like hardtop puts on a fun show. My car is smooth as silk. And the bass on the audio is awesome. The turbo has a nice punch and you can pick up speed pretty well, but I don't think I will be drag racing this car. The room in this car for a convertible is surprising and even my over 6ft men in my life have leg room. The safety features that Volvo has included along with that smooth ride makes you feel safe and secure even with the top down. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sound system is superb. We like that you can customer set the surround sound. The speakers in the back seat "tickle your bottom" if the song has a strong base. This car is meant for cruising! The design of the valet key is SMART. I LOVE THIS CAR! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As a life-long Honda lover this is my first Volvo. The fit and quality sold me on the vehicle. Love the top fold- down, and the trunk space for a convertible. Best feature: DynAudio stereo, great sound and bass. The car turns heads with the top is down. Got 24K miles on the car and no problems. Two gripes: 1. Pirelli tires a (18 in. wheels) don't last beyond 30K miles (cost $300 a pop). 2. Navigation system stinks. An address has to be manually entered. No voice activated features (like my Honda). For a premium brand this is a surprise. </TEXT>

<TEXT>As a VW driver for years, I talked myself out of another VW when my last lease expired. I do like my C70 and find it stylish, but I miss the zip of my 4cylinder turbo charged VW Passat.I test drove an Eos in my search for a new car, and bowed out due to unsteady feeling of that car. In retrospect, I'd have given this purchase more thought....</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The hardtop roof, trunk space is awesome for a convertible</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The C70 handles beautiful and is fun to drive. I was very surprised at how large the trunk actually is. The interior is comfortable and quite. The blue tooth connection is also a great feature.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The retractable hard-top is great. Operates quickly and looks so much better than a rag-top convertible.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> Excellent exterior and interior styling; interior is understated and straightforward with intuitive controls. Trunk and backseat are both surprisingly roomy (best in class) for a retractable hardtop. Roof function is smooth and quick. Low-end torque is a little weak, but the turbo makes for a zippy little passer once it is underway. Fuel economy is great. This car is a well- kept secret, making it pretty unique. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling. Fantastic sound system. Big trunk and backseat. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Smooth handling and head-turning style go hand-in-hand in my 2009 Volvo C70. On a recent trip to Southern California, the C70 averaged 32.6 mpg. The car has plenty of low end acceleration and if one is not careful, it can creep up to 75-80 (or faster) mph very quickly. Interior styling, while conservative, is ergonomically sound. When the metal top is lowered, people stand and stare as the jigsaw puzzle neatly tucks into the trunk. For a convertible, the C70 does not disappoint in adequate trunk space. I carted two full sized reptile tanks and two pieces of luggage with no difficulty. Compared to an Audi A4 or BMW 3 series (both more expensive), the C70 holds its own very nicely!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Broad shouldered styling,a dynamic audio system, and the slick folding roof design should keep any convertible lover happy. Handling is another strong feature of the Volvo C70. Also, the C70 runs nicely on regular unleaded.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Smooth as silk when shifting this manual 6 speed. Excellent interior headroom, not a claustrophobic feeling like some front windshields give you in convertibles. The hardtop splits into three pieces which still allows for excellent storage in the boot.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Huge trunk. Smooth 6 speed shifting. Nice dolby speakers</FAVORITE>
