<TEXT>Just returned from a 3000 mile road trip. Odometer just rolled over 30,000 as we returned. Last leg of trip, 1400 miles, got 31.4 mpg with average speed of 65 mph. Best ever. It was comfortable, responsive, easy to drive at up to the 90 mph we cruised on some Utah & Idaho roads where posted speed limit was 80. High winds didn't bother it. Neither did some sharp mountainous turns. Good job, Volvo! MUCH more responsive and comfortable than our 1999 XC-70.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good road handling in turns. Like the transmission for braking. Works well steep terrain.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving an SUV, I was looking for a great sedan that could still transport the family and all of our stuff. This is truly a luxury vehicle and I love it! I plan to keep this vehicle for 200,000 miles!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort! Smooth ride, very roomy and great trunk space. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been extremely pleased with this car. I had never owned a Volvo before but the experience has been great. It drives very well, it's comfortable and has been extremely reliable. I get 25-28 MPG driving mostly highways. I would recommend this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Memory seats, computer, triptronic transmission (even though it doesn't hold the gear as I would like)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've now driven almost 7000 miles with my S80 V8. No mechanical or other problems. Sound of the V8 is great, very civil background roar without getting obnoxious. Mileage isn't so bad, with average driving (city and commute), I get 24mpg highway and 18mpg real average. Don't agree the body styling is boring. The old S80 was pretty boring but the 2007 & up model has a nice refined look, to my taste. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I also considered the A6 3.2 and the 528, but even with the V8 and almost all options (navigation, rear seat entertainment, premium sound, the works), the invoice price of the S80 was $12,000 less than a loaded A6 or BMW. My perception of the overall qualtiy and value of the car is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My fifth Volvo, the best yet. At 23,500 miles I'm getting 28 MPG on the highway at 75 MPH with and average of 25 MPG city/highway. My car is loaded less rear seat intertainment system.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's quiet and has a great sound system including satellite radio. I love it. Build quality and ride are superb. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is now my fourth Volvo (with my wife's fifth). I started with 850, then to the S80 2.9, the S80 AWD 5cl turbo, and now, the all powerful S80, V8. What a machine! Loaded to the gills. Only hiccup: guzzles gas like crazy! But if you want power from a Volvo? This is the one to get. Plenty satisfied and sharp design also.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The pickup speed from 0-60</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This may be the ultimate Volvo. I now have 3000 miles on it and like it even more than when I bought it. I most seriously considered the Infiniti M35 as I wanted to try something other than a Volvo (I have owned 5). However, safety concerns, gas mileage, and the way features are packaged individually led me back to the Volvo. A test drive of both cars sealed the deal. The Volvo seems to have a better feel for the road. It is smooth, yet extremely responsive both in handling and acceleration. It is the best Volvo yet and may have already sold me on Volvo the next time as well. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The blind spot sensor has been very useful without being intrusive. The adaptive cruise control can be helpful and may have saved us from one slow speed crash. However, it can be annoying when it believes one is going to hit a car which is making a turn and will be off the road before one gets there.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in a 2006 Infiniti M35X for the V-8 S80. In my opinion, the S80 is a nice blend of the BMW 5 and the Lexus GS.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V-8, AWD, ride and ease of controls.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Used Volvo's superb overseas delivery program. Drove car in Europe for two months from Sweden through France, to Monaco and back through Italy, Austria, Germany, and Denmark back to factory for home shipment. Excellent performance including almost 25 mpg fuel economy. Car was a joy to drive in the Alps as well as the Autobahns. In small towns and crowded metro areas, this is definitely a big car. But its size gets respect on the Autobahn as smaller cars yield to this big Swede.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sports package afforded great handling in the mountains, Xenon lights (that turn) were very effective. Great seats with cooling. Great seats. Big trunk. Good sound (iPod ready). Outstanding styling inside and out.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked up a new S80 3.2 on June 4. Over a 2 month period, drove to the Riviera, back north through Italy, Austria, Germany, and Scandinavia (for home shipment). Lots of driving in crowded cities like Paris, winding back roads as in Provence, Austrian mountain roads, and German Autobahns... the car performed flawlessly. We averaged over 23 mpg in what I would consider some extremely demanding driving conditions and speeds (think Autobahn with cruise set at 150 KPH). On European roads, this is definitely a large car. But it drove nimbly and had no trouble running with the little guys. My Austrian/German relatives and friends thought the Big Swede is a veritable Rocket!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sports package! In the advanced setting, mountain switchbacks are no problem. The ventilated seats are outstanding. The Xenon headlights are fabulous. The new 3.2 liter engine is smooth, quiet, and powerful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the S80 because it had better styling, luxury, fuel economy and safety than the competition. Three months later, I'm still very pleased. A recent 300 mile trip got me 31.3 mpg at an average 64 mph with air conditioning! That's better than many so-called economy cars. It feels solid as a bank-vault, and definitely has that luxurious ambience. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I LOVE the programmable folding power side mirrors. The fold into the body every time I lock the doors - very cool for city life. I also like the memory seat which senses which driver is opening the door (by sensing the key-fob). Very cool. Also, the best designed interior around!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second S80, first was a 2000. The 2007 is a great car and very comfortable. No one beats Volvo seats, friends even comment on it. Love the way it rides, handles, style. Still have the first S80. I hope this is as good as the first car has been. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Best Car For Money!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Wow, is all I keep telling myself. I picked up a loaded S80 3.2L on a 24 month lease and LOVE IT! I had a 1999 S80, and after many issues with that car, I looked to Lexus, BMW, and Mercedes. After test driving the 2007 S80 and comparing it to the competition, the S80 was the best car for the money. It drives like a dream and the amenities are endless. It is simple, elegant, easy to use, and sooo sexy! Only wish she was a bit faster - but dealership says there will be a software upgrade for the lag. Simply the best! Already have 3,000 miles - no problems!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>BLIS, adaptive cruise control with crash warning, sport package with air conditioned seats! Adjustable suspension! And my favorite - active bi-Xenon headlamps. And not to forget, the personal car communicator!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had a 240, 740, 850, S70 and prior generation S80. This is the best so far. V8, AWD, Audio package and you feel like you are in a different world. Quiet and agile.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Was going to buy another BMW 5 series, but wanted something a little different. Drove a few cars, but came back to the S80 because of price and the fact that I haven't seen any on the road. While nothing handles quite like a BMW, I've been pleasantly surprised with this car. It's super comfortable, has all the bells and whistles (air conditioned seats, nav, keyless ignition), and is a joy to drive. Plus, the stereo system rocks! I plan to put on some 19" or 20" rims. Very cool car with some very cool features. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>REALLY comfortable seats; sound system; keyless entry and push button starter; smooth ride; price. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is fun to drive, gets great gas mileage, and is by far the safest car i have ever owned (which has become very important to me with a new baby!). I have owned both Mercedes and BMW's in the recent past, and this car is more exciting, and has more cool features than either one of those! there is this thing call the BLIS (blind spot information system) that tells you if someone is in your blind with a light on the front A pillar... Very cool, and useful!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The adaptive cruise is a very nice feature... it will actually brake me to a stop if the car in front of me slows down, or even stops!!! </FAVORITE>
