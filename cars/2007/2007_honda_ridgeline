<AUTHOR>WhatWasIThinking?</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I bought an RTL in May of 2007. I loved it but traded it 15 months later on a 2008 Jeep Saraha Unlimited. I knew very quickly that I had made a BIG mistake. The Ridgeline is just a great truck. It tows reasonable weights with ease. People are critical of the mileage, but it is a truck. It has the convenience of a truck, the towing of a truck, and the ride of a car. I love the convenience and security of the in bed trunk. The ride and comfort was fabulous. My next purchase will be a New 2010 Ridgeline RTL with navigation! Don't make the mistake that I made. If you want a do just about anything truck, at a reasonable price, with a good track record of reliability the Ridgeline is the best choice!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I loved the comfort, the ride, the value, and the in bed trunk. The truck is full of innovations that only Honda seems to produce. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have enjoyed driving my 2007 Honda Ridgeline truck, however, it has come to lease end and I will be turning it in for a new 2009 Acura TL w/Tech Pkg. I have nothing but praise for the Ridgeline. It did have an electrical problem (computer chip and electronic board fried) within a month after my purchase. Also, the handles above the right and left rear passenger doors came loose and was about to fall off. Weird since I don't ever have passengers back there. The service department said that it probably was threaded wrong at the factory. Also, the back lighting on the heated seat HI/LO button (drivers side) kept burning out prematurely.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bad weather traction and then some...Probably one of the best winter handling vehicles that I have driven. It almost took the fun out of trying to do parking lot doughnuts because you couldn't without disabling the traction control switch.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you are looking for a truck that can do it all - go drive the Honda Ridgeline for a day or two. I did & I was sold! Honda has done a great job designing this truck to be so many things. It hauls (I have a boat it hauls w/np), it's a passenger SUV, and you can store an unbelievable amount of items. The back seats flip up creating an enormous amount of room to store items you don't want in the truck bed. Even with the back seats down you have ample storage under the seats which is nice on trips where people in the back can store articles they want to access during the trip. The TRUNK (THE TRUNK!) under the bed is what sold me on this truck - after the ride and many amenities. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Well let me tell you that Honda did a fabulous job at making a nice truck. My parents bought me it lightly used for my sixteenth birthday. Easily better than any of my friends' cars. Has never done me wrong and it's the most innovative truck I have ever seen. My favorite thing about it is its looks. It looks better than any truck and is only rivaled by the Avalanche in my opinion in the looks category. I love how its not one of those super duty trucks that is all about work. It actually looks civilized, not like it has to haul very large things all the time. The engine disappoints me but I'll just put an air intake and exhaust system to get more HP. It's just a little slow. Great truck!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought mine new in 2007. Love it! Perfect for most guys who don't use a truck every day, but need it once in a while. I have 3 kids and they fit comfortably in the rear. Love the Michelin tires! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the trunk and the two-way tailgate. Very smooth, comfortable ride that feels more like a car than a truck. Excellent traction in all conditions. I had to have the transmission replaced at 34,000 miles. The dealership did it in two days once they were able to determine that it was slipping while in drive. I have pulled boats and trailers totaling more than 5K lbs with no problem. Not as easily as my V8 Tundra did but adequately.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Not a reel truck? So what. It does what most owners need with more comfort, safety and refinement than any pick-up I've ever driven. 30 sheets of plywood laid flat? No problem. Bales of hay? NP. 1,500 lbs of concrete? NP. 40 sacks of fertilizer or horse feed? NP. Towing a 26 foot Catalina 250 (sailboat). NP. Commuting 3 kids to school, rowing etc. NP. Taking a family of five on vacation with all the toys they need. NP. REAL truck owners are just jealous of our trunk, independent suspension, squeak and rattle free interior and reliability.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Trunk, ride comfort, practicality, refinement, reliability, composite bed. I love giving REAL truck owners their first introduction to the Ridge. The skepticism leaves them about the same time I show them the plywood wide bed and pop the trunk. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my 07 Honda Ridgeline used with only 7K miles on it and it was 1 year old from date of purchase. I have driven all wheel drive vehicles before and this is the most all the time sure footed drive I have ever experienced. I couldn't go back to a 2 wheel drive vehicle again. I was driving a new Honda Element and hated it so I traded it for the Ridgeline. If you need a truck every once in a while but like the SUV all wheel drive handling then buy a Ridgeline.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the trunk in the bed. All pickup should have one. It is huge and has a drain plug so you can ice down your drinks for tailgating etc. It handles super in any condition. The all the time all wheel drive is so sure footed you can blow through any bit water puddle or dirt road anywhere.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What's not to love about this truck? When you price a Tacoma 4 door and see that you can buy a 4wd Honda, well that's a no brainer. The ride is so much better than a Ford, Toyota, Chev. It's a truck that will last almost forever. Comfortable driving, easy access/egress, transmission is very smooth. Getting groceries and just placing them in the storage container in the bed, have something leak, no problem, just pull the plug and hose it out. I love the way the back seats fold out of the way. There is tons and tons of room for for vacation. Find an antique, no problem. Love to garden, well this truck is like a best friend (never let you down). Bottom line, this is the most truck for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The storage just goes on forever. The comfort of the ride. Gas mileage, face it, 20 mpg avg is not bad at all and it doesn't require premium gas like Toyota. We really like the size of the truck. My wife says it's so easy to park and fits our garage perfect. Trust me, you can't go wrong.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Ridgeline, 45,000 miles on it, and I finally had to do brakes. Other than that oil changes and tire rotations. I am averaging 17 mpg with mostly city driving. I commute 35 miles per day 6 days a week on all back roads other than the last 5 miles of the trip is highway. Love this truck. It does everything I need and the trunk is the best. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I fell in love with this truck because one it had the honda name attached and because it was different than the domestic trucks comanding the road (other than the Avelanche). I wished that the truck inside would have been more stylish with more curves rather than the cuts like the knee room for the driver! Plus maybe an additioanl option of a V-8? and u thought that the MPG could have been better but it is still decent.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Vehicle handles very well on the road, accelerates smoothly with 5 speed automatic. Displays are very clear, steering wheel mounted radio controls nice, A/C with dual zone works very well. Door handles oddly shaped, but you get used to them - actually is designed with ergonomics in mind - you'll see. Rear window slides with push buttom. Rear windows go down all the way. Rear gate easy to open/close. Trunk in the bed water tight and roomy for suitcases (medium sized) or lots of groceries. Rear seat folds up and has plenty of interior holding capacity - does a 30/70 split. Seats area a little firm, so make sure everyone likes that before committing. Radio is has static; only bad item.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a chronic back problem and the inflatable lumbar support is really nice. This truck is FUN to drive. I listen to classical music and Tenors and I sometimes stay in the garage when I pull in from work because the stereo with built in subwoofer is very close to being in a concert hall.I have the aluminum roof rack and aluminum side steps and a silver pin stripe on this black truck and people to turn and look. These additions really dress up the truck. I'm so happy to get out of a 2 door coupe and really love all the space i now have</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the ridgeline for 2 months now and I love it. It is a great mid-sized truck and all the bells I need. It is made by Honda so it comes with all the quality, reliability and consistency Honda is known for decades. I haul my fishing boat every weekend and have had no issues. Ride is smooth and it is great to take camping with the in-bed-trunk. The back seats are very roomy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is supposed to be a truck. Everyone raves, Motor Trend names it "TRUCK of the year" and I ordered one. It arrived 3 weeks late, and it's basically a jacked up accord. The "bed" if you can call it that is useless, it has low approach angle, and scrapes on the most miniscule inclines, it has no ground clearance, and no torque! The passenger's rear door didn't close right and I had to take that in to be fixed. If this is what Honda considers a TRUCK, they are sadly mistaken. It will be sold after next April, and I'll be looking at Toyota and Ford. And looking a LOT more closely than just at Honda Trend Magazine. Those guys must be getting bribes!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had Toyota, Ford, and Chevy trucks. Not since the Toyota have I enjoyed the build quality (meaning fit and finish, you know...stuff you just "feel") of the Honda. The design has taken some getting used to, but it does everything I need very well. Now, if you NEED a "big man" truck for major hauling and a huge bed for cargo, this obviously isn't your truck. I almost bought the new F150 Supercrew (my last truck) this time, but the quality, safety features, gas mileage, and innovative features sold me in about 2 minutes. I am averaging 17-18 mpg highway with AC on full time, and I am heavy on the gas pedal. My friend's Ridgeline gets about 22 mpg hwy w/no AC running.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Used for long (7 hour) commute with tools and gear. The head rest is kind of a pain in the neck, but everything else excels for this class. Full size rear passengers prefer my truck over the Dodge ram 4 door. Visibility is great, and most importantly, the rough northern roads I drive on can not kick the rear end out on corners and ruts, even when driving on packed snow. Around town I have used it to haul .5 yard of gravel, also filled the box with bedding sand. It handled better than my Silverado did with the same weight... but I did have to spend some time washing sand out of the trunk lid seams and double operating tailgate. Keeping it around 55 to 60 miles per hour gave me avrg. 18 mpg</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle in late 2005 due to its extensive safety features and fuel economy within the price point. I have now put less than 2K miles on it and am ready to sell. Why? Gas mileage running 12-13 mpg rather than the 16-21. Blind spots make the vehicle difficult and dangerous to drive for a petite driver. Significant blind spots occur in right rear due design and rear headrest configuation. The headrest design should be abolished. The curvature forward makes it very uncomfortable and many people turn them around defeating the purpose. Impossible to judge distance when backing up due to blind spots.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this truck to replace my Nissan extended cab pickup for a couple of reasons only. I wanted to use this for long trips and accommodate more people comfortably and be able to haul small stuff including yard waste, pull small trailer with riding mower etc, etc. I have looked at all brands and came to conclusion that the Ridgeline gives me the best value for my money plus Honda's excellent reputation. So far my ridgeline has been performing well with no major hiccups. A few times the tire pressure monitoring light came on during cold days and disappear after the truck had been running for some time. That was it, but I'm still on the look out in case it happens again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The bed lockable storage is awesome. The interior is roomy and flexible for hauling large stuff. Rides like a car, handles well and plenty of get up and go for me. The stereo and cd player is very good. The one I like the most is the 4-wheel drive capability. It's there when you need it. I love it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the most enjoyable truck I've owned. To the point my own father is thinking of getting one for himself. Consider he's a loyal GMC fan. Anyhow I'm in the military and its a dream to drive, it reminds you of driving a car. But you have to convince yourself your in a 4x4. Take one on a test drive and you be the judge.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We loved our Honda Ridgeline. Great truck, my husband used it for his work as a construction supply company owner. He frequently hauled building materials with this truck. He also drove it long distances without a single problem. Everything was great about this truck, until it caught on fire today, and is now sitting in the towing company's lot, waiting to see what can be salvaged. I've been a loyal Honda/Acura owner for years, we also own a Civic and an Acura MDX, but we will not be replacing this Ridgeline with another Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Most fun to drive since my 67 Mustang. Safe and stable on snow and ice. Climbs MT mountain highways doing 80 with no problem. Pulls 14' dual axle flatbed and 8x12 cargo trailer with ease - although gas mileage takes a severe nose dive. All of the comforts of my Accord, with the ability to haul loads - and I've hauled lots of rock, wood, brush. All wheel goes everywhere I need to go, including mud, snow, ice, and some very rough roads, plus off road - short of boulder climbing. Lots of places to store things, comfortable. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lockable trunk, safety features, two-way tailgate, large handles and knobs, especially good in winter with gloves. Handling is superb for a truck. Stable, hangs to road like slot car. On long drives (MT to CA) - biggest problem, keeping awake, miles just tick away. Lots of innovations.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am more then satisfied with my Ridgeline. I purchased it less then a year ago but I have a decent commute and have taken it on numerous roadtrips. I just got back from going over a mountain pass with snow/ice, etc. NO PROBLEMS with getting the Ridgeline over. Tight steering, smooth ride, super quiet even at 80+MPH (country highways). Rugged enough to take on trails... wouldn't recommend for more than moderate "four-byin" (4x4). Exterior design is very unique. If you like the Chevy Avalanche, you'll enjoy the Ridgeline. It's essentially a Sport Utility Truck along the same lines of the Ford Exp. Sport Trac, etc. Otherwise GREAT truck HIGHLY recommend.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In 20 yrs owned 3 GM full sized trucks then Suburban. Needed to go back to PU. Tired of American quality vehicles and associated repair bills. Finally went Honda. Ridgeline has been in shop for scheduled maint only. 55,000 miles and everything still works. Drives like a car - golf clubs fit in rear trunk. Whats not to like? Reminds me of a bulldog, ugly to look at - and I love it unconditionally.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear trunk - seals tight and has drain plug. Bed liner is standard. A/C and heat. Very nice 160 watt 6 CD changer/XM radio. Rear seat OK for a PU and folds up for large items. Quiet ride. Lots of inside places for storage of stuff. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you want a luxury sedan, it's close. If you want a work truck, it's close. If you want a tow vehicle, it's good there too. I just towed a 4200 lb. trailer over 4,000 miles with my Ridgeline, and encountered no problems. Going over the Rockies sometimes required full power for several minutes, but the temp. gauge barely moved. Very stable, even when semi's. passed by. The cab is roomy, and it is fun to drive. I average 19.3 MPG commuting 80 miles, but the mileage dropped to 11.2 towing. The Ridgeline is, in my opinion, the most versatile, high quality vehicle available.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First off, I would have to disagree with the editors on two points. First, the comfort of the backseat. It can fit four 20 year old guys comfortably with no complaints. Also, its offroad capabilities (though not up to rock crawling standards) seem to be vastly better than the Ridge is given credit for. I've taken my RTS all over God's green earth, through dirt, mud, snow, creeks and have yet to feel a noticeable slip. Now, moving on. I am absolutely in love with this truck. It's as big as a house inside, it rides as smoothly as a town car, the bed will fit anything from pallets, to tree trunks, to drywall etc. And when I take the time to wash off the filth, it's a beautiful design.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>In-Bed Trunk: Works GREAT as a cooler, you can load it up with about 150 lbs of ice and any number of gallons of alcohol and its a moving tailgate party. Independent Suspension: I drive over train tracks every morning and while everyone else slows down to 5 mph, I don't even know it's there at 45 mph</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am not your average truck owner. I am an Elvis Impersonator. I carry lots of music and lighting equipment in this truck very often and Everything fits! This RTX handles like a car but feel very safe, quiet and secure. Starts, steers and stops with precision handling. Inside, it will surprise you with its "Roomy" feeling. All controls are within easy reach with No fancy frills. Engine is smooth as silk, trans too. "Pound for Pound" comfort & value, over other full cab brands, is off the charts with this truck! Will seat 5 adults adequately & have full cargo in back too. A lot of guys will complain about gas mpg, I don't. Go drive a U.S. made truck and you wont either! RTX..fit for a KING!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>In bed trunk and spare tire tray holder. The side open tailgate. Inside Head room is very good, I am 6'1. Extra large interior "Shovel Handle" door handles are great for my big hands.

<TEXT>Replaced Nissan Frontier with the Honda Ridgeline July 2007. Has many great features plus the reliability of a Honda. I don't require a true pick up most of the time so its payload capacity is fine, really like an SUV in most respects. Gas mileage on hwy is a little disappointing for a V-6 engine, currently about 20 mpg. Honda made a mistake by not using one of their more powerful Acura V-6's, as this vehicle doesn't have the power or torque required for towing or climbing hills. We travel from FL to NC mountains on a regular basis and it works hard to climb the hills. If I required a truck to tow anything, I would not have purchased the Ridgeline.</TEXT>

It has tons of storage inside and the in bed trunk is very cleaver. This is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned, fit and finish is perfect also.

<TEXT>After a year and 14,000 miles, I have had no issues and love the truck. Thought rear visibility could be better until I drove my bosses new Silverado and realized mine was not so bad. The mileage has ranged from a low of 17 to a high of 22. 60 to 65 delivers around 20 - 21. Engine/transmission combo is extremely smooth, just like our CR-V. Even with gas prices approaching $4 per gal, I think I made a wise decision. I have had many positive comments on the appearance and feel secure when driving. </TEXT>

Driving on all roads is stable & firm. Direct vehicle response from steering input. Good road feel. No mechanical problems. Very quiet motor almost whisper quiet. low wind & engine noise at high speed. Brisk engine response when you need to move quickly, & then you realize how fast you are moving! V6 is appropriate. Moved the truck nicely through hills & motoring through long high speed turns was comfortable & inspired confidence. 42 fill-ups later, avg 17.2 mpg overall. Purchased through broker & saved $K. Very happy!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Family just loves the navigation system. Useful feature is the listing of phone numbers for restaurants or businesses so you can call ahead. I appreciated the heated seats and heated mirrors in the cold months. My wife is partial to the dual AC temperature control settings. (Hers and His).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving minivans for the past ten years I decided to move up to a truck. Although not a truck guy in the traditional sense, I wanted the utility of a bed for those weekend beach runs and a comfortable rear seat for my three kids. I got both in the Ridgeline. Plus it's smooth, quiet and fun.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The in-bed trunk is just brilliant! I can fit two full sets of golf clubs and accessories in the trunk. During the winter, it easily accommodates my son's extra large hockey bag and skates. Power sliding rear window is a nice touch.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just purchased a 2007 RTL with Nav. And we had to make a trip from Montana to California, the Navigation was great, won't buy another vehicle without it, Everything is great about this vehicle except for the front seats, they are way too hard for long trips, we just couldn't get comfortable(we had to buy cushions to put on the seats)Honda Company should consider putting Acura MDX seats in this truck and make the steering column telescopic. I had trouble getting close enough for the steering without my knees hitting the dashboard, and I'm only 5'5". If those two things were corrected this truck would be a definite 10 all the way!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Honda built a vehicle that meets 95% of a truck owner's needs. We've received quite a bit of snow this year in Chicago, and the truck has handled it amazingly. My family feels very safe and comfortable in this truck. As for rearward visibility, buy a couple of $2 1.5" convex mirrors for the exterior mirros - helps a lot. The vehicle is extremely versatile - can haul 1500 lbs of rock during the day and take 5 adults out for the evening. Tows pretty well for occassional use. Gas mileage is as expected given the stance/aerodynamics. Corners pretty well given its size/height. Great summertime vehicle too (all windows go down all the way, and with sunroof/rear window almost convertible like).</TEXT>

Added the roof rack, side step to help with the looks (which I'm still getting used to). Overall the truck has exceeded my expectations. Pros: very comfortable in the city and on the highway, great AWD mgmt system, good (not great) stereo, back seats fold up, tail gate lays down and swings open, great storage space between the front seats. Cons: Mileage, front end needs to be redesigned, bed is a little too short. Best buy for the price. Shop well. Sticker was $31K, I paid $26k including roof rack, side step and bed extender.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck is fun to drive. Has a superior stereo system. Great quality of workmanship. My friends have deemed it the "swiss army knife of trucks" due to all the great engineering that went into it. Gas mileage is "ok" (17.8 MPG on trips with tires at/near top PSI) I guess for an AWD vehicle, but I am certain that Honda could make it better by using the new engine innovations from the new Odyssey minivans. For a truck topping $30,000 MSRP, I expected heated outside mirrors and a rear window defogger like the Honda Odyssey of my wifes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the Ridgeline in May '07. PROS: In-bed locking trunk, good handling and great turn radius for a truck, extremely comfortable and roomy interior with extra roomy center console, decent power from V6. CONS: Horrrible gas mileage (under suggested sticker), terrible blind spots making it very hard to see to your left, right, or rear, base stereo system lacks any mids (I have heard better quality from a ham radio), seems like you have to gas it to accelerate at a decent pace. All in all, it's a very good vehicle if you don't mind forking out loads of cash for gas or backup or change lanes often. Those two issues are enough to have me trading it in this week.</TEXT>

They removed the windshield, tore apart the dash, passenger A pillar. Nothing worked. Regional rep came heard the noise and said "Normal for a truck. It is result of body flex."

<TEXT>I had an OJ Simpson 1995 Bronco for a little over 10 years. It was reliable, drank gasoline like a thirsty boozer and rode like a vehicle from hell re lack of comfort. I'm retired, fly fish, pull small boats, go off road as well as drive in town and local trips. Ride is good. The grandkids love to ride in and prefer it over my wife's Lexus. The mileage has been a disappointment with an average of about 16 per tank. I normally beat the estimated mileage, not here. The lack or real off road under vehicle protection is a pain. Apparently, that is due to the Honda lawyers. The vehicle hauls everything we have needed to haul. The lockable trunk in the bed is great. Buy one</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride and the sure footedness of the AWD are superb. Tailgaters not paying attention to their speed on curves soon back off as I seldom hit the brakes.

Handles anything 99% of owners will throw at it. First Honda I've ever driven, & I'm very impressed with the overal quality & design. Unibody provides solid ride on highway & rough roads. Like driving a bank vault. Excellent braking and decent cornering for a vehicle this weight and size. Averaging about 18mpg with mixed highway/city driving & less than 5K miles. Bed scratches white, but a $75 bed mat took care of that problem. Will take other reviewers advice & get rear mud guards. </TEXT>

It's not perfect but it meets all my needs in what I really need a truck to do. I am glad I choose this Honda, I hope it is more reliable than other trucks I have owned in the past. For a truck like vechile this is a dream to drive, period, easy to park too. I had it a month now, so far I have found nothing I can't live with as is. I wish I had bought it sooner.</TEXT>

Even Consumer Reports had but one gripe, "pronounced road noise," which I can't pick up anywhere. I wasn't expecting the 250 hp 3.5 litre V-6 to be racy, but a buttload of horses rear up when you prod her to merge in with the interstate stampedes. Keep in mind I had the acceleration of a Porsche before. Riding up high with front and curtain-side airbags makes me appreciate the impressive safety ratings. Roomy interior can seat 5 easy!

<TEXT>Once my husband and I got past the exterior we found this to be a fantastic family "car". It is another one of Honda's wonderful vehicles. We've owned several Hondas before this and have found it to be as great as the Accords and Civics. It can boast of great usage of space and a comfortable interior. It drives better than our other truck and the 4 WD has come in handy. Five people ride comfortably with plently of luggage room. We love the "trunk" in the bed. The instruments are easy on the eyes and most everything is within easy reach, except the cruise button was a little hard to find.The tonneau cover keeps everything dry and secure. I most definitely can recommend the Ridgeline!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The "trunk" in the bed is our most favorite feature. Adding the tonneau cover was well worth the extra expense. There's plenty of places to store your stuff within easy reach.

<TEXT>I've had my Ridgeline for 7 months now and put around 7500 miles on it. I traded a 2004 Acura TL on this truck due to a change in commute requiring AWD in the Winter. I never thought I'd be a truck person, and to be honest the looks are not my favorite, but you can't argue with the total package. This is the safest thing out there in the Winter in terms of AWD, airbags, stability control, traction control. It did really well last year during our late Winter storms. Fuel economy got better once broke in. It went from 15 to 17 around town for me. I have a mixed commute of about 24 miles including 5 miles on a mountainous road and I'm averaging around 18.5 MPG.

I didn't buy this vehicle to do heavy towing or off-roading, but to do the everyday things like going to/from work, running to Home Depot, picking up some groceries, carting the kids to practice, etc. It is very comfortable for me at 6'4".

<TEXT>Great truck! Rides like a luxury sedan and handles like one too. Honda build quality is excellent. I've owned only domestic trucks since I learned to drive and this one tops them all. It doesn't have the payload or towing of the others, but like me, not many need to be able to tow a house. Gas mileage is pretty good for a 4wd truck (19 mpg combined - not broken in yet). Innovative features are great (in bed trunk, composite bed). To complete the package, the safety features are top notch. Six air bags, stability control, traction control, ABS - what more could you ask for? Only complaint is that it is a little goofy looking, but when your behind the wheel, you forget all about that.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I shopped around for the truck with the best fuel mileage rating. In Canada it may be different, but the rating the Ridgeline had was 28 miles to the Gallon. The Tacoma was 27. Between these two I preferred the Honda as it had more available options that I was Looking for i.e. loaded. Unfortunately, I have yet to do better than 22, and as last winter progressed I did many tanks at 16.5 miles to the gallon. The mileage just isn't their, a major disappointment. I believe the vehicle is underpowered for its size with a 3.5 l engine. The Tacoma with its 4.0 gets better mileage, and better power. If I had it to do over I would have gone with the Tacoma.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great truck on ice and snow, very sure footed. A pleasure to drive, very responsive. Well built, great features, the in box trunk and adjustable console is very convenient. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Honda's initial shot at producing a truck was a huge success. The truck's in bed trunk is huge and the dual action tailgate is extremely helpful. Although the exterior of the vehicle is quite conservative, it's functionality makes it a step above domestic and foreign rivals. The interior is quite comfortable and did a fairly good job at dampening road noise. The back seat is very big...plenty of room for three adults and when the seats are lifted, reveals another huge cargo area. The power rear window is great at getting fresh air in the cabin without getting wind turbulence. I was very impressed with the quality of the 160 watt sound system. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cargo Options: Huge in bed trunk, cargo lights for bed and lifted rear seats. Dual action tailgate. Surprising good sound system, minimal wind noise from sunroof (compared to wife's 05 Pilot), power rear window, lighted audio/C.C. on steering wheel, comfortable seating for five. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This truck is a heavy feeling truck with a six cylinder that is well matched. The pick up is snappy and strong. The in-bed trunk is a great idea with uses that are not immediately appreciated. The fit and finish are tight and solid. The cab is roomy and this rig handles like a car never forgetting it is a rugged truck. Gas mileage is at 16 mpg most of the time. Haven't done any long hwy driving so I don't know how well it does for mileage there. This is a useful rig for anyone who not an on the job construction worker. The bed is 5 feet but wide enough for a full sheet of plywood. The technology under the hood is outstanding. Electric everything. Honda quality can't be beat!</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you are looking for a truck to haul a big trailer this is not the truck for you. Otherwise, i highly recommend it. Build quality is excellent. Power is good enough to tow smaller boats and trailers. In bed trunk is awesome and i'm getting 21 hwy mpg. All around good buy. Liked it better then the Tacoma after driving both. </TEXT>

<TEXT>If you're looking for the utility of a truck with the ride of a sedan you've found the right vehicle. It's comfortable handles well, acceleration is more than adequate, has great visibility, and gas mileage is good for a vehicle of this size. Interior is spacious, having plenty of, leg, shoulder, and head room for all 5 occupants. Controls are well placed and made of quality materials. Side airbags all around, brake assist, and stability control standard. Its hard to beat this vehicle's list of features for the price. Simply put, a great vehicle.</TEXT>

In bed trunk is a godsend and fits alot. my brother has a new toyota tundra and was sorry he didnt test drive this honda first. Rides like a car. Not a vehicle for serious off-roading. But more then capable in snow and other rough terrain.Do yourself a favor and drive the Ridgeline before buying in other model. You wont be sorry.Also gets over 20MPG HWY. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one of the most comfortable and responsive trucks I've ever driven. It's so nice to drive that I often find myself taking the "long way" home in order to enjoy it just a little bit longer. Zimbrick's customer service is above comparison, too, and that certainly is a bonus. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Unless you intend to off-road, the Ridgeline is pretty much perfect. The ride is smooth, quiet, and refined. The engine won't kill you with acceleration, but it's better than adequate. Inside materials and design are amazing. Safety features abound. Perfect for long road trips, daily commuting, and everything in between. Gas mileage is better than expected-- 18 in mixed city/freeway, up to 22 or 23 on road trips. Only complaint is that the exterior is very susceptible to dings-- the paint/body hardware could probably use some reinforcement. People who review this automobile poorly probably have never been in one. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>In bed trunk. Back seats fold up to provide cavernous room, enough to fit my mountain bike. Every safety feature imaginable. Front seat storage compartments hold everything.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far the Ridgeline has been a joy to drive and work out of. I am a contractor and my 5 x 8 trailer loaded with tools and material is no problem for this truck to haul. It has power to spare. I live in a part of the country that gets it's share of snow and the truck's smart AWD system has no problems negotiating unplowed roads. The jury is still out as far as fuel mileage is concerned. With out the trailer, I'm lucky to get 15 - 16 mpg in town, but that is a far cry better than the 8 mpg I was getting with my full sized Dodge Ram.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After debating between the 2007 Ridgeline and the 2007 Ford Sport Trac, I went with the Ridgeline and am glad that I did. The Ridgeline is a wonderful, tough truck and drives like a dream. I am not a truck person per se but need an open truck bed for Home Depot runs and hauling two large dogs around town and this truck fills that need and more. The in-bed trunk is the best as it is located at the tail gate, the Sport Trac's large in- bed trunk is located behind the rear window so you would have to get up into the bed just to put something in the trunk. For the first 1,500 miles, I have been averaging 18 mpg in the City. Not bad for truck this size. The V6 engine offers plenty of power.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you, like me, own two gas cans, three propane bottles, and a Great Dane, BUT have to commute 40 miles a day to work and back, you want both truck and very well-built car too. Ridgeline is both, and does both very well. Last Honda I had went 200k miles over 13 years with no issues, so how could I not go Honda again? Love the truck, rides very smooth, extremely safe in bad weather, computers are smarter than I am and keep me out of trouble. Only drawback is gas mileage, I'm getting 17 city, no highway test yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a genuine Ridgeline owner, and not one fabricating stories to sell a different brand or discredit Honda.This truck is not perfect but serves my needs very very well. My landscaping business and the tools that come with job can be hauled by my truck as if their is nothing at the back and surefooted in snow. The many awards this truck garnered is a testament to its merits. Anyone accusing Honda of bribing the award giving bodies is hogwash. I mean you can bribe one or two award giving bodies but close to 12 award giving bodies unanimous in praising the Ridgeline meant one thing, those awards aren't bought and much deserved. Kudos to Honda for reinventing the truck. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned every truck brand sold in America and the Ridgeline, hands down is the best driving truck I have had. The roads here are rough and slick in winter and this truck handles excellent on icy, snowy roads. The back end stays stable and it stops on a dime, without even changing to all winter tires. I agree this isn't a brute to take out on bad dirt roads, but for occasional truck needs and an everyday commuter, this is an excellent choice in all winter conditions Alaska has thrown at it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>i normally drive a Chevie tahoe. this vehicle gets the same fuel economy on the highway and worse in the mountains. It is very rough riding. It is much noisier. Its turning radius is terrible. I pulled a trailer and got 9 miles per gallon. I am trying to get rid of it and it has less than 5000 miles. I bought it because of the size and storage. With 240 plus horsepower, I thought it would be better for passing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The best competition to the Honda Ridgeline is the Toyota Tundra. The Tundra is great, but I selected the Ridgeline because it has a shorter length and thus easier to park, has the all important better safety ratings (5 star vs. 4 star) for driver and roll overs (4 star vs. 3 star), has better mpg, has a locking waterproof trunk, gives a more comfortable ride, and is a welcome departure to the boring look of the age old pickup truck. While the Tundra offers shorter braking distance, 500 lbs. increased weight, a super quasi Lexus designed V-8 engine, is reportedly stronger off road, and tows about 1,600 more lbs., on balance the Ridgeline is the best choice - it is "as good as it gets!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable ride, super nav system, locked waterproof trunk, folding rear seats, aesthetic appearance, best mpg of comparable trucks, combo of 5 passengers and shorter length eases parking, great range of option choices to gussy it up, it is truly fun to drive, it is simply the best choice out there</FAVORITE>
