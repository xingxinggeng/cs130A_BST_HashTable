<TEXT>i purchased my pacifica from carmax in raleigh and it has been nothing but trouble. i purchased it on 16 aug 09 and it has been in the shop 4 times and this last time they still don't know what's wrong with it. each time i took it to be repaired the techs kept telling me the noises were normal. it took the sup of service to ride with me to tell them the noises weren't normal. the car has been with them more than with me. maybe they should be making the payment. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased a Base Pacifica, I am a traveling sales representative. It is nice to have room for samples and golf clubs. I put over 1,000 miles my first week and so far I like it. I hope it proves to be a reliable vehicle. The only complaint thus far is the large blind spots but the big mirrors help a little. William</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the Pacifica used with 5,900 miles on it. Nothing but trouble. We owned two 05's and they were good one great one fair. We liked the car. THEN the tyranny started bucking (Would not down shift when going up an incline, (Not fixed we were told this is a problem with the Pacifica. Motor mounts four sets in 20,000 miles. The dealer says this is normal and a better mount has not been designed because the Pacifica has been discontinued. Good luck when the warranty is up. The trim has (all but three pieces) has been replaced and is spotting again. The driver?s seat shreds the seat cushion when the seat motor is engaged, AWFUL NOW a noise is starting to come in the front suspension! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned the Pacifica for a while now, and still love it! Wanted the base model so we would only have two rows of seats. Engine performance is very good for only 200hp and a 4,400lb curb weight. Really powerful around town, breaks the front tires loose easily. Passing power (45-70) isn't that great, but not too bad. Handles curves very well considering larger size. Surprisingly, its a very good tow vehicle. Hardly can tell the trailer 2,000lb trailer is back there. Interior has held up well, but the seats get dirty very easily. Regardless, interior is beautiful and well put together. Love the sleek exterior, the car gets many compliments. I average 22mpg. Around 18 in the city, 25 on the highway.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated leather seats, 6-CD changer, towing ability, self-leveling rear, DVD player, folding second row (use it when camping, tons of stuff will fit in the back), rear seat legroom, cargo capacity, impressive gas mileage for size and weight, bright easy-to-read gauges, timeless sleek exterior design.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is great. We had a killer winter in New England last year and we had a set of Goodyear snow tires installed and with 4 wd this was a cacoon against anything that winter threw at us. Braking and confort are out standing. We had one mechanical problem with a transmission axel seal that was repaired under warranty. The car is quiet and the six speed transmission is very smooth on acceleration but sometimes get confused on quick stops or when doing a rolling stop when the light changes before a complete stop. It clucks and Chrysler flased the transmission which has improved shifting. The 4.0 L motor is a gem and works well on regular gas (89 octane is suggested). 5 star crash rating!!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Motor, motor, motor. Get the 4.0 L if you buy one. Highway comfort is outstanding - this car is a real cruiser. Standard sattellite radio is a plus. Headlights are stylish and they throw a nice clear beam. The radio controls on the steering wheel is a nice touch as well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned my Pacifica for almost two years and it has never had to go back to the dealer. I give it regular maintenance and it drives like a dream. I use the car for everything and I average about 22 mpg (Not too many long hauls in Hawaii). It gets up to speed quickly and stops quickly and straight. I have experienced the chatter of the trans between 1st and 2nd and 2nd and 1st at slow speed and that Chrysler "cure" was a flash to the engine computer. I have not taken it to the dealer as I don't want it to end up worse than it started. I have not had the opportunity to speak to other owners as Pacifica's are not that prevalent here. </TEXT>

<TEXT>One week after purchasing my 2007 Pacifica we had to have the drive train replaced. A while later it was lunging forward and jerking at times when accelerating. Dealer could not find anything wrong. Took it back several times before they finally found the problem. It has been in for transmission repairs 4 times. Last week when I went to take my kids to school, it would not move. The emergency brake spring broke and shot through my rear brake. ABS light and traction control problems are constant! Look up complaints on the Pacifica and you will find out a lot. I would never purchase a Chrysler vehicle again. I do not feel like my family is safe in this car.</TEXT>

Bigger engine, back up camera and just a few nice features to make a great car even better!! The lease programs on this car are the best out there!

<TEXT>My 2007 Pacifica has the best fit and finish I have ever seen in any Chrysler product. It is also very comfortable, performs well, and has a great ride. It handles very well for a vehicle its weight. However, if you buy one and you believe you are going to get the EPA rated 16 city 24 highway mileage, you are dreaming! I don't know whether Chrysler has to provide certified results regarding the EPA numbers, but if they do, they are "fudging" big time. 13-14 city and 18-19 highway is more like it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always liked the Pacifica style since it came out. I wasn't really in the purchase mode, but drove by the dealership and saw 3 new/used Pacificas on the lot. The gas prices were close to $4.00 a gal. & the price of full size autos were going down. Driving it easy, with the 6 speed transmission, I was getting 19.8 in town, and 29.9 on the highway. It rides so smooth, and the performance is unbelievable! It is totally state of art. Load leveling, traction control, ABS, anti-out of control feature? Over 250 HP. 3500 towing tounge wt. I love my Pacifica. I plan on keeping it for a long time. Again, due to gas price, I got a very good deal. monthly payment is $350. I have the FWD, not AWD.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The way it rides, how much power it has, 6 speed transmission, comfort, room, Stereo, steering wheel cruise, & Stereo controls. I put new tires on it, with raised white lettering, It just look's, and drives Great! I love It! Other people comment on how nice it looks as well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The first thing that struck us about this car is the styling. Although they built it in their minivan plant, it is a much better looking car. The updates for 2007 are a must have. The 6 speed transmission is giving us around 17 mpg in mixed city and highway driving. We see better than 22 if highway speeds are kept at a reasonable level. I agree that the more powerful motor and extra two gears in the transmission help the car to be quick off the line but it is also one of the most relaxed highway cruisers that we have ever driven. The crash ratings are unmatched in its class. The seats are very comfortable and the dual zone climate with rear heat control means that everyone is comfortable. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We bought the touring awd model and have found it to be a good car. I am not happy with the depreciation rate but that is a common problem with many domestic cars. We plan to keep the car for a long time so the resale value is not the most important factor. AWD and 5 star crash ratings rule!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I agree with many of the reviews that I read-- the car is a great design however, at 10,000 miles this car lost it. The transmission was "clunky" and with several transmission upgrades it seems to just keep coming back- as many of the others! It has broken down twice due to a gas gauge/ tank problems- as I am learning a not so rare issue. For this-- it is unreliable! After numerous trips to the dealer it still happens. I am tired of it! Why would this car come with a 6 disc DVD changer and no screen? Broken motor mounts- also common in the 2007.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>OHWHYDIDI BUY</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Bought this car because I drove several test vehicles at work and was impressed. Tracked down an '07 (deals were sweet with employee price + rebate). Found an AWD Touring with the NAV package. Drove great for about 40 miles, then the suspension clunking started and the water pouring in through the rear roof at the first hard rainfall. The list goes on. Dealer resolved the leak (missing gasket on the roof antenna) and the other defects. The bad ball joint sound is still present and both dealers (went in 7 times in 2 months) say that it's a "normal" sound. I wonder why the 5 I drove at work didn't do that. Dealer says it's annoying but they all do it. Crappy uncaring dealers.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gets 18/26 mpg when I drive normal. Great interior. Fit and finish are quite good. Rides real nice (except for the annoying clunk - working on that with the resident engineer who says he can tell the dealer what to replace - at least I have that option - what about the REAL customers out there?</FAVORITE>

I know Chrysler didn't market them well but I've had an S class Mercedes, a 540 BMW and 40 other cars and this is my favorite. It is great on fuel if you consider it's 2 1/2 tons and gets 30+ mpg on the highway and about 20 in the city. I've just finished a trip to New England and the miles are effortless and I'm over 60 years old! I'd recommend one to anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had to get a car for a new sales job where I travel daily. Needed more room for people, and displays. I traded in my Lexus which I just loved, I never thought that the Pacifica could ever compare with the Lexus. Was I surprised. I got a 2007 touring model with the 4.0 and 6 speed trans. This is by far the quietest, nicest riding, comfortable car I have ever owned. The stock stereo with Sirius satellite is unbelievable with a pounding bass and clear sound even at high levels. The ride rivals that of the finest European cars. ( I have owned BMW and Lexus prior). The 4.0 has plenty of get up and go and very fun to drive. Love the interior and get plenty of compliments on the styling.Love it</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our Pacifica to replace my wife's VW Passat. With only 1 kid, and a growing family we needed something larger, but not as large as a mini van. Not quite to soccer mom status yet. The 4.0 L is a great engine with adequate power, and plenty of pep. 6sp transmission is very smooth. Handles great. The back hatch is almost exactly 48" inches wide (at it's widest) I just put a sign in it the other day with all 4 back seats down, worked great. The one major draw back is backing up. There is a pretty big blind spot, and it takes some getting used to. Back up sensors would be helpful(didn't come with ours). My wife loves to drive it, we highly recommend this car! too bad no more after '08</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the Pacifica based on seating & ride comfort for my wife (bad back) & she picked the Pacifica from among many others. The exterior fit & finish are good but has one minor door mis- alignment. Paint finish is excellent. The interior is most comfortable. We get 26+ MPG on the highway and in-town mileage at 19+ MPG. We're very pleased with the fuel mileage. Ours is FWD with the 4.0 L engine & had only 14K miles when we bought it. I love the 6 speed tranny with the "Power-Shift" feature; but I am concerned about it's reliability as I read there have been problems with the TQ. Time will tell! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We like the dual temperature controls, large interior, 3 row seating & easy of entry/exiting. It drives/handles like a European automobile. The Sound system is great!

I love the radio controls on the steering wheel..right behind it, in the perfect spot. Every seat has it's own cup holder and air vents. I like the captain seats on the second row with the console in the middle. It rides 5-6 adults comfortably. The air bag in the front seat is cut on/off by weight, which is great for the 8-year- old that likes to ride in the front. There's rubber in the bottom of the cup holders that pulls out, so it's easy to clean messes! Dual air is great. I'm seriously in love!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle because my wife and I wanted a vehicle with a 3rd row that wasn't a mini van and got better than 20 mpg. I picked this out because the price was right. I bought it used with 10,xxx at under $18k. I'm a big guy at over 6 ft and 285 and I can comfortably get into the front and back seats, but I haven't tried the 3rd row (I own it so I don't have to ride back there.) MPG has been around 21.5 since we bought it. It has more of a car like ride than most SUVs but you still feel some roll on harder turns (it is based on a mini van frame). It is a comfortable ride for long trips, and has plenty pickup around town. Overall I'm pleased with what I got for the money.</TEXT>

I bought the Signature Series which is loaded up w/ navigation, power liftgate, rear seat DVD, satellite radio, heated seats front & back. Signature Series interior scheme set this one apart from other Pacificas. Pleanty of power and a smooth ride. The bad: in 12 months and 10,000 miles of driving, this vehicle has been through 3 torque converters, both sway bars links, a driveshaft, had a side view mirror come off and had a splash guard (the big sheet of plastic in the wheel well) fall off. Worst of all, trade in value is less than half of new MSRP ($34540). Appraised @ $16k.</TEXT>

We got the Touring, with the Spring Special. Grandkids Love the 8 in DVD Screen. Love the styling and handling on the highway especially with the 19 in. wheels a Classy "Car".

<TEXT>If you buy one, be sure to ask or have the Torque converter checked because there have been many replaced (including mine) in this vehicle, which I found out after the fact. The vehicle would start shuttering in the rear going up hills and they found out the TQ was the culprit. A new one fixes it, but can be spendy if no warranty. Otherwise its an awesome vehicle that I love driving!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were in the market for a crossover type vehicle to replace our explorer - preferably used (after seeing the prices). We narrowed it to the Edge, Mazda MX9, and the Nissan. When we got to the lot, there was a Pacifica there - we decided to drive it since we had some time, but not really considering it as an option. We loved it!! If you're looking at this style vehicle, you can't beat the drive and comfort of the Pacifica for thousands less (for a used vehicle). Definitely an overlooked vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have really enjoyed this vehicle. The 4 liter engine and six-speed automatic make it absolute fun to drive. I get about 16.7 mpg around town and 27.8 on the highway with A/C on and running at 70 mph. The only vehicle I have owned that bettered it was a '79 VW Rabbit Diesel. (Except for that I've always driven large vehicles). My special-ordered vehicle has HID lights which I love and backup camera with nav system which is also very nice. No moon roof which I hate. Mine also has dual exhausts. The brake response is the best I've had in many years. Likewise the steering. Throttle easily permits light, smooth getaways. Good driver's position. I also like the power liftgate.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>see above. Independent rear suspension is a big plus. It cost me $80 LESS than the Town and Country LXi AWD minivan I factory ordered in 1997, which I still have (63000 miles).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wanted to replace a 10 year old stationwagon with another one. After looking for two months at all makes and models of wagons, decided the Pacifica fit all my needs. After 7 months and 13,000 miles I wasn't wrong. It's more than what I expected. Great sport sedan handling. I sit up there with other SUV's and P/Us. It's one of the best kept secrets in the car world. The only thing missing is the pointed 3 star in a circle, but my bank account is not out an extra $20,000. It's the first time I've owned an AWD and even though I lose a couple of miles a gallon, at 65 years old I've got peace of mind while driving on ice and snow. A safe car for hauling my grandkids around. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased this vehicle in late December for $9,000 under MSRP. My wife and I are expecting our first child in June and need a vehicle to accomadate. The front, rear and side 5 star impact rating was important in our decision to purchase. The exterior styling is very aggressive and sporty looking. The interior is well designed but I understand why people have commented about the cheap materials used for construction in newer Chysler/Dodge vehicles. The performance and ride is what makes this vehicle stand apart from the competition. Acceleration is outstanding and the ride is very smooth and quiet. Caught myself speeding a few times well above the limit. Can corner fast without fear.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Low first gear for acceleration, styling, engine power, seat heaters front and back. I can't say enough about the drive train performance.

<TEXT>We traded in a 04 Altima for the Pac. It was great car and really good on gas which I miss but we needed more room so we went to the Pacifica which my wife was looking at for a while anyway. She wanted 3rd row and I also wanted 4wd so I wouldn't have to worry about her on snowy days. The ride is al ot quieter than the Altima and smoother. A lot more room for are 2 girls. I love the looks inside and out. I was skeptical about the leather but so far I love it. The get up and go is great. like I said the mileage is ok but I have a Nissan Titan that gets about the same as the pac. The kids love riding in the way back and are always asking me to turn the radio up and go faster which gets me introuble with the wife.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the radio controls on the steering wheel like my Titan is easy to get used to having that right there. I like the dual and rear air also. The 4wd works great but havent tested it in the snow yet. I also like how all four windows go down with one push of the botton and the rear seats go down easy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am a musician, and I need a vehicle that can carry a lot of gear. My worn out van was at the end of it's life and I was tired of getting no better than 15 MPG. I tested many mid-size SUV's, and there are several good choices if you want a rugged "off road sporty" type of vehicle. But I wanted something that could handle my cargo needs, drive like a true luxury car, provide lots of power with a smooth comfortable ride, has a stylish look and at a reasonable price. The Pacifica is all that and more. If you need a vehicle that can handle your big family, and/or some decent cargo loads, plus a smooth ride, lots of bells and whistles and some "get up a go", this is the one! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just replaced my wife's '04 Pacifica with an '07 WD Signature Series. The bigger engines was definitely a big improvement. This one has much more zip, even with A/C on. The ride is smooth, comfortable and quiet. I could drive this thing all day. The gas mileage isn't the best...not yet close to the rated mpg. We like the style and the feeling of safety of this big vehicle. However, I just took the car back to the dealer at 3,000 miles as the transmission "shudders at about 1800 RPM while moderately accelerating thru the gears. There is a TSB indicating this is a problem with AWD '07 Pacificas and the torque converter should be replaced. I hope this solves the problem. Otherwise, we love it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>All is well with our '07 Pac. We were finally able to get out of the house for a wedding in RI and all four of us piled in. The Nav system was fantastic! The fuel economy was equally fantastic, averaging 65-70 mph we yielded 26 MPG carrying a load of about 900 lbs. Around town we get 15 mpg. Honestly, we could do 800-1000 miles in a day with this vehicle. Between the DVD in the back, 4 heated, adjustable, tilting seats, the Nav system, and a 23 gallon fuel tank it was effortless. We stopped for lunch after 2.75 hrs and my son (6'4", 220 lbs) could not believe we were in the car that long. He was involved in the movies in the back seats.

People in front can listen to their favorites on beautiful stereo system, with subwoofers. Nicer design on the outside. The Pacifica says move over. 4700 lbs of safety for my family.

I love the location of the Navigation (in the dash cluster). The 19.5" wheels really make a nice add on. It does not lack any power and every gadget you can possibly ask for. We were looking at the Lincoln MKX but wanted a 3rd row seat and I am so glad we chose this vehicle. The ride is much quieter and smoother than the expedition was and not much less room.

It is roomier than the others, the third seat is even comfortable with adults. The placement of all the controls are convenient when driving. I especially like the electric seat controls, they are laid out just like a seat on the door, the lumbar control,even the adjustable peddles,and the heat seat controls.

No matter what highway speed you select, the engine is basically loafing (about 2000 rpm's)and has all the power you'll need for any situation. I was a little concerned on gas mileage at first (17 mpg with a mix of city and highway), but it has improved steadily to a now acceptable 21 mpg. For a vehicle with this much power and space, I can live with that.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The backup camera makes hooking up to my boat trailer sinfully easy. No more guessing where you are. I got the Signature package and like all the bells and whistles that came with it. Great sound system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased a 2007 Chrysler Pacifica and were happy until we had it washed. After washing we noticed that all chrome trim pieces were etched or corroded. We had less than 2000 miles and had the car only 7 weeks. We returned to the dealer and were told they would contact Chrysler. We have now had 3 conversations with Chrysler and they have basically said too bad that it is a normal condition in areas that use Mag Chloride on highways. I believe this is a defect in the fabricating process since we have had a 1999 T&C van for over 8 years and show no sign of this problem. This may be a problem in several northern tier states. Beware before buying Chrysler in snow areas. Very Disappointed</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've never bought a Chrysler before, I've gone from an Alfa Romeo to a Mercedes to a Volvo. I needed a big, comfortable car that was still stylish and this is it! I absolutely love this car. It rides smoothly, the interior is luxurious and reminds me of a European car. There are so many cool features that it's hard to name them all. Suffice it to say that I'm very happy with my purchase and I'd recommend a Pacifica to anyone.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Controls on the steering wheel for cruise control and Radio/Satellite/CD. I love the power liftgate, both up AND down! The second row seats having a reclining feature is a BIG hit with my son and his friends. They all say, "This is the life!" when they get in there.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2000 Dodge Sedan for the roomier Touring FWD in Magnesium. I shopped minivans and SUVs--needing a 3rd row for people and space for cargo hauling--and found this the better choice. I'm extremely pleased with the 07's power, handling, ride and features. So far fuel mileage has exceeded my expectations for the 4.0 with 6 speed. No less than 19.6 mpg in mixed town and highway and a high of 24 on the Interstate at um "good" speeds. Dealer experience was one of the best in memory as was the value. I recommend you consider the Pacifica. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power and relative economy of 4.0 and 6 speed Autostick. Passenger Room in the first and second rows. Making Side Curtains airbags and ESP standard for 07'. The ride and handling characteristics. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the 2nd awd. The touring awd was almost mechanically perfect, only real problem, too slow. Brakes were warped by 34,000. 07 ltd awd is really a fast auto. A great improvement. Trans. seems confused at times. Will wait on the 6spd and new engine review. 05 was using a lot of oil?? at the end.Changed it at 3000, went to 6000. and it was down 2 qts at the end? 1 of, If not our best cars still. </TEXT>
