<TEXT>Well, I'm not satisfied at all. I bought a 2007 Lexus IS 18 months ago, and I took a chance on this because there is no local dealer (I live 2hrs away). Unfortunately, I've had nothing but problems with it. I've gone through 4 tires, breaks and a factory recall on the exhaust system, in that time. I've been to Springfield twice and to the Toyota dealership 5 times now. I bought a car almost brand new, I shouldn't had to bring it in. I brought my car in last week to get the breaks looked at the local Toyota place, and the rep told me I had another bad tire (#4), so I called Lexus and told them. When I purchased the car I got the tire warranty but they said they wouldn't pay for the tire...</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car has almost 45,000 miles on it and I still love it. I previously owned an Audi A4 and this car is superior in every way. After the Audi, I could not imagine owning a car that was not AWD and was so happy that Lexus made the IS 250 AWD. I looked into the BMW 3 series and a new Audi A4 and concluded that the Lexus offered more for less. The car comes standard with many airbags, sun roof, excellent stereo, memory settings for both the driver and passenger seats, and superior leather quality. I opted for the luxury package and this car feels beyond luxury. The car is very sporty but a safe and solid ride. I have a long commute to work and am so happy every day that I have this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My baby gets 26-27 miles per gallon with premium gas. Had it for 2 years and still runs like brand new with routine oil changes. Everywhere I go, it still turns heads. A friend of mine bought one when he fell in love with mine. Here on Guam, the dealer provides free car washes, so the tire dust isn't an issue. The dealer said the dust is normal because the brake pads are softer than regular pads in order to help the car stop better at high speeds (my car can stop on a dime). A friend recommended replacing with ceramic brake pads when the time comes. So I'll be trying that to see if they work the same with less brake dust.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is very nice, however, The interior is very cramped, the reason being the car was built very narrow, the same issue with the GS, although the GS has more head room than the IS. If you're driving alone the car's feel is a little better, but for the most part it's very cramped inside, the interior is built very solid, but there was rattling in the dash that was eventually fixed by the dealer. The front rims are always extremely dirty faulty break pad design? Not sure. Handling around tight corners is OK but not great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For a 6 cyl car, gas mileage is terrific. Very comfortable, especially the adjustable heated and cooled seats. I don't drink coffee in the car, so cup holders are not an issue, however I definitely would like to see a decent coin holder. My IS 250 now has 12,000 miles on it and the dash sounds like it is going to fall off in my lap. The squeaks and rattles in the dash are very, very annoying and not expected in a vehicle of this supposed quality. Overall, I do like the car, however I don't expect that I will keep it the 3 years I initially thought I would when I bought it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2003 Infiniti G35 and was kinda of sick at first but as I drove the 250 even more it was awesome. The only gripes I have had about it is they have 18 inch low profile tires on them and after 15000 miles I had to have a new set of tires. They should have gotten at least 30000 miles before a new set, and the brake dust on the front is horrible. It needs a little more room in the back seat. I have owned BMW, Infiniti, Acura, Maxima and Hondas. This is one of the best driving cars I have ever drove. Very tight steeringm can hang a curve and has a lot of get up and go too. I have 3 speeding tickets to prove it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had this car over a year. Always driven imports and this is by far my best import car yet. Gas was at 4 dollars and this takes premium so I went with 2.5 instead of 3.5. This has a lot of power still and zips through traffic phenomenally. I enjoy this as a daily driver and now have 20K on this clean ride. Love the S curves and everyone loves the interior when they sit in it for drives. Little crowded in the back but hey its still a sports sedan. I use my mp3 player in it all the time. Great leather seats and navigation is a must with reverse camera! The tail is high when reversing without a camera. Slight road noise with Potenzas. I love the sport steering, great U turns and stops on a dime!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the navi, wood grain, sleek and sporty. This is a great great daily driver. I hate putting miles on it. Awesome sound system! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I shopped for an IS 250 AWD for about 5 months before getting one. I have had it for a little over a month and still love it. I have done a 1300 mile road trip and drive it to work every day. I am 27, 6 feet tall and my previous car was a 2001 Toyota Celica. Here?s what I think of the IS with reference to the other reviews on here- first, yes, there is brake dust on front wheels, but if you wash your car weekly, it?s no biggie. Pops from the dash? Some, but it?s usually only when the car is cold, after it warms up, they stop. I am guessing this is different from car to car. Basically, I wanted a luxury Celica- I got one. It?s fast enough for me, but I?m no racer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very comfortable for a guy my size. Four doors was a big step for me, so the back seat is fine. Trunk holds two sets of golf clubs. Nav is pinpoint accurate, BT phone is great and call quality is crystal clear on their end. Stereo is very decent for a stock system. Beautiful head turning car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love driving this car. Looked at Audi, BMW, Infiniti, Acura, and Honda and this by far was more to my standings. Yes, the back seat is a little small but if you're the one driving, who cares. I was torn between the IS 250 and G35. I liked how the G35 had more room but after doing a cost analysis the IS 250 turned out to be a better purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Love driving my 250 after 17 months. Occasionally wish I had bought the 350, but I would rarely use the extra power. The 250 and 350 handle great on freeways, country roads or around town. The 250 is a little slow out of the blocks, but has great pulling power at higher speeds. I didn't buy the car with safety in mind, but this is one solid car. Someone crashed into the back of my car at high speed on a freeway yesterday, resulting in one totally written off car and one lightly damaged Lexus. At the time of impact I was pushed into a sideways skid, but handling was phenomenal and the car was brought under control easily.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So this is the most sporty offering from Lexus (save for the IS 350, but that's another ballgame). This makes me seriously question Lexus' ability to build a sports car. The ride is great, the interior is comfortable, the options and gadgets are perfect, the exterior looks beautiful but where's the power? Where's the handling? Where's the fun factor. Sure, coming from a Honda it's greatly powerful and fun, but after recently trading it in and looking at offerings from BMW and Infiniti, this car feels like a slowpoke! For not much more a 328 or G35 would be exponentially more fun to drive. Sure, the luxury is there, which I love and appreciate, but the sporting characteristic is not.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car is capable of very good gas mileage. Engine response is delayed and acceleration is weak. However, very strong and capable once up to speed on highway. Suspension a little stiff but good on highways. Steering is quick and you need to get accustomed to it. Some break noise from front and terrible brake dust situation with front wheels. Very solid and fun to drive. Test drove a 330i and decided to go with the Lexus. I am satisfied with my decision.</TEXT>

<TEXT>overall great car. The exterior of the car is sleek and sexy but not nearly as sleek as the interior. The interior is very comfortable and i love the touch screen/navigation, very user friendly. Only my second car, but I like how the seats are heated and cooled. The handling is also phenomenal, I can make turns at speeds and make tight U turns I never could have with a 5 series. So far I've gotten the car up to 130 mph and everything worked perfectly including the handling.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Really great car!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I really like the ride. Reliability is really well and as a previous owner of a BMW I prefer a vehicle that is more reliable. Too many problems with BMW 328i. Great car in and out and the women love this car. Great nav, Bluetooth and rear camera is a must. Love the performance and the 1/2 second lag is not as bad as others say. Added a short air intake and feels more responsive. IS F-sport coming soon and looking forward to upgrading brakes all the way around. HID Xenon lights are wonderful and the ride is great and responsive. Again this is not a Cadillac it?s a sports car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the interior leather, love the cluster and its white bright lights and they way the cluster shows you are going to redline. Have taken IS 250 to 140 MPH and handles like a champ! Love taking this car on the S curves on the weekends!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I shopped the IS with the A4 and the 3 Series. Didn't like the way both Germans' headrests actually touched back of my head in normal driving position. The Lexus trunk was wider, better able to take 2 golf bags. I really like the styling of the IS. The build quality is good but not great. My car did have the center dash/nav rattles that others complained of but my local dealer seemed to fix it. I am disappointed with the way the car drives. Mine has sport susp. and tires. Handling is great but the ride is too harsh. Sport tires VERY road-noisy. The steering is the major flaw. Very fast and tight, but no road feel or feedback. It feels "sticky" and "dead." Very strange. Brakes grabby.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's been a year now since I bought my IS 250 and while it doesn't blow me away, I really do like the car. I had a rattle problem with my dash - it came from the center speaker. The dealer ended up replacing my whole top dash and now it's much quieter, but I'm also getting those loud pops that others are getting. I find the ride very bumpy on bad LA freeways. The suspension seems way too tight. Had a BMW 328i before, and while this doesn't handle as well of course, it has more interior comforts. I still love the styling and get lots of great comments. Gas mileage is perhaps better than stated. On smooth roads, fun to drive. For the $, it's still hard to beat, but I was expecting more.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This car really is hot and sexy. Nice interior layout and features. Keyless entry is great. PG gas mileage for car class. Heated and cooled seats are great. Base stereo system is VG. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned the IS 250 AWD going on a year now, and I still love driving this car!! Performance is great and I find that the AWD version handles very well, and living in CT, the car has done well in the snow! For the money the 250 has many luxurious features, but does have a some flaws! I had to have the car seviced twice to try and fix the popping noise from the dashboard and the rattle from the sunroof. Dealership was great and had a fix for both issues. The others would be the jumpy transmission at low speeds, first and second gear and the lack of room in the back seat. Overall, the IS 250 has delivered and I'm very happy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had no problems with lumpy seats or rattles, but have heard the pop noise coming from middle of dash; only happens once per trip. Heated/cooled seats are great; handles like on rails; plenty of punch, but wish the 350 came with AWD; has been great on snow and ice; ride a tad rough but an OK compromise for the handling; very quiet; love the LED interior lights; back seat is cramped, but front seat is fine for my 6'4" frame; averaging around 25 mpg; many more features and much more reasonable price than BMW or MB.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has single handedly deteriorated my impression of Lexus quality. My car has 1800 miles and has had to have the brake pads replaced due to excessive/constant squeeling after normal, flat terrain driving. The front dash has an irritating popping noise constantly that sounds like expansion which I'm told is normal and to simply accept it and we had to bring it in twice to try to find/address a rattling noise in the front driver dash. While the service dept is great - wouldn't it be better if I didn't have to go in unnecessarily to begin with? Very disappointed -- will likely not buy a Lexus again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, car has been great, but I am concerned over the interior quality of the plastic and seats. Lots of rattles coming from the dash area around the navi and entire dash. Have been to several dealers to fix the squeaking, and one dealer lifted off the entire dash and reset. Now the rattles are even worse. The front seat has developed a large lump where the fan unit is located, so sitting is very uncomfortable to say the least. I am really shocked over all the issues with a $40K car, and to make matters worse, Lexus Corporate has not responded to my concerns, and the dealer has stated "this is the best we can do." I hope they will resolve, but I am doubtful now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought my IS 250 because of great exterior looks, although it is starting to look a lot like a 4 door Scion to me now. Inside has tighter width than other cars in its price range, and there is not much leg room in the back, especially with the drivetrain hump. There's only a single cup holder on console, and it is only large enough for a dixie cup. No place to put wallet or BlackBerry either. Why have an ash tray -- no one would want to ruin the interior with cigarette smoke! Brake dust is more than an annoyance, impossible to keep wheels clean! Underpowered. Honeymoon over. My lust for exterior went away when I sat inside and could only see flaws. I will be trading this car in soon.</TEXT>

Rear seats are extremely tight and are not suitable for adults. Seats do not fall down to expand the trunk, but do have an opening for long items in the middle.

<TEXT>This car is fun to drive. The ride is smooth and quiet and I find it amusing when I use the horn and it does not sound loud because of the interior sound reducing qualities. Backup camera is great too as I live on a cul de sac and there are many kids that are playing. My wife and I have been on some road trips already and do not feel tired or achey when sitting for an extended period of time. Lexus logo that lights up blue on the door scuff plates is a fine touch as well. Overall interior refinement with the clean lines give it that final touch.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Absolutely love this car. Purchased it on my birthday and I fell in love with it during the test drive. The leather seats are so super comfortable and having a rear back up camera is a major plus. The leather heated/ventilated seats are also wonderful. A couple of things I don't like: 1) not enough console space to store things and 2) the brake dust is ridiculous and it is impossible to keep the wheels clean. I would definitely recommend this car to anyone. It has great pick up and provides a very comfortable ride. The backseat isn't super roomy, but it is functional. Would definitely buy it all over again. I love my Lexus! :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>Driving this car is a pleasure! I had to get rid of an impractical sports car (2005 RX-8 6MT) and needed true 4 doors, more space and comfort, and I got it without compromises! Yes, the shifter is easy, the Lexus doesn't make you work for a shift like the Infiniti G35 coupe 6MT did nor is it as precise as the RX-8, but it is more forgiving, allowing you to focus on the road and enjoying the great interior rather than focusing on making the quick shift. Yes, it could use more power, but I like the thought of my suspension being able to handle anything the engine can throw at it! Great car, in and out, love the 6MT and love everything about it!

<TEXT>I just purchased the IS 250 and all I can say is I love it. I was used to more horsepower (owned a 2005 Maxima) and thought I would miss it, but the ride in the IS 250 is so luxurious it makes up for it! The body style is beautiful and interior is equally as stylish. Best car in its class.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove the G35x, but I just couldn't get past the styling of the IS. The G35 greatly improved the interior materials, but it still didn't compare to the Lexus. Great touches and features like interior lighting, auto dimming of the nav at night tied to the dash lights and light sensor (and not just a manual nav setting), easy bluetooth, buttery leather, etc.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked at the BMW and Audi and made the only decision after driving all. The Lexus is not only better equipped, it's a luxury car in all aspects. The fact that it is backed by Japanese reliability and build quality nailed the South African BMW out of the equation; particularly as I am extremely fussy about my build quality. That left the A4, which is also a superbly built car, but after driving all three and in particular drive both and I was left with no doubt the Lexus is superlative! I should say Germans be very scared... but it's obvious the horse has already bolted!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The automatic fresh air system and the ventilated seats... why didn't someone think of this sooner? The overall balance and refinement is superb.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I used to drive a mercedes C230. I recently made a switch to the IS 250 Lexus. The car drives and handles excellent. The road noise was much less than the BMW 3 series and Audi A4 I drove. The interior is about as nice as I could find in the market and the car has not had any problems. It feels more like 240 horsepower even though it's rated less. It's very fun to drive. They really built a great car with the new IS. I'm never driving anything but a Lexus ever again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm in Toronto. Had it just after BoxingDay. Great car indeed. But the reason why I went for Lexus was for quality and quiet rides. To my disappointment, there's significant tire noise (i got 225/45/17 Dunlops) especially at highway speed. Bumpy rides add noise to interior. Got to turn up the stereo in order to "enjoy" my classical music. Hurts my ears at the end of trip. Faint squeaky noise from interior panels (doors, dash, somewhere at rear). Very small armrest storage. Jumpy tranny in slow traffics at 1st & 2nd gear, it seemed confused. Thinking of trading it in with an ES 350. Too bad! Sorry to say these negative things but they're facts. Should test drive it for a full day.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Silky smooth engine. Stylish design from inside out. Superb sound system even with the Lexus' own. Great gas mileage. Good enough horses for everyday drive (I don't race, I drive). Sporty yet elegant dash design. Huge exterior rearview mirrors!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I previously drove a Pontiac Bonneville, top of the line with lots of room. The reduced space of the IS took some getting used to; however, the quality, ride, handling, looks and gas mileage make up for the car being smaller. I chose metallic red with black interior. The wood looks great with the black! I test drove the G35, 325i and TL, and the Lexus won in almost every category: looks, handling, gas mileage, comfort, least ride noise and the list goes on. My advice is to be very careful not to scratch the hood since it's aluminum. I'm single and the reduced back seat room is no problem. My IS is always getting looks on and off the road; I highly recommend it. It's muscular & sexy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my IS 250 AWD for about a month now. I thought I was compromising on performance when I made the practical move to go with the AWD of the 250 instead of the 350.

<TEXT>Just purchased my Starfire Pearl in early March 2007 and it is beautiful. From the sleek lines down to the posh interior - as nice as my husband's GS 300!! The nav system is a nice touch and the rear backup camera is a must have as this vehicle does have some blind spots. The ride is smooth for a sports car and I felt the car abolutely gildes on the highway. It gets lots of second looks as the front end has such a presence as it approaches. The sound system is excellent - I love the iPod hook up. I have noticed the brake dust on the front wheels will be a continuous cleaning process but it is well worth it as this sports car is all luxury and pizazz!! Love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior - I mean it's awesome!! Rear back up camera, iPod hook up, and the ventilated seats. Also the cashmere colored interior makes the maple trim pop! I love the HID lights - you can see forever!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After having multiple Lexuses, we choose this as the perfect car for our son as a graduation gift. The safety features are comforting for any parent of an 18 year old and the AWD was a necessity for the New England winter (the car has proven to be amazingly competant in snow, even compared to my GX 470 for so long as there is less than 5 or so inches). The ride and handling is on par with BMW and the maintenance, or lack thereof, is better than the similar contenders from BWM and Audi.The steering is not quite that of BMW, but the car makes up for that in every other aspect. If you are considering anything from BMW, Audi, and especially Mercedes, the IS 250 should be on your short list of contenders.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The keyless ignition is always a fun trick and has proven useful on several occasions. The tiptronic allows for some more free revving fun and the looks of the car, both inside and out, are arguably best in class. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is by far the best car I have ever own or driven. IS stands for Intellegent Sport. And that is exactly what this car is. It is the most sophisticated sport car out there for under $35K. Also, IS has the highest safety rating of its class. That data was provided by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). If you just want a car for how it handles and speed, then I recommend the IS 350 or BMW 330 (for $40K+). But If you like all the options and great gas mileage (32 hwy mpg), then this car is you. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd IS (had '03 IS 300) and I love it even more than my old one. The new IS feels much, much more expensive than my last one, and definitely more luxurious than other cars in its class. I think the car is gorgeous, and it stands out from all the boring cars on the road. I got mine a week ago in silver w/ black interior, and have already recieved so many compliments on the car. I especially love driving the car at night with the HID headlights and the Optitron gauges glowing that cool blue color. Lexus really went to bat with this one, and I couldn't be more pleased. If I had more money, I would've sprung for the 350, but I can't say that I'm really missing the extra horsepower :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Lexus and what an impression it has made on me and everyone who has driven in it with me. Gorgeous car inside and out, a very smooth ride and gets a lot of looks. Lots of great standard features (keyless entry, leather seats, moonroof, auxilary port for iPod, etc.). As expected, the obisidian black exterior is difficult to keep clean but there's nothing like it after a wash and wax. If you want something lower-maintenance in that area, go for the Tungsten Pearl or Starfire Pearl. (This car looks hot in any color.) I opted for the 250 over the 350 for better gas mileage. Test drove the 350, though, and what a fun ride!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Never having to take my keys out. Bluetooth/navigation system... didn't think I'd use the nav as much as I have. Standard sound system is great (makes me wonder how the upgraded system must sound). Seats are super comfortable, and the ventilated seats are great (especially living in South Florida).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Switched from driving an A4 Quattro to this fun car. Love the drive, love the ride it is so smooth. The only down side is the navigation system cannot be controlled while in motion - most annoying if you have a passenger who can use it while you drive! It also lacks the abilty to announce street names like some stand alone units. The other down side is the rear seat does not fold down. The car is without doubt in a class of its own despite these minor anoyances. The finish is excellent and the attention to detail is fantastic. This car is loaded and drives like a dream. Try one and see!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Keyless entry is well thought out and so very useful. The sound system is great and links very well to an iPod. My favorite part of all is the pleasure I get driving it as this car really does drive so well. Am looking forward to trying out the cooled seats in the summer too!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned my IS 250 for 3 months and now really appreciate its qualities. Thought the car a little boring at first, especially compared to my wife's BMW 325 convertible. No doubt, the 325 is more responsive in all respects, but especially the steering response. The IS 250 is way too light and can be a little difficult on all but the smoothest of surfaces. As far as everything else is concerned, it's no contest. Gas mileage on the Lexus is far superior (a recent 700 mile round trip from Sarasota to Key West resulted in 35.5 mpg). The overall mpg over 2200 miles of ownership is 30.5 mpg. The IS 250 has the looks to turn heads.</TEXT>

The Black Sapphire is a beautiful color, the fit and function is wonderful and the drive is tight and responsive, without being dangerously fast (like the IS 350). Chose the IS 250 over the IS 350 because I couldn't afford the speeding tickets and for the gas mileage. I'm getting about 18 mpg in SF city driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I live in the metro New York area, and usually am in the car by myself. We have one child, who is 7 years old. My wife and I are both under 5'8" tall. I think the Lexus cannot be beaten for the money. It handles very well (although I have not had the opportunity to test it in the snow), and handles much better in the rain than my 2002 Audi A4 did. The conveniences in the car are wonderful, and a BMW with a comparable feature set was about 20% more. We live in a very hilly area, I spend less than 1/2 of my time on highways, and we are getting about 24 MPG overall. This is similar to what I got on my Audi A4.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Several months ago, I went on a massive hunt for a 4 door 4 wheel drive car, priced under $35,000. My candidates are as follows: Lincoln MKZ, Mercury Milan, BMW 3 xi, Audi A4 Quatro, Jaguar X-Type. I am very pleased with my choice of the Lexus IS250 AWD - a loaded base car that looks and feels fantastic. The V6 mated to a 6 speed auto (with paddle shifters) purrs like a kitten. It's quite capable on the highway and corners as if on rails. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Button on the dash changes the car to normal, sport or snow mode. It's much more responsive in sport mode- downshifts earlier and remains in the lower gears longer.

<TEXT>From the first test on the IS 250, I was sold on the silky tramsmission, fit and finish and quiet engine. I have had this car for less than a week and can not be more pleased. The power is a 204 HP so it is not going to jump off the line, but it is ample on the highway and remember it is that lowered HP that is more than making up at the pump. The rear seat is small, everyone comments on that but since I am single and rarely have passengers it is not a big deal for me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a long term BMW owner (325i, 325is and M3) but have grown tired of the electrical problems that seem to plague recent 3 series models. My Lexus IS 250 provides a firm yet comfortable ride. While perhaps not quite as athletic as the 3 series BMW, the handling and braking are outstanding. Add in the exterior and interior appearance, overall fit and finish and unbeatable quality of Lexus and you have a winner. The 250 provides enough power for most applications, but if you have to have five second 0-60 times, opt for the 350 which hits 60 mph in just over 5 seconds. On the other hand if you want highway mileage that exceeds 30 mpg, buy the 250 version. Either way you can't go wrong.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I used to own a 2005 Infiniti G35 Coupe that was badly rear-ended and decided to start fresh with a different car. For the money, you get a lot of bang for the buck with the 2007 Lexus IS 250 - LOTS of standard luxury features, a comfortable interior with upgraded materials and a visually striking exterior. The steering, performance and overall handling of the IS 250 is not nearly as crisp as it could be. All in all, the IS 250 will get you where you want to go in peaceful harmony. For those who hunger for more performance and better handling: get the IS 350 with the available sport-tuned suspension. Overall, you will find the IS 250 to be a great value.</TEXT>
