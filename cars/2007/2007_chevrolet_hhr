<TEXT>I am not very happy with gm I bought my car used with factory warranty to 1000,00 mi. The car has 53,000mi My transmission has been slipping I took it to dealer they didn't fix it they gave it a new gasket supposedly. tear down transmission, replaced side cover gasket. I'm not happy with gm I'm going to need to keep complaining for them to fix it properly. I'm worried transmission is already on its way out it sickens i bought car 2007 used 32,000 mi I luv style of car and the way it rides but I'm afraid of keeping it to long I think I have lemon signed depressed </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my HHR since November 2008 bought it used with 32,000 miles came with 12,000 bumper to bumper warranty from chevy. The dealership will lie to keep from doing anything under warranty. My wipers have quit repeatedly during rain storms. I make an appointment to get it seen to and they lie and say they checked it out but didn't. I have two recalls for my car but the dealership wont even schedule me to get the repairs done. says I don't really need them. the car did not come with runnerboards or mud flaps so every time you drive anywhere near gravel it flies up the side of my car and skins the paint in front of the back door and the warranty doesnt take care of that either </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the space. Used to love the driving experience but the longer I own it the more its same as any other car I guess one bad experience at the gm dealer makes me feel that way. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Has a good road feel and drives well, predictable, positive handling. Mileage around 27 winter and 31+ in the warmer months. Avg'd over 35 on a 1000+ mile road trip last summer. Nice smooth powerband but 2.2 won't snap your head back on inclines. Utility is well designed with the plastic floor and sides, rear seats that fold flat. Rear seat leg room adequate, comfortable. Driver's leg room a little narrow but sliding the seat back helps. Telescoping wheel would be a good overall remedy for this. Engine is nice if you do you own basic maint. Oil changes a snap with that top load filter, plugs easy access, fluid fillers, like that. Good daily runner. Economical, practical, comfy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good mileage & utility, comfortable. Large side mirrors. Convenient steering wheel controls.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my used HHR which by the way I just found out means: Heritage High Roof for 13 months. It does have a high roof but you can't see out the windshield very good at a red light. All in all I really like the car, (I hope I am not jinxing myself) the other members of my family always want to drive my car instead of their own. My mother can get in and out of it with no problem (which is a problem in other cars). I have always owned a van and at first I thought WOW how small, but I just went on a camping trip and was able to get everything in comfortably. I wish it had roof racks though. I have recommended this car to friends and family because of the price and reliability so far.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear space, stearing wheel controls (I can turn down my kids music without them realizing it), waxes really great, shiny, and most of all in todays economy the gas mileage is great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I started shopping for a roomy vehicle that i could afford and could afford to run. I didn't have the need for speed or a handling package since most of the work the car would be doing would be on the interstate. With the HHR I feel I hit the transportation jackpot. I regularly fit a string bass, 2 amps, several guitars, a sax or 2 and three humans inside fairly comfortably. Over the life of the car so far, I am AVERAGING 29.9 mph. Fully loaded on the hiway I've never done worse than 33.5 mph. Splitting the gas 3 ways at todays gas prices, that works out to about 2 cents/mile. The HHR is quiet, comfortable and very reliable. Easy to drive, a great turning radius and very easy to park.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy to use cruise control, liftgate instead of a door, HUGE underfloor storage compartment in back, infinitely configurable, great visibility, larger than standard side doors making in/outloading that much easier, extra storage compartment in dash easier to reach than glove box. Superior mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought my 07 HHR new in 2007. By the time 2008 rolled around it was worth about 10K less than the sticker price on a trade. The car was much better built then my 2004 Cavalier...but that does not say much. In my 20 months of ownership I had multiple electrical issues, suspension problems and fuel mileage down to under 23mpg consistently. It looks more spacious then it really is. I would be more likely to recommend this vehicle as a used car....don't get suckered in to buying a new one because it drops in value sooooooo quick you can't get your dollar's worth out of it before it will be off the road. My summary: Decent car, don't forget that you are buying a Chevy and it will cost you!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my HHR! I've had it just over two years and it has a little over 20,000 miles on it. I haven't had any major problems with it. I did have some brake squeak when it was new and that was fixed. I still get compliments on my HHR. Most people are surprised when they get in at how much room it has. Especially when I haul something in the back, they never think it will fit and it surprises them when it does! I get great gas mileage 30-33 on the highway and 25-30 in town, it just depends on how big a hurry I'm in! My Mom is considering an HHR for her next vehichle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior of the HHR, it reminds of an old woody and a miniature version of the old Chevy Panel wagon I also enjoy the remote start that came standard, the mp3 adapter and the heated leather seats!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned over 15 new years in my life and this is the first one that has absolutely no defects whatever. I just past my 36,000 mile warranty and no issues. The car is fun to drive, holds a ton of stuff, gets really good mileage (I routinely get 30 mpg city/highway mix), and the quality is what Chevrolet should be doing with all their cars. Tight, solid, no squeaks. The paint is as shiny as when new. Tires wear evenly. Transmission shifts smoothly and acceleration is more than adequate for a small engine. I wish the resale value were a bit higher but heck, I' m not selling it so I suppose it doesn't matter that much.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really love to drive my HHR LT, but the exterior body has gotten really bad. I live on a gravel road and the the rims are flaking off and I have absolutely no paint left in front of my rear wheel wells. It is starting to rust all ready and I have under 28,000 miles on it. Took it back to dealer at under 10,000 miles and they really didn't care. Have replaced the sway bar links already too. Just a cheap car. Gas mileage should be better than 25 average, but it's not. Bad handling in winter conditions also should be noted.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We absolutely loved our HHR Panel LT with its retro design. White with floor boards, heated leather seats, etc... Before the cowl seal leak that flooded the passenger side floor board and soaked the carpet with 3+ inches of rain water. It was fixed according to the local Chevy service department under warranty but, who knows? will it leak again? the thought of another rain water leak makes me sick! Fell out of love fast!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Sunburst Orange HHR for 7 months now. It sure gets a lot of looks. The pickup is great and it handles well 3 seasons of the year. I have 3 complaints though. It does not handle very well in the snow. (important feature up here in Canada) The cupholders and electric window buttons are awkward to reach. Other than that I absolutely love this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only owned my HHR about 3 months but the gas mileage is very good. The look of the vehicle is very appealing and gets lots of attention. It is a fun little vehicle to drive. I feel very safe and comfortable when I drive it. The only thing I could possibly think that might improve it would be repositioning the cup holders. I am not sure where but they are awkward to reach.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2007 HHR sight unseen, just because I loved the exterior styling so much. I hadn't even driven one until I took it off the dealer's lot. I knew from the first moment after that point that this was going to be an automobile that I would love, and I do. The smooth and quiet ride, I would dare say, is compariable to more expensive luxury vehicles, and the attention to detail in the manufacturing shows. Fuel economy is excellant, averaging 34 MPG, I can now go as long as two weeks between fueling, and I travel a good distance to my job. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The styling both interior and exterior are my favorite features, but most of all I love the versatile trunk feature with the two levels. We can put the baby stroller on the bottom and load 2 weeks worth of groceries on the top self above it, great idea!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>HHR is definitely a car worth your attention. It runs very smoothly and quietly, gives you great gas mileage (30 miles highway plus local in my case) and plenty cargo space. My HHR has a 2.4-liter engine for which premium gas is recommended (you can still use other grades but later on your engine may need to be serviced). I've noticed that whenever I'm driving up-hill, I really need to push the paddle to maintain the same speed. The only thing I don't like at all about this vehicle is the little compartment space. My previous car is a Geo Prizm (much like Toyota's Corolla) which is quite smaller than HHR. But Prizm has more space where I can put CD's, maps, stuff like that.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent retro-looking exterior design (biggest reason why I bought one); very quiet and comfortable and fun to ride; plenty of cargo space.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As a Suburban owner, I was taken by the design of the HHR. Being an "Old Guy", I love the '49 Suburban take. Also, I like the fact that the seating position is high and entering and exiting this vehicle is easy. I don't feel like I'm sitting on the floor boards. The build and quality of this vehicle is as good as I've seen on any US vehicle. Maybe it's because it's assembled in Mexico. At any rate, they're doing it right. I should say at this point, this report is on the 2LT with the 175 horsepower 2.4 liter engine. The 2LT isn't an option listed above for some reason. The 2LT has a larger sway bar and stiffer suspension. It handles way better, almost like a sports car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>There is no comparison between the HHR and the PT Cruiser. The HHR is roomier more economical and better looking. I average 29.5mpg cruising at 75mph in hilly West Virginia.

<TEXT>I have owned my HHR for about 5 months and about 6,000 miles. The car has been fun and economical to own. The 2.2 litre engine will not win any races but it moves the car with enough acceleration to make it fun to drive. The engine is quite noisey under heavy acceleration. Rock solid on the road with plenty of room for people and things. The interior is roomy and very versatile, and I love the fold flat rear seats. Overall has been a great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. I have had my eye on this car since the autoshow. I finally got it. I told myself i wouldnt settle... and i didnt .. its fully loaded... if its offered i have it. The radio is outstanding... the sound amazing. I love that i can store fm, am, and xm channels in the same category in the presets. The drive is amazing. The speed sensitive steering really makes a difference... who knew? It has good power for the size of the engine. The exterior color (golden teal) really turns heads. The remote start is great especially considering that its october and already snowing. Wow the room it has... its the best !!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I received my HHR on a Friday and was just starting to explore all the features when 4 days later on Tuesday, a gentleman ran a stop sign and I hit him going about 30-35 miles per hour. It was a very scary few minutes. I never even had time to hit the brake. No one was severely injured. I got out of my vehicle and walked away with only the injury from the seatbelt. The air bag also went off. The windshield never broke. There was no damaged from the front seats to the back of the vehicle. The front end took the whole impact of the crash. My truck was totaled though. It only had 345 miles on it. With the 5 star safety rating and my proof of it, I'll be buying another HHR.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sunroof, heated seats, and remote starter are just a few of the nice features. I didn't get to enjoy it for very long. Looking forward to getting better aquainted with the features when my new one comes in.</FAVORITE>

<FAVORITE>In the world of look-alike cars, it's hard to find something distinctive. It's different enough from the Cruiser to be unique, and not like anything else. The retro look appealed to me. I'm tired of the "organic" look of most cars today.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After a year of ownership - my complaints are few. I had a convertible before - but needed a practical car. The HHR fits the bill to a tee! It consistently gets mileage in the 30's, with the 2.4 liter and the 5 speed manual, the car is quite responsive. I wish the car had traction control (since corrected), I hate the cup holders and the window switch location (also since fixed) All in all - this car is for an active person who doesn't want their car to look like everything else on the road.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have an LS with the 2.2L automatic. Highway gas mileage is excellent, about 32-35mpg. City mpg about 23- 25mpg. Only complaint is the cup holders are not user friendly for the driver or the passenger. Otherwise, we love our HHR. Excellent headroom, and we love the retro styling of the interior. Great ride quality with little to no cabin noise. Visibility out the front windshield takes a bit of getting used to, but after a while, you don't even notice. All in all, a great car. We would recommend this car to everyone!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm very happy with the HHR however, I am from the northeast and this winter has been very cold.The reason I bring the weather up is in the morning when I get on the hughway the engine is quite loud. Getting to the highway I have a little dip or two to go over. When I do go over them it sounds like I lost my under carriage. After like five miles this to calms down. The car has a low front end so stay on well plowed roads. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I actually love the car , the ride, the, the mileage all fine. But, after a year and 9 months I had to take it into the dealer to have rust repaired on all 5 doors. The rust is in the doors where the seams are. If you look at the seam in the bottom of the doors you can see the rust bubbling under the paint. I took the car in and they sandblasted the door seams and repainted. I know a good deal about cars and I know for certain this car had to be assembled rusty! I don't mean to pile on when GM is down but maybe this is why. I spoke to my neighbor who owns an HHR who was not surprised because his doors had also been repaired for rust! Is GM building Vegas again? Just a word to the wise.</TEXT>

It is comfortable and roomy (even for a large person like me), quiet, zippy (yes, it really is, even with the 4 cyl.!), the heater rocks and will fry your face off from a cold start in less than 3 minutes (usually more like 1 minute in Texas winter!). Love the sunroof, love the styling, love it all. Wish I had gotten a lighter color (I have the darker red) exterior and darker color interior though. Almost my favorite car I've ever owned. (Still partial to my old Grand Prix GT!)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Remote auto start! Sunroof (I like the pop-up shield to block some of the wind), iPod jack, quiet and smooth ride and awesome stock radio. I don't even have the top of the line radio and that little thing rocks out; like the noise cancellation feature that makes it louder while you're on the road!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my HHR. I do a lot of driving and it is great for long trips. The sound is very nice and the 2 selling points for me are the curves and the leg/head room. I am 6 foot 2 and have no problems at all. I love to keep it waxed but I do not have running boards and due to the design the front tires kicks up stones and gravel to the point that the paint is destroyed infront of the rear tires. Chevy repainted it once but did not offer to put on the running boards. I am not happy that i have to sell it but it does not drive very well in the snow! I have to get a 4x4. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of leg/head room and the trunk space is more than enough for all of my needs. Love the look too and smooth ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently bought the Chevy HHR my driving experiance with the car is just awesome. It handles just like a high end sports car, ride is so comfortable. I took it twice too Little rock ark. from ft.myers fla 1200 miles each way the fuel economy is great averaging 29 to 31 hwy miles. I have the royal blue metallic. it has just the right amount of chrome to set it off and turn heads. The only drawback is where they put the power window controls. You have to take your eyes off the road to find them. If anyone wants a truly great auto in a small SUV try this one you will not be disappointed. More than plenty off horsepower and comfort and leg room. Get this one it's great</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have almost had 3 wrecks due to the blind spot dealing with the windshield pillars. They are very thick for such a small vehicle. The windshield needs to be bigger, when I put the visor down I have to slump down in the seat to seat under the dumb thing. GM did move for 2009 the window controls to the door they are a pain in front of the gear shift. The cup holders are too close together so you cannot have to larger cokes in them and then the armrest are in the way to get to your drink. It needs to have a console and lots more cubby holes. There is a lot of space that is wasted that could have been utilized for storage. The storage in the door is way to small needs to accomodate drinks</TEXT>

<TEXT>Liked the retro look from when I first saw the concept car, always been a Chevy fan but only owned their trucks (3/4 ton HD) all my cars had been imports. I traded in a CRV for this car because it was the most car for the money period! We saw an ad price for $12,500 for the LS and with my GM card discount we drove home in it for $11,500 brand new! cheaper than a cobalt or focus, or a less equipped hyundai! We love that the base model has so many features standard. Oh, and did I mention how great the mileage is? We average 36 on trips and have on one trip gone over 600 miles on one tank! For snow, we bought Bridgstone Blizzack studless and they are amazing! No need for AWD </TEXT>

<TEXT>Love my HHR and I won't give it up, but I hate that it has been in the shop so much. It is a blast to drive - especially since mine has the 2.2 with a 5-speed transmission. Great fuel mileage - average 27 mpg daily driving and 33 mpg on highway. Items replaced thus far, upper and lower steering shafts, front brake rotors and brake pads, radio (three times), front sway bar bushings, and body control module (related to radio issues). Running boards and Splash guards are a must if you experience winter driving conditions (protects paint on rear doors). Changed tires to Goodyear TripleTreads (Original Firestone Affinity tires were junk) and I now have better control, handling, and traction.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great retro body styling of vehicle. Total blast to drive ? consider the 5- speed transmission. Room for the whole family - including the dog (golden retriever).

<TEXT>This vehicle has been a mileage surprise. EPA estimates of 30 are often exceeded on longer trips. A recent 400-mile, one-way trip got 31 mpg with several in town stops, while the return, mostly non-stop trip logged 34.5 on the onboard computer, but 39 mpg when actually running the numbers on the calculator! This was at 59-60 mph for most of the way. This replace a 1994 S-10 Blazer that only did 24 mpg on its best days. I wish professional reviewers would quit putting so much emphasis on a vehicle's ability to rocket off the line. Except for race car drivers, we are not buying cars to win drag races. The HHR has plenty of power to accelerate from stop lights and to merge onto freeways.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned mine for about a month now. I love it. I did read the reviews prior to purchase so some small things I agree with. The door locks, why are they so tall. Makes hard to have your arm on door. Also interior easily staining is so true. I mean water on seats stained and that is so odd to me. I was frustrated as my car didn't come with trunk mat. I did shop around. The dealear wanted $104. for the rubber mat. I actually found a lot of them on ebay for $49. So check that out if you need one. Other than that all is great. I dont see any issues. Everyone loves it and my kids finally have room to relax. Great car don't hesitate.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorites are gas mileage. I like how smooth car rides. I love the color, I got the gold. I like the fact that windows where already tinted. Super affordable for the used one I got.

<TEXT>Car has proven to be very reliable. I have total confidence in the ecotec motor and GM transmission. Car is well built and everything fits, no rattles. You cannot hear or feel the motor inside the car. Car is quiet at speed and at idle. Handling is pretty good. I love the cargo utility & the fold down seats, I use it quite often. Very little maintenance is required. I had a few small problems with brake drums and vibration when I first got vehicle. Dealer fixed it all promptly and professionally. This is the first ever GM product I purchased new! I have no regrets, satisfied with my choice and recommend the HHR highly if you are looking for a small, efficient, family utility vehicle</TEXT>

<TEXT>My HHR has been in the shop 13 times in past year. I would be driving down the road and it wold just shut off. Burning smell, all kinds of electrical problems. Before 7K miles it had to have new bearings. It was in the process of Lemon Law and 1 week shy of owning it a year caught on fire while I was driving and burnt to the ground. I was lucky my children weren't with me. Gas mileage started out good almost 30 on the hwy and then went to no better than 21.

I could use a little more light, being that the windows are tinted and small it doesn't flood the vehicle with light.

<TEXT>I bought my HHR for my wife in 2007 for a nice car to drive back and fourth to work. Mileage has been solidly in the upper 20s with mixed city HWY. When we are on the open highway I have gotten as good as 33 but stick around 31 most of the time. The car is solid it is just a base but the auto start was a deal setter for my wife. Great little car. But just a few weeks ago i got a safety recall on the little beast. Come on GM get your heads in the game. This final recall is the last nail in the coffin for my GM purchasing days. I just bought a Ford fusion for myself. And my wife pretty much stole it from me. Looks like GM just can't seem to build something with out needing to recall it. </TEXT>

Not good prefomance when the Rav4 we traded in hadn't been touched in 60000miles.

<TEXT>I had admired the HHR for some time and finally took the plunge. It's a great car with everything you could want. Styling is exceptional, it's fun to drive, it's comfortable with great mileage. When I test drove the vehicle I have to admit I felt a bit claustrophobic what with the huge windshield pillars and dark tinted glass but soon got used to it. The large mirrors compensate quite well for any blind spots. My only complaints are the front brake rotors are too light for the car and front end needed work at 29,000 miles (which the dealer performed under warranty). Overall, I am thrilled with the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We looked at 7 cars in this class and liked the HHR best of all. What sold us. Well the styling was very appealing but the quiet ride, adequate power, nice interior layout with awesome cargo space and plenty of room in the back seats were the final selling pieces. We have over 4000 miles on this everyday work HHR and find it to be more that we expected. We live in the Northeast so one of the best features is the remote starting. Very nice to get into a warm car in these cold mornings. Getting 30 MPG is also very good. We are both over 50 so we will take the soft, quite ride over the stiff harder ride like the Masda 3 5 door had. The HHR fit and finish is also very impressive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the car now for almost 3 months and nearly 5k miles. I have 2LT 2.4L. It's a fun car to drive, for a car it's size does well on gas mileage, when I baby it I can get 27 mpg, when I drive more aggressive I can expect about 24.5 mpg. I have older parents and it's really easy for them to get in and out of the car without hitting their head on the way in, and it's a quite smooth ride. I helped a friend move and had plenty of room to haul stuff. The selling price of my HHR was 19.6k, for that price I have the 2LT package, heated leather seats, 6-CD changer, XM radio, and running boards (and some other additional trim). I don't think for that price you can do much better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Audio system! 6 CD changer, XM, 7- speaker Pioneer audio, and heated leather seats make this car truly a joy to drive every day. Ice cold AC, and remote starter, I live in Central Florida and it's nice to get cold AC cranked before you get to the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is great! I have always loved the retro look but it was not till I test drove one that I realized how great the car is! We have the 2.4L and it has some good get-up-and-go to it. We have the Leather and it is so comfortable! The interior has great styling. We moved recently and the cargo room was great when you lay the rear seats flat. The back of the seats are lined with Plastic just like the rest of the cargo area. The stereo is great with the 7 speaker Pioneer amplified system. The car is fun to drive and fun to show off to family and friends. Even if they do not like the way it looks, once they drive it they love it! We have the chrome package which adds some great styling!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned my 2LT for about 2 mos. now and am really impressed. The utility, the mpg, the drivability are everything I hoped they would be. The HHR's fun to drive, and stands out among the pack. I seem to attract attention and queries on a regular basis. As the first Chevy I've owned in almost 20 years, I was a little hesitant to buy, but I think GM at least on this vehicle has done an outstanding job on the little details, something that was not their strong suit in the past. Fit and finish on my black HHR is just beautiful; all the body parts are flush and exacting. I would definitely recommend this vehicle for purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We only just bought our HHR after trading in our Chrysler Town and Country Van which I was very attached to, but we no longer need a vehicle that size. I love the HHR, it is so comfortable and fun to drive. I love the interior and the way all the gauges are set up. I was going to go with a tiny car for better gas mileage but the HHR gives me a bit more room with a better gas mileage than my van. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the old body style and all the interior controls are very convenient once you get used to them. I really love that I have the buttons on the steering wheel to adjust sound and tracks for the Stereo. It is also very convenient that my back seats fold down in case I need to haul something.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only had the car three weeks but it has been great so far. Bought it for better mileage in my long commutes to work, so far it is averaging 28.5 in mixed, mostly highway driving (w/2.2 auto). Very comfortable ride, quiet out on the road. The interior is very functional. I have the 1LT in silver and it is everything I need and more...sunroof, Pioneer audio and XM (very nice sound), abs, traction control, curtain air bags. I like the looks with the roof rails, spoiler and running boards. I looked at many other options but this seemed far and away the most (and most versatile) car for the money. Loaded with little extras and niceties.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my HHR for less than 3 months and it has been in the shop for a total of a month and a half. It rattles squeeaks and shakes and the front end sounds like it is falling out from under it. DO NOT BUY ONE! Check out some of the forums on the internet. I sure wish I had before buying mine. Truly sad because the car looks good and I love the features. Hoping they will buy it back!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did an extensive research for the best wagon/suv that has 2.4L engine before buying our HHR. RAV4, Sportage, CRV, XB, Element, and Tucson beat the HHR in cargo capacity. But HHR beats them all in engine power, fuel mileage, and price. And HHR is also one of the CRs "Consumer Recommended" car. A loaded HHR for $22K like ours is a price that is hard to beat! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the HHR as a compromise - a fuel efficient commuter, comfortable trip car, roomy hauler and cool looking style-car. Handling with the 17 in wheels is adequate, though pickup is more station wagon than sedan. The arm rests covering the cup holders could be designed better. The window controls down low on the center console are no biggie, but then I owned a CRV for four years. The leather seats are very soft and comfortable for long trips. Chevy was dealing and I got a loaded up LT for under $20K. I have 10k miles on it so far, no defect issues and think it was a good buy for the money. The 100K power train warranty was also a factor here</TEXT>

<TEXT>So the wife is looking for a vehicle, wanted a Hyundai Sante Fe, I went to the dealership the day before and told the salesman, I guarantee when she sees he HHR, she will want this, as I am a Chevy man. Took the Hyundai for a spin, she was ready to sign, I told her, lets look at the HHR. I had not even started the engine yet, and she wanted this vehicle. Comfortable, all the goodies, roomy for passengers, just an all around great vehicle. I wish it came in a 6 cylinder, but that's neither here nor there. Seems to be a very reliable automobile that is comfortable and attracts a lot of attention in the Southern Ohio area. You don't see many here, but I have had many say they like it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've wanted one of these since I first saw in 2005. Finally bought it as a b-day present to myself--absolutely everything I dreamed it would be! Comfortable and fun. I am a Chevrolet-gal. It's black, chrome package, chrome wheels/roof rack/running boards, gray leather, heated seats, iPod PAL, remote start, premium mats, sunroof, etc. Was going to order 2008 blue HHR, but this was too loaded to pass up and a great deal. I have had so much fun driving it and love having folks ask me about it--and I've only had it a week! Highly recommend and look forward to many fun years of driving!</TEXT>

It has good all around visibilty and handles well in town as well as in the country. I like the way it hugs the road at 55 mph. It seems so solid. I don[t think of it as a "truck", more like a big car drive in a small package. It's very easy to get in and get out of too.</TEXT>

The 2.2L 4 cylinder has lots of ooomph when pulling out in traffic, accelerating uphill, or even when cruising at 70mph on the interstate. No complaints whatsoever! This is the most fun to drive car I've owned, and you've got to love the retro "gangster-car" look!</TEXT>

Liked the solid feel, styling and ride, 5 star crash ratings plus a nice list of standard features at a very good price. Very peppy for a 2.2L Auto, with smooth shifting that averages about 26MPG in stop and go commuter traffic. Close to 1K miles and my wife and I are very happy(she wanted one 1st). Will hopefully add a 2nd in a year or so. It was great to go out and look at cars and have a US made vehicle meet our needs and come out on top! So far so good! </TEXT>

If you like the Sunburst Orange but not sure of the color from the info it is a perfect color for this style of car and the pictures do not do it justice. It is more coppery when you actually get to see it. The black leather sure looks sharp in this color. It is nice to see a car with chrome on it again.

<TEXT>I purchased the HHR mainly for the looks and economy. It is quite adequate in both categories. Performance is a little suspect even with the big 4 cylinder engine and the premium fuel suggestion is absurd. It runs fine on mid grade or even regular. No pinging and no noticeable power loss. It is fun to drive and handles very well. The XM radio is great but the cup holders are not very good. I am still trying to figure out what that little light next to the sunroof controls is for. All in all I am very pleased with my purchase and coming from a Ram 1500 Quad Cab with hemi engine I love being able to drive by a gas station without stopping.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Shopped the PT Cruiser, Jeep Compass, etc. but this HHR was the obvious choice. Very fun car to drive. Gets double-takes out on the highway. Stick shift is fun to drive and has neat old style chrome shifter. Getting 30 to 34 mpg on the highway. Will carry 5 people comfortably or a bunch of cargo with seats folded down, up to 8' long. Very quiet and comfortable while driving. Lots of storage areas, although map pockets in door are not big enough. Base stereo is OK. Has features you would not expect for such an inexpensive car - cruise control, power windows, power programmable door locks (they lock and unlock automatically) , A/C, electromagnetic power steering, keyless entry and alarm, etc.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Old School hot rod styling; fantastic fuel mileage; super fun to drive (manual shifting is still pretty neat for some of us old folks). Very quiet and comfortable - soaks up the bumps easily. Doors close with a nice thump sound - surprising for a Chevy. Love all the gadgets like the "Info Center.."</FAVORITE>

Other than that the only other odd thing is the battery placement. What is up with that? I haven't even seen the battery yet. I hope all of the rear storage doesn't have to be removed to get to it. I am disabled and this would pose a problem for myself. Other than those small things, the SUV is great in every way.</TEXT>

Fun to drive, not as nimble as a MINI but awesome for under $16K. We like it so much that we are considering trading my wife's car for the special edition HHR or the Super Sport HHR. One huge complaint, I really believe everyone should complain about the $395 option for rear air bags! Crazy! Chevy should include this in every HHR. That would seal the deal.
