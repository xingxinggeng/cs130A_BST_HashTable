<TEXT>I personally own a Mazdaspeed3 hatchback and my wife enjoyed the sedan enough to want to get a sedan so we bought one. The interior on both is very nice and almost identical. My wife loves the look of this car and it is a very sport car with nice interior and looks on the outside. I had to add a rear wing to make it look sportier and upgraded my wife's interior lighting to LED's and upgraded her headlights to HID as well as upgraded the rims to 18-inch. The stock 16s are really ugly and too narrow so the fenders stuck out like crazy, adding wider and larger rims made a difference. Also the rearend is too high up so we had to install rear springs to drop the back down a bit to even it out.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the interior, looks almost the same as my Mazdaspeed3. The color choices for the sedan are awesome! We have Aurora Blue which is a beautiful color not available on the Mazdaspeed3 which really disappointed me that the MS3 had so few color choices. The sedan A looks great overall in and out!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased this car as a commuter: 90 miles round trip up the canyons. Power is great and gas mileage is amazing. We average 35mpg climbing 2500 feet to get back home. We looked at the Corolla and the civic and there was no comparison. We went with the Mazda because of reliability, power, and gas mileage. It is also a much better looking car. This is our second Mazda, we still own the first: a 1990 Miata with 100K miles on it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The 3 5-door Gran Touring is a solid, well put together vehicle that is fun to drive. As a suburban commuter, i get 23 MPH. The original Goodyear RSA tires were bad, only got 18,000 miles out of them, and they were terrible in bad weather. Put on slightly wider yokahama's that are terrific. This car is heavy, and a bit of a pig off the line, but at speed is handles well, accelerates well, and is comfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's quick when you need it, it looks like a sharp euro car, especially in White. I've driven 85k in the 2 years I've had it, not one problem except new tires, no surprise. When I use Mobil 1 5-20 and drive 55, I get 40 mpg! Can you show me another non-hybrid car at this price that performs like that? at under $14k, the 07 is perfect for anyone on a lower budget. The 2.3 engine is faster and offers more color choices, but you'll lose 5 mpg. The 2.0 is fast enough unless you have ego issues.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This has been one of the best cars I have owned. I live in small town Oregon so rarely ever see a freeway or a big city. Mostly I drive 60 mph between towns. My gas mileage is 30.5 around town and 36mpg when traveling. The manual tran is fast and fun to drive. I have had zero problems in the 2 years with only required service when needed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my first brand new car purchase and my first Mazda and I love this car. I thought the automatic transmission was trash so I got the manual. I get about 26 to 27 miles per gallon under mixed highway and city driving. I drive it pretty hard (I can't help it; it's fun to drive). I got rid of the whip antenna and replaced it with a Shark Fin Antenna and the car looks really nice with it. My friend says it looks almost like a BMW! The car looks REALLY nice in Black.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car, but would strongly recommend you get the manual transmission if you are after max fun. The automatic shift function is a joke. Off of the highway the 2.0L engine is almost just as fun and much better on gas, plus you can avoid those terrible 17" tires. 33K so far and nothing except basic maintainace and having to buy snow tires on steel rims and new street tires on the 17" rims. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The manual transmission is great. Also the hatchback utility is so convient and looks good too. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After years of driving a thirsty pig of a Nissan Maxima, I decided I wanted something smaller and more economical. The thing is I was not willing to give up the fun to drive factor. After looking at many different cars, I always came back to the Mazda 3. It provides by far the most fun in its price class. In the nearly three years I've owned this car, I've been very impressed with the overall performance and quality. The steering and handling in particular are outstanding providing nearly BMW style feedback. I love this car as you could probably tell by now. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a economical car but can't stand boring cars like the Toyota Corolla. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>As mentioned above, the steering and handling are superb. The 2.0L has decent power and torque. I also like the overall layout of the interior. My 6'3" frame fits well inside. The trunk is also a bit larger then one would expect. Mileage is good, about 27 MPG in mostly city/suburban driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall, it's a great car. No mechanical issues at 16,700 miles. It's got great pick-up and looks great. I get 27 mpg on the highway at 65-70 and I think that bites. I can get 37 out of my Focus. If I drive at 45 mph down the highway I can get to the 34 mpg range. The 17" Goodyear Eagle P** tires are about worn out. I'm really disappointed with them. Almost all my driving has been highway. They have a tread wear rating of 250. I'll be lucky to make it past the 20,000 mile mark without buying new ones. Had to upgrade to the Grand Touring trim at the last moment to get the side airbags. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks and performance. Cool car, goes when I need it to go. Smooth and responsive automatic transmission; LED lights and automatic windshield wipers are great. Cruise control is very functional and the radio controls on the steering wheel are great. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a driver oriented compact car, I've had a lot of fun driving it these 9 months but it sacrifices some comfort for handling. Exterior and interior styling is the best in the segment, it's a very sharp looking little car. The fuel economy needs to be worked on though, I'm only getting 20 MPG in the city, very disappointing. Also, there is a lot more hard plastic than the Civic, but it is put together very well. Even though the Civic has some advantages over the Mazda, I would still pick the 3.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my Mazda3 for about a month. I went and drove the new Hondas and the new Toyotas and did not even check out the American makes. For the price of the Mazda3, it out performs in acceleration, handling, braking and shifting. It is also more comfortable and just all around more enjoyable to drive. If you want a nice car that has a sexy design and drives well for a great price, then I suggest the Mazda3.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been driving my MT 3 for 8 mos. All in all, I'm satisfied, but there are some major engineering errors that they need to address. I added the Sirius radio after I got the car (bought through the dealer, but installed at an aftermarket), and by doing so, the aux button for my iPod no longer worked. Was told that it's either one or the other - after purchase of course. Complained enough to the dealer that they gave us a comp on the switch box needed to use both sat and aux. Claimed they didn't know. Don't pay $150 for a feature that should have been there from the start. I drive 95% highway and only average 26.2 after 8K miles. Was told would get 30+.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded an 06 Civic EX sedan, 5MT w/navi for the Mazda3. What does that tell you. :) The Mazda is a much more drivable car. A bit more comfortable and more pep. At a cost of worse gas mileage. Getting in and out of the car is easer. Lumbar support on the driver's seat is useful.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this vehicle for 3 months and feel that I can finally comment on it objectively. This is the most fun I've had owning and driving a car, ever. Super comfortable driver's seat. Love the sporty design and have been impressed with the handling. Very stable around turns and corners. Great acceleration when trying to merge or pass other vehicles. So much more power than my previous 2003 Nissan Sentra or my daughter's Toyota Corolla. The gas mileage could be improved upon - I'm currently averaging 26.4 mpg in the city and about 31 mpg on highway trips, but this could be attributed to the fact I've been running the air all summer. Also has the Bose sound system which is awesome.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought the S Grand Touring with a 5 speed. I love to drive it, want to go to eat at restaraunts that are farther away. I wish I lived farther from work. I had a Scion xB, which had a sporty feel, but the engine always sounded like it was laboring. The <azda's 2.3L engine seems to effortlessly propel the vehicle. I think this adds to its luxurious feel. Leather seats would not otherwise make up for a loudly revving engine. I love the trip computer, however, now I know just how bad the gas mileage is when I drive the car like it's in a "Zoom Zoom" commercial. I am getting about 26 MPG right now after a few days of driving mixed freeway and city. I expect 35ish on the road trips.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was reluctant to purchase the Mazda3 automatic, but after shopping for almost 3 weeks,and driving countless cars, I found my Mazda3. I love it, it handles awesomely, it is stylish, clean, the engine is sound, the stereo system is fantastic for such a small sedan but it is not small inside. I can fit 4 average sized people comfortly. The only problem I see thus far is the dashboard is a very dark brown, almost black, and I live in Florida, so it collects the heat and makes for a hot car until the air gets going full blast for a few minutes. I would defintely buy another Mazda!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car about 8 months now. There are lots of features my car has for the money. Tilt/telescoping steering wheel, HID manual leveling lights, auto wipers, leather, air bags all around the car. AC is powerful. Audio/cruise control on the steering wheel is convenient. The 2.3 shifts up well and holds onto gears when needed though downshifts are a little abrupt at low speeds. Gas mileage is only decent and was expecting more but can't really complain considering acceleration and how I drive. Car handles extremely well at low and high speeds. Steering is sharp and impressive, with very little float while the car stays composed over bumps. Brakes have good progressive feel.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auxiliary in: I can play tunes off my cell phone even though steering wheel controls don't work at the same time. Rain sensitive/auto wipers. Heated front seats. 8 cup holders (each door has one, 2 front, 2 rear). Large and deep glove box. HIDs provide very nice white and wide light.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I chose the Mazda3 over a Civic EX coupe because I was looking for performance, styling and versatility over mileage. After 2,000 miles, I'm finding all of that and more. This car is a pleasure to drive on long trips and short. Handling is superb and mileage has been excellent, generally getting 29-33 mpg. This car offers Honda quality with twice the styling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had my car now for 5 days and I am in love. It is always the nicest car in the parking lot when I am leaving my college. It is so smooth to drive and the automatic is fantastic with the option to put it in manual drive! I don't like all the red color for the radio but besides that it is everything I hoped for. It is not that roomy in the back but I don't care much because I rarely have people sitting back there anyways. The only worry I have is the cloth material they have for the seating. I saw a 2006 used Mazda whose seat fabric was coming apart because of the type of material it is. I just filled up my tank and I only got about 27.6 miles to the gallon which is a bummer. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The radio controls on the steering wheel. It is really cool when you turn the volume up or down and the lights light up on the right hand side or left hand side. All the cupholders everywhere is also very useful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Mazda3i sedan AT two months ago. It performs well, I'm only sorry I didn't choose manual transmission as the engine is very lively and car itself is light, so MT may give you better feeling of the car. But the AT performs smooth, is very responsive and very comfortable to ride. Being 6'2" means many of the cars just won't give you enough space. Only question I may have is the fuel economy. I do 1/2 hwy & 1/2 city with one passenger and after 2500 miles, I got not more than 26 mpg. I thought it would be more savvy on gas consumption.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. Especially w/ the manual transmission. I got heated leather seats, 6 disc in-dash Bose stereo, sun/moonroof that is sweet. I've got a 2.5 yr old, and a baby on the way. So I get the excellent sportiness, plus 4 doors, and a nice size trunk. The only poor thing about this car is the Goodyear Eagle RS-As that came on it. I won't complain about the size, but I'll never buy those tires again! I'm at 25,000 miles right now and the tires are almost bald. I drive fast, but not THAT fast! And the worst all-season traction EVER! Other than that, I love my car, and it's as much fun to ride in as to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>13.5 years with Samantha, Sam, my manual 5 Saab, left me looking for slick escapes from daring edgework, tires squealing but suspension reliable and hugging seats. Got 'em in the Mazda3: tightest turning at speed, I'm still discovering wide slow sweet sweeps; body's external angles impress, as internal fits tightly to my average sized frame. I love gloving my lats, glutes and knees into the sculpted driver's pit, then telescoping out and laying steering wheel in my lap. But, 3,333 miles in my hands, I prefer my Saab's H handles. Named "Bluey, because it's SO blue!" by my 7 y/o, the Mazda3 performance out-classes the clumsier Mazda6, impresses with pickup, quiet, and rail-like free-wheeling.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Suspension: supportive yet floaty; how does Mazda do that!?! Immediacy: stomp the gas, rocket out of jams; others willfully enter freeze-frame paces, tearing passages across three lanes to exit ramp. Phew!

<TEXT>I purchased the Mazda3 after reviewing the Civic and other similiar cars. Overall I considered the price, style and gas mileage. I drove the Speed and 5 Door Grand Touring 2.3 hatchback and chose the Mazda 2.3 Grand Touring due to price considerations. The car is great, I really like it and I have the Bose System with sunroof. However, after four months I think I should have gotten the Speed. Clutch is good, better with a shorter throw. Last note: I'm getting 27.3 mpg and traveling 80 mph on the freeway for a about 80 miles a day. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior style, sexy and unique. I liked the analog speedometer and tachometer, digital speedometers/tachometers stink. Interior is nice. I like the controls on the steering wheel. Leather good. Heated seats nice. Lights good. Galaxy Grey great. Bose nice. Info system great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is amazing. It's very fun to drive and I was very impressed with the performance of the car. Not to mention the gas mileage is amazing, I drove from San Bernardino to Yucaipa 3 times, around the streets, and I still had half a tank. It was full when I started. Sadly though, a drunk driver hit me head on going 40 miles and hour and the car saved my life. I walked out of the car with no injury, no whiplash, but a few sore spots from the air bag and seat belt. I got enough to buy the same car, and truthfully, I will buy it again for those reasons.</TEXT>

You feel like you spent in the 30 to 40 price range. Upscale interior compared to others in its class, great styling was also a key in our purchase.

I wanted one a couple of years ago when they first came out but bought something else instead. I am glad I finally own one. This thing flies and handles for its size and price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power is good and better now that I have made engine and exhaust modifications. The lines of the car along with the rear end of the hatch are awesome. It is just fun to drive and even more fun to just look at. Steering wheel controls are a big commodity.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought a black GT Mazda3 and it sure looks beautiful. The packages included in it like the bose and moonroof make it really worth the price. The interior with leather looks very slick. I get 27-28 mpg. Overall it is a good choice for a cost effective sedan with features. No other car will give you traction control and stability control at this price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good handling, of course the looks, the bose speakers are worth adding the sound package.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Steering wheel feels great to grip. Does not feel like a front wheel drive car. Manual shifter is not only slick but has good insulation, almost no noise or vibration! 2.3L engine is smooth and powerful but gas mileage is not good, about 24 mpg (combined driving). Pretty roomy inside for a small car. Not much room for driver's feet, gas pedal and brake pedal are too close together. (This is with manual trans.) Standard single disc CD stereo sounds great, better than that in my '06 Lexus GS 300! Horn is too weak, a safety concern! Most unexpected: I still CRAVE to drive it, although I have been driving for 35 years and have sampled over 10,000 cars as a mechanic!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling and long list of standard equipment on the hatchback that are of good quality and work good. Made in Japan and priced right (although I would still buy it if it cost a few thousands more).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great driving machine but hard to find a manual. 07 Civic and 07 Corolla have nowhere near the road manners and performance of this one. Smooth and quiet ride but with excellent feel of the road. Acceleration is quite spirited and the quiet cabin belies the speed you are driving at. Braking is amazing! Only car with stability control at this price level. In mixed driving around Seattle I get 400 miles per tank. The hatch has ample cargo volume for hauling. Very easy to attach baby seats with the latch system. Driving at night, with the fog lights on, is a pleasure for tired eyes. The illuminated buttons (audio and cruise) on the steering wheel take a bit of getting used to. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Huge glove compartment! Clear and lively sound from the in-dash 6 CD set. Driving with an open moonroof does not generate much noise. Butter smooth manual shifter. Great trunk and under-trunk space utilization. Many small item storage spots. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is by far the best car in its price range. It feels like a car costing several $K more. No comparison with so-called competitors like Corolla, Cobalt, Caliber, etc. (Maybe a Civic comes close.) The Mazda3 just does not feel like a small car. The 2.0 engine is more than adequate, reasonably quiet and zippy. I saw no reason to go the 2.3 for extra dollars. Handling is great, goes where you tell it to go. Brakes inspire confidence. Basic stereo is quite good. (I wanted the upgrade, but would have to have taken moonroof and other gimmicks.) Styling is fabulous, sporty but not too much so. Mileage is as advertised, but certainly no better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I debated for over a year before I finally bought one and I couldn't be happier. I bought it in November, but only started driving it regularly after selling my old car about 2 months ago. So far, it's been a great little car. It's an Aurora Blue GT loaded with Bose, moonroof, 6CD, 5-spd AT, and Homelink autodim mirror. I so look forward to driving my car, even though gas prices are outrageous.</TEXT>

The interior looks way better than any other cars in this class, and the exterior is really good looking, sporty is the word I would use. I get about 32 mpg. The handling is amazing! Just ignore the signs that say 35 around a corner, go 55! Overall, I am very, very happy with my purchase!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looks cool, handles great, great mpg, got all kinds of options for a cheap price, pretty good giddy-up and go. Really love the dash lighting - that blue to bright red makes me feel like I am in a space ship. The pump up/down driver's seat is nice, I am nearly 6' tall and I can easily lower it and feel perfectly comfortable in it while my 5'2'' wife can do the same. The 6 cd stereo rocks pretty good for being just factory. It is also a head turner. We got a spoiler too and that just adds to its over all appeal. I just cannot say enough good things about it, wish I could get another so we can have 2 and I could drive it full time. Sometimes I like to look out the window and gaze at our ''zoom-zoom".</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car gives amazing performance for the price. Quiet, extremely smooth engine and tranny, firm brakes, great ride. It handles like it's on rails. Rides/performs like a car costing 5-10 thousand more. For ca. $1800 and a couple bucks more per month on a payment, it is stupid not to get the Grand Touring model. Just the xenon headlights are worth it. Once you have driven a car with xenons, you'll think normal headlights are pure junk. The leather, auto-on headlights and wipers are nice too. So get the Grand Touring!! We test drove all the popular cars, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, etc., and none of them held a candle to this car as far as equipment and performance for the price. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride, handling, brakes, quiet, tight chassis, equipment for the price, a $20xxx with xenons!! My gripes notwithstanding, I would buy this car again given that you simply cannot buy another $20k car with this kind of chassis and I'll take the chassis over a foo-foo interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After being disappointed by the arrival of a few new "super cars", my wife steered me toward Mazda. Not since I drove my first sports car at 18 - a long time ago - have I taken so much to a car. The drive position, steering feel, throttle/steering coordination and world class brakes were all something from the "Sorceror's Apprentice". And the glove box is more the size of a small suitcase; you can actually store stuff. In short, although I was considering Japanese and German sports sedans at almost twice the price, this car put an end to that insanity. Why not spend half the money for same dose of fun - plus the bonus of made in Japan build quality. I did - not so stupid after all.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far the car has been wonderful. Handling is magnificent, very little body lean, the car sticks right to the road in cornering. The traction control is great in the rain on wet roads. Road noise is a little loud compared to other cars I've had, especially on the highways, but not a major problem for me. Overall, I think it's a fun little car to drive. So far, it's a keeper.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The auto dim rear view mirror is wonderful at night. Especially when SUVs and bright headlights are behind, it really helps save your eyes from the glare.

<TEXT>This car is a total ZOOM-ZOOM ride and buy. I test drove many cars and found this one to be the very best for the value and safety. This sedan falls in the class of a higher model, even with heated seats. I am so impressed with all the options, and especailly the look and style of the car. My wife loves the interior of this car, especially at night. Sweet instrumental colors. This car is built well from Japan and is a "J" car. You can not beat the price, options and features. You can't beat the feel, drive and stablity of this Mazda 3 S Grand Touring. I am more than happy with this car. I have added all the accessories that I could get with this car. I have added: bra, wheel locks, 6 CD Bose system, moonroof, all weather floor mats, cargo mat, compass/autodim mirror with Homelink, rear lid spoiler and the cool intake unit. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When I first saw this car for the price, I said NO WAY!! How can Mazda sell a car that is 100% made in Japan with all these options for this low price? This car rates like a higher end car with all these options and heated seats!!! I am blown away of what you get for the price. A car like this in this class would be over $28,000. I test drove this car twice and totally fell in love with it. My wife even loves the colors (instrumental panel) at night. I agree this car beats most. I bought the Mazda3 S Grand Touring fully loaded. Awesome!! I got all the options that were avaliable. I would highly recommend adding the cool air intake unit, the front mask, wheel locks, cargo mat, seat covers, front and rear dash covers, all weather carpet mats, rear lip spoiler, and of course the Bose 6 CD changer that is built into the dash. Just simply awesome!! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything!! I love the Bose 6 CD, moonroof, seats, ABS, etc, cup holders, heated seats, tilt and telescopic steering wheel, AC is so cold that I can't use it above level 2.

<TEXT>This vehicle is such a safe vehicle! I lost control of this vehicle on a windy and bumpy road. It rolled at least four times. The passenger compartment was for the most part intact! It protected me and my other 2 occupants. Cops say that we should be all dead. But thank goodness I had chosen a very safe vehicle! So I would personally recommend this vehicle due to its fun to driveness, its safety, and its handling. This vehicle had so many memories in it. You will create so many. You will absolutely love to drive this vehicle so you get your moneys worth out of it. I would say buy this vehicle for sure! I miss this car even though I now have a Mazda6 S Grand Touring Sedan.

<TEXT>I bought my brand new Mazda3 S GT in Black. First off, there were 2 chips in the hood that went down to the bare metal. They replaced the hood which I am thankful for. Today, while cleaning my vehicle I noticed a rock chip on my windshield the size of a pin head. Great car, but it seems to be easily prone to rock chips. I had a 99 Camry, and had many rocks hit my windshield, and never a chip. Now I have to pay 60 dollars to have the chip filled with no guarantee that it will last. I hope Mazda strengthens their windshields on future models, but overall this is a classy little car with a BMW 3 series look to it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The good parts: Smooth shifting, and clutch action that is really nice. I was worried about the light clutch action before I drove it, but it really engages nice. Solid feeling car. Tight handling, and still an ample amount of boost on the power steering. Sometimes smaller cars have been reducing the amount of power steering boost so much it?s hard to tell they even have it. Nice to see all 07 Mazdas have an audio in jack for your iPod. Sure, it just sends a non-intelligent audio signal, but hey, it?s better than nothing. Great styling. Vanity stinks, but I have to say that in this case, I?m sure glad I went with the best looking car in its class. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned my Mazda 3 i-touring (2.0 cylinder 5M) for about 5 months now and I think I can give an honest review having used it for ALL purposes. I initially used it to commute daily (120 mile round trip) and it was SUPERB. Great mileage, fun drive, good turn radius. My one complaint was perhaps road-noise on the highway and the stereo is a little tinny. Next I drove it long haul from Northern WA state to Southern CA loaded with luggage. While I did fine maintaining highway speed, I got bad mileage and the car rode HARD. Also, I was very uncomfortable no matter how I adjusted the seat. It has done great in SOCAL. Recommend: Use for city and commutes - avoid full passenger load - rides hard when full.</TEXT>

But the moment I got in and started the engine I felt a connection I hadn't with any of the other cars. It just felt...good. Taking it for a drive confirmed that -- it runs as good as it looks. Quick and fantastic handling. The car has nearly zero body roll around corners. The steering is extremely tight and responsive.

I went with the Mazda3 s Touring Wagon for room and the addition of the side curtain airbags, but was surprised by all the little standard features: MP3 input, storage trays under panels in the back, and cupholders everywhere. I bought the car and immediately took a 1,200 mile road trip and it ran great, although the gas mileage came in a little lower than I had hoped (27 mpg), but that might more due to my driving style.

<TEXT>Forget Civic, Corolla, even an Accord 4 banger. Buy a Mazda 3. This is the 2nd one I've owned, and it's great. Great option packages, good engine, with outstanding reliability. This car has features that cars in the $30k range don't have i.e. leveling headlights, leather seating, heated seats, mp3 output, navigation. All of these are available, and at a great price. Now for the engine, lots of "Zoom- Zoom", but go for the 5 speed manual-lots of fun. The only thing I don't care for are the tires that come at standard equipment. These Goodyears stink, but when they wear in 15k, I'm going for the Michelin's. I had 'em on the last one and they are great in all weather. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated leather seats, on board computer, and rear cup holders are my favorite features. I can't complain about the 6 disk in dash CD changer with iPod jack either. To summarize- BUY THIS CAR!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've liked this model since it was the Protege5 and circumstances finally got around to where I bought a Mazda3 last week. I actually prefer the exterior of the P5 to that of the Mazda3 but the interior is a huge improvement (bye-bye econo-car.) My car has True Red paint with a black leather interior, 5 speed and moonroof/CD package. I also looked at the VW GTI, Passat wagon and Audi A3 and just couldn't justify spending the extra money on German "engineering." Sorry, the domestic competition was just too underwhelming to consider. The car is not perfect (see suggested improvements) but the positives FAR outweigh the negatives. MPG is 20 with all-city driving and a cherry motor.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior features--audio controls on steering wheel, cool dash lighting, iPod aux, lots more; quick steering; stiff yet still pliant suspension; decent 4 cylinder engine; very comfortable seats; good shifter; great value. This car is a ton of fun to drive (and I'm still breaking in the engine.) </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I researched for several months beginning with a Caliber, then a Vibe, and a Matrix, before I finally found the Mazda 3, which had better reviews than all of these other cars and the Honda as well. I am extremely pleased with my purchase. Mine is True Red with black leather interior and I love it. I was previously driving an Intrepid which I loved. My wife now drives the Intrepid and I am blessed to drive my new Mazda. It drives so much better than the Intrepid (which really does drive well, just not as good as the Mazda) and is very peppy. I would definitely recommend that you buy this car if you are looking for something with good MPG, but also with a little power. I love this car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather seats, moonroof, radio buttons on steering wheel, just to name a few. also the exterior really looks great - a lot better than the Matrix, Vibe, or Caliber. The steering is awesome and very responsive. Cargo room is pretty big for such a small car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The ultimate factor that made me choose the Mazda3 over the Civic was the hatchback utility and cuteness factor. I love the small and zippy feel of the car. Good size for me and not many people in my area have a Mazda3 so it's nice to be different on the road. The telescoping and tilting steering wheel is nice. As is the lumbar support. I didn't upgrade my audio nor have a sunroof, so it's basic but definitely fun to drive.</TEXT>

For almost a year, I had been searching for something in the small car class that wasn't just gonna blend into the crowd. While at the same time, offering near best in class quality, performance, and handling. I believe I've found that car in the Mazda3s Grand Touring 5-door. Mazda deserves accolades for pushing the bar higher in a segment that usually inspires boredom. Keep up the good work Mazda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Mazda has earned its reputation. This is a fun to drive "pocket rocket". The 2.3L engine has the get-up & go of a sports car, and the car handles to match it. I typically drive it at 80 mph on the highway every day, and get 28 - 30 mpg depending on how much I drive it in town. When I had to make a 2000 mile trip recently, I easily chose this to drive rather than my SUV, and did not regret it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A very nice car, and a great value for the money. It has excellent acceleration and handling, and the shifter is a blast through the gears. I tried the Civic, Elantra, and Sentra, but the Mazda3 was just more fun. I also like the black interior with red gauges. It makes the driver's seat look like a fighter cockpit. There's enough room for four in a pinch, and the trunk is big enough to fit all of my stuff, too. My gas mileage has been about 26 mpg in mostly city driving, which is so-so compared to cars like the Civic, but good enough for me. If I wanted to save the planet I would have bought a Prius.</TEXT>

One thing I hadn't planned on was how nice looking the car is. Mine is red, and people constantly comment on how nice the car looks. It has a nice stance and good lines. I'm a fairly big guy, and I fit into the car easily. The seats slide very far back and there is a lot of headroom. I strongly recommend this car to anyone in the market for a smaller car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car! I've been extremely pleased with it. It runs very smoothly and is fun to drive. For me the suspension is perfect, it's not too soft, so you can feel the road, but soft enough that the ride is still smooth. I love the speedometer display, the layout of the thermostat and the audio controls (note: the Grand Touring thermostat controls are different than the lower models). The fuel economy isn't the best, but you get a peppy engine in return. This car offers a lot of features that you wouldn't expect in an economy car. I think the Mazda3 is a great car and I have no regrets about my purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is downright fun to drive whether it's long distance or a trip to the grocery store. The 2.3L engine packs enough punch to warrant the zoom- zoom label. Handles great. The exterior is superior to any vehicle in this class. Exchange the Mazda labels for BMW, and people would believe you. Interior styling is beautiful, especially for the price. Aux input jacks prevents burning a million CDs. Nothing against Civic, it's a great car, but everyone has one. They are a dime a dozen. Go for the Mazda3 if you want an athletic and affordable car that stands out on a road crowded with "blah" economy sedans.</TEXT>

I really wanted the aurora (bright) blue, which is only available in the s packages. The interior features are amazing, especially the steering wheel controls for the audio system. Air conditioning works great driving around in hot Florida weather. Before my friends were embarrassed to ride in my 1996 Mercury Cougar, but now they all ask me for rides in the 3. On the night the Florida Gators won the national championship, I actually drove 6 people in it (2 in the front, 4 in the back) and nobody complained about being cramped. Wow!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my Mazda 3 about 3 months ago and I will give you guys a full feedback. 2 months later, I got rear-ended on I95 at 70 mph by a SUV and I'm ok. The trunk is crushed and rear window is shattered. Overall, this showed me that the car is extremely safe. I must say that out of most sedans out there, this is probably the safest car out there. The airbag DID NOT pop, so not sure if that's a good thing? PROS - Got the car for $24k with Nav + 6 cds + moonroof. Takes 87 octane gas (yay!). 18" rim a plus. Spacious trunk. CONS - Fairly noisy engine. Expect a bumpy ride - cheap suspension. I know it's the Mazda3 (not 6) - don't expect a lot of backseat room.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Slick interior / design. Sweet leather seats. Heated seats a bonus! Tons of cup holders (8 total). HUGE glove compartment (can fit a laptop). Colorful odometer / speedometer. Aux plug is hidden in the center console for my iPod. Moonroof + sunroof - easily accessible. Decent (only ok) 22 mpg city.</FAVORITE>

I have the Mazda3 s sport (black w/ black interior and spoiler) and love its style and look. (get many compliments from friends and strangers). The ride is extremely smooth and it has great acceleration and speed. I would recommend getting a radar detector to alert you and remind you to look at the speedometer because it's easy to lose track of your speed. ZOOM ZOOM! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The speedometer display, after starting the ignition it lights up fire-red (looks really nice with the blue background when the headlights are on).

<TEXT>We were ready to buy a dowdy subcompact before driving the Mazda3. After the drive, there was no question. This car is a well styled road rocket and instantly changed our top priority from mpg to fun. After a couple fill-ups I'm averaging a respectable 28 mpg, a bit less than I'd been in the market for, but enough to stay true to the spirit of an affordable, reliable, low total-cost-of-ownership purchase. It's more than large enough for everyday driving for our family of 4. And, again, the performance is just awesome -- quick, nimble, and amazingly grippy. Bottom line: try it, you'll like it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have not had my 3 for that long, but I have not found anything to complain about. It's an upgrade from what I had before. The steering and braking are tight. I previously had an 03' Protege so it has similar handling, but the ride is firmer and smoother. It has more power, but I could still use a little more. Living in a big city you need to be able to accelerate fast when traffic pushes you to, and 0-60 in 9 seconds is a little under par for what I expected. All the interior amenities are nice, must of which I had in the Protege, but way more stylish. Also the four wheel ABS brakes, and side impact airbags are a nice comfort. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the interior and exterior design. It is very comforting and high quality for the money. The interior lights and sound system are great. The exterior is classy yet bold and aggressive. The 3 has so many options that you can have all the features of a luxury car.</FAVORITE>

Handles great, fairly smooth ride, even for Michigan roads. The mileage seems to be pretty good, though I've only checked it once (only filled up once).

<TEXT>This is my second Mazda3. I've looked at every compact car under $20K, and the 3 is the best for the money. It has the best performance numbers, features and driving ability. Not to mention the build quality-It's a hair below entry-level German cars, so about the same as a good Volkswagen. From the '06 model, the best improvements are traction control and the auxiliary input jack. Otherwise the car is pretty much the same, and that's a good thing. I have a few minor quibbles: The dash is plain without sat-nav and is prone to attracting dust very quickly and the pedal placement is a bit off (brake and gas too close together). But don't worry, the car can take corners like a true sports car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For the money, you won't find a better driving hatchback out there (minus the Mazdaspeed3, GTI, STI, etc. of course). Typical Mazda steering, powerful brakes, and fantastic grip. If the aforementioned are more important to you than mpg, the Maz3 is definitely worth a look. Fuel economy is ok, but certainly not great for a compact, as has been said by many others. Driving from CA to NY (all interstate with speeds around 75-80), I averaged around 30 mpg. A typical tank with mixed city and hwy driving will yield 22-26 mpg. For those who cannot see their gauges in daylight, you need to push that little button on the instrument cluster to alternate your dash lighting - there are two modes</TEXT>

The car is very smooth to ride and handle. The 17" alloy wheels that come with S Touring provide an added coolness to the car. The interiors are extremely good and can rival that of any luxury car. The fuel efficiency is also good for a 2.3L engine. This is a great car if you are looking for an alternative for Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla. Looks better than its competitors, is more powerful and provides nearly the same fuel efficiency.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased my Mazda3 Grand Touring wagon less than two weeks ago. I traded in a full sized 2004 Ford truck, and could not be happier! The truck was loaded out, so I decided to get this car the same way, only left out the navigation. What a fun car to drive! All the comforts you you would need, or want in a car. It handles great, runs fantastic, and has decent fuel mileage as well. The first tank average for me was 26 on the nose. It did show to get as much as 33 per gal on straight hwy use. I think Mazda has a definite "Bang for the Buck" in the car.,.style, comfort, and performance in a nice little package. I was able to get all this for under $22k. Not bad!</TEXT>

We also looked at the new Rabbit but it had no real "fun factor". The Mazda 3 handles fantastic and the high revving engine makes the car feel faster than the speedometer is indicating. Curves and turns in the "3" are very tight and the car feels more like a BMW 3 series than a $20k sedan. In my opinion you will not find a better sedan with sporty characteristics than the Mazda 3.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall style. Peppy 2.3l 4 cylinder engine. Loads of standard features. Great exterior style. Good head room and leg room in all seats (I am 6'4).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Mazada3 and have enjoyed the comfort and fun style of this little car. I get compliments on it, people refer to it like a little BMW. The fuel economy is great-I have driven over 260 miles on a 1/2 tank of gas, and average 100 miles every 1/4th tank in the city. The car has very little noise and is a smooth ride. The braking system is great once you begin to wear them in. Very safe car with 6 air bags and security system. Trunk is very roomy for the size of the car. I was able to fit two of my guy friends, one at 6'4 and the other at 6'2, on the passenger side of the car and they both had good leg room. The moon roof and 5 changer package is worth the money. Awesome car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features about the car is the convenience of the cruise control and radio controls being on the steering wheel. I also like the foglights and the console lights contrasting red and blue. The car has a very sporty feel and look even though it is classified as a sedan. Huge glove compartment.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wow, the driving performance is amazing. I loved my old cars ('86 Mazda RX-7 and '99 Subaru Impreza Outback wagon), but I really, really love my Mazda 3. I get at least 35 mpg highway. The clutch is so smooth. The steering and handling is that of a fine tuned luxury car. The acceleration, especially at higher speeds, is very impressive for a 2.0L. Many neat interior design features. If you love driving, but want something economical, look no further. If you want a small luxury car, get it fully loaded and enjoy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Drove a Mazda3 two years ago and my wife and I were blown away at the performance for the money. Our 14 year old Protege finally died and we considered the Rabbit and Mercury Milan. Drove the 3 again, and were struck again at the strong handling, decent torque, nice design, and safety features. This thing really handles well for an inexpensive front wheel drive car. If you don't want to spend the money for a 3 series, G Sedan, or even a Jetta GLI, the 3 provides a great fix. We took the sunroof package and the striking Phantom Blue color--which looks nothing like the web photo. Hopefully it will age well, because we're keepin' this baby! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering and handling! Smooth, fairly torquey engine, very nice packaging and design. Sunroof a must, and MP3 support adds flexibility. The re-design for '07 makes the car less sporty, but more sophisticated. It's a looker that walks the walk. </FAVORITE>

After taking it for a test drive, I knew I had made a right choice in purchasing the 3. The list of features in the fully loaded GT is something you would normally find in cars retailing for more than $30K. I got mine in true red and it looks great. The engine is quick for a car in this class. Not the old 4 bangers of the past. Overall just a fun car to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm going to be honest and tell you I had to replace the fuel pump two days after buying this car. I'm calling it a fluke. Aside from that, this car rocks. I've been researching this one since it first came out, and now that I have it, it's everything I could want in a car. It came down to this or the Honda Accord, but this car has so much more passion. I know it's an economy car, but seriously, this is the closest thing to a BMW 3 series that I've driven this side of 25 grand. It's really that good. The engine is super smooth and powerful. The suspension is perfect, and the layout and design of the car is spot on. Buy this car. It's even better than you're hoping it will be. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Fun to drive! This car corners like it's on rails. Hugs the road with little to no body lean. Compared this with Honda, Toyota, and American counterparts and this one was the most fun to drive with great build quality. Lives up to the "zoom zoom" motto. Drives like a car in a higher class. After 1k miles, 22.3 MPG (80% city driving), but I'm a lead foot anyway. This trim comes with great safety features (ABS, side airbags, dynamic stability control). The ride may be too stiff for some. For the money, skip the factory navigation. If you're considering a car in this class, give this one a test drive; you'll be glad you did.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched for 3 months which car would be the best value for my budget and I am so glad I did. The Mazda 3i Touring is everything I expected in regards to value, what I didn't anticipate was how much fun it would be! I commute 98 miles round trip to work and you would think that driving would be the last thing that I would want to do for entertainment--HOWEVER-- this car changed all that for me. I have rediscovered my joy of driving and my family fights me for the keys. I am getting on average around 500 miles per tank of gas which makes driving for fun even more inviting, not to mention the surprising power--this thing drives like a sports car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for 2 months and a little over 4k miles and I am like a little kid every time I get to drive somewhere, even work. I wanted a GTI, but it was a little too pricey; tried the Rabbit, and was disappointed after the GTI. Found a wonderful compromise in the 3 that gave me a solid, beautiful car with zoom zoom, and a better reliability record. I have since driven a Civic EX and am I ever glad I got the Mazda. Available power is not over the top, but is more than adequate for spirited driving. The gas mileage suffers when you zoom, and it?s worth it. I love to drive and this car feeds that desire. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It was time to trade in the Infinity. My wife wanted a smaller car with better gas mileage, but still wanted all the goodies. We looked hard the the Infinity g35 and M series. We drove Acura, Toyota, Lexus and BMW's. The Mazda dealership was next door to the BMW's. Just for the heck of it, we took a looksee. She saw a Mazda3 and asked for a test drive. The smile on her face was priceless. I cannot tell you how much fun this car is to drive. It didn't have all the amenities compared to the luxury cars, but it had enough. I could not believe it was under $20K. It drives and handles like a dream. I drive it whenever she let's me. By the way, we are in our early fifties! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just recently purchased a brand new M3iT, and I must say, I have only one thing that wish was different with the car - a remote trunk release on the fob. Handling is amazing, with the independent rear end, and the variable power assist steering never has it been so fun to make to U-turns! The 2.0 is quick and responsive even when paired with the AT. The auto stick makes normal runs to the store much more enjoyable, and the trunk is very spacious whatever you may have (60/40 rear seat too). The front seats are adjustable in a few ways. The lumbar support, height, reclining, and the telescopic steering wheel makes sure your comfortable in any position.</TEXT>

I also bought the car because of the safety equipment. The real reason I bought this car is the looks for the money. The dynamic stability control I think saved me once when I swerved to miss something on the highway and overreacted. I turned the wheel way too much and then corrected to go straight again. My last car was a Park Avenue and it would have gone out of control for sure, not that I am knocking the Park Avenue. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After 4 years with an Audi A-4, needed something more reliable (it had major, constant repairs) and economical, that was close to the pep, style and quality of the Audi. Found it in the Mazda 3s! Looked at the 2006 models, but didn't like interior fabrics so waited for 2007 models. Grey fabric is perfect. Over 600 miles so far, and love it. Rides great, plenty of zoom power, over 30 MPG, seats VERY comfortable, controls well designed, and surprisingly quiet despite prior 2006 reviews of "road noise". Audio sound system excellent, tight turning ratio, and easy to handle. Overall, a great ride and great value. Consumer Guide reports a long, trouble-free car life. Hope so. Perfect.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just traded in my 2006 Tacoma for the Mazda3. Wow. What a ride. The performance and handling of this car put it so far ahead of the others in the class (can you hear me Honda, Toyota, Ford, etc?). Mine's brand new, but I'm already averaging 31 mpg. It is such a blast to drive, and surprisingly roomy inside considering how small it looks. When you first sit in this car, you feel like you're in a more expensive class of vehicle. Everything is rock-solid and extremely well put together. Just simply a joy to drive and own. If a small economical car is on your wish list, you'd be doing yourself a great disservice to not at least look at the Mazda3.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling and performance, the base 4 cyl. engine is fine for quick starts, the brakes are great for quick stops! The stereo sounds great for a stock system.

<TEXT>I had a 2004 Mazda3, which was fun and trouble free until it was totaled by an incompetent idiot. The resale value was such that I got $2k less than I'd paid 2 years before! I value the driving experience and reliability, and for replacement narrowed it down to this or the Civic, but after a drive there was no contest. Unlike the Civic, the controls are perfectly positioned and weighted, the handling is superb, power is good, gearbox is short-throw, precise, pleasant. It looks good, and is well equipped. Love the small leather steering wheel, shame the gearstick is no longer leather. Improvements for 2007 are slightly more refined suspension, stiffer chassis, mp3 input jack.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Mazda. I admit that much of my decision was driven by what I have read on Edmunds and other car review sites. That being said, I can find little fault this persistently fun car. At 6'2" I was unnecessarily worried about room; there's plenty for myself and my family of four. It handles like it's on rails, and its spirited engine is quite responsive. The mileage could be better, but given the engine's performance, it's a trade-off I can live with. Everything about this car screams 'attention to detail.' Mazda has a real winner here.</TEXT>

Smooth on the road, and living in NYC I have to deal with the constant potholes, but in this car they feel like a hump in the road and nothing more.

<TEXT>Maybe I'm the industry's worst nightmare. Their strategy is to get people to move UP the price/prestige ladder, not down. As a cash buyer I cross shopped G35, IS250, 325i because they should have been my next "step" from a current Maxima. Those cars are certainly nicer than the 3 in some ways but definitely NOT $15-20K nicer. It is well balanced, composed, and offers a great compromise between ride and "connectedness". The ergonomics are intuitive and controls are well placed. Throttle response with the 5A is better than any other 4 cylinder/auto combination I can recall. This is an honest vehicle not trying to masquerade as something it isn't. Well done Mazda!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded my 04 Mitsu Outlander because insurance premiums went up too high. Oddly enough, buying this new Mazda actually lowered my rates. First off, dealer tells me I'll be lucky to get 22 to 25 mpg. Just filled it up -- it got 33.75 mpg in combined city and highway. Not bad, and about 4 mpg better than the Mitsu. Runs like a scalded puppy and has no squeaks, moans or rattles. Looks sharp and others admire its shape (it's a Volvo S40 with $10K off the price). Now comes with 6 airbags, EBD, ABS and whatever other acronym you can think of. Also comes standard with a tire pressure monitoring system. Not enough space here to continue!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was a toss-up between the 06/07 Civic and the 3. In the end the Mazda 3's suspension broke the tie. The sporty handling and smooth ride was on Mazda's side. The Civic felt a tad bumpy. For a 2.0 the car can move paired with the 4 speed sport-shifting automatic. My wife commutes with the car about 160 miles a week so the gas savings was what opened us up to the car, yeah the Civic got 40 but really, no comparison between the 2 for handling.

<TEXT>Overall, a great balance between fun driving and economy. MPG seems closely tied to temperature - I got as low as 25 mpg last winter w/ mostly city driving, but had it up as high as 35 mpg in the summer, even w/ AC on. The steering is a little looser than I'd like, but handling is sharp, otherwise. Road/engine noise actually aren't bad - it's a *sporty* car, folks. Back seat is apparently comfy enough for my friends to fall asleep in it on a 3-hour trip. Interior was a little squeaky for the first several months, but that seems to have gone away. Better in the snow than I expected w/ this kind of HP. Engine is way forward of front axle - I suspect to deal w/ torque steering.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good at squeezing out both HP and MPG. = fun *and* cheap to drive! Red/purple dash lights make me feel like I'm driving a space ship. Nice styling. Good comfort. Excellent stereo & cruise controls on steering wheel. Boyfriend giggles gleefully when zipping out of driveway.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've now owned this car for two years now and it's been phenomenal. It's very fun to drive with a sporty suspension, pretty powerful motor and very smooth trans. To top that off I get 28 mpg in the summer and 26 mpg in the winter the reason comes with the different gas formulas. I have not had ONE reliability issue yet (knock on wood). It has very comfortable seats, but is definitely not a luxury car. It has a decent amount of road noise, and is a lil harsh on bumps. When you get nice roads to drive on road noise is a lot lower and the handling aspects of this car come out. If you?re willing to sacrifice a smooth ride for some sporty handling I would recommend this car to anyone!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had wanted this car from the instant Mazda unveiled it. I love small sporty sedans. I researched cars for four solid years before confirming that this is the one I wanted. Almost two years of ownership and I'm still in love with this car! I think it's one of the most underestimated cars on the road today. It doesn't belong in the economy class, it needs to be bumped up somewhere well north of the land of Focus and Cobalt, but just south of entry-levels from Acura, BMW, and Audi. It rides perfectly, it handles great, it looks beautiful inside and out. The engine is faster than many V6s I've driven. I've had zero problems with it. I'm VERY happy with it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The amenities like the heated seats, Bose stereo, moonroof, and xenon are great, but more than those I really love the way this car drives. It feels expensive, the ride is a good balance between firm and comfortable, handles great, very similar to an 04 BMW 3 Series I spent some time with.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Very good handling, good mpg for a compact, very good power, lot's of features for money, ride below avg. Even for a compact also not very quiet even for a compact, had it back in for at least 2 events. Remote start and engine lite was on 4 days while I waited for an appointment. Could not drive it for fear of breaking down out of town or in bad place. Messed up 4 day week end.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Slow, very unresponsive engine below 4K. The 2.0 liter in my RSX Type S feels much stronger than the 2.3 in this. Handling is good when driven at 7 tenths, but gets sloppy when pushed to the limits. Very long list of features, but quality is extremely disappointing:driver's seat squeaks badly (driver is 100 lbs), dash rattles horribly, driver's side window slams into frame when rolling up and rear left door vibrates badly when opened and is extremely hard to shut. I now know why Mazda offers so many things on this car; it's b/c they cannot match Honda and/or Toyota in terms of quality and refinement. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched various cars over a year ago before my purchase, and online reviews were a large part of it. To return the favour, I'll write about my Mazda 3 5-door. Everything about it is great. My boyfriend has an Avalanche and can barely afford to drive it, but my car, even with the high gas prices, is $45 every 2 weeks. And I drive home at lunch every day. The back seats fold down so my 2 large dogs can fit in the back without destruction, and with the hatchback I just lift up the trunk to let them jump in. I hesitated to get the fit, scion a & versa as they were puny. This car has some guts but is sporty and versatile at the same time. Cheers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for almost a year and have enjoyed it very much. It is very comfortable and stylish and is a pleasure to drive. For being a naturally aspirated 4-banger, it also performs pretty well. It is a great daily driver that I am very proud to own.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought it in Feb 2007. It's a great car - and I would recommend it. A big issue with me is I wanted to get the car in light blue, but interior was an ugly beige, so got it in gray with black interior. I can't do beige upholstery - I hate it. Got the car with the ABS & side airbags as well, which was optional equipment at the time. Also, I really wanted the 5 door, even though the back end of the 5 door is kinda frumpy, but 5 door only comes in the S Model. The car handles well, the stick is real fun to drive, and has good acceleration. I think I am getting about 27-28 MPG. I like the fabric used on the upholstery, but the carpeting seems cheap. The car has a good solid feel to it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Car handles well - although road noise on highway is loud. Stick shift is smooth and shifts great, good braking, radio and rest of controls are well-designed and have good lighting at night. Downside to the dash is the plastic used in the center console below the radio looks kinda cheap. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have a 2007 Mazda 3 GS (which is second from the top of the line) this is a beautiful car. This car preforms at an extreme level and it has plenty hoursepower for a 4 cylinder automatic. When I needs to pass a car up hill or down the Mazda can pass it with no hesitation. I would definitely recommend a Mazda3 to anyone who was thinking of purchasing a fun car. The only problem I have with this car is that there is a squeak in the center console which Mazda says they can't fix. And after a night of the car being parked, the back brakes stick and then squeak for a few minutes, not a big deal but very loud. Besides these little problems that I found, this is an awesome and fun to drive car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system is amazing. 148 horsepower makes the car fun to drive. The steering wheel controles are superb. The four disk brakes are excellent when you needs them the most. The cabin design is very sleek and stylish.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had the car almost a year and have enjoyed the handling. The very first thing is the fuel mileage is very poor. In town is 20.7 and interstate is 25, not at all what I expected from a 2.0 engine. Took a trip to AZ and was surprised at handling in traffic, and it felt roomy. I found nothing extra in the mountains as far as power. I guess the engine is a little small, which brings me back to poor mileage. I love the dash at night, doesn't blind me when driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car specifically to improve upon the gas mileage I was getting in my Maxima. Even though it's rated for 35 mpg, I routinely get better than that when it's warm out (37-38 is not uncommon). What I've found really impressive is that at high speeds, the mileage doesn't seem to be sacrificed. On the drive from Salt Lake to Laramie, I must have averaged around 80-85 mph and still achieved better than 35 mpg. The stereo is great for a stock stereo and the MP3 jack is a nice touch. I previously owned a 2001 Protege ES which I thought handled slightly better than the 3, but the 3 is a much better looking car. Somehow with the same engine as the Protege, mileage improved big time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car about a month now and I can honestly say it is the best car I've ever owned (and I've had a new car almost every year for the past 6 years). It's fun to drive and sporty and I love the heated leather seats. Very minimal road noise compared to other cars that I've owned. I've been getting fairly good gas mileage, I'm not really sure how the people reporting bad gas mileage drive but I try to keep it under 2 RPM which is about 55 mph in 5th gear, and I've been getting upper 20's low 30's on average with mostly in town driving. On the other hand if I drive it like a sports car and stomp on the gas which makes the RMP's jump up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I knew going into this vehicle that it would not get as good of gas mileage as other vehicles in its class. That said, this car continues to impress me. I've owned for over a year now and drive a lot of miles commuting 80+ miles per day and travel with it alot. Now, after 40K miles the car is still running like new! I ensure the car is maintained religiously and that has paid off with zero mechanical problems to date. Oh yeah, by the way. To help counter the MPG issue, try this... slow down. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The pros for this car are: 1. Looks sharp! Looks like a BMW. 2. Great handling! Saved me a couple of times when faced with near collisions at highway speed. 3. Lots of acceleration when needed. 4. Comfortable. I like the seats shape.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 3 months of this car, I can honestly say its the most fun car I've ever driver thats been an every day driver. While not as much fun as a Porsche or a Corvette, this thing is still a lot of fun. This car has performance, better fuel economy, and can handle extremely well. Easily beats my sister's Pontiac G6 in every category except size. The handling is right up there with some of the performance cars I've driven before. This thing never feels like its going to leave the road. The interior color scheme is awesome, and I think it says a lot about the Mazda 3 exterior design when, after 4 years, it still looks better than the new Corolla and the Honda!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I loved everything about this car when I first saw it. Now that I have had it for almost 2 years, I am disappointed in the mileage. I do mostly city driving, and I am lucky to get 25 mpg. I was told I would get high 20s and mid 30s on the highway. No way that is happening. Also, I had the tires rotated, and the car is very noisy. Would prefer it to be a quieter car. Love the looks of it though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had owned one of the first 2006 redesigned Honda Civic Coupes - a car I instantly fell in love with. But I soon fell out of love with my Civic EX and decided to trade the car in. I have to say I didn't have the same passion when I first got my Mazda 3 but nearly a year later I am sold on Mazda. The Mazda has great handling and suspension. And for the price the build quality is an incredible value - Mazda has to be losing money on this. The power is definitely better than the Honda or Toyota. I do think the design is kind of boring. Oh the 2.0 should come standard with more than 4 gears</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased this car as a commuter for my wife. She averages 600 miles a week driving through the canyons into Salt Lake City. The car last year averaged 33.8 miles to the gallon through the whole year. This is climbing canyons with and without A/C. Highest mileage has been 36, lowest 31. Changing the oil is a breeze with the cartridge filter. Great power and tourque. Climbs a 6% grade in fifth gear with the cruise set at 70mph. Paid extra for aftermarket leather which was a plus. I really didn't like the Mazda seat heaters or leather. Horn is too soft. Paint is very thin and nicks easily. The Civic and Corolla don't even come close to this car in price or performance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking a sporty but practical car, and one that I could fit 4-5 adults along with a large dog (88 lb golden retriever) in the back. I have been very happy with my decision as it has overall been a great car. Fun to drive (manual), great handling/corning with 17" wheels, great in snow with winter tires & traction control and at 9K miles I have had no problems at all. Gas mileage is ok (26 mpg average) but would like to have smaller engine offered or other option on wagon to improve fuel economy for such a small car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun, responsive car for spirited drivers (manual). Small car with room for 4 adults and large dog in back. The rubber liner is a must if you have a dog. Received many compliments on the looks of the car (phantom blue). Like the storage compartments over the spare tire.</FAVORITE>

The Mazda3 2.3 5M is better with excellent handling, steering, braking and manual transmission. Good power and quiet engine. The car is confident and secure at all speeds and looks great. The interior is well designed and high quality. Getting 28-29 highway. Have 15,000 miles on car with absolutely no problems. I look forward to driving everyday.

<TEXT>Purchased car in June 2007, has been in the shop for poor mileage and squeaky brakes twice in less than a year. Mazda claims the car will get 31 m/gal city and 41 m/gal highway. The best I've gotten so far is 29 m/gal - this was obtained on an all highway road trip. Worst was 22 m/gal. Response from Mazda is that the mileage is considered normal??!! I will not buy another Mazda, they claim false numbers and will not stand by the product to find out what's wrong even when they agree there's a problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car really lives up to the mazda saying of Zoom Zoom. With all the features I could ever want in a car the mazda 3 surpassed all of my expectations. The 2.3 liter engine is quick. The throttle response time is quicker and when you want to go fast the only thing standing in your way is traffic. This vehicle is not only fast but it has a beautifuly designed interior. The handling is amazing, and so is the ride. The bose sound system is the best I've owned, and the heated seats are great.

<TEXT>I've had my 2007 GT for almost a year. It has been a fun car to drive and easy to live with. The versatile hatchback converts to a mini-SUV when you remove the cargo cover and fold the seats - I've had 14 bags of mulch back there! The 2.3 with automatic is peppy enough, however on hills with the AC running it can get a little strained. GT standard equipment is generous. Annoyances: over time some of the interior plastic panels have developed rattles, and the auto trans sometimes hesitates between 1st and 2nd gears. I would buy this car again but would go for the MazdaSpeed 3 with the manual tranny. Overall a great car which you can get loaded for low $20s.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for several months now. It gets better than advertised fuel mileage if not drivin too hard. I drive 50 miles to work everyday, over a mountain and average 36 to 38 MPG. I have had it on the open road and it gets slightly less, comming in at an average of about 34MPG. I think this is because at 75 MPH it is turning 3500 RPMs.You cant argue with getting around 400 miles on a tank befor the light comes on. I think the manuals could use a 6th gear.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I don't know what else to say about the mazda3 Touring sedan except it is a sweet, sweet ride. An absolute pleasure to drive. Lots of power, a pleasant little growl from the exhaust and it loves to go. Unbelievably responsive and grippy handling... just give me those twisty back roads! It's got a sexy, comfortable interior with easy to use controls and a great stereo. Firm seats that are great on longer drives. Absolutely fabulous on a summer afternoon with the sun roof open and people staring as I drive by in this sexy little car, with its copper red exterior sparkling in the sun! My only quibbles are less than great fuel economy and rear view when backing up. No biggie.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Zoom zoom. This car absolutely begs to be driven. The driver's position is like being in the cockpit of a fighter. What more can I say... this is a driver's car. Easily as good as cars thousands of bucks more expensive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased my Mazda almost a week ago and I absolutely love it! The interior design is extremely sport and like no other sedan that I have seen, which caused me to pick the Mazda 3 over the Mazda 6. I have been searching for a new truck for the past few months. Then I opened my search to cars and fell in love with the Mazda 3. I viewed it for the first time on a Monday and purchased that Thursday. Driving it is so much fun! My husband drives an Infiniti G35 Coupe and I wanted a car that can keep up with his. I'm not sure if it can, but he is not complaining, LOL. I was a little disappointed on the gas mileage on a long trip, however, this week is looking pretty good. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the illuminated dash and how comfortable the inside is. The power of the engine makes it great and fun to drive for me and my husband. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I replaced my 2001 Celica with a 2007 Mazda 3 wagon. Based on the first snow of the season, the Mazda 3 is the absolute WORST performing car I have ever driven. I got stuck in 2 inches of snow in the dip at the intersection! I can not make it up a mild hill that everyone else was flying up. My old Celica drove like a tank compared to this. I hope the problem is only horrible tires from the factory. If not, anybody want to by a used Mazda 3 Wagon? I should also mention that during the summer, the air condition could not keep up. It was 100 outside and 90 inside. The dealer said it was working fine. The car does have the utility inside that I was looking for in terms of a wagon. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Utility of a wagon. Good mileage (not to what was promised but it never is),</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Since buying this car early this year I have had an excellent experience. The fuel milage has been consistantly fantastic and the handling is awesome! I'm so impressed with this vehicle that I'm going to be purchasing another one in a month. Even with all the economic advantages of this car it still has a high performance ability for the road {ZOOM-ZOOM}.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a blast to drive even after owning it for 6 months. It has almost all the features you would expect in a luxury car and has the performance to go a long with it's good looks. The gas milage isn't what is advertised but then again none of the cars are. However, the transmition and engine work in harmony and I would sacrifice a little milage for the overall performance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After thinking long and hard about many different vehicles, I decided to go with the 3. I could not be happier with my decision. This car is sporty for a 4-banger, and with the manual tranny, it's fun-fun-fun. I honestly wish I would have gone with the SPEED version though (I didn't because I really need the sunroof). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the responsive motor. Acceleration is a blast in 2nd and 3rd gear up to 5K RPM. Excellent ride and adequate suspension from the factory. Interior and Exterior design is excellent IMO. I had to have the sunroof. I actually prefer the black cloth seats of the 07 vs the leather. Car is a blast!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the second Mazda3 I have owned. My first, a 2005 Mazda3 s, was totalled in September. I knew I would not own anything other than another 3! When we went looking I found another one, only this one is an s Grand Touring Sedan in Aurora Blue Mica. I love this one as much, if not more, than the first. Great ride, sporty, and more car for the money than many others out there. I look for excuses to get out and drive my car! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car and I highly recommend it to anyone that asks. However, I would like to see a rack option other than buying aftermarket model. All in all, this is a great car and I look forward to the 1.5 hours I spend on the road going to and from work every day. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Speedometer gauge is in beautiful gauge cluster. Unfortunately speedometer is recessed so far and covered by shadow, it is impossible to read at speeds up to 50 mph. It can be read only by bending down deep and losing view of the road. There should be a recall and improvement. This situation is so dangerous, I intend to notify the TSB.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having driven a ford escort (mazda SOHC engine) I wasn't accustomed to the PU. Beware, the motor hums in 5 gear from 35 to 80 mph. I literally touch the gas pedal and I get great response. So Zoom- zoom is real, beware. Keep it at or around posted speed. Speaking of Speed, I can't imagine dealing the Speed option with 260 hp, hello speeding tickets. Speed too fast unless your dealing with open highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I explored many others before choosing the 3 so I knew I'd like it, and it was a perfect choice. You can't beat all the standard features in this car that you wouldn't get in others. Steering cntrls/telescp, ABS/DSTC, full airbags, and very fun to drive. Tight handling! Took it on a small road trip right away and got 43 mpg hwy! One time only, I doublechecked, but city/mixed is only OK. It's my first manual and has the easiest clutch to learn on. I drove it home only having had 2 short lessons years ago driving an old manual Civic. The hatch adds much versatility, and everything about this car is designed to look sweet inside and out. Cntr stack intrudes on right leg, but not bad.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lighting affects on the gauges and cntr console; standard features you'd definitely pay for otherwise; moonroof/6CD package is great; easy clutch! Looks are top quality. I like pretty much everything about it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife got one of these as a loaner when her 06 Jetta TDI died, after driving it for a week, I loved it so much I went out and bought one for myself. It has excellent space, I'm 6' tall, and can sit in the backseat after I've adjusted the front to where I'm comfortable. The hatch is a wonder of engineering how it can be reconfigured with all the compartments, and it is big enough for everything I can throw at it. I love the seat fabric, it's comfortable, tough and cleans up well, and best of all, this car is FUN to drive! It handles great, and the ride is sporty without beating me up. Honestly, I love it more every time I get in it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Space, great styling, great handling. It already comes with the good stuff, 17" wheels, 50 series tires, good sounding stereo with MP3 input, steering wheel audio controls, comfy seats. Plus, it's got good power and is great fun to drive in addition to being practical.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first car ('05 3 s) was a lemon but I liked everything except its reliability so I'm trying again (with extended warranty). I got a White Pearl GT 5door and so far so good. 5spd auto seems to get better mileage than my old 4spd so that's a plus. Handles very well, frictionless steering and the ride is nice and firm. There is some body roll because of the high weight but it's nicely controlled. I love the heavy feel of the car and the dynamic driving experience. Also, the looks of the car still draw lots of compliments. The '07 model seems to have fixed the problems w/my '05- weak a/c, rear brake dust, harsh shifting auto transmission. I'm relieved and can now enjoy the ride!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>GT spec features: Xenon HIDs, trip cpu, heated seats, auto lights/wipers, LED rear lights & climate control. Also like the backlit gauges and steering wheel audio controls. Styling is spot on and it rides low on it's tires unlike the competition. 2.3L is refined all the way to redline.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my Aurora Blue Mazda3 5 door for 6 months and love it more with each passing month. The design and handling are the standout features. The interior is one of the best I've ever seen. The hatchback utility makes for a great alternative to SUVs. I nearly bought a Honda Civic Si sedan but the Mazda3 had more overall features that I liked and could live with on a daily basis.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling. It's not fast in a straight line but on a twisty road, it's a blast because you can maintain a higher speed than a lot of other cars.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Kinda stumbled onto this vehicle by accident. We were set to replace our 97 Jetta with a new one but we were not happy with changes VW made. Next looked at the Rabbit, but reviews kept mentioning the Mazda3. We figured it couldn't hurt to at least look at the Mazda3. Wow! We were instantly impressed with it! It's an amazingly fun and agile car. Every aspect of this car feels solid. No rattles or squeaks. The doors feel solid, the controls and gauges are easy to read/use. Initial mpg was a bit low, but with over 2500 miles now, we're getting better mpg each tankful. Lots of room in trunk area, good driving position and visibility. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Car has enough power to justify the aggressive. Some of the best seats I've ever been in. Handling is sure-footed with no lean or complaints. Happily goes where you want! The brakes could stop a truck! Huge glove comp! Proves that a reasonably priced car can be practical to own AND fun to drive!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned this car for 4 months now and continue to be impressed. After coming out of a BMW I wanted something "fun" to drive with good handling and the 3 has delivered. The GT comes with a long list of features in a car of this price range. The 5 door hatch has proven to be very versatile yet with the seats up can carry 4 adults in comfort. I wish my wife knew how to drive a stick as it would be even more fun with the manual tranny. At times the automatic hesitates a little between gears and can be somewhat difficult to drive smoothly. Also, on days over 90 degrees the A/C can seem a little weak unless you put on recirculate. I've already taken it on a 1500 mile trip - comfortable road car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first new car I've owned and by far the best. Everyone I know likes it and Mazda's definitely still reigning at top of the economy cars(if you wanna classify it as such). It drives like a sports car and the interior is so nice. The gauges at night are one of the coolest looking I've ever seen glowing a cool blue while other features are glowing in red. If you were an older person you might think that the interior is too hip, but being a 19 year old guy I enjoy staring at it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sport shift. People think it's a novelty, and it is, but I feel like I'm playing a video game. The low beams shine very wide and bright. Compared to my old car the high beams blind me. Of course, gotta love the hatchback.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving a 2001 Toyota Corolla for 6 years, all I can say is wow!! What a difference. The car came with everything I wanted and more. The acceleration and braking are fantasic for any car, let alone a compact. The engine is refined and never loses its punch, and the sport shift automatic tranny is a blast. The ride is much stiffer than my old Corolla, but it's not harsh. It has all the airbags standard. The handling is top notch and all the safety nanny stuff can be shut off so you can explore the car's potential. Left with the car 3 hours after the test drive. The styling inside and out is unexpectedly refined and sporty for a car in this class.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sport shift mode the the automatic is what set this car apart from everything else. Shift for yourself when you want and put is back in drive when you're feeling lazy. The moonroof is another welcome feature for an economy car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have just purchased this fantastic vehicle. I love to drive and I didn't think I'd ever trade in my 02 Jetta 1.8t. Who would ever think I would ever get rid of it, just because of the way it handled. But needless to say the Mazda3 surpasses the Jetta. Keep up the good work. One thing I would like it to have would be heated mirrors, and power front seats. I have the grand touring sedan.</TEXT>
