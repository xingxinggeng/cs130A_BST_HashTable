<TEXT>I have had the car since 2007. A great car to drive, but I have had many problems. Check light comes on for no reason sometimes. Trunk would not close one day. Visor would not stay up. Drink holder broke. Car jumps a bit when I change from 1st to 2nd sometimes. About 2% of the time. Electrics are been faulty and I have had to replace 4-5 bulbs. I think that is about it. Quite alot though. The warranty is great and they have repaired everything, but I am tired of taking it into the shop for repairs. Nice car, but just too many problems for me to consider buying another Hyundai. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice car in general with solid performance. Great warranty!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall I have been pretty happy with my 07 Sonata GLS. No technical or mechanical issues yet after 20,000 miles. My biggest problem has been the suspension which is designed for a light bicycle. Bumpy roads provides very strong feedback into steering wheel. Bottoming out is donw easily. So you Hyundai engineer lear from Honda Accord.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Low on maintenance, base model well equipped.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned my Sonata for 3 years now and the only thing I have done (besides the usual oil changes and tire rotation) is purchased tires. It has been better then I could have hoped for. Like most people I shopped around and was saying to myself, "Are you sure you want a Hyundai?". I'm pleased I took the chance.I paid 17,500March of 07. It as sun roof, XM, AM/FM Radio, CD, alloy wheels, automatic, all the controls on the steering wheel, well it's loaded for a GLS model. Any other brand with the same options was $28,000 for the cheapest. I want mention brands but it was the standard companies. Way more BANG for the BUCK.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Audio System sound great, the steering wheel controls are easy to use, comfortable ride, enough power for passing, and affordability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car has 40k on it. The car has run flawless, but the gas mileage is only about 27, 28 on the highway. My 2002 accord would get 32mpg. Early on I was displeased with the dealer oil changes. The oil always looked dark gray after changes. I do it myself now, and it looks fine. My wife took the car in for a brake switch recall. She gets the normal hard sell on the dealer maintenance. Hyundais have very expensive 40k checks. $298-$598. The rear brakes are totally worn out at 40k. They said that was very good. I have never replaced rear pads with less than 80k. Tires needed replacing at 35k. I will not by another Hyundai. Cost to own is too expensive. I will stick with my Hondas. </TEXT>

<TEXT>From the time I drive my sonata off the lot the air has never worked properly and when I go to the dealer to have them look at it they want to charge me, Nice I bought it that way why should I have to pay. Every time I touch something it breaks. (sun visor broke after 1 week). My mother-in-law has one and when it rains she was getting soaked. My check engine light came on for two days.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a former car dealer and thought I would never buy a Hyundai. I absolutely love this car. Great gas mileage, cold air, nice performance, smooth ride, nice horse power, and very stylish. I like it so much that I am now looking at a Genesis for my wife. She deserves it. To say the least, I am impressed with the Sonata. Also, it is easy to maintain and the fact that I get the performance with 87 octane is a big plus. I have driven 4500 miles and the mpg was still at 31 to 32 mpg. Great Car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my car for 2 years and have replaced the a/c in it 3 times now. It is currently in the shop for the third a/c. I bought the extended warranty and it is a joke! They want to do things the cheapest way possible and dont care if it fixes the car...hence 3 a/c's in 2 years! I love my car otherwise but hate these issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car as it seemed to present a good value for money. I liked its V6 performance, interior design and very nice exterior. Considering how hard I drive this car, I'm content with its reliability so far, after 23k miles. A real problem surfaced at around 20k miles, when I noticed brake noise. I thought it was the wear indicator on the brake pads, but as it turned out it was my rotors. Initially I got pretty upset at the dealership as they suggested rotor replacements - thought they were trying to milk me - but as it turned out, it's a common issue with the 2007 model. Yes, I too live in the New England area and see a lot of road salt. You get what you pay for - car was cheap</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bouncy ride and poor quality. Rear brake pads worn to rotors at 21,000 miles. Hyundai said rust caused this problem. I have never had a car with rear pads worn to rotors with 21,000 miles. I bought an extended bumper to bumper warranty for 10 years 100,000 miles, but hope I never have to use it because I'm sure they will find some excuse not to honor it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My rear brakes need replaced at 21,000 miles. Dealer said it was from rust on rotors and caliper pins sticking. Also they said it was because of driving in bad weather. My wife drives this car and very seldom when roads are bad. Replacing pads and resurfacing rotors at 21,000 miles is ridiculous.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Sonata has been a great car to drive. I drive it as a second car and it has become a "sort-of" utility vehicle. The room in it is fantastic, great for the trips to Home Depot or Lowes. The seats are somewhat uncomfortable on a long trip, but the gas milage makes up a little for the comfort. I think Hyundai needs to make a change on the front seats. All in all, a super car. Having owned 2 Lexus' I would consider an Azera next trip around.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have driven Hondas and Toyotas for years, but when it came time to replace a 1993 Accord, we drove the "97" Accord, several Toyotas but kept going back to look at the Sonata. In the end we went for the Sonata because of the value for the dollar. Warranty, options and it just feels like a secure car. Fit and finish are on par with Honda and Toyota. The 4 cylinder is more than adequate for day-to-day driving and road trips with a family of four. Our first trip on the interstate with 3k on the engine still averaged 30 mpg. Not bad for a fresh engine. The final test will be to see how it handles a winter in the upper-midwest...</TEXT>

<TEXT>My father owns a Mercedes and owned Lincolns before that; but he's been so impressed by my Hyundai that he's going to get the Sonata. He's tired of his Mercedes being in the shop and the standard luxury features in the Sonata Ltd can hold its own with any luxury car and it has been just as reliable as my brother's Honda's and Acura. I'm sold on the brand. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm not one to make rash decisions, so it took many months (almost 3) to finally decide on the 07 Sonata. I looked at the Big 3 Japanese competitors - Accord, Camry & Altima, and I have to tell you, for the money, features and warranty, none of them even came close to giving me what Hyundai did at the price I paid. I have owned my car for over a month now and am so glad I made this purchase. The V6 engine is so smooth, and can definitely "pop" your neck if you have a heavy foot. I continue to get nothing but compliments telling me what a beautiful car it is. If Hyundai continues on this pace, I will definitely buy new one in a couple of years. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched more than 10 cars over the last 8 months comparing gas mileage, saftey features, reliablity, price, and looks. The 2007 Hyundai Sonato won hands down over the other makes & models. There is simply more car for your dollar. It is safe, gets very good gas mileage for the V-6 and it's size in SW Pa. (24 miles/gal+), it looks, feels, and drives like a luxury sedan! I am impressed thus far with the feel of the car - it is also fun to drive! And there is lots and lots of room in this car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the interior and it has a sharp looking exterior. I get a lot of complements on it. The numerous saftey features go all out. I am pleased with the gas mileage. I love the V-6 option. The other creature comforts are numerous and easy to find. Giant trunk. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have now owned my 07' GLS for a little over a year with zero problems. After 13,500 miles it drives like the day I bought it. Great mileage--I get between 28 and 31mpg on every fill up (mixed driving). Hyundai's commitment to quality for an excellent price with a great warranty is almost too good to be true. Plenty of power for a 4 cylinder, smooth ride, and all the safety and features you need. No wonder it is a top 10 best selling car in America. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety standards:6 airbags, abs, traction control, electronic stability control. The trunk is gigantic, gas mileage is great, smooth ride, and overall excellent value. Highly recommended. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned both Toyota and Honda vehicles over the years, but tried the Sonata this time because my co-worker got one and he likes to run cars till the wheels fall off. I told him I was thinking about a new car and he let me try his Sonata Limited. Whoah- I was surprised- it was better than what I expected from a Hyundai. The Sonata had Side curtain airbags, Stability control, XM radio, roadside assistance and a 10 year warranty- ALL STANDARD! If you try it, you?ll rethink paying more for a Toyota and Honda with far less features. For me, the Sonata GLS had everything I wanted, except in- dash NAV. I never had satellite radio in a car before, and this XM radio rocks! </TEXT>

<TEXT>So far, I've been happy with this car. It has a nice ride, and a lot of interior room (espescially in the back. The trunk is very nice as well. There are a ton of standard features. in comparison to many of the competitor cars, the Sonata drives just as nicely, costs a few thousand less, and comes with a 100k/60k powertrain/bumper to bumper warranty. The car does NOT get as good gas mileage as the sticker would indicate. I drive on the highway about 85% of the time, and tend to get around 26 miles to the gallon (sticker read 24-33). I expected a little more than that.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car has some great standard features, keyless entry, cruise control, Stability control, tire pressure monitoring and XM (which I never use, but if you like Satellite radio, there you go).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've been driving this vehicle for almost 10 months and have been quite happy with the ride and quality of the vehicle. I traded up from a 2005 Elantra for the simple reason that I needed a larger door opening due to recent knee replacement and mobility problems. The car is comfortable and quiet, especially compared to my daughter's 2005 Camry which I consider a comparable car. I think I purchased the safest, most quiet riding, and best performing vehicle I could find in the price range, give or take $3- 4K. I would definetly buy another, or possibly the Sonata Hybrid when it becomes available. My only problem was with a dealer installed remote starting system that has to be reprogrammed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cruise Control, nice sounding stereo, comfrotable seats, and 10-12 airbags that make me feel safe. Also comes stock with my favorite Michelin tires. It seems like lots of attention to quality components was paid when this vehicle was designed and built.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Nice car for the price, but still a lot of space to improve on design aspect without real additional cost, e.g. suspension! Engine is nice and powerful, but not as quiet and fuel efficient as competition. Brakes are excellent, but no way in comparing handling or refinements of this car with BMW 5-seires, as advertised! I believe it has better value for money than 3.3L Azeras. You are not really upgraded with a Toyota or Honda! Next step is a BMW, Luxus, or Mercedes! Engine noise when you look at it at ilde with hood open, seems more than one expects from such a beautiful piece of engineering! Can't feel the difference Solar Glass is supposed to make! Functional, but not beautiful dashboard!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powerful engine, smooth transmission, excellent driver view, very good build quality, generic/classic exterior look, value for money, automatic rear view mirror, Audio sound quality, Automatic climate control, big trunck, acceleration, ESP, ESP, ESP!

<TEXT>I have nothing but praise for this car. Despite it being a 2.4L, it drives close to a V6 with great pickup and acceleration which is great with today's gas prices. It is well built, comfortable, looks good and has many interior features for which one usually has to pay extra. Also important to me is good peripheral vision and the roominess it provides which is one of the biggest reasons I traded in my 2004 Honda Accord coupe with only 9K. I am very glad I did. That is one sweet driving car!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm in love with my new 2007 Hyundai Sonata Limited Platinum Edition. The value I got for this car is amazing. I paid 23.3 including taxes and fees. I was in the market for a Toyota Camry, but I saved about 5000 going with the Hyundai. Toyota wouldn't offer much on my trade in, Hyundai did. And I got a V6 in addition to leather heated seats, and a great warranty for the same price as the Camry SE with the sunroof spoiler package(that was my first choice). </TEXT>

I just traded my 2004 Envoy SLT XL for a new 2007 Sonata Limited with XM. It rides very smooth, is very quiet, and gets very good gas mileage. I really got a super deal from Hyundai of Decatur.

<TEXT>I was shopping for a replacement for a '98 Accord EX V6 and read Edmunds review of the Sonata shootout with the Accord and Camry, so decided to check this out. I had been aware of Hyundai's dismal reviews for earlier models and was very surprised after a drive in the Sonata. The handling of the car is composed and feels secure for family driving (I drive an '03 Infiniti G35 coupe, so I can't call it sporty), power is more than adequate (better than the Honda), and quietness of ride at 75 mph is better than the mentioned Accord or Infiniti. Fit and finish easily match the Accord. MPG thus far (with 3,000 miles): 20 city, 27 highway. Thus far I'm very impressed with the Sonata SE.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I don't like my new Sonata Limited Platinum - What a huge mistake! The main problem I have with the car is the outrageously over-sensative electronic throttle. After 3 weeks of driving it I have a horrible ache in my foot because I'm always holding it in a wierd position up off the throttle. I'm unable to rest my foot on the throttle at all, there is no swivel arm action either, the gas pedal is just a hunk of plastic. The vehicle is also VERY slow to upshift on full acceleration. I've had to adjust my driving to allow for a second or two before the car actually takes off, however when it finally does decide to go it really get's up and goes! it is fast and safe, I will give it that. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This has proved to be an excellent car, excellent build quality, tight and quiet, with plenty of power and good fuel economy (24 mpg). The only negative comment I have relates to the radio controls on the steering wheel. There is a control called mode which changes the radio from AM to FM to CD, but ther is no control to move between stations. A small thing but annoying.</TEXT>

<TEXT>1 month into a 24 lease on a bare bones Sonata GLS. Only extras mine came with are carpeted floormats. That's fine b/c my lease payment is peanuts. This car is surprisingly powerful for a 4cyl. It's decent off the line but on the highway it's really superb. It's cruises at 80 effortlessly with more power to spare. I've only got 1300 miles on it but my mileage has been around 24mpg overall but I floor it most of the time. Comfort is decent. Car drives very well, has good road manners and feels well composed. Car certainly isn't flashy but I like it's clean looks and I really enjoy driving it regardless. For the money, I think the Sonata is unbeatable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is not your 80?s Hyundai any more. It may take some time for this manufacturer to recover from prejudiced assumption that Hyundai cars are ?Casio? of automotive industry, but those people who had a chance to drive recent models and then check specs and workmanship, should know better already.The price is reasonable by comparison, warranty is excellent, quality of drive and comfort is a pleasant surprise and gas mileage is real nice. After buying mid-grade Honda and Toyota for many years almost religiously, and since in last 2 years I did not like what I see, so I started turning towards Nissan yet it appears that I just discovered Hyundai to be very interesting and quite logical choice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>There are many details within technical design of Hyundai vehicles today that appear to be cross of technology of the best and most expensive cars on the market today.

<TEXT>I traded in a CX7 for a 07 Sonata SE, and me and my wife love it. It is so quite inside and drives really smooth. With all of the safety features included this is tough to beat for the price. The 3.3 v6 has all the power you could ever want in a "family" car and has decent gas mileage as well. We are getting around 22 city and 28-31 Highway. Overall I would recommend this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been driving a 1988 BMW 735i since 1988. Also, own 1987 Toyota Supra, wife drives Cadillac CTS -- sometimes I get to drive . The last American brand car I owned was a 1986 Mercury Capri with 5 litre V8. I do not buy, or drive ordinary cars. The car is made in my home state of Alabama in the worlds most advanced assembly plant. I was sold on the car immediately after a test drive. I tried out most of it's competition -- Hyundai beat them all. If it was a rear wheel drive it would be a world class car. If and when Hyundai assembles a rear wheel drive in the Montgomery, Alabama factory -- I will trade in my front wheel drive Sonata. Best buy on the market. Price was reasonable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My choices were not too many; Camry I4, and Sonata V6, about same price, but feature-wise Hyundai was far ahead. The car is not my ideal of course, as I am more tuned to European styles, and this one is mde for Americans! If with replacing shock ansorbers, I could acheive a stiffer suspension, I would have done so, but I am not sure where to find this! Maybe in Hyundai Germany!? Otherwise, everything else is just about Perfect. Maybe too early to say, as I am drivingthis only for 2 weeks, and sill in break in period (till 2,000km). Seats are comfortable, Audio system excellent, very silent indeed (in idling you need to look at RPM to see if engine is running!) I'll update this in 2-3 months</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Sonata ROCKS</AUTHOR>
<TEXT> I traded a 2002 Elentra for the Sonata. I had 160,000 miles on the Elentra and never had any issues with the car. So my natural choice was Hyundai and I wanted to upgrade. I commute 125 miles a day and after a month I am averaging 32 MPG in mixed city/hiway driving. With a commute of so much distance comfort is important and the Sonata is very comfortable and I am 6'2". I was worried about the cost of my insurance going up but with all of the standard safety features my cost actually dropped by almost $150 a year from the Elantra. The bottom line is buy a Hyundai Sonata, you won't be sorry. Great gas mileage, comfortable and it turns heads. I may buy Hyundai's forever!!</TEXT>

Sound system is great, car is exceptionally quite except road noise which is a minimum considering.The trunk is suprisingly large and the back seat is roomy and comfortable.

<TEXT>Well, I have owned my Sonata gls 4cyl auto with sports package for two months now. I had shopped cars in this class from all of the manufacturers. I can say I am very pleased with the car. I haven't found a single defect that makes me want to return to the dealership for a fix. They did a fine job of manufacturing in Alabama. So far, the fuel economy has averaged city/hwy at 23 mpg--and there are a lot of hills around here. The 4cyl has demonstrated plenty of power when entering the beltway from a ramp or when climbing hills around town. Hyundai resale values will be climbing higher with this kind of craftmanship. A strong buy from me on a great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT> I traded in a 2006 Chevy Uplander Minivan as the gas mileage was horrible. I checked out the Camry, Impala, and others and nothing compared to the value of the Sonata. I had to get a car that would allow three Child seats in the rear seat. The seats fit fine as the vehicle is classified as a large car it has plenty of room inside. The vehicle rides smoothly and the 4 cylinder has provided plenty of power. I also have the premium package and the floor mats. I would say that this is the best car in its class for themoney and possibly not even considering the cost. The five year warranty also puts the vehicle at the head of its class. I would recomend this car and the dealership to everyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a very nice car. It moves very well. It sits comfortably. Power when you need it and a nice growl on acceleration. Quiet with great Infinity music setup inside. Major problem: I was hit by a Saturn turning right from a left turn lane in front of me at an intersection. The driver's front headlight area took the hit. The bumper popped loose, the fender was pushed back against the tire and driver's door which wouldn't open and the hood was bent beyond repair. Normal fender bender speed of less than 20mph... normal repair cost $2500... this one $5000. Now the worst part: Depreciation in 8 months and 8500 miles was 54%. Even Without an accident, Hyundai said it would be the same.</TEXT>

<TEXT> I test drove Camry, Accord, Galant and Sonata. In terms of performance, and comfort, I think there is no significant difference among these competitors. Sonata, however, is $5000 less than the comparably equipped Accord/Camry, and $3000 cheaper than Mitsubishi Galant. According to JDPower and Consumers Report, in terms of overall quality and reliability, Hyundai cars rank third or fourth, just behind Toyota and Honda but ahead of Nissen, Mazda, Mitsubishi and other second-rated Japanese cars. Knowing that the quality of Hyundai cars has improved tremendously in recent years, I wanted to give the benefit of doubt to the Korean underdog, just as I extended the same to Toyota 25 years. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Hyundai engineering department needs to pay more attention to the drive train to truly make this an outstanding car. The interior/exterior, suspension and handling are all fine on my 2007 Sonata. The engine and transmission is where this car falls on it's face. The transmission shifts entirely to lazy and slips with the engine revving in to the next gear, this shows lack of refinement. The drive by wire system allows the engine to rev slightly while coming to a stop and then rev slightly again when lifting your foot off the brake, very annoying to drive with this revving. I am putting up with these problems for now and trying to get used them as the dealer say's it's normal. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a bit mystified by the disappointing mileage achieved by the in-house reviewer. I have taken three road trips in exess of 2,000 mi. in my Sonata, each with two adults and luggage (sometime golf clubs too). The worst overall mileage I've gotten on these trips, which includes city driving, idling in parking lots, one hour delays on the interstate for accidents, etc., is 28.7 mpg and the worst was 31.4. I don't think the onboard computer would lie to me. In everyday driving, it never has gone below 25 mpg. Anyway, the V6 is really powerful, it corners like a bat, stops on a dime, is roomy, comfortable and has never had a single thing go wrong...what more could you ask for?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Let me start by saying that I researched and test drove about every car under $23K prior to picking the Sonata. In doing my research I made price the least important so I could be sure that I got the car I wanted without price being the driving force for my decision. I needed a car that I could put 3 kids in sometimes but got good gas mileage since I travel a lot. I found that the Sonata had more interior room in every aspect and trunk space than any other car in its class and got comparable mpg. The build quality is easily equal to that of its Japanese rivals. I was going to buy the V6 but opted for the 4 banger. It has tons of torque and adequate acceleration. Best car I've ever had.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love that most of the "features" are stock and not extras, as with most other cars. Most surfaces are soft to touch, sturdy, and wouldn't be out of place on a car costing twice as much.

<TEXT>I bought the Hyundai Sonata because I am fed up with North American car that keeps on braking after 100 000 km. I will say this in my 23 years of driving the only car I have ever driven that compared as far as quality and comfort was a 1984 Buick Century. The Hyundai Sonata is an outstanding car that easily compare to its Japanese competitors. I honestly find the comfort surpasses what of the Accord and this while being $4000 Canadian cheaper then the Accord, for the same equipment fit. I own a GLS 3.3 6Cyl 5A. In short it has great fuel economy and outstanding comfort. And Exceptionel comfort. The only negative is the road noise being louder due to leather seating.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My GLS XM doesn't have the MP3 input jack, or the leather-covered steering wheel and leather-trimmed shift knob, which is odd, because these are standard features! The sticker said it came equipped with fog lights, which the dealer confirmed, but there are no fog lights...which I found out driving home the first night I owned the car in a thick, blinding fog! It seems that there was a shift in the trim lineup the very week I purchased the car. This is something I'll have to resolve on Monday, when the dealership reopens. Meanwhile, this car is so peaceful to drive; it's like riding on a velvet cloud - but with great road feel and steering-wheel feedback, as well as decent handling. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I tested the Toyota Yaris and the Camry before I purchased a 2007 GLS I4 Auto. The I4 is easy to maintain and service (change parts/spark plugs, etc.). It will save you money over the V6 in the long run. The I4 is powerful and economical. The engine compartment is well organized and the quality is high. Quiet at 70+mph on "a smooth" pavement. During my last trip, I got 37 MPG (over 90 miles, speed 60-65 MPH). This is great for an engine during the break-in period (70+mph expect 34+mpg. Mixed expect 30+mpg). 800+ miles with no problems or strange sounds.</TEXT>

A few little quirks: 1) Seats heaters only slightly warm, can hardly feel through your coat. 2) Seats have no lateral support, more like a bench feel than a bucket. Seat bottom way too short to support your legs on longer drives. 3) Radio too high and far away. No matter where you sit, you have to lean forward out of your seat to reach the channel knob and some buttons. 4) Brake pedal soft, spongy and fade under high demand. 5) When cold, squeaks and rattles. 6) XM sound quality awful; cd/mp3/fm sound is fantastic. 7) Steering wheel should tilt, not just raise and lower.

I also love the new body style of the Sonatas, it's a very classy look. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one when my wife's car needs to be traded in or sold.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The price was unbeatable. Ride is smooth. Acceleration for passing is super. I get 24mpg combined city/hwy which is slightly below my expectations. Ride is smooth. Overall, I believe this auto has great value for the dollar without sacrificing ride or quality. A nice ride, nice looking, and it comes loaded with an awful lot of standard equipment.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Pretty decent MP3 player. I love the automatic climate control, just set it and forget it. Leather seats, compass, auto dimming rearview mirror are pluses. Strong A/C performance is welcomed as I live is hot steamy Florida. Heater on a rare chilly night doesn?t disappoint either.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I read everything in sight and did a lot of research. After driving both the 4cyl and the V6 we decided on the 4cyl. Our dealer was very cooperative and let us check the cars out and get in some realistic drive time. It is very responsive and has plenty of get up and go. We have not experienced any of the few negatives that I came across in our research. My daughter has had a Hyundai for 4 years and highly recommended this brand to us. </TEXT>

<TEXT>While very excited about my initial purchase based upon reviews, it was only a week later that creaks, squeaks and clunks began to appear. After three trips to the dealer the problems only seem to be growing, and are the kind of problems I do not expect adequate resolution to be forthcoming despite very good involvment from corporate. I suggest staying with Honda or Toyota. They cost more for a reason.</TEXT>

<TEXT>my wife and i purchased our sonata last fall. it was the most car we could find for the money. we are very happy with it. it has a smooth ride and great comfort. it is an extremely quiet ride. the pick up is adequate, although there seems to be a little drag shifting from 1st to 2nd if you are easy on the gas. the gas mileage is average, about 24 city and 28 highway. if you stay at the speed limit or lower, it improves. i did get 33 mpg on one such trip! the cd system is great.the abs and 4 disc brakes work extremely well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Leased my Sonata GLS '07 (with extra trim) in Feb 2007. Debated between this and a Jetta but cost-wise I chose Sonata. It is good overall, except comparing to the Jetta, the quality of the sound system of the Sonata is inferior. Also, the seat of the Sonata does not feel as tailored to the passenger as the Jetta seat is. But it is definitely much BIGGER inside. I enjoy the space. I owned a Jetta and enjoyed it and really like the sporty style and feel of it. But now when I look at a Jetta, it seems to look too small! It's a nice change, but I think that being single, I would still go back to a Jetta next time. Get a Sonata though if you have a family. I don't think you could go wrong. </TEXT>

The base GLS model had all of the features that I was looking for, was more roomy on the inside and costs a lot less money than the Honda/Toyota. The warranty is superior as well. I never thought I would own a Hyundai, but they have really stepped it up! And my Sonata was assembled in America.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our sonata less than 2 weeks ago. And honestly we love the car .... but some problems that come standard on some sonatas. Center console makes rattlling noise. Bad shocks on the rear suspension. Also the mode button on the weel was getting stuck. All those parts are going to be replaised by the dealer. But other than that we love the car. And i just wanted to say all that for the people that a going to buy one of those cars. The onlything i didn't like so far is that the car tends to slide from stop on snow but that's why there is the stabiliy control. The red colour ROCKS.

<TEXT>While I only have 1400 miles on my '07 leather limited V6, overall it is a nice car on par with Camry & Accord but choose it because of better features for the buck than either. Minor, but nice styling changes since 06. A personal choice: I had them change out the 17" wheels for 16's for better ride with taller sidewalls since this is not a Corvette I plan to be pulling 6G corners with. The engine design is old school and the fuel mileage shows it. Hyundai needs to follow Honda's edge here in engine tech. Also, Hyundai needs to get into the hybrid market with a peppy Sonata hybrid in the 30-40 mpg range. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Pros: great features for the price of the car, heated seats, nicely appointed interior & good control & insrument layout,peppy but well apportioned accelerator,good exterior styling and body fit, roomy trunk, good ride (not too stiff, but good handling),nice little cubby holes for sunglasses, etc.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the best bang for the buck if you are looking for a family sedan, far exceeds the value of the Camry and Honda and exceeds the value of the mid/intermediate class such as the corolla, civic which I compared, The brand will evolve to be a powerhouse and increased market share w/ bring prices higher to where they should be, approx 3-4 higher at least, which is found in the warrenty, nevermind the undervalue price in what really matters ....and thats the bread and butter of the family car, saftey,warrenty, soundness, and comfort. this drives very similiar to a buick century.</TEXT>

The car has been back to the dealer who reports that there was not any problems with the syste. I called Hyundai directly and they said that I should bring the car back to dealer. The instruction manual states that the system will activate when the passenger has the seat back in the full upright position, the seat all the back, no leaning on the center consol or arm rest. On one trip she got in the system went on but when she dozed off and her body moved the system was deactivated. I tested out the system with one of the 5ft 2 girls in my office, no luck.</TEXT>

After driving by the Hyundai dealer many times looking at others, I thought I'd drive one. Wow. For about $8,000 less than a similar optioned Camry I drove off in the new black leather Platinum Edition and have no regrets. Guess I can't tell any more jokes about this company. They truly do make a fantastic car. If your looking for a new car, you owe it to your wallet to drive one of these. Either that or settle for a cloth interior and 4cyl.

<TEXT>I have had my Sonata for about a year now and love it. The only problems that I have had were my brake lights went out (covered by a recall) and my visors would not stay up, apparently this is a common problem. But when I took it in to the dealership today, there were no questions asked and my car is fixed. Air conditioning is awesome! I live in Scottsdale and it get's HOT! My car is black and it cools off in no time. The pickup is great, and it is a very smooth ride. I have XM capability, just haven't signed up for the service. And of course, the safety features are awesome. I think most unexpected was if there is an engine fire, the inside of the hood drops and smothers the fire!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased after my Camry was totaled. Comfortable, nice driving. Sun Roof rubber seal is off already, passenger window sounds very strange. Took to dealer, charged me 69.00 and says nothing is wrong. HATE the cruise control, it is awful! Will NOT hold speed up or downhill AT ALL. Has to be on FLAT highway to work mediocre.Got pulled over right after I bought it due to lousy cruise control downhill. My Camry NEVER did this. So though we like the car and drive it at 22000 miles in one year, still have reservations on it lasting. Loaded it up to within an inch of it's life and drove a 2800 mile vacation in Utah and Arizona, got 35 MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Leased in 2007 for two years. Returned in June 2009. Needed new tires and brakes by 22,703 - in less than two years! Car had nice acceleration and was a smooth ride. The car had a nice look. However, the quality of the tires it came with and brake problems have soured me on the Hyundai brand. And, since my replacement tires weren't matched to the original brand, Hyundai is charging me a second time for two tires. I'm sure it's standard lease policy, but it feels wrong. I'll probably shop for another brand and avoid Hyundai all together since I anticipate having problems with any of their cars within only two years of purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a 2007 Sonata GLS, and I am glad I got this car rather than an Accord or Camry. Excellent ride quality, superb stereo, good air conditioning and best of all the SHIFTRONIC transmission which allows me to shift into manual mode whenever I drive. Any day the suspension is better than a camry or accord. Spare parts are cheap and I buy them online. Warranty on the car is best in the industry . Fortunately nothing has gone wrong till date. Since reliability is a problem with older Hyundai?s I run my car on Pennzoil Fully Synthetic Engine oil, with a K&N oil filter and synthetic transmission oil. Resale value is a problem in the car, but I am positive that Hyundai will do well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our Sonata new 22 months ago and have enjoyed driving it. This week, after 22K miles, the rear brakes started making loud, grinding sounds. The dealership installed new rear brakes, pads, shims and clips at a cost of $265. Hyundai headquarters sees this as normal wear in New England with the sand and salt and all. My 50 years of driving tells me otherwise. Something is wrong with the Sonata brakes. The service manager at the dealership explained the companies concern over the issue. The company itself was unconcerned with my complaint. If you drive a Hyundai in New England, be forewarned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've never owned a car before that needed so many visits to the shop for things that shouldn't be going wrong. I've had to replace the tires and rims at least 3 times because the rims aren't sturdy enough to handle New England pot holes. It's been for parts falling out of the dashboard numerous times, the dashboard itself has been replaced, the recall on the passenger seat airbag, cracking in leather (dashboard again), issue with key ignition sticking when you start it. I think this car was built during a non pay week, just before a scheduled vacation!! Now the Santa fe we bought at the same time... the exact opposite, it has so far been a joy to own! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have way too many good things to say about this car that it won't fit here, so I will only discuss the bad things. #1: the ride is on the harsh side. Wheels are 215/55/17, which do not belong on a family sedan. Need to bring them up to 60 series. #2: I have yet to find a perfectly comfortable seating position. Maybe it's because my previous car had bucket seats and wasn't leather, but who knows. Oh, and the lumbar support is a joke. #3: CVT. I may get used to it over time, but right now I'm not a big fan of it. Look it up on wikipedia.com if you don't know what it is. Other gripes I have are in the Suggested Improvements sections. Don't get me wrong, it really is a great car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>At first I thought I really did well getting a Camry-like car for $3000 less. The V6 is smooth, power when you need it etc. The car is comfortable and you sit higher than in most other cars. The heater starts working within a mile. The car would be completely fun to drive BUT The BIG problem is that the 17" rear-suspension makes clunking noises on bumpy city roads. A Nov. fix supposedly doesn't include my VIN (according to dealer). In fact the car is weak on sound proofing There are other noises in this NEW car such as squeaking rear window, A rattle somewhere in the front roof as well. If you want precision carmaking, this is not the car for you - what a disappointment & hassle.</TEXT>

The NHTSA says it is even better than the Accord in its side impact crash test ratings and costs thousands less. Only thing I would change is the look of the climate controls, a little dorky.

<TEXT>WOW! I love this color! Was the first thing I said when I saw my Sonata onthe lot. Now I just say, "WOW, I love this car!" It rides like my grandmother's Cadillac, but handles like my Saburu did. When I first moved to Northern Virginia, I was always making U-turns. There was never a car that could make a U-turn like my Saburu, but now I have a Sonata. Hate to say it, but it is as good as the Saburu! The perfect combination of everything you want in a car! The feel of safety you get the first time you stop on a rain slick road. You know you have the right car, Plus, unbelievable trunk space. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my 2007 Hyundai Sonata for 2 weeks. After a few days, I realized that when I turn on the rear window defroster there is a lot of interference with the radio reception. Also, some of the defroster "wires" don't work at all. I took the car to the dealership. They confirmed the problems, but didn't repair them. They are currently "talking" to Hyundai to see what they will do. This is ridiculous. This is a NEW car with major problems and Hyundai can't decide what to do. For me, the only option is for them to replace the rear window. I think I made a BIG mistake by purchasing a Hyundai.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Second Sonata, first was '03 that I put 332,360 miles on... most reliable car I ever had so the '07 was a no brainer. Did lots of research over a 6 month period, it all came back to the Sonata Limited. Styling (clean and classy), loads of standard equipment with plenty of safety features and the expectation of the same or better reliablity then my '03 make it the best buy in the marketplace. Car is powerful, smooth and fast. Controls are well placed and have a solid feel. Many thoughtful touches include plenty of storage inside and lit window switches and steering mounted controls. Handles like a true sports sedan. Front seats have great shoulder and back support. Rock on Hyundai!!!.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, handling, forward visiblity over hood, seats and materials are high quality, a list of standard equipment as long as both my arms, great nighttime lighting; thank god Hyundai did not equip this car with those stupid daytime running lights.

But with Camry and the Accord being out my price range, I test drove sonata and was shocking surpise it had as much horsepower and more safely features and a much much better warranty.I was able to get the sonata limited for less than I was going to pay for the base camry with icthing cloth seat.its a really great car to drive thanks Hoover Hyundai, i'll see you in 3 years when i get my Azera </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had my Sonata for a few weeks but so far I love it. It definitely handles really well, and is less bumpy than I thought it would be. I'm 6'2" so I need a fairly large car and the Sonata has more than enough rom for me. The back seat has plenty of room even with my seat almost all the way back. I upgraded to the premium package. I like the power seat, and its pretty comfortable. Volume control on steering wheel is nice. The only thing I dont like so far is that its a 4 speed automatic. Its kind of slow getting going, like after a stop light. It lacks that immediate kiddy up. It has plenty of power on the highway, but going from idle to about 25 MPH is a little slow.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great looking car and plenty of room. Great trunk space and folding back seats. Great warranty and safety ratings. I bought mine for $16500 plus tax which I thought was a great price. Handles very well, very smooth car around turns. Very easy to drive. Nice brakes. I like my trip computer.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall, like most, I find this car a great value with comfort and convenience equal to the equivalent Accord and the Camry. In addition to all the positive things said about the Sonata, I'd only add that I find the mileage I get to be perfectly suitable. In easy city driving, I'm averaging about 23.5 mpg, and after a 2000-mile interstate trip I just completed, I averaged 28.5 mpg going 75-80 mph, even with one tank of 10% ethanol gas. This seems to me most reasonable and very much in line with the 30 mpg the car lists for a lower speed. Given those figures and all the other positives about the car, it's hard to beat for the price: nice look, good power, overall decent comfort.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car rides very quietly, accelerates well merging into traffic. Flawless, unnoticeable speed shifts in automatic and incredibly smooth shifting from auto to manual. Car can be downshifted to 3rd gear in a mile+ small grade downhill and will keep 2000 rpm and 40 miles per hour without using the brakes. All the cars around me were riding the brakes. At the end of the hill, one forward push and the car goes back to 4rd gear without hesitation and a medial push of the transmission lever and is back to Auto mode. The trunk is deceiving when looked from ouside but open the trunk and 16 cubic feet of space are ready for any trip planned. The back seats are foldable and very comfortable. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very smooth, quiet ride with good performance and fuel economy for such a large and heavy car using the 2.4L 4 cyl engine. My car said on the door for overall gross weight: 4,299 pounds and yet you do not feel the engine starving for power(162HP). Hyundai is showing awesome commitment to quality.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the car for the value, but was surprised at the overall quality of everything. My wife and I both commented the car is very much like our Infiniti I30, handling, ride and all. I30 in 1996 cost us about $10,000 more than what we are paying for the 2007 Sonata. Have only 450 miles on it so far, but hope the reliability is as good as I30. Potential buyer should expect that this car has a firmer and stiffer ride than a boat-like ride of the Camrys. On a rough road, it does give a lot of dull thud sound (not thumps as some people describe in various forums). I hear this types of thuds in almost every car. It is just a matter of degrees, depending on the suspension design.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet. Cabin is just as quiet as the three infiniti's I owned. Engine noise is louder than Q45 and I30 but not offensive. Handling is better than the '05 Toyota Avalon I owned. No rattle or squeak.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love this car. My wife & I wanted a mid- size car that was quiet & rode smooth. I did some research; we rode in the Camry (06) & Altima (06). Altima is a nice car; has more sporty feel & thus not quite smooth as the Sonata. If difference in ride comfort of Sonata & Camry exists then we didn't notice it. Look at the price difference, throw in the warranty, it isn't even a contest. Everyone who sees/rides in our Sonata is sort of stunned. It is a refined car & yet they haven't heard of it. The V4 was peppy, but we opted for V6. We do a lot of highway driving so we wanted the power that a V6 offers. Also, it is more quiet than the V4. Quietness of the V4 pertains to all the models we looked at.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought Sonata about a month back, and every morning I feel happy that I made a right choice. I compared Camry, Accord, and Sonata. The base model GLS has all essentials and lot of premium features. Safety features like ABS, ESC, 4 wheel disc brakes, Traction control are all standard. The sound system is of premium quality and has mp3 decoder built in. Interior is specious. Trunk space is huge.The night driving is comfortable due to bright head lights.I own a 2000 Camry, and the Sonata sounds little bit noisier due to wind noise. I get about 28 mpg with 60% freeway and 40% local driving. I have 1100 miles yet and I am hoping the mileage improves from here. Its great value 4 money!!! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Standard Safety features. Premium sound system with mp3 decoder. Luxurious interior. Much quieter than Accord, and only slightly noisier than Camry. Excellent eye catching exterior look. Good driving height (like Van or SUV). Great 10 yr powertrain warranty. Best Value for Money in the class.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought the Sonata as a second car. We checked it out because of its outstanding standard safety features and ratings, great warranty, good reviews in the auto press and outstanding value. Originally was shooting for a 4-cylinder but the prices were so good we ended up with the 6. The fuel economy is somewhat worse but you sure feel the additional power. It's a very quick car. Compared to the Kia Optima - I actually preferred the V6 Optima (dynamically, its looks and the dash design) except for very uncomfortable seats in the Optima. The Sonata is comfortable in town, easy to drive, quiet, roomy, and initial quality is very impressive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am really happy with this purchase. Test drove the Accord and '06 Camry. This car beats both of them on performance and feel. Then comparing price and warrantee is what sold it for me. I paid 18000 "Out the Door" for mine. For $1500 more I could get a v4 Accord or Camry. Big deal - the H on my car is an italics H - as opposed to the non-italic Honda H. I like the car's style and feel and general value. No issues. Its quick and fun to drive. I only wish I got the LTD with leather and the better stereo.

I am a large man and the room was incredable. My son (6') sat in the back behind me and he had plenty of knee room. My wife enjoys the heated seats along with all the room she has for her legs.

<TEXT>I had intended to purchase a Toyota Camry because of strong satisfaction with previous Toyotas. However, the Sonata has more front head room and leg room than the Camry, which is important to me because I'm 6'5" tall. Also I like the looks of the Sonata better than the new Camry. The fact that the Sonata does not have an engine immobilizer system, which is standard in the new Camrys, also influenced me. I feel strongly that potentially unwanted features, such as an engine immobilizer, should be optional not unavoidable. I've only had my Sonata for a little over a week, but so far I'm very pleased with it. I bought the 4-cylinder GLS model for fuel economy and find it to be quite peppy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. We came to the dealership just for a test drive and immediatly fell in love, we just had to buy it. I mean it felt oh so comfortable, was safe and everything we wanted and more.I think the car is meant more for a family of 4 though, because there isn't a middle head rest.At the dealership we were at we traded in a car and they gave us big bucks more than what is said for excellent. They wern't too pushy either like most other dealerships we've been to. I reccomend this car to families who love spacious feelings, having a smooth ride, like getting a good deal on a car, like to have fun while driving it and pretty much everyone!I love it so much!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Like others, I compared the Sonata to other cars in its class, and found that the features offered for the price, made this an easy choice. However the car has an annoying front end shimmy at 44 mph, which has yet to rectified.It seems to be a problem in 6 cyl. models with the 17" wheels. I have contacted Hyundai and lets hope they can resolve the problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Test drove Civic, Camry, Accord and nothing came close to matching the value of the Sonata. Everything you need is standard at a better price than the others. Also much easier to make a good deal at the dealership. Huge amount of safety features standard, the trunk is huge, and it kind of looks like an Audi or Acura TL from the front and the side and rides like them too. The best warranty is just icing on the already great cake!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Sonata has a very smooth ride and great pick-up for a 4 clyinder. You get a lot for the base model including electronic stability control. front and side airbags, keyless entry, power. windows and locks. The interior has very nice upholstery.

<TEXT>I have put over 11,000 miles on my new Sonata. I have not had any problems. If i say at or below 75 on the freeway, i can put over 500 miles on a tank of gas. It cruises at or above 80 easily and quietly though the gas milage drops to around 28 to 29. what more can you ask. roomy, quite, great gas milage for a full size car and a long warrenty so i don't have to worry about fixing anything unil i am ready to trade it in in about 4 to 5 years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As I prepared to replace my wifes 2000 Ford Contour, I went with a clean slate and looked at everything. The Ford had been a good car with no problems in 75K miles. After looking at, studying (thanks Edmunds) and driving everything from Infinities to Camry's to Accords, I bought the Sonata Limited. While we have not put a lot of miles on it yet, my initial impressions are very strong for this car, even in the class of competition it had. It is powerful enough (better than the peppy Contour V6) and very quiet. Maybe not as powerful or quiet as the Inifiniti, but I can live with the difference in my bank account.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the leather and climate control. The quiet, smooth ride is something we have lived without for 6 years in the Contour. The Infinity Sound system is very nice, but runs out of steam at higher volumes. Oh...and really love the way it looks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded a Ford Escape for this vehicle for a variety of reasons, most prominent the lack of power for my trade, and the awesome power of the Sonata. I live in Los Alamos NM, with steep mountain grades and a base altitude of 7200' and rising. I test drove a Sonata GLS for a weekend prior to buying (with the same V6 powertrain) and was quite impressed. The Limited that I recently bought is even more impressive, quite a bit more so than even the Hyundai Azzera, which I also test-drove extensively. This is an EXTREMELY FINE automobile thus far in all respects, even though I paid too much due to the negative equity on my Ford trade. Nonetheless, I have NO REGRETS whatsoe</TEXT>

<TEXT>According to JD Power & CR, Huyndai's have better initial quality and overall dependability than Toyota and Honda for 2006, which is consistent with Edmunds Sonata, Camry, and accord midsize shootout with cars evenly priced. After the research, I found myself in a car with a 10 year warranty (instead of 3), better initial quality by JD Power, greater dependability by Consumer Reports, Na V6 w/235 HP, full curtain side airbags, Vechile Stability Control, Traction Control, full power, a sun roof, Alloy wheels, great interior fit and finish, more interior space, a quiet er ride that accord or camry with a auto manual shifter and performance to match. Gotta test drive one and see for yourself</TEXT>

<TEXT>After test driving the Camry and Accord, I was unable to find a $5,000. difference. I found the Sonata to be equal in most comparable aspects except perhaps mileage (17.26 mpg in city). I feel after purchasing my Sonata for $19,761. I can buy a lot of gas with the savings. The luxurious interior incl. leather, auto driver seat, multi use rear view mirror, arm rest console, automatic power door locks (need to be activated) and a HUGE trunk are my first impressions. Hyundai's superior warranty is great for me and those who like to keep their cars a long time.</TEXT>

My Sonata has only been in the shop once, and that was for a warranty replacement of a head light.

<TEXT>I bought the Sonata back in August of 2006 brand new and since then it has had many problems. Both sun visors have had to be fixed, alarm had to be fixed, it needs new tires, an oxygen sensor is starting to go bad, and the trim is starting to come off. The dealership doesn't want to work with you and everything you call about they say is not under warranty. In order to test the car to see which oxygen sensor is going bad they are going to charge me. I have never had this many problems with a car or a dealership. You would think that in this economy a company would want to keep customers but apparently not. I would not recommend this car to anybody and i will never buy another one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned 07 Sonata for 2 years - 24500 miles on it. My recent experiences suggest that there are issues with the Hyundai Quality and Warranty claims. I had to change my both rear brake pads, and also change one rotor, resurfaced other after just 24000 miles! Surprisingly front brakes that should take 70% of braking torque were perfectly fine. Dealership said that the pads and rotors are not covered under warranty and charged $350. I have never heard rotor or even pads needing replacement in 2 years - shows poor quality of parts. Hyundai Consumer affairs would not cover even when Dealer agreed that this was not normal wear and tear. Had to change Alternator just 2 months back! Don't count warranty!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride is good, sound system is great but now I am not sure how many more "wear and tear" parts are going to fail - the ones not covered in warranty. I have taken extended 10 year bumper to bumper warranty but not sure whether that would be useful as claims could be denied!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my car used about 11 months ago with 23000 miles. I now have 28000 miles. In that 5000 miles, it has been in the shop twice for engine knock. The second time they had to call Hyundai tech support twice. I didn't pay anything,and it doesn't knock anymore, but hmmmmm.... I also think the rear suspension has always been a little noisy, but now after the coldest January in 30 years,it sounds like I may have a rear strut problem. It kinda sounds like the car is banging on the frame. I will have this checked next time it's in. I'm disappointed because I really do like this car. Hopefully it's nothing and I will be a happy girl for a long long time. Wish I would have gotten the xm radio.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have 2007 Sonata 3.3L V6 Limited for two years already. I bought it new. It accelerates pretty well, but, car hesitates a little when it shifts from 1st to 2nd speed in auto mode. Avg MPG is 20-21 city, 23-24 HWY (with A/C on). Suspension needs to be stiffer to avoid leaning on corners and steering feels kind of numb at low-parking speeds (in comparison to 2007 Santa Fe, which is great). Seats (driver's one is 8 ways adjustable on Limited) are fine. At the same time, driver seat should be more comfortable for long trips and provide better lumbar support for a healthier posture (as on Santa Fe again). Trunk is spacious. Quality of front cup holders sucks, but it is fixed on 2009 model.</TEXT>

<TEXT> Well, after reading alot of reviews about the 2007 Sonata, I had to go out and test drive a couple. I went to a car dealer that had a V6 and a 4 cylinder 2007 Sonata parked side by side. I test drove both of them and what a thrill. The 4 cylinder had almost the same feel as the V6. If someone told me that, I would not have believed them. I owned a 98 Honda Accord V6 and the 4 cylinder felt almost as powerful as it did. So, I ended up buying the 4 cylinder Sonata and it is such fun to drive. I took the long way home just for fun. I appreciate all the reviews that other people shared. All of them came to "life" when I drove the Sonata for the first time. Go Hyundai.</TEXT>

It is reliable car. It does pretty well with millage plus it is fast enough. I love to ride in the backseat, it is so comfortable, but the long window during a sunny day will burn your neck in the back seat. There should be a radio station changing on the steering wheel. Steering wheel should be telescopic. The shoulder rest should be a bit longer or at least should be expandable like in European models. It could be a bit quieter at the back, the ride is smoother in the front seat than in the back. I think that is all</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like everything about our 2007 Sonata The safety features were a great selling point for the dealer. We like the gas mileage @ about- 26 in city driving. This is my first foreign model car, and I wish I had been turned onto these years ago, but at least I can enjoy mine now. I have Parkinson's Disease and entering and exiting a car is very important. This fits the bill for me. We enjoy driving this car because of the peace of mind we have concerning safety features. We've only had this Sonata a month, and already I am heartily suggesting Hyundais to relatives and others...as I am doing here. I am already considering upgrading to a new 2009 Sonata.! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The safety features are great, because we have changed from an SUV Trailblazer to this smaller mid-sized car. The seats are A#one.

<TEXT>We recently purchased this vehicle as a one year old vehicle. Has compared it with the 2008 Accord, Camry, Corolla, and Malibu. The price was great, and we saved $6- 7000 over the 2008 Accord or Camry. We are impressed. The car is roomy, comfortable, quiet, and has great trunk space. It feels like a much larger and higher priced car. Safety Features and Warranty are great and better than other comparables. MPG has been 24-25 average, high twenties on the highway. The fit and finish is very good to excellent. It does not feel or sound like a 4 cylinder at all. Very easy to park, and fits in the garage well due to short trunk lid. Great headroom and glass area. I would recommend to friends.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sleek modern design. 4 Cylinder is quiet, smooth, and feels like a V-6. It also gets 10-12 mpg more than our former Lincoln. Sunroof and stereo are great. I like The front end and rear lights arrangement better than competitors. Standard 16" Michelin tires are great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I must say I am very impressed with the sonata, my first brand-new car. I drive over 51k hard miles per year and I have had no mechanical problems. The vehicle is reasonably quick, the XM and all of the safety features are great and it is an excellent highway cruiser. Fuel economy is between 21- 29, I've never cracked 30. Build quality is generally good but I don't think the paint should chip so easily nor should the plastic protectors at the bottom flake off. Still this vehicle is an absolute bargain, I considered a Camry and accord and the Hyundai drives just as well them---at a lower price and a with a better warranty:)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent travel/business vehicle! XM (every car I get will have it!), safety features, stability control and traction control in the snow!, discreet but sharp looks, lack of unscheduled service (except for headlights), I've been impressed with the car so far.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Car handles very well. Gas mileage is GREAT!! Head room in front is not very good. Cup holder in the front is not very secure. Lots of room for a mid- size car. I test drove a Honda Accord and a Toyota Camry and this car drives as well or better than both of them. Not as nice inside, but for the money it's a very good car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My 1st time buying Hyundai & got ~7.5k miles on it so far. Need to put on more mileage before I can rate its reliability. As for quality, the workmanship could be better, as I already noticed a (very minor) leak on the trans bell housing seal the next day after I got the car. I 1st noticed from the fluid drops on my garage floor. Also, some of the body panels don't line up perfectly with the bumper (also very minor). Considering what I paid, I can live with such minor defects. The gas mileage seems nowhere near what's claimed--I drive 1/2 hwy & 1/2 hi-spd suburban roads, but my trip computer tells me ~21.5mpg (on the 3.3L V6). Other than that, a pretty nice car w/ good features for the $$!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the 2007 Sonata at 0% APR. No interest, nothing beats that. I was looking for car with all the safety features. I don't care about horse powers or handling at high speeds. I care about going from point A to point B more safely than my old car. This car does and saves me a lot of buck. 260 hp is not going to get me to work/grocery any faster than 160 hp. So if you are looking to get a good car with good safety features and save a buck while at it, go with the sonata.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I have a history with Hyundai. My wife currently has a 2003 Santa Fe and I have had a 2002 Santa Fe prior to getting this car. I say that because we think enough of the company and their product to continue buying from them. I am very happy with my car. I purchased a GLS auto with xm radio, moonroof and 17in. wheels instead of the 16 in. standard. I have read reviews that have stated the car has average pickup in highway traffic. Let me tell you that sometimes I have to ease up on the peddle, if you know what I mean, an have no problems getting in and out of traffic. I look forward to a continued great relationship with Hyundai!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I now have just over 20,000 miles on my Sonata and to date 0 problems. For a car in this class I have to say that Hyundai hit a home run. Plenty of power and considering the engine size and horsepower, fuel economy is very good (22+ city, 32+ hwy). This is a fun car to drive, very comfortable on long trips, great handling and I can put up with the little noise of the suspension at this price. If you can find a better car at this price than please let me know. I looked at Toyota and Honda's before purchasing this car and I found the Hyundai Sonata to be an exceptional value. </TEXT>

When we returned, I got in the car first thing Monday morning to go to work and it wouldn?t start at all. Completely dead. (We had not even made a single payment at this point and the odometer read 400 miles, most of which were accrued when the car was shipped up from South Carolina for us.)

<TEXT>I've had this car for almost a year, and over 18,000 miles later, no significant problems to report. For the money, it's been a good investment - secure handling, decent factory sound system, airbags everywhere, comfortable ride. Minor annoyances include a drivers side seat that "rocks", it never really feels like it's locked completely in place. The wheel covers are CHEAP and easily scraped all to pieces (or maybe I'm just abusive and used to alloys?). Gas mileage isn't as great as I'd hoped (mid-20s). Just this morning I heard a squeal under the hood - will be going to the dealer to have that checked. Lastly, the check seatbelt alarm could cause incurable insanity. Worth a 2nd look!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love his car. I feel like I got Toyata/Honda quality at .85% of the price. Tight, smooth ride. Great controls. I suspect that, like Toyata and Honda, Hyundai is heading upwards in price in the upcoming years. Buy now! The older HYundais, like the 2000 Sonata I also own, are.let's face it, pieces of expendable junk. I get the 2000 repaired and, two weeks later, some "check engine" light comes on and I'm in for another $500. But starting in 2006 Hyundai seriously Uped their game. Now this is a car I can live with. Remember how we thought Toyota was a piece of Japanese junk back in 1980? That's the path Hyundai is taking. Before 2006...junk.

I dont have to worry about bumping the stick when I check the oil.Plenty of room, cupholders in the back, and plenty of airbags. Nice car,at a nice price. I bought as a 2007 clearance.

<TEXT>Very nice car for the money. Handles and rides nicely. The transmission shifts slowly from reverse to drive, and is kind of jerky in the process. It also surges when accelerating from a low speed. Also the glove box rattles. Other than that, it seems to be a great car. Got backed into by another car while mine was parked, so I am driving a Toyota Camry rental while my Sonata is being repaired. They are very similar cars, but I like the ride and handling of the Hyundai Sonata better than the Camry, and it's easier to get into and out of as well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was ready to purchase a new Ford Fusion and on a whim I drove a new Sonata. It was smoother and more refined than the Fusion. The 17 inch 55 ratio tires made the car ride rough so I bought a set of 16" 60 ratio tires and wheels, then sold the 17s back to the dealer for more than I paid for the 16s. The ride is greatly improved. It is stupid to install low ratio tires on a nice car and expect to get a good ride. I had firm foam put in the drivers seat. The car has been flawless, No problems!!</TEXT>

Hyundai's warranty is included in the price and it's 5-yrs bumper to bumper, well almost..! I always had Fords or British Leyland cars. Before buying the Sonata I looked at the v6 versions of the Fusion, G6, Mazda-6 and the Altima. The last two were too expensive. When comparing the Fusion & G6 the Sonata out paced them in all areas. I got a great deal at the dealership who's knowledge of this product was excellent. I have done 13,500km without any issues. Those journeys from Calgary to Edmonton are less tiring now & more comfortable. Excellent car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I certainly do not understand the expert car reviews. The Hyundai Sonata is sluggish: the auto tranny is sluggish and jerks in acceleration, interior is weak and has no personality, and the windshield cleaner devices are like 'eyes' looking back on me. Why did they put these ON TOP of the hood? Bad bad design. The only good thing I can say about it is that it is great on gas. I would really loathe driving it everyday. Thanks to Edmunds for rating something so well and now I am stuck with a car for 4 years that I do not enjoy. Do they build cars cheap so car reviewers can get kick backs? </TEXT>

<TEXT>After 20 years spent almost exclusively behind the wheels of Fords and other mainstream American autos, I hit my limit on providing endless vehicular life-support: it was time for something new. After a bit of research, I decided the Sonata best suited my limited budget and high annual miles. On paper/screen, it looked great..but would it meet expectations? In some ways, yes. This is a heck of a car for the price, with lots of features standard, and some nice additions in the plus package (like the auto-lights, trip computer, etc). But shockingly, my new 2007 4-cyl gets measurably worse fuel efficiency than my 1999 or 1993 6 cyl Tauruses. So much for that stereotype! economic</TEXT>
