<TEXT>My conservative friends thought I was nuts when I leased this vehicle, after all they used to see me driving Lexus or at least a Tahoe. But I was looking for a car that has these 3 qualities: 1. Fun to drive, manual and 4-wheel; 2. Convertible (to take advantage of sunny weather); 3. Has towing capability. I did not want to buy Jeep, because I knew this maker is not a reliable one. And that's why I leased it. To my big surprise, I had not had any problems with the car in 30 mo, and the latest Consumer Reports show very high reliability ratings for Wrangler. Jeep really did an excellent job on re- designing this model. What a huge difference comparing to a previous Wrangler they used to make!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drives like a toy, manual transmission, soft top, I don't think they would legally let me drive this truck some terrain I have taken it thru,)) Looks and drives like a man's truck! Chicks dig this car, and other Wranglers will wave and welcome you to the "family". You re buying a lifestyle w/Wrangl.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my Wrangler for about 2.5 years now and I have to say I love it. The only real complaint I have is about the tops. I have both soft and hard tops and they are put together very badly. I've brought it into the shop for top at least 8 times now. 5 of those are for water leaks. They have not real way of stopping them, just a short term "oh the weather stripping is crushed" blah blah blah. I will never buy a new model year again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4wd is awesome. Definitely can go many different places.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Wrangler first was a 1995..sold it and now bought a 2007 with only 12,000 miles. The Wrangler is my weekend fun machine. The ride is comfy and stereo is awesome. The top is way easy to drop and put up. I upgraded the wheels and tires, not the suspension because it doesn't need it in my opinion. I don't extreme off road. The new design is by far the best because it's still looks the same just bigger and better than previous years. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stereo with Aux. input, lockable center console, awesome interior design and the always rad detachable doors and rear seat. Seats are very comfortable and it's actually pretty quiet for a wrangler. Amazing all around and through out.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the worse purchase I've made in a vehicle. It's been in the shop 3 times! It left me on the side of the road one too many times. The engine light has come on twice already. The engine needed a lot of work. Hey, guess what? The engine light is on again! This time it is for the cat converter efficiency. How the heck does a cat converter go bad in two years! The dealer will fix at no charge, but I am waiting for the next time the "check engine" light comes on. Maybe a couple weeks? I hate this vehicle. I will never again buy American! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Jeep! This is the first one I have owned, but when I was little mom had one. It deff takes me back 20 years and I love it as much now as I did then! Door off, top down is the best! Not a lot of power in this little Jeep but I didn't buy it for that. Handling is really good and ride quality is surprisingly great!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride quality and open air! Those are my 2 fave parts. Plus with fuel mileage around 18-19, I can't complain.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my third Wrangler and my first 4 door. Excellent handling on the road but have already been stuck off road, something that never happened in my 2 door. But the family loves the extra room and comfort and it tows my boat much better. Love the easy to use top but have had some leaking in heavy rain. With top down the seatbelt vibrates loudly. Really miss my In line 6 engine as the 07 seems underpowered at times and reves high. Over all though this is a great vehicle with high marks in styling and curb appeal. With the top down on a sunny day it just can't be beat. Remember the Jeep Wave when you are out and about.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Convertible top is easy to use. Style and curb appeal. Tows well. Comfortable cabin with lots of room and love the power windows and locks. Goes anywhere and you enjoy getting there in a Jeep.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A previous Jeep owner I was excited to move up to the 2007 4 door and it has not disappointed. I'm approaching 60,000 miles without a single mechanical or quality issue. Even the tires are still the original and I'll bet I get the rest of summer out of them. Obviously I travel alot and I also pull a fairly large trailer for my business so this Jeep is worked hard. It's not a sports car but I find the power to be more than enough, even when towing. I love this Jeep and will continue to buy this vehicle for a long time. Just thought it would be helpful to review after 60,000 miles. Good luck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Reliable work horse that is too much fun especially with the top down. Killer stereo, better than my wife's Mercedes. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 4th wrangler. I have had this one for 2.5 years. Maintenance so far is 2 recalls, rear brakes at 18,000, electrical problem with ESP light, new exhaust, wheels are starting to rust, and a mystery rattle from under the jeep which took 4 trips to the shop to fix. I absolutely love driving it, but going to the shop so many times has become a bit tiresome. I have thought about getting rid of it for something of better build quality, but then I get behind the wheel and I just can't do it. I do worry how much this thing it gonna cost me once it's off warranty. 31K miles so far, I hope the kinks have been worked out. Gas mileage is about 19MPG, and that is mostly back road driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have longed for a Jeep for years, but always needed something that was also practical for the family. Now we have both! I have to say that I love my jeep. Fun and easy to drive, great seating position, enough niceties to take the "rough" edges off for the family. It's plenty roomy enough for vacation trips or trips to Lowes. Compared to older models, I also feel much safer with my kids in the back of the 4- door. The sunrider top is also great... rain in the forecast? You can pull pull the top off the cabin in minutes without taking the whole top off. Yes, it's a Jeep thing... and I am good with it! Just try it for the ride before you buy!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sunrider top. Great stereo with upgraded sound system. The whole Jeep experience. Ability to customize almost everything with aftermarket gadgets and accessories.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my '07 2dr Sahara for just under two years now (just over 36k miles) and I STILL love it. I haven't had any problems so far. I have a hard top and haven't had any leaks whatsoever. I've experienced "death wobble" in my previous Jeeps, but I've gone w/o on this one so far. On the 2dr, the entry to the back seat is pretty ridiculous compared to my older models- we call it the "jungle seat" b/c tarzan would probably get in just fine, but every1 else feels outrageous. Passengers complain about comfort, but this is the comfiest Jeep I've had yet. I receive compliments wherever I go and I've felt completely confident each time I've been in a tough spot (lots of snow/mud/dirt!)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power windows/keyless entry.. I cannot explain how long I had waited for such a thing to exist on Wranglers! And the stock sound system w/ sub is actually pretty decent.. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After one week of ownership I am extremely satisfied with my 2007 Wrangler Unlimited X. The automatic transmission shifts smoothly, the brakes are terrific, the heater is scorching hot, and the ride is comfortable. The downside is mostly gas mileage, but I my commute is short and I average less than 15k miles per year so I'm OK with it. For all the things you don't get with a Wrangler, you do get a really fun truck to own. I'd buy this truck again in a minute.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My second Jeep, with the first being the limited edition '02. I have an unlimited X and love it until the windshield was replaced not once but 6 times, and the whistle is still there. I got tired of taking it back again and again, so I had to have stripping placed around the shield so I didn't drive it into a tree. The problem is solved, but not the proper way, just a band aid. Takes a PhD to design it and a high school graduate to repair it. Go figure, it's not fixed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall looks, sunrider top, sporty design, soft tight ride. I cannot wait for the sun to come out so I can finally get the Jeep naked up top.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 4th Wrangler. Had a Sport, a Rubicon, and the original Unlimited 2 door. This is it! The engine is the same as my Chrysler minivan engine (has 160K miles on it, runs great). This Jeep is great for camping, gets excellent mileage, the rag top is the easiest to remove (6 minutes by myself), and looks so awesome I have to carry my salesman's business cards around to give to people who stop and talk to me about it. Does ANYTHING I ask it to! This IS the one you've been waiting for.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Red Rock crystal paint color is about a foot deep, looks wicked good with a fresh wash & wax job. Best handling yet, excellent acceleration, but still very stable. Fits four people, two tents and all their camping gear with room for souvenirs. Like taking a vacation every day.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fantastic car! Have always wanted a Jeep, but did not purchase one several years ago due to the rough ride and noise. The new Sahara is awesome, rides like a dream, very comfortable with a lot of new safety options. The new hard top makes storing much easier with the cool benefit of having 3 pieces. Smooth enough with great amenities to be used as a primary vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Unlimited X-4door 4 wheel drive in February 2007. Have 1000 miles on it. Took it over the mountains and it snowed. The vehicle handled great. Only put it in 4 wheel drive once, smooth transition. Have an automatic, and at times it doesn't want to lock in gear when shifting. One problem I did have, I was driving 25mph when the light came on showing wheels slipping and the Jeep lost all its power, shut down. Love owning a 4 door. My first Jeep!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had the Jeep for about 1 week and I love it. I waited for 12 weeks to get the MyGIG in it and it is worth it. I love the way it handles as well as the look and response is not as bad as I thought. Got the 18 inch tires, great look. Manual transmission is smooth but engine revs stay up even when clutch is in, and foot off gas pedal. Doors have to be slammed shut. Interior is a Jeep no place for change or sunglasses, and poor position for cup holders up front because 6th gear blocks access to them. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I traded a 04 Murano for this because I wanted extreme offroad capability and I was tired of all the comfort of leather/power everything. I knew what to expect of a Jeep (3rd I've owned) and have not been disappointed. This is only the base model and I have minimum features. I wanted to modify this myself so now have a blank canvas to work on. The soft-top seems nice and I look forward to the summer with it down. So far, with temps in the 20's, this lil monster warms up just fine and stays warm on the highway at 70mph. Bumpiness is something to get used to, but like my 350z, you get what you pay for. The suspension offroad feels good and the 4WD is nothing to scoff at. Lots of power to play in.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine feels nice and tranny feels solid. I like the vinyl seats so much better than cloth. 4WD is always fun. Soft top is also a plus to enjoy when the weather warms up. A very comfortable setup inside and out. So much I like and so little room to write.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Jeep and I absolutely LOVE it! It is so much fun to drive, and it's unique. The only negative thing was waiting for over 2 months to get it. I ordered one but it was taking too long (get a clue DC! Don't offer products you're not ready to produce) so I found another one I loved on the lot. The 4-door has lots of room and handles very well so far. Gas mileage isn't great, but that's a given with a Wrangler. My previous car was a Honda CR-V which is built on a Civic base. I am VERY happy with the Jeep and do not regret the purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Wonderful over all design, comfy seats and steering wheel, beautiful exterior design, rides well, no complaints about road noise (with the soft top), wonderful Infinity stereo system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love it! Fun, comfortable, enough power, sits high, rough and tough, a real head turner ( can't keep people away, they want to look at it, lots of great comments). I love the simplicity of the interior, easy to use, big dials, big door handles. Men love it and so do women. One women told me it was a chick magnet and a client told me it was classy, a stranger told me it was nicer than a Hummer ( I agree, cheaper too!). Remember this is a Jeep not a sports car or Luxury Liner. You get a Jeep with lots of good frills. I love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks, the ride, the interior space, and the bulky exterior and interior. Removable solid roof is great. Plenty of performance.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Only 4K miles and now looking at a possible third transmission. Have been without the car for more than 5 weeks. An annoying rattle turned into a much larger problem: I would depress the clutch, the shifter would then pop out of gear into neutral without even touching it. Then, while driving and in gear, the shifter would simply pop out and into neutral. No clutch action necessary. Now on the second transmission. Very loud all around gearbox; difficult to shift--esp into third. Last night, went to start it: depressed clutch and stepped once on gas pedal and released: next thing I know, engine totally revs like I am still stepping on the gas! SCARY! I just want a replacement--auto trans now!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Wrangler Unlimited Sahara a couple of weeks ago and have been thoroughly enjoying it. It is not a racer but that is not the point. Whether on the freeway or on muddy dirt roads covered with snow it feels stable and safe. There is plenty of room front and rear and the cargo space is huge. The hard top keeps things quiet and the infinity speaker system rocks. I have the 3.21 differential and have driven for fuel economy. So far mileage is running about 24.5 mpg in a mix of in-town, freeway and back road exploring at 6,000' to 8,000' altitude. Expect to shift a lot at freeway speeds in the mountains, everywhere else it keeps up with traffic. It's my first Jeep. I love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned a couple of Wranglers over the years and the 4 door is by far the best version so far. Rides great and turns heads. Family of four, we traded in the minivan. Softtop is fine in the winter, no need for the hardtop. I noticed another review where the owner indicated the engine shut down while in driving mode. This happened to me once on the highway at 65mph. The console lit up, the gauges went wild, and then the engine cut off. It fired back up after a few moments but I had an 18 wheeler behind me and a pucker factor of ten. It seems to be an electrical problem as the engine was running normally prior to the event. Look for a recall soon at a dealership near you.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hands down, the 2007 Wrangler Rubicon is the most capable civilian production vehicle in the world. Period. The front and rear locking differentials that come standard do their jobs, as does the electronically disconnecting front swaybar. In terms of on road comfort, you can tell that it's designed to be driven offroad, but it's still super-fun to drive. The tight steering makes is a joy to park and maneuver in town, while allowing you to dodge trees on the trail (or to create your own trail). The seats are very comfortable, the radio is great for it's being waterproof, and who can turn down the ability to drive anywhere you want...with the top and doors off no less.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I ordered this Jeep back in October, then found out that they had a leaking problem with the hard tops so I waited. I didn't get my Jeep until January of 2007 and it's well worth the wait. I had a 2000 Jeep Wrangler which isn't a family car at all. I didn't want to break down and get a 4 door family car until I saw this. By far this was the car to have. My wife was happy that now it is a family car but it's still a FUN car to drive. I can't wait until summer time so I will be able to take off the top. More people will be getting whiplash when they see a 4 door convertible coming down the road. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I feel this is the perfect blend between the toughness and utilitarianism of a Jeep and a family vehicle. My family of four fits comfortably in it for the drive to school and trips yet I still have the ability to take the top and doors off fold the windshield down and ride offroad trails in my Jeep. My mileage for the year will be more but I have not had it a year however I feel I have put a hard 5,000 on it and given her a thorough shakedown and love everything about it. I have found it hard to come up with a negative for all the positive things I could say about my Jeep.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love everything about it especially the fact that I can fit 4 people comfortably in a Jeep and if needed it has room for five. Best of all it is the coolest vehicle in the lot when I pick my kids up from school including the H2 and 3 according to the other kids and teachers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my 2007 Rubicon for about 2 weeks now and I love it. I traded in my modified 2005 TJ Rubicon. I really missed it for a couple of days but after some mild off roading and a few rocks with the new 2007, I haven?t looked back. The new Rubi is so much more comfortable and quiet. The back seat is harder to get in to than with the 2005 Rubicon and the 05's 4.0 engine with 6 speed manual seemed to have more pick up than the 07 3.8 with auto. I was really impressed with the electronic sway bar disconnect. It is still completely stock and crawled over some smaller boulders really nicely! This is my 4th Jeep and I would have to say the best one that I?ve ever owned. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2007Jeep Wrangler greystone pearl X, s package, power package,17' rims with soft top. I've always wanted a TJ about 17 years now. Being in the market for a new vehicle for the second time ever I stopped in and test drove the redesigned 2007 Wrangler. I was impressed from start to finish - 5 inches wider, really well refined, so much more room and interior features. The body is bigger and tougher looking. Don't get me wrong it does not ride like a car but with the improvement in comfort from the TJ to JK I fell in love with it and drove my Jeep off the show room floor that day!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The on-road drive is Wrangler's best... the off-road driver is even better. I waited 2 weeks before hitting the trails. I out performed a friend in his TJ (no lockers). We did some crawling, some mudding, and a bit of a mix. while in a mud pit, I pulled out a Grand Cherokee. Definitely better than Toyota's FJ Cruiser. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ESP is very impressive if you don't have lockers. From my videos, I see little tire slip as a result of ESP. Wider stance protects you better from a roll over even at a 40 degrees side ways incline... much better than the previous model (TJ). The 3-piece freedom top is pretty cool. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It's been a week now since we picked up our new Unlimited X. Got the hardtop, picked the white with black top. People are getting whiplash just checking it out going down the road. It's fun to drive, it's quiet, didn't even realize I was doing 60 in a 45mph zone! The 7 speaker stereo system with Sirius Radio is unbelievable. This has to be the most fun vehicle I've had in years & I'm a gray spiky haired ol' beach broad in my 50's! It was well worth the 3 month wait for a white one with a hardtop!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned 2 previous Wranglers and by far this one is the best off the showroom floor I have ever seen. The interior is more spacious, comfortable, and quieter. The new 3 piece hard top is great and is easy to take off and put back on. One my favorite views of this Jeep is the rear, with the new hardtop it has a very mean look. I took it off road this past weekend for the first time and had other Wrangler owners in amazement at its capabilities. I am also very surprised that I am averaging over 20 miles to the gallon! I would highly suggest this vehicle to anyone who is looking for a fun vehicle with improved practicality!</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far I must say I'm happy with my new '07 Wrangler 4 door, but a little concerned. The incorporation of 4 doors sold me. The ride is not as rough and bumpy as one would expect. Handles just fine on the highway and I've gotten 19-20 MPG on the highway. The only concern I have is the quality. I've owned mine for 2 months and issues have begun to arise. The rubber pads on the hood keep falling off. Most worrisome, on 2 occasions while driving all the sudden the dash lights come on, the motor cuts out, and it completely stalls...it restart and regains power within 5 seconds. Sometimes when I unlock the doors with the keyless remote, the radio starts playing on its own. I'm worried. :(</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>07 wrangler by Bob</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Our previous Jeep was a 98 Wrangler SE with four-cylinder, 5 speed manual. The new critter is six-cylinder with a six-speed. Ironically, the highway mileage we're getting is better by far at 70 mph than the four-banger got. This Jeep is also quieter with full doors with roll up windows. So far we have had no problems. Lots of plastic on the interior, but it's washable so who cares. Plastic cladding over the bumpers is a bit un-Jeep, but everything else is pretty rugged. Sixteen inch wheels are also a plus. We found with the old Jeep that tall skinny tires work best in snow. That is also the experience with the '07 as well. Just go with factory wheels. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>More side to side interior room. Quieter soft top. Lower rpm in most gears than the old jeep ran at. Smoother running on the highway. Disc brakes all around are a plus. Suspension is much better. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wow. It's been 6 days and I am still in heaven. The Jeep Wrangler 4 door will go down in history as one of the best things to ever come from DC/Jeep. The 2007 Wrangler (4 door) rides high and comfortable. Entry and exit is something you may need to practice, but I have owned three Jeeps now and it keeps getting better. My one and only negative is that the upward (looking towards traffic lights) visibility is limited with the top on. My Jeep steers true and gets plenty of looks. The gas mileage is low, but again I have owned three Jeeps. The interior space/design is awesome. Plenty of room for 5 adults and a dog! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Well after 9k miles and several trips off road and I still LOVE my Jeep. It performs flawlessly off-road. Just like the "old Jeeps." As far problems, I have had two strange occurrences. Once I lost all power while driving 45 mph. The Jeep cut off for about 5 seconds then restarted (mileage 2k). The second was my traction control like came on to indicate a failure. I had both issues checked. Jeep said the power thing was not a known issue and it has not reoccurred. The EPS light issue went away but Jeep did say they have had some issues with a sensor for the braking unit. They ordered me a new one but I haven't got it in and the problem hasn't reoccurred.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first time to purchase a Wrangler tuned out to be the greatest. I drove a new 2006 and two new 07s; one stick and one auto, purchased the stick. A Jeep to me should only be a stick. What a nice vehicle, the 07 tops seem much tighter on the vehicle than the 06. Plenty of power with the new V6 and the tranny is smooth, German manufacturer I think.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The favorite features is that it is not priced much higher than a Kawasaki Mule once you load up one of those. The Jeep obviously has much more capability. I like the ease at which everything is available to the driver. Carpeted interior is real quiet even with soft top. </FAVORITE>

We live at the top of a steep hill in the Blue Ridge Mountains and this with its torque and auto transmission will get her up and down with little effort.

<TEXT>I have always wanted to own a Jeep Wrangler, but being married with a child we needed more room. Then came the four door Wrangler. It was love at first sight! Then the test drive sealed the deal. We purchased the Wrangler with the soft top with a plan to purchase a hard top later. After a drive home from the coast with high winds, very little road noise made us change our plans on the hard top. The soft top will do fine. We are getting around 19 miles to the gallon with a lot of in town driving. We have taken it in the snow and love the traction that a jeep provides in snow and ice conditions. The only problem I have had is getting the keys away from my wife.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As an owner of two Wranglers, I was skeptical about this redesign. One drive and I was convinced it's still a Jeep and better than ever! It's beefier, wider, quieter, more comfortable, more powerful and sturdier than my previous Wranglers. First 250 miles indicated 21 MPG -- great for a Wrangler and during a 250 mile trip the seats and ride were firm but comfortable, very little wind noise from the new cloth top or around the doors and the radio with 7 speakers excellent. The new engine pulls strong and the 6 speed shifts very direct. Overall a home run for the Jeep folks! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the new Jeep. This is my 3rd one I've had (94,01,07). They're hard to find in dual tops right now but I don't think you need a hard top unless you're in a climate that is predominately cold. Here in New Jersey I will get more use out of the soft top that the hard top. Even with the Targa feature, the hard top is a menace on those "Indian summer days". There is virtually no noise with the soft top up on the highway. I had my Sahara up to 80 and I was having a normal conversation (no yelling like the old soft tops). Chrysler really did a good job on the soft top design. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The new Jeep really rides tight and is elevated, more that the TJ was. The power windows, locks, and entry is still hard to get use to on a Jeep but it's nice to join the 21st century automotively speaking. The stereo is finally worthy of mention. Definitely go with the subwoofer.</FAVORITE>

To my surprise and delight there is now a 2007 Jeep Wrangler X Unlimited parked in my driveway. The four doors, longer wheel base and wider stance are all real attention grabbers. I have been approached several times by people wanting to take a look and ask questions. The drive is comfortable visibility is great. I won't be winning any races down at the track but that was not the point of buying a Jeep. I am looking forward for some cross-country traveling next month and I will try and submit a report on how that goes as well. </TEXT>

It's a lot of fun to drive and can really hang the corners without feeling like it's going to roll over. It also pulls my boats just fine and is very stable. I don't feel the Jeep getting pushed around by the trailer like some smaller trucks tend to do. The take off power seemed a bit lacking but turning off the ESP seems to cure that, but this could just all be in my head because I like this ride so much.</TEXT>

I have put 1200 miles on it in the last month. The only thing I want to do is to add all of the fun aftermarket accessories, like air horns, my CB, and some fun spotlights. I got an almost fully-loaded X model, with a soft top, and 6 disc DVD player. I have already removed the doors (all 4), and gone on the highway. I've had three of my friends in the back, and they were comfortable. With mostly city driving so far, I am getting 16 mpg.

<TEXT>It is bigger and more comfortable on the road. Compared to my 04 Xterra this rides a little better. It actually takes the bumps instead of being pounded. The 7 speaker stereo is great and I love the hardtop and all the ways it can be configured. It still looks like a Jeep that has leaped into the future. Compared to the X I had this is a power monster. It is just me and my wife so I can take out the backseat and put a lot of gear in here for a little trip. I have not had mine off road yet either but I do not think that is going to be an issue with this Jeep. This is a great Jeep and the boys at Jeep ought to be proud of this one.

After several test drives, and permission from my wife (she is critical of vehicles too), I was able to find one with all of the features I wanted. This vehicle handles great (100% improvement from my other Jeeps), it sits well in corners, and has plenty of leg room. I am 6'5, and have no issues with room.

<TEXT>My wife and I were looking for a newer vehicle to replace her 2006 Toyota Corolla. We needed something more practical for the environment that we live in. Being in Utah, where we have the mountains and the desert, along with the frigid, blowing snows of winter to the arid, hot summer days, we needed a vehicle that was capable of getting us around at any time of the year. The 2007 Wrangler four door unlimited was possibly the best choice for all of our needs. It gets better mileage than our Suburban, has more passenger and cargo room than the Corolla, and better highway capability than my old 1965 CJ5. Thus far, this is the better model of Jeep. I cannot imagine anything better than this.</TEXT>

I have a soft top and have mastered its removal (about 2,5 minutes), but putting it on takes a little longer. I am very happy and look forward to years of driving. The down side is its lack of acceleration and low miles per gallon. I am glad I bought it and recommend one for anyone who wants to have a little fun while driving. It is not a really comfortable car, make your second car the comfortable one. When you live up north, way, way up north, give me reliability over comfort anytime.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Jeep. I drove my first one for seven years. I needed a larger vehicle with more space because of children. The new 4 door was just what I was looking for. The new v-6 is nice, but I would still like a V- 8. The ride quality and quietness of the new Jeep is much better that the previous year models.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the 4 doors. The unlimited also has a considerable increase in cargo capacity which is a plus.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As a mom of 3, I insisted my husband buy this Jeep! It is the only convertible on the market that has 3 seat belts in the back seat. It wouldn't be a great every day car for me and the kids, but when it is a day at the beach--LOOK OUT!! Throw your boards in and who cares about the sand--its a Jeep! It's fun and makes me feel young. Living in southern California means the Jeep is topless all year long.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this a while back and we just got rid of it because of all the problems we had with it. Transmission jumped from gear to gear, roof leaked, door rattled excessively. Just because it's a "Jeep" doesn't mean they can put out crap. Pros - handled well in the snow with good traction and decent mpg if you drafted semis.</TEXT>

<TEXT>While I am new to the Jeep Wrangler World, I am a veteran of other Jeep models (which I LOVED). When I got into the Wrangler 4 door it was purely a question of lust. It looks GOOD. Alas, I live in Miami, it's rare that I can take the top off (shocking yes) because you either bake, scorch or get soaked. Once that fact finally sunk in, I realized I had bought a box on wheels. If you want 0-60 in decent time, get in someone else's car. If you drive off a cliff, don't worry, the aerodynamics (HA!) are SO bad, you'll stop mid-air. It's very good looking, easy to modify, but horrid to drive on a daily basis in the urban outdoors. You're better off with an XTerra.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very pleased to be a owner of my Jeep. It is fun to ride and has many looks (top half-way off, all the way off, doors off, or just take it all off!). I never knew about the Wrangler family but as soon as I started driving I quickly found out. The four doors have great space and handles well. As for gas (gas is just to high to even say anything good about that) but it's ok. The hard doors with electric is the way to go. I have a soft top and wind is still a little issue but not that bad (will soon get a hard top). But over all very happy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My '97 Wrangler was stolen and I was forced to buy another SUV after a decade of loving my first Jeep. Boy am I glad I rented a car for months waiting for this Jeep to show up in CA. I loved my Jeep and it was tough to lose it, but my pain disappeared almost instantly once I test drove the '07 Wrangler Unlimited Sahara. I was hooked. It was far fancier. I never thought I would get into the comforts of this upgraded model, but they are easy to get used to. Four doors are awesome and extra cargo...I needed all along. Everyone that drives in my Jeep loves it. After a year I am still in the infatuation stage. Jeep did right on this one. Here's to another decade, or much longer I hope!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth and quiet ride, yet highly capable offroad; more room, perfect balance and not too big; interior is very nice, yet still a Jeep; upgraded sound is very good; flexible seats and configurations; Jeep's awesome good looks of Wrangler and guys stop me all the time to ask about it!

<TEXT>My wife insisted that I buy this vehicle and it has definitely improved my image! It is well appointed with the Freedom Top and 18 inch wheels and is fun to drive. I added wheel locks, a spare tire cover and the heavy duty floor mats. Have had no drivability problems to date (6800 miles) and a only one recall involving a brake module. There are no water leaks with the top, however, when entering or exiting the vehicle in a rain, water will drip into the cabin. There is an air whistle which I can't seem to locate. The brake pads had to be serviced at 2000 miles due to "glazing." I have achieved up to 22 mpg with the auto which for a vehicle of this design seems reasonable. Happy so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased the new 07 instead of buying used because I wanted the 3-piece Freedom Top. I have not been disappointed - it's SO easy and the panels fit in back with seat folded up! I keep the panels wrapped in blankets when not on, and I have never had a leak. Acceleration and power can be problematic on any SUVs, but this is just fine IF you know how to drive it. I have left a Camaro in the dust right off a stoplight. Handles beautifully in all weather. I've never had the stall complaints other people have. A few recalls (normal for a new model!) and dealer fixed everything. Read the EPA estimates BEFORE you buy a Jeep and complain about gas mileage, by the way.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Freedom Top! Even the basic sound system rocks out, and everything inside held up great when I got DRENCHED in a storm. Better than my 01 Wrangler X- steering, suspension, etc. So many ways to personalize if you buy the basic model and get a JCW catalog! Ooh, and removable cup holder liners, good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Really, really like the Jeep idea - the wife hates it, however. This is my 3rd (I think). The 4dr is surprisingly comfortable (vs. earlier Jeeps). Similar to other posts, I have had annoying RUST on various (hopefully) insignificant parts of the Jeep. I feel just like I bought a 1970 something CJ. Worse - the dealers want to "take photos" for evaluation at HQ. Wimps. I also had the clutch replaced earlier this year (4K miles). Yikes. The only thing that is worse is that I'm honestly thinking of selling my silver 07 (with 5K miles) and buying a black 08. Why? So the rust does not show as fast! I'll probably always have a Jeep - no matter how poorly they are made! Sick, isn't it?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've really enjoyed this vehicle. Plenty of space, good fuel economy for an SUV, and one of the only SUVs available in a manual transmission. Four door convertible in the summer is certainly fun, and the hard tops have improved (ease of use/installation as well as reduced leaks, squeaks, etc.). Great in the snow and ice, and the longer wheelbase and new suspension make it comfortable (not luxurious) on long road trips. Underpowered (needs something larger than the 3.8) at elevation but with a manual you can certainly get by. No maintenance issues to date (~1 year and 12k miles). Overall, lots of fun. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven my Rubicon through mud pits, up 50 degree slops, up rock banks after driving through rivers and almost nothing has stopped it. It's gas mileage is miserable compared to my old BMW. I get around 15 miles to the gallon, yet it's well worth the trade considering the hauling ability. Removing the back seat I was hauling 70 pumpkins in the back and putting my friends F-250 to shame. The reliability is amazing as well, and it is extremely easy to change the oil and do minor work. I love putting all the Hummer owners to shame when they realize they spent 15,000 more on a vehicle nowhere near as good as my Rubicon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Excellent performance on/off road. Problems: 1.) No where to mount CB radio for off- road communications. This is major design flaw. 2.) On dry paved city streets, ESP and Sway Bar will activate for no apparent reason. May or may not deactivate even when motor is restarted. Occurs frequently in hot AZ weather. 3.) Annoying squeal from left front wheel. Dealer can't identify. Most noticeable at low speeds (10 mph and less). Other than 3 items noted, vehicle is fantastic. Solid performer on the trail and comfortable for long road trips with family. Would buy another one in an instant. </TEXT>

<TEXT>To make a long story short...this vehicle has been a nightmare. Drove it off the lot with 3 miles on it and had immediate problems. Have taken it to 4 different Chrysler/Jeep dealers and only a few problems have been fixed on it...mainly TSB's & recalls. Chrysler will not help and the dealerships have outright refused to fix my car. Needless to say, this is illegal. The list of problems now consists of 35 line entries...bad clutch, rough shifting, broken seatbelts, pourous soft top, leaking hard top, high-pitched shrieking sounds, dead horn, fluctuating stereo volume, and the list goes on & on. Although a very cool vehicle, customer service & mechanical assistance is unacceptable!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Keep in mind, I?m single and this is my only vehicle. Got my Jeep back in July. Almost 6500 miles on it. Fun ride that definitely turns heads. I do get the mini Hummer comment a lot. Hard top takes two people to get it off (back portion.) I continue to have problems with a leak anytime it rains. Drips right down on the dashboard and then onto the radio. Supposedly been fixed by dealership but by the sound of everyone else, there is no fix. When starting it seems to stick sometimes. Recently got a recall about my brakes. This Jeep will suck gas. I get about 16 mpg. On the interstate I get around 19-20. No power! Love driving it in the summer and look forward to next year already. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This thing is just too much fun. Everything is better than I expected. Longer wheelbase gives it a smoother ride than I expected, the interior is quieter than I expected, and the millage is even slightly better than I expected. The power is what I expected. In low range it will climb anything, and it will easily tow a Toyota FJ out of the mud that you just crossed. On the street, however, you are going to get beat across the light by a Chevette. This thing has been everywhere, up mountain trails, in mud up to the frame, over rocks and boulders, and even stuck in downtown traffic, and it has never disappointed us. Had a great summer, now I can?t wait to get it into the snow. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an excellent offroad vehicle that transitions onto the road very nicely. If it is you and one other person the two door is perfect and has plenty of room for gear. Offroad capabilites are outstanding. The freedom top is great and have had no problems with any leakage since buying it and I remove the top all of the time and wash with a power washer. There is lots of power as long as you know how to drive a stick. Gas mileage is better than expected with 19.5 average city driving and I've gotten up to 23 mpg on the highway. 4-low is a beast! No hill is to steep, no trail to rough, and it is still as quiet as when I first bought it almost six months ago. </TEXT>

Really nice stereo on my sahara unlimited version. Storage is good. I have a family of 5 with one in a child seat. We can all fit and have room in the back for our gear. On the negative- I have the hard tops and they leak, 4 trips to the dealership for the 'water doctor' and they can't get it straight- 28K is too much for a vehicle that drips water on you . Starter sticks and blinckers will sometimes not disengage. Only 5k and lots of squeeks and rattles. Brakes squeak loudly</TEXT>

The door locks automatically lock when you put the vehicle in drive but only the drivers door unlocks automatically after being placed in park.

<TEXT>The first thing I did with this vehicle is install a fresh air intake, a cat back dual exhaust system and a jet chip. This vehicle needs to come stock with at least a 260hp engine in it. I have boosted this engine up to around 235hp but it still drags in sixth gear on an up hill run. Also only offering two rear end ratios is a crime. Mine has the 3.21 in it and that is to high and it still only gets about 19mpg. A mid range of around 3.51 would help. I have already decided to get my next one with the automatic transmission and the trailer towing package. A small diesel would also be nice, something with a good torque rating. All in all this is the best jeep I have ever driven or owned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I liked my Jeep when I first bought it. They look great, but are not very practical. The interior scratches up very easily. I couldn't get my soft top to fit, so I scheduled 2 different appointments and left it with them all day. To keep my interior from being ruined, I had the hard top put back on. Now the roof leaks any time you take it through a car wash or it rains hard. There isn't any touch up paint for the hard top if it's needed. It will scratch easily esp when taking it off the veh. In the heat, the sealant melts and drips a tar-like substance, which will stain the interior. My advice: Buy something a little more practical. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I upgraded from a '89 Wrangler to the '07 with the 6 speed, S-package, freedom top, tow package, rear locker, swaybar disconect, 17" wheel/tire package. The ride is great, the engine is responsive with the 6-speed and 4.10 gears. Gas mileage isn't great, I have been averaging about 18 mpg which is what the sticker said it would get. The seats are comfortable, the height adjustable drivers seat is a nice feature. I really like the removable hard top panels, it takes less time to remove and replace these than it did to put up and down my soft top. I have had it off-road and with the rear locker and swaybar diconnects it performed great. The disconnect really smoothed the ride out. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle looks great, and I bought it 6 months ago, it has 7,000 miles on it. Good cornering and acceleration. The transmission was replaced. I drove it through a touchless car wash, and water came into the interior. Cannot get in and out of back seat with ease. Interior panels and paint scratch easily. A recall exists for many '07 Wranglers, per NHTSA. Mine was not included in the recall, therefore, I was never informed. But my vehicle stalled out for the same reason as the recall while I was driving 55MPH in the rain. Soft top windows scratch easily. Noisy and cumbersome driving. Well priced, but a huge disappointment overall for me.</TEXT>

The gas mileage is OK and we tow a 16 foot ATV trailer on weekends OK. We finally got the recall for the stalling in the mail and hopefully that will be solved as it was pretty bad on the highway for the last year losing all power for a few seconds then restarting with no help from Chrysler.

Great ride, great time, 18in wheels, tow pkg. Only drawback was I ordered a Rubicon and after 4 months, was told I would have to wait another 3 months, so I built a Sahara as close to a Rubi as I could get. It has so much room and is actually bigger then my Cherokee Sport. I love the looks I get and the comments from folks. If the gas mileage was better it would be perfect. I'm still very, very happy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6sSpeed stick. Freedom top. I've driven with the driver and passenger's side off many times. Split seat. 7 speaker sound system. Ipod aux input jack. Awesome 4wd handling. Great look and terrific paint!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 2007 Wrangler is hardly underpowered. In fact, the V6 with six speed manual and 4.10 rear end is an excellent cruiser and can't be touched off road. When I want to go quickly, I drive my 2006 Hemi Grand Cherokee. The hard top on my Wrangler Sahara Unlimited is trouble a makes for a very quiet ride. The MyGig system is by far the best in technology for navigation and sound system. Lots of room and a comfortable ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely love my new Wrangler 4 Door Sahara package. The only trouble I have had so far is when I took the hard top off and put it back on and went to the car wash, it sometimes leaks. You have to be very careful with the weatherstripping or it leaks, and I have had the water blow through the doors edges. There has to be a better system to keep the water out at high pressure. Engine could use a little more pep. I'm averaging 18.5 MPG. It only has about 2500 miles right now, so it may need more break in time. I bought all the chrome accessories and get tons of compliments. Headed to my first Jeep Jamboree..so we'll see how that goes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the new dash style with the compass and temerature. I wish they had more colors, but my Red Rock is pretty in the sun. I like how you can make the driver's seat lift up and the three piece hard top is very nice too. Infinity stereo is also nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This jeep is a lot of fun but the quality of the jeep is crap. I hope this is because it's the first year.... Roof leaks hard and soft tops. Hinges corrode and rust on the doors, visible in the cracks of the hinges and eventually the paint on the hinges. Interior plastic scratches very easy with a fingernail...and I mean very easy!. The new motor is a bit underpowered for a 4dr but liveable. Hey it's a 4x4 but you'd think a V6 would get better fuel economy than 15- 19...v8's are getting better mileage than this 6. It's a blast to drive with the top off or on, it's can climb a wall. I hope the new Chrysler takes note and fixes the issues with the 08 model.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This handles extremely well on and off- road, though it does lean more as an Off-Road vehicle. I don't buy the "SUV" title it is given, I call it an ORV or Off-Road Vehicle. C'mon it is a jeep! If you never plan to take the doors off, tops off and get muddy inside and out, don't you dare think of getting one. If you never plan on letting your Jeep taste dirt, mud, and stone, get dings dents scratches all over it-don't buy one, or you will be disappointed. If you want a luxury SUV then buy one, but don't buy a Jeep, it is "comfortable" while you bounce around on potholes rocks and mud, but it wasn't designed to stay clean, detailed and comfy. It is rugged and mean. I mean its a Jeep a true ORV</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned my 2007 Unlimited Rubicon for 60 days now and I love it! Offroad this thing is King. Everyone is amazed how well it rides on the street and trail. The automatic is geared a little high (so get the 4:10 gears) but gets 22-23mpg on the highway. The best part of this Jeep is the space and family sized comfort. It's definitely a "Jeep" interior, and everything is manual regarding the tops. But it is so much fun! I've taken it to the beach 3 times so far, and I've got 2 weeks coming up. Many new safety features have made this thing safer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Only owned it for a month but, love it, except for one thing. Fun to drive and so many cool things you can do to it. Very smooth drive. They've improved a lot. However, a very annoying feature that I didn't discover until after my purchase. They apparently did away with the passenger seat feature that allowed it to pop up and foward making entry into the back seat easy. Now it's very difficult to get in the back seat. My kids just climb over now. If you're an adult, forget about it! Jeep really needs to rethink that change. Gas mileage has improved but, definitely more room for improvement.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This one has so much room--6'4" and plenty of elbow and leg room--up one weight class from the old body type. The standard shift is smooth and road friendly. Several GSP runs to NYC with comfort and performance all the way. If you keep it under 2000rpms, mileage in 6th gear is very good. The S package, Sunrider top and the 17" wheel options are the way to order this X-model. This Jeep is light years better than my '98 Cherokee 5 speed. There are no quality issues. The V-6 mates perfectly with the 6 speed. The paint, body fit and mechanicals are all German improvements over the last body type. No leaks with the big Sunrider soft top</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had a 2000 Wrangler and loved it without question. I like this 2007 a lot as far as features go but build quality has proven to be bad. The Jeep has been back to the dealer 6 times now for things that shouldn't have left the factory: doors adjusted improperly, water leaks at top of doors, missing drain plug in floor (water leak again), rear window zipper defective on first try, fender flare not installed properly, etc. Since Jan. I have been without my new vehicle for about 25 days for repairs. Am seriously looking at a trade since it develops new issues every other week, but lemon law hasn't been met. </TEXT>

I have two children and can finally drive my beloved Wrangler without making every outing uncomfortable for my family. This thing has tons of cargo space and leg room, the freedom top is great - just pop off the front tops and you can feel like you are in an open air Wrangler and still feel good about having the kids in the back. The ride is smoother than older models and is amazingly quiet. The stereo system is something Jeep should be proud of as well! The only drawback is the gas mileage but the fun factor makes it worth it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having driven various models of the Mustang over the past 10 years I was a little worried that I might be too use to a sports car and would regret buying the Wrangler...not at all. Obviously, the ride is a bit different, but the 2007 Wrangler rides a lot better than any other Jeep I have ever ridden in. The build quality is classic Jeep and I am getting 17.3 MPG on average (not bad for what this vehicle can do). It seems to me that the only complaints most people mention have to do with features that make the Wrangler a Wrangler and not a Lexus. Sure, the doors don't stay open, but that is because they were made to be removed, etc. Best 4WD vehicle out there...by far.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the look (mine is Rescue Green). People stare at it wherever I go. The off-road ability is legendary and I can't wait for the snow. Having a 4-door, 4x4, convertible is just plain cool. The Ininity stereo system has much better sound than I ever expected. It's a Jeep.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm on my 4th Wrangler, and so far, I'm not overly impressed with the reliability of my Wrangler or the build quality. It has spent 2 solid weeks in the shop since march, and will be going in again this week for more horrible noises coming from the engine compartment. Besides that, the offroad abilities far surpass my previous Wranglers, even past Rubicons. On road, the 07 has much better road manners, though it's still going to be a bit squirrly from the short wheelbase. Engine power is lacking a bit. Could use about 20 more horses or so. Transmission is smooth (I have the 6 speed). I live in Denver, and maybe that is why it seems sluggish. Compared to the 4 litre, it's a bit weak.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Redesigned in and out, nicer audio system, I dig the new BFG mud terrains instead of the Goodyears. Electric Sway bar disconnects are very convienent, and of course, off road capabilities that cannot be surpassed by any other vehicle!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in my Tacoma Truck for the Wrangier. Been a good ride so far except for a faulty ground in the first 1000 miles. Once fixed it has been a good ride. Only complaints are the hardtop to softtop instructions are vague. Soft-top is very snug and hard to manuver into closed position. DVD option is the dumbest design and poor planning. Jeep tried to used radio from other vehicles not thinking through the screen concept. Only option is to get built in headrest screen but that isn't practical with soft-top (theft).

<TEXT>We traded in our Tahoe for the 4 dr Jeep and I've had some trouble getting used to the loss of luxury. I know we bought it as a fun car, but in this day and age, every vehicle should come standard with power mirrors and power seats. And what about the small things like mirrors on the visor? Plus there are no pockets on the back seats so pretty much everything you put in the car flies out if you don't have the hard top on. Which is what makes the vehicle fun...no hard top. We purchased this car for our children and dogs and thought it would be a good practical car. I just think they could have made this a little more kid friendly and a little less man friendly. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am in love with the overall design of this vehicle. I considered myself lucky to find a Rubicon in dealer inventory so soon, and in my haste, I bought it. It is a very functional vehicle with lots of thought given to offroad enthusiasts. Within 2 days of purchase, I took it offroad and "broke it in" and I have been happy with it for the most part. While this Jeep rides very well with 32" tall mud tires and is pretty quiet, the power is seriously lacking. The hood lifts when rigs pass at highway speeds. The engine randomly stalls. I submitted my complaint to NHTSA. Hopefully they will pressure DCX to come up with a resolution and get us fixed.</TEXT>

Ride quality is great, seats are comfortable (did take a four hour cruise to see family already and the trip was easy as can be). Steering is responsive, no "roll" feeling in corners, very nimble. Enging is good, not great but I've been plenty happy with acceleration, passing, cruising, etc. Interior is extremely roomy for a Jeep. Plenty of cargo room.

<TEXT>The four door Jeep Wrangler is a fun vehicle to own and drive. The power is OK and if you keep your foot out of the gas it is not too bad MPG. Ours has the hardtop and it has never leaked as some have said. You do have to put it on a certain way or I could see how it could leak. The only complaint is that it does stall at highway speeds sometimes as many new 2007 Jeep products have with no fix available from Chrysler yet. Hopefully the government investigation will help get this dangerous problem fixed before it causes someone to get hurt.</TEXT>

It performs quite well now w/ my 33's and the stock 4.10 gearing that come with the Auto. Even the X model is very capable on the trail after numerous outings now. For the interior: the seats are fairly comfortable and modern. However, the dash is hard not to scratch when cleaning dust/dirt; the glove box and center console lock as well as rear floor cargo storage by locking rear swing door. The soft top is definitely quieter than previous models and it secures better around the doors. The headlights and fog lights are improved.</TEXT>

The new Wrangler is an improvement of a proven product line, and it gives me the capabilities I am looking for. Frankly, if you don't want a Jeep why bother with the other SUV's? They are simply cars with lower mileage and no performance in rough conditions. My only complaint is there is no diesel engine option, but thats true for the rest of the manufacturers too.
