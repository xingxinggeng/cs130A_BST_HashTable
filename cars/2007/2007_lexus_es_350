<TEXT>First Lexus. Great exterior look with sun and moon roof. Poor exterior paint quality and interior quality not what I expected for a Lexus. Tires did not last as expected. Overall, few problems just a little disappointing. Nav of little use- maps not up to date and system not user friendly.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior look, comfort in ride. Keyless remote entry, back up camera.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first Lexus. Very comfortable and quiet. Great fuel economy 23/31 for a large, comfortable car. Quality design. Disappointed in the thin paint, rock chips are very noticeable and the Michelin tires won't make 30,000. Large ugly mirrors to compensate for the thick roof supports. The wireless voice commands don't always do voice recognition. Expected more for $40K. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable ride, quiet, short turning radius and great gas economy for a large car. Interior and exterior fob recognition (puddle lights). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned several ES in the past, but this is the first with GPS. I agree it is not up to par with the competition and I have been test driving many vehicles over the past couple of months. The voice command response is terrible and not worth the effort. Blue tooth has been fine. Biggest complaint is that GPS does not allow even a passenger to enter info while the car is in motion. Very frustrating as voice commands for navigation are not worth the effort. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort. Quiet. Smooth ride. Great dealerships and sales people.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this Lexus and was SO pleased. I got it as a certified pre owned. It is a great quality car. As usual, Lexus and Toyota are ahead of the game. I strongly recommend this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Pretty car. Great for long trips. Loud clicking in the engine until it warms. Taken to dealer several times and they report that it the noise is normal. However, loaner cars do not make that noise. Car has several rattling noises and is poorly insulated from road noise. Poor thigh support. Poor rear vision. Love the keyless entry. Love the large trunk. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the third Lexus overall and two in the family at once. One is an RX 350 for the mountains and snow days and the ES 350 is for everything else. The vehicle is all class. Easy on the wallet, and good gas mileage. I tried the Acura and traded it in on the ES 350 after less than one year. The ES gives me the comfort and power I want in a vehicle. I have never been back to the dealership for anything but standard maintenance service with the RX or the ES and both are 07s.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is not my first Lexus and the only problem is the car has developed squeaks and rattles, sounds like the whole panel has a body flex when going over bumps. The whole panel behind and in roof sounds as if it is bending and making a terrible noise. It has been back to dealer and they have replaced seat and other parts still the same noise rattles/vibrates when I turn. I have stopped using the car 7,000 km in the last year used to be over 20,000 km. Great performance. I have only used premium and it returns great gas mileage. It takes several tries for the voice-recognition system to work. I will most likely go back to Infiniti.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned a Benz, Cadi Allante, Buick, too many to mention including a Subaru and this car is built, looks great and has not given me any problems whatsoever. The fuel economy, while taking premium, runs circles around most cars. 33+ on the open road, average around town over 22. I am not sure I would even think of trading it in on anything else. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Was more interested in buying the Benz E350 but with a starting price tag of 52K i decided to check out the ES 350 after a friend had let me drive one. It was instant love and the rest is history. My car is not a little over 1 year old and I still love it like the day I drove of the lot. More than enough power to pass on the beltway and comfort like no other car for those long trips. Got the upgraded model with the Panorama roof and Mark Levinson system, well getting me out of this car is hard, believe that . </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great sound system Mark Levinson, love the safety features, the self dimming mirrors and great headlight system and awesome GPS nav system </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm very comfortable in my ES 350. Smooth, quiet ride. Nav system is great. Sound system is pretty good but could be better. Love my back up camera. Only complaint is that I can't seem to get climate controls to a perfect temp for me, but LOVED the air conditioned seats this summer -- keeps you from sticking to leather, ladies. This is my second ES and I'd recommend it for someone who wants luxury but can't afford or doesn't want to spend the extra for a better Mercedes or BMW. My husband has complained about the voice recognition but it's just operator error. Overall, I love it. Got a great color, too, Amber Pearl and people compliment it all the time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I agree with a writer's assessment about noises, poor highway handling and the so-so radio. The important problem is the highway handling. At 60 to 65 mph and above, the car seems to have a wobble, and the steering wheel actually shakes. I am still working with a dealer to fix this. From day 3 of owning the car I have had noises, creaks, rattles, whatever inside. Most of the dashboard noise has been fixed now, but other noises are coming from pillars or doors. I drive a lot, so the problems are very disappointing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Until I get to 60, the ride is great. The inside and outside looks great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A smooth, comfortable ride, without sacrificing too much in the way of handling. Coming from a BMW convertible, I miss the sharp cornering, but I love the smooth quiet ride. Much better on the freeway. The premium stereo is all anyone needs. Plays mp3 disks, so with 6 disks, you can load about 1000 songs at one time. Nav system works like a charm.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is everything you can ask of a comfortable luxury sedan: quiet, roomy, fast (0-60 in 6.8 sec), safe (12 airbags, traction control, stability control), comfortable w/luxury touches all over (smart key, real walnut wood trims, air cooled seats). All of this at a cost in the mid $30s with the gas mileage ratings unmatched by anything in its class. It is also the most reliable manufacturer as rated by Consumer Report Magazine. My wife and I had this car for over a month and we are very happy with it - it provided everything we expected and more. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smart key, air conditioned ventilated seats, automatic lights which turn on & off based on ambient light condition (this feature keeps you from forgetting to turn on your headlights - this happens often w/led dashboard such as on this car).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I owned an ES 300 from the mid 90s and loved it. I have owned an ES 350 for 6 months and am less excited about it. The seats are uncomfortable and it feels very small for a person who is over six feet tall. Having said this, I think it will be a very reliable car, because I do believe Lexus is all about quality. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my ES 350 since 08/06. I picked the Ultra package with every available option, including the radar crash protection. It was worth the extra expense. The higher end leather is the plushest. The custom wheels add an extra dazzle. The ride is firm and compliant - not the best on corners. I couldn't be happier. My only complaints are: 1) I wanted the Sirius option and as of now my dealer says that it isn't available, but likely will be in the near future. 2) The touch button controls on the nav. system/phone system are mostly dimmed out (unworkable) when the car is in motion. Very annoying and inconvenient. 3) The bluetooth phone system has a tunnel sound.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the options! The Nav. system is the best around. The ultra leather seats are super to sit in. The heat/cool seats are effective. Parking assist & back up camera are very helpful and never annoying.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove several competitors during my search. Once I test drove the Lexus ES 350 the search was over. I had owned Lexus cars in the past and thought I would prefer a sportier car like the BMW however after test driving the new ES 350 I knew this was the car I wanted to drive each day to work and around town. The ES 350 provides an excellent combination of efficiency and luxury. On the efficiency side the car gets great gas mileage while having 272 HP. In addition the cost of the car is reasonable. As for luxury the car is plush with superior quality in terms comfort and ergonomics. The ride is extremely quite.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The MP3 auxiliary jack for your iPod is awesome. The leather seats are extremely comfortable. Other favs are push button start, keyless entry, gas mileage and horsepower</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought ES 350 after driving much of the competition. I drove this one last and quickly realized the car was ar superior to the others. It it truly luxuriuos. The leather is so soft and comfortable. The interior is high quality, with the exception of a few cheap plastic items, such as the coin & sunglass holders, etc. Drive & steering is very smooth - the other cars I test drove weren't even close. An unbelievable amount of options on this car and technology out of this world. Sports-car like power, but corners fast poorly. Quiet drive under 55. Smooth styling. Nav. well worth the money. I love cars have owned many nice ones. This is my favorite yet.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Entry - just grab handle to open doors and touch button on trunk to open; push button start/stop; voice activation for stereo, climate control, phone, nav; bluetooth; aux mp3 player input; rearview camera; touch screen navigation; white lighting; auto wipers; moving headlights; vent. seats; soft leather; mem. seats</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car came with defects that Lexus won't fix. Seats are very uncom- fortable. Thin people bottom on on the seats supporting wires. Inadequate foam was used in the seats. Who placed the wiper stalk- you can't see it while driving. Auto lights keep turning dash lights on and off at dusk. Handling is poor at highway speed. Stereo is only fair. Horrible center storage. Minimal storage. Interior plastics are poor quality. Voice activated bluetooth doesn't like zeros. The car has rattled since day one. Poor quality interior carpets.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased this fantastic car on 9/26/2006. What you immediately notice is how quiet the car is. Once you start to drive the car, you will marvel at the incredibly smooth ride. The car glides down the road as if it were on a cushion of air! The steering is quick giving the car a surprisingly agile feel. Maybe the IS 350 was meant to be the sportier car, but the ES 350 is no slouch! The car is quite fast off-the-line. The seats are extremely comfortable. If you like being pampered at an affordable price, this car is definitely for you. My wife chose the "Golden Almond Metallic" color and it looks terrific in the sun. Haven't met anyone who doesn't like this color once they see it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the handsfree bluetooth phone controls. The voice recognition system works perfectly. The sound through the speakers is clear and the other party can hear me very well. I'm using a Treo 700wx with the car without any problems.</FAVORITE>

I started to buy IS 250 but I am glad I bought the ES 350 because it has more interior room inside car and more space in trunk. It also has smoother ride and acceleration than the IS 250. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned 2 other Lexuses and never bought new but I saw this car about 3 wks prior to knowing I was going to need a new car and I just about fell over! The body style blew me away! After looking at the pre-owned, this car won hands down with all of the changes and upgrades that have been made and worth every extra dollar! They are pkg. the car different then the brochure and give you great features std. and in the upgraded. I upgraded plus nav... all of it a must. (Didn't do the Mark Levinson system - the std. sys. seems is great!) The power is excellent and the interior is very comfortable and quiet. An outstanding car for "entry level" luxury. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car handles and looks and feels great. I like the remote entry, push button start. The HID lheadlights are excellent and really help with night time driving. One thing that may seem small is the all-weather mats. W/the cashmere int., they're a great addition and save a lot of wear</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After owning an Acura 3.0 CL for the past 10 years, this car is an obvious improvement. I drove the BMW 3 and 5 series and Mercedes and I feel the Lexus is a better ride with superior interior features. Car rides very smooth and is overall quiet. I am very picky with interior noise and upon quick acceleration, the dash creaks, but not enough to warrant huge concern. Quality of the interior with the navigation system is unbelievably cool. Pretty easy to operate and the chick voice on the navigation system is not nearly as annoying as a wife giving you driving instructions. It is much more accurate than I believed it would be. It is fun to drive and all controls are within reach.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my car for a week and am enjoying it more and more. Learning all the technology is a steep curve for a genetic anti-technoid. I like the comfort, the body style and the Royal Red Metalic paint! It turns heads everywhere. I especially enjoy the multi adjustable seats and the quietness inside the car at speed. I'm coming off a 7 year old Viper so it may not be as noticable to you. I averaged about 27.5 miles per gallon in mixed driving and expect that will improve with a bit of mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th Lexus ES and it is head and shoulders above the previous models. Tremendous value for the money with impecable quality. Quiet, with more power (thank you) and, finally, no more clunky hesitant transmission problems. This is a driver friendly vehicle, whose intent is to transport you safely, quietly and luxuriously. I have always thought of the ES as a vehicle that has great potential. Lexus has taken the ES to another level and it's not over yet.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style - although I wish it was more separated from the Camry - fit and finish and quality of materials. The increased power was a much needed and appreciated addition. Even at speed, the ES continues to be a very quiet vehicle. Power adjustments for the steering wheel are a welcome addition. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love this car. Have only put 2000 miles on it so far but I really love this car. I am a very big guy (wide not tall). I was tempted to buy a used LS to get the size, but have found that the ES 350 accomodates me very nicely. I did not want the panoramic roof, don't find it very practical since I drive alone most of the time. I sat in many vehicles with and without Mark Levinson sound system and could not hear a difference between the premium and ML systems at all using XM radio, iPod, CD classical music, jazz etc. I read over and over the ML radio is fantastic but I must say the premium w/nav etc. is a pleasure to listen to for about $2000 less. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM radio w/nav and iPod, smooth quiet ride. Comfortable front seats, interior design clean uncluttered but functional. New exterior design is very nice, have recieved many compliments. Chrome wheels add more visual appeal, keyless entry is very nice</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased the Ultimate Luxury Package - even though packed with features the car remains intuitive to operate and is VERY easy to drive - performance better than anticipated but performance is not a reason to purchase. The quality is excellent - used for commuting. Can't get over the quality. Only one nagging issue - I am 6'2" and am VERY close to the roof panels, even though I purchased the panoramic roof for the extra clearance - drivers over 6'1" beware and make sure that you are comfortable with the head room - vision at stop lights can be limited.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you can bond with the extra light front wheel drive steering you will love this car. It is quiet, powerful, smooth,and has comfortable seats both front and rear. The gauges are easy to read. We just returned from a 2400 mile trip and averaged 32.69 miles per gallon. The only problem is that the CD player is not working properly. While not a "driver's car", It is a great driving vehicle. I would highly recommend it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After hours on the Internet researching vehicles I spent weeks visiting local dealership?s test driving many, many cars of various brands. Next stop Lexus dealership, they have this brand new 07 Lexus ES 350 in the showroom. I started looking the car over and right off I was amazed with all the standard and luxury features car had to offer. After test-driving the ES 350 I was sold, the quiet smooth ride was awesome. Needless to say, that was the end of my lengthy search. If you're looking for a car, test-drive the Lexus ES 350 first, it might save you time & money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is quite possibly the best car in its class. We looked at the Mercedes E350 and the BMW 325i and the Lexus just blew them away. This feels a lot more luxurious and roomy than those other sedans, and it's got great power. The updated navigation system is very and clean crisp to look at, not to mention that it's a touch-screen system, so it's a lot more intuitive to work with. The stereo controls are all nicely laid out on the steering wheel, just like they were on my old Mercedes E320, so that's a big plus. It comes with all the luxury features you'd expect from higher end cars, like auto lights, auto windshield wipers, cooled and heated seats, compass, cd changer, rear camera, memory seats, bluetooth, etc. And it's so roomy in the back seat and trunk! This car rocks!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very well built machine with excellent design and power. Very roomy for midsize sedan with good room in back seating area. 3.5 (272hp) engine provices excellent acceleration and smooth power. At 80 mph it seems like you are doing 50 mph. Car is very quiet and smooth. Seating is excellent. Trunk has good space (fits 3 golf bags with ease). Finish is excellent and everything seems to fit.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power and overall performance is excellent and has many up-scale features. Overall finishes are excellent, much better than my Cad.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I was in the dealership looking at the I S250 the ES 350 arrived. MY GOD what a car! This car is the best entry level luxury vehicle ever sold. I was really going to buy the TL, but I ask any person who is not visually challenged which vehicle looks best? ES350! And the ride is perfect!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The keyless entry and touch engine start. The rise is perfect and its perfect design makes people try to catch up with me in traffic to see what type vehicle it is. The interior is roomy and spacious. The wood trim is adequate. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've been driving Lexus since 1999 and I think now I'm hooked. I love the car! For the price I rate this car better than the test drive my wife and I had in the 5 series BMW. The car is just all upgrades to say the least. You need the Navigation system even if you know your town like the back of your hand. My overall driving experience is at an all time high. Luxury I finally feel value in paying for. If you're thinking about anything else in the price range, forget it! I even like my ES 350 over the GS 300 because it's just so grown up. The only thing I would do different is get it loaded and not just with Navigation, but after the test drive I couldn't wait! Neither should you and your family! </TEXT>

All the bells and whistles for a lot less than you would pay with some other luxury brands. No real reason to buy the smaller engined GS when this has it all plus better acceleration for about 10K less.</TEXT>

I love the navigation system with its backup camera. The sound system is exellent And the engine isvery powerful, much more than you'll ever need. I also like the keyless entry/ignition system. But most of all, I think I like the overall look of this gem. It is a GREAT car. And I think with the reputation of LEXUS, I can sleep good at night</TEXT>

It rides better, the trans is not sluggish and it gets up and moves out. I am a big guy I know they say it is the same size but I fit much better in this one than the 330. I have the ultra luxury model and I love all the features. This Lexus ES 350 Is one bad ES. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The new ES 350 has been a great car to date. If you're looking for an entry level luxury car at a decent price, it's definitely worth a look. It can get pricey with all of the options, but if you watch it, it's actually a pretty good value in this segment. Ride, handling, performance, build quality and gas mileage have not disappointed. Although our car still has very few miles on it, I would recommend it. Worth a look and a test drive. It might not match some "sports sedans" in all areas, but I think it's an overall very good performer that will hold it's value well and be satisfying over the long run.</TEXT>

The new engine/six speed transmission package is outstanding. I think it will convert any diehard manual transmission folks. I include myself in that category. What a pleasure to drive. The ratios on the transmission are suberb, especially under hard acceleration! The technology available just blows away the competition in this price niche. Rear camera;park assist; bluetooth; air pressure; and on and on. I recommend the car to everyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car, loaded with high-tech features, offers a smooth, comfortable driving experience. Driving it has a "liquid" feel, with steering, braking, and acceleration smoothed out. However, you *do* feel the road beneath you; you're not so totally cocooned that you can't tell when you're going over cobblestones or speed bumps. The engine has more horsepower than earlier ES models, and there is an all-new 6-speed automatic transmission. Mine *did* require servicing within the first month to fix a brake rotor that was not machined properly and was causing a moaning sound; however, it's worked fine after the servicing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Too many features to list; highlights include keyless entry and ignition, comfortable ventilated (heated/cooled) seats adjustable in many ways; GPS navigation; Bluetooth cell phone integration; CD/tape/FM/AM sound system with aux jack for iPods; backup camera; park-assist radar; much more.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Driven Honda/Acura since 1986. Looked to buy RL/TL & Infiniti M35 but this car sold me, even above the GS. Hot style (finally), cool ride and luxurious all around. Sure a different feel than TL or M. But as I get older the fun of driving comes from the roominess, ease and support of having the car do more for me....and at a great price. This car is contemporary and leads the pack and for me, it also reminds me of the days as a kid when Caddys and Lincolns made heads turn by its smoothness, plushness and power. Except the ES 350 has more to boot with its Levinson and Premium package to awe you. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Lexus and Pound-for- Pound there isn't a better car to be found. It has almost all the options found on my LS 430 and drives and rides almost as nice. The engine is extremely strong and smooth with that Lexus civility but now with true spunk and power! The styling speaks on its own. It's a beautiful car with an agressive front fascia and a gorgeous back-end. I average 24.5 mpg in mixed driving. And the high-end options normally found on top-end luxury vehicles are awesome. I even have a few options not found on my 2004 LS 430 like memory presets on the passenger side, knee bags and my favorite, the Auxilliary input jack for my iPod! This car rocks! I Love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite is the Auxilliary input jack which is nicely hidden in the armrest. The controls are simple yet functional with virtually every button providing multi-functions.

<TEXT>I've owned many cars from all the German & Japanese manufacturers. I fully appreciate performance and luxury in a vehicle. For this purchase, I was in search of the best combination. The other cars on my list were the Acura RL & Infiniti M35. You might think that the ES doesn't belong in the same class with the others & it doesn't... for performance. With the ES Ultra-Luxury package it's close to the same price class. The ES offers the best overall combination of comfort, technology, simplicity, luxury & MPG. In short, it's a better value than both the others. It will not handle to the RL or M35 standards, but try it. It's a new breed of ES that is sure to please.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very smooth transmission. Great, quiet ride. Great radio and sound. I expected more than cardboard on door panels. Flimsy glove compartment door, trunk lid. Not enough front seat thigh support. Navigation system a colossal disappointment. It is practically useless outside major metro areas. Pretty picture, though. No way to open trunk if power lost. Fold down rear seatbacks with full access to trunk would be great. Front end too low, scrapes most curbs. Fatter tires would give even smoother ride. Roof line too low for tall people.

<TEXT>Bought the ES 2 weeks ago. Today was the 3rd time it went back to dealer. Lots of rattles from front passenger door, front deck (stereo area), rear deck (seat belt). I was driving their loaner ES 350. That car has nearly same rattles as mine. Rattling is the problem you can't find during test drive. After you take the car, if there's a rattle you need to locate a more precise spot so that it may be easier for their technicians to find and fix. Really doubt about Lexus's quality.

<TEXT>Overall it is pretty much what I expected from Lexus, except the finicky transmission. It is quiet and despite what the competition thinks of its looks it gets plenty of second looks; it's black with darkened windows and the spoked rims. It is often mistaken for the much more expensive LS by the uninformed including my boss and co-workers who ask "are we paying you too much?? and "how did you afford that". If only the transmission would settle on a gear and not want to jolt my bad back when in stop-and-go traffic or even the slightest incline I would give it a strong 9. Had to have a new transmission put in at 5000 miles, new transmission only slightly better.</TEXT>

I would have bought an Acura, Audi or BMW (anything, actually) if I had known the nav was disabled.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the most competent non-sports sedan I've ever driven. Very powerful engine (although you could eat breakfast while it selects its gear in automatic mode), great comfort, and amazing integration of electronics - GPS, climate, audio, etc. Really a beautiful vehicle. I have a big complaint, though, about the GPS system. You cannot set destinations or use many of the features while the car is in motion. This is billed as a safety feature, but it's a terrible inconvenience, especially when a passenger is sitting next to the driver. In summary, it doesn't have the soul of my 528, but it's a great compromise when looking for a classy ride with great power at a great price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just finished a trip to and from Canada of about 1600 miles. Most of the driving was on good roads in hilly and mountainous country. On regular gas I averaged almost 35 mpg at an average speed of 67 mph. The car's mileage calculator said 34.7 mpg. My calculator said 37.9 mpg. The ES 350 is not a formula one car but it is supremely comfortable, handles well for a sedan and has sufficient power to do what needs to be done.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have 905 miles on the odometer, but there are a few problems with it. The homelink refuses to connect with our garage door system. The rear view mirrors tilt down in reverse like they're supposed to, but they don't come back up. I'm sure these problems are nothing that the dealer can't fix, but with a car in this price range, you'll expect something better. Size was the issue for us so we looked at the Audi A6, BMW 530xi, the Mercedes E350 4Matic, the Infiniti M35x, and even the Lexus GS350 awd.The ES has the best value and has the best ride for the price even though the handling can't beat some, but it's expected.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The keyless start. The rear moonroof. The navigation is really easy to use. It has a lot of unexpected power and a very smooth ride. We like the 6 CD Mark Levinson sound. Rear seat passengers like the fact that there isn't a hump on the floor so there's more room.</FAVORITE>

I got all the bells and whistles: Levinson sound system, nav, rotating headlights, Xenon bulbs, heated and cooled seats, etc. It actually has good acceleration and handles very well for a four door sedan. It gives plenty of warning before you get in over your head. It decidedly is NOT my Daytona Coupe, but only cost half as much and it gets 31 mpg on the road (the Daytona gets 22 but has 600 hp).</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Lexus, and now I understand. Beautiful car with a great balance of upscale comfort/technology and power/performance. In only a few days worth of mixed driving, I'm averaging 26.5 mpg. The Mark Levinson DVD/nav system is incomparable, and the Bluetooth system works great. It plays telephone sound out of driver's front speaker on the dash with microphone near the rear view mirror. People don't know you're on a speakerphone. Plenty of room for 4 adults, possibly 5. Like the backup camera, front and rear backup sensors, and the keyless entry and push button start. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mark Levinson DVD/nav is awesome. Play a DVD and watch it on the nav screen while you're parked (listen to it while driving), fabulous sound. Rear glass roof/shade on UL package very nice.

<TEXT>My experience with this car so far has been good except for the ventilated seats, driver and passenger, which are agonizingly uncomfortable. The lumbar support digs into your back and cannot be adjusted sufficiently to correct the problem. I tried to get the company to deal with this, but they said it could not be fixed and they blew me off. I sat in other models to compare seats. The nonventilated seats are more comfortable, but none of them compares favorably to the sports model. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car 10 months with 11,000 miles currently and have read all reviews. I agree with jerky transmission when below freezing, otherwise OK and you get used to the transmission. Be careful when coming to the first couple of stop lights because it will jerk. No mechanical issues but dashboard has this creaking noise every time I hit a bump. If you turn up radio you don't hear it but I don't always want to listen to the radio that loud. I have taken it to dealership twice and very helpful but no solution. They said something about rubber stoppers that are between glass and dashboard. Surely this will be a recall on the initial builds. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall the car is great with a beautiful interior and a smooth ride. There are two annoying design flaws that I am sure Lexus will fix in the upcoming 2008 model. The LED lighting is ridiculously dim, what were they thinking! Second, the latch to open the center console is exactly where your elbow goes causing it to open constantly. It is also a strange design that limits your ability to use it. They should also make the car interior a little bit bigger - an inch more headroom in the frony, an inch each more hip, shoulder and leg room in the rear. Then it would be closer to perfect. It is better than all its competition except maybe the BMW 5 Series which is about $15K more.</TEXT>

For space and comfort that I was looking for, the only other car that came close was the Infinity and it was more out of my price range.

<TEXT>The car has a vibration, it drifts to the right, and the steering wheel is off center to the left. The heated seats only get slightly warm at best. The dealer said that it was within Lexus' standards. In my years of owning cars they have the lowest I've ever owned. The GPS is the most difficult ones I've operated, and I've used several in cars, boats, and airplanes. I've used the very first built and fly a Gulfstream with two FMS that have GPS inputs. The GPS miles out of the way and will not use roads that have been around for decades. The POI are years out of date. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I like the drive of the ES 350 better than the 01 BMW 325xi. It is quiet, smooth and has a lot of power. Handling is equally good. I do not do 70 on a 35 mph ramp. If you want to do that then the bmw will be better (provided you have good tires). The ES 350 has an exceptionally quiet ride. I absolutely love this kind of ride on long road trips. When the car is cold, the transmission is a bit jerky. Within a 2-3 miles it becomes smooth but still it is not as smooth as BMWs. I love the keyless entry.</TEXT>

I haven't experienced any of the road noise problems that I have read about on this site, but have had some issues with the transmission "missing" between 3rd and 4th gear. I spoke with the dealership about this and was told that it is a computer problem that they are aware of that will be fixed as soon as the program is made available to the dealerships. This is my first Lexus and, I must say, I'm very impressed with the quality and attention to detail that went into this car - especially for the price. </TEXT>

I also, very occasionally, feel unexpected acceleration. Fit and finish are great. Unlike other reviewers, I like the look of the car. Don't feel it is stodgy at all.

I haven't experienced any of the transmission issues of earlier models; however, I have discovered a definitive wind noise which emanates on the driver?s side window between the A-pillar and the middle of the door.

I currently average 23 mpg back & forth to work and weekend driving. My only criticism to date is that the transmission sometimes hesitates shifting between 30-40 mph. I'll see what the dealer tells me about this. I highly recommend this car for anyone looking for high quality build and exceptional ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling inside and out. Navigation system, stereo, mp3 input and ride quality. Also love the keyless ignition.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Owned for 1 month. I researched every so called entry luxury sedan out there. None of them had the smooth and quiet ride that I have experienced with the 2007 ES 350 Lexus. Before you purchase an entry luxury car do yourself a favor and sit in the back seats of the Infiniti and Acura. No comparison for comort. Only sedan that can comfortable fit 5 adults. Try that with the competition. When driving over 60 miles per hour in each car, You will notice some noise in every auto except the Lexus. Much smoother, cushier ride then the Infiniti and Acura. Fuel economy. I'm getting 23-24 mph in city. All hwy. was 28-29 mph. Using mid grade gas. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Blue tooth cell phone, heated and ventilated and heated seats. Keyless ignititon. Quick acceleration on highway ramps. Most important comfortable and quite ride. Interior styling is very luxury-like compared to competition. Seats are very comfortable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had the car now for about 3 weeks. Since day one, I have had nothing but pleasure. I traded in a 02 CL500. Sure new it was 90K but this Lexus for the $$ is well worth it! This is a great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Lexus ES 350 is very nearly perfect. I love the clean functionality, the comfort of the car, and the driving ease. My mileage in stop-and-go traffic is near 20 mpg; my weekly commute and around town driving is near 26 to 27 mpg, at 55 mpg the mileage is in the 33 mpg range; and at a long-distance 75+ mph the mileage is 29 to 31. The mileage is better if I can buy gasoline without ethanol. My only issue is that the front head room is not adequate, but not enough for me to trade this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2007 is a big step from the 2006. It has a lot more leg room -- important for someone 6' 4". Powerplant is far more responsive and transmission much improved too. The 2007 is a lot nicer to look at. Interior lighting is inadequate and center console is almost an embarrassment of cheapness. The double storage compartments of the 2006 are missed. The new one opens and closes awkwardly. Lighted garage door opener buttons would be welcomed. Getting average of 26 MPG which is great for a car with this much power. More fun to drive than 2006 ES 330.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine performance and leg room. Always love Lexus fit and finish as well as reliability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded a three month old Mercedes E320 CDI for this this Lexus ES 350 Ultra and couldn't be happier. The MB was a technical dinosour compared to the Lexus. For less money I got better quality, more comfort and luxury appointments, and vastly superior tech options. The Lexus nav system makes the MB system look like it was stolen out of a Yugo, and the voice command and bluetooth features found in the Lexus weren't even available in my MB. I've got a very bad back that makes it difficult to sit in a car seat for long periods, but I've driven this car 5 to 6 hours in pure comfort. Most of all I appreciate the after the sale service rather than being totally ignored as I was by MB.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Lexus in my driveway (first is a GX) and apart from some headroom concerns for tall people and the lock on centre armrest that needs a location change, this is a luxurious and nice car. It is almost fully loaded and is a nice mix of features and value. It is a great handling car. We recently went on a 450 mile trip and it handled like a dream. I do not undertand the negative tranny press, because it seems to shift very well and effortlessly. As for purported wind noise, well, there is nothing excessive - indeed, it is very quiet. Now, I will admit that if you want a sports car this is not for you, but it is a great family of four vehicle that makes traveling easy and fun. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the navigation and rear view camera. Combination of fuel economy and power is highly desirable. Getting about 26 MPG per tank which is good for this type of car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT> Car looks and drives great. Ride is cloud-like. Much softer steering than my old SC 400 a sports car but it's a sedan and to be expected. Everything is great but NAV/GPS could be much better. Voice recognition works great so far except it is horrible with street names. Easy names bring up other streets. It's like 1 for 4. That's unacceptable. Also, you cannot type in destinations or bring up lists of places while driving only when stopped. Voice recog. works while driving but it's slow process. It's not a deal killer but I expected a much better nav design. Still a winner of a car. No Sirius radio installed bc of probs. Hope Lexus fixes this soon. Highly recommend car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I previously owned a BMW 3 Series. Although I did enjoy this car, my Lexus ES 350 is by far a better vehicle. It has more room overall, the climate control, sound system, and gas mileage is so much better! I look forward to getting into my vehicle every morning! Thanks Lexus!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature is the keyless entry. I no longer have to dig into my handbag to find the keys, they just have to be inside it for me to open the doors!! So convenient, as I usually have my hands full. When I get in my car, I just press the start button. I love it!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Lexus and now I'm hooked. Yes, the extras were pricey, but man they are worth it. The ultra luxury package and Mark Levinson package make a great car that much better. The ride is smooth and quiet and a beautiful interior; I'd rather be in my car than in my house. The Royal Ruby Metallic paint stands out in a sea of silver, white and black. This car is a keeper.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car looks great, is quiet and comfortable, with many nice touches. Initial build quality was not up to Lexus standards - multiple trips to dealer to address creaks and rattles, especially in and around dashboard. Center console is uncomfortable (padding on top is too thin), and it is frustrating that the nav is largely inoperable when moving (especially as the voice recognition is flakey). Also, the standard audio is barely adequate, especially regarding bass output. All that being said, this is still the best car that I could find in its price range, given its variety of features & functions, and its quietness, comfort & power.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my Lexus ES 350 for one month and have never been as satisfied over a new car as this one. Quiet ride, excellent interior design, and very responsive handling. There is minimal vibration through the steering system and visibility (including reverse camera feature) is outstanding. The interior amenities make this ride truly a religious experience. Also the dealership was outstanding and has an excellent service support record.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I labored over spending over 40K for transportation but got over it as soon as I hit the road. Did a 2600 mile road trip to Taos, NM within days and averaged 30.3 MPG doing between 70 and 80 MPH. Not too shabby for a vehicle with all this power. Ran midgrade fuel and never had a hiccup. Vehicle is super comfortable, quiet, smooth and powerful. The Navigation is a must have although a bit intimidating at first to use. The ventilated seats and swiveling headlamps are great innovations and extremely practical to boot. I have had to do some serious reading in the manual to unlock the mysteries of all the new technology but am doing nicely. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Gorgeous Royal Ruby Metallic ES 350 purch'd in Newport Beach, CA, Oct. 2006. Not easy finding this color with all the extra features. ES has full Ultra-Luxury Pkg, chrome wheels, window tint, and satellite radio. Looks like a fine piece of jewelry. ES replaced 88 Cad, Eldo, and beats Eldo hands down for fuel economy, acceleration, ride (YES!), and features. Love all the techie gadgets/features; discovering more each day. This car can play CDs, DVDs (also movies on 7" screen), and MP3 & WMA audio. Made a music CD in *.wma audio that contained 10 hours of music. Played beautifully in the Mark Levinson audio system.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my new ES 350 a month ago today. I must say I continue to look forward to every time I drive it. Sometimes I think it was built for just for me. The driving experience has been very fabulous, the creature comforts incredible, and my fav feature is that it's not Camry looking. I have the Nav system and it's great (first vehicle with it). Sometimes I just want it to get dark outside so I can see my HID lights adjust as I turn. Acceleration is much more improved over the ES 330 and the transmission is agile and responsive. You will not be disappointed with this car. I'm gonna buy a spoiler for it as this will complete the sporty look with the awesome dual exhaust. No regrets here!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I spent several months researching a car purchase, and decided on the ES 350 in stead of the sportier Acura TL. After driving 1 week, here are my impressions: The NAV system is the worst of all the 6 car makes I test drove. Voice recognition is useless at best. Took 12 tries to get my home phone right. Cannot adjust the NAV while driving. If NAV is important to you DO NOT BUY THIS CAR!. Very smooth ride as I expected. Good performance and acceleration for a luxury vehicle. Very poor center console. Difficult to use and little storage space.</TEXT>
