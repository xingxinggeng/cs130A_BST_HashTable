<TEXT>Update six month in. No mechanical issues to date, love it more now than when I purchased. I recently rode in a Lincoln Town Car - the Lincoln was not as quite, not as smooth, and was not as nice as the Kia. If you are looking for a Lexus or Cadillac at firesale prices, this is the one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth and quiet ride, wonderful quality on the inside</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Amanti primarily for my wife in January 2008. The Amanti I bought was slightly used with 10,300 miles at the time of purchase. We traded in my wife's 2001 Buick Century. Although she loved her Century, it could not compare to the 2007 Amanti. The Amanti rides as well as or better than a Buick Lucerne or Park Avenue, and goes like a rocket. I have never driven such a luxurious riding car with such power. The car had to be returned to the dealer for two minor defects; but other than that, it is rock solid with excellent quality. Anyone that drives a 2007, 2008, or 2009 Amanti with the 264 hoursepower engine will LOVE it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Electronic Stability Control, memory seats, automatic climate control, and wonderful, powerful motor.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It's been a year now since my purchase and I'm still a fan of the Amanti. Love the vehicle and it's reliability. I'm getting low mileage around the city but 80% of my driving is just that. City 15.8 MPG .. but on the highway I get a strong 34 MPG. I traded my lincoln continental in for this vehicle and was nervous about my choice. I went with the Amanti for value and warranty. I'm glad I did. I've not regretted my decision yet - in fact wonder how I got so smart. This car is just flat out fun to drive and has everything in it an on it I ever had with my lincolns. Especially satisfied with winter driving - electronic stability control is great. Check out the Amanti befor you buy anything. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I was driving one day and the tire pressure light came on - tire pressure low right front - checked it out and sure enough a nice nail in the tire. I was just about to pull out onto the highway when I caught the light. Great feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased used with 22,000 miles and loaded with leather, sunroof, alloys, etc. For the used owner car comes with 6 yr/60K full warranty. If you are looking for a BMW this is not your car, but if you want a Towncar-like ride on the interstate this is it. Lexus-quality interior, massive trunk and back seat, extremely fast, so quiet you won't hardly know it is running. I am getting 25 MPG with 80% highway, 20% city, far better than I expected for the size and speed the car offers. The car is a little quirky looking, but you don't see many and it sticks out in the crowd. Also, front-wheel drive and handles like a tank in the snow.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quality of trim and interior materials, lots of power, great gas mileage, super quiet and smooth on the interstate. Great warranty for used buyers.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>kickboyface</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>rented one of these for a week on a trip to las vegas based solely on the prompting of the counter clerk - "they're REALLY nice." she was completely right. fun. powerful. fast. loaded with features. i rented a Cadillac a few days later and this car was REMARKABLY better. if i was ever in this type of car market, i'd buy a used one in a heartbeat (they have terrible residual value and it's a spectacular car) -- you could get it for a steal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>adjustable everything (including distance of pedals to your feet). ultimately comfortable leather seats -- like driving a lazy boy down the highway. glassy smooth ride. auto- dimming rear view mirror.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my Amanti because I wanted a comfortable car with all the options without a high price tag. I have owned Mercedes, Lincoln and Cadillac and find this car very satisfying. As others have said, it doesn't have the "road handling" of a Euro car, but it amazingly fast and solid feeling. My trip computer consistently records 27.5 MPG on the highway at 70 miles per hour. I couldn't believe it myself. This is my second KIA and I will buy a third.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior Comfort and MPG for this size car. I like the styling! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have driven Caddy's, Lincoln's, Olds and number of other family style autos. The Amanti beats them hands down, the car drives and rides very smooth, no road or wind noise. Have had zero problems at 38k miles. The car is loaded with every option and performs great.I get compliments all the time, the rear end looks like a Lincoln and the front between a Benz and a Jag. Avg 19.5 MPG mixed HWY & CITY. Would recommend car to anyone who is looking for a solid built, smooth riding automobile with ALL the safety feature. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned a Caddy for 190,000 miles and loved it. Went to buy another and saw this bright silver like new KIA Amanti next to it. Carmax salesman said give it a drive--best value on the market for a full size sedan. And he was right. Have only owned it a month-- but already taken a couple of 800 mile trips. Great ride and performance. Great gas mileage and uses regular gas. Have a bad back and the lumbar support and adjustability was fantastic. Sound system blew me away. Wife was skeptical at first-- but after driving it a couple of times she said hmmm! Trust me that is a big compliment. Can't believe KIA is marketing this car harder,</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall room and ride comfort. Lumbar support and adjustability. Sound system. Tremendous zoom-zoom.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>UPDATE: I wrote the previous post 3/25/2008. Since then I have not regretted this purchase for one moment. In fact I've become a bigger fan of the Amanti. Extremely pleased and I've upgraded my initial impressions because I've had the chance to drive it. Great response, cornering. Wonderful highway feel, blows my Lincoln away. I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone. At least - don't buy anything - until you've looked at the Amanti.</TEXT>

<TEXT>JUST traded in my 2002 Lincoln Continental for my new loaded Amanti. I have to say I am absolutely amazed that I actually did this. I'm still in shock but was looking for a new car and fell in love with the Amanti. I was nervous about the size difference, roominess and comfort but after a day long test drive went back to the dealer and bought it on the spot. Never would have thought I'd own a Kia and that's the best compliment I can give - it had to really impress me to buy one. I haven't had it long enough to give a full - thorough review but so far so good. Drives great, fun power and more comfortable than I would have imagined. Quiet, smooth ride - that from a Lincoln owner.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior and seats ... fits like a glove. All the features of the Lincoln - inside - </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>20,000 miles and one year and I am more pleased than the 1st day. Not a squeak - burp - or hiccup. The car is perfect. Still a quiet smooth ride with no rattles or problems of any kind. I have done the normal maintenance and that is it. The mileage runs from 19 all city to 22 combo and 24-25 all hwy. The inside looks like the day I purchased it - quality is just amazing. Even the valet in the casinos are impressed by this car. Buy one - you will like it </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>quiet ride - seat adjustments - comfort I have every option and they all work perfectly. The leather seats look and feel brand new. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Amanti truly amazin</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have never really heard of this model until about 2 weeks ago. We bought one about three weeks ago. I am so proud I bought this 2007 because it is truly a luxury car not only in appearance and interior comfort and but the outside design looks like a Benz. I have owned well over thirty cars in my lifetime but this has to rate in the top three. BTW I am 62 so I know a lot about cars. This car is a winner. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The design, the interior quiet, the infinity sound system with 6 c.d. player but most of all, the true luxury ride even on long trips. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased a pewter beige Amanti with leather package (tan interior), ESC/safety package, 17 in. wheels and sunroof. After seeing an article online about the Amanti's redesign for 2007, test driving one was a relevation. I seriously shopped the Amanti vs. the Azera and a couple of other nice sedans, and the Amanti won. This car is an amazing value. I am continually being blown away by the quality and features. The quick power and smoothness of the ride are truly a delight. I'd say this car, for 2007, is the biggest hidden secret on the U.S. market, since Kia is not doing any advertising that I can see. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A real quality luxury interior, great seats, strong motor, and this car is QUIET. Rides like a Mercedes.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great car for the price. Comparable in interior room and size, luxury, sound, and performance to the more expensive Chrysler 300M or Buick Lucerne. Taken on 2 trips and was perfect touring car, even through West Virginia highways. Wife loves memory seats and power pedal adjustment.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Soft seats, but good bolstering. Auto-stick trans. Good engine power. Seat adjustments on door instead of under seat. Quiet ride, good performance, even kicking it up at highways speeds.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have 6900 miles now and this is an impressive car. It drives great, performs terrific and overall is a VERY nice car. The quality is amazing and people always comment and ask about the car (even more than my 2006 Chrysler 300). I took a long trip in this car and was never more pleased with a car. Mine is midnight gray with every option except the cargo mat. The quality of materials and construction is far superior to what you would expect in a Kia and rivals cars at ANY price. The mileage has been slightly better than expected. If you want a true luxury car at a moderate price - this is a great choice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gate opener (same as garage), door pockets that tilt out. Dual console, trip center, seats are very comfortable, one touch windows all around.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought a Midnight Gray Amanti with leather package on April 3. It has an unusual look that grows on me daily. It has an extremely smooth ride and a nice balance. This car isn't the flattest in hard turns, but I bought it for the ride quality. I wasn't looking for a sport sedan. I get almost as many stares in the Amanti as my red '70 chevelle. The torque and acceleration are greater than I could have expecteded. Only has 1500 miles so far but I love this car! The beautiful leather, fit and finish are awesome. Quietest, most comfortable car I've ever ridden in. An impressive car and so affordable. So far, the '07 Amanti is a WOW! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable seats and ease of entry. Adjustable pedals, 6 disc Infinity sound system. Love the layout of the controls.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I went looking for an SUV and thought I'd try the full size Kia. I was almost ready to buy it so I brought my wife to the dealership to look at it. First thing she noticed was the Amanti. Why don't you buy this instead she asked. So we took it for a spin and I loved it! We have owned Caddys,Vettes,Hondas, VWs, you name it. My last car was a Dodge Magnum Hemi. I can't believe I have a Kia but I know that if people tried this car they would buy it. This Amanti has it all. Reg. gas with awesome power and after 2200 miles I've averaged 23.9 MPG.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Radio, instrument cluster at night, all windows go up and down with one touch, rear windows go all the way down, get up and go, quietness.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Amanti. I enjoyed the first one, but wanted more power, period. I got it now. Love the sound with the dual exhausts. This is my dream car. Ready to take a long trip. Love the compliments.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dash/interior; additional lumbar spine adjustments; pedal adjustments; small compartment next to pedal adjustment which is perfect for my cell phone - no more sitting it next to the coffee cup and getting coffee on it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I cant believe I bought a KIA - I cant believe I bought a KIA. Will take delivery the day after Mardi Gras if all the paperwork goes through. By accident I looked at one and did a lot of research online and talked with a lot of people. Everybody that owned a Kia was happy. My kids are embarrassed for me, one has SL500- SL55 - S55 and GL450 other one has Lexus 460 and Yukon XL and others. They are just too yuppie. I am convinced I will be very happy with this car even if the buying decision may not have been "smart". I will report back after a couple of weeks driving. Just couldn't see spending $12,000 more for an Infinity M35. Amanti = nice car - not an ICON to impress others. Hope it works</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior comfort - quiet ride (better than M35 or Chrysler 300). I have seen a lot of people wanting a Sat Nav - WHY? A $1500 option when better ones sell aftermarket for under $300. I have used Lexus Sat Nav which is much better than Mercedes I have used. </FAVORITE>
