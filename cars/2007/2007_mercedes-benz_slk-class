<TEXT>I got tired of all the idiot lights coming on my BMW and bought one of these. I have had it 1 1/2 years and not a problem anywhere/anytime. Great acceleration and moves when you want it to in SF traffic. Car always gets looks and build/quality is excellent. You wont find cheap plastic or trim falling apart in this car. Also what I like best is the seat belt dosent rub no the leather (wear it out) BMW has this problem. Great handling car and 280 is enough power. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a fun convertible car to drive, more interested in a good ride, but also some ponys under the hood to get 'er going. I found nirvana in the SLK! I test drove several others - Z4's, Boxsters but didn't like the ragtops. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 5th Mercedes, dating back to 1987. It's my first roadster, after enduring a 2003 CLK (awful) and a 2005 CLK (vastly improved). Fortunately, this car is wonderful. The finish, the interior trim level, the seats, the workings of the convertible hard-top, the little touches like "air-scarf" and the other details all combine to make this car a joy to drive and a pleasure to own. It's, by far, the best built Benz I've owned since, probably, the S class I had back in '89. After a year and 10,000 miles so far so good with the exception of the navigation system (see below)!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The convertible top is great to use. The styling of the car either top-up or top-down is terrific. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Always wanted an MB and I am very happy so far that I bought this beauty. In fact when it went in for the 1000-3000 mile courtesy inspection,they left me a E-350 to drive for the day. It is actually not as comfortable as the SLK which wraps around you like a comforter. Even though I'm over 65 with a questionable back, this offers me more back support than the E-350. It's a head turner especially while wearing sun glasses so you can see the heads turn,but they can't see you. It's fast, very stable,fun to drive and engineered with almost nothing to add. The steering and brakes are very responsive. Handling around sharp curves is actually fun. It hugs the road without rear end slide. Love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I especially like the air scarf from a practical standpoint; but it just looks sweet all wrapped up in a beautiful paint job. People driving Audis and Corvettes love to watch the retractable hardtop dissapear with envy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in an 06 Audi A-4 Convert, 1.8T. I hated the turbo and paying prem fuel for 170 hp. My previous car was a '99 Boxster and I loved it, but it became a maint nightmare ($3200in 4 mons.) I was on verge of buying a new Boxster and decided to test-drive the SK (I had already driven Z-4, 350zx, S2000, TT, etc). I got a great deal ($6k off msrp) on SLK & 100% sure of decision. Boxster has great style but doesnt't have 7 spd automatic, hardtop convert, heated 'scarf', etc.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have dreamed about owning an SLK since the first time I saw one. I have not been disappointed. The car drives very well. It is glued to the road but the ride is not harsh at all. My car is the 350 6 cylinder which supplies plenty of power but still gets pretty good gas mileage. The brakes are awesome. The top mechanism performs flawlessly. The fit and finish were first rate. The only problem that have had was that the display for the radio/cd player stopped working. The dealer fixed the problem during the routine 1000-3000 mile checkup.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The retractable hard top is by far my favorite feature. I always wanted a convertible but I just couldn't see a soft top for several reasons - too easy to break into and not a good enough weather seal from the hot Texas sun in the summer time. The hard top has no such disadvantages.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is smoke and mirrors. It's slow, uncomfortable, gets poor gas mileage and is over priced. Paid 45K for a auto and have to tolerate 17 dummy phone switches because the car does not have bluetooth? Honestly, research BMW, Saab, Audi before buying this make. I'd return the car tomorrow if I could. Everyday I walk to this vehicle and wonder why I paid so much for a car with so little? Mercedes Benz must be making about 20 grand profit on each of these "very, very average" cars. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Went to the dealership with intentions of buying another SUV. Drove the SLK280 and fell in love instantly. We like everything about it. 0 to 60 very quickly. Handles very well. Car travels very well and is quite comfortable. Gets over 28 MPG. The warm air scarf on a cool evening ride is great.Be sure to use the wind skirt with the top down and your hair will look like you just combed it, even after a long ride. Good sound system for tunes. Top goes up/down easy and fast. Because the car is so much fun to drive we wanted to take it on our trips to the beach but there is not very much cargo space, so we have decided to UPS our luggage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>A couple of months ago I purchased an SLK280. I traded in my old 2002 SLK32. I love my old car but I like the new body style and the new changes in the 2005 models. The car runs and handles great, there is a loss in power between the 2 cars about 120 horses but the new 7 speed trans. makes for some of the loss and is more fun to drive, the interior seen bigger with more legg room. Everything in the car is great, no problems up to now, the sound system with the satellite option is worth it. There is a safety problem. The hatch to open the engine compartment is located next to your left foot, A couple times getting in and out from the car I opened by mistake with my foot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had no intention of buying this car initially, even during my test drive. But after a few weeks of ownership, we love this car. When compared to Porsche Boxter, SLK is more refined and I simply love the styling and we get so many compliments. The sporty red seats and its contrast to silver body is really stunning. For the money, you get a sporty refined ride, build quality is excellent- especially the hardtop-you can open hardtop with the remote key. Handling isn't great at first, but that's mostly due to stiff steering wheel at first, but it has loosened up. Now the handling is great and acceleration is surprisingly quick. I love the low grunt of exhaust sound. It's really sporty</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive this car 80mi a day in commuting to work on a mix of highway and back roads. It is the perfect balance between comfort and performance. It is a total joy to drive. I live in New England so threw on a set of snows, and even though it is rear wheel drive, with the traction control it handles quite well in the snow. I have put 10,000 mi. on it in 7 months and it has been flawless and I am a detail fanatic. People are always complimenting me on the looks. Just for the fun of it I may consider moving up to the 350 or AMG when I come off this lease.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second SLK and I like this model much better. The styling and handling are far superior. I enjoy the improved ride, satellite radio and other new features. I am debating if in my next purchase if I want to to move up to the top of the line in two seaters It is so much money in comparison to the alterantives. I cannot justify a company lease either this would have to b a cash purchase/lease. I'm not sure if the next model is worth it. But I love my SLK. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchases a new SLK 350 and started having problems with it within the first 3000 miles. The oil sensor was faulty and then after being in the shop 8 days I got the car back and the sensor receiver went bad. then electronics module went bad twice, crank shaft sensor went bad, Car stopped because of electrical bug and had to be towed. Steering wheel spring sensor went bad. Navigation system had to be replaced. Don't buy this car as the reliability is horrible. This car is constantly in for service.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love this car! I commute 150 miles daily so fun and comfort is key. I wanted a sports car but with a smooth ride, manual transmission AND a luxurious interior. That combo is hard to find. But it's all in this car and more. It's very quick but has a creamy ride (makes my old Z4 feel like a tin can)and the shifting is very smooth. The airscarf is awesome. The HK stereo incredible. Love the nav, but I wonder if the DVD is outdated, it doesn't list some very popular restaurants in our area? The car (mine's black) is stunning with the top down. All this and I feel very safe in it too.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>so awesome</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I loved it the day I got it and still do today. The SLK is a slick car that handles excellent and is so much fun to drive. It is small inside and there isn't much room for anything but the bare essentials, but the trunk space is marginally larger than in the past. Lots of fun, everyone checks it out and if you're in a hurry you can put your foot into it and the car will fly. The traction control is very responsive and impressive, but the front end does not stick to the road when cornering at very high speeds. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So I test drove both base model 280 and 350, and 350 with AMG sports pkg. The $4,000 option is well worth it for the looks and the improved handling of the car. It makes the SLK go from a luxury touring convertible to a real hard core sports car. Cornering ability with the lowered and stiffer suspension makes this a true competitor to Porsche Boxter/S. This car wins on styling, I get envious looks from not only Boxster owner, but 911 owners as well, I suppose a fully loaded SLK is pretty close to the price range of the 911. But you get the fun hardtop convertible. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hardtop convertible. Fast and stable on freeways. Going at 65 or 95 feels the same, you just past other cars at much faster rate.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>One deficiency is inability to add or replace the single CD with a CD changer although it is listed as an available option for about $400. Regrettably I did not learn of this until I had driven about 300 miles. To change from SLK 280 to SLK 350, which had one, dealer wanted $10,000, instead of the $4,000 difference of MLP of $4,000, for models, since my SLK 280 was a used car. Beware and be careful.</TEXT>

Save your cash and buy a real exotic 'cause this ain't it. 36K and the transmission had to be replaced. The engine knocks like an AMC Pacer on unleaded gas. Burns oil like the forgot to install the rings. I will never own another MB after this beast is put to pasture. Oh, MB has denied that they are replacing 350 engines like there is no tomorrow. So much for Dr. Z and his nonsense. He should make the remaining payments. The car is listed at 268 HP; no way it develops 268, more like 200, maybe. My Z4 could blow the paint of this beer can.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks are it. If you want a poser vehicle, spend away. If you want performance I suggest you take another look, elsewhere.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car is fast and hugs the road. I drove for 2000 miles in Europe during my European Delivery. On the hundreds of hairpin turns in the Dolomites, I couldn't even get the Stability Control to kick in, much less have the car break loose from the road. Other than the paint having some OrangePeel ( I notice that, no one else seems to ), I don't have any quality issues to complain about. Everything works as it should.</TEXT>
