<TEXT>I bought one of the first off the assembly line and have been very happy overall. Only problems I had were at 40,000 miles with the cowling around the steering column coming loose and at 48,000 the front wheel bearings going bad. Of course all of these problems were fixed by the dealer. The interior of the vehicle is outstanding, but the view out the rear window is somewhat restricted. And getting into the third row seat takes a little effort. The third row seat has to be one of the most comfortable available. Adults can actually sit there comfortably without their knees in their chest. I'm not crazy about the exterior design. No complaint with the power, it's great! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design and comfort. Power. Excellent ride and very quiet. Third row seat comfort. Flat folding power third row seats. Hauling capacity.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My GL has been into the dealer's not less that four times in under 30,000km, mainly for suspension problems. In this distance I already have had both front and rear shocks changed and whatever else could be changed down there to reduce vibrations, road noise & wheel-bouncing. Rear windscreen wiper blade fell off just a few weeks into car's first rainy season & I ended up with a scratched rear screen. Vibrations have not stopped & make the car unpleasant to drive. Windows shake (ever so slightly, but you hear the click-click all the time you go over a bump). I have since learned that MB has used the same suspension components which are fitted on the ML! (GL is wider though). Anyone out there?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car looks great, fuel economy, commendable. Very comfortable to drive, but rear seats lack flexibility&remain in an almost upright position. I think on a car this size, those seats should go all the way back, especially when rear seats are down flat, more so when you are going far with the kids.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well, I wrote a review and was very pleased after 3 weeks. After a year, I had to get rid of, because I could not stand the tire/suspension problems. Car pulls badly to the right. Dealer says, "Oh, that's just the crown in the road causing that." No way! Wore out tires at 16000 miles and needs an alignment every 3 months. Car gets aligned, and runs true for a few months before starting to pull again. Sorry I ever doubted BMW. Do yourself a favor. Check out the driving characteristics first. If you go on the Mecedes forums, you will see many have the same disappointment.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Luxurious quiet ride and feel, and so much power! Will out accelerate a Cadillac Escalade. Lots of room and great looks. The education it gave me to go back to BMW.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great driver, fun with plenty of power and comfortable. Good styling, controls are easy to use. It's really a joy to drive. Really disappointed in the quality of the tires-25K and they needed replacing. But the real disappointment is the quality and longevity of the brake pads and rotors. Had to replace both rotors and pads at 27K, unbelievable! You expect much more/better quality from a Mercedes Benz, especially under the mild driving conditions (Speed) in the USA vs the German autobahn. The dealer indicated they have changed material to a softer variation, ostensibly to resolve the squeaking issues that I have read about, but they have done this at significant reliabilty and customer cost</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drives extremely well, steering is excellent, engine has adequate power and is very responsive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Own this 13 months, bought brand new. Just completed 50k miles, had no problems. Excellent drive. With this size of SUV mileage is very good 24- 25MPG, perfect for the highway. Owned several SUVs but I think this is the best and think it will last forever. MB has really improved there product. We are very happy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats, including the third row seats, are very comfortable. Everything you touch is top quality. All rear seats fold flat. Auto tailgate and power fold-down rear seats. Air suspension.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I loved this car from the minute we saw it. We were planning to buy Ford or Chevy, but once we stopped at the Mercedes dealer, we couldn't leave without this car. It is an absolute pleasure to drive. We had to have a rear shock replaced, but no other problems after 20 months. Brake pads were worn out after only 15,000 miles which was a shock and disappointment, especially when we found out the cost to replace them. Apparently this is normal for Mercedes brakes. It's a great car, but expensive maintenance.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>3rd row flat fold and 3rd row leg room, overall quality, great acceleration, smooth ride, parking sensors are great, A/C gets cold instantly even on hottest days, overall interior comfort.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Owned this 07 GL320 CDI for 15 months. Overall fuel efficiency has been 22.7 mpg through 20500 miles. On the highway, we've gotten up to 28 mpg, and always 20+ around town. Very comfortable on long trips or short commutes. Handled heavy winter snowfall in Spokane and North Idaho with ease. Couple of items to be aware of when purchasing. Uses synthetic Mobil 1, so oil changes are every 10- 12k. Oil light comes on occassionally. Dealer states it's a computer glitch that hasn't yet been corrected. OE tires (we have Continental 4x4 Contact 18") are worn out and need to be replaced.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have to admit that I never knew this model existed. The room in this Mercedes GL has it all over the ML. The quality is light-years ahead of the Escalade. The ride is better than a luxury sedan. Came with an off-road package which I don't expect to need, but nice to know it's there. Rear entertainment, leather, nav, sunroof, and satellite radio are all top notch!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth powerful engine. Smooth comfortable ride. Goes anywhere in snow and does it with style. V-8 gets 16mpg around town, and 19 mpg on the highway. Rear entertainment and power everything. Just better looking than any other large SUV out there!</FAVORITE>

The ride is excellent and comfortable in locally or on long distance travel. My kids love the third row and the room is great. It has been an excellent investment. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded an ML320CDI diesel for a GL450 gas V-8. The diesel has a narrower power band, more gear shifting, with 3-4 second bursts of huge power on demand in the upper gears. The gas V-8 has a wide, slightly weaker power band, less gear shifting, extended acceleration leaves the diesel for dead. Pick your poison. V-8 averaging 18mpg overall on regular gas, canceling some of the diesel's excellent 25mpg on pricey diesel fuel. The GL air suspension gives a smooth, level ride. Think S-Class. Car-like steering and brakes, much better than the vague, jerky brakes on the diesel. Standard manual rear hatch is light, easy to use. Nav system data entry is tedious, results are confusing. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The GL is a great city car with a short turning radius and excellent visibility out the big, low rear side windows for lane changes, parking and such. More goodies: All side windows open. Two sun roofs. Fit and finish, style, quality and comfort of the standard MB Tex 7 seat interior is excellent. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This was my pick by far based on looks, but I gave my wife the 'command' decision. We drove everything out there from Lexus to Infinity and this one drove most like a car. She picked this one hands down. We have had to have the one of the air shocks replaced, but that was no issue. The fit and finish are superb and everything inside is solid and well constructed. We have taken it on 3 long road trips with 3 kids, and the quiet ride (for the baby), the comfort (my wife) and the joy of driving it (me) have further impressed us to the point that we will probably buy another in a couple years. The older kids love the back seat entertainment package!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 1st MB, got a good deal and jumped at the chance to own it. I love the way it handles, compared to my old standard SUV's. I wanted something smaller with room for the kid's sports stuff. The GL450 does not have an armrest so on long trips, anything over 30 min. my right arm goes numb, then I move it down to the bottom of the wheel, feeling less in control and still not comfortable. The navigation is very inadequate. Hard to operate compared to most on the market now. Should have compared more vehicles and not just gone for looks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Excellent vehicle, needs air pressure to read actual pressure in all tires. Very expensive to maintain. Mercedes does unneccessary things on scheduled manintaince such as check caliper thickness at 10,000 miles. Navigation system is one of the worst in the business but not the cheapest. 19 inch tires and wheels are a joke because the tires cost 3 times as much as 18 or 20 inch. MB tech fake leather is very bad stuff. Blue jeans stain it and it does not breath like leather. Pulls very nice and the brake intregation system is superb but far to pricey.Garage door opener works only on occasion. Very weak signal. All in all it is a very nice vehicle but MB has made it far to expensive to maintain</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>An absolutely wonderful driving machine. The CDI gets wonder mileage and has great torque for pulling. 7 speed transmission is a dream to drive. Seat heaters work to perfection. Power fold down seats are very nice. Third seat room is the terrific. Engine is quiet and smooth.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had an '02 ML500 and currently have an '06 Range Rover. This GL450 is as comfortable as the Range Rover, roomier than both, and the best ergonomics. The transmission is excellent and I like the upshift/downshift buttons on the backside of the steering wheel. Easy to use Navigation and excellent placement of the CD changer in the glove compartment. Rear view camera is clearer than the Rover also.

The acceleration beats the competition and the ride is similar to the S-class sedan. Overall, it seems like something out of their AMG class. The GL takes the corners well and the interior is very quiet even on dirt roads. The upgraded sound system plus navigation is a must have! Plenty of room for the two kids and lots of storage room.

<TEXT>Surprised at the fit and finish of an American assembled MB. Quite a departure from my '98 ML320 that my mechanic often cursed 'this is not a Mercedes!' Why choose the GL450/550 when 1) gas version comes at a $2500 premium over the diesel (not the case usually with diesel vehicles) 2) gas version requires premium unleaded fuel (premium still costs more than diesel) 3) the diesel gets 18/24 gas gets 13/18 ( GL550 will fare worse); average economy for both cars at 12k miles/year and factoring price differences for premium vs. diesel you'd save ~$600/yr in fuel savings on top of the $2500; Not noisy, not slow, no smoke or smell; 0-60 who cares?? it's an SUV</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>400lb-ft torque! rear 3/4 windows open, 7 speed auto surprisingly doesn't hunt, leather stitching & leather covered dash; solidity and drive smoothness give impression of an S-class not an SUV, backup camera, 3rd row seats, hitch, zero wait time to start, push button close rear door</FAVORITE>

<FAVORITE>400lb-ft torque! rear 3/4 windows open, 7 speed auto surprisingly doesn't hunt, leather stitching & leather covered dash; solidity and drive smoothness give impression of an S-class not an SUV, backup camera, 3rd row seats, hitch, zero wait time to start, push button close rear door</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in a Land Rover Lr3 for the Gl450. Wow what a difference! Better and smoother ride, more power, more luxurious, more amenities. The car is a real head turner. We are very happy so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great SUV. My family has had a Suburban for the past 14 years and it was time to downsize a bit. GL drives like a car, is extremely comfortable and has about every extra that we need. There are a few minor changes I would like to see. First, the windshield is at an angle which reflects the dash. Very distracting and third row seat dificult to get in. Should have automatic second ro fold up. Other than those minor issues and one major problem with parktronic (below) which was eventually fixed, this is one of the best cars we have owned and we hve owned most of them.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted to move out of my less than dependable Volvo XC90 into a larger vehicle with better mileage. I looked at everything and eventually bought the diesel GL320 for the following reasons: Exceptional mileage for such a large vehicle. The performance of the diesel engine is superior to that of the twin turbocharged gas engine in the XC90, as well as some of the larger V8's. Extremely quiet and comfortable ride. The standard air suspension is perfect. Initial impression is that it is as solid as a bank vault. Crossing my fingers that the recent Mercedes quality problems do not crop up. At 2,800 miles, best vehicle ever</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Air suspension. Engine, there is no detectable acceleration lag. Quietness. Ride. Suggest premium, lighting, and appearance packages. 19 inch wheels - Dad's favorite. Comfort access - wife's favorite dual headrest DVD - kid's favorite. Adults can ride in the powered third row.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only had my vehicle for about a week and I can say with confidence that this is the best luxury full size SUV on the market. I've driven and researched all other full size SUV's and they don't even compare! This vehicle is quiet, comfortable, smooth as silk. "Quiet as a mouse" diesel engine and transmission, and drop dead good looks. I keep driving around and never see the fuel gauge move as this vehicle with the diesel gets incredible mileage. Don't walk, run to your nearest dealer and order one as they are getting tougher to find due to the great demand. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I gave my Acura MDX to my daughter and was looking for another solid SUV. Fell in love with the MB GL450 at first sight. Beautiful inside and out. Then saw the 320CDI version and drove it. Couldn't believe it was a diesel. Who would believe that you could have large comfortably luxury in an SUV and get 27 mpg on the highway? I was only worried about recent MB quality surveys on Consumer Reports but felt a little better given that the GL was totally redesigned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love size and the looks. Navigation is a little complicated but fine once you get the hang of it. The Comm center gives you more information than you'll probably ever want. It has a great ride with a good road feel. You simply can't believe it's a diesel - no delay starting and it's quiet!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded my S500 4matic for the loaded GL 450 last December and haven't looked back. This is my umpteenth Benz since 1984 and I have finally found the machine to replace my previous favorite, the last generation E350 4matic wagon. The GL's ride height and comfort are outstanding. Acceleration is there when needed. Fit and finish are first rate. In fact, it feels like you are riding a sedan. Everything is offered on this vehicle that you could want, except perhaps ventilated seating but this may be nitpicking. Love this car so much that I pat it on the hood ever time I pass it in my garage. A car you can bond with. Bravo, Mercedes! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Must have the hands-free phone, auto dimming mirrors. Recommend highly the rear view camera, heated steering wheel. Love the automatic rear hatch closer and the automated raising and lowering of the third row seats. Automated third row windows a nice touch.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our second MB. We also own an '05 ML350 and have been very happy with it. My wife traded her 04 Acura MDX for the new GL. We looked at the new 07 Acura MDX and although the Acura appears to be a good value we were not impressed by the overall build quality of our 04 MDX vs 05 ML350. We also looked hard at the new BMW X5 V8 but determined it was no larger than the Acura MDX and takes you into the price range of the much larger, faster, smoother and more practical GL. We just hit 3,000 miles and we are still fighting over who gets to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The vehicle is large on the inside but drives/handles like a smaller vehicle. The engine has abuntant power and the transmission is amazingly smooth.

<TEXT>Looked at MDX: too small, too ugly exterior. Suburban Z71: looked good with too cheap materials interior for a 50K car. Then we decided to buy the '07 SUV of the year: The Mercedes GL450. The body doesn't look as sexy as the X5 we have, but for the big 3rd row seat, the cargo space, it can't get any better than this. Fit and finish of the exterior and interior is excellent, beautiful. That's all I can say. I also test drove the Audi Q7. I like the look and the exclusive status of Audis, but the materials they used is nothing close to Mercedes or BMWs. With a comparable V8 engine, Audi wants $60k plus. That's why you don't see many people driving Audis. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We've owned the GL for three months now, and it has been flawless. I've put 4,000 miles on it, with regular trips from the SF Bay Area to the sierras.

This is by far the best vehicle if you plan on using the 3rd row, a real person fits back there. This handles like a big S class. Overall it's not too big, not too small, performs beautifully, and fit and finish is as good as it gets. Best luxury SUV out there. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats and interior are right out of the S class. MB command system has gotten much better. Smooth 7 speed tranny and 7500 lb towing capacity. And a 3rd row you can actually use.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At 200.3 inches, it is the perfect mid- size SUV( BMWs new X5 just went from 183 to 192 inches -- and is still too small ). Superb driving, passenger comfort, power, and acceleration. 12 inches longer than the ML translates into much greater load capacity. This is the first new car we have purchased in many years (and our first SUV ever). The need was there. Why did Mercedes wait so long?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had 40 cars in the past 25 years, but this is one of the best! The new GL Class is my 7th MB and the best one to date. Power is smooth and responsive, steering is fluid, sight lines are not restricted. My two complaints are the braking, which is touchy and not fluid, and the seats. The seats could use a deeper bottom cushion for your legs, a la the '07 S Class. I do have the multi contour option which helps, but doesn't solve the problem. Gas mileage is good, reaching about 18-19 on the highway. Interior space is roomy and silent! Air suspension eats up the bumps, too! Barring some lower back pain on long trips, this is the truck for you if you want to haul, be it kids, or cargo</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quick power folding third row, lots of room for cargo with back seats folded, silent and smooth interior thanks to thermal glass and air suspension!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We order a new '07 X5 but after having borrowed the demo from the dealer we found the X5 still to small for a family. Still has the BMW performance though. So we purchased the GL450 and found that it has the size for the family and pretty decent performance. The interior features are great and the safety features are even better. Mercedes did a nice job with this vehicle and I think they hit a high luxury SUV market that BMW has yet to hit. If you need room for kids and cargo look no further! I just hope the build quality coming out of Alabama is better than I've read in the past.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Mercedes Benz should pat themselves on the back for this one. This is my 3rd Benz and my favorite. Constantly receive compliments on the looks, both inside and out. Drives like a dream. The car is tight, quiet, comfortable, luxurious, fun, and in a league of its own. As a single dad of 2, it does everything a minivan can do, but does it with masculinity. The only negatives as others have stated is the DVD location and controls are not accessible without stopping the vehicle and pulling over (if you have little ones) and you only have access to the 3rd row from the passenger side of the vehicle.

<TEXT>I have only owned it a week and love it. It has more room than my previously owned 2006 VW Touareg, which was a good crossover SUV which did not enough room for my three sons, even after one just departed for college. Also, the M-B GL450 is so much nicer then my previous 2000 Lincoln Navigator relative to ride, gas mileage, and just plain sophistication. The M-B Tex interior is well worth forgoing the extra $1650 for leather, too. The only feature that could be improved is the back-up camera showing the actual orientation of the vehicle for parking, etc. My VW Touareg had this at $20K less. All in all, this is not a lot different in features then my wife's 2005 M-B S500. Just Great!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wasn't 100% sure this vehicle was worth the price when I signed the paperwork. But after a 750 mile trip home the day we purchased it, I was completely convinced. The ride is smooth and silent. The interior is well designed and comfortable. And the vehicle has all of the features a family needs. Our model is loaded with all of the options less the distronic cruise control amd the vented leather fronts seats. I averaged 18.8 MPG on our return trip. Not bad given the vehicle was loaded to capacity. Definitely investigate the keyless go. Walking up to the car with bags in one had and your kid in another and never having to unluck the doors or insert a key to start the gine is nice!</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a great vehicle. Moved from an '01 Landcruiser I loved to this vehicle. Would have bought another "cruiser", but the style and options are a little dated. So far this vehicle is far superior to the "cruiser". The transmission and ride is unbelievably smooth and comfortable. The acceleration is great for such a large truck. It has almost every option you would want in a vehicle of this type and so far they all work wonderfully well. The interior is absolutely beautiful and all of the controls are efficiently located and I understand that most are copied from other Mercedes vehicles, which is good because they have been time tested. </TEXT>

The exterior design combines elegance and muscularity in a way that should become the new standard for luxury SUVs. The same can be said for its ergonomics, which are simply outstanding. The controls for its many gizmos and gadgets are readily accessible and fairly intuitive, allowing us to avoid spending our nights reading the owner's manual.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall appearance; unusually guiet ride for a big SUV; excellent transmission; powerful engine, at least for our needs; multicontour seats (optional) are fantastic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wasn't 100% sure this vehicle was worth the price when I signed the paperwork. But after a 750 mile trip home the day we purchased it, I was completely convinced. The ride is smooth and silent. The interior is well designed and comfortable. And the vehicle has all of the features a family needs. Our model is loaded with all of the options less the distronic cruise control amd the vented leather fronts seats. I averaged 18.8 MPG on our return trip. Not bad given the vehicle was loaded to capacity. Definitely investigate the keyless go. Walking up to the car with bags in one had and your kid in another and never having to unluck the doors or insert a key to start the gine is nice!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Her: Keyless go, power folding 3rd row, power rear door, navigation, rear entertainment system, convenient cup holders. Him: Strong engine, class IV towing, satellite radio, safety features, rain sensitive wipers, overall command system interface</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a great vehicle. Moved from an '01 Landcruiser I loved to this vehicle. Would have bought another "cruiser", but the style and options are a little dated. So far this vehicle is far superior to the "cruiser". The transmission and ride is unbelievably smooth and comfortable. The acceleration is great for such a large truck. It has almost every option you would want in a vehicle of this type and so far they all work wonderfully well. The interior is absolutely beautiful and all of the controls are efficiently located and I understand that most are copied from other Mercedes vehicles, which is good because they have been time tested. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Third row seats that are comfortable for adults. Great entertainment system. Efficient controls - unlike the hated "Idrive" on my BMW 745i. Interior styling, fit and finish. Great ride and handling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This truck is awesome! I drove every SUV under the sun and this one blows them all away. Not too big, not too small. Just right. Love the pick up. Pure luxury. Hope there won't be any problems to work out being it's a new model and all.</TEXT>
