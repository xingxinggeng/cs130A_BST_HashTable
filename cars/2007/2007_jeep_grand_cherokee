<TEXT>When placing my Jeep gear it will jerk real hard, then when pushing on the gas the Jeep will hesitate and lose all power, I too drive to work in heavy traffic I am scared to death that I will be in a fatal accident, last year I took this Jeep to the dealership and explained what the Jeep was doing he explained to me it was bad gas, it now does this a lot, I once again took it into the dealership he explained to me this time that it was the transmission module which of course is not covered in Chrysler wonderful life-time powertrain warranty how Nice this is going to cost me a pretty Penny, so I have been reading on all these complaints about the same problem come on Chrysler recall</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my 2nd JGCL. I previously owned a 2004 JGCL and loved it, never a problem. However I currently own the last Jeep I'll ever own. Bought new off the lot 19 mths ago and it's been in the shop 4 times. First the windows would randomly roll down on their own. The back window gate latch will not catch, have to slam SEVERAL times to get it to catch. Several times a week it will stall around 20mph, no matter how hard you stomp the gas...was fixed, now a reoccurring problem. Now at 42,000 miles, I just got it out of the shop today due to the water pump, fan belt, and thermostat. Of course it's still under the powertrain warranty, but it's about to find itself another owner!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Jeep, I love them and my only complaint is that I waited so long to purchase one. I brought this one is 2007; I have not had any problems oil change regularly and it keeps me moving. I have to drive all over the Lancaster county for my job, I might start my day off at one end of the county and finish my day a the other end and my jeep always gets the job done no matter if I travel highways or dirt roads. Fuel is another story, but I am not willing to give up a car I love for money. I'm looking forward to the 2011; they are changing the body again, it looks smooth.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have JUST started having problems like everyone is describing, stepping on the gas and no acceleration. Malfunction light came and I just happen to be at my mechanics, he ran diagnostic and said it was definitely a problem with the transmission. That was last week and the light has gone off and it running just fine, again. Thankfully. FOR NOW! That was scary!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a 2007 Jeep grand Cherokee Laredo 4x4,3. 7 liter v-6. This is not the first Jeep I've owned but will probably be the last. It has been to the dealer 3 times in the last 6 months for the same problem. Driving down the road no matter what speed it does not stall but the computer drops it down to 20 mph and the engine will shutter. Sometimes it will correct itself and sometimes if you turn the car off and restart it it clears what ever the problem is. Dealer says they cant reproduce the problem. All I know is that this thing is dangerous. My wife was driving in heavy traffic and it cut out on her in 65 mph traffic and she almost got rear ended. Has anyone else had this problem?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle for two reasons: the style, both interior and exterior; and the positive experiences of my in laws and their multiple past Grand Cherokees. Unfortunately, I will not be recommending Jeep to anyone. My factory warranty expired less than two months ago, and all my problems have appeared since then. The passenger side power window "up" doesn't work properly. The window stops mid way everytime. The power steering has been making groaning noises for the past week or so. The outdoor thermometer has been permanently stuck at 86 degrees for a few weeks. With less than 40,000 miles, and problems appearing almost daily...this vehicle has been a complete disappointment.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It takes a special sort of person to drive a Jeep. If you drive it like a Toyota, you will probably hate it. If you have had Jeeps previously, you know the "when the weather gets ca-ca you pull your select/command trac lever". Not so in this. First time that all time 4WD is at the base model. *Even though the machine delivers top notch treacherous road handling ability, you will forget that its an all time, all wheel drive vehicle and still reach for the lever.* Electronic Gas Pedal is very fickle!It gets confused going up/dwn rolling hills, almost as if it doesnt know if its going up or down the hill, same thing when accelerating at speeds 25-40 mph, I.E. getting on highways from onramps.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Between 40-45mph my JGC 07 stops accelerating. Hesitates for up to 10 seconds, then finally gets going again. After owning the car for 6 weeks, I was turning onto a highway and all the power cut off. Pulled over and couldn't get it to start. No electricity either. Let it sit for a few minutes, and it started again. Took it to the dealership and they said they couldn't duplicate the problem, so they didn't fix anything. Today, it jerked hard when I put it into drive. Barely got down the street at 20mph- turned around- and it sluggishly made it back to the driveway. This is a 2 year old car! We owned 2 other Jeeps that were great. This one is undependable and I'm pretty disgusted.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you own 2007 Cherokee be very careful. A year ago I turned onto a very busy road and lost all acceleration, with the peddle to the floor all I could get to was 15 mph. I took the Jeep in and they said nothing was wrong and informed me it was most likely bad gas. Apparently this was not the case as it continued to happen almost weekly, and now a year later it happens several times a day. I have had my jeep in service several times for this and they always tell me there is nothing wrong. Someone please give me some advice, I am in a position where I can not sell and I don?t have the money to buy a second car. I feel I am putting myself and other drivers at risk every time I get in my jeep.</TEXT>

Headlined was reuined, Exaust leaked, they fixed the wiring problem. it kept shorting out. it was in the shop 9 out of 11 months of ownership. my third jeep and very disappointing.

<TEXT>Bought this Jeep as a demo with 6k miles on it. Has been a great car since then. I follow the maintenance schedule religiously, and the only problem i've had is the front window regulator, which was quickly replaced under warranty at an oil change. I find coupons on the jeep website for a $21.95 oil change and tire rotation, which is great. I really love this car, it is fun to drive, the perfect size, and i average 17.7 mpg is soley city driving! Runs great on regular fuel. It is the perfect car for me. I cannot wait for the 2011 version to come out, i am hooked on Jeeps!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I fell in madly love with my green Jeep grand Cherokee 2 years ago. I've taken amazing care of her hoping that this would be the vehicle to last me the next 10 years. At my last oil change it was noticed my battery was seriously corroded. Last week I started it up and ended up with a funny rattle. I let the Jeep warm up like usual but when I backed out of the driveway and pushed on the gas nothing happened. I was stuck in the road. Took it to the dealership and they say nothing is wrong. A week later it wouldn't start it was towed to the dealership. They said it was my battery but still having issues with it hesitating you push the gas. I've been stranded twice in the last two weeks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven Jeeps since 1998. Started with Cherokee and purchased my first Grand Cherokee in 2004. December 2006 I purchased a 2007 Overland. This is a great SUV. Nice design improvements and noticeable change in suspension from the 2004. Had some problems with the CD player and ended up changing it out on warranty. Great in the snow, but all of the jeeps I had were. Love the wooden steering wheel in the Overland. Interior now is similar to a loaded Limited. Not much difference between a 2009 loaded limited and an Overland. I have the 5.7 hemi. City/highway runs about 15.5 mpg. GPS is great, but the newer versions have a 3D mode, which is better. 2007 improved the ease of folding rear seat</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my first Jeep I've ever bought and to be honest for a winter vehicle I don't think I'll ever buy anything else. I've driven several SUVs and trucks and I have to say by far the Jeep Cherokee is the absolute best vehicle I've ever driven in the Snow. The 5.7 eats through the gas though I would recommend maybe going with the 3.7 or 4.7 if your worried about gas millage. With the 5.7L this vehicle can really move but again 14 MPG is a little steep when gas prices are high.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Transmission Problem</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I bought my forth JGC last Fall. A disappointment for sure. The first two JGC I bought were sturdy, spirited and were mostly maintenance free. I bought a 2005 JGC vehicle (used w/20K miles), the transmission failed within two weeks. I was able to get it refurbished under a recall notice. This car continued to be a problem with leaking transmission and delayed/sluggish acceleration. I traded this one in for a new 2007 JGC believing that my former problems were because that vehicle was used. Not true. My new JGC sporadically has had strange transmission problems. On two occasions the transmissions cutout during a rain storm, the dealer has not been helpful. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car new in 2007. Two relatively minor problems were repaired by the dealer, one a rattle in the roof due to a loose wire bundle, and a leaking transmission. The serious problem with this car is an inexplicable engine stall during driving and the dealer has been unable to diagnose the problem. This car has stalled suddenly at all speeds to 60 mph, and is clearly dangerous to drive. I have contacted Chrysler, and so far no resolution. If there are others with the same problem, please notify Chrysler immediately. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this Jeep from a lease return. I have had it a month and electrical problems, latch open problems, replaced sensor discharging battery (can't find the problem why) and engine light coming on, and the dealership said its something to do with traction control? problem not solved yet, it has left me on the side of the road 3 times, not starting because of these problems, have replaced the battery, never solved problem yet. I am disabled and can't walk without use of a Walker or canes, I bought this, to have a reliable vehiclle. I had a 2004 ranger with 340,000 miles on it, that never broke down on me once in 8 years.

<TEXT>Far and away the most enjoyable and useful car to drive that I have had. (I've had many) Very smooth, quiet and maneuverable, and sure footed; perfect for the Western N.Y. snow belt in which I reside. I did have a vibration in the drive train which was remedied under warranty by replacing the front drive shaft The dealership was very obliging and helpful. Got over 20 MPG on a recent 8500 mile road trip road around the country. While other reviewers have expressed some negative comments about their Grand Cherokee my experience has been entirely positive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The only problems I have had with the vehicle was the door sills, the were kind of popping up and the seat cushions did something funky and it looked weird. The dealership replaced the door sills and we haven't had a problem with it and they also replaced all the leather front and back even though the problem was only in the front, they did a pretty good job but not great. The problem with the seats is kind of back but I guess that's the nature of the beast. It has great acceleration and is comfortable, we take it on long 300-500 mile trips and its a dream. I would highly recommend this SUV if you don't mind a SUV gas mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 4 x 4 Jeep used (20,000 miles) 2 weeks ago & have been nothing but pleased with it so far. I was looking at getting a Tacoma, but am so glad I got the Cherokee instead. Great car like ride, smooth acceleration & comfortable interior. You get so much more for your money with this instead of the Tacoma (unless you need a truck bed). I highly suggest the Jeep Cherokee. I'm paying a lot more for gas, but I expected that. I didn't buy the vehicle for great gas mileage. Lots of people have written reviews complaining about the reliability, but so far so good for me. I'm pretty easy on my vehicles though.</TEXT>

I've never owned a vehicle so great off-road. I have no trouble in the toughest snow/ice, through streams, on unpaved back roads & trails. Recently I experienced a problem where the Jeep would not shift out of 2nd gear, the dealer updated the computer & I haven't had a problem since, also, the power window motors when bad & were replaced around 22,000 miles, I am currently at 33,500 miles. I use full synthetic oil & a fuel additive & get about 17.4 MPG city, 21.4 highway. My only complaint is the speakers, easy fix.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our 3.0 liter Turbo Diesel CRD 10 months a go. The vehicle is right hand drive and purchased brand new in New Zealand. We returned the car after 5000 Km for the following- whining noise coming from rear Differential, this has since been repaired and just recently been replaced with a new diff that I believe has come from a Russian second world war truck, as it certainly sounds like one, in other words no solution. This has been exasperated by a poor transmission, poor shifting quality - delays in up shift, and a clunking jerky down shift from second to first in slow stopping conditions, we have a new transmission on the way out from the States, poor plastics and seats.</TEXT>

Unfortunately, as soon as the warranty expired, the check engine light started going on, and there was no power to the engine upon acceleration. When this happens, I put the car in park and in drive again and the performance is back. Check engine light seems to go on when there is less than 1/4 tank of gas. Bringing it to the dealer next week to see what's going on, but this is very disappointing. This is the 4th Grand Cherokee I've owned, and the first I've had problems with.</TEXT>

Our Jeep Grand Cherokee has stalled out and has slipped out of gear 14 times during this time. The vehicle only has 11,000 miles on it and the Chrysler Dealership repair shop first said it was a fuel problem, then it was error messages identifying the transmission, and now the dealership has told us that it is unable to duplicate the problem and has given us the Jeep back with no repairs being made.

I test drove many vehicles looking for fuel economy. Came down to it I was not giving up my Jeep! Until I found my 2007 Laredo with a sticker price as the same as my 2001 sport. I was willing to give my Jeep for a Jeep! Every Jeep owner will not give it up and if they did wish they had another! I love it, only 2k miles on it, but I have no worries. Bought the life time warranty and the rust proof coating! I I would not buy a Chrysler other then the Jeep. I just can't get over the k-car. I love my Jeep!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Jeep. It's fun to drive, comfortable (and I'm 6'3" 250 pounds). It has all the right options, and I LOVE being able to use E-85 in it. I haven't had anything go wrong with it, and there was only 1 service recall issue, new antilock brake firmware. It's reasonably good on gas, not Honda levels, but I didn't expect that from it. It's large enough to haul the items I frequently need to haul, without being too big when not hauling things. It's easy to drive and will climb almost anything. I haven't found deep enough snow yet to stop it and the stability control system is superb.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>E-85 is an excellent option. Around town I suffer no loss in fuel economy running it, but the mileage does suffer on the highway with E-85. Excellent ergonomics, everything is easily accessible and simple to use. Heated mirrors and heated seats are great in the snow! </FAVORITE>

Bought it brand new and it started leaking in TWO separate areas immediately. First time I brought it into the dealership they said there was no leak (tell that to my previously spotless driveway) they fixed one leak but refuse to acknowledge the other! They even tried to tell me it was normal run off! worst service dept I have ever dealt with. wont buy another vehicle from that dealership EVER, I'd rather walk. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased an 07 Grand Cherokee AWD used for a very good price. I wanted an awd/full time 4wd vehicle that was not too big for city driving. I also considered a Subaru outback. No other midsize SUV is as small as the Grand Cherokee. That is due to the lack of the third row, which is completely unnecessary IMO. This allows the GC to be a perfect size for all around driving. I also considered a Subaru Outback but the deal on the vehicle was too good to pass up. Sure, its fit and finish is not Toyota quality, but it is a very solid vehicle, excellent offroad capability, strong suspension parts, unbelievable on road ride for a vehicle with a live rear axle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>See my earlier review here, still a fun vehicle but has its problems. Still very fast and have caught a few very quick cars off guard. Transmission planetary spacer destroyed itself from the factory install resulting in damaged transmission and torque converter. Dealer service spotty at best. Took 2 tries to finally find a Jeep dealer that allowed for confidence, Century in Mt Airy MD. Brakes wear fast and replacements are 3 times that of a typical brake job. Parts for rotors and brakes alone online are $650. replacement brakes are better than the stock units, less dust and squeal. Interior very plasticky in its build it will grow on you.

<TEXT>I have had my 4.7 eight Laredo for over a year. It's a loaded Laredo with Boston sound, six cd changer, Sirius, heated seats, sun roof and so on. I have driven from Ohio to Virginia and back twice now and got decent fuel economy for a loaded down 4x4 suv. I got over 21 mpg on the highway using cruise control, and even got near the same going through the mountains. I get 16-17 around town. The ride is above average for this type of vehicle. The all wheel drive does well in heavy snow conditions. I have yet to see any E85 fuel available in my area. I would like to have that option since my engine is built for it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Drive it for a week prior to purchasing, you will change your mind if coming from a GM vehicle. This is the second Chrysler product I have owned and the second I have been unhappy with. For the 2nd time since 08/07 I have had 'gear shifter' problems and is in the shop to have it replaced again. Unlike GM dealerships and their catering to customers while their vehicle is in for service I was handed a lowest of the line Jeep Patriot as a loaner. Just goes to show how much Jeep appreciates their customers. I will NEVER purchase another Chrysler product once I get rid of this one. From GM to Chrysler is like going from luxury to ghetto in my opinion.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Grand Cherokee. I owned a 2002 before this and I am a loyal Jeep customer. I love the way it drives and rides. It is very comfortable for long trips on the highway and short ones in town. I love the way it looks on the outside and inside. The only issues I have with it is that there is a little tire rubbing when I crank the wheel all the way right (doesn't happen when I turn left) and that the transmission seems to struggle for a couple of minutes on a cold morning. Also the gas mileage could be better but what do you expect for a large SUV. I get about 15 miles to the gallon in town and about 22 on the highway. Not too bad I guess</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the Grand Cherokee Limited Diesel! Second choice over 09 Murano. WOW the moment I test drove it, I loved it! It drives, handles like a luxury sedan! 4WD makes corning a breeze! No leaning/siding like most other SUVs. I feel safe,secure! I noticed people admiring the body style from other mid size SUV owners! Lotsa of interior room. 5'9", large frame,feel very comfortable, wide spaces to stretch! I feel no vibrations, gas mileage terrific with average fwy/street driving at about 22.8 to 23.1 per gallon with diesel. Its heaven!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited, a 2007 that we just bought new in 3/08. These are great vehicles. If you can do it, I highly recommend the Limiteds. They are luxurious but sporty. I'm admittedly a gadget girl, so I love the little features--stereo controls behind the steering wheel, power memory seats and mirrors, leather interior, etc. The V8 drives like a dream, smooth but very quick. It is so fun to drive. Design is classic. A much "cooler" choice for this soccer mom than other options!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased the GC primarily due to availability. Ordered in Korea and delivered in Germany. We have come to really like the GC...it really grows on you. I am very happy with the Quadra-Trac II which was a major selling point, along with the GVW (safety). We have the 4.7L E85 option but really wanted the CRD...it was unavailable at the time. Have not run it on ethanol yet but do know I get much better mileage using premium gas. It handles well on the Autobahn but definitely needs better rain tires. The ride height and shape proves to be a real nuisance with gusting cross-winds as I've recently found out. All in all we are satisfied with our purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I come from all-Japanese car background (our second family car is Honda Accord). My JGC was leased because of the terrific deal, and this is the only good thing about the Jeep ownership. I will gladly join other mad reviewers about the sluggishness of the transmission: it often "refuses" to shift gear for 4-5 seconds, unless I press the accel. pedal all the way to the floor. What a joke?! My other complaints: predatory gas consumption, weak engine for the weight of the body, cheap interior appointments, skimpy storage volume in the hatch (my friend's Honda CR-V, which is a compact SUV, can fit more items in its hatch), dull doors that spring back after opening, unless one sticks out a foot.</TEXT>

Really like the accel on US81 and gas isn't too bad on cruise. Really like the remote start, Sirius, auto dim, blue tooth and pedal adjust. Hard to use the backup camera as it is offset to the left of center. FX has lines on- screen to guide into parking. Great interior improvement over previous JGC. Very little tire noise at speed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our 3rd Jeep 4X4 Grand Cherokee We both love the car but theres room for improvement. The Seats sit to high for me I'm 6'1 my head touches the roof with the seat all the way down. Interior is not as good as the 1999. The 1999 Had a much better interior a less plastic feel. The 1999 felt like you were in a sports car. The 99 got 17 MPG all the time and It was the bigger 5.7 V8. So far with the 4.7 V8 and 4,000 miles on this one we are getting only 13.7 adverage MPG the it does offer flex fuel but none is avaliable here in Texas so it's a useless add. I miss our older better mileage more powerful Jeep. But I still love the Grand Cherokee's</TEXT>

Then it will take off, by that time the other guy is at least 3 car lengths a head of you. I just don't get it. This truck is to have 420 pony's. But it feels like it has half that. Its said to say this but Jeep needs to re-think things a little. I still have my 01 X5 4.4i. And I had my buddy race me with it, sure enough my old X5 beat me by a car length. I'm tellin you, they just don't build them like they used too. Even BMW has changed there stuff. I'm getting rid of this truck and picking up a Porsche Pepper. That turbo S is sick. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought this Hemi Limited a week ago and have put 1,700 miles on it so far. It is so much more comfortable than my '06 Tacoma Double Cab, I can't believe it. The interior is outstanding, with fit and finish very good, and very quiet. The power seats are extremely comfortable, and the Sirius radio with Boston Acoustics is great. I am taking it in to see if the dealership can take care of a rattle in the dash and wind noise around the driver's side back door. The hemi has unbeleivable response, gets reasonable mileage (17.5 mpg overall)and is a blast to drive. The quadra-trac II with limited slip front and rear is truly amazing. I'm happy now, we'll see if I am a year from now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This our first Jeep. With the year end deals and rebates, we purchased a Jeep GC with the Rocky Mountain package, that include lots of extras. Also included was an option package with heated seats, remote start, and adjustable foot pedals. The high-end sound system with 6 DC changer and Sirius radio provides great sound. The seats are very comfotable and the interior pleasant. The feel of the brakes is perfect. The front wheel well protrudes into the drivers foot area making it a little tight for the left foot. Gas mileage is fair averaging around 18.3/mpg with normal driving. The dark tinted rear window makes it very difficult to see when backing up at night. Very pleased so far.</TEXT>

Not sure of V8 but this is E85 capable, 30% cheaper in MN but less efficient too. It's also similar enough to our old JGC we felt very comfortable, and the $4k rebate & discount beat all others.

<TEXT>I traded in an Acura RSX for the Family Truckster. I also own a Mazda Tribute. The Hemi is a must Have option. I would say that I am very happy so far but I do have a couple of issues. First the warrantee is very limited. With Acura the warranty covered everything up to 50K. This warranty is not even close, so be warned. Also I am wandering if anyone else has noticed what I term fluttering of the engin at low RPMs going up hill? I might be just feeling something that is not there. Finally, your vision is limited with the low profile windows. The SUV has great power. The style is much better than the normal soccer mom SUVs and all the features are useful. For the price this rocks</TEXT>

Parking brake needs to be in the driver foot well but it can?t because the foot well can?t even fit my 2 feet. No rest pad for left foot in foot well. If the jeep had the interior of the Chrysler 300 I would have bought one. Whishing there was a brand new 1998 GC on the lot with a Hemi. Bought a Ford Sport Trac instead</TEXT>

Not a lot of changes but the ride is the same and the comfort is the same. I love the Hemi and we enjoy using the Jeep for road trips as it is very comfortable to drive and ride. Winters in Omaha are never a problem with the Jeep. It can get through most any snowfall and stick to the road easily.

After 2,600 miles I have no major complaints. I did have an issue at about 2,100 miles with the vehicle not starting but it, for some reason, just needed a jump. Was going back and forth between the Hemi and the 4.7, but in the end chose the 4.7 Not as quick as I had hoped, but still fine for everyday driving. Averging between 15-16mpg in mainly stop and go traffic. Between returning buyer rebate, a discount through work and the manufacturer rebate, got over $9,000 off sticker. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought almost new (4300 miles) and my wife and I love it! Traded in a 2003 Suburban Z71 and not looking back. Same fuel economy, no third row (we didn't need it), but the SRT8 is easier to park and way more fun to drive. My wife was considering the BMW X5 and the Lexus RX350, but she always had a soft spot for the older Grand Cherokees. I pointed out the SRT8 had better seats and better performance than the X5 (she's an aggressive driver for a girl :) and she didn't believe me. One test drive and she was hooked. I wasn't looking forward to driving a minivanish Lexus or even the more performance Bimmer (and I own a 540i.) But this is truly a vehicle that both of us love driving!</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a great SUV. Looks great. I got the Black/Slate Gray combo. The Hemi is powerful, it runs quiet, the Nav is great. The leather/suede seats are great. Much, much better than my WJ, but I miss it. The Overland attracts a lot of attention. I have received so many compliments and I have only had it for 2 days! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear back up camera, Nav, Parksense, Hemi, sound system. I love everything. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The AWD has a heavy draggy feel, especially turning. There is no manual switch on the rear camera (unlike RV), so no way to monitor a trailer via camera. It's instant off, so if you pull up, you lose the view. Objects are much closer than they appear. Adjusting the brightness of the nav unit is possible, but no adjust for when in radio mode, except ineffective dash brightness. I have a towel taped over the dash as all settings are way too bright at night. Per tech there is no way to turn off the display. Per dash computer, MPG has been a disappointing 11.5 MPG over the first 300 miles. Roadside coverage is watered down - no coverage for lockouts, flats or gas.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Vehicle has quiet smooth ride. Heated seats are toasty, and have a lower setting available.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Jeep purchased, actually it's even my first SUV. I've always had 4 and 2 door cars. I brought the car because I've always loved Jeep's styling and invoice minus $3,500 rebate helped me love it even more. Gas mileage is OK, I guess I didn't expect hybrid like mileage. Has the truck for about 2 weeks, loving it so far. Had the dealership reverse the tires so its completely blackwall, they forgot to put the stem caps on and now my TPSM is going nuts and the steering wheel shakes at above 50mph. Don't know if that is the cause or not but I scheduled a service appointment. If you're looking for a good SUV, that is comfortable, affordable, and fun to drive, definitely test drive this truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Back up sensors & camera, Bluetooth, overall exterior and color (White) always wanted white with dark interior. Auto sunroof, heated seats, power pedals, 6 disk mp3 player (rare). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Sold an Escalade for this SUV. Superfast, Car and driver reviews say 13.40 in the 1/4. Sounds great, spotty build quality with paint and plastic. Great performance, great handling rides like a performance car should, not for the person who wants to ride on an air cushion. Gets a lot of attention at lights and parking lots. Stops on a dime with the huge brakes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound, brakes and power. Brings back muscle car days. Nothing like going from 40 to 80 to get on the highway. Surely will result in a few tickets. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I use this Jeep for weekend driving from CT to NH and use it off road quite a bit. It's is a joy to drive on the highway. It's fast for an SUV but a tad torquey around town (lots of head snapping) with the family and dog in the car. It's quite capable off road but doesn't seem as tough as the 2001 Jeep I had or my Tahoe Z71 with a heavy duty suspension. It also gets worse gas mileage than my Tahoe. If you have to choose between a larger SUV and this one I would chose the Tahoe over the Overland. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Had a 2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I loved the performance - wife did not like the transmission. Went to an Acura MDX. Now back to the Grand Cherokee - lots of vehicle for the money. Great options with the limited package. The 4.7 V8 is not as spirited as in the 2000? Watch Chrysler - newspaper cited a significant recall for the 2007 Grand Cherokee - dealer's service department did not address this recall concerning loss of electronic brake function, antilock brake system, traction control and speedometer functions. Given the dealer apathy, I doubt I would be too quick to buy another Chrysler Product.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Hemi engine option is the way to go. The power is smooth along with the ride. The ride is very car-like and the end of the year deals made it a great buy. It is slightly lower and less roomy than our 2004 Mountaineer but the redesign in 2005 improved the Jeep. Handles well, gas mileage down but that is because I like the exhaust sound and the ability to go with it being new and not broken in yet (only 300 miles on the odometer). The navigation system and Sirius radio helps along with the standard remote start system makes this SUV a standout. Drive the 4.7 V8 first and then drive the Hemi - you will be sold.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Jeep; the prior ones were a 2001 Limited and a 2004 Limited. Each time I bought one there was general improvement in features, comfort and reliability. This 2007 Overland is a huge jump over the 2004. Ride and handling are much improved. The interior seems more spacious and quieter. The new features (backup camera & remote start) are now must haves on my list. The power of the 5.7 Hemi over the previous 4.7 is very noticeable. Fuel economy is in the same range as the 4.7 (still improving as I put more miles on it). Overall a much improved and refined vehicle - less truck like than the previous generation. Looking forward to going on a long trip with this one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hemi power, backup camera, remote start, power fold-in mirrors and smartbeam headlamps, strong brakes. Independent front suspension really improves the ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Pros: Power, ride quality , driver position, handling and all the cool high tech features (cameras (yes there are 2!), auto climate, lights etc.) Cons: Rear seats seem to have been made only for kids...or really tiny adults. I am less than average build (5'8") and I would not want to sit in the rear seat for even a short duration. Stereo sound is not center balanced...wonder if a dealer could make that adjustment.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power! On tap and seemingly unending. Very comfortable front seats...'throne like' is what my spouse said. Rear view camera. Auto dimming headlights.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the first Jeep I have purchased. Overall it has been very good. 8000 miles to date so it is still new. A/C will whistle with the medium fan setting. Ride is great. Power is good. Have the Rocky Mountain Package which makes the Laredo more of a Limited. No real complaints to this point. I would recommend this Jeep to other potential buyers.</TEXT>
