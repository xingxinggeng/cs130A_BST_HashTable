<TEXT>26 months, rolled 56,000 miles with NO issues. Observed fuel mileage of 30 MPG, combined. First set of tires lasted 30K miles am still on the original brakes, front and rear. I change the oil every 5,000 miles. Threw in a K&N Filter when new so the 30K service was just an oil change, tranny flush, and fresh plugs for $150, total. Was thrilled to find out this car has a timing chain not a belt so no $500 timing belt service is needed at 60K, just fresh plugs, coolant flush, brake line flush, and probably another tranny flush with an oil change to the tune of about $300. I drive the car every day and drive it hard. It's been well cared for and has performed flawlessly for me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great looking car! Corners like a cat on carpet. Very fuel efficient. Cheap to maintain. Good visibilty. With Anti-Lock Brakes and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution, it stops like you threw out an anchor, even while cornering. Very powerful A/C and it doesn't lug the engine while in use.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the base model 5 speed with AC and have generally been pleased with the car. I suggest buying an automatic because the trans is covered under the 10 yr 10000 mile warranty-- the clutch is not. Mileage in town 24- 27 and 31-33 on highway. I highly recommend grabbing a new one as opposed to a used one with low miles-- the 2009s have a rebate and you also get the 10 year warranty--with used you only get 5. Also, used are hard to find and factoring in the rebate, you don't save that much in purchase price. (My family has owned 8 Hyundais, new and pre-owned)</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I are in the Army, and we needed a vehicle that got good gas mileage. Our other vehicle being a Dodge Ram 1500. We got a flyer in the mail advertising the sale at the dealership we go to to get our truck serviced and decided to stop in and check out what they had on the lot for the special sale. We found this on the lot with only 13678 miles on it. I took it for a test drive and liked it. It did not seem to sluggish, it shifts real easily. I travel from Savannah GA to northern MI every 3 to 4 months, it is 1098 miles each way, this it only cost me 70 to make it each way.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Peppy engine and very sporty handling. This car took the sting out of $4 a gallon gas. I drive 80% city and routinely average over 30 mpg. Side panels scratch easily and could use a larger center armrest. This car will save you a lot of money over the years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Airbags failed to deploy in a collision traveling at 55 mph and then hitting an embankment as well. Read NHTSA and other consumer complaints regarding this problem with the Accent and other Hyundais and don't find out the hard way. We were very fortunate and everyone walked away from this death trap! Other prior problems include cheap tires from manufacturer that manufacturer and dealership did nothing to correct - referred to tire maker who said they didn't care about the complaint - no exaggeration! And of course car is very uncomfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I feel swindled by the Hyundai people. Things started off without any real problems. Never had an accident and I always tried to keep-up with any maintenance. Sadly, after 30000 miles, my catalytic converter is destroyed, I've had serious ignition problems, and they've had to replace the spark plugs like clockwork. Just traded that sucker in. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car for the gas mileage. About a week after I bought it, I noticed the Tach doesn't work when its cold. The dealership cannot find anything wrong with the tach. About a year after I had it the AIR BAG light came on, and I had the module replaced, now I have around 23000 miles on it, and the battery is shot. Gas mileage right now is around 23MPGs. When the brake fluid is cold, don't touch the brakes. They get really touchy, and can cause whiplash!! It is sluggish going up hills of any size or when more than one person is in the car. I would recommend to everyone not to buy this vehicle!! As soon as I can get rid of it, I am!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I rarely use the heater because just having it off typically it gets too hot just from the air coming in off the engine, Its small and easy to maneuver. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my accent! Although, at 50,000 my water pump went thus causing the engine to overheat which in turn had to be completely replaced. Thank god for the warranty! Impeccable service! The pick up could be a little better when switching lanes. Interior door panels scratch real easily. Center console would be Nice. In all I love it, trading soon for something a bit bigger.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Hyundai accent. It's small and gets around 30mpg on gas. I have had a problem with the ignition, for some reason the key wouldn't turn at all so they had to put a new cylinder in. It didn't really bother me cause of the great warranty so I didn't have to pay a dime. Also I have used the roadside assistance twice and the service has been flawless. Overall, I love the car and plan on driving it until it dies on me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall a decent sporty car for the money with plenty of standard features for the price and great economy, however some switches (headlights) still feel cheap, and the engine is downright asthmatic with the a/c on (which in Arizona is a lot). You'll find a lot of people riding your tail after green lights while you get up to speed. Driver's armrest on door is rock hard, what were they thinking? I can't even bear to put my weight on it because it hurts my elbow. Shifter is slow and balky. B&M shifter, yeah right, from their spare parts bin maybe. Love the styling, the SE rims really add a wonderful sporty look to the car, get the SE if you can, it totally transforms the look of the car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather wrapped steering wheel, precise feel through corners, styling is very nice for a small econobox. Fairly roomy inside for a small car. Engine is extremely quiet at hot idle, you almost can't tell it's running.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a Surprise just bought my Hyundai Accent 07 as a second car. I was looking for an affordable 2nd form of transportation as I own a Jeep Wrangler that was somewhat pricey to buy and pricey to drive at 15 mpg. I love my Hyundai Accent SE already! It handles well with the 16 in tires and sport suspension. Power windows, mirrors, and locks; 10/100,000 power train, roadside assistance and a real smooth ride all for a great price. Good job Hyundai not as fun to drive as my Jeep in the Summer but surprisingly very close and for half the price. I am very happy. The only down side so far is it is a little sluggish on the hills with the AC running but that is what I expected for a 1.6l gas sipper</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power everything, 16 inch Tires with the spots suspension, Road side assistance and good performance with a smooth ride. Good job Hyundai</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my '07 Accent for over a year, and have put 22,000 miles on it. So far I have not had any problems, mechanical or otherwise. After the break-in period I have been averaging 36-40 mpg in mostly highway driving. The car is roomy for two people, is very easy to drive, and everyone comments on how it looks (most girls think it's "cute"; most guys think it's "ugly"; but at least it's getting noticed, which is more than you can say for most of the cars in this price range). I traded in a full-size vehicle for this little guy, and I couldn't be happier with it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my car in 2007. I have had problems from the beginning. I just wanted to know if anyone else out there has had problems with the car not starting after making a few stops around town? I turn the key but nothing happens. It is almost like the battery is dead but everything else works. After I try for a while the car finally starts. I took it to the dealer, but they cannot seem to find anything wrong with the car. I am very frustrated with the situation. I was stuck in a parking lot for over a half hour . I have finally decided to let them keep the car until they can find what is wrong with it. I am very interested in knowing if anyone else is experiencing this same problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT>MPG was low for first 3,000 miles. I am now averaging 33.5 MPG with Automatic while driving 60/40 Highway/Town. I reviewed Fit, Versa, Aveo, Yaris and Mini before purchasing this car and with the improved MPG after break in I am delighted to say I was right. THE cost, reliability, quality and super warranty are superior to all of the aforementioned vehicles. It is not even close. Great Job Hyundai, I wish the American automakers would follow your lead.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my car for just about a year and a half. It started since day 1 of bringing it into the dealer to have a check engine light looked at. A year and a half later they find out that they had to replace the intake manifold and 7 valves. Now after 3 weeks of getting my car back, I cannot drive it because they FORGOT or RUSHED to hook up the fuel line so gas is Running out of my car when its running. I have to wait to have it towed to the dealer tomorrow to have the FIX what they did. When I can trade this thing in and not be upside down on the car I will. DO NOT BUY!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the worst car I have ever owned. I had to have the engine replaced 4 months after buying it brand new, and I need new tires already also. The wheel shakes incredibly bad when driving at highway speeds making it nearly impossible to control the wheel when driving on the highway. Extremely unsafe car.

<TEXT>I got my accent last year in July. I have about 25000 miles on my car in less than a year. I live in DC but work in Annapolis so that is an average of 64 miles just for work. It is just me and my 4 year old and I absolutely love this car. I drive to New York at least once a month, the last time i was able to drive from DC into NJ then into NY and halfway onto the NJ turnpike on one tank of gas. I went for this car because I know nothing about cars and the best feature is the free road side assistance when you purchase the car as new. The car can also withstand a lot.I have been in two accidents with minimal damage to my car but major damage to the others</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned my Accent SE for a year and now have 25k miles. The car still runs/drives like new. The car has performed flawlessly. It hasn't required one single warranty repair or adjustment. Mileage and performance increased slightly as the engine loosened up with break-in. With 50/50 city/highway, I get 28 when not using winter blend fuel. Luggage capacity is very good with the seats down but rather tight with the seats up. Road noise is average for a compact but the engine does get very buzzy and loud @ 3000+ RPM. Especially when down shifting while climbing a hill. The transmission gear hunts a bit. A little more power would be welcome to match the impressive road holding capabilities!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Idles dead silent and rips fairly smoothly to red line. Good headroom. Tall doors. Key fob unlocks hatch. Excellent cornering. Impressive stopping distance with ABS/EBD brakes and other safety features lower insurance cost. Rear seat bottom folds up and seat back folds down for LOTS of cargo space. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my GS Accent NEARLY new. It was 6 months old with about 10k miles. It is the bare bones model, no AC, not even a radio. I only paid $7,500 for it though. For the money, it's as good as they come. I made a few upgrades, put in a stereo (it had speakers, go figure), tinted the windows, put some 16" alloys on it, and presto! It's a sweet little ride! It has significantly more power than my 2001 Honda Civic, but the gas mileage is not nearly as good as my Civic. They really should throw a 6th gear on the M/T as the RPM's are 4k at 80+ MPH. This might help with gas mileage too. I can accelerate up a hill in 5th gear, which tells me it needs a 6th. Quality is comparable to the 01 Civic.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's actually pretty sporty and fun to drive. It handles like a go-cart. Best looking car for the price. Way cooler looking than the Nissan Versa. The 6 speaker system is pretty good with the deck I put in. TONS of room on the inside. I'm 6'2" 220, and I feel small inside this car, believe it or not</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased it in Jan. 08, very pleased with the build quality, performance and gas mileage. I am tall, over 6 ft and have adequate leg, hip, head and shoulder room. However: the drivers seat is very uncomfortable. The side cushion on the left side of the seat pokes me in the ribs, making driving even a short distances uncomfortable. I have been told there is nothing wrong with the seat. The dealership is refusing to replace the seat. My wife finds the seat comfortable even on long rides. If you are tall check out the comfort level before purchasing this vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I like this car. Great fuel mpg, Don't expect this until after 5000 miles/8000kms.Usually get 33/36(winter with snow tires)35/41(summer) mpg.The interior is roomy up front,Im 5'11" 210 lbs no complaints.I don't plan on being in the back, all controls are where they should be (except the trip meter),and easy to use. Great road feel,precise steering,(the rims and rubber help). For an (entry level) Ride I'm very surprised, with the fit and finish of the interior, (yes the door panels scratch easy), The audio system is ok for now. Did my homework before buying a new ride. Try to find sunroof,rims and rubber,foglights,pwr winows/locks,leather accents,keyless,with a comparable warranty/price GoodLuck</TEXT>

<TEXT>Nice Car. I really enjoy the Handling, Stereo, Power Accessories and Hatchback. High Quality Build with nice fitting and reliable function. Gas mileage is lower than expected but changed to Mobil 1 and added turbonator and increased mileage by 4.7 per gallon and added 11 horsepower to help with passing gear and highway ramp entry. Love the rims, low profile tires and fog lights. I also own 2 volvos (S80 and 40) and I find this a fun commuter to add to the stable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So you envy that friend or neighbor of yours their new Toyota Yaris. You know that is what you really wanted, but you couldn't afford it. But you still wanted a new car, even though you are on a very tight budget. Well, friends, despair no more, because the perfect new car for us budget minded is here, and it's the sporty, peppy and very spacious new Hyundai Accent hatchback. It's got everything you could ever want in a new car: A/C, a CD player, more room than you'd ever imagine, a superb sound system and a very responsive engine that will get you on the freeway - FAST! Its steering is nice and tight and you'll get lots of heads turning as you zip down the road in your new Accent!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Hyundai in 6 years. I usually get a new car every 2 years. Okay, I only paid 9,000 dollars for this car brand new so my review is based on what you get for the money. This car is comfortable and easy to drive. It's very light so it jerks a little on the freeway when being passed an 18 wheeler. The get-up and go isn't very good, but sufficient for a commuter car. I have the 2 door, manual, no air. The styling is nice and there's plenty of leg room for a tall guy like myself. People have complained about the gas mileage. I've filled up 4 times so far and I'm getting 29-31 MPG. I do mostly city driving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently bought my Accent used with 7,000 miles on it. I've owned 5 Hondas but this is a great car so far, for an econobox. Hugs the road. Nicely bolstered seats, plenty of room in back, decent stereo. Love the 16" wheels. Even my "car guy" friends comment on how good the car looks. 32mpg on my 2nd full tank (60% highway/40% street miles). My first full tank was 30mpg. Halfway through the 2nd tank I checked tire pressure and noticed they were slightly low. Mid 20's and the door sticker recommends 32psi. This next full tank may be even better mileage with proper tire pressure. I drive relatively conservatively aiming for good mileage. I agree about the door panels, scratch city!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my car about 2 weeks ago and have put over a 100 miles on it already. It is surprisingly quick but tops out at 75 mph w/o running it too hard. I got the sun & sound package and was glad I did, the stereo is decent for stock and the 6 disc changer is a nice addition and all in the dash. You'll want to go for the sports package because the larger wheels and the shifting is much better than the base model I test drove and the shifting isn't as loose either. Overall I'm glad I made the purchase for the money it's hard to beat and my girlfriend actually says it's nicer than her Honda Civic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought mine in July 2007, and loved the ice blue color, I don't like the placement of the front left windshield pillar, it blocks the view sometimes, first tank of gas was 42 MPG, I drive 20 miles one way to work, currently i get 32-34 MPg but not by driving 75, I go 65 on the freeway, the cars has lots of zip, I had to get the basic model, and really miss the keyless entry and power door locks, so far it's been very dependable, I did notice a slight hesitation after backing up then press on the gas it waits just a sec, then goes, a new car shouldn't do this.prefer the seat back to be more adjustable ie lean further back</TEXT>

<TEXT>My husband and I purchased our Hyudai Accent GLS 4 door sedan right after the Labor Day Holiday. We have now had it for about six weeks and put about 1300 miles on it. Although we have not taken it out of the city yet, we have done both city driving and interstate driving. The Accent handles well is a bit slow does ride almost like a small car but not bad. It takes curves well and parks easily The sound system is nice and there are neat features which surprising are normally found on higher end cars like lighted mirrors, trunk, glove box tilt wheel. The only interior design we do not like is the placement of the cup holders. They should be more up front We are plaesed with our Accent</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very pleased with the Hyundai Accent SE. After comparing it to the Fit, and the Yaris. The Accent SE had all the features I was looking for. Anti-lock brake, front and side air bags and all power. In California you can't buy a Yaris with anti-lock or side curtian. the Fit had all the feature I was looking for, but dealers were asking $3000 over sicker with very little lead way. 18,000. I got the Accent for $13,500 and a $500rebate. I was suprised how will the Accent handled on the road much smoother than I expected. I dose lack some power,but with 110hp what do you expect. Interior is roomy for its size and I like the body stlyeing. For a car in this class it's the best buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First 4 tanks 37,38,37,39 MPG. That is mostly highway averaging 63-65 MPH. My daily commute is 100 miles. Compared to the older Toyota Tercel and Saab I was driving I am thrilled with the ride quality - smooth and quiet. I wanted a Yaris but could not find one with side curtain airbags. I am very happy with the way the car looks (I got in black). I thought I would get the hatchback but the visibilty was not great and since our other vehicle is an FJ Cruiser.......enough said. The tires and wheel covers with the base GLS trim are very nice, not the usual economy car bicycle tires. Under 13K, excellent mileage, standard side airbags (I have a 2 yr old) great warranty...easy decision</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a neat little car! I got a base GS with A/C and the upgraded stereo as the ONLY options. First time I have had crank windows and manual locks since college! The A/C blows COLD in the sticky MN summers and the stereo is great! It's a peppy little city car and it eats up the miles on the freeway with ease. Noisy above 3500 RPM. Takes bumps well for a little car, too. Top gear acceleration with the A/C on takes a little planning, but I knew what I was getting when I bought it. Driving with the driver's window down on the freeway results in amazingly little turbulence. First tank resulted in about 30 mpg in combined driving - looking for more once broken in.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I'm about 6'4" and I have more headroom than in my '00 Durango! Great sounding stereo. Wonderful car around town. Very sharp-looking vehicle. Initial build quality is outstanding!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Since day one this car has continued to impress me. MPG strated at less than expected but has now peaked at 37 MPG. More room than you could imagine from seeing outside. I drive 100 miles every day and is more than comfortable. The elevation at home is about 6500 feet above sea level and work is 9500 feet above sea level. This car has no issues with the hills and is completely fun in the corners. Love it!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a cute little car. It is comfortable and reliable. For the first 11000 miles I got around 27mpg now I am getting 30mpg. This is driving 25 miles to work some back paved roads and some city. My highway driving is around 35mpg. The one thing I am finding is that the tires are not the best in the world. It comes with a 40000 mile tire and are starting to show some wear at 13000 miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really like most everything about this car except for the low quality, hard plastic door panels which scratch so easily. The car handles and steers with great precision. Fuel mileage is not quite what is stated on the sticker. I average 28-30. I doubt I'll ever see 38 on the highway. The car is no dragster but it's right in the pack with the other subcompacts. It's more fun to drive a slow car quickly than a fast car slowly anyway! It's very fun to drive and the speakers sound awesome with my new aftermarket HD stereo. I love the THUNK of the doors when they are shut. they sound like a luxury car. I don't find the car to be overly noisy at highway speeds. It's typical of the class. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am 6'3" and find more than enough room to drive. I am impressed by the interior room and the easy access through the rear door. I found the price outstanding. I elected not to get any thrills such as electric windows and locks so I found the price outstanding. I compared about 7 other cars in the price range and found the Hyundai to be the best buy. I found the vehicle was only about 10-12" shorter than her PT Cruiser but the Access "looks" to be a much smaller vehicle. I am really impressed with the mpg. It is outstanding. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is slow slow slow. It's actually average for it's class, but if you're moving from any recent midsize sedan to this, be prepared to step hard on the accelerator. Having said that, this car is a blast to drive around town. You feel like Mario Andretti as you are weaving in and out of traffic. You can pull a U- turn almost anywhere, and sightlines are excellent. The brakes are also top notch, stopping fast and with good pedal feel. I didn't get great gas mileage on my first tank, but I'm on my second tank and am expecting 30 mpg in entirely city driving. The only complaint I have is with the hard plastic doors. They aren't comfortable and scratch easily.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like my car but if I knew then what I know now I may not have bought it. Keeping in mind that this is an entry level car, they could have added a 6th gear to the tranny. This is a really loud car when driven at US highway speeds (65-75mph), and I'm not talking about the exhaust notes. The engine spins at 3500-4000rpms at these speeds and makes sure you know it. A little sound baffling under the hood and on the firewall would make it a better car to ride in. I still feel that Hyundai offers the best value for your dollar, but I would have paid a little more for a little less engine rpm.</TEXT>

Also, you can not get a large stroller in the trunk, nor can you get a rear-facing car seat in the back without pushing the seat all the way to the front. With that being said, it's got fantastic MPG, great looks, my children and I love to be in it and it was a great price!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Accent Hatchback for one week so far. Do not like the plastic doors. Too easy to scratch. What were they thinking?? Radio only partially worked, dealer had to order me another one, no biggie. Fuel economy on the second tank of gas not living up to its hype. I will give it a month and see what happens. If my Hyundai does not impress me in the first year, I will not buy another one. Too much to choose from that are just like it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hyundai has nothing to envy to the other so called "giant motor companies". I totally impressed with the Hyundai Accent 2007 I bought. This car has style, performance, quality and a superb interior design. Great Job Hyundai!!! you finally are getting the respect you deserve. When I ride my accent 2007 I feel so comfortable inside, every aspect of the interior design was perfected for the driver and passangers. The car has no noise while riding, has a lot of power considering its small engine 1.6, and its super saving gas fuel economy make this car the best of its class. Two thumbs up for Hyundai!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Let me start and say, GET THE SE version! Fog lights - standard! Great when driving in the mountains early in the morning with all that mist. The SE version has so many options - and I know cause when I checked out other models calculating the same specs any of them would have cost 2-4,000 dollars more! The SE sport handling makes a big difference which I noticed caused I compared the GS and the GLS to it in test drives. Power handling, leather trim-both the wheel and transmission shifter - standard!The 16" inch tires didn't hurt either and helped with the handling. I love this car. I have read all the reviews on Yahoo Autos,MSN,Cars.com, Edmunds and it comes down to this drive one first!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>5 - year road side assistance and to top it off, the toll-free number is written right on the glass - so no fumbling for a manual if something happens! That goes to show you the thought put into this vehicle. The fabric is quite nice ( I got black) and back seat headroom for this 6'4" was good!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> I ordered an Yaris LB with the color I wanted, accessories alone are $4,400. Got the 18" TRD Sport wheels + Sportivo suspension and rear spoiler. It cost like 15,700 w/o power windows, no keyless entry, no 60/40 seats. Luckily, they couldnt find it. For the same price, I took the Accent SE. Bigger engine, bigger space at the back, 9 airbags, Tachometer (really helps save gas) since I took 5 speed stick, sunroof, 6CD in-dash player, keyless entry, 16"alloy wheels, 8 position adjustable seats, 60/40 folding back seats, accent matting and with spoilers and fog lamps. for the SAME PRICE.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car for almost a month now and have driven 700 miles. With about 80% of my driving being on the highway, I've averaged about 17-19 MPG. I'm a recent college grad and saved most of my money specifically for this car, so obviously my disappointment level is high so far. Although, I've heard that the break-in period is anywhere between 1,500 and 5,000 miles so I'm hoping it gets dramatically better. However, this is a beautiful looking car. The interior is spacious and you don't feel cramped at all. It would be the perfect car if only the MPG was anything close to what is advertised. I keep the car around 55 or lower, so that can't be the reason for the poor MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Much better car than previous model (traded in a 2001 hatchback 5-sp that we were overall very happy with, including good MPG): it looks good, is solidly built, fun to drive, and has a very nice interior. But right from the start, with mostly highway driving, we only got a poor 23-25 MPG (U.S. gal.). Looking at website reviews, most owners get the rated 35+ MPG, but 3 reviews describe the same problem and same answer by dealerships: a ?longer break-in? is needed to get good MPG. Now, at 5000 miles (and after dealer tried fixing by changing spark plugs) MPG is still the same. Seems Hyundai may have a problem with a small percentage of Accents that they haven't yet figured out and/or admitted.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one fine little car that does everything that I ask of it. It's not a drag racer, but it gets up to speed in a deceivingly smooth manner. It will cruise nicely on the freeways at 70+, and is agile in city traffic. Its size makes it easier to find parking a space. Hyundai packed a lot of room inside this coupe. Every instrument, knob and lever is located where the driver expects to find it. Gas mileage is excellent, as advertised. The air conditioning does its job well, and road noise is not an issue. At about $14K delivered, this car is inexpensive but it certainly is not "cheap." People can look at my little blue Hyundai coupe, but they will just have to go find their own!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The overall quality of the car is excellent. I wanted a small, economic comfortable car with air conditioning and an automatic transmission for city and suburban driving. I've got it! As an unexpected bonus, it's great on the freeways too!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At first, the car didn't really turn my head, but after driving it for a month, WOW, it's automatic and it gives me more than 30 miles per gallon, it's a drive so friendly and soft, you think you're in a car of a better class. And I found out the reasons why: independent suspension on the four wheels, CVVT fuel injection. Plus nice room and cup holders for every one, pretty nice stereo, all this for a low price. Driving it through curves and hills is very easy, though not a fast thrill, but it really drives like a small premium car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've had the car a little more than a week and since we bought it specifically for the mileage... we're not impressed. We drive about 500 miles a week to/from work and was hoping for closer to 40 mpg than 30 mpg. Also, since these are mostly highway miles.. we really thought it would do better. Otherwise, we are pleased with the leg/head room, 'peppyness', and my husband said "It WILL do 120 mph" and handled very well while doing so... no 'floating'. It really stayed grounded.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After three days of driving my brand new car (200 miles) I noticed a delay in my transmission when I shifted it from reverse to drive. I also noticed the gas gauge went from full to empty way too quick. Took it in to the dealer and as per Hyundai's suggestion, the dealer replaced the transmission and gas tank sending unit. After 2000 miles the speedometer won't drop all the way to zero and the alignment is off. Broke my heart as this was my first new car I have bought in over twelve years. The dealer wouldn't replace the car when I took it in. Why would he he got his money? Hyundai said sorry, but that was it. Learned my lesson that Honda and Toyota are worth the premium price.</TEXT>

But, have found this car pretty peppy and responsive. The SE is loaded with sunroof and CD(6). My previous Accent was very sporty and I just loved it. Talked my husband into getting the Elantra Limited. Now he's a fan! Never had a problem with my 2001. I expect the same from my 2007 Accent.

It is surprisingly roomy and very comfortable. It's exterior styling is sporty rather than the usual vanilla bargain basement look of other cars in this price range. The interior design is well thought-out and the materials and craftsmanship far exceeded my expectations. It accelerates to highway speeds effortlessly even with the automatic transmission however while accelerating hard the little 4 cylinder does sound a bit ?busy?however All in all it is a great little car!</TEXT>
