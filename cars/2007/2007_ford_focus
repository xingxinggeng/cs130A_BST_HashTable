<TEXT>Pretty reliable : no issues in 36k. Has good pep, handles quite well, is well laid out inside, is roomy. Base seats are awful, gas mileage is so-so, and somewhat noisy inside (but I'll take that as a trade off for a lighter more nimble car that does not need 200 hp to move)</TEXT>

<TEXT>Lots of things broken or falling apart on this car after only tw and half years. Today we had to replace the ignition switch as it locked down on the key and wouldnt release it. To the tune of $almost $400 bucks at the dealer. Their comment was , "This is a common problem on the Focus and Fusion'. Yeah, Ford=Fix Or Repair Daily.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Not bad gas mileage at around 30 highway. Ride is not that great and power stinks. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this car used for my wife for daily commute to work. It had around 22000 miles. Within four months of owning the Ford, the tires were bald and the alternator had to be replaced three times because it kept shorting out. The front rotors were alos bad we were told. On top of this my insurance company charges more to insure this model of car. </TEXT>

<TEXT> My brother inherited a basic 2007 Focus sedan in 2007. He took me for a drive and was I ever impressed. I then purchased a 2007 Focus SES sedan to drive to work and have been very satisfied ever since. I am 6' 2" and still I have more than enough room. The storage and interior are very well planned. Fold-down 60/40 rear seats permit the storage of some large cargo. My wife usually dislikes small cars but she loves the Focus. I purchased the premium seats and they are quite comfortable on long trips. I have driven 40k miles without any problems. The dealer has maintained the car according to the recommended schedule. Replacement parts such as filters are very inexpensive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent gas mileage if you use a good 87 octane gas such as BP. My Focus mileage suffers a bit if I buy cheaper gas. This situation has not been the case with other cars I have owned. Heated seats in winter weather. You'll be money ahead if you get antilock brakes and better suspension. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When my old Tracer wagon died, I couldn't find anything in my price range. In NYC at the time, car dealers were selling foreign cars and luxury cars. My husband finally found a Ford dealer with a few Focuses on the lot. All I had to do was sit in the drivers seat, and fell in love. It felt like my Tracer, with controls easily accessible, excellent comfort for my bad back, and great fuel mileage for the rapdidly increasing fuel costs. Add to that the low cost, and it beat out the Toyotas, Mazda 3 and 6, and Honda Civic hands down. I would have considered it a bargain even without the $2500 rebate and excellent financing I was able to obtain.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort in all seats, good leg room in rear, even for my teenagers. Great color options, (Where else can you get Aqua? I can find my Focus in any parking lot!) Great gas milage, with over 32 MPG fully loaded on trips, over 30 with normal driving. Trunk space is much larger than others in its class.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought this for our daughter when she graduated from high school. It's a great little car and gets excellent gas mileage. She drove to Florida last August to do a internship at Walt Disney World and just this month her father and I flew to Orlando to drive back home with her. Lots of room in the vehicle and my husband is over 6'. My only complaint is that when we went to come home we had the oil changed and noticed the rear tires were completely bald, front tires still looked good so we had the front tires put on the back and new ones on the front. Drove 1500 miles and now the rear tires are bald. I will never own another set of Pirellis. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased this vehicle after owning a 2000 Focus LX. Our new coupe looked great in red with black cloth interior. We paid about $16k BUT were very impressed with the improvements made over the 2000 model. The interior quality is much improved, as is the sound deadening, ride, handling, and POWER. The DOHC 2.0L offers plenty of mid-range torque with an impressive intake growl. The brakes are good, but lack anti-lock. The stock sound system is adequate. The vehicle handles VERY well for its class; it is difficult to lose grip even in the wet. Replaced alternator at 48,000 miles ($220 from AutoZone), and a front marker lamp at 44,000 miles. Overall, we love the looks and performance.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Intake note, equipment-to-price ratio, plenty of interior storage, sweet wheel and tire combo, great seats, decent sound system, lots of room in the back seat, even for a relatively tall person. Foglamps are quite bright. Lots of compliments on thestyling. Ice-cold A/C. Flex- antenna on roof!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Best car buying experience I have ever had, no contest. Salesman and dealer were superb. The car is fabulous. Compared to my wife's Scion, this car cost the same and is much, ,more. No comparison. And the Scion is a nice car. Generous factory rebate of $2500. I bought my beautiful light blue Focus hatchback for less than $12,000. No money out of pocket. Car is fun and sportscar like. Ford is stupidly dropping the hatchback. Go get one while you can!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After a trying three years of ownership with an 02 Focus, I decided to give it another go with an 07. I've had the car for a day so far. Performance is good, comfort is good, a very good value for the money. Long range reliability isn't promising, so get an extended warranty that covers more than powertrain - you won't regret it. My 02 was great until it 50k - it was all downhill for the last 22k miles of ownership with that car. With the 07's, the SE and SES are the best values if you want A/C.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got this car in the past few days as a replacement for another vehicle. I have found that this cars basic features are better than the same type cars in its class and I have no problems with this car so far. I did a great deal of research on this car and liked the MPG and the way it handles on the road. I have the added features of cruise control and side air bags that my last 2007 vehicle did not have plus that same gas savings even with the added horse power. Not as costly as a Toyota in the same class and is a better car than the 2007 Yaris that I had to replace. I would highly recommend this car for anyone looking for a fun way to get from here to there with good dependability.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior space throughout and the rear seat pulls up with the seat backs laying down flat. Great SE features. Great safety features that will protect from bad drivers. Great Ford service and incentives.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well right after my first review, the gas mileage took a nose dive down to the low 20's. Ford won't address this issue until 10,000 miles. Still fun to drive though. I had a squeak too, dealer said it was a something to do with the parking brake sleeve?</TEXT>

<TEXT>3 months, 4500 miles so far. Mileage is 32 highway with cruise control at 75 mph, 26 around town. Far better than my old Ranger, but less than EPA unrealistic estimates. No mechanical troubles or noises. Plenty of room in rear seat for most people. Handles very well around corners, much better than anything else I've owned. Pirelli P6 tires are quiet, but track pavement grooves. Acceleration is good for this size car, low end torque is also good. Go through the gears and be in 5th by 40 mph. Brakes good. I have the safety package with side seat airbags, haven't been able to find seat covers that don't interfere with airbags. Sun visors are wimpy and look too cheap. Overall very pleased.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The little ZX3 is not a Mazda 3 but it is its less expensive cousin with the almost same 2.0 engine less the vvt. Too bad that Ford is replacing the hatch back in 08 with a coupe, but maybe it will drive just as well. I am getting 25 mpg in town and on a trip across California and Arizona on the interstate, I got 30 mpg average on a 400 mile trip, and my ZX is an automatic. I have only had it for a few months but they have been trouble free, and Ford now has a 5 year 60K warranty just in case. It's a solid little car for the price. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have not had this car for but a few days, but it is the neatest and best equipped car you can get for the money. We have a black SE sedan with the auto trans, tilt/telescoping wheel, speed control and the sport group, which includes the T-rated tires and multi-spoke alloy wheels and fog lamps, tach and leather wrapped steering wheel. The anti-theft as standard is a delight. The car has the 50-state emissions 2.0L, but the power is right where you need it on our two-lane hilly roads. It is a really nice handling and power combination for the 55-75 mph range. We stepped up from a Contour, we've had two. It is a step up in every way, and not much smaller of a car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The roadholding and powerband coordination in the 55-75 mph range on hilly two lanes. The CD/radio. The seats. The charisma of the pitch black exterior and tinted windows with the multi-spoke alloy wheels. Comfortable driving/control position. The smooth ride but still sporty.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is probably the last affordable station wagon that provides what stations are supposed to: space, with a lot of fuel economy, without paying for the performance of the car. My only complaint would be about the interior design where a few more compartments could be added, and the quality of the materials could be higher. It would be great if all the accessories offered on the British version of this car were available.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When gas prices looked like they wouldn't be headed below $3 per gallon last summer, I started looking for a more fuel-efficient car to replace my Saturn VUE. In the past year, I've had opportunities to drive several small cars (Focus, Civic, Mazda3) and midsizers (Fusion, Mazda6, Accord, G6, Maxima). In my book, the Focus and Mazda3 were at the top of the list where driving dynamics are concerned. Since I'm 6'3" tall, head and leg room are big considerations in a small car - - and the Focus fit me better than any other in the class. Add to that the incentives on the Focus and the fact that I live in a state (MI) that's rather dependent on Ford's business success, and the choice is made.</TEXT>

I purchased a '07 SES a month ago and am completely satisfied thus far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As far as driving goes, it's kinda "spunky". I'm getting over my loss on a nice '95 Mustang GT. But, this little car has surprised me. It's a base model 5-speed. So far the only thing I'm complaining about is a slight engine tapping/knocking. Which I'm still yet to get checked out. But overall, she looks very promising for future modifications.</TEXT>

I love every feature of the car, from the way it handles around corners, to the built in sub woofer. 151 hp and a tuned suspension and makes driving through the winding mountain roads feel like a roller coaster. And the street appearance package makes people's heads turn - it looks fast. This was a great investment and the price was just right. I would recommend this car to anyone.</TEXT>

I would expect that to improve after the first 1000-3000 miles. The car has a ton of zip around town and the highway. It's nice and quiet and just fun to drive.

I wanted something smaller that would serve my purposes. This Focus Hatchback has exceeded my expectations. It is fun to drive and the 4 cylinder Mazda engine is extremely quiet and it will haul you away from a stop that will leave other drivers wondering what's under the hood.

<TEXT>After several test drives of vehicles in this class of car (be realistic and don't expect a Toyota Avalon) it seemed to be the best choice. I was looking for a run here run there car. At 1500 miles average about 27 mpg rural/highway mileage. I don't live near large city so no actual city miles. Good road feel, handling and ride for compact car. Power sufficient (2.0L auto) even in hilly area of PA but does have to downshift often. Only problem was towed back to dealer when engine shut off and wouldn't restart.Took dealer 2 days to fix problem. Don't believe this to be a common problem. Matter of fact tow operator did state Focus is not high on his list of customers but lowered my reliability rating. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good ride, handling and road feel for inexpensive compact car. $2500 rebate on 2007 Focus allows you to get a 2007 Focus very nicely equipped for a good price.

<TEXT>I traded a 2002 PT Cruiser with 73,000 miles for this car after having starting problems with the Cruiser and the locking device going haywire--locking and unlocking by itself. So far, I really enjoy this Ford Focus more than I did the Cruiser. Granted, I miss the retro look. But, the Focus has a great European style design. It kind of reminds me of some Volvos I have seen around town. It brakes extremely well, and has a quick take off for a 4 cylinder. It gets better gas mileage than the Cruiser I had. Also, it handles much better than a 2000 Neon that I also owned previously. I can feel weight to the car as I drive it, and I like that. It corners well, and I don't feel excessive leaning.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I took a large loss trading in my suv in order to get the boldly advertised mpg rating of 27-37. After a month I find I am getting 25mpg. The car is fun and cute and good value for what it is, but people are buying these cars for the mileage and Ford is severely misrepresenting the mpg estimates on the Focus. It's more like mpg fantasies. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My 93 Escort GT was on its last legs, due to an accident. It would have made it a couple more years without a doubt. Alas, it was not meant to be. Thus a search for a suitable replacement began. Toyota Yaris, Honda Fit, Chevy Aveo, etc. Final solution: Focus ZX4 SE with almost every option, except cold weather package, and 16" wheels. X plan and $2500.00 rebate plus a little trade in equaled about $14k. A similarly equipped Honda Civic - well over $20k. No-brainer. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior comfortable, solid, quiet at all speeds. Very ergonomic, not goofy like the Yaris. Pull the front seats up a notch, plenty of room for backseat drivers. Large trunk. Back seat bottom cushions flip up like Honda Fit. Backs fold down flat. Oil filter in plain sight, easy to reach.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned my little car only 2 weeks but it is a blast to drive so far. I traded in my 2000 Ford Ranger pickup truck for something smaller with better gas mileage. I researched every car in the hatchback category and narrowed my choice to the Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris, and the Ford Focus. For the money, the Focus was the best value for me. Yes, the trade-in value will be lower than the others, but for the years I will be driving it, I have more features, a great design, and a reliable history. Plus, Ford gave $2k in rebates that made the price perfect.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great acceleration, nice design, spacious for a big driver like me, lots of little areas for storage, smooth ride on the highway, handy for small parking spaces, lots of storage in the back (I don't usually have passengers - just stuff).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My husband and I got this car less than two years ago brand new. We only use it for commuting to work so it has low mileage. It doesn't get the posted fuel economy.. 6 months ago it started shuddering at stops. They told us it was a transmission leak and supposedly fixed it. Two weeks ago it began dying at stops so they replaced a tranny gasket. Now only two weeks later, its shuddering, dying, and has a fast leak of transmission fluid puddling everywhere. We can smell it as we drive, too. Ford is putting a bandaid on a big hidden problem and we're thinking of trading this lemon in before the warranty is out and we're stuck replacing a transmission out of pocket.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like this car. I bought it used with 17k on it. I'm 6'2" and it's cramped inside a little. This is definitely a little person car. There a no power amenities. Reminds me of my old Ford Escort. It seems like the same size but I put on weight about 50 lbs, so this car is gonna make me skinny again. Overall a steal for under 15 thou. Good gas milage, handles well. But they need to do a factory recall on the gas cap. Almost every review I read about this car complaims about the smell of gas. I had to take mine back to the dealer and he tightened it up and reset the codes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Focus. At 40K miles, the stock 6 CD player started draining the battery, causing me to need jumps as long as the main fuse allowed power to the radio/Cd. I spoke with Ford - not covered. Nearly new car, dying nightly, now working again only because I pulled the fuse. Ford is aware of the issue, but won't work it. This has soured me on Ford, and the Focus, and I won;t be buying another FMC product.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wrote a review on here not too long ago and I have read some of the reviews on here. I'm sorry to hear that some people had problems with Pirelli tires. I didn't have to replace 2 of them until I was just over 45,000 miles on my car, and that's after my driving like a bat out of hell . Besides regular maintenance, I only had to replace a tail light bulb. The performance of the car is awesome- I can outrun many cars when I need to! It's always fun to drive, especially fast! With all of this, I'm getting on average 30 to 32mpg and when I chill out from going fast I get as much as 38mpg. Totally worth the purchase! I'm not planning to buy another car anytime soon. I made a great choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>3rd one. Have rented a variety of vehicles for our trips. Drove my 1st Focus and said ?I want this this car?. Brought one in 1998, then in 2000 (had over 200,000 miles w/no problems) and then traded it in for my third one. Travel about 120 miles a day and just thought it was time, each was an exceptional car. For a compact car it?s versatility is good, plently of room, especially head room. I recomend this car for fuel efficency, good city MPG/very good hwy MPG, has good accelertion. Nice riding car and very comfortable on trips. It?s underpriced considering its quality and reliablity. It?s everything I needed and more. When I?m ready to trade-in for a new vehicle, it will be another Focus!</TEXT>

We also spent only $380 in gas (Aug 08). I have the mileage up to 40 mpg. The only thing I have had to replace (besides maintence items) was a blinker bulb for $1.41. I have owned a lot of cars including a Volvo and a Lexus and several Hondas and this has been by far the best car I have owned.

<TEXT>I have the 2007 ST - a special performance model. The 2.3 L engine delivers good power (151 HP) and great torque (154 lbs) at a low rpm. It is more than adequate, better still can be easily improved. The car's upgraded suspension handles great at high speeds and is still comfortable to drive. It's very stable and responsive (the euro spec ST & SVT heritage helps here). Brakes are also very good with 4 wheel disk and ABS. Winter driving is helped by the traction control, heated seats & mirrors. Summer is fun w/ the sunroof, A/C & the great sounding Sony speakers and tuned stereo with a sub. I found the car very well optioned for the price. I look forward to drive it as much as possible.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It may seem silly, but the removable cup holders ended up being quite the lifesaver! Fast turns and sharp braking always caused my coffee to spill over, and now cleaning is a snap! Just take the cupholder out after work and pop it into the dishwasher. Awesome idea, wonder why my other cars didn't have this feature. The major flaw I found is that the paint is scratched and chipped way too easily. New scratches seem to appear out nowhere everyday! Everything else on this car is solid, and this car is definitely underpriced considering its build quality, reliability, and amusing driving experience. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second ZX3. My first '07 was totaled in March. Both of these cars are/were 5 speed S models. The only option on both was A/C. I have gotten 39 to 40 mpg on both these cars without running the air. With the A/C on I get 34 to 35. This car is a lot of fun to drive and the only negative comment would be the road noise-- it's not a problem on good roads. Maybe Ford will make another hatchback soon. The second one had Goodyears the first Hankook tires. The Goodyears are not as quiet but they are holding up well at 17,500 miles. This is a great car for the money.

<TEXT>Best mileage so far is 36.5 MPG. Five speed manual shifts easily. On open road, car interior is very noisey (road noise), and is the only downside. Fit and finish was ok since hatch was not aligned very well from factory. Placement of the aux power receptacle is questionable since located very high on the dash. I use the car for basic commute averaging 75 miles per day. Unfortunate that Ford decided to discontinue the hatch. Smaller engine (1.5 liter )and taller gears (2 thru 6 instead of 1 thru 5) would have made great mileage candidate. Advertised split rear seat refers to seat back only, and not seat bottom, so not truely a split seat configuration. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car new so that I could commute to college in something that would get me many miles in few gallons and not break down. The Focus actually feels solid and made of steel unlike the Corolla, and the Sentra is lethargic and boring. I've enjoyed taking on twisties and downshifting to 3rd for passing, the manual transmission is great. The pickup is good too, first gear loves to move and all the others do so as well at the right time. Snow performance was awesome, you'd be amazed at what a little momemtum can do. My sister's 4WD Jeep got stuck in the same driveway in 10 inches of snow that my FWD Focus took like a champ. The looks combine both youth and maturity, and it works well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2007 SES sedan 5MT. This car was purchased as a commuter car to keep from putting so many miles on the Mustang and to do my part to help reduce my carbon footprint. Purchased for its base cost, fuel economy, and because it's a Ford (I'm a Ford guy). So far (after 7 months and 14,000 miles) it has met my expectations for an economy car. Fuel economy has been between 30 and 37 mpg, and power, although not overwhelming, is acceptable with the 5-speed. Styling is more grown-up than the 1st-gen and the current Focus. Everything works like it should. My cars are all well- maintained, so I'm interested in how this one holds up over the years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned full size cars all my life. This is the fisrt small car I ever had and I love it! Very sporty and comfortable. It has amazing power out of the hole and on hills. Which most small cars need 2 miles to get up to 55 mph. Talking about being small, it's not at all. The room in the cabin is incredible! The seats and controls are very comfortable to sit and reach, well thought out. Even though gas is $3.20 per gal. I still just drive to nowhere because it's so much fun to drive, even on a long trip. Very happy with my zx4 Ses Focus (2007)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 1996 Contour and bought this car 9 months ago as a replacement and already have put 10k in miles on it. I have not been disappointed. The car gets great gas mileage. I drove from Raleigh to DC on 7.5 gallons! You can seriously get 36mpg if you stay around 65mph. I found you get around 30mpg 70mph+. I love the way this car handles and the smoothness of it when I drive. I seriously feel like I'm driving a car that is worth 2x as much as I paid. The only downside I have is the interior leg room. I'm 5'9" and I have the set pushed all the way back. There is no way I'll ever be able to push those rear seats down for extra cargo space and be able to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this (new) because I needed a cheap commuter car to get to work. I bought the most basic, bare bones Focus I could get and was able to get it for under 10,000. I got the 5-speed manual and if driven smartly I get about 41mpg highway and about 35mpg city. No joke, I track it very closely as money is tight. With rising gas prices, this car is a life saver on gas. I highly recommend this if you're a college stuff, like myself, or want a very reliable basic car with great gas mileage. I drove this vehicle the day after I bought it from San Jose, CA all the way to Atlanta, GA and had absolutely no problems anywhere along the way (52hr trip, no stops except for gas). Great buy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased new as 'around town' car, specifically for good gas mileage. Haven't gotten it. Averaging about 23 mpg combined, and under 30 on highway only (driver and one passenger only). Interior is cramped for older people, difficult to enter/exit as door sills are quite high. Front seat legroom is very limited (tho seemed OK during the test drive). Front storage/conveniences quite limited: any beverage in cup holders is prone to spill/tip as driver and passenger legs have no where else to go. Wipers are quiet. Radio is good. Steering/handling is good/fun. Sporty handling. Very poor gas mileage. Recommend against this car for anyone 5'10" or more, or over 200 lbs, or anyone buying for mpg.</TEXT>

Creaking and groaning noises from rear axle, shock area. Dealer cant find the problem. Gas mileage is 22mpg city and 27mpg highway. Only 3000 miles so far. Paid 13,300, has side airbag pkg. Paid extra for extended warranty and premium maintanance plans. Gas mileage is 22- 23city and 27 highway. Not good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted a car which would fulfill both my need for speed and be attainable on a modest budget. One of the things I was really looking for was a stickshift. I got this car used with just 8K miles on it and fully loaded for a song. I have ended up driving it 1.5K miles in 2weeks. This is living the very busy life of a medical resident with only a few free hours daily which i have enjoyed spending with this car. I love the handling and the feel of the car and the acceleration and power is more than sufficient to easily exceed legal speeds. This car is fully loaded and I love all the creature comforts.

Well I couldn't pass up the rebates, end of model incentives, and the price.

It's probably the best handling car I've owned even better than the Honda I used to have. I've never owned a Ford before but I'm definitely impressed with this car and will buy another Ford.

<TEXT>I love this car! Had it coming up on 2 years and haven't had one ioda of a problem with it. Never been serviced (Helps dad owns on muffler shop) or had it back at the dealership. I was really skeptical buying this as I wasn't impressed with Focus's of the past besides the SVT. So when I was told this was the car that discountinued the SVT, I had to test it out. I walked out 2 hours later a proud owner! The interior is a little bland and my leg rubs against the center console, besides that I fit in there like a glove and I am 6'1 280. So not small. Also this car goes! I have done a couple small things and doing about 175hp and doing 14.1 in 1/4. I love the looks on other peoples faces! :)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The red inserts in the seats,carbon fiber dash, peppy 5-speed and easy to mod. Handles like a dream, turns on a dime! I have the look of an SES, cause I hate the big gaudy wing and groundeffects are for kids. This car makes bold moves!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I find the Focus wagon to be just about the right size for all my needs. It can carry 5 passengers, though the back seat might be a little cramped for large people. With the back seat folded down, it can carry a surprisely big load. It handles nicely in all traffic situations. It has plenty of get-up and go. Merging into expressway traffic is no problem at all. At highway speeds (I tend to have a heavy foot) I average about 32mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I guess my favorite feature is the amount of room in the back with the back seat folded down. I also like the remote locks. To me the darn car just looks very good. I like its looks better than the sedan's. Ford should have advertised it more. It's just the right size for a couple of retirees.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A surprising car. The 2.0 is significantly faster than my beloved 2003 Protege ES. The ride is nice and soft, yet the car handles really well. There is a lot of body roll during spirited driving, but this isn't a performance model. Big truck easily fits a lawn mower. Soft seats, decent dead pedal placement, high seating position. If you don't care about looks, this is the best American car. Better than Neon and Cobalt Now the bad: This is an ugly little car. It looks like something poor people would drive in the former Soviet Union. Also, the interior is cheap and ugly, and after a while the plastic starts to smell. The engine sounds really weak, and the transmission shifts oddly at times</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car after relocating across the country, and having to leave my old ride for the vultures. Needed a car that would fit the bill to haul all manner of awkward cargo and serve car- pool duty for my 80 mile (each way) commute. At 8 months and 18,000 miles in, my Focus has peformed reliably and without complaint. Not the nicest car in the segment, but for just over $14K, I got a 5 door hatchback with all the conveniences expected from a modern car, including the optional ABS and front side airbags, along with cruise control and a tilt/telescoping steering wheel. The driver's seat has so far proved comfortable for my 6'1" frame on drives up to 400 miles with no aches or pains.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fold-flat rear seats creates a large cargo area, suitable for everything from 2-3 bikes to smaller bits of furniture. At speeds of 75-80 mph, fuel economy comes in at a consistent 31-33 MPG, even in hilly and windy conditions. Zippy performance in urban driving. Standard CD Mp3 is handy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After considering the much more expensive Honda, Toyota, and Mazda, I decided to buy a Focus. Besides, I believed Ford earned my business with their commitment to quality. This car is well thought out. Like others have said, it is small on the outside, but feels roomy on the inside. At 6'2" and 250 lbs., I feel comfortable. And yes, I can get into and out of the back seat painlessly. Yep, I did consider the Cobalt out of the other American cars. But, in my opinion, it is not nearly as good- looking. I'm getting 32-36 mpg with the fun-to-drive stick. And, it'll probably get better, as the car has just 2K on it. </TEXT>

I plan to eventually add minor performance from Steeda and maybe in the future buy a 2005 Saleen Focus. 150 horsepower 150 lb ft tq with an all aluminum I-4.

I didn't think a 2.0L 4- cylinder could accelerate fast enough or have enough high end torque to hold my own in Orlando traffic, but I've been proven wrong. Not only that, but for my first full tank of gas I got 35 mpg. Not too shabby at all. </TEXT>

We are averaging 27-28 mpg city driving and 35-37 mpg on the highway. Seats are very comfortable for these two senior citizens. Lots of trunk and cargo area. The styling on these focuses are superior to any I have test drove or looked at. The 4 cyl engine has plenty of get and go and you will be driving at 75 mph and not even realize it. Very good acceleration. Very good braking action and stopping distances. Interior is laid very well placed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far I'm getting about 34 to 35 mpg on standard 5-speed. It seems wider and is higher than my Escort wagon, which I prefer. I think it is a good value compared to others on the market. For me, if it's not a Ford, it's not a car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Ford Focus! One of the best features is the SecureLock Anti-Theft system- without a programmed key, no key will work in the ignition switch! I love the look, feel, and the way that the car drives. My gas mileage for right now is a bit sluggish. I'm averaging between 290 and 330 miles per tank, which isn't very much with my automatic. But I have less than 5000 miles on it so I believe it will improve. This car is certainly worth the money, and for me being a college student, this was the perfect fit for my first new car. This was the perfect upgrade from my 1993 Toyota Camry that was dying out on me. Certainly worth the buy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far, I'm one month into ownership of my '07 ZX3 SE. No major issues, however there have been fit and finish issues. One of the wheel nut covers from the hubcap flew off and the head restraints wouldn't stay up. The dealer has been excellent with resolving these issues. Overall, the interior feels cheaper than the old '02 Focus with regards to small details like the radio display. Otherwise, car is holding up well and I'm very happy with it. Long term reliability isn't promising. Let's hope Ford surprises me - My expectations are low.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is very fun to drive. With the 5 speed manual transmission it makes it very fun, and it also can hold its own for speed. I am very happy with the car. The build is more lower scale trim, but, you get what you pay for. And for the money, it's a very good car with all the options.</TEXT>
