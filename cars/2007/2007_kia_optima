<TEXT>I purchased this this vehicle used in April of 2009 with 23500 miles. Since then I had two problems, both front sway links need to be replaced and one of the rear brake was worn unevenly. Took numerous visit to repair shops over two months to figure out the brake issue (car was squeaking periodically when moving - was driving me crazy). The bad sway links were covered under Kia warranty. Since the repairs, the car has been running fine. The dealership was very professional in fixing the problem. Car now has 33000 miles on it. P.S. - trunk sometime open by it own. Happen to me about 4 times in 5 months. Also, averaging 27 miles per gallon with 80% stop/go driving - </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1)Interior styling, great seats in front. Very roomy in back per my co- workers. 2)Air conditioner is excellent. 3)Good performance for a 2.4 V4 engine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We now have over 31,000 on it, and it was trouble free. Had some initial issues, but once the problems with the air bag were resolved it has been perfect. All I do is change the oil, filters and tranny fluid. Good mileage, everything works and it's so far the best car I have ever owned. I have been driving since 1957 so you can see that I have a lot of experience with cars.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior, and the overall styling. Great ride on the interstates and the climate control.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Transmission and engine problems abound in some of these reviews. My wife drives the car most of the time and has had a transmission flush done because she though the transmission was "funny". No more tranny complaints. I drive 80+ miles to work each way and got 35+ MPG maintaining 55 to 62 MPH. No problems other than a rattle in the overhead reading lamps which the dealer took care of promptly. Car now has 42000 miles and runs even better. First 5000 miles or so the car seemed to struggle in cruise control as the engine raced to maintain speed. However, car no longer misses a beat except for the steepest inclines.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My beautiful, dependable and comfortable kia optima ex is the best and most dependable car I have ever owned. It has all the conveniences I can think of, it gets good gas mileage and it never breaks down. I have had complete strangers compliment it's styling, I have gotten as much as 40.7 mpg on one trip, and after 31,000 miles it still runs like a Swiss watch. Perfect and quiet. It also handles very nicely. In other words... For the price, in it's field, it is simply perfect. A ten in every way.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car brand new with 7 miles on it. My 2007 Kia Optima has went through four different automatic transmissions. Kia will refuse to fix their defective car until you threaten legal action and then all the sudden they agree to pop in yet another transmission. My head gasket has blown twice and the car leaks oil and transmission fluid. I'm afraid to turn the car off sometimes because I seriously wonder if the thing will blow up the next time because it's so poorly made.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our Kia Optima 12/26/07, big mistake, not to long after we started having trouble. Started out with the trunk opening up either going down the road or while it was parked. Hesitation driving between 40 & 55, then the lifters started making noise. Cruise control came on for no reason, & the list goes on. We took it to the dealer many times & they just told us that they couldn't duplicate the problem so nothing was wrong with it. We finally took it to a certified mechanic & found the problem in a couple of hours, that the service department where we bought the car didn't/wouldn't find. Resale value is in the dump. It's not worth the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned seven cars in my life and my Kia Optima is by far the worst car I have ever owned. I am on my third automatic transmission. Looking at the other reviews my engine will likely die soon. Please avoid this car, it's awful. Hyundai told me I did not service the vehicle at the dealership and they refused to replace the transmission the third time. I was on the hook for a rebuilt tranny which was over $2,500.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nothing. This car is pure junk. It has left me stranded five different times. 1. Starter died. 2. Transmission died. 3. Head gasket 4. Another starter died. 5. Transmission died</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased our Kia Optima LX with only 11 miles on it. Not very much longer we started having trouble with the trunk coming open either driving down the road or sitting still, then we started having trouble with hesitation between 40 & 50 mph. It just seem like it was one thing after another along with the cruise control coming on by itself & air-bag wasn't working, lifter rattling, burning smell after the engine was shut off. Took it to the dealer many, many times & they said that they couldn't duplicate the problem so there was noting wrong with it. Kia said that they would not replace anything on the car, but they replaced the BCM without asking us & it still didn't help.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought New in 2007 since standard safety features like curtain airbags, stability control etc were unavailable on other more pricey sedans. No problems at all with the car, just with the driver. Very roomy. Im 6'4 and am very impressed with the leg, and knee room. Steering wheel audio controls are great, intuitive. Very smooth transmission. Great headlights, halogen etc. I should have gotten the sunroof. Would definetily look for a used one if this one gets wrecked. Cant beat Kia or Hyundai for the money. Easily competes with camry. Highly recommended. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had nothing but problems with my 2007 Kia Optima. The warranty is useless as you have to jump though hoops and pay crazy costs just to keep up the warranty. They recently replaced both my engine and transmission and the car runs awful. The dealership says that they have performed all the work that Kia would re-imburse them for.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well I am on my third automatic transmission. The first replacement was under warranty but the latest one cost me 2500 bucks. What happened to the "Best Warranty in America"? Totally bogus. This car has horrible build quality. Mechanically this car has by far been the worst vehicle I have ever owned. Starters go out and leave you stranded, unable to start the car. Even with synthetic oil changed every 3,000 miles my engine had to be replaced at 65,000 miles. My neighbor has the exact same car as me and he's had even worse luck mechanically with the car so I should consider myself lucky I guess.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2007 Kia Optima brand new. The car was great for the first 18 months. But this car is the worst vehicle I've ever owned. My automatic transmission went out at 60,076 miles. It seized up and left me stranded in the Arizona desert. My starter went out soon after. Engine was replaced just before 65,000 miles. The car has horrible resale value.

<TEXT>Was looking for a 2006 Hyundai sonata used then found this beauty which is a 2007 and got a way better price than the 2006 sonata and car is very similar. Has the same engine as the sonata and a better 5 speed auto trans sonata has 4 speed. This car gets better fuel economy than the sonata. The sonata does have a quieter and smoother ride however not as sporty on the turns as this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power is awesome for a four cylinder. Blows away my 2005 Hyundai sonata. Seems Kia's are getting better ever since Hyundai bought them out. Thanks Hyundai! Kia's hold the value terribly making these cars a used car best bet for value. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned this car for one year today, and I love it more and more each day that I get behind that wheel. I hate to say that my baby has had to be in the shop a total of 8 times now. That is all do to the dealer that I bought it from. It got so bad, that I had to find a better dealership. There are a few things that are going wrong, and I am hopeful that they will be fixed right this time. The air bags in the front passenger side work when they want, the gas mileage is something all on its own, and the rear end is now having some problems that I have been waiting for to be fixed. All in all, I would never drive anything else. I love my KIA. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the Kia Optima 1 year ago- this is my 3rd Kia. I received a Happy Birthday card from the dealer about a week before the shifter cable disengaged and nearly caused me to crash into a car while trying to park. The dealership examined the cable and said that they had never seen anything like it-nothing was broken or damaged, the cable just came off. Now, almost a month later, I am riding shotgun in my husband's truck as the cable once again has "disengaged". I seriously think there is a design flaw in this model and I am just glad I have never tried to used the manual shift feature-- imagine having the cable "disengaging" at 75 miles an hour on the interstate!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had an attitude about getting my Kia at first. I had a Hyundai and didn't want another car like that. I had to get it because of my job, I am in sales and drive a lot and needed something reliable. NOW! All I ever want is a KIA. They are stylish and sleek. IT drives like a caddy and I love the car, has never left me stranded and I am not so good about changing the oil and they are made to be able to go 10,000 max if you forget to change the oil like me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Kia Optima in the shop 3 times for AC problems. The ac shuts on and off by itself when brake applied or idling. The first time, they couldn't find a problem. Second time said it was a (fuel cell) in ac. Third time they replaced the compressor. I kept telling them it was a idling problem and they fixed something else. It still shuts off at stop lights and when I am stuck in traffic. Not good living in the South!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The basic car is great but the fuel mileage is less than advertised. With a 34 hwy mpg on the sticker we figured we would average over 30 but we are between 26 and 28 mpg. That has really disappointed us. KIA does not seem concerned saying it is better than the 24 city mpg. We drive 95% highway on cruise control on 70 MPH with not much slowing or stopping. Also the radio does not pick up AM very well. </TEXT>

Since September I have the weather stripping on my windshield come off, I have had a bad tire, and the gear shifter cable undone twice leaving me stuck because my car was stuck in reverse, I have had it towed to the dealership twice within a month.

<TEXT>I have had this car for a month already. I really like it but I have had to replace the trunk seal because it leaked when you ran it through the car wash and I had to have a fuel pump and sender replaced. The sender doesn't come separately so you have to get the whole pump. The car had around 28,000 miles on it when I bought it. I was a little disappointed that a major part had to be replaced already. free under warranty but I am a little worried about down the road repairs. I hope it is better than the ford contour I had before that thing was always being repaired. I did do some research and found the type of engine inside the car is suppose to be good for 250,000 miles. I hope it lasts.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the blue dashboard lights!! I like the style of the car&inside. I like the fold down seats. I love the attached hubcaps I was always losing them on the other car.

<TEXT>First I have to say that it saddens me horribly to write a poor review for this car. It was such an amazing car for the longest time. My commute is 148 miles everyday and my Optima handled the long daily drive like a champ until this last month. At 63,373 miles the engine failed. It seized just cruising down the highway and nearly caused me to crash into the center divider. After a nice little dance with Kia, they agreed to replace it. At 65,973, the transmission had to be replaced. Finally a Kia mechanic told me that the 07 models have some severe quality issues. He said that owners who do heavy driving, and have long commutes have had head gasket, engine and transmission problems.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Car was amazingly comfortable on long drives. Great handling, cruise control, a seemingly perfect car until things started to roll down hill. I sold the car to carmax and informed them of my problems. They didn't seem to care and they were happy the car had a new engine and transmission.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Car ran perfectly fine for the first 42,000 miles and then everything went downhill. Head gasket blew, then the automatic transmission went crazy on me & blew, cruise control went out, car has died three times on the highway and left me stranded. I babied the heck out of the car. Mobil 1 full synthetic oil every three thousand miles, new transmission fluid, all scheduled maintenance, everything. The car really seemed to be perfect until it hit the 42,000 mile mark I sold the car last month and the new owner has informed me that the car has had numerous insanely costly problems. I warned him before he bought the car but he fell in love with the style and he said he read some great reviews.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage was good, I averaged 28 highway, and 19 city. The Kia warranty saved me about $7,500 in repairs I would of had to pay. The dealership says that they are having a ton of problems with this car once it reaches the 50,000 mile mark. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>4 door sedan</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Just bought this car new a week ago. Not many miles driven yet but so far the car has met/exceeded expectations. It's quiet in town and on the highway, even at 70/80 mph with only minor wind noise from the outside mirrors, a big improvement over my last car. Transmission is very smooth and the powertrain combination gives excellent performance on hills. Ride is comfortable but the driver seat needs an extra inch or two of seat cushion to give better thigh support for longer trips. I looked at the Civic and Nissan Sentra and Versa but dollar for dollar, the Optima was a no brainer, lot's of bang for the buck. I'll give another rating after I put more miles on the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a 40 years old male 6 ft 200 lbs. that drives 55 miles each way to work daily in western NY. Historically a V6 sedan man but the 4 cyl engine is more than adequate especially with the timing chain vs belt. The miles that I put on that the chain saves a $400 preventative maintenance every 2 years (60,000 K). Suspension and ride is good and headlights at night as well. Taller ground clearance 6.3 inches will help in the winter. I have only 1200 miles on it so the MPG is low 27 the first tank and 29 the second. After break in I expect 34-35. With the long warranty, big time incentives and KIA having a few ears under their belt, it is the best valued import if you are buying. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Warranty. Timing chain on the 4 cyl (not the V6). blue interior lighting (steering wheel controls and power controls are illuminated). Michelin OEM tires on EX.

<TEXT>We did a great deal of research before purchasing the Optima and it was the right decision. We have the fully loaded EX with the appearance package and I highly recommend it. We went with the 4 cyl for the better mileage and after 5,000 miles we are seeing MPG returns in line with what was stated on the ticker. Great car for cruising on the highway because it is comfortable and quiet. We had a bad snow/ice storm here in CT and the traction control was outstanding. I never lost control for a moment and felt like I was driving an AWD car rather than FWD.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased a 2007 Kia Optima EX V6 with heated seats, sunroof, spoilers, dual exhaust, etc. and LOVE this car! It has lots of safety features, a huge trunk, a comfortable interior, and is still sporty to drive. It feels like you are riding in a much more expensive car. The car is very responsive. We have owned sports cars and luxury cars, but this is the best of both worlds. The front and rear de-icers are great and the ten speaker Infinity sound system is AWESOME! The built-in roll-down shade for the rear is like those often seen on a Benz. The car is quality built and we believe that by the time Honda and Toyota take note, their market share may be lost! We love both our Kias.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I thoroughly researched my next car. Have owned Hondas and Toyotas the past 20 years. Purchased a 2006.5 (07) Optima after reading about the redesigned engine, interior, exterior and suspension. Kia has put together a solid product, very ergonomic - everything fits well, easy to use, just plain feels great to drive, similar to the Japanese cars with a few thousand to pocket. It's the culmination of the little things that adds to the confidence in the car - the way the door shuts, outlet in trunk, cabin lighting, hand-holds, etc. Kia makes the leap easy, with transferable 5yr, 60k warranty, roadside assistance, etc.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at every car out there. I liked the Optima right away. After I first drove it, I knew it was the car I wanted. I am very picky with my cars, and have a couple of styling gripes (why is the roofline so much higher in front than in back!?) but overall it's an unassuming car I don't have to be embarassed to be seen in. Fit and finish are superb. The only thing that feels cheap are the interior door handles. The car is unbelievably quiet, which makes it a pleasure for leisurely driving. Mileage had proven to be amazing for such a large car. On that note, it is VERY roomy and for thousands less than a Civic LX I just feel like I got more car for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have rated this car before (see mickeyrom), but since I have put a few thousand miles on it, it has really grown on me. All the bugs are now out of it and I have finally found a dealer who has a great service dept., so I am glad I bought this car. MPG in city remains poor, but in every other way it has met or exceeded my expectations. Once I figured out how to use the steering column adjustments, I easily and comfortably fit my 6 ft frame into the seat. It actually has more driver space than my 97 Town and Country. I would strongly recommend this brand and this model to friends.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I initially thought Kia was a cheap knock off. Then my sister bought one and I drove it and was impressed. I went to the dealer wanting to buy a Spectra but found that the Optima cost not much more, but had so much more to give. I am very impressed with this vehicle. The quality of it is wonderful, I love the interior design, and the ride and quietness of this vehicle is everything you would expect in a luxury car. I am one who likes the manual trans and found one with the four cylinder. All the reviews I've read give the car poor performance on the highway, but I think it's got more power than it needs on the highway. I would recommend this car to my best friend.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have previously owned a Kia Spectra. It was nice, but 2 years later, I went back to the dealership, and fell in love with the Optima. Totally surprised with the power for a four cylinder! I can hold up the parking brake, and burn out (I know, not the smartest thing to do but it does it well)! I have every option available, except for the V6, but I don't need the V6 the 4 cyl is plenty. I feel like I am driving a Lexus or Mercedes. The ride is unmatched.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for about 5 months and have almost 10000 miles on it. I am a big guy and I found the room and comfort to be very surprising. I chose the 4 cyl. over the 6 because I found it to be more sporty and responsive than the 6 which seemed a little laggy to me. The interior styling and the heavy resemblance to the Lexus at well under half the price is a big plus. If this car performs over the long run as I expect I will definetly be a longtime Kia customer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven quite a few autos and I love my Optima. The dealer came to pick me up in the 2007 and I fell in love with the car. Then they wheeled out the 2007 with the appearance package. Love at first sight. 17 inch rims and low pro tires. Chrome interior. Blue light dashboard. I have had people coming up to my car and looking at the Kia symbol like whoa?!?! A Kia??? Yes ladies and gentleman- A KIA!! Handles like a dream and the sport-stick performs like a dream. The take off power and acceleration has me moving at a pace that is keeping up with the best. I'm telling you, This car is a real shocker!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The chrome interior and the 17 inch rims and tire package. I also love the swift handling. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall I have had no problems with my Optima and have gotten many compliments on it. I'm still not sure it's the car for me, but it has performed well. The gas mileage in town isn't very exciting but the car rides so smooth and handles very well. Can't beat the fact it came with some free oil changes and a great warranty either. Overall I'm pleased with the look of the car, inside and out, and the performance of the car. There are several little things that really annoy me however. 10 in reliability because that remains to be seen.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the look of the car and the cloth used for the seats is nice. The styling inside and outside looks more expensive that what it was.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I compared Honda, Toyota, Ford, Saturn, Pontiac and was surprised to find that the Optima beat out the others. The deciding factor was the standard safety features and room. I am 6'4" and found that most of the others wouldn't accommodate my knees. The backseat is great and there is more than enough room all around. I have owned the car only a short while but have been very impressed with the overall common-sense design. The ride is very good. It is a midsize sedan, not a sports car. The standard 2.4 is plenty for me especially with the ability to down/up shift. I did the comparison, crunched the numbers and for the money you just cant beat it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2500 miles. Averaging 23 MPG in town. Just got 33 MPG on its first long interstate trip while running in the low to mid 70s. Car is comfortable and quiet. Not a sports car, but, it is very competent with about 5 PSI extra in the tires. Transmission and engine seem to be well matched and smooth. On the interstate, even in full auto mode it does not down shift at every hill. In the manumatic mode you can make it hold 5th even longer to increase mileage. Acceleration will easily keep up with any reasonable traffic without flogging it. Like the chain drive camshafts that do not require replacement belts every 70K. No problems yet ? car has not even been back to the dealer. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks and drives like a 2004 Lexus ES 300. Costs a lot less. Good room. Lots of standard equipment. Chain (not belt) driven cams save replacement costs. Gas mileage. Warranty will keep me out from under the hood for a long time.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I own a 2006.5 EX fully loaded Optima with 1400 miles on the odometer.The vehicle meets all my expectations for quality, and comfort except for one glaring problem. When traveling over a rough road, I feel like I'm inside a loud drum. The front end noise is pronounced and, unfortunately, that condition is unacceptable to me. My query to a Kia phone representative was met with an unresponsive answer. I believe a sound deadening application of some sort, would alleviate the condition. Then and only then would I consider the car on a par or even superior to the competition.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car after about 9 months of searching. It seems to have everything I need without a lot of extras I don't care about. Interior room is great and the layout works well. Handling is very good, I don't regret not buying a "performance car". People that see it for the first time always have the same reaction, "That's a Kia?" They comment on its good looks and great use of space.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the LX AT version with the Appearance package. I've had it for 3 and a half months at the time of this writing, and I am convinced that I made the right choice when purchasing this vehicle. I owned a Kia before this and had a couple of problems that needed warranty work, and the fit and finish were not that great. This has not been the case with this vehicle. I have yet to have any issues and no matter how much I've inspected it, I haven't identified any fit and finish defects, and the material seems high quality. The interior with the appearance package is just plain beautiful, worthy of a $30,000 vehicle, and I paid about half that after rebates; WAY LESS than an equivalent Accord.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>You get quite a few goodies for less than $1,000 when opting for the appearance package, and just the upgraded Michelin tires are worth about $800, so it seems like a no-brainer to me. I also like the sound of the engine when accelerating, it sounds like a jet-engine, rather than a rough rumble.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>4 cylinder EX with leather, handling package and sunroof. In other words, loaded. Only complaints I have are a bit of a stiff ride and issues with passenger side airbags.

<TEXT>Build quality inside and out is first rate. Has good pickup and ride is quiet. Looks like a much more expensive car than it is. A great value and fully loaded with extras you would pay extra for in other cars. Tight responsive steering and good road feel...very European ride (which means you're not floating over bumps).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Researched, thoroughly. Physically checked out every other competitor. Hands down, this is the best deal out there for a mid-sized sedan. This feels more luxurious and sporty than you'd expect. It's so nice you almost want to take your shoes off when you get into it. People who sit in the front and the back comment about the remarkable comfort, quietness, and luxurious feel. Strangers stare, daytime or night. People who drive Accords and Camrys marvel over its looks inside and out. My teenagers think it's one of the best looking vehicles around. Recently ran into black ice. The car took over and stopped me smoothly much like normal - save the feel of the anti-lock brakes. It's sure-footed!</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far, a great ownership experience. Quiet ride. Gas mileage is improving, I am up to 21mpg in city driving 4-cylinder. Kia's road hazard tire policy already saved me over $246 when I picked up a sidewall nail. ESC package is very handy to have on rainy mountain roads and CA freeways. Sunroof wind noise is very low up to about 50mph. I feel confident while driving this car. Front styling shows character. Rear styling is "nondescript" midsize. You can park this car anywhere. Most people are very surprised once they get inside.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior room is very nice. Smooth shifting A/T can play with the gears when you want or need to or just leave it alone for regular driving. Gauges and backlighting are informative without being a lightshow. I like the gear indicator.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm totally impressed with the 07 Optima! I was only considering the Accord or Camry, but the Optima won me over. It performs just as nicely, and in my opinion has a much nicer interior than the others. The build quality and style are impressive as well, not to mention the 5 star safety rating for all four tests, including the notoriously difficult offset frontal crash test.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I probably would have rated this car much higher if the passenger seat air bags worked properly. My only complaints besides that are the following. 1. No MPG on trip computer 2. Very hard ride. Pretty hard to seriously rate reliability after only one month, but I will be making my third trip to the dealer next week. Judge accordingly.</TEXT>
