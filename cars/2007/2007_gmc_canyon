<TEXT>Long story short, 4cyl short bed 2wd automatic. 6500 miles and regardless of ethanol blend or 100% fuel AND smooth acceleration AND following speed limits, 15mpg. Yes, 15 mpg and 17 highway. that is completely pathetic. My 110,000mi 4x4 4.0 liter cherokee did better. Why compromise with a 4cyl and get worse mileage than my friends 4x4 3/4 ton 6.0 liter with 4.10 axle ratio. Upon taking in for service, service advisor reports that everything is as it should be and that is just what mileage they get. Needless to say, that is completely pathetic. I and my family have ALWAYS owned GM vehicles. I guarantee this will be my last. I have never been this let down with a vehicle out of the 60+ ive had</TEXT>

<TEXT>Truck lacks in the power department, especially after putting any larger wheel/tires on. I added exhaust, high performance plugs, throttle body spacer, and knn air filter which all helped quite a bit. Exterior design is fabulous great looking truck. The auto locker in the rear is a great thing to have has saved me a lot especially being 2w. Interior with the vinyl floor is nice and easy to keep clean no carpet to worry about staining. Seats are uncomfortable @ best. Handles very well around corners. Manual version has low towing capacity.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior design, auto locker in the rear, vinyl floor, and great drivability. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Good truck but very basic. Drive daily commute to work of 60 miles round-trip. Comfort is minimal compared to Ford Sport-Trac. Wide stance gives stable ride but very noisy inside. Needs better sound- proofing and door gaskets. Hard to see ignition key due to big steering wheel center. Hard to find and connect to the power outlets beneath the dash. Needs interior storage behind seats and read seat headrests block vision out back window. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Solid ride and good ground clearance. Tough truck with bed liner. Stable truck even in turns and high winds. Price compared to Toyota. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Always owned Toyota's bought this because it was cheap, and had a lot of power out of the 4 cylinder. Motor is weak, unless heavily gouged. A lot of cheap features inside, check engine light comes on all the time, cheap plastic bumper cracked and fell off. Seat in uncomfortable at best. Lot of cab room but the cheap interior kinds of kills that</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Big cab, nice looking</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my SLE Crewcab, 5 cyl., auto, 4x4 last August, worked it hard this past record snowfall winter. The 4wd and locking rearend made it unstoppable. The truck listed at $25.6K, after rebates, dealing, and GM points, paid $18.5K before tax. This was about $10K less than Toyota or Nissan. I do mainly city driving, short trips, only 3-4K miles/year, so mpg is not a great concern. I am not surprised that it wasn't hitting the epa ratings considering the few miles on the truck, short trips, cold weather, and use of 4wd.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good power, slick 4x4 system, locking rear end, well laid out interior, compact size, smooth and quiet on the highway.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Yeah, I'll admit I wanted a Tacoma xtra-cab, but, I bought an American truck with more features, and at a better price. Yes, the fit and finish is not the same as Toyota, but it is close. My only complaint is freeway wind rush coming from the drivers side 1/2 door (which isnt much). If you have the sunroof (which I think is pretty cool, no one else has it...) you need a wind deflector. Yes, the interior is simple, but I didnt think it was cheap looking. The factory 6 disc player cranks pretty good too. The 2.9l! is the best 4 cyl I ever sat behind, and it gets damn decent mileage. $8000 less than a Tacoma! I have enough left over to buy a new Titus Mtn. Bike...</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Strong 4 cyl., available sunroof, great plush ride (off-road suspension), very quiet interior. The MT is smooooth. Respectable mileage. The exterior design is very pleasing. 70 mph @ 2000 rpm.....No real blind spots. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My truck is a SLE Ext. Cab 3.7 5 cyl. Automatic Trans. The web site does not give this choice. I drove a Nissan Frontier for 2 months and there is no reason to get the Nissan. This truck is quiet and has a much better ride. Fuel milage is better by 3 MPG, city. Engine is smooth and refined. I have loaded the bed with mulch and dirt and the ride was good and there was plenty of power. The seats in the back are only for children. This truck has side air bags which are not found in other trucks this size. I also mounted a BOSS snowplow to this and it plows like a full size. The locking rear end is also excellent and not found on any other truck this size. The truck is a tank in snow and mud. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Canyon and I love it. It has great towing capability and I get a lot of standard features on a base model like remote keyless entry, cruise control, and intermittent wipers. I also opted for XM satellite radio. This is great, because Toyota makes you pay extra on the Tacoma for keyless entry and cruise control. Canyon even gives me a leather wrapped steering. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good fuel economy. Great ride</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I would absolutely recommend the Canyon. Great horsepower and towing capacity for a smaller truck. Quiet ride and excellent quality from the Profressional Grade Division of General Motors. Makes the Tacoma look silly.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, 2 position tailgate, quietness, nice interior</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall an excellent vehicle. Very fun to drive. I expected a little bit better gas mileage given the 5 cyl. only getting 19 MPG, same as my full size truck got! interior comfortable front seat, wish the passager side seat had the lumbar support like the driver. The interior could have used some courtesy lighting for at night, can't find anything in the dark without having to turn on the dome light. Given the size of the competitors small trucks GM could have given the crew cab a longer bed than the 5 feet. I wish the rear seats had just a little more angle to the backs of the seats just a few degrees too vertical. Overall nice quiet ride. i would reccomend to others</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth quiet ride, fun to drive. Nice style on the exterior. No rattles or squeeks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Nice quiet ride, smooth shifting automatic. The good ends there. Unless you opt for the $500 power package available on upscale or special order vehicles, there is no way to unlock the passenger door from the outside. Unsafe and inconvenient. The front has 4 cup holders, but none hold a 1 liter water bottle or adjust. In the extended cab, the rear seat cup holders do hold a 1 liter water bottle. With standard upholstery the seatbacks do not recline. Seems GM could have made the tilt-forward access handle on the seatback recline as well. Unless you get an upscale model I would think before buying this vehicle due to the inconvenience factor. </TEXT>
