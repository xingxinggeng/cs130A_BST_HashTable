<TEXT>I purchased one of the earliest Acadias (April 2007)--the top of the line version with all the features--AWD, etc. Truck was great for about 8 months, and then I had one of the software updates applied, and it changed something about the transmission in a significant way. I could tell immediately upon picking up the vehicle. Car can't find right gear to be in, sluggish up the slightest hills, poor gas mileage (13mpg max), poor acceleration, wheezing. Well, 2 weeks and 3 days ago, at 37,800 miles-- THE END. Tranmission crapped out with my whole family in the car. Guess what? No Acadia transmissions available at all because GM's suppliers have cut back production. Who knows how long I'll wait?</TEXT>

<TEXT>We had 3 engine failures in about a year?s period of time. For no apparent reason the engine would just stop. It didn't matter if we were in traffic, on a major highway or making a turn. When the engine quits you no longer have brakes or steering that the average person could use. We ask GMC to get us into another Acadia since our lives were being put at risk in this car but all they did was offer to extend our OnStar. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have some serious quality concerns regarding the reliability of my Acadia as it accumulates miles. First, the odometer failed and just got it back from the dealer...had to replace the transmission after 25k miles. Plan on trading it in for a more reliable brand/model.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased the car in 2007 and noticed the acceleration was poor especially when A/C is on. Hit 36,000 miles memorial day weekend and since then the waterpump, and transmission sensor have been replace. Now car is whining and was told in normal cars they have power steering but this car doesn't and it is electrical and you not what that means more money. Overall this is not a reliable vehicle. Service department now knows my name but they are good at making the repairs.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Acadia for over 2 years now and I still really love to drive it. Gets good gas mileage for me ~20 combined, stereo is amazing, tons of room and plenty of power for getting around town. The only thing I will say is that even though I am meticulous about maintaining it, it is starting to develop some creaks and rattles and the dealer cant seem to be able to fix them. Nothing major but still slightly annoying for a $38K car. I have heard about problems with sunroofs and radios but luckily I hate sunroofs so I don't have one and my radio works great. Also for everyone that complains of it shifting alot, who cares? Its not like it noticeable since its so smooth.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased used w-15204 miles Aug.2008. Really enjoy taking a road trip in it. extremely comfortable, quiet w-great visibility, optioned out. Even has a console cup holder night light. Vehicle has had a constant front end problem-pulling to the right. Front end has been re-alinged twice and today dealer advises 2 front tire eaten up, 1 down to the core on inside edge (hidden)! Still at dealer attempting to find out what the problem is for 2 days. Mileage is not good even though recall and service bulletin issues have supposedly been fixed. Gets a little better after being serviced but goes back to bad days later. We love the car, but wish these two issues could be fixed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased the Acadia in Feb 2007, and 2 1/2 years later, the transmission failed! The dealership admitted to a bulletin being issued about the transmission. We had a recall repaired with the transmission like most a few years ago but it is now completely shot. Thank God for the extended warranty because GMC is not willing to repair or replace this defective transmission in my two year old car. I am disappointed to say the least. The radio is defective as well, they have replaced it twice. I loved this car even though it was in and out of the shop for recalls but this is a lemon.I will be speaking to attorney.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had this vehicle for 3 years and love it for soccer mom duty and ever family trip. The gas mileage posted on our window was 28mpg highway. Which is not even close. I was say 22 at best and we have the front wheel drive only version. We average 16mpg. The stated towing is 6000lbs. We tried towing a 5000lbs trailer once, this vehicle could not do it. I will never tow with it again. The transmission is a little shifty also but this was improved with an updated last year. We do love it, and it is one of the best vehicles we have ever owned though.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Love My Acadia!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have been driving my 2007 Acadia for 2 full years, and I still love it. I commute 30 miles one way, and spend a lot of time in the vehicle on trips. The comfort and features make it a joy to drive! I had it in the shop only one time before warranty expired for very minor issues and one recall, and it has not needed any other repairs. I get 18+MPG in town, 24+MPG on the highway - very close to what is promised. I prviously drove a 98 Oldsmobile minivan, and a 2003 Chevy Tahoe. This Acadia has as much room as the minivan, but is much more stylish and comfortable, and it is much more roomy and functional than the Tahoe. Highly recommend to families with small children or teenagers!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased approximately two weeks ago, so far not disappointed at all. Interior design is excellent but I have also noticed the glare on the A/C vents mentioned in other reviews but not a serious issue for me. The motor and transmission are extremely smooth and I don't have any problems with the six speed, it wants to get into 5-6 gears as quick as possible but a slight tap on the accelerator down shifts it quickly. Mileage overall is aveaging about 18.5 mpg in a blend of 50% city/highway. A 100 mile interstate trip did deliver 22 and I averaged 75 mph. You can't do that in my '03 Tahoe which I traded.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Grandkids love the DVD, I love the White Diamond and Brick color combo. I really like the way it handles, good steering feel and the suspension is tight enough that it doesn't float on the shocks, good road feel but rides great and very, very quiet inside</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Acadia is basically a good-looking, well performing, comfortable, reliable, stylish, fun to drive minivan, thats actually a crossover. Comfortable, back rows are surprisingly big, enough for an adult to sit comfortable for a 5-hour trip. It has been problem free, craftmanship: A+. So sharp looking, along with the brick red leather interior: A+. Fuel economy, great. The HID headlights, LED taillights, just make it seem like it is a good looking minivan (that's actually a crossover, so it performs like a car) made by a luxury brand. A+.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Previous to this purchase, the last GM car I owned was 1963 Corvair given to me by my father. Since then, I have owned a Honda Prelude, a Madza RX-7, an Infiniti G20, and a Jeep Grand Cherokee (a very good SUV). This GMC Acadia is the best road vehicle I have ever owned and proves that Detroit is back on the block. Now, I need GMC to create a sports car for my short city drives, although I might consider the Pontiac or Sky. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my 2007 Acadia 7-7-07, I am very pleased with this car. I read many reviews and took 2 months to decide on a car that would suit my family of 6. Children ages 4,5,10,12. This car is fun to drive, we get lots of stares and compliments from strangers. The kids really enjoy the DVD player, and the Sky Scape, I like the sunroof, and the auto headlights. It's super comfy to ride in. I got the 7 seating with 4 captains chairs so it would be easier for the kids to climb into the back, although you can slide the seats back and down, they usually get to the car before me and I didnt want to have a 3 rows of seats all muckied up by their footprints so this was better for us.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sunroof, Skyscape, XM radio, DVD player, leather seats, power tailgate, remote start, automatic headlights. Allover look and feel of the car. Panel lights at night are RED, very cool, almost looks like a airplane cockpit! 10 Bose speakers. Wireless headphones for the DVD player. Power outlet.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fun to drive vehicle. Convenience of a very large SUV packaged with the drive handling, accesories, amenities & styling of a premium luxury sedan. We were set on buying a competitor (and imported) SUV vehicle, but the Acadia had everything we wanted and more for the price. Safety was a key point. Good gas mileage for an AWD optioned car, too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was very impressed with the drive and style of my new Acadia. I feel that the transmission would run more efficiant had it been larger. Sometime the transmission dosen"t know what to do. I took it for a 15 hr one way road trip to Tampa, Florida and it drove great other than giving me the advertised fuel mileage. Overall I get many looks of impressed people when I drive it. GMC has to be commended for a job well done, makes you want to keep buying American.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have not purchased a new domestic vehicle since my 1974 Camaro SS. The Acadia is the first vehicle since that attracted me enough to make the switch. While the MPG isn't quite where I hoped it would be, I am averaging around 20 mpg with a combo of heavy freeway stop and go traffic. On a recent road trip to Arizona, I averaged about 24mpg, which I was quite satisfied with. I am very happy with this vehicle. For a versatile, all around utility vehicle with style and comfort, I don't think that you can beat it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just took a 1,000 mile trip and was miserable. I kept hitting my head on the tilted head of the seat and had a crick in my neck my entire trip. The seats are so firm they feel hard. The lumbar support feels like it never releases and both drivers on my trip had backaches. The only positive was the front window has good visibility in the rain. I am sorry I bought this car since I travel frequently. The FM radio has poor reception so you must pay for XM. The car is slow and the gas pedal is hard to push and you must lift your foot at a severe angle to reach. I can't believe I read so many good reviews. This car is slow, eats gas, and is just plain uncomfortable!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Acadia has a few strong selling points: -Quiet ride. As good as most luxury cars. -Space galore. Easy access to third row, easy to fold seats down. Just plain roomy. -Comfortable seating. Long periods in the car are pleasant. -Sound system is decent, with mp3 input on the dash. -Great looking vehicle! However, there are some kinks. -Transmission is sluggish. -Chrome interior trim reflects light into your eyes. -Height of rear window is hard for my wife to see out. -There needs to be open storage in the console, for pens, change, etc. Cup holders get used for this, and then you have no cup holders left.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Congratulations GMC, this car blows away the competition. The styling is excellent and unlike others complaints I see about inital gas mileage, I am averaging 20mpg in heavy Chicago area traffic where my average speed is about 17mph with many starts and stops. I am sure I could make it average a lot less like some of the complaints here, if I really tried by accelerating hard. This is a great alternative to gas guzzling large SUV's or mini-vans. The ride and quiet interior are better than the Acura we own or the Volvo we used to own. Best in class legroom for all three rows of seating without sacrificing cargo space.</TEXT>

I loved my Honda Odyssey but I was ready to not have a "Mommy Mobile" and this fits the bill. I still have room to cart around my children's friends without having to drive a van. I have never purchased American but so far so good. I was also deciding between Mazda CX-9 and Acadia and after talking to my mechanic he pushed me to the GMC.

The ride is smooth, although after 3 months rattles with the doors and undercarrage have started to appear, a few features like the rear wiper switch being on the highbeam switch which easily gets turned on by mistake when switching the highbeams. and chrome accents that reflect the sun in your eyes. But for the little amount of snow I drove it in the handling and traction was great, Don't let anyone lean on your Acadia as the panels dent easy. For a GM vehicle it was better than expected, but still not great. </TEXT>

<TEXT>An outstanding presentation by GM! The fit and finish of the Acadia brings GMC to the level of the Asian or Europeans. Attention to detail and the overall driving experience has been outstanding. The capability and size of the Acadia is masked by outstanding agility, fabulous ride, and wonderful driving experience. The second and third row seating ae designed in a manner which is well thought out. Clearly the third row was not an add on as it is in many smaller cross overs. Adjustable seating in the second row is a sign that GM took the overall needs for 7 passengers seriously. Excellent storage space, ergonomics, and overall design.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Wide stance and wheelbase support an excellent ride. Handling is excellent. Heads up display is an valuable aid for the driver. The fit and finish is outstanding and substantially eliminates any road noise.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have never owned an American vehicle, but really liked the looks of the Acadia. Incredibly, the other vehicle I was considering was the Mercedes C class. After 7,000 miles/4 months, I still have not heard one squeak or rattle, and the car drives possibly better than my original test drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Took delivery a couple of weeks ago. We chose the Acadia over the Mazda CX9 because of the additional interior room and ease of access to the third row. So far we are very happy with the overall purchase except for the terrible gas mileage when compared to what is stated on the sticker. The first tank of gas which was a combined city and highway was 15 mpg. The second and third tanks were 100% city driving in Houston, Texas and we are getting 12 mpg; a huge dissapointment because we get this same 12 mpg with our Yukon XL and Ford Expedition; both of which are V8s. Hopefully this will improve.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior look turns heads. It does not look like a GMC. The DVD rear entertainment and dual sunroofs are a big hit with our kids. Very easy to get in/out of even for a six footer. 19 inch wheels look much better than the standard 18's.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was very concerned buying a new GM vehicle after owning a Honda Pilot for the last 4 yrs, and picked this over the new MDX. This vehicle is much quieter on the hiway, is larger inside, more HP, and same gas mileage as the Pilot. Love the dark carpets even with the taupe leather, very comfy seats and hidden receiver hitch, chrome door handles. Wish I could've purchased front moonroof only. Tranny can't decide which gear to pick on hills at hiway speed, nature of the 6 speed beast. Highly recommend backup sensors due to small tailgate window.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling looks great, as does interior! Huge interior simular to minivan, sliding captain's chairs offer lots of leg room, console storage, head rests that you can actually rest your head on. Effortless steering and feel for such a large vehicle.</FAVORITE>

My wife wasn't sure at first, but after driving it and seeing the Acadia in white she loved it. We ordered one which took 6 weeks but was worth the wait. What a class vehicle. Before buying an import do yourself a favor and check this one out. The only thing we left off was heads up and nav system. I will use a portable nav.

<TEXT>This is a great vehicle. The ride is smooth as befits a large car. It is responsive, and it is very comfortable in all three rows of seats. Although there are a lot of controls, they are well laid out and intuitive to use. For a large vehicle, it is quite maneuverable and fairly easy to park. The power rear lift gate is surprisingly handy. While gas mileage isn't great, it is pretty good for such a large vehicle. Bottom line: I don't especially enjoy driving, but I actually look forward to driving my new Acadia.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this after comparing a Tahoe, Pilot, Edge, Sequoaya, Highlander, Outlander, CX-9, and Explorer. I can't be happier with my decision after several months. I got the brick interior, heads up display, and huge sunroof; it catches everyones eye. The captain's chairs are nice and the third row seats are much more spacious than other full size SUVs. The fit and finish of the interior is finally on par with European vehicles. Forget the comments about the plastic, it is fine. The tranny downshifts sluggishly but that is to save gas. I average 20.5MPG with city/congestion driving. There are some comments about rust on the exhuast, this is the stainless steel discoloring</TEXT>

We sold our reliable, conservative Honda Odyssey for a bit of luxury in the fully loaded (minus Nav) SLT2 - Carbon Metallic with Ebony leather interior.

Most of the features of a minivan without the ridicule from your friends and family. Hard to put a price tag on that! We researched and looked at nearly every third-row SUV and kind of stumbled upon the Acadia and were pleased to find that it had all of the features that we valued. Roomy, enough trunk space with the third row up, easy-in and easy-out with the captain's chairs, and better mileage than the very large SUV's. Overall, we've been very happy with the Acadia.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Leased the vehicle thinking I would get close to the the MPG listed as I mostly drive at highway speeds and few if any stops. Best MPG I have gotten so far is 16.4 but avg only 14.7 weekly. I was told this engine would break in and I would get better MPG but after 1200 miles I doubt this will come up that much to match the sticker claims. I love this car as it meets every other need I have but to suffer at the pumps is getting the best of me. I also have a problem with the transmission not always being in the proper gear on grades. This could be a major factor in the low MPG. I recommend GM look into this further. I grow more angry at every fill-up </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a remarkable vehicle with almost every feature a luxury vehicle should have. I traded in my Infiniti QX4 so I had high expectations from the beginning. I?m used to a bit more luxury with leather surrounds on the doors and dash but have tried overlooking this in favor of the 7 passenger seating, which is very practical with the grandkids. It?s one of the easiest vehicles to get passengers into the third row seat and I?m guessing that other manufactures will follow suit soon. It?s also the quietest vehicle I?ve driven in years. It?s so quiet that you can?t hear the engine shifting gears unless you mash the accelerator. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We were impressed with all the supposedly included features until we actually bought the car and found out many of them do not function in all the models. ie the drivers information center on the base models. We felt the features could be changed to meet our needs. After having the car/truck for a week we have found out that while they are there and functioning they only function the way the engineers at GMC choose to make them function. In particular is the door locks. They lock as expected when you put the car into gear. The problem is they unlock automatically when ever you put the Acadia into park. ie, waitng at a train crossing in the worse part of town.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Acadia after a long comparison period. I looked at Toyota, Nissan and Dodge. I picked the Acadia primarily on the gas mileage and the look of the vehicle. I am happy with the drive, however the transmission tends to lag on a quick acceleration. The internal comfort is excellent. My only negative comment is there is a "hum" that is audible when driving slow or at a stop light. Since I listen to talk radio it is easily heard in the gaps. I took it back into the dealer and they said the noise is comparable to the Acacda they had on the lot. It may be nit-picking, but the ride is so smooth and quiet its disappointing to listen to a hum.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned the vehicle for only 3 days. This is the first US brand I have ever purchased - said many times before that I would never buy US, but GM built the perfect vehicle for my family... 2 children under 3yrs, wife did not want a minivan, no real need for a huge SUV, but wanted something big to haul everything to grandma's house. Acceleration is good. Responsive steering and tight turning radius makes it drive like a smaller car. Suspension makes for comforatble cruising. Little body roll when cornering at speed. Interior fit and finish is excellent - no squeaks or rattles. Very little wind noise at highway speeds. Have yet to find anything inside not thoughtfully designed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall design - meets every need my family has for a minivan; fits my and my wife's need not to drive a minivan; looks solid like a truck; drives like a car.

Got every feature possible except the heads up display which I thought might just annoy me to be honest. Driving around in town the on board computer calculates mpg at around 18-20 so far and they are usually pretty accurate. Didn't hurt any that I bought it on the GM plan for retired GM employees - thanks grandad - and saved a bundle. Handles great, looks awesome, comfortable, a real head turner so far.

<TEXT>I researched everything out there, and landed on the Acadia. I needed a good family car with a towing capacity of not less than 4500 lbs. That shortened the list to the MDX and the Mercedes, and other GM Lambda platform cars. I purchased a loaded SLT2, and it seems great. Build quality is excellent. It handles extremely well. I believe GM hit a grand slam here. If build quality holds up, this car will compare very well against the MDX and others. And, the six speed tranny should give me an efficiency edge over all non GM competitors (until they adopt similar high efficiency transmissions).</TEXT>

<TEXT>Saw the Acadia at a car show first. Was and still impressed with comfort features and looks of this car. Will be a great car to take on vacations and other trips. I have not really tested the performance of car due to the fact it is not fully broken in. With the 275 hp I am sure it will have plenty power. I am very disappointed in the gas mileage that the car gets. 16.2 is the best I've recorded and that's 95% hwy driving and driving at 65 mph nowhere near the window sticker estimate of 17 city and 24 hwy. Any answers GM? I have a feeling the mpg won't improve much even after 10K miles. Compared to my Murano I traded the room is much better but I miss the fuel economy of the Murano. Overall GM did a great job on this crossover I would recommend it to friends.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle has it all. Comfort, performance, fuel economy, workmanship and styling. The 2nd row bench seat (which I elected to have vs the standard Captains chairs), has unbelievable leg room and can be reclined slightly to give even more room. The 3rd row seats fold flat and are easy to manually operate. The vehicle feels solid under you and entry and exit is easy.so forget about running boards. MPG has averaged what GMC advertised, and with this vehicle having 270 hp I find it remarkable. Performance is always there. On the highway, the vehicle is quiet and interior craftsmanship is excellent. I find myself looking for excuses so I can go drive the vehicle. GMC has a winner. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I always want a car with style of Lexus, drive like a Infiniti, capacity like a Tahoe, price tag like a Chevy and fuel efficient like a Toyota and Acadia is the closest I can get. Got my Acadia on Feb 17, my whole family just can't have enough of it. Totally in love with the style, size and power. Oh yes, don't under estimate this 3.6L V6 engine. Lot of buttons is true but they are all well placed. I'm getting 16.5mpg on my first tank of gas since most of my driving are local. Japanese and European car manufactures, are you scared?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Agile handling, smooth riding, dual oversized sunroofs, HUD, interior quality (as good as Japanese and European luxury cars) and roomy 3rd row seat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After narrowing the choice down to either the Acadia, or the Mazda CX-9, we went with the Acadia - and we couldn't be happier! My two boys love the dual sunroofs and the DVD Entertainment system. Handling is outstanding and the ride comfort is better than expected. Minimal road noise allows for easy adult conversation while the kids are entertained. My wife loves the power liftgate and remote start features. We Haven't had it long enough to judge fuel economy - still on my first tank ! This one can stand up to an import any day!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've had it a month - already taken a 1,000+ mile trip... bottom line is that we love it. Feels as big as a Tahoe [we've had one of those] but handles as well as the Jeep Grand Cherokee [we've had 4 of those...] on the road. This is an AWD model [with every goodie except the cargo area audio control] to help with the snow we get from time to time but off-road was not a consideration for us. I am impressed with the fit and finish as others have said - much more upscale than the similar model from Saturn [and the Acadia price was the same as the price for the Saturn]. The navigation system is superb - the best one that I have ever seen -- very easy to operate.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 'captains' seats makes sitting in the backseat enjoyable - even for tall/big guys [like me...] The front passenger area though is what we like best - very comforatbale - lots of room - and even with a full load we got 20 mpg on our first trip [I hope we attain closer to 24mpg on regular trips]</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love the SUV. I am surprised how many heads have turned and asked what is that. Owned a Lexus previosly and did not get those kind of head turns. Ride is very smooth. Great Interior and craftmanship. great turn radius, plenty of room even in the 3rd row. love the dual sunroofs. 19 inch wheels make a big difference. great paint job on the outside. Great handling and fun to drive. beats van we traded in. almost same size as van as far as room. Only downside is fuel economy so far as been subpar. Only 12-14 mpg but just got SUV a week ago so still under 400 miles, heard it takes a while to break in vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My driving experience has been excellent. Very hard car to find on dearlership lots. My previous vehicle was a 2002 Envoy XL. I was disappointed with GM's decision not continue Envoy XL (3rd row) for 2007. However, this vehicle makes up the difference in a big way. I am very pleased with the design and technology for the vehicle. It really should priced higher than listed on the window. I purchased a fully loaded Acadia and it will take me sometime to figure out all the capabilities included on this vehicle. Way to go GM, finally it feels good again that an American manufacturer has step up to the plate with a very good design. Excellent family vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Changed from a H2 to this crossover. GMC listened to the consumer! A lot of storage comparments, sliding center armrest, well positioned cup holders, electric liftgate etc. The leather seats are very comfortable. Steering is height adjustable and telescopic. Very large rear doors allow for very easy entry to the rear seats. Driving this car is a blast. The interior is very luxurious and quiet. I highly recommed the HUD. Airbags everywhere! Sliding/reclining second row captain seats are awesome. You sit down to take command in this crossover and everything just feels right. It has a very attractive instument cluster. The exterior is very appealing. Go take a look! We love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After looking at number of different CUVs / SUVs, we chose the Acadia. Partly because it is a new vehicle and American made, but mostly because we felt it was the best vehicle in the category. In case you are wondering, I do consider this vehicle to be in the same category as the XC90, RX350, MDX, 4Runner, and Pilot (all of which we looked at carefully and considered buying). The GMC name certainly does not carry the prestige, but the style, features, and initial quality of this car meets or exceeds them all (although time will tell in the reliability department). This is a great riding vehicle and has outstanding interior space (similar to Tahoe) for its deceptive exterior size.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>5 yr / 100k mile powertrain warranty, expected mileage (18/26 for FWD models), Tri-zone air, remote start, power liftgate, mem and heated seats, rear audio (separate from head unit using headphones), dual row capt chairs, 3rd row access, storage. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I feel a little guilty being so excited about a vehicle! I got the carbon metallic w/ titanium leather - fully loaded. I traded in a 2004 Acura MDX, nice car - but never drove as comfortably as my Acadia. It's like GMC took all the features in my MDX - and improved on every one. It's very practical, convenient and handsome. My Acura was the first non American car I ever bought. I'm proud to be back! Grandkids have dubbed it my Nana-Mobile!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love my new Acadia. Fit and finish was excellent. Engine is powerful, smooth and refined. My car does not exibit the acceleration lag reported by others and which I personally noticed when I test drove another Acadia and the Outlook. Wonder if I'm lucky or GM reprogrammed the transmission. The car turned the head of my brother in law who swore off American cars as well as the neighbors. The interior is so nice most could not believe it was a GM product. Ride is smooth and it handles extremely well, especially given it's large size. Much more fun to drive than a minivan and significantly more refined than a SUV. Plenty of leg room in all 3 rows and and still room for luggage in the back.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powerful refined engine. Very comfortable leather seats. Good looking exterior and interior. Fold flat 2nd row for easy access to 3rd row. Dual sun roof and DVD system. 19" wheels give it an agile ride. Very quiet (no road or wind noise).</FAVORITE>

Interior is nicely refined and very quiet. Rear legroom is unrivaled by any other vehicle. Rear sliding seat gives an extra 4 inches if needed for back seat passenger.

When they are not with us the cargo space is just what we need. With the trailoring package we can take our UTV up to our property in the north country with no problems. We have an extended cab 4x4 truck so the Acadia rounds our options for our diversified lifestyle perfectly. I would highly recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought. You should go look at car if you have a growing family.The car has standard bucket seats(credit if you want bench) The third seat is removable and the middle row moves foward and back. Adults comfortable in 3rd row. The pricing is like shopping for a Honda. You do not have to pay for all those extra options.They have FD and AWD. It is decieving from the outside and roomy inside. I love it. I also know it is first year out but it has everything I want in a luxury car without the price. Great Job GMC on your crossover. So far good gas mileage . Have not truly broken in yet. Still under the 500 mark.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just picked up our loaded GMC Acadia Friday night and are extremely happy. The vehicle is well built inside and out and is a pleasure to drive. Lots of bells and whistles to keep you occupied in your spare time. I'm 6'2" and I have more than enough room. This vehicle drives so smoothly, it feels like your driving 55 when you're really going 85(oops!). Handling is superior to other vehicles we've owned. It's a real head turner when your driving down the road. I saw numerous Envoy owners trying to catch up with us to get a peak. The Acadia will be a real winner for GMC. The motor has more than enough power to get up and go. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone. Watch out Soccer Moms!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We absolutely love our 2 year Acadia. It is fun to drive and drives like a car-very smooth! The only complaint we have is the interior light of the digital clock/radio and odometer/exterior temp read-outs. (Hope fully, this has been changed with the future models) but, the lighting on these read-outs is so dim, that during the daytime hours it is very difficult, if not impossible, to see the readouts! Quite an oversight on GMC. The Enclave utilizes a green back light for these read outs, which is much easier to read/effective!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Should have known better than to buy a new American vehicle in its 1st year of production, but I was absolutely smitten by the design. Had issues with excessive road noise on the highway, but that was finally resolved after almost a year with new tires (the original Fortera tires were defective). Car handles nice and tight on the hwy with decent acceleration and comfort. However, mileage has never been as good as advertised. Worse thing is intermittent roof leaks that have required 4 or 5 trips to the dealership! Thank goodness I bought the GM Protection Plan extended warranty. Wonder if it will do me any good once GM goes bankrupt? I will think three times before buying a GM product again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We needed a larger vehicle as our family is getting bigger, and sold a Honda Civic for this family room on wheels. It fits everything, from baby seats, a dog, tons of luggage, coolers, and gets you from A to B comfortably. We knew gas would be more expensive coming from a 32 mpg Civic, but the size and comfort level are well worth the sacrifice. The funny thing is that people don't realize that these are like minivans on the inside, and can accomodate many passengers with the utmost comfort. The truck has taken up a bit more space in the garage than expected, but we'll get by. This will be in our family for a long time, and I would suggest this vehicle to anyone consaidering a minivan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought in March, paying much more for this vehicle than another we considered. We mainly got it for the promised MPG. It has not lived up to my expectations at all. The gas mileage is horrible (12-14 in town, 19-10 hwy), and I am a very conservative driver. It's been in the shop about 5 times in 6 months (minor issues, but still!) The gold paint job is evidently not very good. There was a small scratch when we got it, which we touched up. Since then, it has gotten many more scratches from items that don't normally scratch off car paint. The AC doesn't work well when outside temp is 80 or below, although it is great in the hottest part of the summer (and we have black interior.)</TEXT>

The first problem we incountered was the seatbelts tearing, (We are now on the fourth seatbelt for the diver side and still having a problem). The second problem was the back compartment door that would not close. The sunroof leaks causing the passenger side floor board to get wet from a drain tube not installed properly, (still having problems with this). We also had the software upgrade. The preformance since has been alot better, but the gas mileage has dropped tramendous, 14 city, 19 highway. We are very disapointed with this vehicle over all.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched this vehicle for several months before making the purchase. In the 1 yr that I have owned the vehicle it has been in the shop multiple times for various reasons. The first 3 times was because the passenger side floor board was flooded because the drain from the sunroof was not installed and when my dealer did install it it was done incorrectly. Then carpet had to be replaced. Transmission in the vehicle is not what it should be. I had the software update, but car continues to shift up and down with little regard to terrain Now it is in the shop related to what they say are body seam cracks.

<TEXT>The car is very comfortable and I feel very safe - 2 of the reasons I purchased the vehicle. However, the main reason I purchased the vehicle was because of the advertised fuel mileage which has turned out to be a bold faced lie. It is supposed to get 16-24mpg and we are lucky to get 12- 18mpg! I have taken it in to a dealership and called GMC on 2 different occasions with no resolution. They basically just say they will "document my concern". A lot of help that is! My next car purchase will definately not be a GMC!</TEXT>

My whole family, especially my kids loving it. They don't want to ride on other vehicles exception this one. My kids ususally have nice sleep and they wouldn't get tired when wake-up after a long trip. I got average 16-18 in city and 22-24 on highway. I really don't like its 6-speed transmission shiftings.

<TEXT>I've had my Acadia for close to a year and a half and still absolutely love the vehicle. For the first year we were extremely disappointed with the mpg. I drove a country road to work - with one stop two stop signs on it-18 miles,and about 10 miles driving "in- town." I now keep my speed under 60 mph out of town, I don't pass anyone unless they're driving under 50 mph (like farm equipment), I accelerate slower and coast when approaching a stop sign, I always shut the car off and walk-in(no drive-ups at the bank, McD's, etc.)and wow what a difference! I've gotten on average 24 mpg, in two months it's been between 22 mpg and 28 mpg. A savings of 4 gallons per week - You do the math!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is fun to drive once you reach 20 or so mile per hour, but until then it seems to be hesitant to shift into lower gears to give the needed power for moving around in City traffic. I have had the transmission calibrated a couple of times and it helps for a while then it goes back to hesitating. Also the fuel mileage is not even close to what was advertised on the window sticker. The sticker said I should get 18 City and 24 Highway MPG. I get 14 City and 18 to 19 Highway. I asked the service reps about it and they kind of shrug and say "thats about normal". Otherwise I like the car a lot and have no real mechanical problems.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned an SLT-1 FWD Acadia for about 8 months and have not regretted the decision one bit. I went with the black metallic exterior with "brick" interior, and can't believe how nice that combination looks. I continue to get compliments in that regard. The 20" tires/rims really make the vehicle stand out. The ride is rather smooth (especially on the open rode) and the handling is very nimble. What I really find impressive is the roominess of the interior. It is very easy to move around and and change the seating positions (having captian's chairs is particularly nice). I considered buying the Mazda MX-9, Volvo XC-90 and the Acura MDX. The Acadia is a much better looking vehicle imo.</TEXT>

It's perfect for me and my family. I also ride a sport bike and the tow hitch on the back is perfect for pulling our enclosed trailer as well. You can't go wrong with this truck. It looks good, you feel safe and secure with OnStar and XM radio and the rest of the bells and whistles. But just like most vehicles this size, it could be better in the gas mileage category. Fortunately I kept my 96 Mazda Protege when I got this so my Acadia is strictly for the weekends and leisure. Way to go GM!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Acadia for one year and I love it! I did the transmission software update and it made a big difference. Unfortunately the dealership goofed it up when they did it and it was registering 3.1 miles on the odometer for every one mile I drove. I checked the mileage with with the highway milemarkers. The front end makes a clunking noise when just starting to take off. I learned from another review that the clunking noise is the anti-lock breaking system engaging. Other than these two issues I love my Acadia! I hope everyone else's issues are resolved quickly. </TEXT>

There are some issues with the front tire sensors constantly saying check tire pressure or icey roads may occur even when it is warm and tires are inflated properly. Our oldest child has very little room in the third seat and it is not easy to get to the oil filter when servicing. Also a little big for the transmission, seems to shift very frequently or seems to be under a load constanly. A/C is not up to par </TEXT>

<TEXT>The ride & handling of this SUV is not as good as my previous SUVs, ie the Honda Pilot or Landrover Disco II, but the interior space & layout more than make up for that. This is an SUV built more for the riders than the driver. The engine is a bit lacking in power due to the weight, & an average of 14 mpg city & 17 mpg on the hwy is a bit disappointing. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very easy to get in & out with 2nd row captains chairs. Good Nav unit, seems to be well built. Love the trunk space with or without putting 3rd row seats down.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>buying another</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I am looking now to buy another. Fuel economy 19.7 in town 24.3 on highway. Simply a pleasure to drive and not afraid to move 6/7 people. Have not had one problem with Acadia. Would suggest staying with front wheel drive after driving first winter, no traction problems and better mileage. Quiet ride and have to watch the speed as it likes to get down the highway very good responsiveness. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling on wet/ice covered/snow packed roads. First, second and third seats very comfortable for a 250 lb person. The auto rear hatch allowing you to walk up and put bags in back. Very happy with performance. Excellent braking, quality build </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really like this SUV because of the size and special features. We did have the power steering pump replaced within the frist three months, Which wasn;t really a big deal. In the fourth month of ownership, this SUV became demon posessed. Brake light comes on with a very loud beeping that does not stop and the park assist light flashes that the park assist is off. Three trips to the dealership and they still can't fix this problem! The only way to stop this is to pull off the road, set and release the park brake. the plus side to this is that it only happens when it rains. four resets in one trip from NJ to NC. There is also water in the passenger floorboard when it rains.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sunroofs, console features, Seats are comfortable for trips less than 2 hours! Overall size of the SUV is great! MPG is around 21 to 22, not to bad! Good overall SUV!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my Acadia 3 mo. ago and love it. We drove a 2 day trip from Texas to NYC with 4 kids was a little cramped. Do wish it came standard with hitch and luggage bars. Most people travel and this would be helpful. Paint does tend to chip easier than my old Envoy XL but, overall I am very happy with my new car. Had to make emergency trip for medical reasons and must say we got up to 125mph and was smooth as could be and handles like a dream. If your thinking on buying jump on it. I love mine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving Volvos for the past 5 yrs, came back to GMC, worried about reliability, but the Volvo was also unreliable and expensive to repair, so here goes. Enjoying it so far. Opted for the 60/40 second row bench and am happy about that. Unless you are carrying a bunch of folks, the back seat goes unused anyway, so I either fold it or leave it up. The kids can't run between the seats either! Daughter is enjoying the DVD option and the rear controls are easy enough for a 4 year old to operate! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drives like a much smaller car, DVD, satellite radio and OnStar, iPod connections (even the Mercedes had this optional...it's standard here), very roomy and easy for tall people to get in and out of, even in the back seats! Can't wait for a long trip in this one!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've had our Acadia since May '07, and we love it! Everyone who rides in it loves it as well. Our Acadia is comfortable and has a smooth ride. There are so many great things about this car that they far outweigh any negatives. The chrome accents in the interior look sharp but do sometimes reflect sun into your eyes. Initially had sluggish transmission, but GMC had software recall and since has been shifting much better. Gas mileage has improved since update as well; however, not as good as sticker rated mpg. Overall great choice. We're so pleased GM designed this vehicle. Great family car. Plenty room with sporty look and feel. Go test drive and you'll be hooked.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Acadia but I'd love it a lot more if it was dependable. We bought this car to be the new family ride but 2 weeks after purchasing it, we started having problems. The car won't start at times and we need a jump to get it going. Once started runs fine. This is not a cold start problem and the battery has been replaced, and it still has problems. The dealership has been great trying to solve the problems but the manufacturer rep. and the car itself have been a little difficult. We have named our car "Sybill" and are now considering the "lemon law" to get it replaced. </TEXT>

The wheel well is not located forward. The only item I can see that needs adjustment is the seat belts for the center person. They should be able to fold down after applying the seat belt. They stick right up straight into your backside making for an uncomfortable ride. Other than that the vehicle is perfect in every way.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We saw this car on the showroom floor, took it for a test drive and were completely overwhelmed with ride quality, comfort and styling. It's the most stylish vehicle we've ever owned with features we thought we would never be able to afford in an automobile. The dashboard and console are nicely designed with all controls at your fingertips. The dual sunroof is really cool, letting in plenty of light. Radio controls in the back are great for tailgate party's and there's plenty of space for storage in the back. This summer, we towed a 19 foot boat and a storage area full of gear from behind the front seats to the rear tailgate with no loss of power, handling or ride quality.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This may sound minor but GM placed a very small pinpoint light which shines down on the area containing shift lever, cup holders and storage area. A small feature that makes it very easy to find coffee cups, or stuff stored in the console area during night driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car performed wonderfully for the first 4K miles, but since then has been nothing but trouble. As many others have stated, the car began to leak from underneath the glove box due to a faulty hose leading from the sunroof. The car was in the shop 3 times for a total of 27 days before the leak was fixed. The emergency brake also malfunctioned due to a faulty switch, which was replaced and works fine now. Overall, most problems were minor, but have been quite a headache to deal with. Besides those issues, the car has been a blast to drive. It performed wonderfully on a trip to Florida recently, with an average highway mileage of 24.5mpg, and comfortably seated 5 adults plus luggage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The heads-up display, power lift gate, LED brake lights, and HID headlights are by far my favorite features. The Bose stereo sounds simply amazing, and the MP3 input is great for traveling.

We are lucky no one got killed yet and GMC will not refund our money and they know this car is a death trap and I have 3 children endangering their lives by driving this crap.Unbelievable!!

I did take a long hours trip without stop and traffic. Highway mileage was about 24-25 mi/g. In city or during rush hour traffic, I could get upto 15- 16 mi/g. I really enjoy when driving my Acadia.

<TEXT>I like my Acadia AWD, but it does have some drawbacks. The gas mileage is no where near what it should be. I bought the vehicle thinking that the gas mileage was a bit better than my previous SUV 4wd, but it isn't. The continuous shifting on the CVT transmission eats gas. Another problem is the vehicle is extremely difficult to backup. There are many blind spots in this vehicle that should be looked at. If a small car comes up behind you and you can only see the roof, there is a definite problem. There are also blind spots where the front seats and door jams meet causing a big blind spot when looking out the passenger side window. I do like the size and comfort of the vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>6000 Miles down and we love this vehicle. We moved from a minivan to this and what a difference. We have the White Diamond color with the Brick interior. It is really an eye catcher. We have had repeated compliments on the car. It is very nice looking. Ride quality is good, fuel economy fine, and we have found this car to be the most comfortable we've ever had. We took it on a 2000 mile road trip and I have never felt as relaxed driving long distance nor did I feel over tired after 8-10 hours of driving. The car has great handling and feels smaller than it is. Highly recommended. The only thing we haven't tested is snow performance. I'm curious how it will handle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After enjoying my Envoy for nearly 90,000 miles, the Acadia has been a great step forward in size, economy and ride. My only dislike is the transmission's desire to get into overdrive too early and wanting to stay there too long. This makes driving using the cruise control unpleasant with frequent agressive down shifting on even very small increases in grade. Two computer updates have helped significantly but the frequency of the shifting is still quite annoying. One other design flaw for me ,is the inability to open the rear gate window. Makes bringing long items home more of a challenge. It will be interesting to watch the developement of this vehicle over the next few years. </TEXT>

A totally different experience in the "SUV World".

If we have friends that are joining us, he always offers to pick them up! What a switch! I wish everyone in the "SUV World" would test drive an Acadia. They would experience what I am talking about! The Acadia is certainly a new experience for us and I am sure we will continue to purchase them in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The comfort of the car is outstanding, but it does not get close to the 26 mpg on the highway as advertised and it is extremely slugglish going up any type of hill or passing a vehicle. We did take it to the dealership, but they couldn't find anything wrong. Also the radio system, a Bose, is good but you can't distinguish the back speakers from the front. The folding down of the 3rd seat is really easy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Driving comfort, the looks of the vehicle, and it takes curves really well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had never heard of this crossover when I was looking to replace my 2003 Rendezvous, I had almost given up on current SUV models when I stumbled on this perfectly equiped Acadia on the dealer's floor. Aside from the minor problem with the transmission downshifting, I'd put this ahead of any other crossover on the market. Why doesn't GMC do more to market these?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's all good. The range of options and their design is the best. My grandchildren think it's the coolest car they've ridden in.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I absolutely love this car. I don't feel that it's a big vehicle, even though it is quite large. I recommend this car to everyone that has a minivan and hates them.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the interior.....for my 5 kids it's perfect. It's like having a minivan, but when the kids are in school, I'm not stuck driving around in a minivan!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great vehicle, howevver transmission is a disaster. MPG is bad. FM reception is bad. HUD (heads up display) works intermittently. Seats get uncomfortable on long trips. Hands free calling is poorly thought out. Bluetooth would be a better option. Turn by Turn Navigation downloads fail often. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>HUD...I wish it always worked.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Acadia. Super comfy, super safe. Had brand new Ford Expedition, only 1 yr old, traded in because Ford is not reliable. I also had a new Tahoe, not comfortable at all. This vehicle has a lot more space than you'd think. I have 2 children in car seats, plenty of room. Bought the vehicle because it has 10 airbags. I get compliments all over the place about what a sharp looking vehicle it is. My only complaint is that I have no A/C controls for the back seat within my reach while I'm driving. I have to stop and reach back to adjust it, which can be a pain at times. There should be controls in the front and the back. Besides that, I love teh Acadiaand plan on keeping it</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks great inside and out. Love the airbags. Love that the 2nd and 3rd row seats fold completely flat. Love the Bose surround sound, especially when watching a movie. Navigation System is so convenient. Already used OnStar to unlock, accidentally locked kids in, OnStar unlocked in seconds. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Unfortunately my two month old Acadia was already hit pretty hard ($6000+damage) and it took it so well. Everyone at the scene could not believe it held up so well. The other car was totalled. I love this car and can't wait to get it back. We got all the features we wanted and for an unbeleivable price. It feels so much bigger inside than it looks on the outside, but it still drives like it is small, I love that.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love all the features!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Drives well for the first 2000 miles, gas mileage 22 on the road,14 on lots of up and down roads in the NC mountains which is not bad. Comfort of seats very good with lumbar, lots of storage, removed 3rd seats and rear storage compartment (for the trip) which provides additional room for everything your bringing along due to added height (about 8")in the rear area. The optional method of shifting manually while in low range seems to work well in the mountains on steep grades. Fuel gauge seems to operate in correctly when parked on hills, giving false reading lower than it actually is. Once it is driven for a while it returns to correct operation. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The feature of limiting the transmission to an intermediate gear in the low range. The remote start is great for starting AC when approaching vehicle in hot weather. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drive approx 100 mi per day as a delivery vehicle, lots of idleing time, and average 15 mpg. Thats OK for a 4500 lb comfortable vehicle. Can hardly wait to go on a trip. The chrome dash ac vents reflect in the rear view mirror and is somewhat distracting. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought on July 4, 2007, it is now Aug 7. Compared many cars including very expensive imports like Lexus and Infiniti. This car doesn't look too large but IT IS!! Heavy! Safe!! You can carry a lot! Bought the most expensive model. This is a wonderful car! Does not lean in turns like our old SUV. No problems at all so far. Did not notice the glare (other reviewers). This car has many premium features, see some below. It all works just fine, at a reasonable price, too! Just ecstatic about this purchase, recommend this car highly!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Man! Try to get all these in another car for the price: Heads-up display, XM, Power Folding Mirrors, DVD player, Nav system, Dual moon roofs, quad captain's chairs, AC outlet, Tire pressure monitoring system, heated seats & mirrors, heated window washer fluid (good in CO).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We traded in our 2005 Yukon for this vehicle. We're not sorry we did. The interior and exterior are nicely put together. It seems like GM is finally trying to do things right. It is fun and comfortable to drive. Overall, we're pleased with the vehicle, but think some things can be improved on. First, the mileage, while better than the Yukon, is not what they advertise it to be. Second, the sun visors are useless for sun coming in from the side. These need to be longer or have an extender built in. Last, the Navigation system DVD is not perfected. The unit keeps freezing up. We have had out unit replaced twice now.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The overall design, 19" tires, Navigation System, rear DVD player for the grandkids, On-Star, the sun roof, the seating, the ease at which the 3rd row folds down, and the Heads-up display. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We rented this for 4 days, and I must say, GM has come a long way from my Dads 1991 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. This one had pretty much everything except navigation. Drove very nice, Good acceleration, but the transmission seems to want to shift up too quick. Radio lacks treble. Build quality could be better, some really badly aligned panels on side of seat (rubs console when moving seat). Remote start wouldn't work consistently. Fuel economy seems low, used about 3/4 tank in about 200 miles (a/c on always). Handles good for a large car. Too much chrome inside, looks a bit cheap. Ugly Tail-light design (like the LED though). 2nd row seat folding design seems fragile, may not last.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this SUV! So roomy and fun to drive. Gas mileage could be better but pretty much what I expected. Love the dual sunroof, the third row seats that lay down flush when needed, and the feel of the drive. Many looks come my way when I drive it and I can't get my husband to drive his truck now! He always wants to drive my Acadia! </TEXT>

<TEXT>First let me say that I absolutely love my Acadia - but hate the performance and mileage. I thoroughly researched and special ordered one. I have to admit that I did not heed prior reviewers' warnings about the mileage and the sluggish transmission, so I take responsibility for my disappointment. I test drove 4 different Acadias and rented one for a weekend and never experienced nearly as bad mileage or the very sluggish response when it is needed most. The closest I can compare it to is a clogged air filter or fuel line. I had it checked and was told it was operating perfectly. If mileage and performance are high on your priority list, you should look elsewhere. If not, you'll love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After having the Acadia for for 6 months still love it. Made 2 trips to NY from Flordia. was great too drive and was the most comfortable of all the vehicles I've owned. GM definitely outdid all the competition with this crossover. Looking at getting a second Acadia when I trade My Pontiac GXP in early 2008. GM has put pride back in building and owning an American vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were shopping BMX X5 and Lexus RX350 and ended up with an Acadia! We just happened to hear about the Acadia and in head to head test drives, we preferred it. To be honest, we were surprised even though we also have had great experience with a Yukon we got several years ago. With the Acadia, we found the combination of vehicle style, features, smooth and quiet ride, etc that just was everything we were looking for. We now have gone on one 10 day vacation and have 4K miles on the Acadia and we like it more and more every day. Not one defect to date! With our last car (German), we had 6 defects within the 1st month. A tip of the hat to GMC for the Acadia!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heads up display is so cool, Nav system is too. Also, being able to watch the DVD on the nav system when in park. Remote engine start is a fun feature as is the power lift gate. The dual sun roof concept is great and the sunshades filter just right amount of light. We're hooked on XM too</FAVORITE>
