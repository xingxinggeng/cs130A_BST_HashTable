<TEXT>Test drove and researched reviews and maintenance histories of the big three, and settled on the Chevy to pull my 5th Wheel. I'm so impressed that I'm taking the time to post this review, and like other reviewers, I have nothing but praise for the Duramax/Allison pwertrain - quiet and dependable, this is one towing beast. Pulled my 14,000 lb trailer coast-to- coast, up and over the White Mountains while passing cars climbing the hills. While the comment about "acres of plastic" is true, and I find the exterior styling less appealing than similar Fords, I bought it to haul and stay out of the shop, and it does both better than the competition. This is a great truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Duramax/Allison powertrain are the best on the civilian market - put the Allsion in "tow mode" and install a Prodigy brake controller and you'll never know the trailer's back there!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After much discussion between gas and diesel, we went with the Duramax. Just awesome is all I can say. We just pulled a 4 horse trailer cross country, 9 days and 6500 miles later my back was not even sore from the ride. Engine never slowed across any of the mountains. Plenty of room to lay out in the back and sleep while trading off driving. I revamped some built in headrest dvd players from an H3 and they look great. Should be an option.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Duramax and Allison tranny, easy and fun to drive, engine brake in tow haul mode (great)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased to pull a trailer and love it so much it has become my daily driver. It has plenty of power and fuel mileage is acceptable due to the diesel and Allison 6 speed transmission. I live in snow country and the 4wd, heated seats, defrosters are all excellent.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Diesel engine, Allison trans, heated leather seats, large extendable heated mirrors, OnStar, XM radio on the Bose system</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great riding and driving truck! Can handle the occassional work load well! Good reliabilty! The new six speed automatic transmission is a dissappointment! I currently still own a 2500hd classic with the old 4 speed automatic trans and under similar driving conditions cosistently gets 3.1 miles per gallon better fuel economy! I would have expected the 6 speed to get better fuel economy than the old one! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great Interior design and comfort! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just traded a Dodge 1500 Hemi for this 2007 2500HD with the Vortec 8100 and Allison six speed automatic. Wow this thing really goes! It is better than the old 454 engine. I needed a lot of pulling capacity but did not need the expense of the DuraMax, this really fills the need. Gas mileage is about 12.5 mpg around town and 14.5 on the highway and it loves regular gas. Drivers seat is much better than the Dodge was. Steering is not quite as good, seems to wander at high speeds. Could be the E load tires compared to the 20" tires on the Dodge. Attention Dodge owners: Chevy dealers will not give you anything on trade if you have a 05-07 Dodge. Overall very strong truck. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Vortec 8100 , Allison Automatic and 4.10 gears make for a real puller.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Duramax w/ Allison Trans is the way to go. I regularly pull a 13.5K fifth wheel and sometimes forget it is back there. Rides better than my SUV, gets better fuel economy (gotta love a diesel) and has all the same creature comforts. I would definitely buy again, although I'm thinking I won't have to.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Diesel - fuel efficiency and cost can't be beat. Leather and Bose surround aren't bad either.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just got this 2500HD with the 6.0 gas engine and I love it. Even though this is the basic W/T version, it gives me plenty of cash to play with to make changes. Ride is great for a 3/4 ton even with "E" tires. Interior is nice and I enjoy having the 40/20/40 bench seat. Easy to clean just like my wife's Element with the vinyl flooring (not missing the carpet). Just added a performance exhaust and love the sound and launch!!! FYI, I've been driving diesels for the last 8 years and loved them, but missed the raw power of the gas engine. Trade-off is the low mileage though, but loads of fun to drive and cheap to insure! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the sound of a big bore engine! Terrific ride! Pulls hard like a truck should with a 4:10 rear end. Simple to clean inside and out. The "Sleeper" clean looks of the old day street rods.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the nicest truck on the road hands down. I test drove all 3 competitors (Ford, Dodge and Chevy) and Chevy takes the cake. The ride is superior, engine is loud like the powerstroke and cummins, more HP(365 and more torque 660 lbs) very roomy and comfortable. Just needs bigger tires. Price is more and I could of got a diesel for 40 grand but hey 45 grand for a Chevy and that truck is worth it. 5 stars</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The gas pedal when the rpms get over 2k...man that turbo kicks in big time! Also like that the Chevy has the OnStar. I feel safer, especially when wife and newborn baby are with me. Can't beat it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is an awesome truck! I am super impressed with the power and acceleration of the Duramax/Allison combination. The ride is excellent and very quiet. The interior is not super flashy but it is very driver friendly. It also seats my family of 5 and my black lab very well (Crew Cab).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Duramax engine and the Allison transmission make this a super truck.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am very impressed with this truck. It is the Duramax Diesel(LBZ 6.6l) with Allison Transmission. It's solid truck that drives extremely well. It is very quiet for a diesel. My kids actually fall asleep in it when we are on the highway because it is so smooth. Although, this truck has a lot of power! I like the body style but if I could change one thing it would be the tiny tires they put on this hulking truck. It really hurts the overall look of it and most buyers of this truck change them immediately anyways. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are the Duramax and Allison. Together they are the best combination on the market</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great truck! The ride is better than either Dodge or Ford across my dirt roads. On the highway it does not ride as well as my wife's Suburban, but still much better than the other trucks I have. Handles well, better than most trucks that are not "sporterized". I test drove all three domestic truck lines and this was head and shoulders above the competition. Fuel mileage is low, but this is probably due to the engine break in period.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE> I have the diesel and it accellerates much better than my Dodge 2500 with a Cummins. Less chatter, but a clear turbo-diesel sound. Brakes are outstanding. Pricing is steep compared to other trucks, but hey, it is a Chevy.</FAVORITE>
