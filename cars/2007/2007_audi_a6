<TEXT>I had an Audi A6 2.7 2000 which I loved and was very much the sports car. The A6 3.2 2008 is not as sporty but is a great car to drive. The sound system is the best I've ever owned. The gas mileage is unbelievable with in city averaging over 21 and highway over 30. The car is great car for trips and would highly recommend it to anyone. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sound system which you can control whether it is front, back or driver. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The A6 4.2 is my first German luxury sedan, having previously enjoyed both Volvo and Acura sedans. The A6 clearly outclasses, and out-performs, these models, as it should for its premium price. Overall, I am very pleased with this car after 20,000 miles. It has been mechanically sound, is safe and comfortable, has classic euro lux sedan good looks, and delivers great performance. Two things have really impressed me. First, the quattro AWD -- it performs in all weather conditions;I won't have another car without AWD. Second, fuel economy - it is very good for a powerful V8, I often get 26-28 on the highway even when I'm pushing the pace. The navigation and MMII systems are lackluster.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, performance, safety, the A6 is near perfection in size, comfort, quality, and attention to detail. The quattro AWD is terrific. The 19" alloy wheels are stunning and really give the A6 a wow factor. The same for the interior - it's form and function is impressive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd certified used Audi A6, the 1st was an Avant that I kept until 185,000 miles and it still drove like new. This 2007 certified used Audi had 27,000 miles when I bought it and I haven't had a single problem. All the power I can use and all I do is think about passing and the next thing I know I'm past in absolute silence and total control. The brakes are amazing, but rather touchy and take some getting used to. I average 27 mpg and 32 on the highway doing 70-75. Nav is fast, accurate and easy, Bose radio rocks, steering and handling great. My speedometer is 3 mph fast and the front cupholders aren't great - otherwise nothing compares for this 6'2" 220 pounder</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine/trans; Quattro; Nav; stability, handling, smoothness and quiet at all speeds; mileage and gas tank size; strong brakes with brake assist; comfort; reliability; interior and exterior styling - so - just about everything</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My car is actually the Audi A6 2.0 TSI and it has what it takes to make it big among its German stablemates. The design flair is obvious; keep it conservative, but let it age with style. The build quality has improved from my 2000 Audi A6 with the feel of this car leaning more towards the A8 than it does to the A4. The handling is still nimble and oh so much fun in S-shift, especially when taking off at the lights. The Jekyll and Hyde personality shift is scary! The sound system is pure pleasure and adds to the ambience of the car... that is, until things start going wrong.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very sexy design, with the rear end challenging the beauty of Eve. Leg room at the back is expansive. The boot is ginormous. The seats are comfy and the MMI is very intuitive. The burble of the engine, and its roar when it opens up... MMM!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Took delivery Jan 28, 07. Car was delivered spiffy clean and sparkling. So far, no serious defects of any kind - rather amazing in a complex machine. Only a few minor complaints: front cupholders could use redesign - one is under the armrest, which needs to be lifted to use cupholder. Windshield wiper moisture sensors work but not precisely enough - you need to "help" them along sometimes. Occasionally, there is a very slight hesitation when starting up from idle - seems to have lessened as time goes by - maybe I am getting used to it?? Very slight rattle in glove box door- needs adjustment?. Thats IT!! This is a "serious" car - took fanatical attention to detail to build. Fun to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Attractive styling and general appearance, good handling, excellent gas mileage, engine power - excellent for a mid-size six, wood trim is beautifully made, MMI is easy to use in spite of what some say. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I took delivery of my car and the brakes were very loud the salesman told me this was just a temporary problem and would go away-it has only been worse. Srevice dept reply-brakes squeak. My 4 other vehicles do not have squeaky brakes. The worst problem however is the delayed acceleration at slow speeds. I will not let other family members drive this car, it is not safe and again the service reps say that's just the way it is! I will never buy another. I own 2 Lexuses and have had no problems that were not taken care of ditto that for the 2 BMWs. Audi's indifference to these acknowledged problems is beyond belief.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched all german and japanese sedans in the $40,000 to $60,000 range and Audi was one of the last I drove. I have been driving BMWs since the late 70s owning the 3 and 5 series. Audi's A6 reliability got better reviews the last few years so I checked it out. It's very nimble, powerful and just plain fun to drive, plus it's stylish. Being a female, color is important and I love the amaretto interior. Bose sound system cranks too. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Can shift into manual mode. Very responsive and good in snow. Stylish and the interior is attractive and very european.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've driven Acuras for 15 years (Vigor, TL) and loved them. My new 2007 A6 4.2 is my first German car, and I love it. I wanted a 4WD vehicle with large engine and room to fit my bike. I started looking at the BMW X5, Acura RL and MDX, and the Lexus RX. I liked the X5 a lot, but really preferred a sedan. When I discovered the A6 had 350 hp, beautiful interior, and an enormous trunk, I was in. My test drive sealed the deal. I've had the car for 6 weeks and 1,400 mi, and am loving every minute. It's fun to drive with tons of power and lots of class. I'm sure I'll feel some pain in the wallet for service, but Audi's service contract eases that a bit. A big thumbs-up for Audi!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent driver ergonomics. Fine exterior styling. Solid feel. Huge trunk with fold-down rear seats. Power to spare.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this car for 3 months and 2100 miles, city and highway driving. It is easy to maneuver, solid in good and bad weather, very comfortable and very stylish. The MMI has become second nature and is really a lot of fun. The car has computer power that exceeds many desktops. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Excellent design inside and out (understated class). At home at the market or country club. Fit and finish is incredible. The 18" wheels look the best and are surprisingly smooth on the road. Would encourage wheel insurance though as they're easy to nick and scuff. Interior screams luxury - well appointed and roomy. MMI control is much easier to learn than critics say.Upgraded Bose audio is concert hall quality with the surround sound selection. Bluetooth works like a dream. Adaptive headlights are very bright. Good acceleration and braking. Quattro AWD gives excellent handling. Tight turning radius for a big car. Trunk is deep and the back seats fold down (!) easily holding golf bags.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a spectacular car, its handling is excellent, and it grips the road like no other car. It is the nicest design, interior and exterior in its class. Very smooth on the road for the front seats, and has been a very reliable car so far. I drive a lot, it has 16000 miles in less then a year, and so far it has not gone for service except for the regular maintenance. Great AWD as well, drives in the snow beautifully, doesn't slip or slide. Great job Audi. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration, audio system, handling, and AWD. Great on snow and in rain. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a very impressive car. Love the power in sport mode. Build quality is awesome. Traded a 2006 A3 2.0 with DSG. I miss the lightning quick paddles and DSG would be a great addition to this vehicle. The trunk is huge. I have not tested this, but I am guessing that I could fit 4 golf bags in it. Can't wait to burn up the miles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Since purchase, the car presented steering and eletrical problems. Audi USA claims the vehicle is operating to specs. It drifts left and right. Several alignments and hundreds of dollars later, I just got used to the way it behaves. Electrical problems include warning lights that will not go off. Stereo not working. MMI malfunction. Undercarriage plastic protection ripped off with RAIN WATER. Plastic parts wear off too fast. The AWD feature is very nice and helps with the handling. The interior is very nice. Hopefully Audi will master their product eventually. I will not be a repeat buyer though. Front bumper comes off when parking.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is soooo awesome. It drives like a dream. The luxury amenities are truly luxurious. The nav is awesome. The capability of calling friends by voice command and bluetooth technology will allow me to never get a ticket. It is so beautiful both on the inside and the outside. I am having so much fun figuring out how to use the console to its fullest potential.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The beautiful yellow wood interior and the console, sirius radio and the nav system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Audi A6 3.2 Quattro S-Line virtually embodies my vision of what a luxury performance sedan should be. Quattro four-wheel-drive provides incredible control, handling, and steering through curves and around corners. S-Line suspension gives "on-rails" feeling. Averaging 22 mpg, while driving it "passionately." Stunning and comfortable interior, with full array of electronics: excellent bluetooth (Treo 700p worked from the start); navigation system (small additional display in front of driver allows larger screen to be freed from map-use), which has been dead-on accurate; wonderful climate system and heated seats bottoms and backs. I love looking at it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Six speed tiptronic transmission can be used in "D" (fuel-efficient gradual acceleration), "S" (very fast acceleration), or shift-for-yourself modes. A bluetooth that mated with my phone in love-at-first-sight fashion. S-Line sport suspension matches handling of my BMW 3-series.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The first thing that is great about the car is its elegant interior, I've owned BMWs and Lexus and MBZs and they all come in a distant second to the interior. The sure footedness of its all wheel drive makes it a fun car to drive, yet not stiff and rugged like it's german relatives. This vehicle is not the quickest off the line but the real world does not live in the 0-60 realm, it is in real driving situations where this car exceeds expectations. The MMI took a while to learn, but who needs it when you have the voice activated commands?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Believe it or not my favorite feature are the hooks in the trunk. The Nav is also a favorite if mine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fast, quiet, responsive, well appointed, bells and whistles aside, I love going to work now. The mountain freeway I drive to and from work is fun now, for the first time in 25 years. It's taking me a little time getting used to the differences of driving from my old car, and 1995 Jeep, where my legs go down in from of me and the steering wheel isn't between my knees. The 2007 A6 is a race car. It hunkers down into turns asking me to push the gas peddle a little further down, as if it wants to go faster. The car has a quality that puts it in a class with any other more expensive car on the road. Consumer reports for the 2007 Audi A6 will be all good, I believe. I couldn?t be more impressed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy with great powerful performance. Grip in turns and high speed. Bluetooth cell phone. Fit and finish inside. Everything seems to be well thought through. Beautiful engineering is the word for this car. The engineers who designed this car, did so because of their love affair with it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I agonized over this car for months Audi vs BMW vs Lexus vs Acura... I am defiinitely very happy. The V8 is quick off the line but is more appreciated when passing on the freeway. S line handling and paddle shifter are fun but not mandatory. New addition is the review camera - which becomes important in the city (bumpers not made for love taps). Interior comfort very similar to the A8. The car is awesome. The Nav is easier to use than BMW. Decent mpg for a V8. The brakes could be a more responsive. Apparently they didn't make too many of the V8 A6s - usually are ordered only - and so you wind up paying more for it (just 1k under MSRP) but is definitely worth it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, luxury, interior and exterior lighting, tech package, nice sunroof, great seats, large trunk space, review camera, the sound of the V8.</FAVORITE>
