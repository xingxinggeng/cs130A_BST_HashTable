<TEXT>I adore my New Beetle. Even though I'm a male, I get compliments from my other guy friends, especially after they've driven it. Convertible a must! The only problem I've had was the wiring harness shorted. Fortunately, the car is still under warranty, and will be back to running soon!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the car new in 2007 and have enjoyed it ever since. Good performance, but the handling could be a little tighter. MPG is constantly around the 30 mark. I have 40000 miles on it and it has not given me any trouble. There were a couple of squeaks/rattles at the beginning but they have since vanished. I would recommend this car from my personal experience. Happy Motoring.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my 2nd Beetle and I absolutely love this car! I recently sold mine since my family needs space. The car is very sturdy and well-built. I was impressed with how well it handled in stormy weather on the interstate. I also loved the space once the back seat folds down. It was spacious enough for my 75 pound Lab in her cage. I never experienced mechanical problems with it. My only complaint was the oil change would cost me $70 or more. This car requires Synthetic oil, which is more expensive than regular oil. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sound system is excellent - the Monsoon System! I also love the gas mileage! I found the seats very comfortable. I owned a Honda Accord once and would often have back aches from the longer rides. However, this did not happen in the Beetle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drove the car from Arizona to Mississippi and back. I got 24 to 30 MPG on the trip driving at an average speed of 75MPH on the interstate. I get 23 - 24 MPG driving around Phoenix on a daily basis. I love the torque. It is hard not to spin the tires from a full stop. I get some strange looks from the Mustang owners when that happens. I am 6'3" and have lots of head room but I had to remove the center arm rest to make room for my elbows. Now there is a big hole in the console but I'm comfortable. The road noise is the one thing I wish was better. Thankfully Phoenix put rubberized asphalt on all the freeways. It is very fun to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine performance and gas mileage. I think the MPG improves the faster you drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife chose this car to replace a Sebring convertible. Wanted a clutch again before we got too old. Performance is adequate at best; acceleration reminds me of my old bugs of my youth. Clutch is not as smooth as Japanese cars. Great head and leg room (I'm six-two). Very quiet with top up at high speeds (much less wind noise than the Sebring). Heated seats (with five settings) are great! Gas mileage is poor (24 mpg) for a small car with a clutch with weak acceleration. Nice, solid build quality, pretty looking, but it is a chick car. Oil change is very expensive due to synthetic only and a non-standard filter. Trunk holds a lot but small opening. I like the car but glad we lease.</TEXT>

<TEXT>4 of us carpool 1 way 30 min. Backseat ok for normal size. Gas mileage could be better but luv, luv my dream car. Someone is always commenting about it as I did for many years b4 I bought it. Coworkers are happy I finally bought it because they were probably tired of me talking about it for about 5 yrs. I don't have a garage, unfortunately, but it is great in the snow. Haven't had any problems to date. Love to go riding on beautiful days with the top down.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Riding with the top down on a beautiful day. When it's a little cool, being able to put the heated seats on. Luv it! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I owned a 2002 SLK and 2003 BMW Z-4. After spending a fortune for upkeep of these two cars I dumped them both and bought a 2007 Convertible, and a 2008 Triple White coupe. They both run circles around my former car. I have homes in both Sacramento and Palm Springs, a ride of 500 miles. Both cars get me there in style and comfort. So far, I have been happy with both. The comfort level and handling has been outstanding. Love the fact that I am putting regular gas in and not the premium I was so use to. I will never do the luxury car route again when I can get a better car in the New Bug.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the Laser Blue color.!! This Beetle is much peppier than the old 2004 - 4 cylinder engine. Only drawback is when you drive fast you get 20 to 23 MPG in the city. The heated seats are the best new feature.! I wish the visors were wider or perhaps extended longer because they don't block side sun glare very well. The comfort is great, and the room is great. I have hauled a lot of stuff in this little car. My only other request is to make this car a hybrid. I have gotten 34 MPG highway using speed control. I beat an Austin Mini Cooper in a drag race and matched a Corvette for the first 50 yards, so this car is FAST.! Thanks VW for a car more fun than my 2004 New Beetle.!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fell in love with the car's look and would be a happy camper if it weren't for all of the little hiccups the car had. I owned this car for 6 months. In those 6 months the top stopped working, the door locks and the cd player malfunctioned, the inside started rattling and squeaking, and the gas gauge broke. This was a 2007 NBC! If you are thinking about buying this car, please keep looking. Maybe a mini? Believe me when I say HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! If you already own one...good luck!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned by Beetle for 7 months and have had no problems. I love this car. At first the look impressed me the most. I finally found a 5-speed, green model which was hard to come by. The way this car handles is great. It hugs the road and is the ultimate road-trip car. The fifth cylinder can really be felt on a steep incline and the cold-weather package has helped me through many a snowy morning! It handles in 6 inches of snow, no problem, and the sunroof makes the summer weather even better! If you are looking for a fun car with a low-maintenance feel and features then this is the car for you! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Body style: people will stop you on the street to ask about the car! Interior features: ample space, stereo sound, heated seats, dash style, trunk space is great. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car is beautiful and performs well in the warm weather. It is much better on fuel than my Jeep Wrangler. It really makes my wife happy and I like that. The problem is that the windows have to open (when the handle is pulled) to open the door. If it gets below 20 degrees, the windows won't open. That means that you can't get in, and if you finally do, you can't close the door or the glass will break. Because of the security VW voids the warranty if you install an aftermarket remote starter and they do not offer one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Doors open and close in warm weather. Wife isn't angry about the car in summer. No paying for additional garage space or storage spring through fall. I do love how it looks and operates when the windows are not frozen.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my car. I previously owned an Explorer, and the two are difficult to compare. The only thing I miss about my Explorer is the storage space, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much can fit in a Beetle. I don't understand why people complain about the gas mileage, I think it's great but then my Explorer did have a V8 engine. Beetles are fun cars to drive, the sound system is great, and it works perfectly as a commuter car.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Don&#039;t get excited</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>A car is supposed to be a reliable transportartion and reliable it is not. Too many trips to the service department, too many recalls, too many service lights coming on worrying me about even more problems. I see likewise frustrated people at the service counter everytime I come in. I'm charged an arm and a leg every time, without a guarantee that the fix will work. A 10 year old KIA has had no problems. I got too excited about aesthetics of it. But the features don't work and have to be repeatedly fixed. If only I read more reviews of long-term owners. Never another VW again. They are nice when on the dealer lot, but in reality too much trouble.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first foreign car and now I get it. This car is quite impressive all around. I love this car. It is comfortable, enjoyable, affordable, even if the gas mileage isn't stellar. It sure beats my old 2006 PT Cruiser which was getting 17 mpg city. You can't help but smile when driving the Beetle. It sticks to the road and is very quick and I feel extremely safe in it even though it is a small car. Don't over think and criticize the back seat. It is more than enough. So the head room isn't excessive, I have had 4 door sedans that were just as bad. Enjoy the ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything. The seats' adjustability, the interior room, the strong driving position, ease of driving, gas mileage, quick throttle response, 5 cylinder torque and horsepower on demand at lower RPMs, fold down seats with removable seat head rests, fits in the garage. I can go on and on.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had the Beetle convertible for about 1 year (not driving it in the winter months). I totally love it. It is fun, reliable and has enough pep for me. I was surprised by the amount of room in the trunk, as I expected virtually nothing. Just really really pleased. I do miss a change holder, as there is no easy place to put a few dollars.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having owned another Beetle and a Jetta before this, I have come to realize that VWs on average have a shelf life of about 4 years, then it's time to trade it in! Despite the frustrations that come with being a VW owner, I keep coming back over and over. Why? The handling - the driving experience. There are so few cars on the market, in my opinion, that combine compactness and great handling. Having driven other compact makes, I find that the Beetle is heavier, handles better, has better features and more road presence. While other compacts feel like they are likely to get blown off the road in a high wind, the Beetle tends to clutch the road and hold its own in snow, rain, etc.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The large shelf dash makes front passengers feel like they have tons of room; steering column is comfortable, long rides are comfortable for front seat passengers. cup holder placement is more comfortable and convenient than past models. Side turn signals remain a plus. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I sold my red 99 Beetle last summer. I was missing it terribly! Last month I bought a new 07, yellow this time. I'm so happy to have a Beetle again. It's easy to park, fun to drive, cleans up nicely and compared to my pick-up truck and Jaguar, economical to keep the tank full. These are cute little cars. I enjoyed my last one and still see it around town. (It's much loved and still looks great.) I know that if the day comes that I must part with this one, it will also find the right person to love it. In the 99 I don't miss the old cup holders or cloth/fabric seats. The 07 has leather, better cup holders and a much needed arm rest. Old one was manual, this one is automatic, no opinion.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the 5-speed, and do enjoy the car's drive and handling. 150HP is plenty in car this size, and I have no complaints about acceleration (Go Bug, Go!). The ABS braking system and anti-skid functions seem to work well. I had several opportunities to drive it in the snow this year, and it seemed to handle that challenge quite well. Though it presents some restrictions, I do appreciate the Bug's styling, as it sets it apart from other cars its size, </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my Red '99 for my new Sunflower yellow (GREAT COLOR) '07. Talk about a GREAT deal! Great price, and they fixed all (but 1) of the features that bothered me in my old beetle. Cup holders were moved, both seats can be raised, and a LOT more power! that extra .5 in the engine REALLY makes a difference. SO FUN TO DRIVE!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow. I have been a Benz and Beemer girl for many years. I wanted a change, and found it with the Beetle. While I love luxury, I like simplicity. I like speed, but not Grand Prix MPH. I want comfort, but not so much that I do not know what to do with it. I love my new Beetle. It is roomier than my former BMW 325i. The trunk is bigger, but configured differently. It runs a little rougher than my old BMW, but we are talking a $20,000 car vs. a $40,000 car. You get what you pay for. The ease of driving and engineering of devices is so easy. BMW and Benz take brain power to figure it all out. VW is simple and, well, simple. The Beetle is comfy, fun, and costs much less money. I love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. It's awesome. I feel safe in the b\Beetle. It's quiet, it comes with an enormous amount of standard features, and for about $20,000, you can get a really decent vehicle. This is my first VW, and I've heard horrible rants about their warranty department, so hopefully everything will go smoothly, and nothing major will go wrong. I've only had the car almost a month, and as of right now, I couldn't be happier! It has a great sound system, great air conditioner, great interior, is extremely comfortable, has beautiful new head-lights, the list goes on.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just recently traded an underpowered 2.0 5-speed manual Beetle for a 2.5 6-speed automatic Beetle. It's even the same color. The new vehicle has significantly more power, better ride, and better build quality. The engine purrs at a quiet 2,200 rpm's at highway speed, making travel much more enjoyable. It has the same great features as my '01 model. This is a good car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The '07 Beetle still lacks the charisma of the old Beetle. So? We should expect more for the more money we pay. How about power seats (sit higher, too), locks, mirrors, a better stereo (MP4), free DVD navigation, cool electronics? Eliminate the pillar and rear blind spots. Give it a better trunk lock. How about the top receding into the boot with an automatic tonneau cover or an power hard top? Give it more power. The handling needs work. It has a firm ride, cut the sponginess. Hey, give it better gas mileage, please! Also, give us attractive mirrors.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks. The ;07 model is better than '06 for the following reasons: the top release doesn't wrench your wrist, it has better steering, faster starts, the engine sounds better (and probably is), it comes in cooler colors, gets better gas mileage, and the knobs and things actually work!</FAVORITE>
