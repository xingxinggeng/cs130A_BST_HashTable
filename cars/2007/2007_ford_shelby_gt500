<TEXT>I love it! It is so smooth and easy to drive that you forget how fast it is until you notice the other traffic disappearing behind you. Despite its power and acceleration it gets better gas mileage than a lot of less capabile cars. The brakes are always strong and I haven't caused them to fade yet. The distinctive good looks and exhust sound cause people to look at you as you cruise through the parking lot. You also get to meet a lot of new people that like cars. It seems that everyone that likes cars is drawn to the GT500. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Distinctive looks, power and brakes. Ok and the attention it gets from passers by.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car. I owned 4 others over the years. This is one great car. I have to be careful because you don't realize your doing 80 or better while tooling along. We took a trip to Vegas in her and she cruised along like a dream. I don't know to say but this little red is a keeper.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>She's a convertible and a six speed manual and built for speed</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned this Shelby since Nov 06. I just love to drive it and hear the whine of the supercharger. I have a cold air kit and tune installed and it really woke up the performance of this car. I've also had it on track in Sebring Florida driver's school. It was a blast to drive.I get 16 MPG in town and 21 HWY at eighty. Had some clutch issues that Ford fixed. So far this is the most fun car I have ever owned. There are plenty of aftermarket parts to dress up your pony car the way you like it. And if you want more power, add a different supercharger.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The motor has a rev limiter, so when you getting on the power don't have to worry about overdoing the RPM. Just love the way the front looks and the supercharger sound. The Shaker 500 rocks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have owned several convertibles - 05 Vette was my last. The Shelby is just more fun. When you mash the pedal to the floor - it just plain hauls. Smokey burnouts at will - and will lay rubber at any speed in 1st gear. The ridgity of the car could be better but it not as bad as some of the expert reviews state. The car lacks some of the bells and whistles of the Vette but who cares if you have to turn the lights on & off. As far as the wow factor goes - its high. Lots of thumbs up and questioning admirers. I think for 10-15K less than the Vette its a steal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style. Power. Exclusivity</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was one of a few owners that had a complete engine failure at 211 miles. It has been the greatest Mustang I have ever owned. I have entered it into 3 shows taking 2 thirds and one first place. It is a real head turner and eats Corvettes!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior design is great. Do not like the decals used for the stripe package, should be painted. Its ride is great, shifts extremely well and the power is supurb!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love the power and all the attention I get with this car. Having the name Shelby just explains it. The ride is quite comfortable for a muslce car. Paid over MSRP with no regrets. Absolutely incredible rush driving it, even at the speed limit. I want to be selfish and not recommend it to you because it will only be more prestigious for us to own. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The front is jaw dropping, be careful it will bite! The option to super snake it to 725+ HP, incredible. Thinking about buying another GT500 to transform into super snake and leaving the 2007 orignal.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I waited for a year, I love it, I rated the reliability high so I hope it lives up to it. I used to own a Boss 302, they don't even compare, the Shelby is fast, and it feels great. The rear suspension could be better, it hops a little on rough roads. The six speed Tremec is smooth shifting, but the clutch is tough. It lets out just a little late for me, hopefully it can be adjusted. Great car, great look. Thank you Carroll, for another great American car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 500 horses under the hood, that great motor.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a very quick car and is very much fun to drive. The car handles well and is good on gas if driven without flooring it. The workmanship is very good. I have not had any problems with mine, just a lot of fun. The car is hard to hook up in first or second gear but different tires could make the difference.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The supercharger is what makes this car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Previosly owned 6-7 Vettes ('73-'95), plus early 70s Formula Firebirds and late 70s Trans Ams. While powerful, only the 73 Corvette 454 big block matched up w/ the Shelby GT 500. Both are breathtaking. The Shelby far outclasses the early-mid 90s Vettes. I traded a 2007 GT/CS for the Shelby. The GT's straight-line performance pales against all of the aforementioned muscle cars. Groused about paying the $10K over sticker premium, but now have zero regrets about price. The Shelby GT 500 is a legitimate $60K ride that is docile until you light the fuse. This is quite simply the best car I've ever owned. If you want your heart to pound the way it did at 21, this is the ticket. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Eye-bulging acceleration. Throttle response. More passing gear than anything on the road. Decisive 6 speed shifter - never miss a shift. Curb appeal, head-turning "wow factor" and exterior aesthetics. Ride comfort. The Shelby GT 500 platform feels more stable than the Mustang GT.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had a great time driving this car. Horsepower is incredible and handling is much better than I expected. Have had no problems so far, gas mileage has been in the high teens - but who cares! A well designed car - good job Ford, another winner in a great Mustang heritage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had my Shelby for over 3 months. The car has 3,000 miles and she has gone to the shop about every 400 miles - blown radiator hose, replace tracking sensor, engine check light, etc. My father bought an Edsel. I believe this car is its reincarnation. Maybe someday I will get the bugs completely worked out of this car. Ford could have done a better job of quality control. This is the one and only Ford I ever intend to own in my lifetime.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very sexy car. This is one car I always dress for when I take her out and about. Heads turn and people talk when I get out. They are reminded of their favorite Mustang experience when they see her and just feel like they have to share their memories!</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Got One!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>If you have one of these beasts, you fall in love with it at first sight and it just gets better after that. Performance is next to none. Comparisons with the Z06 are a joke as this car's collector's status will be here long after the Z06's are in the junk yard. I was literally blown away by the power this thing generates right off the assmbly line. I can't imagine what some after market mod's will do. I was one of the lucky ones who got mine at MSRP, but I can tell you that even at 1$0-15K over, I think it's worth the investment.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great retro-Shelby looks. Unbelievable power, simply scary!Comfortable ride for a sports car. Improved shift linkage over previous Cobra's, It's a Shelby!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the car that only Ford and Carroll Shelby could build. It has the head turning good looks from the mid sixties Shelbys and the refinements of today's suspension and safety features all rolled into a package that is amazing!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, power, and more power. Also, the upgraded seats are very comfortable. You can drive this car for hours and not feel tired. The exhaust note is just right so that it does not drive you nuts after a couple of hours of highway driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Waited 19 months to get this car. This car is one of the fastest cars I have ever driven. I would also like more rumble through the mufflers so I'm in the process of fixing that. The satellite radio is sweet with the 1000 watt Shaker system.The handling is real smooth and the braking is number one! BillyRay says if you get a chance to own a Carroll Shelby land rocket...BUY ONE. Because in 20 years 0 to 60 in 4.5 will still be fast...hold on!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 500HP/auto window feature/1000 watt satellite radio. Neck snapping acceleration. Will be adding more performance options soon, air intake with tune, mufflers, maybe a different SC pulley.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am 53 years old and owned older Mustang muscle cars in the 60's and 70's but nothing like this car. When the TCS system is disengaged, the raw horsepower is frightening. You better be ready for what's about to happen when you step on it. It's hard to drive it and not put your foot in it every time you stop and take off again. I've never ridden on the space shuttle but I can't imagine the rush being any greater!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I choose to order one with no stripes on top or side, and the styling without the stripes makes for an incredibly aggressive car. Mine is black on black stripe delete and looks like it will bite you just sitting in the garage!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this car for a little over msrp. I have been lucky enough to own several true sports cars in my life from all the major brands. This car is a blast from 0 to 60. But when the new wears off, the interior looks just like Mustang GT and the build quality is not what it should be. I think the Shelby team should have spent a little more time on the interior and fit and finish to make this a 10 out of 10. Also Ford dealers are trying to charge way to much over msrp for this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I paid msrp for my Vista Blue GT500. It was worth if. I have a SVT Cobra and didn't buy this car because of the Shelby name. I have always want to see what a SC 4V 5.4l would do in a Mustang. My car will not be a garage queen. I picked my car up in MI and drove it 1600 miles back to FL in 19 hours. Only gripe was the car is to quiet. Didn't sound like a Mustang should. Very fun; can't wait until more parts come out and we start seeing the GT500 putting down 500-600 rwhp.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Supercharged 4V 5.4l, and the solid rear - love it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I ordered mine in June and just received it last week. When I first saw this two years ago in New York I knew I had to have one. It is everything I hoped it would be and more. Can not fully explain feeling I had when I saw it for the very first time on the back of the car carrier that brought her to dealership. The acceleration that this car has is probably comparable to being on the space shuttle. It pushes you back into your seat and you remain there until you let up. I have yet to fully open her up. It drives so smooth, takes corners with precision, accelerates quickly and effortlessly. Driving it on smooth roads at 80mph feels like 40mph. Always wanted to own a Shelby, dream come true. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration, body style, stereo, wrap around comfortable seating, quality painting, everything that this car offers is first rate.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First for the naysayers I put on just a few miles then went straight to the chassis dyno. How does 460+hp & 445lb ft of tq @ rear wheels sound? That's PURE stock, not a single change from stock. Same dyno a very healthy 426 Hemi made 310hp @ wheels; that's 150+ rwhp over a HEMI! Nothing short of incredible overall. I would take this car over 2 Z06's. Fit & finish is SUPERB! Paint is the nicest I have ever seen on an American car & I am a body man/painter. Not a single complaint. Minor mods put these cars in the 10's in 1/4 mile. Braking & handling are also nothing short of incredible. 60-0 110ft. A very nice chassis with too many changes over standard Mustang GT to mention. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine and transmission are incredibly smooth, the tall 3:31 gearing and wide powerband makes it a true rocket ship that pulls from off idle to 6250 limiter. 1/4 in low 12's @ 118.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Wait for price drop</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I traded in my Z06 for this car and paid way over sticker. Thought at the time I had to have it. Shame on Ford for letting dealers charge way more than msrp for the car. That's what is wrong with Ford and why no one wants to get ripped off by them. Save some money and get a Vette or wait for the price to drop.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The hp is unreal, great straight line speed. Looks are great also.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Upon hearing the hp rating and performance numbers I expected this car to ride slightly better than a go-kart. I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth the ride was and the "tameness" of 500 horses with normal driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I paid quite a bit over sticker for this baby... nice car, but for the price, well... There's nothing wrong with the car itself. It's a great car, just pricey. It drives nicely, a bit front-heavy, but its straight-line performance is amazing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hmm? Maybe the 500hp V8 under the hood? Yeah. Probably.</FAVORITE>
