<TEXT>I just had a BMW x5 and I just hated not having a third row seat and had 3 kids and had a lot of play dates! When my lease was up I could not wait to get a new car. I was looking at the Highlander and didn't like it as much as the Sequoia. I got just a couple of weeks ago and now I love to get out of the house! I love the second row captain chairs and removable center console. I think I should never get a new car again because I bought mine! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Third row window comes down, bucket seats in second row, nav. system, heated front seats, I got to admit everything about the Sequoia I like!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Sequoia is an excellent SUV. Reliability has been great. At 25,000 miles repair of the tension control for the fan belt was required, up to 38,500 now and no other repairs. Like the looks of the 2007 better than the new style. Would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for an SUV that is big and holds a lot of stuff. Even got a full/queen size headboard in the back. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DVD system with headphones. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my Sequoia for a little over two years now and though I love driving the vehicle and it works well for my family of five, I am 15,000 miles past my manufacturer's warranty and already have over $2,000.00 in repairs. I was lucky enough to have purchased the extended warranty so I haven't had to pay for these repairs out of pocket but I am very worried about what this vehicle is going to cost me in the long run. I am pretty sure I will dump it when it is paid for. This is a shame because I really like the vehicle from a users point of view. My last issue was with the fuel pump at 45,000 miles. The part alone is over $600.00 from the dealership. That excludes labor. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plenty of room. Interior works well for my family. Comfortable to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the most practical and stylish vehicle I have owned. I refuse to drive a mini van; this was well worth the increased price. I can comfortably haul five kids for hours having them watch the big screen DVD in comfort. It is easy to drive and not expensive to maintain.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DVD, leather & heated seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only had this vehicle for 2000 miles but so far I am pleased. It rides a little tougher than I'd hoped (on a smooth road it's great but where are those) but it doesn't jar your teeth loose and it's taut and quiet. The 08 fixed all my gripes about this model except the price, I couldn't justify another 25K for fold down seats and that wonderful 5.7L in the 08. Drive 65 for 500 mi, you'll be surprised (pleasantly). Having a trained ear, the JBL is simply not worth the money to me, but for R&R I'm sure it's just fine.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like looking at it and the drivers seat is very comfortable. Utilitarian wise it suits my needs.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am very disappointed in the engineering / design ergometrics of my 2007 Sequoia Limited. The console controls are not lighted (side mirrors, seat heater) and in a poor location because the seat heaters can be turned on by laying an item across the console. No dash indicator light for fog lights. The gas mileage is poor (16 mpg highway and 14 around town). Rear storage compartment won't stay latched. Second seats will stay folded up (must restrain with a tether). I have factory nav system and satellite radio not available. Limited slip differential doesn't lock (engaging TRAC OFF seems to help but that doesn't make sense). I wish I had my Chevy Tahoe back!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a Toyota for their supposed great customer satisfaction and reliability. I must say that this not what I have experienced. The car does start and run just fine. The problem lies in all the little things going wrong and the number of times that dealer visits are required. So far both mirrors have gone loose. The clock has failed, the rear hatch won't stay open, the power outlets have failed ... the list goes on. On top of that, the dealer and Toyota Corporate are great at stating that not all problems can be fixed under warranty even though the warranty has not expired. I still have 18 months left on the warranty and 10k miles to go. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth ride, always runs</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 2007 Sequoia is a great vehicle for a family with too much stuff. Ample storage room, comfortable seats. No issues over the first 10K miles. Great build quality, fairly quiet interior. Tires seem to wear well. Have avgd around 20 miles/gallon on hwy. Around 15 city. Overall great looks, fun to drive. Much better value compared to the 2008s. Would buy again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning a 4Runner for the past 6 years, we needed a bit more room (we travel with show dogs to dog shows and needed the space for crates), we upgraded to the Sequoia. I wanted the '07 version since I like the body style better than the '08s. I love the vehicle but it does ride louder and a bit "rougher" than my '07 4Runner. This vehicle is WAY too big not to have a backup camera, so we are having that added immediately. I also like the a/c and heater controls more than in my 4Runner. LOVE the universal remote to open my garage and don't know how I ever lived without the heated seats! I really overall love this car and expect to still be driving it in 10 years!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Arctic Frost Pearl paint (BEAUTIFUL and unique color), NAV system (which I think works fine despite the other reivews here to the contrary), heated seats, rear DVD, moonroof (however, 4Runner adjusted to avoid windthrob and Seq one does not), universal remote garage door opener, remote ignition.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As a confirmed Toyota hater, I was surprised at how much I liked this vehicle. Not sure how long I will keep it. I wanted a diesel Mercedes. I did not like the MB 7 speed transmission. This is MUCH smoother and less intrusive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance, ride and comfort. It is so much smoother riding than my 05 GMC on our crappy freeways. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this vehicle for 6 mos now and just love it! Comfortable and great tow vehicle for our midsize boat. Better gas mileage than most other large SUVs. Engine is both smooth and full of torque. I have the pkg that has the rear captain chairs and would recommend this seating unless you have 5 kids.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stereo is good as it is a JBL. Transmission shifts smoothly and exterior design is appealing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had my mind set on the new GL320 CDI Mercedes. I test drove it and did not like the 7 speed transmission. On a fluke I drove the Sequoia. I really do not like Toyota. I do like this SUV. It is not a diesel that I wanted but it is a very nice ride. On a trip to AZ I was not at all tired after 5 straight hours behind the wheel. I would recommend it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride, comfort, smooth engine and transmission response. Good seats compared to many new luxury SUVs. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Love it!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Love this car! What a great car for our long road trips and also all the in town day to day driving too. Nav and the DVD are great and a must have. The third seat comes in handy for extra family in town and can fold up or be taken out easily. The 2nd row bucket seats that recline with very large console is very nice and our teenager loves it. We will have this car for many years to come. We get 14.3 mpg in town.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation!! 3rd seat when needed, radio controls on steering wheel, DVD that we can connect game systems to for long trips, outlets in car just like home for anything.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle is really fabulous. I have been a life long owner of Acura/Honda vehicles and now am extremely happy with my new purchase of a 2007 Toyota Sequoia Ltd. in June 2007. I've had many knee operations and this vehicle provides me with ample leg room while all of my previous vehicles did not. Everything about this Sequoia is really perfect. And regarding the fuel mileage, I average 15.4 miles per gallon and that is almost as good as I was getting with the Acura MDX. If you are in need of a safe, heavy, roomy, and reliable SUV this is your one! My daughter convinced me to buy the Sequoia and it was a great move. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased this SUV after owning a Durango for 8 years and what a difference! Smooth ride, lots of room, especially with two kids. We bought the luxury package and love the second row captains chairs and the center console. The kids can keep all of their things (videos, head phones, games, etc.) all in one place. I splurged and got a wood-wrapped steering wheel, which makes the car feel like a luxury vehicle. And I second the vote on Artic Frost Pearl, best color ever! It is very pretty!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were in the market this year for a larger SUV expecting our second child, and looked at everything on the market to be fair. It came down to the Expedition and the Sequoia. The Sequoia is by far the best full size SUV you can get for the money. We were also able to get ours at an exceptional value, considering Toyota is cleaning the lots this time of year. Perfect for a two baby/child family. Decent on gas, and the ride is as smooth as most cars. We couldn't be happier and are officially a Toyota family. We bought a black SR5 with appearance package, tan interior, sunroof, towing package. It is a sharp SUV and we are looking forward to taking it on our first road trip soon.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powerful and smooth engine. Child latch in the third row. Huge sunroof. Front and back A/C. Loads of room inside. General looks of the vehicle. Toyota reliability and fit and finish.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've always been a skeptic about the performance of our Toyota Sequoia, but after a recent car accident I can't imagine a safer car. My sister recently endured a traumatic car crash with our Sequoia flying 10 feet in the air and flipping three times and she came out shaken but nearly unscathed. The Toyota Sequoia is built like a tank and guarantees both the satisfaction of a SUV and a safe vehicle. It's quite literally a life saver.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Our sound system and navigational system was absolutely amazing!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Sequoia is one of the best SUVs we have owned or test driven. It's a great vehicle and one of the smoothest rides. It's also a great looking car. The color of our Sequoia is Arctic Frost and it is one of the most beautiful colors ever. It's a creamy white with an irridescent pearl flakes in it. We had the headrest DVDs put in for our boys and they can both either watch the same or different movie or connect their gamecube. It's great for long trips. I will definitely keep the Sequoia in our family. We have gone from being Ford drivers to Toyota. Our next Toyota will be a Tundra for my husband.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the color of our car... Arctic Frost!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had this SUV since 2001 when they first came out. Have 116,000 miles on her. Hope for another 116,000. Great styling. Now I see so many of them on the road. Can't wait to see the new styling. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I decided to test drive a Sequoia... I took it home an hour later. This is an extremely quiet and smooth ride. Solid workmanship makes this the ultimate in style, comfort and an all around SUV that remains timeless. Well done Toyota, I'll be back for another one if this ever goes out. I currently have 93k on it, runs like a brand new Sequoia.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet ride, VSC/TRAC, smooth shifting, rear window rolls down, great stock stereo system, ergonomic cluster layout.</FAVORITE>
