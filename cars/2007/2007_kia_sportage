<TEXT>Purchased this vehicle 9 months ago for my 100 mile round trip commute. Gas mileage has been better than expected 25-28 mpg. Interior is good size for my 6'4 300lb frame. Power is okay. Not going to win races, but does fine for my commute. Put almost 20000 mile on it so far and had no problems. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>interior space, room for cargo, easy to manuver in tight areas.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got this back in March 09. I like it a lot. The biggestthing is safety. The gas mileage is ok. Also got it for 4- wheel drive to deal with snow/ice and driving country backroads. Got a good deal so other people might too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought a used Kia Sportage with 35000 miles .. it sits better and feels better than any of its competition .. i.e. Rav4, CRV, Nissan Rouge, Ford .. I drove all of those and decided the Rav4 was best for me .. then I drove the Kia .. my only complaint .. fuel economy and smaller engine .. but my Kia stays up with the best of them on the highway!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had it 18 months and have 25,000 miles on it. Never had one problem with it. Very dependable and thinking about buying a Sorento just for more room. My husband is 6' 3" and is very comfortable driving it and riding in it. It is not 4WD and in the snow I put the ESC on and it drives well in snow. No complaints!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was nicely surprised at the options that came on my Sportage... the leather package, heater seats, etc. I've ridden in Honda CRVs where you feel a dime when you run over it. Not this vehicle. The ride is very smooth in-town and on an interstate. I am extremely happy with this purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The comfort level is much more than I expected. As for EPA estimates, I get better mpg than what the sticker said.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After having my first accident with another type of car, I was particularly interested in a safe vehicle while still trying not to go over budget. I finally decided on a Kia Sportage and I think I made one of the best choices in a car that I have ever made. It has a 5 star rating, and it was not bad on my budget while I feel that I got a decent small SUV with a good warranty for my money. It has averaged about 22-23 mpg overall, but that is not bad compared to other SUV's on the market at the moment. I have three other family members who are buying Kia's now, although they all opted for the Amanti. My little SUV handles great and I drive an avg of 700 miles per week.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Small but yet still has room for my family. I like the way it handles. I also like having 6 air bags surrounding me in the event that I ever need them. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased this for my wife. We looked at the CR-V, but it was not available with a V6. Also, was about 10K more when compared to our fully loaded KIA. Also, the KIA has a better warranty. This car is excellent for the price. The 4X4 w/ESC and TRAC is GREAT in the snow and ice. Leather heated seats & remote start are nice and a must for cold weather users. Not impressed with the gas mileage. We have yet to see better then 18.5 MPG in the city. (About 17 in the winter.) I was never a fan of KIA before I purchased this, but so far, I have been impressed. I would purchase again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched several small suvs and decided on the Sportage. It is very nimble in curvy mountain driving, and excellent in climbing grades with the alternate manual shift feature. It gets excellent mileage for a 6 cylinder car (20 around town; 25 on the highway at 70 mph), and cruises well on long distance drives. While there is some road noise on some road surfaces, it is not a major problem. I recently had to move quite a few large boxes and was able to accommodate them in the vehicle with all but the driver's seat laid flat. A nice feature.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lay flat seats, including the front passenger seat. Easy access to all controls. The manual shift option for hill climbs and descents. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been overall impressed with my Kia Sportage. However, the gas mileage is the biggest issue. In addition, after 24,000 miles I had to replace the Bridgestone tires. Furthermore, the transmission shifts roughly sometimes when you need it going up hills, or trying to pass. The cooling fan sometimes sound like there is a knocking in the engine. I travel on avg. 1000-1200 miles per week with the kia and it handles very well and the ride is smooth for a SUV. Arthur</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the size of the Kia and the room is provides inside. In addition, I enjoy the stereo which is high quality.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> I like the Kia Sportage. I traded in my 2005 Kia Spectra and got this Sportage. I liked my Spectra but wanted something higher profiled.
Gas mileage is quite a bit lower than my Spectra but knew it would be.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We leased our Sportage in Feb. 2007 mainly because we wanted to test the vehicle prior to actually buying one for the long term. The 4 banger is a little weak when it comes to hills. But on flat land it is just fine. Mileage is about 20/21 mpg in the city and 23/25 highway. Overall the quality of the vehicle is superb for a cheapy.This vehicle is very well made. Quality parts and hardware through out. The bottom line is I will buy one once our lease expires. But I'll get the V-6 instead of the I4. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just drove our new Kia Sportage home yesterday. We owned an SUV prior to this purchase, but unfortunately it got totaled when I hit a patch of ice last week. After being used to driving an SUV (we had a mini-van prior to that) I don't like the feel of a car, so we test drove the Kia Sportage and the Rav 4. Both performed well, but when it came to price the Kia won. Almost bought a Kia several years ago but didn't like the way they drove. The 2007 model has greatly improved Kia's performance and reliablity tests.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked at a bunch of different SUVs. Kia really has the market on more bang for your buck, friends told me to buy a Honda CR-V but I bought a KIA Sportage and I'm laughing all the way to the bank with the money I saved, the standard up grades on the Sportage you pay for on other SUVs, would highly recomend this to everyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our Sportage EX new, has every available option. We had a full size SUV before this. We were surprised at the interior room and comfort. Easy to get in and out. Handles great, especially in the snow and ice, we had a lot this year. I saw jeeps and subarus crashed into ditches and sign posts but our sportage kept on going. It's a little luxury SUV at a reasonable price. Great car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated leather seats, remote start is great in snow and cold! Love the fold flat seats and locking 4wd. Sunroof is nice too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My aging Blazer needed replacement. I did a lot of research before buying a small SUV. Initially, Kia was not on my list. My perceptions were based on the 90's cheap built Kia that mechanics discouraged buying. A happenstance visit to a Kia dealer changed all that. One week later I returned to purchase my Silver EX Luxury Edition Sportage. Why? Styling, bang for my $$, fuel economy and standard features found only as options on similar vehicles. I'm not disappointed. The interior is plush and the exterior is eye-catching. The engine/transmission is what I expected and want - a nice balance between power and fuel economy. Summary - you won't be sorry. Believe me, I'm particular!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Kia Sportage is a very good car for the price it is worth. I was going to buy a ford edge but instead I got the Kia Sportage. So far the car has been doing well; the fuel economy is great - 22 in the city and 27 in the highway. There is one problem when the highway you hear the road too much but everything else is great. I recommend it for a family of 4 or 5. The trunk space is really good and the seats fold flat to make the trunk bigger. It is a great car, looks kind of sporty andhas a nice touch to it. It could use more power but that's ok.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the EX 4wd with every available option Feels safe when driving, heated leather seats feel good on cool days, power sunroof is nice. Takes corners good, mileage better that some 4wd, but always could be better, we average 22 hwy/city driving. Love the rubber tray in cargo area, easy to clean, reclining rear seats are a hit, grocery bag net in back is sweet, leather nice but not the finest grade. The cost is about what you would pay for a used SUV but you get the 10 year 100,000 mile warranty. Good stuff. Back seat has lots of leg room, I'm 6'3" and don't mind sitting there. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated leather seats are sweet. The satin silver paint is nice, deep looking color. The ESC keeps you on the road. Love the power sunroof. Leg room great in front and back.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really like all of the neat features that come standard with the vehicle. For example, something as small as the shopping bag hooks in the back are very female-friendly for all those female shoppers out there like myself.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the exterior shape of the vehicle because it is similar to the CR-V but much more affordable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I thought I could love this small SUV but after trading in my 06 Trailblazer for it in an effort to get better gas mileage (was only getting 13 mpg in the Trailblazer), I'm sorely disappointed that I'm only getting 18-19 mpg (mostly city driver). Fairly comfortable for around town, horrible on hills... don't even think about taking it on mountain roads like we did - it was exhausting. Definitely lacks pickup and refinement.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Flat-folding rear seats - very easy to flip down. Also like that they're plastic on the back (the Trailblazer was carpeted and got quite messy).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I saw a Sorento last year and wanted it but when I saw the Sportage I was sold just on the outside looks and size. Now that I own one, I see that it's a real sleeper. It has great speed and handling; it's the SUV that thinks it's a sports car, or I drive it like one. I feel very safe when I'm driving. It's quiet when the doors are closed to road noise. It's the first luxury car/truck I've ever owned. I keep finding small key extras. With the 10yr/10k, 5yr roadside, 3yr paint, I'll have this one a long time to come and I'm loving it. I've dressed up my truck and get looks all the time. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Size, performance, style, quality and the support from Kia. Rear glass open for quick load of small packages. Great turning radius; it turns like my Accent which is another Korean made automobile. I did not choose these automobiles, they chose me.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Economy not what I expected. Handles good, rides good. Engine has plenty of pep. Big problem with noise from suspension sounds like shocks or shock bushings. Dealer checked twice, still same noise. Dealer says all Sportages have same noise. No more Kia Sportages for me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>You get a lot of bang for the buck with this vehicle. I drive gently on flat roads in southeast Michigan and get about 23.5 MPG with the four cylinder automatic. Most of my commute is on surface streets so I'm very pleased with the mileage. Cargo capacity if very good for this size vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What amazes me most is how quiet the interior is and how well the Sportage rides on rough roads. I am 6 ft tall and have ample legroom. When you slam the doors they sound solid. There is definitely quality put into this low cost vehicle not to mention the security or the great warranty.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are the flip up rear window which is standard and the sensible cup holders.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We usually buy a two year old vehicle and my last one was a Ford Explorer. Decided this time that for about the same money I could have a new Sportage. Very satisfied with my decision, nice size and good comfort and the quality seems to be fine but time will tell. Gas milage is as advertised plus a little more.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased new Sportage 2 weeks ago and love the smooth ride and handling. Ride is very quiet on smooth roads but bumps tend to transfer noise through tires and chassis. Not as roomy as my Sorento I had for four years, but gas mileage is better and maneuverability as well. Overall, can't beat the price considering the features, and the 10 year 10,000 drive train warranty. </TEXT>
