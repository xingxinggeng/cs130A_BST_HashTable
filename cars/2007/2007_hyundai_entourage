<TEXT>The van looks good and drives nice but don't let that fool you! The fuel economy is no were near what we were told. The brakes are a disaster and needed replacing after only 35000 km rotors and all. The idler failed after 50000 km. Had to be towed for a computer failure. the latches on the side doors fail. if you open the driver's door in the rain, you will not be able to close the gas cap door. There are problems with the wiring in the back door. there are always light on the dash that shouldn't be on , last being a problem with the air bags!! If you don't live next to the dealer ship or want to keep the van past it's warranty, don't buy it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, Drive-ability(when it's running safely), the electric side doors(also when they work)and the interior comfort.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have an 2007 Entourage and wish we could get rid of it, the A/C clunks when you first start the engine, something a $28,000.00 new van should not do. After replacing the A/C twice, Hyundai finally said that was normal in all Entourage's, so live with it, and we found that when the Rep from Hyundai in California makes a decision, that's as far as it goes. Great company policy, if I were to lose my job, they would take it back, but have a serious problem with their product and it's tough! I have a 2006 KIA(sister company) Sorento with 17,000 more miles on it then the Entourage, and the KIA rides, drives and sounds better then the Hyundai. Did I mention it sounds like a tank when cold.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>ESC, it doen't drive like a mini van, can't understand why this isn't standard on all cars, trucks, and vans.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned the vehicle for 2 1/2 years & have over 64,000 miles; the only problem I ever had was the sliding doors getting jammed; we just had them repaired (nationwide problem we were told) never had any other problems; dealership has great service; they remember me by name when I go in for service (oil changes regularly); the only thing I don't care for is the resale value; there is none; depreciates too quickly </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the rear backing sensors & how the vehicle handles on the road; very trustworthy</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my 2007 Entourage in Spring of 2007. Automatic sliding doors have not worked properly since I bought it. Every time I bring it in for service I am told that nothing is wrong with the doors. Only other problem is the gas mileage averages about 17 MPG - not what I had expected. I want to get rid of it so bad - but the value has dropped so much - i can't get rid of it!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned this van for over a year now, and have not had any problems at all with it. I purchased it used with 20k miles, and I've since put on 10k, mostly on the highway. The van is large and spacious, similar to Odyssey, Sienna and Caravan (I've driven all of these). The performance is very good considering it's size, and you have to remember that it's a minivan, not a sports car. I think the build quality is good, not quite up to Sienna or Odyssey levels, but on par with the Caravan. The 5 year 60k mile warranty is a reassuring factor, but I have not yet had to take advantage of it. Also, I think gas mileage is pretty good, I get about 26 mpg on the highway, with a moderate load.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fold down rear seats. Good standard features (separate climate controls for driver, passenger, and rear), functional front and center consoles, easy control features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought used in Dec. 06 with 11000 miles. It was Factory Reps vehicle. Was sold on Hyundai because of previous experience with Elantra and Sonata. This van has had 22 warranty claims since bought. The van is very competitive with Toyota and Honda in design and function just not in the owner satisfaction category. I feel that the biggest issue with this van in the dealerships service. Hyundai dealers remind me of the Domestic dealers from the past big on selling just not on service. You should not have to continuously take a vehicle in for the same issue and be told we don't know whats wrong with it sorry about your luck. They have fixed everything except the whine in right rear speaker. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Its not good to say that I was cheap because I just happen to get my money's worth paying less which is 10,000 to 15,000 dollars compared to Toyota Sienna or Honda Odyssey. We bought and wasted 31,000 dollars for this PIECE OF JUNK. After sales service is WORST. They always advertise how great their warranty is, but, its just an advertisement. Auto sliding doors are always jammed. Instrumentation panel is not reliable. Cruise control does not work properly. Sharp edge on the steering wheel.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Although, I have not been to any accident, I just hope the air bags (rear side curtains, front and side) would work because honestly when I bought this vehicle - SAFETY was the top priority.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> We got our Entourage when it first came out cause we love hyundai cars, and needed a bigger family vehicle. We loved this vehicle until we started having major issues with it. We have already had to have the entire electrical system of the van replaced after only having it 11/2 yrs and it needs to be replaced again. Our power doors are a nightmare. They close then open right back up. When they actually do close the track keeps going even after the door is closed. When we pull on the door handles to open the doors they don't open. With in the last 9 months our van has been in the shop over 8 times, for the same things over and over again.Now i understand why you need the warranty they offer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love that the safety features come standard, which they should in any vehicle you purchase. Love how our family of 5 fits along with our great dane and our pit bull, along with all our bags. Can haul alot of big items inside as well. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We paid for the extended warranty and glad that we did! Brakes started squealing within the first six months, tires did not last as long as they should have, battery died after about 50000 miles. They have had to change the air compressor, the fuel sensor, and a few other parts. We have had to get it towed twice. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought van 2 years ago and it has been in the shop 11 times. 3 new batteries, 2 new oxygen sensors, 2 tension pulleys.....it just goes on and on. 25,000 miles and the Michelins wouldn't pass inspection they were so bald. Brakes were starting to squeal. Decided to trade and even with rebates etc we lost 5 grand! It was losing $1000 in kelly blue book every month. Do not buy this van you will regret it and be so far in debt on it you can't get out!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very comfortable ride and drivablility. My wife and myself have lower back problems which make access and egress from a car a problem, especially after driving for a couple of hours. With the van everything is so much easier and our back problems are almost nil. We travel on trips up to 500 miles and enjoy the space and the powered doors and hatch. We now have 5200 miles on the van and have not had any signifcant problems. The fit and quality of everything is excellent. We researched the van market before buying and this is by far the best van on the market and at least 10K less than the nearest competitor(Honda Odessy). Safety features was also parmount in our decision to buy this van.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just an update after owning the Entourage SE for 6 months now. The only problem that we are having is that the check engine light comes on periodicaly. The owners manual says to check the tightness of the gas cap. So when it comes on, usually at about a half tank, I get out and unscrew the cap and retighten. Then by the next morning, the lights off. Some day I'll get my butt in gear and get it to the dealer. But other than that, the van has been nothing but fantastic. The kids love the DVD and the fact that the windows on the sliding doors go up and down. The wife loves the heated seats now that winter is coming and I love the horse power and smooth ride and the back up warning sensor.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE> Standard traction and stability control. The 13 speaker sound system with 6 disc cd and dvd with surround sound. Power sliding side doors with operable windows.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased the Limited w/ent pkg on 9/30/06. We took delivery with 257 miles and immediately noticed a transmission issue with engine braking when removing foot from the gas. We test drove 3 others on the dealer's lot and none of them did this. Ours engine brakes until it hits idle speed and then the transmission finally releases from the engine allowing it to coast. We immediately reported this to the dealer. It has been in for this 3 times. They have re-programmed the transmission and still no fix. Now going on 7 weeks and 2200 miles and still not fixed. Hyundai DM due in Monday to 'evaluate'. Wish we would have waited for the 2007 Toyota Sienna! I'll add followup after Monday</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Electroluminescent dash is awesome. Great Infinity system. Power rear liftgate, again awesome. Heated leather seats (Wisconsin). Rear folding seats are excellent. Plenty of engine power. Overall, we would love this van if it weren't for the engine/transmission issue! We just want it fixed!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We ordered our van and it's been down hill every since. The van is beautiful inside and out, with many extras. Unfortunately we also have a van that engine brakes everytime we take our foot off of the gas. We brought it back 2 days after purchasing and 7 weeks later we are still getting the run around. This is my first new vehicle and I am terribly disappointed with this. The service manager and the district manager are making us wait further so that he can test drive the van. This problem is evident with just the feel of the vehicle and also is visible on the tach... the transmission is not releasing. Poor service!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Only had it for a short time and have had no problems. The Limited Edition is the way to go. Nice acceleration, nice brakes, firm drive, and excellent value. Seriously considered Honda until I came accross this car. Nice features only available on top of the line Honda. Able to program remote to automatically adjust the seat, side view mirror, and brake/gas pedal but not as useful since we typically use one remote between the two of us. No navigational system offered but nice external, portable ones available on the market.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power doors and liftgate. Infinity speakers and surround sound. Power adjustable brake and gas pedal. Powered side rear windows. Powered sunroof. Wireless headphones. Video input right next to 12V outlet allows for external gaming systems to be played on the monitor with V converter. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have 3 small kids and resisted buying a minivan for years. We drove all vans on the market and found this to be the best value and safest out there. It is solidly built and the styling is unique and still nice to look at. It is easy to move around inside and super comfortable to both ride in and drive. We have driven it 10K miles in 3 months of VT weather and have no complaints. We own a Hyundai Santa Fe and look forward to driving the Entourage in the snow to see how it compares. The Kia Sedona is a near twin, but the Entourage is simply nicer to look at both inside and out.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort and layout - I can buckle my toddlers in the back with no trouble! I also love the traction and stability control - both standard. After the tire warning light came on (another standard feature), I love it too. It saved me from a certain blowout when a nail was found diagonally in my sidewall!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my Toyota Sienna for the Entourage. I thought I'd end up with a Honda, but the Entourage offered better amenities at a better price. I don't generally but a car in the first model year, but the build quality seems excellent and I have had no problems. Engine has punch, brakes are excellent, safety features top drawer. I have no regrets.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have to say that I was impressed with my Hyundai when I was rear ended on my way to work one morning. I had only had my van for three months. I was stopped for traffic at a red light. The other car was traveling around 45 mph when it hit me. His car was totaled and mine just had a scuffed and torn up bumper, which also destroyed all the electical equipment installed in the bumper for the back-up system. I was very impressed with the slight amound of damage to my vehicle as safety was a big feature for me when I purchased the Hyundai. It certainly exceded my expectations.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like all the features on my vehicle and it would be very hard to try to narrow it down to one favorite feature. I am very pleased with all the electronic doors that open either with the key pad or just a tug on the door, but that is a feature on most new vans.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> controI have had this van in two dealerships and a total of five vists and had to drive over 500 miles of the 3000 miles and been without the van for over a week while it was repaired. It has needed a radiator replacement and numerous other leaks in the heating system. This van has been towed twice and driven back 3 times for the leaks. I contacted Hyundai consumer assistane and basically was told they would help the dealership fix the vehicle but did not offer any replacement. I feel this van should be yellow instead of red. When it runs this is very great van.</TEXT>

<TEXT>At first (I'll admit) I had my doubts buying a Hyundai over a Toyota or a Honda, but after driving the Entourage all summer long and putting over 2,500 miles on it...I am now a true believer! There are so many positive things to be said about this car I don't know where to begin. My favorite I guess is the 245 horses that powered our family up some of the steepest mountains this summer. The Five Star Crash Ratings is ALWAYS nice to have, and the traction and stability control made us feel safe in heavy rain storms. The interior feels luxurious, and the driver's side ergonomics is exceptional. My kids love it, my wife loves it... and above all, its made right here in the USA!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning 4 toyotas, this was a big move. The outside appearance of this van is superior to all others. The inside is also superior. I have been disappointed in the gas mileage though. I have only been averaging 16 - 17 mpg during the summer months. Should the air conditioning make that much difference? I don't think so. 19 mpg would be o.k. The van does seem to surge a lot. I only have 3000 miles on my van so hopefully it will start getting better mileage very soon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought it on the 6th of June, returned it same day. Wheel shook out of hand. Sent to tire shop. Balanced tires. All were out. Steering wheel still vibrated. Dealer over the next 2 months tried, as directed by Hyundai; balancing 4 times; new tires; checking axle balance no problems. Hyundai rep said "...normal characteristic". Then Dealer's mechanic found excessive play in HUB. Installed new hub(bearing assembly) passenger side. Shaking stopped for 10 days then began again, drives. Tried tightening bolt on hub and polishing rotor with no positive results. Now they are supposed to replace Drivers side hub. Filed a LEMON LAW Claim against Hyundai. Dealer has had vehicle for 45 days.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After a year of research, we purchase this van in late June. I am thrilled with my decision! What solidified my decision to purchase this van was the crash-test ratings from iihs.org. Finally, an automaker made a van I had real confidence in. After looking at the Kia Sedona, we decided on the Entourage simply because of its sporty look- I preferred the brushed metal to the cheesy looking faux wood. We bought the LIMITED edition with the sunroof package; ours came with floormats. This van is a dream to drive, the fit and finish are top-notch, and I look even smarter because I saved a bundle! I am little disappointed with gas mileage (15 MPG vs 18), but my daughter is safe, so it's forgivable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We own the 2006 Kia Sedona, fully loaded. My friend just got a loaded Entorage from his company. They are the same in most every way. We sort of prefer the looks of the Sedona, but we have a better color. ALL of these vans look alike. But these new Korean models blast Honda and Toyota with equal or better quality, features and luxury. I'm still shocked after putting 5K on the Sedona. You simply can't go wrong. One reviewer noted a handling difference in the two vans. We give a slight edge to the Sedona, but the Enetourage seemed a bit nicer on the bumps. Too close to bother with. Get either and be happy!

<TEXT>This van is very much worth a test drive. Most of the standard features are options on other vans or you can't get them. Standard traction control, standard stability control, power sliding side doors. Was only looking for the base SE model but with the owner loyality rebate. We got a SE with the PE package and its been nothing short of awesome. Rear DVD,6 disc cd with 13 speakers, with surround sound. Heated front seats. We returned a 01 town & country on a lease. The sticker price between them was $1890.00. All it had was air, power windows, antilock brakes and cassette. Didn't even consider Honda or Toyota. They can't match the warranty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, like most everyone else our family grew and so did our needs. Shopping the big three minivans GM,Chrysler, Ford, and Toyota, Honda, and Hyundai, we choose the Hyundai. The price, $10-$15K less than the rest, the safety, by the nhitsa and the iihsta reports, and of course the the over all fit/finish. The domestics were not even in the same league of the others, especially in fit and finish. When it came down to the others the price and warantee were the biggest deterrents. If they are willing to sell a $40K van, then it should have a warantee that reflects the true value of their product. Otherwise, price accordingly. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>That safety is not an option in these vehicles. Sure the stereo,and all the other bells an whistles are great. But honestly, they should be when we're talking about my hard earned money. I do like the multi positional arm rests</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We NEVER thought that we would buy a Hyundai. We decided to look at this one originally because of the warranty and all of the problems we were having with our then-current minivan. After driving the Entourage all we could say was WOW!, and were do we sign. We bought an SE with every option except leather. The build quality, seating, standard features, optional features, ergonomics, ride and drive, and anything else related to a vehicle are as close to perfect as you can get. Anyone looking to buy a van will be doing themselves a huge injustice if they don't drive a Entourage before making a purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the Limited trim with the ultra package. The van drives beautifully. It is easy to handle and has lot of amenities. However, I am very unhappy about the gas mileage. I have not been able to get over 13 miles to the gallon even on short highway trip where speed was up to 55 mph. This is considerably less than the 18/24 miles advertised.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Couldn't be happier with our decision to purchase an Entorage Limited edition. Traded a Ford Windstar SEL in that we had for about 60,000 miles. There is no comparrison the Entorage beats it in every way. Gas mileage is about 25% better. The comfort in this vehicle is unbelievable. Great power! Workmanship is fantastic.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>There are so many features that both my wife and I love it's hard to pick out the favorites. The multiple climate controls for driver, passenger and rear makes everyone comfortable, along with the heated seat. The DVD has great quality. With all the options it hard to name them all.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I researched mini vans for nearly a year before purchasing our Entourage last week. We had settled on a Sedona, but when the Entourage became available a few weeks ago we loved the sportier look, the chrome, the whole package. We went with the Limited to get the options we wanted. After all my research, I can say we got the best deal of them all. More room, more saftey, more power, better sound, head and shoulders better warranty, all the same bells and whistles as Honda/Toyota for nearly $10K less! If anyone is looking for a van, I say stop looking and buy and Entourage! If a company is willing to cover their vehicle for 10 yrs/100K miles I'm going to trust that company!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty look, feels like you're driving a much smaller car, great power, great sound, amazing waranty. I could go on and on. We love our van!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife previously drove a Jeep Liberty. She loved that Jeep, but we were running out of space. We shopped around for minivans. The Hyundai was the only one she said she would give up her Jeep for. We like everyting about this van. The engine has great power, the seats are comfortable, very quiet on the road with very little wind noise on the highway, and a awesome stereo system. Three zone climate control is great too. Fit and finish was what was the desiding factor between this and an Odyssey. The new Odyssey's interiors looked and felt cheeper. Entourages fit and finish is unsurpassed. Two things the Honda has over this: VCM (better mpg) and a more refined transmission.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power doors and liftgate, stereo, engine power/torque (this thing gets up and goes), comfortable seats, 2 driver memory on drivers seat that recognizes key fobs. Interior quality is great. Dual glove compartments with deviders (better than Odyssey's). </FAVORITE>

The standard options in the Entourage is incomparable to other models. It rides and handles GREAT. The sound system is fantastic (PE package) and the wireless headset for the DVD is nice. (only get 2,I need 3,$60 for an extra). I would highly recommend taking it for test drive. This van is a force to reckin with.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Surprising amount of power, room, bells and whistles. This minivan MOVES and looks great. Put the pedal down and it growls into action with a very smooth ride. Super amount of seat flexiblity. Some of the best features are rear windows that go down! Dual auto sliding doors. Also automatic rear vented windows. It comes with so many standard options it is a lot of vehicle. 60,000 BUMPER TO BUMPER warranty. Way roomier than Quest and FAR more features. Even cloth seats are heated up front! Dual climate control up front - Superior cooling - 3 sets of cooling vents assure consistency. You really have to check this one out if you are seeking a van. Far too many features to discuss here.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Buy it! I traded our Sante Fe because my father needs a little more comfort. The ride is super quiet. Acceleration is so smooth, you can't feel it. RPM's are great when driving 45-55mph. Wish the gas mileage was a little better, but with all the other pluses, I'm willing to take a small hit on fuel economy.

<TEXT>If you're buying a minivan, you can not beat the value of this Hyundai. It's at the very least neck and neck with Toyota and Honda and the price is far and away a better deal. Go for the Limited with all the bells & whistles and you won't look back. If you're nervous about a first year vehicle, get the dealer to give you free maintenance for 12 months, that should alay fears of unknown bugs in the design. Minivan's are all about functionality, they were designed for one purpose: ease the travel & logistics life of a family, and Hyundai is one of the best before price is even in the equation. Hyundai has put together an excellent package; can't wait for the editor's review & validation!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent blend of comfort & function. Quiet on the street or the highway. Leather qualtiy if much better than in 2001.

<TEXT>our experience so far has been excellent. we were looking at minivans such as the honda oddessy and the toyota sienna, the entourage offered more standard features for much less. the v6 is very powerful, it gives the van a very sporty feel. the suspension allows the van to ride like a four door sedan. the warranty really caught out attention, it is one of a few vehicles that we could payoff before the warranty runs out. features such as power rear doors, rear windows that go down, captains chairs in the middle row, electronic climate control, and the 60/40 third seat are very conveinient. the standard feature of electronic stability control gives you that extra feeling of safety.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great van for the money, can't wait till Car and Driver does a camparo with Honda, Toyota, etc... there may be a new champ in town... Very comfortable, at highway speed it just chews up the miles and spits them out, smooth ride, great power. The SE with premium package gives great values with great options. The beige interior and wood grain interior looks better than the grey/aluminum, and looks very upmarket, not like the cheap GM stuff. Buyer Beware, my local Hyundai dealer in WV puts a bump sticker in the window ($1000) over MSRP then won't deal off of that price, you can get this van for and not have to pay that, just shop at the right place, fair dealers are oput there. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased the 2007 Entourage SE in early 2007 with 100000 mile warranty and 2 years/24000 miles of free oil changes for ~$23000. Odometer now shows 25500 miles. We have driven between Colorado Springs and Boulder CO many times as well as 2 trips to Lake Tahoe. I am very surprised at how many complaints there are regarding mpg - we get 25-27 mpg for our 100+ mile trips and 21mpg for my daily commute of 12 miles. I am conscious of my driving technique and avoid mashing the accelerator or overusing the brakes. I am pleased to report that the mpg display above the rear view mirror is very accurate - within .5mpg every time. I always keep write down miles/gas every time I fill up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's a minivan. It's bigger than a car and very heavy, like other minivans. For us it's an appliance like a refrigerator or washing machine. Yes, the doors will close on little fingers- don't let your kids put their hands in closing doors. Let them fear any doors closing. It will squeak. Push on panels to reseat fasteners. They will be quiet. Two minor issues repaired under warranty: Cold weather caused spring loaded parking brake release to stick, replacement of cables and pedal assembly resolved issue. Idler pulley bearing failure, replacement solved issue. Van will average 29 MPG on flat ground at 60 MPH with NO stop and go. Daily drives around town average 17 MPG.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Until about 6 months ago, I would have said that I was very happy with my van. Now the slider doors are not closing properly (seems to be a common complaint), yet the service dept at our local dealership cannot find anything wrong. The biggest issue is the water leaking from the sunroof, dripping from the control panel(dome lights/door openers,etc. Also, water leaking from the dash when it rains, collecting water on the floor of the passenger side. There are tons of wires down there, so I can't imagine what kind of fun I have to look forward to. I am told that the warranty does not cover "leaks", I find it outrageous that Hyundai thinks that this is normal wear & tear.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My family & I have had this vehicle for a year now w/over 15,000 miles & have traveled a lot since then. So far, we have not encountered any "major" problems that other people have stated in there reviews. I spoke w/a Hyundai mechanic & he told me that this is a heavy vehicle w/a 3.8 Liter V6 engine. So of course the gas mileage is not great. Also a vehicle is considered broken in after 35-50,000 miles & that is when you will start having better gas mileage. But, it also depends on your driving style and terrain as well. My advice, save your money & stick w/a basic van. After reading other reviews, owners of vans w/more amenities seem to have more problems than others,ie. power doors 4 example.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Appearance; simplistic not gaudy, 4 water bottle holders, 10 cup holders, 60/40 split folding rear seats, tasteful and functional design, torque, acceleration, & shiftronic transmission.

<TEXT>The imitation leather trim is starting to split. The van squeaks, makes strange noise when air conditioner not on, and the gas mileage is terrible. Door opens intermittently after closing. Dealer could find nothing wrong with any of these complaints. Will never again purchase new model of any car/van. Door closed on my grandson's finger. Limited driver and front passenger storage space. Third row seat cramped. It is very inconvenient to have to place car in park to open rear doors.

Trim pcs. and hardware in general are falling off and are of poor quality. Gas mileage is terrible (13 in city and just under 20 on hwy). Ouch!!! I would strongly recommend not buying the 2007 model and get the 2008 or 2009 as I would hope Hyundai has worked out all the bad bugs from the 2007 year. Avoid at all cost the 2007!

<TEXT>My boyfriend bought the van over a year ago for him and his kids. He was sold on the "safety feature" that said that any obstruction would automatically open the side door. Since then we have constantly had problems with the power doors-- if you are on any type of incline, the power doors have a great chance of not closing as well as sliding forward on their own. His 9 year old son has actually had his hand crushed in the doors (that DID NOT automatically open) when he was reaching to grab his seat belt to buckle in as the door closed. Both of his children are now terrified of the closing doors and warn their friends to not touch the doors. I am almost 30 and even I get nervous about it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After a history of Saturns, it was time for a minivan. Honda was out of our price range. Grand Caravan seemed cheap inside. We scored after finding this used and the dealer thought it was a base model (& priced as such!)! Great power, 17 mpg seems typical, SO roomy, long warranty, lots of features, awesome safety rating, and everyone thinks it's a Honda at first glance! We've owned it for 5 months and 6K miles. We did have a dead battery and they replaced it with no problems. Very happy with our local dealership. After being a Saturn-only family for 10 years, our newly adopted Hyundai fits in just fine!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had nothing but problems from our 2007 entourage. It has been in the shop for 26 business days (m-f only) and 5 times (8000 mi). We have the same knocking noise others have mentioned, which it has gone up in smoke for (a/c burned out) and stranded us on the interstate w/ my 4 mo old. We have rattles/creaks etc. Poor gas mileage. The a/c is knocking again and we are claiming lemon law. Just yesterday after picking it up from being at the dealer 2 weeks, the airbag light came on. We were told they couldn't get it in until Friday (it is wed) but not to drive it b/c we won't have airbags in the event of a crash (no rentals avail). And Hyundai warranty does not guarantee a rental.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I do like the sliding doors, however ours do not act right 100% of the time...another complaint. The seat controls and gas door opener on the door is very convenient. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After much research and test drives we chose the Entourage because of its comfort, long list of features but most of all, the safety rating for our 3 children. After only a short time we began having problems with front end knocking and vibrating. The brakes wobble, the rear end squeaks and the check enging light frequently comes on as does the air bag light. I've lost count of the amount of times the van has been in the shop but the condition of the van is the same and getting worse. It's obvious now why there is 100k warranty. You definitely need it with this very undependable vehicle. The dealership is useless and the service department is awful. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I thought I'd buy a Honda and be like other good mom's driving an Odyssey. But they wanted about $6K more and a 36K warranty? This family uses the van, we're talking miles, last van-4 years-116K miles. Mileage folks! When we test drove, we parked at a mall to look things over, right next to a family with a top-of-the-line Honda van. The mom keep looking over and asked, what van is that? The Hyundai looks almost like the Honda but I think a little shaper. So far only a couple minor fixes, computer chip, pulley. The original dealer was less than stellar after the sale. But around DC none are known for customer service. Overall a good van and good value for the money. Good warranty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My last van was a Town & Country and I was planing to purchase another one, however, after test driving most of the vans on the market including the Hyundai Entourage, I believe the Entourage is the finest vehicle I have ever owned. The smooth ride, very powerful engine, I love everything about the vehicle. I purchased the high end Limited model with the ultimate package. The leather seats are very comfortable. The second row captain seats move back and forth. The third row seats can be folded into the floor. The five speed automatic with overdrive allows great gas mileage around 25 MPG with the engine at around 2 grand on the tack at 75 MPH. A very fine vehicle, bar none. Thank you!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Wonderful driving experience with the smoothest ride and plenty of head room and leg room. The very powerful engine and transmission. Electric side doors and back hatch are great.

<TEXT>The transmission self destructed on our 1998 Sienna XLE. We weren't planning on a new vehicle purchase so another Sienna XLE was just plain out of our price range. We found an 2007 SE with nearly all of the bells and whistles of the Limited. It landed right in our price range. We will miss our Sienna (it is going to be donated), but the Entourage is bigger, faster, quieter, and has tons more safety and convenience features, while getting the same or better fuel economy. Lastly, it is nice to have a warranty that outlasts the payments. We even upgraded the bumper to bumper to cover the bells and whistles. At the price we got it for ($7000 below MSRP), we could afford to.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was very impressed with Hyundai when I took the Entourage on a test drive. I was shopping for a Honda mini van, and saw a Entourage. I drove a Honda Odyssey, and then drove the Entourage. The Odyssey did handle a little better, but it lacked power that the Entourage had. The main thing that sold me on the Hyundai was the price, and the awesome warranty that the car came with. I mean come on 5 year 60,000 Bumper to Bumper, and 10 year 100,000 miles powertrain, how can you pass that up. The Honda did not offer that. You had to pay thousands for that extended warranty on the honda. The MPG could be a little better, but that may be my habut related problem. I highly recommend it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I rented a 2007 Entourage in Salt Lake City for an 8 day, 1800 mile vacation through Grand Teton and Yellowstone Parks. The drive was on mountainous roads in winter conditions. This vehicle has a strong drivetrain with fast acceleration and effortless mountain climbing power. Handling was sporty and the ride very comfortable. Gas mileage was outstanding and amazing averaging about 27 mpg. This included a considerable amount of stop and go driving between scenic turnouts in both parks, and some idling to keep warm while viewing wildlife, not to mention the cold weather conditions and, at times, snow covered roads. Overall, I am very impressed with this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>At first, I was completely thrilled with our purchase. However, then the problems started. We have had two oil leaks in the first year, one spontaneously shredding wiper (scratched windshield!) followed by two spontaneously NOT-working wipers. Also, we are currently in the arbitration process trying to resolve a loud knocking noise in the front of the car. This alone has brought the car into the shop 5 times!! The gas mileage is definitely lower than advertised, and for the mpg that I actually get, I would rather have a large suv with more power. I do *like* the car's design though. It works well for our family with 3 small children, and comfortably fits all that we require.</TEXT>

Since purchasing in June of 06, dealer had vehicle 2 months trying to "fix". They replaced both front wheel hubs and for 60+ days my problem stopped. Cancelled BBB complaint. It has been a nightmare since then. Still have vibrations, but not all the time. The brake rotors have been turned three times, replaced twice along with pads the last time. Hyundai rep replaced on a goodwill basis. Ain't he nice? Hyundai is finally making me an offer to replace the vehicle completely.

<TEXT>Probably the best bang-for-your-buck vehicle on the planet, and it looks sharp, too! Paid $25K out the door for an SE trim even with over $1K upside down on the trade. SE trim is worth the extra $$ -- much "nicer" inside and out. I don't know how the rest of these people drive, but gas mileage for me averages between 20 and 23 mpg -- great considering it has the biggest engine in its class. Drives like a dream -- great visibility, power and comfort. Considering a comparably equipped Honda or Toyota was $8K, not to mention their warranties were no match, the decision on this vehicle was an easy one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>For the mileage I drive mostly highway (80%)and after 3000 miles I averaged 22 MPG. I can only say that if you are seeing 15 MPG as some have stated, there is a serious problem that needs to be looked at. I can't see why there isn't more of them on the road. My dealer took 2 weeks to find one in red and they didn't have any on their lot. My negatives are... No mp3 jack. Brakes are way too sensitive. Hyundai's radios have always been poor. ( I have owned 4 other Hyundais)The reception is even worse with the in the window antenna. Darker carpet color to hide tracked in dirt. Floor mats are not standard. Give me a break.</TEXT>

Sad thing about both are you carry the family or 'stuff' - but not both. Now I was stuck looking at minivans. Compared the Toy, Honda and the Hyundai and there was only 1 choice. Maybe people feel better spending $40k+ on the same thing from Honda but not me. I like the better warrentee. Build quality is the SAME believe it or not. All the new Hyundai's in the last couple of years have had amazing reliability, rivaling anything from Japan. Spend more if you want to - but all you'll gain is a few more MPG!</TEXT>

I have owed various vans since 1975 and rate this one at the top of my list. The safety features...i.e - ASC, multiple air bags, traction control and back up warning sensors are must options. I have been getting decent mileage (25 mpg ) on the hwys which I feel is good considering the power and size of this van. Hyundai has come a long way with the quality of there vehicles since inception and now can compete favourably with the "Big Boys" (Honda, Toyota, Nissan and Chrysler ) </TEXT>

<TEXT>After suffering sticker shock at my Honda dealer when I found out it would cost over 40 grand for a new '07 Odyssey with the features I wanted, I shopped around and fell in love with Hyundai's Entourage Limited. It has more "bells and whistles" practical features than the Odyssey, but after rebate ended up costing $29,300 including the $4000 Luxury Package. The engine and transmission are unbelievably smooth as is the ride, and after 2 months and almost 4000 miles the van's been flawless. I'm averaging about 20 MPG for blended driving, which for a 4400 pound 7 passenger vehicle with a 250 HP V-6 engine isn't unreasonable.

There were 4 adults & 2 children & we had loads of room & the ride was as smooth as it could be. This was our first minivan & we weren't sure if we would like it or not. We've always had Fords in the past but had several bad experiences with our Explorers. I would definitely recommend this van to anyone that may be on the fence especially if you can't decide between the Hyundai, Toyota, & Honda.

<TEXT>After much inner debate and multiple test drives of both vehicles I choose the Hyundai Entourage Limited over the Honda Odyssey EX. The bottom line reasons are because the Entourage was $5,000 cheaper and had more equipment and a better warranty. Which is the better minivan? I would say that the Honda has a more refined engine, drive train than the Hyundai. I just could not get over the price difference. I received $2500 back plus an additional $1500 off because the dealer had the car since last August. My report card grads are the follwing: Honda gets an A while the Hyndai gets an B+. When you factor in price the Hyndai moves up to an A minus and the Honda still gets an A</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned 5 different makes of mini-vans and the Entourage is the best so far. Well appointed,solid feel,good handling, ample power, super brakes, quiet, smooth riding vehicle. I am 6'4" tall and there is ample room for me. This is a well put together van.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats, power equipment, comfortable seats, good visibility and plenty peppy. I enjoy both CD and cassette ability. Sound system is very good.Tilt wheel is a must for me. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had the van since June of 2006. Love every aspect except fuel mileage. The ride and the feel of the van is terrific. My wife does not want to drive anything else. Took this van on a 1200 mile trip and never had any problems or complaints about comfort. Entertainment system is awesome with the 8 speaker system and Infinity sound.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Horsepower and 6 disc CD with entertainment system. 8 in sub in the back and surround sound!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The advertised gas mileage is a farce. After 14500 miles,I am only receiving about 15.5 miles in the city and 19.5 on the highway.I have driven it with 7 passengers.I have driven it with 1 passenger.I have driven it with reg. unleaded.I have driven it with super unleaded.I have driven it in the winter w/o AC.I have driven it in the spring w/AC.I have even driven it with the tires overinflated as sugg. by my dealer,but to no avail,the mileage has not changed drastically.The break-in mileage was atrocious at 12-13 in the city and 16-18 on the highway.Aside from this issue,I still like the vans appearance.Sleeker & Cheaper than the Sienna.If gas prices were not so outrageous,it would be a 10!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Outer appearance...Does not look like a minivan.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife loves her Entourage! Purchased the LE with all the options. The power liftgate and doors work great. Already have 6000 miles and no problems to date. Dealership has been awesome with standard maintenace checks. I can not see paying the extra money for the Honda and we found the Sienna to be cheaper in quality and way pricier. Highly recommend at least test driving before you lay out the extra cash for other brand!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power doors and lifgate, DVD and Infinity surround sound system, comfortable ride, slit folding flat third row.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We loved all the features in the van, it was so nice with all the compartments and DVD for the kids. The gas mileage they have listed though is criminal, we used Chevron gas, the mid-grade and got about 15 miles to the gallon around town and 19 - 20 on the highway. We used our cruise control and averaged around 70 mph. We consistently got this driving from Portland, OR to SLC, UT. The transmission was slugglish and it didn't respond well. We had oil leaks after we had put 8,000 miles on the van. Overall, we LOVED all the options that were on the inside of the van, however, mechanically, it was inferior to other vans of this class in our experiences. Not our favorite purchase by far!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DVD player, all the compartments and cup holders, rear folding seats were thoughtfully designed. LOVED, loved, loved the rear windows rolling down like in a car, so nice!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Hyundai, we also own a 2002 Sonata with 96K miles. I have nothing but good things to say about Hyundai. Great value and exceptional warranty. We test drove the Odyssey and Entourage. I honestly thought the Entourage was more refined and better handling. The Entourage is also very well powered, it jumps takes right off and does well on highway passing. The saftey features can't be beat. I have 2 sons and a baby on the way, this van is the safest on the market. The value and saftey cannot be beat. We picked the GLS since we don't need the fancy features. With rebates and loyatly owner incentives, I was able to get my Entourage for under 22K out the door.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, warranty, power 2nd row windows, 3rd row hide away seats. Bucket seats are very comfortable. Exterior styling. Saftey features are std on every model</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After a few months of research, I purchased a 2007 Entourage SE for my wife. From what I could tell the Honda had the best overall rating but for me, the Entourage was the best value. The sticker price was 27.500 and with our trade I paid 24,500 out the door. I paid close to the same money for my last van (2002 Windstar) and the Hyundai is three times the vehicle. The best thing is I have five years until I have to worry about my wife calling about a check engine light! It now has 300 miles on it and we really like it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The only thing I wish was available on the SE model was a power rear hatch. The climate control system is a bit confusing for my wife (and me).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drove 800 miles from LA to SF and LA again right after taking the van out of the showroom. Its power and comfort surprised me. At the reasonable price far less than $30,000, all the features of cocnvenience and safety are thoughtful and way beyond any dreamer's expectation. I am so happy with this vehicle that everybody listening to my high recommendation thinks I am carzy with it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I liked the van's handsome nonimposing exterior, intelligently appointed modern interior, generous power, ample interated features, and above all, its quiet ride. I drove all other makes and couldn't get over the noise. The Entourage is whisper quiet in comparison. And still, it compares as good or better than other vans in safety, power, quality, warranty, and price. And the stereo is awesome. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Modern, sophisticated interior design, not quirky like other makes. Shiftronic transmission very nice feature. And the little nonadvertised things: auto-tilt mirrors when reversing, smart rearview mirror, key- coded seat memory, a functional and removable center console. The back-up sensor is a must</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Minivan Gone Bad</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I bought this horrible minivan and have been dissatisfied since.,.Front end vibrates entire car..dealer had car for 1/2 the month and factory rep said "he knows the vibration that I am experiencing"...AND...I m now filing with BBB as Hyundai warranty requests but for the extra $$$ I would have spent--Would have been well worth it to SAVE me this aggrevation...I took another Entourage off the lot & test drove..The vibration existed in the new one toooo..Especially at 75-80 the steering wheel was shaking uncontrollably...Must be an engineering defect or my car was built on a Day before or after a Holiday.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We owned three hyundai vehicles and this lovely minivan is our 3rd one. We have this van since September, 2006. We love every single feature of this vehicle. We owned a Toyota Previa before (a rear wheel drive). The horsepower is only rated at 142 hp. The Entourage has so much power to spare. The gas milage is slightly higher than the Previa but it has 100 hp more. What more can you ask for? I am very happy with the gas milage when comparing to my old Previa. The Entourage is definitely on par with the Honda's or Toyota's minivans but costs a few thousands less. We strongly believe Hyundai's reliability is better than the Janpanese made and we installed a hitch for our new trailer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased yesterday. I was set on purchasing the Odyssey. Wife and I couldn't believe the features along with the price of the Entourage. Safety rating top notch. Figured we would at least test drive. I was amazed at the power. Wife likes the extras that came standard. With the amazing warranty we figured to take a shot. Love the look, feel, features, safety, and price. I am looking forward to posting here once we get about 2k miles on it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I liked the power and the handling. My wife likes the space and features. We both like the safety and warranty. I am anxious to witness its reliability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had the Entourage for 5 months now and am pretty happy with it. The bad is definitely gas mileage - absolutely horrendous (not even close to my V6 Tacoma). I have had minor problems with the TPMS (misread in cold temp), and a sliding door that doesn't close about 5% of the time without retrying. Otherwise, the van has been great. I find the quality above average, the engine sure has some pep and the exterior styling is decent (similar to Odyssey). I would recommend this car to someone who is planning on driving the car for years as no doubt it's resale value will not be that of Honda, Toyota, Nissan etc.</TEXT>

<TEXT>i m overall pleased w/ my purchase after the first two months of ownership. the van has more than adequate power, great sightlines w/ almost no blindspots. drives solid as a rock, w/ plenty of cargo space. definitely would recommend to others, knowing that the gas mileage is not that great. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>was delighted 2 c shortly after i bought the vehicle that it received the highest safety rating (five stars) for minivans! also, the price speaks for itself, as no other van that we could find had as many features in this price range, especially the rear power lift gate. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Absolutely LOVE this van. I really was only considering an Oddysey or a Sienna and after reading several reviews on this minivan, we had to go and test drive one before spending much more on one of the "others". We drove it right off the showroom floor. First and foremost, the safety factor was far better than anything we had seen. We even went the starter model because it was so well equipped. My husband could not be happier with this purchase since it has the auto- manual transmission and he can "pretend" to race. :) I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone considering a minivan purchase. Honda and Toyota better watch out because Hyundai is proving to be a winner!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had this van for about 4 months and have put 5000 miles on it with no problems.This van is awesome on the interstates and highways and has plenty of power.It is nice looking inside and out and seems to be well built. This is the fourth mini van we have owned, with the last being a Chevy Venture. The Entourage is a much better van.So far, my wife and I do not have any complaints.I do wish it got a little better mileage.Perhaps as the engine/transmission get more loose,it will.It gets about 21-22 mpg on the interstate at 75 to 78 miles per hour.Probably at 65 to 70 miles per hour miles per hour the mileage would be better.The warranty is excellent.Great van and I highly recommend it.</TEXT>
