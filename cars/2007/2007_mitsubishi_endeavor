<TEXT>This is my wife's car and she loves it as much as me. Strong engine, great ride, handles like a car, and she loves the no touch AWD. I know she and my boys are safe in any situation. Did I mention it is fun to drive, especially with the auto stick shift!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Peppy engine, great ride, AWD works great, and did I mention the auto stick shift. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I previously owned a Mitsubishi Montero Sport which I drove for 10+ years. Hated to get rid of it so I thought another Mitsubishi would be a good purchase. Gas mileage has been 18 mpg consistently, less than what I got in my MS (which was 19-20 mpg). It it a bigger SUV. Seats are comfortable and great room inside. I have used the back for moving large items and have taken several trips with dog crates so if you need cargo storage, this vehicle can handle the load. Because I loved my Montero Sport so much, I do compare the two vehicles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very roomy inside, love the blue dash instrument panel and pretty decent stereo system. I like the way the back seat folds down completely "flat". Tire storage area also hides other small items (jumper cables, ice scrapers, etc.) Just had to change a headlight bulb and it was very easy. A/C great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought our Endeavor after owning a 2004 Lancer Ralliart to have more room and cargo space. We absolutely love it. It's comfortable, rides great, and has plenty of power. We have also only run 87 octane and have not had any problems or noticeable loss in gas mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable for 7 adults, great head room for taller people, blue dash lights, great power, large cargo area, sportronic shift</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I shopped around for about a month or so for a few Ford Trucks . I went by accident by the Mitsubishi lot because I was driving around the auto mall and saw the Endeavor and there was only two left, I drove it and was like WOW this drives just like a car I do go on occasional trips and its great. It has every thing I could ask for great sound great ride . beautiful interior and decent gas mileage for the size. I would recommend this car to anyone , and if i ever get another car it will be a Mitsubishi for sure.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the whole suv, really like the seats and the way it handles..</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Great Deal</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Traded in a Buick SUV that did not make it past 85K miles. Test drove the Honda Pilot and Outlander prior to buying my Endeavor. The Endeavor outperformed the Pilot, had much smoother ride and comfort. The Outlander was in the running but was just a bit to small. After rebates got the Endeavor for the same price as the Outlander. This SUV rides like a car! Very stable and lots of room. Averaging 18.5 MPG with 50% city, 50% highway with 6k on the engine. Hoping it gets a little better. I only used premium gas for the first fill up (from the dealer). Runs fine on regular. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>10 year 100k warranty, ride quality, blue lighting on the dash, lots of room. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove a lot of midsize suv's before deciding on the endeavor. I had a 2004 Tahoe z71 and traded it because I wanted better gas mileage and a better warranty. This vehicle is so nice to drive, feels stable, great gas mileage, my kids and all their gear fits comfortably in this car. And it can tow our four wheelers without a problem. The sound system is awesome with the subwoofer. By far better than the others for the price. We got the dvd system and the kids love it when we are on road trips. Great investment. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system, heated seats,leather holds up well with kids and pets. Smooth, solid ride. A lot better gas mileage than the Tahoe. 17-19 around town and 19-22 on hwy. The Tahoe only got 10 mpg to maybe 14 mpg hwy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have had the Endeavor for 1 year and is very pleased. We use REGULAR GAS in it without any ill effects. Averages 19-20 MPG... which is better than My Honda Pilot EX. Build quality is not yet up to Honda standards. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Top of the line Stereo System, Roomy Interior, Good Gas mileage, Good Performance on Regular Gas, More Leg Room than Honda</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle after painstaking research and test drives of so many others similar in this class. I have to say that have no regrets with my decision for many reasons. I had used this forum as the basis for my final decision and most of the other reviewers and I are in agreement. Overall one of the best deals out there. I live in a snow region and my first driving experience was during a blizzard. While other SUVs and 4WD vehicles where busy with low speed flashers, I cruised along effortlessly among the pack. Smooth ride, lots of midrange power, very roomy, and excellent driver response. Did I mention my insurance rates dropped lower than another vehicle I own, a 1997 Passport?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth engine and ride, warranty, cargo area, abundant safety features, and access to controls. I feel in total command of the roadway in this vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>1- It needs PREMIUM gas or it runs very poorly (weak, and low MPG) 2- Engine has good power, but only with PREMIUM fuel 3- PREMIUM fuel is very expensive. 4- Cheap, tacky plastic fittings in the interior 5- Good interior room. Comfortable seats 6- Exterior styling is hard to get used to. I bought this SUV and now I regret it. Before you buy an Endeavor, be sure you know that PREMIUM fuel is required. It gets VERY expensive to operate this, along with the poor gas milage (15 city, 20-21 hwy, that's with the expensive Premium gas) I know other people like this SUV, but I can't afford PREMIUM gas all the time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I LOVED my Endeavor... until I got into a 6 car pile up caused by MY endeavor. The car ran perfectly, was SO much fun to drive and it looked and felt brand new even after a year of driving. In a snow storm, I was moving 15 mph and a simply tapped on my brakes slightly, the brakes locked instantly, caused me to slide across the divider into oncoming traffic. There was NO reason the brakes should have locked. The insurance adjustor agreed with me. The body structure allowed for my survival but it wouldn't have happened in the first place if my brakes didn't lock. Don't go for looks alone and be careful if you purchase it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>The vehicle handles like a car. Needed a vehicle big enough to ride a family with two big kids. The kid?s first comment was wow they love the leg room. Everyone sits good. Not clunky like other SUV?s I owned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the warranty. The vehicle handles great, more like a car then a truck. The vehicle feels safe when driving. Lots of airbags. Smooth ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This has got to be my fav car to own so far! I have owned many, I also test drove many SUVs before buying this one. I love it, it is roomy, yet not to large. There is enough room in the back for the kids and there uncle. and they are comfortable. The kids don't complain that there is no room. There is also great leg room in the back for taller people. My brother is 6ft and he fits back there just fine. Never have a complaint.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the sunroof as well as the stereo system! It is great for being factury! I will not be replacing it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded a Lexus for this vehicle and it is one of the smoothest riding SUV that I have ever owned. Gas mileage is outstanding and it has so much leg room and head clearance that it is the perfect SUV that a person can and will ever drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I got the nav and Sun and sound Pkg. I enjoy the sirpus radio and also the cup holders are plentiful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I have driven ours over 3000 trouble free mostly highway miles. We're more pleased with our purchase now then when we rolled it off the dealer's lot. This is a very good highway vehicle. One of my biggest concerns about a vehicle of this type was how well it would handle cross-winds and truck wash. Well it is no longer a concern. It's the most stable vehicle I've owned in those conditions. This SUV should not be the well kept secret that it is. The Endeavor is a must drive for those in the market for a mid-size crossover that don't require a third seat. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very good low end punch, highway stability, overall comfort, it's nimble for such a heavy vehicle, visibility, it doesn't look like all the other suburban cruisers, all the safety features, insurance cost, and the Rockford acoustic design audio system w/Sirius is sublime.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>About 1000 miles now, really great overall product. Responsive, fun to drive, peppy, really nice ergonomics, and fuel efficiency has been surprisingly strong at over 22mpg consistently. Drove everything on the market, 4runner, LR2, you name it, this is really the best overall package for the best price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great sound system, fine engine, real nice fuel economy, most comfortable rear seat in class and still nice cargo area. Pretty neat computer system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I tried a bunch of SUVs and did my homework before buying my Endeavor SE two months ago. I made the right choice. I just couldn't find a better deal for the money. It's got great looks, ride, terrific stereo, room for everything, torque and performance not to mention a great warranty. I got just about every option available, I plan to keep it a long time. Navigation system could be better by mentioning street names like the Gremlin, and not talking so much. I got a 2005 DVD navigation disc instead of a 2007 or 2008 version? Going to have to call. Folding the back seats I had enough room for several 6 foot long picnic tables inside and I could close the hatch. My girlfriend loves it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great stereo, room for everything, passenger and/or cargo, performance (it's fast), looks, good ride, air bag system, warranty. You don't have to use premium gas all the time, but the performance and mileage does suffer a bit. Otherwise it's just about right. I am getting 15-17 city and 20-22 highway.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you drive this truck, it is impossible not to buy one. Every thing about this SUV is great, the looks, the interior, performance, warranty, and safety. I bought this truck for my wife and I end up driving it more then her because it is so much fun to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Endeavor rides so smooth and the 3.8L V6 has a lot of pickup and go. The Endeavor comes standard with so many airbags and safety features. The exhaust note on it always makes me smile.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am comparing this vehicle directly to my 2006 Honda Pilot EX. The Endeavor SE with Navigation is very easy to drive. I love the 360 watt sound system. It is heads and shoulders above the 6 disc sound system that is available in the Honda Pilot EX.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the 360 watt sound system, the sub vibrates through the floor. This vehicle feels very stable..</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have test driven all of the competition and found that the Endeavor is unparalleled in comfort and ergonomics. If you are searching for an SUV that is an all around great bargain, search no further. I still can't believe all the standard features and 10yr/100k warranty at this price! It is definitely worth your time to test drive one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The smooth ride, really cool dash and control panel.</FAVORITE>
