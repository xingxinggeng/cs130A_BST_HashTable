<TEXT>I purchased my Pontiac G5 in 2007. I would not trade her for the world. Everyone assumes i spent alot more then i did on her. With the extra money i saved purchasing her, i was able to get the windows tinted and she looks sharper then any foreign car out there. She looks and sounds great with the exhaust tip i was also able to purchase with the fuel savings i enjoy. If you want a REAL deal, look into and purchase a G5. You will never be sorry...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my G5 for almost 2 years now. I absolutely love this vehicle. The handling is great. Purchased $15k, the car feels like a luxury car. The seats are comfortable, and gas mileage is great! I average 25/city and at at 75mph I get 36/37 mpg freeway! The car quickly becomes like an extension of yourself on the road.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the exterior of the vehicle! The fuel economy of the vehicle was a wallet saver these past few months! The sound system is great. The remote start is wonderful in the winter/summer when you want to unthaw/cool down the car before you get it. It's always a head-turner</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my G5 GT for almost a year and a half and love it. It is always a head turner, and hardly anyone else has one. The only problems I've had is a broken sunroof switch, replaced under warranty, and a glitch in the keyless entry that others have noted. This was my first new car, and I couldn't be happier.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sunroof, Pioneer system, wheels, steering wheel cruise and audio controls, remote start (nice in the winter and impresses the ladies).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Don't get me wrong, I love my G5. Love the exterior looks. Black leather, heated seats (That's what sold me.) But the windshield wipers are horrible, I can see better without turning them on. Rear spoiler blocks view, but you get used to it. I don't how anyone gets 36 mpg with it. I get 21 in the city(moderate traffic) and the best i have ever gotten is 26 on hwy. (I'm delicate with my car). And biggest concern, only after 30k mi. Both of my front tires blew out, on the same day. It was like something cut them in a perfect circle on the inside of the tire. I was stuck in BFE Arkansas at a gas station. Dangerous! also having problems with my remote keyless entry</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats.Decent gas mileage.Very fun to drive.when my keyless entry remote worked,only for about 6 months.I tried to replace the battery but didn't help,my alarm would go off when i tried to use it. it would only stop when you started the car. I DID love the remote start.(especially in the winter)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my G5 for about 8 months now and I really like it. The power is there when you want it, and when you need it. It's real fun to take a sharp turn with, or fit in tight squeezes while switching lanes. The gas is very good, especially when going highway. I drive it every single day and every time I fill up my gas tank someone always comments on how nice my car is. White G5 GT with Custom 18" Black Racing Rims, with 40 meat kumho tires and 20% window tint all the way around.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for almost 6 months now and it has been in the shop four times. The windshield makes noise, like wind is coming in somewhere. The front end has had the bearings replaced, the struts, and the rotors have already been turned, and need to be done again. I noticed if the car sits for more than a week, the rotors are totally shot. Is this something that anyone else is having problems with? I'm also not happy with the noise in the car, all the plastic is coming loose already. I actually own a Honda Civic Si, and I haven't had any problems with it, as well as my Scion TC. I wish I wouldn't have bought this car, but thankfully I purchased an extended warranty!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my GT for a little over a year without any problems. The gray metallic paint, coupe styling, spoiler and 17" brushed aluminum wheels get lots of compliments. It's fun to drive and I appreciate the maneuverability in city driving. City mileage is just fair, but I just returned from a road trip and got a little over 36 mpg on the highway. A little too much wind noise on the highway - but less than in my co-worker's 2007 Camry! I was very pleased with this car when gas was $2 a gallon - I"m thrilled with it at $4.50 a gallon! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great features like the power sunroof, sound system, mp3 jack and information center. I like the steering wheel controls. Gas mileage is good, especially on the expressway. 5-speed Getrag transmission is very smooth shifting. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After countless used cars, I finally decided to get a new car, and what a fabulous decision I made to buy a brand new Pontiac G5. Keeping price in mind, I went with the base model, which still has great performance and equally impressive looks. My personal record average was 38.7 MPG in medium/light traffic on the interstate for an hour. Unlike most other cars I have driven, the headrests are actually effective and the seats are amazingly comfortable. For being over 6 feet tall, I have more than enough leg room and my head doesn't ever bump the ceiling. The interior controls are clustered intuitively and to my taste. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had the car for almost a year now, no problems and love it. The car rides and handles great, even at high speeds it's a smooth ride. The turning radius is excellent, I can pull a u-turn just about anywhere and park in the smallest places. (I tried the Chevy Cobolt GT and it does not do this and they are suppose to be the same?) Great MPG 36 mpg, with automatic. Very Quite inside, not air noises, road noise. Great dash, XM radio, mp3 connection. Nice styling, inside and out. Beat all the imports. We have the base module with the confort package, and sport package that may be the difference between ours and other ratings. Great looking 18 in mag wheels, controls on the leather wraped wheel</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fit and finish, size, turning radius, ride, style, price, comfort, interior exterior. Everything about the car is excellent. It was listed at 18500, out the door for 13,500 and it drives like most cars that are 25,000 dollar cars. You should get one with the comfort package, and sport package.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought two vehicles in 07 this G5 and a mid size SUV. I drive 135 miles daily and picked this G5 over the smaller foreign brands for my commute. I am an old man compared to the kids driving this car. Have been driving 40 years and owned as many vehicles. I love this car all around.Handling, ride, and mileage obtained. At 80 MPH I get 30 MPG and at legal speeds on the interstate as high as 37.7 MPG! Power is good. Love the XM & seat comfort setting as low as it can go. I am 5? 11? 215lbs and perfectly comfortable driving three hours daily. Good choice no regrets at 22K and climbing fast.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love my 2007 Pontiac G5. But now it is starting to have problems already and it hasn't even been five months since I bought it brand new off the lot. I'm not sure if it is just my car experiencing these problems or if there are others, but there are not any recalls about leaks. Two months after I bought the car, the front windshield leaks. We just recently had a big rainstorm, I go look in my trunk and there is a good 3 inches of standing water in my trunk surrounding my battery. Other than these problems, which shouldn't be happening, this car is a great choice for my first car. Nice and smooth riding.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car handles great, even at high speeds it's a smooth ride. I can pull a u-turn just about anywhere and park in the smallest places. When I baby it I can get over 35 mpg and so far I haven't dropped below 32. When it's cold out I can hear a rattle coming from the front passenger side, I don't know what it is but it hasn't been a problem. My car suprises everyone with it's speed. It's no race car, but for it's class it's impressive. I can easily turn em over in second gear with 3 passengers.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's so light that you can really notice the torque so it's not necessary to go over 3000 RPMs. the ECOTEC engine amazes me, good power and the oil life sensor gives me around 10,000 miles on an oil change. The sound system is nice and the interior is modern and cool. It's quiet as well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We looked at and tried a lot of cars, but didn't care for them. My wife suggested that we go to a Pontiac dealer and see what they had. I had never seen a G5, didn't know they existed. The G5 is a real sleeper. It makes you want to throw rocks at the other cars, especially those overrated Asian cars that people are so proud of. Phooey! When I saw the American G5, I knew it was right. I was so certain about this car that I bought it outright without driving it first. My wife and I love it. It's everything we want in a car. We are so glad that we found it. This sport coupe has class. The boring Asian cars have no more charm than kitchen appliances.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We like the smooth 4 speed automatic, and enjoy the sunroof. The seats are comfortable, and the car's styling is the best in it's class by far. The ride beats the Asian cars, especially over rough surfaces, like rail crossings. The Pioneer sound system is the best I've ever owned.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After a month, we've got 2000 miles and am really convinced it's the right car for me. We went planning to get another G6 but decided to check out the less expensive G5. I'm 6'4" and didn't really think it would work out for me but it does! I even had room in the one with the sunroof! Tight handler, roomy for 2 plus luggage and getting better than EPA rated 32 mpg. Have to watch it though, it sneaks up to 80 mph real easily!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The price was great, and the economy is typical of a 4 cylinder (hi 20s in town, mid 30s highway---regular gasoline). I don't see a compelling reason to go Japanese any more if vehicles like these continue being offered. Interior for me as the driver centers on ease of getting to the radio, ample opportunities of getting the iPOD connected to my radio, simple reach for the HVAC. Mine is the coup and blind spots abound, as others have probably noted. I would have no problem buying this car again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quietness when going down the road. Even at 80 mph, the interior is quiet, and the little tiny 4 cyclinder motor isn't heard while at cruise. Economy is great on the highway, so-so (high 20s) in town.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 1st car and just clicked over 13000k and so far the car has been good through the summer and very reliable in winnipeg's -40 weather.Brakes rust really badly and look terrible behind the revealing rims.This car is tough to upgrade power wise without putting alot of money into it,it can handle bolt ons but anything more and you will need new injectors and a tune that will void your warrenty.Premium fuel is recommended and it shouldn't run without it if u want optimum performance, but with the price of gas its getting harder to afford the extra 10-15 cents per liter.Gas mileage is so so i get about 24mpg all city.Overall very good car in 5 speed very fun and i recommend it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my sec time posting about my car. I first posted when I got the car. Now I have had the car a year and it has 10k on it. I just took my car on vacation and we drove over 3000 miles in less then 3 days. On the highway with 4 people in the car, all our stuff in the trunk and the ac on max I got 32.5 mpg at 75 mph. After I got back I wanted to run the car at the track to see its 1/4 time so I did and with me, my uncle and a full tank of gas, it ran a 15.7 at 88 mph. This car has taken all the abuse I have given it and with it being my first 5-speed car ever it's been one hell of a car. It's never been in for warranty work and I definitely will be buying another Pontiac after this one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The whole car. It's fun to drive, corners well and gets great gas mileage. The nice color orange it came in and the aftermarket for this car is getting good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my cometition yellow G5 for over 3 months now, and this car really rocks. When I drive like a gentleman, with cruise control set to 57 mph, I get better then 43 MPG! I have a few packages with the car, #1 being the sunroof which includes an upgraded sound system (bass reflex port in trunk) and XM radio included for a full year. Just a wonderful experience for a guy who will never buy an import. GM got its act together quite well with this car. More trunk space then expected plus pass through to interior cabin was handy. The 16 inch tire/mag wheel combo helps hold the road.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great handling, steers and turns on a dime with no tire squeal, just hugs the road. Pickup is more then I expected with a 2.2 liter 4 banger, and braking is straight and true. Remote starter helps in foul weather, and the A|C and heater systems work very well. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have this fun little car for almost a month now. Basically, it is as everyone else has said and if I were to fault this car at all, it would be for the interior plastics. The plastics are easy to scratch. Easy. I mean, you don't mean, but you look, and you see you scratched something. What did it, a coin? Ring? Finger nail? The design layout of the plastic pieces is good, and that is cause of the scratching. There's a cubby hole for pens, an area to lay the iPod, lots of nice areas to lay thing, but that is how the scratches occur. I gave it "5" for interior design due to this.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Pontiac G5 coupe that I purchased and drove for two weeks has problems. The wind noise in the car is terrible. You can hear the wind noise above the radio when driving at speeds above 50 mph. I had warped rotors on the car that cause the steering wheel to shake upon braking. The trunk opening space is very small and makes things difficult to put in. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned this car for about two weeks and have driven it about 1000 miles. The car sounds like it has a window open when driven over 45mph. You can hear the air rush over the radio it is so bad. The steering wheel has shaking problems when I step on the breaks. The trunk opening is very small which is a drawback to the big space inside it. I was promised a cruise control for it only to find the EVS dealer is putting on an aftermarket version with no warranty. This car is a terrible car in all of these respects.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for about a week, so long term details obviously aren't here. But I've absolutely loved it. I had already bought a G6 earlier this year and was looking to get another, but the style and color I wanted was sold just before I got to the dealer. Looking around the lot I saw the G5, a 5 speed, very basic model. I hadn't driven a stick in years, but I found it immediately easy and fun to drive. The bottom line is this: needing 2 cars to replace aged ones, we were able to get a G5 and G6 for about the price of a Hummer's front end suspension! Can't recommend them too much.</TEXT>

The rims are great stock, not cheap. I drove a Miata and miss the convertible but I am getting an installed moonroof. It is a great car to drive and I can fill up for $35 and get 300 miles. It is a looker and I love attention. If you dont like attention, dont get yellow. I test drove many, and the stick GT is the way to go, great buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car with high hopes getting out of a high price for repair VW. Well good thing this car came with a great warranty because I used it 4 times already. My clutch had a manufacturing defect which made it pop off the plate twice leaving me stranded. So they put in a new clutch plate. Then my rotors went at 9000 miles and had to be resurfaced, which they called normal. I've had cars go 30k and not need that. This car just feels poorly made overall. It's peppy for a 4 banger but the handling is too loose and the transmission shifts awkwardly rough compared to my old cars. I really wouldn't waste your money. I'll definitely never buy another Pontiac again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my car, but not long after buying it things started rattling inside. My husband's Pontiac does that, too. Does anyone else think the interior of Pontiac's just doesn't hold together very tightly?</TEXT>

<TEXT>A fun car to drive. It's very sporty and has great pickup for only having a 4cylinder. My fiance is always bugging me to let her drive it as well. Overall, a great car and my favorite yet of the 4 cars I have owned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Moonroof/stereo package, great pickup, large, roomy back seats, large, deep trunk, great turning radius and response, just fun to drive</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My G5 is so sweet, she drives so well.The pickup in my G5, I'd never know it was a 4 cyl. The pickup is great and all turns and u turns are remarkable.My G5 is so perfect for me. I sit in drivers seat high & can see great.I have to be careful not to get a speeding ticket,my G5 flies so fast I can't believe it;s a 4 cyl.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Body style is great, coupe looks stylish.Interior feels like a small coupe,but with large back seats and huge trunk, no way G5 is compact to me.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wish I didn't buy this car. The Cobalt SS is about the same price and a much better performer. The G5 is a good look decent all around car, but just don't offer the kind of performance it should at the selling price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was skeptical in buying this car since it was only out for a month or so when I bought it...But after I did I was very satisfied with my decison. The seats take a little time to get comfortable to. Acceleration and gas mileage are great. For me, the as mileage is peaking at 25 mpg for light highway, mostly city driving which is average. The handling is great too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th Pontiac purchase and the smallest one yet - but not the slowest! The GT trim definitely outguns and is better handling than my '01 Grand Am SE, which was a 4-cyl. as well. Though the Monsoon system is a little complicated to work at 1st, the steering controls make it much simpler! And the acceleration in such a slight car is awesome!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fav feature is a toss up between the HEATED leather seats or the throaty exhaust from the unmodified factory system. Only thing missing is Rally stripes!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a fun car to drive! This is a nice car that is a 4 cylinder but seems like a 6 cylinder. It has a great suspension system and handles bumps and curves nicely! It doesn't hesitate to get up and go when necessary!</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a great car for the price. I wanted to "Buy American" and couldn't be more pleasantly surprised with Pontiac's newest offering. Sporty looks, comfortable ride, nimble handling, and great gas mileage from a quiet, smooth, peppy engine. It has all the features I was looking for, many unexpected on a car at this price point. Leather, heated seats, On-Star, and the Pioneer sound system with the ipod input jack are all great in this class of car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>i just bought the G5 GT with the 5 speed tranny and i love the car. the power its got the sound of the muffler when you hit the gas is the best. it rides so smooth and the cabin has very little road sound comeing in. the sound system in that car is very nice with the 10 inch sub in the trunk and the XM radio free for the first year. i got the orange sunburst color and people always are telling me how nice it looks. i found a nice car and i'm very happy with it good job pontiac!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my G5 on 8/28/06. So far I am very impressed. This 4 cylinder engine is very powerful. Shifting is very smooth with the 4 speed automatic transmission. I live in a very hilly area in New York state and have had no problems getting up these hills. If you have looked at this car then take a second look. Breathtaking!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>There are many standard features on this car that are optional on other cars in the same class. Blue Streak Metallic is a color that needs to be seen in person. Online pictures do not do this color justice. Sun and Sound package are top rate. XM satellite radio is great! LOVE THIS CAR!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my G5 for two weeks now and this is an excellent vehicle in so many ways! I had the Vibe before this and the G5 has a lot of zip and is GREAT on gas! The black interior is very sharp and the bright yellow paint provokes all kinds of comments from people when I drive around. I have the 1st one sold in my small city and I couldn't be more pleased!! I choose to buy American made vehicles, have driven in similar sized imports that belong to friends and this GM car is FAR superior!! The 12 months of XM, music downloads and cool interior accents are just an awesome bonus!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a current owner of the G5 GT. I am very satisfied with the car. The power of the GT engine actually works well with the auto transmission. This is my first car ever to not be a manual. The best part about the car is the handling. The sport tuned suspension of the GT combined with the electronic power steering can really hold the road. All GM cars I have driven before as rentals felt like I was driving a boat. The GT does not. It handles well, feels solid and secure, and allows for quick and nimble driving. Overall the car is a solid buy. Good power, handling, looks, and comfort for the price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My car came with a year's worth of XM satellite service and 365 music downloads which is nice. Also the remote start feature is fun to show off to people. The trunk is huge.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The G5 GT is my first brand new car purchase. I couldn't have picked a better car. I love it!! It is perfect for me. It's sporty, great gas mileage I average 21 mpg every day to and from work and I work 35 to 40 miles from home. These are definitely not the 4 cylinders of old. The motor has power I never expected. It's fast and it's sharp!! I like the looks I get when I pull in somewhere. No one has even seen this car yet and I have been told several times that it looks like a GTO at first glance, that's sweet. My GT has an awesome interior design. I love this car and I am very lucky to have it. Thanks Pontiac!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased my 2006 Pontiac Pursuit G5 (we had it in Canada before the U.S), and I absolutely love it. The 2.2 litre mated to the 4 speed automatic is just great. It shifts smoothly, and has plenty of power to spare. The interior quality is superior to any prior gm products, and the silver-colored accents on the dash board give the interior an upscale feel. Furthermore the stock radio/CD player is very good (considering the price of the car). In addition to that, the trunk is of a decent size, although the opening is a bit narrow. As far as road handling capabilities, the G5 soaks up any frost heaves and cracks in the road, transfering very little noise into the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Absolutely nothing negative. I think with quality like this the American Car perception is crazy. Anyone that thinks they can they can buy a better import is smoking crack. With a standard 5 year 60,000 mile powertrain warranty, 3 year 36,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty makes for worry free driving. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE> XM radio for free (1 year), down load all your favorite songs from your I- pod. Very responsive even though I went with the base car. THE GT MUST BE BAD TO THE BONE! Very quiet smooth but agile sporty handling that pontiac is known for.</FAVORITE>
