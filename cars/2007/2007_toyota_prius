<TEXT>I bought my Prius used from a limo company. Got a great deal because they took good care of it. I am 6'5 and 240 lbs. and fit fine. It's a great car and I have a lot of fun with it. The pickup is good for a 4 cylinder and better when Premium gas is used. Gotta love it when I fill up the tank with premium for $25 and drive 450 miles. My wife owns a Lexus SUV and we take my car more often than hers. I'd buy another one but a new one next time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'll give you the fact that the vehicle gets great gas mileage, but the savings in gas is offset by the cost to maintain. $500 to replace a headlight, $50 to replace a tail light, cost of replacement tires because the manufacturer puts an odd size on the car, $60 for a cabin air filter, and the list goes on.... Trendy car that needs a bit more disclosure as to what it really is - a really poorly designed car is easy on gas but hard on the wallet in other ways. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the car new (2.5 years ago). I have 47,000 miles without any trouble. Only complaint is an annoying rattle. I'm getting around 47 MPG overall. 53 on longer freeway trips. I can get five people in it relatively comfortably (one or two kids) for what it is (day trips). Power is better than most four cylinder cars. It won't beat a corvette, it wasn't meant to. With the back seat folded down it holds a great deal. Toyota delivered what they promised. I'd buy one again in a second (after I wear this one out first).</TEXT>

<TEXT>My '07 Prius is getting well over 50 miles/gal, and I chuckle as I drive past the gas station! It is without a doubt the best car purchase I ever made. I like having the key fob rather than a conventional key to open & start the car, and appreciate the feature that will not permit you to lock the key inside!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my 2007 GEN2 Prius. It is an amazing car for what it is. It is now a luxury car, it is not sexy, it does not pick up chicks. However it does cost nothing to drive and is a great car. I use it for surfing, biking, etc and love it. The one main issue is the drivers seat legroom. I am 6'5 and it didn't work.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Prius is manufactured in Japan, except for the Goodyear tires. Guess where all of my problems have been. With the tires. I had to replace one with a leak through the side wall. Should have been covered by warranty, but it wasn't. They said we must have abused it, which we didn't. Now another tire has a slow leak. I paid $10 to fix it but it still leaks. I add air every 10-12 days. Next time I get Japanese tires. Short trips in Minnesota winter gets me only 36 mpg, but usually I get 46-50. In Hot Springs, Arkansas area I got 55 last year. It likes hills, doesn't like cold. My Camry only gets 31, so it sits.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Pruis in 2006 for $27000. It only has a few options (Stability control, side airbags, ect.), but the dealer forces you to pay $2000-3000 over MSRP. Since I bought the car I've had to replace the batteries twice and the interior has fallen apart worse than the 1998 Ford Escort I was replacing. Even the gas mileage hasn't been great, because the batteries don't work properly in cold weather. The worst part however is the driving experience, the Pruis has a serious shortage of power and has no steering feel. I found the brakes very weak and delivered almost no pedal feel. The seats are also very uncomfortable. I find the ride rough and the whole car shudders over all bumps.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my 2007 Prius nicely discounted with around 50,000 miles. I've had it a month, and so far so good. Millage ranges in the mid 40's, about the same city/highway. Also, unlike the horror stories I was reading about the traction control, she ran fine through the worst of two snowstorms. On hills, the car does struggle when climbing, and the car does move a bit in high winds, drawbacks far outweighed by it's efficiency, and it's maneuverability, and it's handling in almost all conditions. As a parting note, the space age exterior design is sleek, sporty, and unique. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The energy monitor, along with the rest of the on board computer is a wonderful tool. I would suggest a more conventional approach to the climate control, the fan being difficult to adjust while driving.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall a great car. I live in Boston and year round I get the EPA 46 mpg. The technology is great - bluetooth, GPS, dimming mirror, stability control - all excellent. Watch out for the stereo. Even the high end has no mids or bass. I had to get a subwoofer and it helped. Also, the traction control for the snow on all of Toyota's hybrids is poor but livable. The deal with poor mpg in the cold weather has to do with the heater. Short cold trips kill the mileage because the Prius uses the engine to heat the car. This requires it to idle and run constantly until it is up to temp to heat the car's interior. So if you want better mileage leave the heat off until the engine warms.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my Prius 6 weeks back. I absolutely love it!! Before this I was driving BMW X5, Now I like the Prius much better. Fuel economy may be the reason. I drive 125 miles everyday (all highway) and I track all my gas purchase, date filled and number of miles. So far I am getting 56 miles per gallon and that is awesome as compared to my BMW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought a Prius in November, and it does not live up to the hype. The keyless entry system stopped working at 2,500 miles and has required 3 trips to the shop to fix. The seats are VERY uncomfortable on long trips, and everything is just waaay too complicated to operate (audio, temperature, etc.), and I hate doing it all on the screeen--whatever happened to simply turning a knob?!. Finally, the real MPG is nothing even close to that listed on the sticker. Over the life of the car so far, I have averaged 36.6 MPG. Granted, I am in stop and go traffic, but isn't it supposed to workbest in those conditions? All-in-all, I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Prius, is a joy to drive. I can keep up with all traffic on the Interstate, and have actually gotten a speeding ticket. I average 51 MPG and, living in Wisconsin, I was worried about driving in snow and also driving in the heat. No problem on either count. It is sure footed in the snow, and the AC works beautifully. I haul four dogs with me, and am an avid gardner. I just fold down the back seats and haul either dogs, or large bags of dirt. Again, no problem. It is just a fun car to own.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went from a Land Rover Discovery to a 2007 Prius. I never saw myself in a hybrid. The Prius is the best vehicle I have ever owned. It is very comfortable and with 50 mpg average you can't beat the savings at the pump. The technology in this car is amazing. If you can get the navigation and rear view camera buy it, it is well worth it. The bluetooth enables you to recieve and make calls from your steering wheel. The keyless entry and ignition puts this car over the top.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2004 Acura TL for a 2007 Prius Seaside Pearl with options package #4. I was looking to downsize from my TL due to low mileage, 6K a year, and the desire to just have an economical commuter car with great gas mileage. I looked at the Honda Civic Hybrid but felt the Prius offered better gas mileage and features. So far I like my Prius. It is simple, drives well, has good pickup, great features,and great gas mileage plus Toyota reliability. For some, choosing a Prius is to help the environment, for others its saving gas. For me it was needs vs wants. I love nice sedans but only need a commuter car. The Prius is that and much more. Saving gas etc. was just a very big plus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The front seats of this car are comfortable but they lack the space to move back. The rear seats are very uncomfortable unless you add 5,000 for leather seats and other unwanted options. Mileage was a consistent 44 mpg and on the freeway the engine was straining. The LCD was unneeded and only my kid could figure it out, but overall it is an OK car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first new car in 7 years. I'm a real techy, gadgety type of guy and absolutely love this vehicle. We are getting approx 44 mpg with less than 1000 miles on the car so far. Traded in a 2001 PT cruiser that got a whopping 18 mpg in the city. The gas bill is already much lighter. Plenty of room for the rear facing car seat, stroller, and a full week's worth of groceries. It's true that the MFD actually makes you a more "speed aware" driver. I don't see any speeding tickets in my future. I'm too busy trying to get 75+ mpg every 5 minutes. Highly recommend this car. Especially the touring edition. It definitely looks better than the base model.</TEXT>

It offered more than what I expected. I am averaging 51 MPG in suburban driving. The car engages you constantly, and actually encourages prudent driving.

I love the room it has, the ride, the handling and of course the outstanding gas mileage. I grin from ear to ear when filling up and figuring my gas mileage. I've been getting 52 MPG in 70% highway 30% city driving. I don't feel nearly as raped by the oil companies. I highly recommend the Prius. There's no reason this car couldn't be satisfactory for 80% of the population. </TEXT>

<TEXT>With the very first tankful of gas I achieved 51 mpg and have averaged in the low 50s ever since. The car is very comfortable, excellent storage space with the hatch back and folding rear seats. Every function of the car is done through the LCD screen with a constant readout of gas mileage so you know exactly how efficiently you are driving. During my research I had read that this car should be driven with the cruise control and that was correct. You can set it as low as 25 mph and adjust accordingly which eliminates the driver's ability to provide a constant gas pedal pressure. Not too heavy, not too light. Other cars love to zoom past me, but I always win at the gas station.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had my Prius for about 3 months. So far, I have averaged about 51 mpg highway and city combined. Sure beats my old car that got 23 mpg. It seems to get better mpg on just highway driving - about 55 mpg, In just city driving it is more like 45 mpg. Still very good, but not the 60 mpg that Toyota advertises.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Display screen that shows the actual mpg at any given moment. The back up camera for safety in backing up. The smart key is very convenient especially when your hand are full because you don't have to search for your keys to unlock the doors or put the key into the ignition.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>You don't need to be someone who thinks buying a hybrid is going to save the world to enjoy this car. I love it. People say it is the car of the future. Cars should all be like the Prius. I have driven mine for 3 months. It was still in the below 0 temperatures when I first got it in Feruary. I got about 40 mpg. Now that the temperature is 60-70 degrees, I get about 50 mpg. It is plenty big for my 8 month old, my wife, myself and all the attachments that go along for a long weekend. The trunk is big. My wife loves that it makes me a more conscious driver. Speeding kills mpg, so I slow down.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Reading my mpg on the display. Smart key with a baby is great. Competing with my wife to get better mileage. Telling people, "no you don't plug it in."

<TEXT>My biggest dissapointment with this car is gas mileage. Granted, I am averaging about 38 MPG, but nowhere near the stated 51 MPG. I could have bought a Chevy Aveo or Honda Fit for much less money. Quality is surprisingly poor - had to take car to dealer for leaks around the hatch area several times. Car is very uncomfortable for long trips- OK for jaunts around town. Seats are very hard and unsupportive. Performance is very iffy especially merging on freeways. When pressed too hard you get the feeling that the thing is about ready to break. Great second or third car, but not adequate for all- around duty. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is outstanding! It is very comfortable, surprisingly roomy, quiet, fun to drive, acceleration is more than adequate when needed, and the gas mileage is unbelieveable. I drive 50 miles each day for work and I'm averaging in the mid-50s. Don't listen to people who complain about their gas mileage. If you do not stomp on the gas pedal and drive it fairly conservatively, you'll be amazed. Cold weather will affect your average. Mine dropped to about 48 to 49, but in the grand scheme of things, that's still excellent. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just moved to El Paso. My work commute is about 60 miles round trip daily. Needless to say my old car was killing me. I read up on the Prius. I have read comments that they do not live up to the EPA standards of 51 and 60 mpg. I can tell you this, part of that is based on the type of area you drive and how you drive. Most people who are complaining about bad mileage numbers are not driving the prius to maximise the fuel economy. You need to use cruise control as much as possible. Set it for 55 mph to get the most mileage and still get where your going. Use "pulse and glide" in the city! </TEXT>

<TEXT>It is very unusual to find a car that you feel comfortable in the first day you start to drive it. The Prius is an exception. If you like advanced features like you may find expensive vehicles, and you want to be save money on fuel, the Prius is probably a good bet. I test drove the Prius and the Honda Civic. On my initial test drive, the Prius feels like a concept car. It is a little intimidating with all of the gadgets, displays, and unique things the Prius has. The Civic feels more like a normal car, but it does have the technological details the Prius does. In addition, the Civic depreciates in the real world much faster. The Prius is also much more fuel efficient. The Prius wins!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent gas mileage (46.2 avg off the showroom floor on day 1); very cool electronic features like the energy meter, and the voice recognition commands that operate more than the navigation. The backup camera on the 2007 model also is a great feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I average 44 mpg all the time and about 38 mpg with winter gas. I have got as high as 65 mpg. But 44 mpg seems to be the normal for normal driving (20% less than listed). The car is fun to drive but not for a very long trip. I drive it about 8 hrs everyday M-F, & the seats are not comfortable enough. I love the power up windows, cup holders, on board touch screen PC. I dislike the reverse back alarm, short leg room and the delay to shift into gear. I have noticed it lunges forward when the motor kicks in sometimes.

<TEXT>I drove this 07 for 4000 miles in Florida, then cross country to NM in late March. Averaged 51-52 mpg at sea level in mixed driving. Now 52-53 mpg at 7000 ft. altitude. I just learned something very interesting today. Toyota service rep. informed me that the car runs everything on electric. The gas engine is there only to recharge the battery! To maximize fuel economy, minimize gas engine operation. Accelerate rather quickly to operational speed and then drive with a light foot. Coast whenever possible. I love this car! My only negative is the inability to raise the driver's seat. My wife is 5'5" and cannot see nearly as well using the rear view mirror as I can.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Prius has turned out more than I expected. It is light and swift, and its smooth transitions between electric and fuel motors makes it really fun to drive, and the energy monitor makes it interesting to see how the car works. The mileage it gets is wonderful, with my initial tank at about 48 mpg to my 3rd tank at about 57 mpg, and that's highway/surface street combo driving. With the current gas prices, this car is worth every penny. People complained about the seat, but I haven't noticed it. Perhaps on longer trips? So if you are considering a hybrid at all, you won't be disappointed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Prius. My 04 had 97000 miles with the brakes never being replaced! Absolutely no trouble with that vehicle. Thus, the second purchase. Gas mileage - I average 51 mpg all around. My last trip to central Pa. I got 53 mpg on interstate driving - 70-75 mpg - put it on cruise. My first Prius was the same mileage. If people are getting low 40 mpg they need a sports car not a hybrid. The way you drive them will dictate your mileage!! On screen navigation will help you here. This one is better in the snow. I live in NW Pa. and we get a bunch. I love the smart key and the new back-up camera and reliability is superb! Resale value is excellent. I love filling up for less than 25 dollars. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I trade cars every 2 years and this was the first car I bought that I felt good about. The Prius is a techno machine that will have a gadget head reeling with all the simple yet sophisticated features. It reminds me of when I purchased my first iPod. It makes you wonder why other devices in the genre can't deliver upon your expectations. I enjoy not using a key in the traditonal sense via the SmartKey feature. The dynamic way the car displays its usage of energy has an effect on your driving style. You become smoother on the accelerator, which leads to greater fuel economy. Sure, I haven't hit 60 mpg avg. on a tank of gas, but 48 mpg is great. That's a 100% improvement over my old vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Get the Navigation with Bluetooth and everything will be controlled through the touch screen. Where you're going to, what you're listening to, who you're talking to, what temperature you're sitting in will all be controlled by the cenral touchscreen computer. Very cool and efficient.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just got a 2007 Prius. Back seats hard & bench like. Wouldn't recommend long drive for passengers in back of this car. Back seats fold down for extra storage, it's just right for my sweetie and me to take trips with all our gear, and fewer stops to refuel! Handles very well, fairly quiet, shift between the electric motor and gas engine not noticable at all, good pick up for passsing. Nice storage in 2 gloveboxes & center console. Holds 2 cups, large or small. Dash equip easy to read and operate, cruise control a bit awkward, under the right side of steering wheel. Overall, extremely happy with this car.</TEXT>

It seems to have plenty of pick-up when needed. I find driving the Prius to be a peaceful experience, much more relaxing than the internal combustion engine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I LOVE this car. Had it for over a week now, and it's averaging around 37 MPG. I'm in WI and we've had a lot of snow lately - it handled the slippery roads VERY well. No complaints. I have the extra stability control feature which may help for that as well. Drives very smoothly, pick-up from a stop is pretty decent. This car is so quiet sometimes you can hardly tell it's running. The "Power" button just floors me, so space age! Turning it on and shifting takes some getting used. Eventually you stop reaching for the key in the ignition. ;) Love the SmartKey feature. But be warned that a replacement key is $400.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This new Prius carried us through the south east of Arizona's mountains and deserts with a comfortable, efficient, and quiet weekend. New to us were the hybrid drive and the electronic technology. I'm old school where my transportation equipment is concerned. This car is an absolute pleasure to drive. Not as powerful as a 5 liter Mustang, not even close. The Honda civic that we traded in could not make the acceleration that I experienced merging onto I-10 in Benson, AZ. I had misjudged the traffic and opened the throttle. The gasoline and electric combination proved itself then. The electronic equipment calculates the mileage and was verified accurate at the pump at 52 mpg for the trip.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The entire vehicle is designed as a whole and not as some afterthought to get the fleet mileage up. To isolate the one favorite thing? The electronics. I'm a geek. There I said it. There is a lot of electrical wizardry going on and I am almost distracted by it. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I went from a '98 Chevy S-10 to a '07 Prius and have yet to have a real complaint. Don't care about image or stupid things like 0-60 in under 5 seconds, I'm just going from A to B and I like to throw a lot of things in the back like my old truck. I get about 50-51 mpg consistently (my wife is pedal heavy and she still gets 44 mpg at worst); so what if it doesn't hit EPA, no car does, and I'm still easily beating most cars at 50mpg. I would totally recommend this car to anyone who can afford it. The most basic Prius comes with many more features than most other cars so don't be tricked into thinking a basic hybrid is way more expensive than a basic Civic, compare it to something similar.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The digital monitor is great and if you pay attention to it, it forces you to drive better if you want the better mileage. The on-screen MPG is 98% accurate at worst. A lot of people talk about 30 mpg levels, I can't imagine how they are accomplishing that unless they drive totally insanely.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car is not made for anyone over 6'2, there is no leg room. On a long trip the car is impossible to get comfortable in. The car is dangerous in the snow. Even a small amount of snow causes the car to slide out of control when braking. On a snow covered hill if you have to stop the car will slide backwards because there is not enough transaction. Because of where the dashboard is located, at night there is a "green" glow on the windshield that is distracting and on darker roads the green glow will affect road vision. The rear camera for backing up is useless. There are blind spots. When passing a car on an interstate you need to constantly look over your shoulders.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, I have had this new 2007 Toyota Prius for exactly one month now and I have driven it 1400 miles. Some would say that isn't long enough to know much about a vehicle. I disagree. This is a very comfortable and quiet car; hence those miles were easy to drive. I am less fatigued than I would be if I drove the same 1400 miles in a Subaru or a Saturn. (I have owned many Subarus and one Saturn.) This car is so much fun to drive! It's the future, but now. I feel like I'm driving a car for the second millenium! I love that this car is so well thought out and safe. Toyota hasn't compromised much of anything as far as I can tell - plenty of power on the highway & great fuel economy wherever.</TEXT>

This is my first experience with Toyota and I'm loving it. I feel like it took a while but now I get it. Had to have the 50+ MPG - a political thing to be sure but I am sick of sending my hard earned bucks out of the USA and to big oil companies. I also believe that global warming is real and this car is really low emissions. This is a really well built fun to drive car -and a gadget freaks dream car. It's roomy, very quiet and really has nothing bothersome or disturbing at all. It's unique - in a class by itself. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas economy and less pollution. Very kool to be on full battery when moving around parking lot - feels like a golf cart. Cellphone on-screen display. Excellent. Roomy. Feels well built.

<TEXT>With Honda's decision to scrap the Insight, this is now the most fuel-efficient car, bar none, in the U.S. It's also well designed, comfortable (I'm 6'1") and, although it might take a bit of time to get used to the very different display and transmission, a blast to drive. Four adults can sit in the car with plenty of leg room, although the roof can be a bit low in the back for taller passengers, and it handles freeway speeds as well as any car I've ever driven. Note: If you have a lead-foot, are an aggressive driver, or expect sports-car performance, the Prius is not for you. If you enjoy 45-50 mpg overall, and can change some driving habits, I can think of no better vehicle - period. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My Touring Edition is still in the early ownership phase. Its current gas mileage is in the upper 30s with mostly city driving. I attribute this to a couple of factors: it's new, it's winter and cold, and winter blended gasahol dents the mileage. I love the handling. The interior room is OK but foot/leg position for the driver isn't quite right for me. Fit and finish are great which is typical for Toyota. Like other hybrids, there are some driving techniques which really boost the gas mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Backup camera, electronic stability control, air bags all around and handling are all big pluses. The Toyota keyless system is great.

I can drive in HOV lanes in NY without additional occupants under the Clean Pass program which is a major plus.

It performed flawlessly. I could go on but my ratings say it all except for this one item. When I pulled into my drive way, the fuel meter showed 48.2 mpg for the whole trip. WOW! With long distances at 80 mph.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought our new 2007 Prius two days ago. We were lucky, the person who ordered this car was a no-show. Car was on the lot for about an hour before we lucked out and found our new baby sitting there with its Seaside Pearl paint glistening in the sun. It has the level 5 option package. What a car! I haven't smiled this much in years. This car is so technologically advanced it makes other cars seem like ancient history. Its systems work so seemlessly, shifting back and forth from electric to gas and sometimes both, I am amazed. I am 6'3 and husky and I fit just fine, snug, but fine. Currently getting about 45-48 mpg overall, boy that's nice. I just smirk as I pass gas stations. Love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seemless drive system is amazing. Ride is very comfortable and quiet. Sound system is fantastic. Navagation system wasn't a requirement for me, but I must admit it's a kick in the pants to ask the computer where restaurants, etc. are and it shows you right there on the map. Wow! And its easy to use.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've got 23K miles on my 07 Prius now & love it. For those who say the MPG isn't as good as expected let me tell you that if you live in a cold climate that the winter MPG will drop nearly 10MPG. Your dealer will tell you that if you question your cold climate MPG. Reason is the gas motor needs to run more in cold weather to keep the batteries charged. I can tell you though that in normal warm weather (above 40 degress) that I get 48-50 MPG easily. Admittedly I drive for gas mileage---at the speed limit & no lead foot. After all that's why I bought the Prius, for optimum gas mileage. I love it & have put a deposit on a new 2010 model, which is newly designed bigger motor & even better MPG </TEXT>

<TEXT>When I first got my Prius I loved it. Now, a year and half later, I'm hating it. For the past 2 months I have had trouble with the headlights going out on me and I have had it not start for me several times. The dealership I took it to in Maryland said it would cost me $400 to replace one headlight. When I told them about the car not starting they said it must be my battery. Then when they looked at it they said the battery was fine. I went to start up the car two days later it wouldn't start. I didn't leave any lights on or anything that would drain the battery and who knows how much a new battery for this car will cost. When you buy a car it should at least hold up longer than 1 1/2 yrs</TEXT>

<TEXT>Maybe the big draw is the gas mileage, but once you get to know this car, it becomes a thing of beauty. Once you begin to understand that the lines were developed for efficiency, rather than trend, the smoothness of the hybrid drivetrain, the excellent handling (mine is the touring model) and the good feeling that you are making each drop of gas go as far as it can, you grow to see the beauty come through. Now, when I look at it, I see an utterly gorgeous machine. One that is more advanced than any BMW, Porsche or Mercedes. It's also very very useful. It can carry four passengers in comfort, carry 10 bags of cement without a problem and fit in 8' lumber.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I live in the mountains, but I still have a lifetime MPG of 50.7. Climate control is fantastic, stabilization control, tire pressure monitoring and 6 air bags, makes this car very safe. Hybrid-electric doesn't mean gutless. While you will sacrifice MPG for the moment, you can accelerate up a steep grade to 80 MPH + and keep up with anyone. No keys to mess with is great, just approach the car and cabin light up and the door opens, get in and go. This is truly a car ahead of its time. I've had -0- repairs or warranty work in nearly 2 years and 40,000 miles. I'm planning to buy a 2nd one.</TEXT>

We have been getting over 50 MPG lately but as low as 36 in winter with minus 20 temperatures and short trips of 6 miles to work and back. The back bumper cover didn't fit well both sides and glove box had to be replaced twice because of non uniform gap. Also one of my Goodyear tires had to be replaced at my expense. They said we abused the tire which was false. We have had this car a year now and we use it whenever we can and the Camry, which only gets 31, sits in the garage. The 15,000 mile service cost almost $200 which is a rip off</TEXT>

That's about 20% thruway/80% city and suburbs. Hard ride on 195/55/16s but comfortable and quiet. As usual it's very reliable and well-built. I'm sold on this one but look forward to the bigger, better 1.8.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Transmission is excellent and if you use appropriate hybrid techniques (accelerate briskly to your cruise speed then use very light pressure on the gas to maintain speed) you'll usually see 100 mpg on the gauge for long periods.

Unusually quiet as highway speeds. Just completed our first trip on interstate from NC to PA in I-81 and recorded mpg of 50+, we had averaged 43-44 mpg in combined travel. 50+ on the highway was not expected. Cons - driver seat cramped for tall drivers-2 inches more seat travel would do the trick. Bottom line - well worth the cost if you plan to keep for more than 4 years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed our Prius. It is comfortable, fun to drive and so far very reliable. I just wish Toyota or someone made a small pickup hybrid that got 40-50 mpg! We have tracked fuel economy and found that in the winter months we averaged 48 mpg and the rest of the year it is 52 mpg. That is 70% city driving and the rest is highway. The lower gas mileage during the winter is a combination of cold air AND winter gasoline formulation, which means that ALL gasoline cars gets less mpg in winter, not just the Prius.</TEXT>

When we were shopping for a hybrid, we also considered the Honda Civic Hybrid but ended up buying the Prius due to its interior room and extra gas mileage. Since buying the Prius in August, we have put over 13,000 miles on it. This car has been our primary vehicle replacing our need to drive our 4-Runner as much. Contrary to what many drivers think this little car does have fairly good pick up, We love watching the MPG surpass 51 but we have been averaging 47-49 MPG.

<TEXT>A great car with many good surprises. Only problems are with the manual, which is often useless; the front seat, which needs greater adjustability; and the steering wheel control lights, which are barely visible. We average in the mid 40s even in the Minnesota winter. The handling is excellent; very quiet cabin; almost parks itself; lots of room in the back and good cargo space. For those who complain about the back-up beep, it can be turned off via the screen input. Also, the green glow on the screen is easily eliminated by simply using the dimmer switch, which still allows plenty of illumination. All in all, a great car that leaves little to be desired.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my 2007 Prius since 2-28-07 and I am reasonably pleased with it. I have tried the pulse and glide method for more fuel economy and they work pretty well. My Prius is Barcelona Red and the paint is nice but chips very easily. I have gotten up to 53 M.P.G. using the Pulse and Glide method. It generally gets 50-52 M.P.G. between 65-75 on the highway during temperatures of 45-75F degrees. It seems that when the temperature dips so does the mileage to around 47M.P.G. in the colder months.</TEXT>

Love the direct input to stereo system. Climate control very well done. Purchased aftermarket leather supplied by dealer - much better than Toyota leather and did not have to buy Option 6 to get leather. Bought the Prius for my commute (48 miles each way) but my wife commandeered it for her commute (20 miles each way heavy city driving). I have a 2001 Accord V-6 and plan to trade it in and buy my own Prius. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Terrific car, as everyone says. Writing this mostly to contest the editor's comment that on the highway, when the battery is not being charged, the gas engine is "anemic." This is not true - it drives great at highway speeds. The editor's comment reflects a common misunderstanding of how hybrids work. The main reason fuel efficiency is so good is NOT due to regenerative braking or charging the battery at low speeds. It's because normally engines are sized for acceleration, and that wastes lots of gas when traveling at constant speed, even at 70 mph. With the Prius, the small engine cruises fine at 70 mph, and saves you lots of gas. For acceleratation, the electric motor kicks in - brilliant!</TEXT>

<TEXT>As a 14yr SUV-veteran, I had to face the fact that it was not long for the road. I thought of going for another SUV but I figured gas would be going through the roof and I needed a more economical vehicle for the frequent short trips I was now making. It took a few months for me to adjust to the change in height and performance of the Prius but the tradeoff has been worth it. It has a surprisingly smooth ride on the highway and doesn't feel like it's going 70 mph. Pickup from a stop is decent, maneuverability is good, not crazy about the backup alert, passenger room is comfortable for 4 people. My trips to the gas station have been cut in half compared with the SUV guzzler.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good gas mileage, about 45-50 mpg. Peppier pickup than my SUV. Smooth and quiet ride. So quiet, I had an offer for a jump when the engine was running on battery power - the guy thought I stalled out.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought this when gas reached $3/gal in Colorado - mainly for use around town. The Prius has turned out to be great for road trips too - adequate power and no problem keeping up with Interstate traffic at 75 - 80mph. With a little care we consistently get 50 - 55 mpg in town, 48 to 52 mpg on long trips. Only complaints are cheapness of interior (with Package 6 leather) and unattractiveness of shiny black plastic interior trim.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Prius for almost 4 months and love it more every day! Changing jobs brought a longer commute, but ability to drive in the HOV lane makes the commute almost painless. I laugh as I zoom by all those folks at a dead stop on the freeway. Gas mileage has also increased as I learned better driving techniques - now averaging about 50 mpg. Love the bluetooth and use it constantly - makes good use of the long drive and a much safer way to talk on the phone, plus its easy to use. Storage in the back is more roomy than it looks - all the junk I carried in my larger SUV fit with room to spare and the cover hides everything.

<TEXT>I went from a 2004 Pontiac Vibe to the 2007 Prius without thinking twice. This car is amazing. One month after purchasing the car, I took a road trip from Tampa, Fl to Toronto, Ontario. (That is about 3,000 miles there and back.) The cost for fuel both ways was $80.00. It was awesome to stop at gas stations to use the bathroom and not get gas. This car surely gets looks and many questions. I drove up for a family reunion and now many members of my family are in line for purchasing one. Also, when other Prius owners run into you, you have only great things to comment about. (I haven't met one with a bad comment!) On average I fill up every 2 weeks for about $25.00 each fill up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased my Blue 2007 Prius Touring a few weeks ago and have been very happy with it. You do have to work on driving habits to maximize fuel economy but the results are great. I have a short commute that is uphill in the mornings. I average about 38 mpg on the way there. On the way back I have gotten as high as 77 mpg though! I just completed 30 miles of errands and averaged 57.5. My last car was a 1997 VW GTI. It has been a big upgrade in terms of interior build quality. The fit and finish is superb. I have not had any rattles and the ride is much more solid than my VW. I have had not problems with handling and it feels very stable on the highway. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a Lexus RX 300 for the Prius, mostly for better gas mileage. Was shopping Camry Hybrid against Prius, but went with Prius as a better overall value, plus I actually like the hatchback design. While the car isn't as comfortable as a Lexus, or as quiet, it still is very nice and I don't find myself missing my old car at all (well almost). Many complain about the seats in the Prius, but for me they are fine, plenty comfortable and supportive. It also was really nice filling up for the first time after 400 miles and it only cost $24! Even my husband was sold after we drove it home getting 55 mpg on the highway right off the lot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car to use as my commuter vehicle into NYC from New Jersey every day. It was all about fuel economy. After using it, my whole family prefers to take the Prius on trips rather than a larger, less economical car because of the room and the ride. I am considering getting rid of that to get my wife a Prius. My fuel economy is less than I expected, but still better than any other car my 6'3" frame would fit in, at an average of 44 mpg in mostly stop and go driving. I have gotten as good as 52 mpg though with "regular" driving. I have not had any problems with this vehicle, so I can't complain on that front. All in all this car is a winner!</TEXT>

Having driving a Honda Insight for a year and being very happy with its performance I looked a the Prius for better comfort and I must say I got it. While gas mileage is not as good (at about 53 avg) as the Insight (60.5 avg)I have been very pleased with the smooth and quiet ride. The many accessories like Blue Tooth for my cell phone, iPod speaker connnection, and excellent stereo system performance have met all my exacting expectations. The Touring Edition suspension and beefy tires have performed well for this tall car by keeping it flat when negotiating the tight turns on the roads I travel.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just after purchase I decided to take a long summer car camping trip from DC through the Rockies (NM to MT), then over to the Sierras and down to LA, then back to DC. 13,000 miles in 7 weeks. Though the Prius isn't optimized for long highway trips, it did very well. 65 mph on cruise yielded 50-52 mpg, 70-75 mph yielded 46- 49 mpg. Hills and mountains hurt mileage. My worst tank was 44 mpg when I had many long steady climbs but the car had more than enough power to climb Slumgullion Pass in Colorado (11,900 feet) without struggling. The steering is a little numb. The car handles okay in curves but isn't agile. Very stable and little affected by wind. Hatchback takes tons of gear easily.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We did a lot of research before purchasing and our patience was thoroughly rewarded. Trading in a Dodge Durango that got 13.7 miles per gallon will save us almost $13000 in fuel costs alone in the next 5 years based on $3.20/gal. The car has been everything expected and more. We are amazed at not only it's mpg (averaging about 49) but its overall comfort and affordability as well. It has numerous qualities including good handling, low noise level, smooth ride (at least compared to our ex-Durango), good rear seat leg room and good performance for a small car. It won't beat a Viper off the line but the 40 to 60 acceleration is amazingly good. Overall, an excellent choice for us. </TEXT>

I went back to the dealership and hugged my salesman. I told him that the first week I owned it I counted over 50 miles to the gallon. I couldn't believe it. Stopping at red lights used to really bother me because I thought that I was wasting so much gas and now when the electricity kicks in it is no problem. I just sit and laugh at the poor guys out there losing money. I also find that it can be so quiet. I really like the insturment panel that offers so many choices. Especially the one for climate.

I read the reviews and now I understand what people were saying about making a game of how much mileage you can squeeze out. The car is also very cute and the gadgets are great - love the bluetooth and navigation. So far everything has been easy to figure out and set up, although the books are basically useless.

On the motorway with rolling 40-70 mph traffic I get 60 mpg+, urban consumption is around 58 mpg and at constant 70 mph gets me 52 mpg. If there is anyone getting less than 50 mpg then either the car has a fault or they are not using the "float" method, i.e. very little pressure on the accelerator to keep the car spinning along at the same speed. Ever so quiet engine and with the ECVT drive it gives a very smooth ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Touring model has good handling (little body lean on turns) and is fun to drive. However, it rides much like an economy car (a bit road noisy and you can definitely feel bumps, RR tracks, etc.) Some interior materials feel cheap esp. fabric and plastic dash/doors. However, there is a lot of cool technology way ahead of the average car. It gets very good mileage, avg. 44, best 50.1. We drive 400 miles on a tank and all fill-ups have been UNDER $30 even w/CA gas prices up to $3.29 gal - ouch!. It also has very good power for small HP engine. Goes up highway hills with no problem, but works hard going up lower speed mountain roads. Next time would buy Touring model w/o any pkg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a 1998 Mercedes Benz ML320 for the 2007 Prius Touring edition in Seaside Pearl blue. (Touring has a bigger spoiler, bigger tires and tuned suspension.) I couldn't be happier! Fun to drive, has more pick up than I expected, very comfortable and reliable and, of course, the legendary gas mileage. All my friends made fun of it before they rode in it. Now they love it. I personally like the way it looks and drives. I had mine equipped with leather seats, navigation system, back up camera, JBL audio and Bluetooth. I love the fact that I'm reducing my carbon footprint as they say, especially important here in smoggy southern California. Overall, great car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Awesome gas mileage, good acceleration, body style, color, comfort, reliability, sound system, high tech features like touch screen monitor, back up camera and Bluetooth. And did I mention the gas mileage?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car as a third vehichle for myself- basically to run back and forth to work in and for errands. I certainly did not buy it for its looks going in, but for fuel economy. This car did not deliver as advertised. I am averaging about 35 MPG highway/city driving- not the 50 MPG+ as advertised. I feel sorry for those who have this car as a primary vehichle- it is very uncomfortable after 1/2 hour- seats are hard and headroom is poor. The car is very slow merging on the freeway and keeping up with traffic. Very noisy at speeds of 60 MPH plus The "check engine" light came on, but dealer could not find anything wrong. This is a good car for a teenager or for short trips only.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Surprising power in the mountains for such a small car. Very comfortable too. The basic sound system was also better quality than we expected. Our video gamer teenage son loves driving it to see how much better he can do on gas mileage than his parents. Overall, so far, we are really happy with our purchase and would recommend it to anyone.</TEXT>
