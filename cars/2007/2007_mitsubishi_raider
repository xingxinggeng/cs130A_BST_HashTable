<TEXT>Just bought the truck. Was looking for value, and found it in this truck. Original MSRP was $29.5K, but I bought mine for $13.2K, with only 21,000 miles on the odo. Lucky to have found this one. Used Dakotas are selling for more. I guess not too many are aware of this truck. If you're in the market for a Dakota, definitely look at the Mitsu. It's the same truck underneath. By the way, checking the internet is the way to go. My truck was stickered on the lot for $17.9K.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good power with the V8, comfortable, smooth ride, handles real nice for a truck, E-85 fuel option.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Was looking for a Dakota but like others did not like the new front end. After looking at other mid size trucks and comparing the prices decide to go with this one. Love the V-8 and get the same mpg as a V-6 is great. Has good power and the truck rides great. Interior is comfortable and the kids love all the room they have in the back. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V-8, styling, comfort, and ride. Glad I am one of the lucky few who the V-8.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the 2007 truck one year ago. I have never regretted it. What attracted me to this truck was the value. I compared all other 4 door trucks - none came close to the price. The nearest truck in its class was $8k more. Other than the Sirius radio, nothing fancy. Good fit and finish. Cloth seats are comfortable. Smooth and quiet ride. The low gear ratio gives it a gutsy feel. The 6 cylinders make the engine responsive - not enough to burn rubber, but confident to pass on the highway. The only downside is the gas mileage - not bad, but not good either. I average around 16-17 in the city and about 18-20 on the highway. Overall, I'm very happy with the performance. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sirius radio, solid ride, low gear ratio, fit and finish.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've now owned my Raider for 7 months now & still dread the day I purchased it. The look & style caught my attention as well as the price, but don't get e wrong looks aren't everything. The truck is durable from impact don't get me wrong, I was in a big car accident, & even through the crash was big, my car came out the barely damaged. On the other hand the other suv was a total loss. Performance is what lacks mostly. Worst truck to go to the mountains. Going uphill took a lot of power & a full tank of gas, as well on the freeway the truck takes a long time to get to the speed limit & a struggle to maintain. The only faults on interior is that the center console tend to break easily.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The features I found to really catch my eyes is the sleek frame design, as well as the extra space it provides.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I found out that Mits was bringing back the truck I was ecstatic. I have had mine for 9 months and I love everything about it. The Handling is awesome especially on curves. When I drive it if feels like a truck but it has the comfort of a car. The stereo system is among the best for standard equipment, mine came with free satellite radio for a year. The manufactures warranty is also among the best in the market. My kids and I love the room inside the double cab. We have taken it to the coast several times and have has lost of fun. The only thing I would trade is the MPG but hey, it?s a truck. If you are thinking about getting a truck take a look at the Raider.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely love the Mitsu. I have had it 7 months and already have over 12,000 on the odo. I haul my boat and trailer with ease and haul cargo around pretty nimbly. It is a great truck to work in or style in, especially if you don't want the hassle of trying to drive around and park in a full size pickup.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My truck is sharp and loaded! The SE has a nice equipment package. Sorry no leather interior or heated seats. It's cool Mitsu stylin inside and out. The SE Value Package has the 6500 lb towing capacity I need for my trailer and the right blend of interior power/comfort/electronics features inside for my daily commute. If you need a big but nimble midsize to tow with and were waiting for the right price like I was, find a Raider SE.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sharpest exterior styling out there in midsize truck class. Class IV hitch, 4.7 V8. 6500LB towing capacity! Limited slip differential, tranny cooler, oversized radiator, Power interior controls, Nice seats, brushed aluminum trim augments interior retro space age design. Very well designed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The last truck I owned was a 1997 Dodge Dakota. I was in the market to buy one again, the size always seemed perfect, but I don't like the styling of the new Dakota. So I took a look at the Raider, which is its structural twin, even assembled at the same plant. The handling has been improved vastly, and the new version is even lighter then my previous. 1997 Dakota weighed in at 5,480 lbs w/ V-8 & std. cab and Raider is 4,287 lbs w/ V-6 and extended cab. Being 1,200 lbs lighter and only 20 HP short of my last, it accelerated very nice, and the economy is better, although like all of us I'd like to see it a little better. Maybe they can bring the 5-speed auto to the V-6 next year.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling by far is better then the new one or my '97 Dakokta. Interior very comfortable and I love the standard outside temp gauge. Sirius radio w/ 6 months for free is great. Not too many on the road, so it's nice to stand out and you can get these for a great price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned my 2007 Raider since Jan of 07. I love it, trans. a little rough, brakes a little shaky. Those are my only complaints, oh and fuel mileage. For the price and having it loaded with extras I can't complain too much. I compare it to Toyota as that's all I would own other than Mits. for truck purposes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love that it's 4dr with lots of space, has a bedliner and satellite radio.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Raider a lot! I don't agree with how some reviews mention 'cheap' plastic. This truck is very solid in its build. I love the sound system, the handling, and it definitely has a lot of power. I am in love with my Raider as well! All that I wish is that gas prices would go down! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling like a car, power, is equipped with Sirius radio! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>To anyone out there who is not sure about the Raider...I am a believer in it! I have come across a few bad reports of Raiders but for me, overall it's the baddest truck on my block for sure! It has handsome styling, a smooth ride, and a nice sound system. It's everything that I was looking for and the price was decent for me also. I got it for $23,000 with a lot of extras on it. So far I am definitely in love with it, and I hope others feel the same way. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Just the style alone...rugged yet sophisticated</FAVORITE>
