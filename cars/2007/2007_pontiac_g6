<TEXT>original owner, intermediat steering shaft,brakes and now in shop for intake gasket leaking oil. It's all covered but would be Pist if I had to pay out of pocket. Dealer set me up with a rental car and less than 1 day to fix each time. I like the car and handles good with good power. The 6 speeds are way over rated I have 4sp A/T and have logged 32MPG loaded down on our trip to Canada with A/C cranking (72MPH). All vehicles have issue just look them up. I work for import car company and they also have issues some worse some better. MPG on the imports are about the same give/take. With demand for MPG 8 speeds,dual clutch and more CVT transmisisons. Little improvement, heavy and big $$$$</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 06 ford explorer off for a g6 because I started to get too high off mileage on my explorer and I needed something that got better gas mileage. I liked the way it looked on the outside. The inside wasn't bad at first and it drove alright. Within the first month it was in the shop three times for rotors, brake pads and steering column problems. Now, the silver trim is peeling off. It looked cheap on the inside to begin with but now looks even cheaper.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is spacious, has some get up and it still looks ok from teh outside.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Car seems to have gotten worse with more miles. I now have almost 29,000 miles and I've already had to replace the brakes, turn rotors, AC stopped blowing recently, numerous alignment and tire issues, needed to get the steering column lubed (now it's starting to make noise again), had to have passenger side airbag sensor replaced once and serviced two other times. Unfortunately it feels like the reliability is not there. It feels like the more miles I get on the car the more things go out. Car handles well and cruises real nice at high speeds on interstate. I feel like Pontiac just threw this car together real quick. I will shop around more next time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like my 2007 2.4l g6 it drives well and I bought it new. At 23,000 miles I didn't have to do any Major repairs. I have noticed that when you turn and take off fast there is a "clunking" noise that is starting to annoy me. I have called the dealer and they said it must be because of the speed I'm taking off at but that's not true.</TEXT>

I agree with other people about the interior plastic type pieces being cheap. Other than the cheap plastic pieces it's an overall good car. The trunk space is amazing!!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car in February '09 after trading in my '03 Chevy Impala. I'm very impressed with it so far. It had 35,000 miles on it due to it being a rental car, yet I haven't had any problems at all. It drives great and looks awesome. I've had GM vehicles for the past 5 years and haven't had any major problems with any of them. Now if only Ford could do the same. lol!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car was a piece of junk!!! I bought this car with only 28,000 mi. The car came with its original bumper to bumper warranty. At 29,000 mi I had grinding in my steering wheel 36,000 mi everything really went to heck. My steering wheel once again stared making the grinding sound again. The car started to loose its power and the car started to get horrible on gas. By the time I traded it in I fill up at least 4 and to some time 4 times a week. At 38,000 I had to replace the brakes and let me tell you it like rocket science to replace those brakes. At 40,000 my struts were out and it was going to cost me 1200 to get them replaced. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased 4/07. Wheel bearing replaced at 12,000 miles. Now at 20,000 back in the shop for "clunking" in the steering. Car will not stay aligned, constantly fighting the steering wheel (aligned 4 times). On the positive side, looks good, 3.5 engine runs well. I bought the sports package, maybe that is the problem. Will still buy American, probably not GM. </TEXT>

<TEXT>For all of you who have wrote bad reviews about the car, you must not know how to drive. Ive drove my 07 G6 115,000mi in two years. The only two problems I had were dirty fuel injectors and the cadilac convertor was replaced. Finally, after 115,000 the struts are starting to go bad but thats because of all the pot holes. The car runs great, looks great, handles great and im thinking about upgrading to an 09. If you have break problems with only 10,000mi maybe your slamming on the brakes too much and overheating the rotors...</TEXT>

<TEXT>Aside from an annoying clicking in the front windows, this auto has been awesome. It took the dealer three attempts to quiet the clicking, rattling window noise. It only happened with the windows all the way up, and was fixed with an adjustment to the top closure which was covered in a manufacturer's bulletin. This car is fun to drive and is truly like having two cars in one with the retractable hard top. Gas mileage is excellent given the performance level.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a very attractive car. It feels comfortable and sporty and with some exceptions has very nice interior. I think many of the issues with the earlier years have been sorted out. Too early to tell about reliability. My example has several interior rattles. The engine feels very powerful and the car handles well but it falls short of really being a "sports" coupe. I have the sport package on mine which includes the 3.5L LZ4 and hydraulic PS which probably resolved previous handling complaints. I probably can't complain about the mileage (28 MPG in commuter service) but I still will. Stiff suspension transmits considerable road noise to the cabin, ride is OK though.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powerful, smooth and refined drive train. Great exterior styling. Quiet on smooth roads. Comfortable and roomy interior and trunk. I like the sound system and DIC. Standard sunroof is very nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great car, I'm impressed and surprised. Great riding, strong V6, nice clean appearance, and very roomy. Wide wheel base makes this thing turn like a boat. Console and shifter area kinda awkward. Too close together. Not enough storage. Small trunk opening. Sharp looking, I guess the people that stole my factory wheels thought so too. (Get wheel locks.) My wife was avid about not getting this (or Pontiac in general), had to give her her own set of keys. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been looking for a HT/convertible since owning the Ford Sunliner. This car is so much fun to drive and I stole it from the dealer. It is fun to drive and great with the top down. Had a rag top and you guessed it, the top got cut and it rotted. So much for rag tops. Now I am so happy with my convertible and if it turns out to be lemon I don't care. I will love it anyway. My son and I love it and now he wants me to buy him one. The top movement is so smooth and no problems like the Sunliner had. Tubes/switches bad</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The smooth operation of the top. The 6 disk/8 speaker stereo as my son blasts me out of the car. Kids like it loud as I remember when I was young. The holding of the top button is for safety in case someone gets in the way and you know someone will. So much fun to drive </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My G6 is less than a month old with only 500 miles, but I love it so far. It's truly a great value. I think it looks and drives great. I'm impressed with the driver information center. I'm a little disappointed in the center console. It's roomy, but doesn't have a compartment for coins (minor flaw). Also, I was surprised that the car does not have ABS brakes, although it does have 4 wheel disc brakes. I also assumed that the radio would have the song information (I forget what it's called but our 2001 Sunfire radio has it). I wish it had remote keyless entry, but this is something that I will add later and I think is reasonably priced. I'm sure adding these would increase price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I shopped around for a new car for a year, and had always considered the G6 sedan until I had the salesman showed me the convertible. All it took was looking at that sporty coupe turn into a great looking convertible with the push of a button and I knew what would be in my driveway! I love having two cars in one!! When the top's up, you can't even tell it's a convertible, inside or out. It looks great going down the road, and then I put the top down and you know that everyone is looking at it, whether they want to or not. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow! I got the G6 GT Convert w/the 3.9 V6 Sport & Premium Pkg, adjust pedals, side bags, the works. I am a big man (300+ 6'1") and still fit well in this car. When the top is down, I am even comfortable in the back seat. My wife is much shorter and with the adjust pedals and tilt tele steering wheel, finds a comfortable position too. The ride and handling are great. I drive a daily round trip commute of 70 miles and this car works fine. Turn off the traction control, stomp the gas and you burn the tires but this is a cruiser, not a dragster. I don't have a garage and didn't think a cloth top would wear well. A steel top was my only option and Pontiac has delivered! I love this car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature is the standard admiring looks one receives on a sunny day driving through town with the top down. Nice styling. A hard top that when up, provides a much quieter ride and I hope will make my car a regular coupe this winter when the temperature drops.</FAVORITE>

I have friends who always say they dislike American cars but they sit and ride in the G6 and they change their mind. Panoramic sunroof is real nice, it?s huge! I haven?t any problems with it in 6 months. Besides gas mileage and few minor things it?s a great buy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really didn't expect such a great vehicle. I've been a high volume fleet and internet manager for my Pontiac dealer for a long time, but honestly I never thought I'd personally buy a G6, but it came time to buy a house and I wanted room in the budget, so I got rid of my loaded up Sierra truck and got this G6. It is a great riding car, great build quality, powerful, I am really surprised. I've had Pontiacs in the past and never cared for them. I think theyve stepped up a notch and are a great value. I highly recommend the G6 if you want a great vehicle for your money</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first new car, although this car is technically a used vehicle. I bought it with 12,500 miles on the odometer. Overall GM has done a good job with this vehicle. For the price I couldn't have gotten a better more stylish '07 midsize vehicle. $15,000 altogether and I have the V6, 17in alloys, and lip spoiler. I'm only 20yrs so I feel the design does a good job of apealing to a younger generation. Although I love my car a few things can be improved. I'm not a big fan of the hydraulic assisted steering, not sporty at all, not even as good as the '07 Carmy and that's not perfect either. GM cheaped out on the interior a little but thats nothing new. Ride quility is good though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the most fun car we've ever driven! Push one button and you go from hard top to convertible - no latches to loosen or canvas covers to snap in place - the top automatically folds into the trunk in about 30 seconds. Most convertibles are quite noisy with the top up (only canvas between you and road noise) but this car is as quiet as any sedan when the top's up. Can't wait to tow it behind an RV and enjoy the vacation scenery from a vantage point only a convertible can provide. I have a Bluetooth phone which I can use when the top's down. There is hardly any wind noise in the front seat. </TEXT>

There is no trunk left. My car was totaled. The police officer said that the car did its job and that he would recommend getting another. My son's car seat was intact (he wasn't in the car). There was glass all over the back seat. However, the impact stopped at the back seat. I plan on buying one again. Hopefully this one lasts longer than 20 days.</TEXT>

I'm very pleased with the options the car came with for the money. I wanted a new car and didn't want to spend a fortune for one. To make a long story short, for the money, this is the best built, best performing, most comfortable car I've ever owned. Pontiac you have made me a happy man.....so far.

<TEXT>The key selling point was the price; after rebates, auto show cash, and GM employee discount the cost of my G6 couldn't be passed up. I live in the Chicagoland area and purchased this car for summer time use only. After breaking in the engine, I took this car on a 1,500 mile, 5 day, 5 state road trip to the Smoky Mountains N.P. This car was a blast to drive on the interstate. With the top down, conversation can easily be made even when traveling 80-90 mph. With a large displacement of the 3.9L engine maneuvering through traffic was a breeze although this car could really benefit from a 5th and even a 6th gear, because it only returned 23.5 mpg on this particular trip.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My dealer located the car I wanted, granite grey with ebony-morocco interior...sharp! The day I drove it off the lot though, the roof rattled loudly and didn't retract. I returned it immediately and I have to give the dealer credit. They apologized profusely, gave me a loaner, and repaired/adjusted everything in a few days. On top of that, the dealer worked w the Pontiac factory rep and extended my bumper to bumper warranty from 36K to 60K and even picked up the cost of the rubber mats I had ordered. The car is now totally rattle free and rides much smoother than I had expected and is quite quiet. Power is adequate and mpg is livable. (I'm used to an 350 hp Accord with 29 mpg).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Roof, of course. Remote start, XM Radio, adjustable pedals and the fantastic looking two tone leather seats. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The G6 handles nice and smooth, it is a very good car for the price. the interior is user friendly, the stereo is loud and clear. it does not scratch the cds when used. The fuel economy is very good i went to philadelphia with a stop off at atlantic city which is about 300 miles approximately one one tank of gas with some to spear, also one half a tank back to brooklyn. i recommend this car to anyone, it is much better than my last 3 cars put together. the insurance rate for the vehicle is alot cheaper then some other vehicles as well. it handles solid in the snow, it does not slid even without stability and traction control. go for a test drive you will not be disappointed.</TEXT>

When i first sat in the car for the test drive and stepped on the gas i thought to myself " i have to have this car. The roomy bucket seats and the nice and smooth ride left me speechless and comfort should be defined as Pontiac g6.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Expecting Pontiac to try and fill in the hole that the Trans AM left and what the fake GTO left, i thought the G6 would be the little performer for Pontiac...boy was i disappointed. The car sounds lighter than a V4, has no grunt in the motor and well...how can Pontiac name this a "GT" unless there's a meaning of GT i am not aware of. In all honesty, people out there who are looking for a REAL American Muscle car and weren't fooled by the GTO (Holden Monro) or the new G8 (same as GTO) just wait for the 09 Camaro and bug Pontiac to make a similar car and call it a Trans AM.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car! Considered the Solstice at first, but was more impressed with the hardtop option on G6. Decent interior, best to opt for Sport Package for quicker 3.9 V6. Quiet with top up, good looks with top up or down. Great visibility, minimal blind spots. Looks far better in person than online pics.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Monsoon radio sounds great, heated seats work well, auto climate control with premium package is great. Peppy 3.9L V6. Easily accessible buttons/switches, and of course the convertible top.

I am only five ft. tall and the adjustable pedals and seat are great for me. I also have the 17 inch tires.The ride is smooth and for a 4 cyl. the pick up is great. Every time my husband drives it he comments on the power. I also find this car to be very easy to park. I love everything about this car. My daughter drove it and also loved it. This comes from someone who buys a new car every three years. I hope to have this car awhile. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought my new G6 with the 1-SV package. The price was GOOD (under $15K) and it's fun to drive. I like the gas mileage (30), size (not too big, not too small), look (SHARP), and handling (smooth and responsive). I don't like the driver's seat (too narrow) and the missing features (no cruise control or remote locks). Also the sun visor mirror has plastic covers where the lights should be (looks cheap).</TEXT>

<TEXT>For the price I found this car to be a pretty solid purchase. I opted for the 3.9 liter engine with the 6-speed manual, and the premium package. I love the way the car looks and handles, and am also positively impressed with the build quality. I am a little disappointed that the 6 disc in-dash changer is not mp3 compatible, and I'm also not a very big fan of the front cup holder location. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and get a smile on my face whenever I drive it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The leather seats look very sharp, and the monsoon sound system provides a quality auditory experience. I also appreciate the prodigious amounts of powered offered by the engine.

<TEXT>I had the the G6 GTP for two months and its been fun. Have been a big Pontiac owner for two previous vehicles (98 Bonneville and 02 Montana) and have seen a noticeable improvement in overall quality. Fit and finish are excellent. GTP has plenty of HP for the road warrior. The layout of the dashboard and controls are perfect, although I would have preferred to have the information center in the instrument cluster rather than on the radio display. The adjustable pedals are nice so that my wife doesn't need to change the seat position. I have also notice that the headlights, although bright, don't seem to project as far. I'm still waiting to see how it handles in the snow.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only owned this car for about a week now. I researched and drooled over it for 2 years, and finally took the plunge to buy it. This car is great! The whole car is beautiful, love the comfort of the seats and LOVE the panoramic sunroof. No awful wind noise at all. The 2-toned leather interior is luxurious, and the seats fit larger people comfortably. Shifting on the auto tranny is smooth and barely noticeable, and the engine has plenty of pep in its step! Great interior space; trunk is very big and back seat has plenty of legroom for our 4 year old in his booster seat. Overall fit and finish of the car is fantastic. I highly recommend to any small family not looking for an SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Started out to buy a rational vehicle, since I already own a high performance roadster--(1991 RX7 convertible). My husband declared the Civic and Mazda 3 boring. I suggested a 4 seat convertible. We chose a hardtop so we'd have a car to leave at the airport without worrying. I'm really pleased. It's not a sports car, or all that high performance, but it is fun. Handling is very good for a car its size and the back seat roomy enough for adults. With this car, I can have my top down and pick up the kids, take the dog to the vet, etc. Charlie Brown once said the key to happiness is to own a lake and a convertible. Convertible = fun. Now I drive one almost every day! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The folding hardtop. Absolutely. Like the red gauges, too. Great styling. The price/features ratio was very nice. The Volvo costs almost 50% more. The Eos costs more and the back seat is very minimal.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Under $30k with all the options, including the bigger engine. Try that in a Solara or a Eos, or a BMW....all of which were considerations for me. The Pontiac guys are so hungry they give these away at invoice, less rebates. I like the 100,000 mile warranty.. The car is zippy around town, quiet on the freeway, and there is plenty of room for two in the back seat. I have had better cars, but none for under $50k.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It seems like this will be a good car. I'm typically a Mopar guy, but the fact that this is one of the few sedans with a V6/manual transmission is the reason I bought it. Only complaints are the gas mileage is lower than expected (19.5 city), but hopefully it'll improve as the engine breaks in and the interior scuffs easily. Not impressed with XM radio, my friend's Sirius seems much better. The car is comfortable, rides smooth, and fairly quit. Over all pretty solid.</TEXT>

We feel safe because of the Stability Control System and the side impact air bags. The 8 speaker Monsoon system sounds great with controls on the steering wheel. We love the fact that it's a hard top in the winter. Everyone we see wants one including our daughter who is out looking for one now. It draws looks everywhere we go especially when putting the top up or down. We are getting 3 miles per gallon over what the sticker said and the price was under 30K. Can't beat it. </TEXT>

Power is adequate, the car is heavy at 3800 lbs, has good ride with minimal body shake and seats are very comfortable. The car is extremely quiet with the top up and with the top down conversations can be had without yelling. The car is gorgeous with the top down and looks just like the coupe with the top up.

<TEXT>I've loved the Lexus SC but felt $65,000 out of my price range for what I wanted. Security and wondering if and when someone would cut a hole in the top was my hold back on a convertible and having it for winter. Just happened to see a G6 in a parking lot and checked it out on line and found a car for $31000 that did just what I needed. It really needs a place to lock items in when parked and one touch button top operation would be great. Liked the electric blue but found it was only available in 06 and put out the blue gold which I don't care for color wise. Odd they made the prototype electric blue and cancel the color for 07. I love the car anyway.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hard top convertible for $31000 and a great ride with little wind noise even with top down.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned the car for a few weeks now and everything seems to be fine. I do a lot of Highway driving so gas mileage has been good just like my previous car and it is more comfortable that my Toyota Camry which I found extremely surprising. As far as the interior it looks like cheap plastic but like most other cars in the same class and I am not rough on my cars so it should last a long time. If you live in a hot & sunny area I would suggest buying an $8 magic sun-shade due to the fact the dash board is Foam like plastic and you would not want your dashboard to crack. Other than that I am pretty impressed for this is my first brand new car I have ever owned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Obviously the hard top is the most attractive since I have family that isn?t in the best neighborhoods. The remote starter system is great and for those cool nights my wife loves the heated seats. From a safety perspective I love the rearview from the back window unlike most other convertibles.</FAVORITE>

It has been over 100 degrees this summer, and yet even with the top down, I can feel the AC....The look is great, and the fun doesn't stop...I hvae the GTP with the bigger engine, and it has plenty of get up and go - sacrificing some MPG in the process</TEXT>

<TEXT>As the owner of an older Ford Mustang convertible, it is so nice to not be worried about having to replace the top every 5-7 years. The interior is amazingly roomy nad safe . We have three kids and the back seat will comfortable seat tehm as they get older (the 11 yr old boys are not much shorter than my average height wife) and the front seat is real safe with the dual stage air bag (one heck of an improvement over two pint seat belt and no air bags in the older car). It's also quiet and comfortable with the top down! Heated seats are a great way to increase top-down time in the Fall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love driving my new G6 convertible it has great pickup. it's fun to drive, i can talk on my cell phone with the top down and hear perfectly clearly. The wind resistance is awesome. i think it has to do with the front windshield..i was also surprised at the truck space with even with the top down. i love that it is a hard top, it maykes all the difference, even with the top of it has a ton of room inside back and front and its very stylish </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car 3/2008 used with 29000 miles but I am starting to worry about problems. My trip odometers reset on their own and a few months ago I noticed rotten egg smell and it started to guzzle gas like no tomorrow (I have to get gas 2x/week when I used to 1x/wk). Burning smell/rotten egg smell with hard acceleration. Sunroof squeaks and interior side panel rattles. However, I do enjoy driving fast and keeping up with all the other "racers" out on the road. But the longer I drive, the slower the car seems to accelerate. Overall its a nice fun car to drive, but doesnt seem as reliable as it should be. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My base 3.5L v6 sedan, pretty well optioned. Owned Camaros before this. Loved the looks, safety, options for the price. MSRP $21,800, paid $16,500 before tax with haggling and incentives. I have had it for 1.5 years and ~25,000 miles, No issues. Not sure everyones issue with fuel, being a base I have a 3.05 final drive, maybe that helps but I see 22- 24 city, and 28-32 logged and calculated by hand. Not bad for a midsized car, that is roomy enough for my 6'5" guy. Yet still has some enough power to actually pass people with ease on the road. Is the interior top of the line? No, but its not bad. Its plastic and fake leather, like every other car under $30k. Cheap/fast/economic</TEXT>

<TEXT>Don't get me wrong I love this car for some reason mostly cause of the looks! but I'm a car guy so I can't ignore the fact that this car is mediocre. Its leaps and bounds better than the grand am, but If you consider other cars in this class it is not on there level in refinement. suspension noise is too pronounced and is a bit underdamped. the car is not agile at all and drives big, although the steering is good. The stock stereo is crap and if you get an aftermaket unit you lose the trip computer big flaw. this car makes too many noises which effects the perception of quality. That said the car is sold it just does its job and nothing more, its like a Gap model with a personality flaw. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It is such a shame that this car is so awful, I love this car, but it is a rolling junk heap. It looks great, and it is a good thing that the monsoon stereo is awesome, b/c it drowns out alot of the popping and cracking the car makes, from the dash to the, rear end to the steering column, to the sunroof, oh my at the noises!!! I am so disappointed, I need to trade it in, but I can't b/c I am so upside down in the payment. Dealerships and GM do nothing to resolve issues. I really love the car but it has so many problems, gas smell inside, stalling out, back firing, everything rattles, brakes, rotors, you name it. I have always driven Chevy's and love them, I will never own another Pontiac!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car in February 2008. At first it was in the shop monthly for various electrical problems. We finally found that it was an O2 sensor. Now that it's fixed the car is much better. The looks are great and the performance is even better. This is a very fun car to drive and you will get compliments on how nice it looks. I have the GT coupe with heated leather seats, a welcome amenity in the winter. It is a very fast little car hindered some by the TCS (Traction Control System). Other than that, though, If you are tired of Civics passing American cars, buy this car! It can smoke a V8 Chevy truck. It is also pretty comfortable considering the small exterior stature.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely hate my G6 GT coupe. After 6 months the interior vanity light went out and the brakes started squeeking. I went in for an oil change and had the guy look at my brakes. I am currently at 32K miles. Apparently all my brake pads are shot and all my rotors need to be machined. For such an aerodynamic car, people always think I get such great mileage. I have the exact same gas mileage as my previous 4 door Jeep Cherokee - 19 miles per gallon. Also the sunroof rattles all the time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my G6 for about a 1 1/2 now and it has a little over 25 thousand miles. I am having brake issues. The car feels like I am riding with my brakes on. It's like the car is fighting against the brakes. If I let off the gas the car will come to a complete stop on its own. There has been a couple times that the front end of the car will start shaking really bad when I am going over 60 miles an hour and that is really scary. The dealer ship has shaved my rotors, replaced the brake booster and now they are going to replace the master cylinder. I really hope this solves my problems because I really do like this car. It rides nice, I like the look and the gas mileage is great. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a very poorly built car. This car has only 35k and I have a list of problems as long as my arm. Brakes shimmy bad, steering column squeaks, roof rattles (this isn't even a sunroof car), dash is already warped and buckling, cruise control quit working, engine leaks oil and looks like a ball of grease from below, one wheel bearing went bad, front bumper keeps poping out under the headlights, lots of wind noise, windshield wipers are oddballs and cost a fortune. This car was babied and as soon as the 30k warranty was out everything just started falling apart. Last, this car has no trade in, or resale value. It isn't worth half of what I paid for it. Now I can't even trade it off.</TEXT>

I had to have the steering pump and intermediate drive replaced.

<TEXT>I bought my G6 GT with the GTP package in May of 07. I love my car but have had few annoying issues with it. First issue, my car started whistling within 8 months of purchase. One entire line of the muffler had to be replace from the engine to the end. I live in Florida, so A/C is a must have. The A/C seems to have a mind on it's own and sometimes will not come on, so is the wiper system. I set the wipers on the continuous speed setting and they will go intermittent on me. Last issue, my top won't retract anymore. I bought the car brand new and only have one user, although I love my car, for the price I paid I was expecting more from GM.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car, in my opinion, is very cheaply made. The panoramic sunroof began rattling within a month from buying it. It's been in the garage 5 times to be repaired. GM even replaced the entire module during our last visit. Unfortunately, replacing the window did not help. The rattling and wind noise was so loud that we finally gave up and traded it in.

(by the way no-one carries the tires for this car, they HAVE to be ordered) $700 from tire rack! then spring came and i put the originals back on and with 31,000 miles on the tires (rotated every 2nd oil change) there were steel belts showing on 3 of the 4 tires and they had to be ordered $666.99 from the distributor where my dealership gets their tires. then the traction, and abs lights came on, as well as the air bag light</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my car because it's a Pontiac G6 thats red in color and has four doors. All my interior lights light up in red and some of my features are trimmed in chrome. I just recently purchased it with about 30,000 miles on it in may and I have a few minor problems such as my keypad does not work unless it decides and I am hearing a bump noise when I turn, kinda scared of my steering wheel coming off lol). I also begin hearing a whistling noise at one point but that went away. I really hope that I did not purchase the wrong vehicle because I love it so much. But I have only had it roughly three months. Everyone keeps telling me to trade and honestly I am leaning towards that. But I love my car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Living in Fl. I use the retractable hard top often and have never had a problem with it. Although it is a little awkward having to hold a button down for 30 sec. to lower the top. I have had so so gas mileage. My major problem has been with the finish on the hood of the car. It started chipping in November 2007. The dealer fixed it then and said they did the whole hood. Now I am having the same problem in the same spot 8 months later and they want to charge me for the repair. I have read other G6 consumer reviews who have had the same type of problem. Made a complaint to GM Service center but they went along with the dealer and said it was my problem to fix.The finish is poor on the G6.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the car, but...there is a rattle noise in the right rear quarter. Very annoying. Rear back seat rattles also. Sounds like I'm driving a popcorn machine. Rattles occur whether or not top is down. Makes no difference. If you've had this problem and it was fixed, let me know what was fixed. First dealership I took it to had no clue. I now have it at another dealership. Another issue is torque steer. When I get on it, hard to control the steering wheel. Anyone else experience this. Remedy, or than not getting on it? LOL. </TEXT>

I got rid of my old Pontiac because it was just having too many problems. Granted it had 150,000 miles on it. But this one is giving me headaches. One problem after another. Im also having problems with the visors coming out. I would do more homework next time before buying any car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this as a 2007 leftover in April 2008, at a huge savings. I got the Emerald Green, which I have not seen another of and love it. It was peppy when I first got it and is getting even better as I put more miles on it and the mileage is getting better too. The interior is very comfortable and functional as well. Seats are padded well and hold you in place well. The dash is easy to read and controls easy to reach and use. As far at the exterior is concerned, what can I say, I always thought Pontiac made a great looking car with very few exceptions (Aztek). I got remote start, sun and sound package and just want to say, I am very happy with this purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car rides smooth and engine is high performing. It's easy to do much higher than speed limit due to how smooth ride is. Handles very well. Sporty feel while still able to bring the kids along with four doors. I checked on Nissan Altima but no head room for a 6'2" person. I had a 2000 Pontiac Grand Prix GT for 7 years before I bought this car. I was not impressed with new Grand Prix models and the engines offered. Was very impressed that I could get the 224 HP engine in the G6. I get compliments on the look of car all the time. Real sharp with the nice alloy 17 inch rims. Only wish this version had the manual shift option like the GTP. Sporty car with plenty of style. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I replaced her 2000 Grand Prix GTP coupe with a a 2007 Blue-Gold Chrystal Metallic G6 GTP sedan. Through the first 7200 miles we've taken it on one road trip thus far and achieved an average of 30.6 mpg. Overall my wife and I are happy with the G6 GTP. However, the steering rack had to be replaced (warranty). The steering rack replacement was painless and took just one day (great local dealer). </TEXT>

Like another person said, this is the first car I am not sick of driving within the first few months. I love the design because it's sleek and smooth. I would not trade this car in for anything, and I can not wait to see how the G6 evolves over the next few years.</TEXT>

Purchased just a month ago, and I still can't get over a very competent sporty ride, solid build, just the right suspension, firm cornering, and loads of torque for sudden acceleration. Very roomy too, and all controls are nicely placed. The car is a pleasure to look at and a joy to drive!</TEXT>

I do love to ride with the roof open but when it is closed, there is so much wind noise that you can not even talk! My car is in the shop now for the 9th time to repairs this. They have had it for 9 days now! GM is involved and I hope they buy it back! Multiple other problems exist as well, brakes, environmental system was putting a bad smell into the car, power steering racks wen out when car was 11 months old, had to have heaters on seats checked. Gas miles not as good as stated.</TEXT>

The exterior is amazing, I have seen some reviews about them not having remote locks, I guess I thought it was standard.

<TEXT>Traded this car after 1 year. Couldn't get over the rough ride very cheap plastic bland interior. The front seats are hard as rocks and the drivers seat (not power) was horribly uncomfortable and actually put your legs to sleep. i always felt like i was in a cave while driving this car. Then the steering at 9,000 miles broke and that was it for me. Read past blogs about the major problem Pontiac is having with this crap steering system. i was not interested in keeping a car with abysmal ratings in my garage any longer. Went with Hyundai 09 sonata and so much happier. i also got 22 miles per gallon in the city with some highway driving here in Chicago and i am far from a lead foot. </TEXT>

Biggest problem is the electric steering is going out and dealers are scratching heads trying to fix it (I have been to 2 dealers 3 times) engine is making some noise when cold and loosing a little power.Interior parts are cheap with a few cracks and breaks.If the car can be fixed this is still a peppy little car with a great price tag, that turns heads a carries a great 5year, 100,000 mile warranty.

<TEXT>I bought this car in Dec. '06 and never had buyer's remorse. This car is very quick and my friends are impressed with the superb road holding. It also gets decent mileage (I'm averaging 24 mpg city/hwy). The 6A is awesome (won't find that on Accord or Altima) and the trip tonic will hold gear even if you floor the throttle. 18" wheels typically scratch easily but the treadwall height on these tires is enough that the tires absorb impact upon curb contact. The 8-spkr Monsoon is awesome. Excellent cargo capacity with folding rear seats. No reliability issues so far - car has only needed oil changes and tire rotation. Heated seats work well and the two-tone leather looks great. Buy it</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The remote start without question. This feature is a jaw-dropper. The fast-back rear window looks great. OnStar unlocked my car when I inadvertently left my keys in the trunk. The hands-free dialing works well also. Enough rear headroom to get 6-footers across town, 66" girls fit comfortably.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this car to replace a 2003 Mazda 6 w/ 190K miles. I can not get over how happy I am with my purchase. Who said base model cars have to be stripped down or cheap? Not this one! The car handles like it should cost more and its so quiet and torquey you won't even realize you're blowing by posted speed limits like its nothing. Although I bought it used with 15K miles on it, I still have the remainder of the factory warranties and a vehicle that in my opinion outperforms the Mazda in all aspects it makes me dread driving my wife's boring 2007 Toyota Camry. If anyone is in the market for a solid built midsize car don't neglect checking out the G6, it will surprise you.</TEXT>

The car is sharper than a bag of thumbtacks, flies down the highway like a rocket ship, sips gasoline and handles like it is on rails. I receive at least one comment daily about the styling alone! This car is miles ahead of its competition in terms of what it offers for the money. The four cylinder is quite capable of getting you where you need to go without too much waiting. Usually when there is a four cylinder and a six offered in a car, the former crowd complains.Here both crowds sit back in their with evil grins! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Ladies and Gentleman. Hallelujuh, the cheap car blues are over! I have recently purchased a 2.4ltr G6 sedan and I am loving every minute that I drive this beautiful creature. First of all the aggressive sports stance and stunning good looks of my black beauty turn heads. Never had anybody ask about my Civic. Never. Secondly, if you press on the gas this car will run away faster than a stripper from a tent revival. (In case you didn't know that's pretty quick)The engine very smooth and even with the automatic tranny the car is able to get the power to the ground and thus, move quickly. That said, I would suggest this car to the budget minded individual who doesn't want to look like it.</TEXT>

I wanted a convertible and since I drive 100+ miles a day, I also wanted quiet and comfort. This car provides both with its retractable hard top. Steers great, back seats are comfortable.

<TEXT>Bought the base G6 as a third car, to save gas and wear on my '04 Envoy, then pass to my kid in about 5 years. Love the looks, veery roomy inside for a smaller car, especially the rear seat. Performance has been better than I expected from the 4-cyl. The tires aren't the best, and the wheel covers are cheap plastic, but they do ride on 16" rims. Many features that are optional or unavailable in a Civic or Corolla are standard here, but I find the manual locks to be an unnecessary complication. You cannot lock/unlock all doors with the key from the outside. I wish I could add keyless remote entry without having to get a package that includes 17" alloys and cruise control.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is perfect for south Florida. It looks great with the top up or down. Most times it's down. A very important consideration when I bought the G-6 was that my elderly mothers' wheelchair would fit in the trunk. It fits perfectly.

I bought a Saturn Sky the same day for a "fun car" and find that the G6 gets just as many looks and comments from people and handles nearly as well. </TEXT>

I think the interieor is awesome and I love the chrome around the speedometer. Great stereo system and the message center is helpful. A couple of downfalls. I thought it would be alittle better on gas and very tight when making a U- turn. I also agree truck opening could be alittle bigger but that would obviously change the outer look.

<TEXT>Owned this 2.4cyl G6 for a little over a year now. I cannot count the times people have commented on how clean and sporty it is. It turns on a dime! Very low road noise, comfortable seating, especially in the back lots of leg room! Dash has a sweet design to it. I have all black interior with the chrome bezels on vents and dash. 169HP 4 banger gives me plenty of power if I need to punch it to get on the interstate. Gas mileage is great. Have not had 1 issue with this car yet. Very impresed with the quality and craftmanship that went into this car, it is a base model but you'd swear it looks like you payed more!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am totally pleased with this car! The looks are fresh and cool and the preformance is way beyond my old Grand Am. The car feels solid and is realatively quiet on the road. Also the controls and buttons are well laid out and easy to operate on the go. For the price, the amount of features and innovations is impossible to beat. Also, given the size of the car, it is incredibly roomy in front and back. The driving position is higher, and the dash is lower and pushed back giving great visability. What a great step up in all aspects. The warranty is nice too. Ask about Pontiac's new policy with 5yr bumper to bumper. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sunroof is sweet! Also, the red illumination at night gives the car a sportier feel. I also really like the driver information center and the awesome sound system!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned this car for almost 2 years. Overall the car seems good. Real good power from the 3.5 V-6. I get 24.5 MPG. The inside seems a little cheep. I need the visors replaced, the door switch, for the widows replaced, and the black is pealing off the radio. Oh ,and dont even think about a U-Turn in this car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The V-6. 16" rims. XM radio. Remote start-must have. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was not expecting a car like this to handle the way it did. Very tight and nimble. Nor did I expect to get the power from a 4 cylinder, which I bought for the city driving mileage. The engine and transmission mesh very well. Turning is true and direct. I like the variable turning too, finger tip easy at rest and appropriate resistance on the fly. We love everything about this car. We did not think we would get such a smart interior. Nothing phony. What trim there is looks smart. We chose the fun and sun package and the rear spoiler with the mud guards in metalic silver. Looks real sharp and sporty. Got a good deal too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The peppy engine, the performance, sun roof, great brakes and sporty styling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a fun car to drive, gets decent gas mileage - I get at least 27 on highway and 22 in the city. You'll contantly look at the speedometer because it's so easy to go over the limit w/ this car. I have about 15K miles on the car w/ no problems.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Red interior lighting, remote start, sun roof.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great car. Bought for my wife since we have 1 child and another on the way. Great family vehicle with that feel of a sporty car. Never have a problem with power. Live in Texas so the summer is very hot. AC is very good in the vehicle. Very affordable and the ease of a GM car. Recommend the sun/sound package and the sport package if getting the standard.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, AC, handling, XM, sound system, smooth ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first American car since 1983. Didn't think the styling and quality of American cars was as good as the foreign cars. Times are changing. This convertible is a blast to drive. It is one of the best looking convertibles out there. I get so many looks driving down the road. And when I stop to raise/lower the hardtop people just stop and stare. It is a very comfortable car to drive. Roomy, good seats, very good instrumentation, very smooth and quiet ride for a car this small. The fit and finish of this car is first rate. I got mine with the premium and sport package and it is a very solid buy. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The hard convert top is my favorite feature. Makes the car a beautiful convertible and just as stunning when top is up. Looks like a beautiful 2dr coupe. Monsoon radio is great. Love driving down the road listening to my iPod. With top down aiflow is good, not real disruptive, can easily have a conversation</FAVORITE>
