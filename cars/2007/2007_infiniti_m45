<TEXT>Purchased this car used w/27,000 miles on it. CPO Infiniti. I'm a Lexus guy and still own one but this car really opened my eyes. The ride quality is great, no issues with sport suspension. Interior is quiet as any luxury car I have ever driven. This car takes no backseat to any German luxo sedan out there.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Outside styling, sport suspension.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After researching several cars in this class including the BMW550 and the Lexus IS350 and others, I selected the M45Sport for its handling and value. Two problems for a 65 year old like me are: 1) Stiff ride for long trips. 2) Road noise. Gas mileage is another problem. Toyota has the technology backwards: If you want the sensing of front traffic while on cruise control or lane change notice, then push a button not the other way around. Excellent car overall.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Reliability. Adequate power. Very good handling. Very good sound system. Value for the dollar.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I forgot to add that I love the 14 speaker Bose system in this car! 5.1 surround sound is just unheard of in a vehicle until now! Wonderful! The 6-in-dash CD changer and DVD in the center console is great as well! This car is like a mobile home audio entertainment system almost. The heated and cooled front seats are great too!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 5.1 sur, DVD, nav, and Xenon head lamps, chromed wheels. I love the fuel, air pres, and maintenance monitors! All cars should come with an oil change and tire rotation schedule reminder! That preventative maintenance would save so many people a lot of money in the long run. Homelink is nice too </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I opted out from buying the Sport model due to it being for my wife and the harsher ride. I purchased a used 2007 M45 with 18K. It has the Tech pkg & the Advanced Tech pkg. It may have the 18" wheels, but they are chrome and this car has the ground effect pkg including the spoiler like the Sport model. You cant beat the Graphite Metallic exterior and the black interior color combo! It handles great and has lots of power, though for a V8, I think there is a lot of it capped somewhere in the programming. This car is loaded with features! It has everything except the power rear seat controls. The steering, braking, balance, and power combo is superb! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the sport car like seats. The nav and backup camera work great. The car handles very well for a 4dr sedan. You would almost think its a sports car. I love the power potential of this car and that it's correct wheel drive! You cannot beat rear wheel drive, unless I guess you have the AWD one!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my eye out for this car ever since I heard there would be a replacement for the Ms. Right away I loved the look of it from every angle. My last car was an Infiniti and I have found that Infiniti treats its customers right. It has the good power that require. When I first heard the 5.1 sound system I was sold. The car feels and sounds solid. A little too much road noise when the road has thumps. Other than that I love the car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The reason I chose this car over others is my love for music. The DVD system with 5.1 sound and speakers in the headrest is outstanding. Best sound anywhere. I love the look of the car, and being a big man this car is super comfortable for me. Great power in all situations. Good navigation system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall, this is a great sedan. The mileage is rated at 17 city and 23 highway and I have been averaging about 19 combined. I live in Minnesota and we had our first major snowfall yesterday. With rear wheel drive and the all season tires it did not perform well so I am having some snow tires put on. That should make a huge difference.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear view camera, navigation system, acceleration, push botton start, interior materials are very high quality.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>While this car is complete with everything, the only thing that is in need of improvement is the Sport Rims. The car runs fantastic with every possible feature, DVD, Bluetooth, navigation with voice recognition, etc. However, the roads here in New England make sense for stronger sport rims as they are built too soft and have twice caused major cracking to the wheels which had to be replaced. While this is a not necessarily a flaw, normal driving conditions in New England include potholes, and hindsight is 20/20 and I would have chosen different more durable rims, although the sport rims give a better appearance. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Being my first sedan since my 1989 Ford SHO, and many Suburban and pickups in between, I spent 1 year researching and dreaming of what I wanted in a sports sedan. The Infiniti M45 Sport has exceeded all my expectations. My only complaints would be the poor fuel mileage (what did I expect in a 335 hp hot rod?), perceived need for a six-speed transmission, and the non-effective high-beam headlights. But these complaints would not deter me from buying this car all over again. I probably should have sprung for the Bose 5.1 surround-sound system, but the regular Bose system is certainly no slouch. Fresh off a mountain romp through the twisties, the smile on my face could very well be permanent!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Deceivingly smooth and powerful engine. Solid and quiet chassis. Extremely supportive seats. All kinds of techno-features. Way cool nav system. Roomy front and respectful rear seat room. Great handling. More than ample trunk space.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the M45 sport 2 months ago and can't be happier with the choice I made. This car handles and drives better than the competing 5 series models I drove and leaves most luxury sedans in the dust. It wasn't the value that drove me to buy this car (it is way cheaper than the beamer) but the overall package. Even the much more expensive BMW 550 doesn't deliver the luxury this car delivers, and I prefer the interior of this car. The back seat passengers have more leg-room and can actually adjust their seats. This is the first time my two kids have stopped fighting over the front seat. The younger one actually prefers the back. Overall, could't be happier. Love, love the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car is a great mix of luxury and power and sports car all in one. Very comfortable seats, very smooth power. Car really does well in the 40-80 acceleration. 4000 miles and only an oil change. Car handles very well, better than my BMW 530i.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove BMW 335i and xi, 328xi, and 535i and xi, and although these cars were more aggressive driver's cars than the M45 sport sedan, I purchased the Infiniti. Major deciding points: M45 was priced similarly to the 335xi, but had more power, better features, and much better interior than any of the BMWs. If I were driving in Europe, I would buy the BMW, but in the US, the M45 Sport is a better package and it is cheaper!! By the way, the 328xi and 530xi do not even compete with the M35, let alone the M45. If you are seriously considering any version of the 2007 328 or 2008 530, do yourself a favor and compare it to the M35/45. Infiniti clearly beats these cars!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4.5 V8. Active steering. Awesome braking system. Navigation system. Adaptive Cruise (didn't think I wanted this, but now I always use it!!). DVD-Audio 5.1 audio system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Everything that you have read about this car is true (it's great), it's hard to believe anyone being disappointed with the M45 Sport. However if you drive this car on the highway at night, you need to know that the design of the headlights is faulty. The high beams are focused so high that they do not illuminate the road in front of the car at all. There is a single adjust for both high and low beam lights so if you take your car to the dealer they will misalign the low beam focus if you complain of the faulty high beams. I drive 70 miles at night on a desert highway to work daily, if you drive your M45 in town this will not be an issue.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove Volvo, Saturn, BMW, Mercedes, Audi and Lexus. None of these other cars are so much fun to drive with such great technology features as the Infiniti. My M45 is fast, easy to drive, comfortable with more leg and head space than Audi, BMW or Mercedes has. What a smooth ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've driven BMWs 12 out of the last 20 years. Went to look and prices were out of site. Drove 530, E350/550, GS 450h, Audi A6 then the M45. Drove out loaded advanced tech package, spoiler and rosewood. Car is a dream. Has every luxury item that the Germans nickle and dime you with. Very smooth but powerful acceleration. Quiet comfy interior, great stereo and nav, ac seats are great in florida.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased this car and loved the way it handled. I just traveled from Florida to Virginia and back, and that's when I really appreciated the car's handling and features. The navigation system routed me differently than I usually go, and it turned out better. The steering control of the bluetooth phone, stereo, and cruise control was great. The gas mileage was a little lower (19.2 MPG) than I would like, but the power and comfort made it worthwhile.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation system, backup camera, bluetooth. I purchased the Infiniti chrome wheels. They really dressed up the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased an M35 for our new "non-soccer parents" phase of our life (we're in our late 40's). After ~6 weeks of driving we are extremely pleased with the comfort and performance (not surprising considering our last vehicle was a Toyota Sienna minivan). The disappointment is the mileage is at the low end of its rating (we're getting ~20 mpg when gas is >$3/gallon!). We test drove the Lexus GS 350, Mercedes E350 and Acura RL. The M has the comfort and peformance we wanted.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Where to start after upgrading from a minivan! First would be the "memory system" for driver's seat & mirror. Control center is easy to use! Sound system is very good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just leased 2007 sport model with techno package and aerodynamic kit black on black and must say it is one hell of a car. I have been looking for a while and narrowed my choices down to BMW 530i sport and Infiniti M45, I was leaning more towards Infiniti although it was more expensive than BMW but I was able to get a great deal and all the options I was looking for. This car feels expensive and it is a blast to drive! The engine is so smooth and the exhaust growl makes me want to floor it every time. Even when I pull up to Mercedes S class or BMW 7 series they can't help but stare at my Infiniti and then I leave them in my dust.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering responsiveness and chassis balance. The power is always there and there's plenty in reserves. Rear view camera is useful. Driver's front, side and rear road views. The fuel economy is not bad for V8. Speed and every day comfort. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have the M35X not the 45. I find the 6 to be big enough to get me out of any tight spots without any requirement for a larger engine. The car is a wonderful machine. I had to get used to the dash system, but once mastered it became very easy to navigate. I look forward to driving this car as it handles like a dream in the curves an open road. I have owned two Lexus a 2001E and 2000G. Both were wonderful cars but I like my Infinity best of the three.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>the engine and the various small items not noticed until needed, ie., the lane changer, the back up camera, the blue tooth, the navigation system, the air and heated seats, the comfortable seats. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After test driving almost every model made by BMW, Mercedes, Audi & Lexus, I was surprised that the Infiniti M45 was the most comfortable, fun to drive and intelligently designed of the bunch. I wanted a 4-door sedan, so during the test drive I put my 6'3" son in the back seat and he had plenty of leg & headroom (not the case with the BMW 5 or 7 series, nor the Mercedes E or S Series). The electronic systems are easy to use - I pretty much had it down after the first drive. It's a really fast car - in fact, I've had to talk my way out of two speeding tickets in the year I've owned it. No problems whatsoever, great sound system (I got the sport model with the nav/tech package).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Favorite features are: 1 - The handling, power and speed. I wanted something that was fun to drive, yet still a 4-door (and the BMW M5 isn't very comfortable). 2 - The electronics. The Japanese invented this stuff (Sony, Panasonic, etc) and the driver interface is simple and fairly intuitive. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Leased this car about 3 weeks ago. Have been following this model since the redesign in 2006. When my 2003 Volvo S80 lease was about to end, I saw an special on the website. I went in to the local dealer and they were able to set me up. although I went in to get an M35, I ended up deciding on the M45 Sport. The 8 cylinder is only 1 mile per gallon different in the MPG. The power of the 4.5L is quiet but very muscular. The interior comforts are great and the overall appearance of the car bring many compliments. Got a 21 month lease on the car at about $100.00 per month more than I was paying for my S80. love driving this machine....</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 3500 miles the M45 has been a pure joy to drive. The rear view camera works very well as does the adaptive speed control. The lane departure function can be annoying on streets that have uneven surfaces or are a bit rough as these surfaces are picked up as lines and false readings are frequent. I am about to turn this feature off. Acceleration is more than adequate and handling is superb. Fuel consumption is a bit disappointing at only 16 mpg combined. Overall a great car. </TEXT>
