<TEXT>I bought this after 3 BMWs and did so because service is so awful on BMWs in Southern California. Lexus service is truly amazing and so far ahead of any other car type that it is hard to believe. However, this car is like driving down the road on a jello square. It handles loosely, and because of the continuously variable transmission it feel like you are driving a motor boat more than a car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just drove my car home last night and still have to set up all the bells and whistles, but what a lot of fun just driving has been for 24 hrs. This car is smoking fast and the power is so smooth and linear - it just keeps pulling until you are well over 100.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The nav, slingshot acceleration, gorgeous fit and finish, a real pretty car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I migrated from an '06 Corvette C6, and was expecting a letup in performance. Not so! This car is extremely fun to drive, and I am averaging around 26 mpg, compared to 19 in the much-lighter Corvette. I am totally satisfied with this, my first Lexus ever.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Active handling option, park assist.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car rocks. Excellent style and finish with all Lexus has to offer, while setting the bar on environmental responsibility for discriminating buyers. Performance is off the chart for a hybrid and I am averaging approx 27.5 MPG at 15,000 miles. Service is Lexus excellence plus and I couldn't be happier with this vehicle. Anyone who can afford to make a vehicle purchase decision based on luxury, performance and most importantly environmental impact should consider this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What I wanted: reliability, green car, sporty handling and acceleration, ability to fit five passengers, ultimate comfort, 4 wheel drive. What I got: everything but 4 wheel drive. What an amazing car. Don't be fooled by the similar appearance to other GS versions. I test drove the standard gas version of this car and found it lackluster, noisy and boring. This car is totally different. It is the fastest and most powerful in the GS line up and has remarkable acceleration. It gets around 27 mpg in non performance mode too. It's an amazing blend of comfort and technology.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hits: Car performs great lost of power and quality all over, Nice features (when you can use them). Clean lines - Lexus legacy luxury in a sport sedan. Great car !! A+++ Misses: dash usablity. Lock out when driving of features on most items, song list of CDs. (Only can play MP3 CDs (255 song limit) NO DVD MP3 even though it is a DVD changer.) Radio list remains at speed (why is this so different than a CD list I have no idea). 2007 Acura MDX have it right when it comes to the Glass Dash. You can use the features as expected. Lexus (Toyota) has taken conservative to a new level. I hope they lighten up and come up with a software update. (I'll even sign a waiver.) PLEASE LEXUS fix this!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Awesome power at any speed. The quiet is something to behold. It is almost like floating!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I decided to go from 3 cars to 2, so we traded in a 2001 Accord EX V6 and a 2003 BMW M3 for the GS 450h. We ended up with a car that carries people better than the Accord, performs better than the M3 (really), and gets better gas mileage than either (we get between 26 and 27 mpg). If you drive it like a high-powered sports car, it will perform like same - right down to gas mileage in the teens. If you drive it like a sedan, it will give you all that plus another 5 mpg. Visibility is excellent. Controls are perfect. Everybody can find a comfortable seating position. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This is my third GPS/Nav, and by far the best I have seen. Take a look even if you have rejected them in the past. The Bluetooth integration is great. There is outrageous power at all speeds. Its "rolling start" - more typical of daily use -is even superior to its 0 to 60. Great transmission.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I understand the lack of trunk space - where else to put the battery. Worst mileage is around town at 23; best mileage 28.5 at avg. 75 mph on a 500 mile trip. Navigation system and electronics, particularly LED interior ligthing, are way ahead of competitors. This one was equipped with the collision avoidance package - speed matching on cruise takes some getting used to but is easy to over ride with the gas pedal. I honestly believe you could set the cruise at 80 and head for a obstacle or wall and the system would stop the car well short of it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Absolutely the fastest car from 80 to 100+ I've ever owned. The transmission is exceptional & don't miss the down shifting in manual mode. Fit & quality are "Lexus".</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Went to the taste of lexus event and loved the car. I traded in my 2002 LS 430 (which I loved). I love the hybrid, not because I am saving gas money (currently getting 14 mpg, due to my style of driving). It is incredibly fast and can keep up with most porsche cars. The sport transmission is amazing, and the car is up to par with what I had in mind. Very sexy design, but if you want to spend less money buy the GS 350, it;s only 37 less horse power. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bluetooth speaker, navigations, DVD player, 14 speaker stereo, full programmability - a lot of toys keep you busy for hours.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have a 1998 GS 400. Have owned/leased at least 5 others since 1993. This one does not live up to the hype. Extremely annoying feeling of gas- electric-gas kickin/out etc. at speeds around 59 mph. Miniscule trunk. I am currently attempting to get out from under this "Edsel". PS: the mileage is really only a 4-5 mpg better than my GS 400.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It is not a BMW 550i, but it comes quite close in terms of handling. Interior materials are a bit superior to those seen in a BMW, especially when it comes to sound. Given Lexus/Toyota high levels of reliability this vehicle was a better choice for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The performance of this car is mind-boggling. If you floor the gas while driving at 70 to 80 mph, you WILL get pushed back into your seat and blow by everything else on the road. If you are over 6 feet tall, you should definitely sit in a GS before purchasing, especially if you tend to sit straight in your seat. I'm 6' 1" and my head touches the roof. The trunk is definitely tiny, but I personally do not place large suitcases or any other significant cargo into the trunk on a daily basis, so this is a non-issue. For trips to Costco or the airport, we just use the other car, an SUV. The navigation voice recognition takes some practice, but otherwise the nav system itself is powerful</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the acceleration and the feeling of driving a "sports" car while getting decent gas mileage. Have owned two other Lexus vehicles and this vehicle continues the streak of flawless fit and finish. I've gotten many compliments and a few negative comments about having a "luxury hybrid". I chalk those comments up to jealousy. Gas mileage has been consistently in the 24 - 26 mpg range (and I have a lead foot sometimes). With Virginia's tax credit, this wasn't that much more expensive than the regular GS model and I get to use HOV lanes!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car blew my mind. I have never accelerated so fast from 70mph and in such comfort and tactile excellence. 24 mpg is great with this level of performance. Navigation is intuitive and easy to 'talk to'. The music system sounds like I'm in a concert hall. I love this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation system, power acceleration from all speeds, rich interior that is well thought out. Quiet attitude and the ability to customize everything to your needs.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wonderful car overall. I had owned an Acura RL and BMW 5 series prior to purchasing the Hybrid GS450 only about 4 weeks ago. Downsides are small trunk space and less than predicted fuel economy (so far, only one tank and I got 22 MPG...the vehicle rating claims are 24-28 MPG). I find the car to be a great combination of comfort and performance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My experience with the Lexus GS 450h, although brief, has been overwhelmingly positive, both in terms of performance and mileage. I drive 500+ miles a week; 80% highway, 20% city. I have consistently been averaging 28+ mpg highway (150 + mile trips), 27+ mpg city (5-15 mile trips). Having the minute-to-minute feedback from the gas consumption screen enables you to maximize your mpg, and once you learn the correct way to drive a hybrid, the fuel economy is certainly attainable, if not beatable! And that includes a mixture of usual gas-hungry aggressive driving such as frequent quick accelerations such as merging from an entrance ramp, and just blowing away fellow drivers when passing. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I received one of the first Lexus GS 450h hybrid sedans. I had been driving an LS model. The GS definitely feels like a step down in luxury. I have been getting a disappointing 20-21 miles per gallon. The interior feels cramped compared to the LS. However, the GS hybrid has plenty of power and is fun to drive. I would think twice before spending the extra money to get the hybrid model of this car.</TEXT>
