<TEXT>Of the cars that I have owned, this is my favorite! It's so much fun to drive, and great if you have to commute a lot because its so easy to zip in and out of traffic. A great looking car too. I have never had any problems with it. It's fast and a smooth ride. Recommended!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great comfort for a short person such as myself at 5'1! Only problems I have are the blind spots due to the side mirrors. Hearing some odd noises coming front front tires that can be described as a rubber rubbing noise that I will take it into the dealership to see what that is from. It's a sporty and fun car to drive! I have had numerous people ask me if it was a Porche!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Like the exterior and interior looks! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car looks awesome, but I have had problems with it. First off it has rust spots on the hood and Hyundai said they are not responsible for it.Poor paint job. A year in a half into owning it, the clutch went out on me. The dealer asked me if it was my first stick shift car and I told him NO!!He then proceeded to tell me that I must not be driving it right and that I must be riding the clutch too much. I learned how to drive on a manual! It only had a lil less then 15,000 miles on it. After I talked to my mechanic and he told me there was no way that I ruined the clutch and the fly wheel and I informed the dealer of the poor reviews on the clutch, I got it fixed under warranty. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the way it drives. It is a very fun car and it looks sharp!! The price is great, and the compliments are amazing. Everyone thinks its a top of the line sports car that was real expensive. Little do they know! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Really nice car to look at, but to drive - I'm not sure yet. It's got some great features, does well on the MPG - I got a amazing deal on it but the car lacks a little power and feels heavy at speed. It almost seems like one of those midlife crisis cars that have appearance but no substance?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car! The exterior styling is what let me to purchase the Tiburon. The price was well below comparable sports cars. My MPG is slightly better than I was expecting based on the published MPG. On the low end I have never got fewer than 24, and the highest has been 29. I now have driven it to 23,000 miles with no mechanical problems. A little wear spot on the leather seat bolster. The 6th gear, ratio, could be a little higher it "tacks" about 900rpm's higher that my old 5sp Mits. Eclipse at 60MPH. It could do better on fuel consumption if the 1-6th gear ratios were different, especially 6th. There is noticeable acceleration steer. The accelerator pedal and brake pedal are to close together.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Price, styling, great front wheel drive handling in snow, windy conditions. Factory rims a cool! Good quality in and out. Performance is acceptable for our commuter use of the car. Solid car overall. We are so impressed with this car that we are looking at a Hyundai SUV for the Wife. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my Tiburon new in 07 and a few months after I bought it it died on the railroad tracks and they had to come get it and take it to the dealership to fix it. After a week of having it back supposedly fixed it died again but after the second time they fixed I haven't had another other problems from it. It's a great car and I get tons of compliments I even walked outside one day to find a woman taking pictures of it because there aren't many in my area and mine is the only Limited for miles. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Bad Tires</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I bought the Tiburon new. I started having trouble with the tires right away. Had to air them up within first month, and every 6-8 weeks after that. Took it back to the dealer four times. They said no apparent leak, maybe a problem with the seal. So added nitrogen. 8 weeks later, a tire low again. Deal will not replace tire. Hyundai customer service says Hyundai is not responsible for defective tires, the tire manufacturer is. I purchased road hazard and extended warranty. Neither will cover defective tires. I don't feel safe driving the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I have owned my 07 Tiburon for over a year and I have not had a single problem with it in any way. This car is compact, and fun to drive. People will turn their head when they see you drive by. I have had compliments from other drivers while at the red light. The exterior gives a very sporty and pricey look. The interior is very sharp and modern looking. The vehicle is built very strong which is noticeable when you get in and close the door. Friends will want a ride with you all of the time. My friend say in the drivers seat, turned on the car and said "wow". The engine sounds great for a 4 cyl. and acceleration is impressive. I recommend this car mostly for reliability and looks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First, I gave the performance a 5 because a stock GS can hardly get out of it's own way but for less than a GT costs you can upgrade performance parts that will not void the warranty and make it faster than a GT or SE. With that said. The car is way under priced! Exterior design is somewhat exotic and the interior, even after a year, is still not boring. Since owning the car I've had to replace my interior carpet because a hole wore in just below the gas pedal. That can be blamed on the dealer because they never gave me floor mats. Overall this is an awesome car but if you can afford it go with the GT or SE.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned this car for 1 year now, and has no problem with it. Still perform great, I have no problem with the performance of the car, as I can easily overtake any audis, bmws or benzies on the highway. Its true that the tiburon is not as powerful as some other high performance sport cars, but speed defend on both the driver and the car not just the car alone. The tib can easily do 180 km/h, but then again only pro race car drivers would drive any faster... Simply put, the tiburon is best of class in term of price per features. If you crave that extra power then you can easily add a supercharger on your tiby for only a few grands. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior design is stunning, if the Tib has no logo on it to identify the manufacturer, it would have look like some expensive and exotic sports car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We originally owned an '03 Tiburon and '02 Jetta. We wanted to downsize to 1 car, so it had to be reliable, high-quality, and with great performance. Our '03 Tib had been awesome, but we initially felt like trying something new. We test drove 7 other '07 cars including Acura TSX, Eclipse GT, and Lexus is250. To our surprise, none of them could match Tiburon's combo of reliability, quality, performance, warranty, and features we wanted --- except the Lexus for $11,000 more! So, we bought the '07 SE (6-cyl manual). LOVE this car. A joy to drive, beautiful inside and out. Trust us: the back seat is fine for 2 adults for around town; front seat has as much headroom as the Jetta. 100% satisfied!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently bought my Tiburon GT back in August as a b-day for both my wife and myself. Since we bought the Tiburon we've put it to the test. I put ours on the track in it's initial break in phase <1K and broken-in >1.5K so to speak realms. Best times: (Track proven and mounted with window sticker over our mantle) 0-60: 7.537/6.819 Top Speed: 149 1/8 mile: 10.729 65.10 /9.879 71.42 The ride is INCREDIBLY smooth, even compared to my parents CLK 320 and ML 55 AMG Mercedes's. Cornering is phenemonal with minimal body roll. Also for you peeps wanting a date magnet, well this car will do the trick. Even my friends thought I spent over 30K but don't tell them I got it for 18.4 driveout.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, cornering, acceleration, throttle response, looks, ride, road noise is minimal to none, small back seats=keeps my friends from wanting to ride but allows kids to have a comfy and roomy ride. Price:Performance is outstanding. Bad weather handling and gas mileage is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned a 97 Tiburon, a 03 tiburon, and am now the proud owner of a 07 tiburon. I love the line, it's always provided me with fun driving and this year is no different. The most notable is the chassis just feels stiffer then ever. The steering is very tight and gives that racing feel. The 07 looks better then ever and Im enjoying it. I suppose when the new model comes out in 09 I will wait till around 12 and purchase that year! keep up the good work Hyundai</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one very solidly built vehicle. You can feel it in the doors, hatchback and hood. It handles very well for a car this heavy. There is pronounced torque steer when turning under a heavy throttle, but if you know it's going to happen it's very easy to correct for. Good power and torque. Very fun to drive. The six speed manual is definately the way to go. Huge track bars front and rear allow aggressive cornering without body roll. Quality Kenwood sound system driving six speakers. Radio quality hampered a bit by the in glass antennae. Overall, one great sporty coupe!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Tiburon SE is alot of car for the money(ESC,TCM,Sport tuned suspention, which gives it a much better ride than the GT). I drove all the Tibs and the SE gets 4 stars in the fun factor. I was looking at the 350Z but didn't want to pay another 7-10K more for a car that seemed to handle the same as the SE. And storage was an issue too. 14.5 cubic feet in the back, plenty of room for a week on the road. It's not the fastest car in it's price range, but it looks and feels like a sports car. In world of boring bubble cars this little hot rod stands out in the crowd.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Tib for nearly a year now and I absolutely love it. The gas mileage is far better than I expected from a sports car. The outside design and detailing is fantastic. The beige leather interior (found only in the 2007 GT Limited) coupled with the sleek black exterior I chose really gives this car a very expensive look for only a little bit of money. I get compliments on this car all the time. "That is a beautiful car." "What a sweet ride." And so on and so forth. It has a great deal of power and it handles well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the fact that it is a front-wheel drive sports car. This allows the car to handle better than other sports cars in snowy weather. Shift-tronic is also a lot of fun! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is truly amazing! It gets really good gas millage. I got 400 miles out of the first tank and only put 12.125 gallons of gas in it!!! The price you pay for the millage is the power. While this car isn't anywhere NEAR powerful for a sports car(138 hp/136 ft-lbs) it does get around ok and can keep up with traffic without needing to red line every gear. The styling both inside and out is great. Everything is easy to reach. It's super comfortable to ride in and takes corners like a pro. Overall, this is a great car, Good bang for the buck and really fun on the back roads. All this for only 18 K!!! You can't go wrong. :D</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went into the dealership to buy a base model GS and after driving the SE (due to the fact the color I wanted in the GS was no where to be found) there was no turning back. The car drives solid as a rock. The 6 spd trans. is very precise and easy to drive. The duel exhaust sounds "throaty"! The car is very sound and well constructed...just close the door and see how solid it sounds..it sounds like the door closing on my girl friends Lexis 330. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When enough people find out about the Tiburon and drive one, I'm sure Hyundai could raise the price of this car by $5,000 - possibly more. The car looks like a $30,000 to $35,000 vehicle. I believe that because Korean cars have had a bad reputation in the past that Hyundai is selling this vehicle for thousands of dollars less than a well established auto manufacturer could get for this car. I can't think of a single thing wrong with this vehicle at the price it sells for. I test drove many other cars in the Tiburon's price range before purchasing the Tiburon. I'm talking about the 2007 Tiburon GT specifically. The car is too much fun to drive, never fails to turn heads! WOW! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior design, the attention to detail, the responsive handling, the torque and the fun factor! The ShiftTronic automatic transmission was a delightful surprise!

<TEXT>This car drives like the real deal. It outperforms most of the others in its class, and that's obvious in traffic and on the highway. The gearbox is nice and tight, the clutch pedal requires just enough force to keep me from wanting to ride it, and its performance at the high end is remarkable for the price. Then, on top of the great performance, it turns heads wherever it goes, and I look and feel great in it.</TEXT>

This V6 is extremely responsive, the shifter is nice and tight, and I'm as comfortable and secure in my seat in tight curves at high speeds as I am on the straightaway. The new colors from '07 are awesome, and I've gotten a lot of complements at my infrequent fuel stops.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th Hyundai (2 Elantra GTs, Tucson) and I can not say enough good things about all of them. I am 56, a former test driver, racer etc. and the quality and cost/benefit ratio of owning a Hyundai is clearly above all others. The new Tib is simply, to me, stunning in its purity and is an improved version of the Ferrari 456 it was designed after. The interior is clean and functional, the ride tight and controlled, the braking linear and the 4cyl is more than adequate with the quick shifting close ratio 5sp. With only 500 (engine still not broken in) miles on it, I got 35.2 hwy at a steady 65mph- that's hard to beat and equals the Elantra. And, every day someone asks me what it is. </TEXT>

The car in solid made you don't feel like you just purchased and sheet of plastic on wheels, Im very impressed with the exterior as well excellent front and rear design and lighting, excellent drive lighting as well.
