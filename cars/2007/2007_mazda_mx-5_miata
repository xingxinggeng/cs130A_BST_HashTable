<TEXT>I wanted a 2 seater but not the Miata. I went to go get the Sky, loved the exterior but hated the interior, same with the solstice. I test drove every other 2 seater less than 35,000 then I said to be fair I would test drive the Miata. I fell in love. My only regret is that I should have gotten the touring special edition. But when I purchase a new one I will get it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I do not have to get out of the car to let the top up or down and when the top is down I can use the trunk (not like some of the other 2 seaters).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 2007 PRHT MX-5 is awesome! I love everything about my roadster. It handles and drives great! The power top is nice and the cockpit is much quieter than a soft top. Love the 7 speaker Bose system and the heated seats! Thanks Mazda for building such a fantastic car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fun car to drive. Lots of power from the 2 L engine. 6 spd manual box is smooth with accurate shifter. More fun to drive with the traction control switched OFF, when I remember as it defaults to ON at start-up, better for safety I guess. Limited slip dif is the only way to go. I like the styling and performance better than my previous MX5 which was a '91 with 1.6 L and 5 spd manual, no comparison really. Room in the '07 for a 6'2" driver, the '91 was cramped. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style, performance, very well balanced car. It handles like it's on rails, even if the pavement is less than perfectly smooth. Lots of storage in cockpit and trunk is reasonable size. Excellent gas mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased our car used in New Orleans with 7900 miles on it. We flew to New Orleans from Wa State to pick it up and drive it back home. We put 4K miles on the car in 2 weeks. We had to pack light but were able to get enough shorts and tops in it to make the trip. We averaged 31.6 MPG over the 4000 miles. We had no problems with the car or our backs and legs on the trip. The hard top helped with the noise as it was up most of the time on the freeways. I had read reviews about squeaks with the top and as soon as we drove off the lot I heard the same thing. Mazda in Wa. was able to fix with foam tape in the two receptors for the top at the top sides of windshield. Lots of Zoom Zoom!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>PRHT is great. The auto was a pleasure to drive. Gas mileage was very good. It is very fun to drive. While driving in July in La., Ms, In and Il the 4 cup holders actually came in handy!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I use this as my daily driver and commute before rush hour. The car is so much fun to drive and the mileage is a real plus. 36.9 mpg on my last road trip with the a/c on (top up). I even got 31 mpg on a high speed run (85-90 mph)? amazing!! The six speed gearbox is so amazing that I don?t mind getting caught by red lights? it gives me another opportunity to go through those gears!! Acceleration is exceptional if you really get on the gas, but still really good if you just go through the gears. With the top down, the day?s worries just float away. There is a surprising amount of space in the trunk. Interior space is ok for me at 6ft tall.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The PRHT is really a plus. The Bose mp3 sound system is more than adequate for my nuevo flamenco. Love the easy to read gauges. Heated seats make winter time top down enjoyable. Cockpit layout well thought out. Did I mention the six speed? Wow</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Driving this car brings me happiness as well as enjoy the sun shines. It allows not only to move from one point to another but gives you emotions and lots of fun with no speeding or dangerous driving. I have never had any problems or issues with my car given I had technical maintenance twice. The only thing you might care about is driving in mountains during the winter. But I did drive to Mt. Hood three times, so nothing is impossible. Just don't forget it's rear-wheel drive car with all its positives and a few negatives.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have been driving the MX5 PRHT for almost a year now and still love the experience. The only reason I get to drive is because my wife loves to be chauffered. The car is a real show stopper, everywhere we go someone is turning their head to see that car go by. As small as it looks any 6' person should be able to fit and get in and out comfortably. One complaint, I can't drive the car without breaking the law, it always wants more Zoom- zoom.</TEXT>

I have nothing but great things to say -- still getting 30 mpg and have had no problems with the car. The PRHT is perfect; interior/exterior finish still looks great; no issues requiring any service or repair; extremely fun to drive with plenty of responsiveness; 6-speed automatic works great; still an amazing vehicle. I still suggest that you go get one!! ;-)</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I decided to get rid of our motorcycle and buy a small sportscar, convertible. We bought our Mazda MX-5 the day after selling the cycle. This has been the best buy we ever made. We both love driving it and we drove it to the Great Smoky Mountains a couple of weeks after buying it. Had a ball driving in the Smokies with the top down. Can't compare with the motorcycle. No hot, wet, uncomfortable days with this toy. Should have bought one years ago.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's an awesome driving experience for this 67 year young kid in the Texas Hill Country and the ease it handles and hugs the road on the curves. I've only had it for two weeks and it's averaging right at 30 MPG. My neighbor told me that it's a motorcyle on 4 wheels. The six speed auto tranny is very smooth and I'm still learning the paddle shifting feature which is fun. I agree with others, that you do need to stop after a couple of hours and limber up. Mazda did a wonderful job on the exterior and interior design and the soft top is so easy to operate. I wish I'd done this 10 years ago. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car! Sure, it's not the most powerful or the flashiest, but it's just unbelievably fun to drive. The handling is very nimble and confidence inspiring, while still being comfortable enough for a 60 mi roundtrip commute. Acceleration is very good despite only having 166 hp, but don't expect to win many drag races. Having the security and added comfort of the PRHT was definitely worth it. The whole process only takes 12 secs! Sure, I could have gotten something with more power, "practicality" or better handling specs, but none in this price range can match the Miata's quality, driver-vehicle connection, and fun factor. I don't regret for a moment buying this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's my first Miata and I've had it only a couple of days. It's so much fun to drive in the Texas hill country. The 6 speed AT delivered 30 MPG on the first tank. The soft top is quick and easy to put up and down. Being 5'10", I've figured out how to get in and out without too much trouble. It has plenty of power and it hugs the road on our winding roads sharp curves. I must admit that my many of the owner reviews posted posted on this website aided in my decision to purchase the Miata.

<TEXT>Before buying our car, I read a lot of reviews here on Edmunds of people saying how wonderful their MX-5s were. These reviews helped me in deciding to get the true-red Miata MX-5 Grand Touring with splash guards and chrome fuel door over the competition. We've had our car about 10 days now and I can truly say this is the most fun car I have ever owned. The engineers at Mazda definitely got it right. It's obvious they've been doing this for 18 years. The car's lines are very sexy and pleasing to the eye and the performance will really get your heart beating. Now the only problem I face is arguing with my wife over who gets to drive the car today. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The cockpit layout, the sound quality with the Bose system, the acceleration, the handling on curves, the ease of shifting the six-speed, the ease of opening and closing the soft top and the engine purr. This car costs less than the competition, but performs better.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wanted something stylish and fun. It is all that and then some. My husband and I run to see who will get to the Miata first. Style and the retractable top makes it own statement. Not used to so much fast response, takes a second then you think, why not, no one is around. Blast to drive, great jaw dropper on many faces when that top retracts. Looks good, drives great, just a great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very nice roadster for the money. All the Miata driving traits carried to the next level, worthy successor to my '95 Miata. Superior handling, braking, manual shifting, cornering etc. But. I think Mazda blew some of these details: exterior styling rear end. Boring. Needs the spoiler just to get going. Front styling. The round hood shape is odd and visually distracting. Interior. Console cup holders are useless, should be storage with gas and trunk releases. Interior. No map pockets. Huh? Gas door release. Torturous location. Exterior colors. The cloth top is an ugly color. All of the body colors except black need to be richer, see Porsche. Side styling lacks character.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The driving experience and reliability. In spite of my styling dings, I think Mazda is headed in the right way, they just blew some details. Fuel economy. Exhaust note. Playfulness. Price. Wheel styles. Trunk light. Seats. Roll over bars and side air bags. Ease of manual top use. Speed. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>....all these years! Call it the "old" man's last hoorah - call it anything but call it fun! I got the marble white "Sport" convertible with extras. Takes a second or two for an elderly man to climb in with the top up but once in, he doesn't want to get out. The madam loves it too and calls it "Peanut." Never have I seen such a responsive engine for it's size and turning is a breeze - almost like a zero turn mower. Like others, I'd like a little storage where the console cup holders are and the two in the door either relocated. Guys, it's a shame I can't respond properly (age) to the viewing public who "lak dat car." I look to get the wife out of her big Buick into a red one real soon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car after having owned 3 Corvettes and 3 BMWs. It is more fun to drive than any of them. Not the power of the M3, but it does ok and the handling is superb. Ride comfort is just right for me. Not too hard like an M3 and not soft enough to screw up the handling. Mazda got it just right. A really fun car to drive with just the right touches in terms of features. Our options included sport suspension with 17" wheels and satellite radio. I would have ordered the premium package but instead bought this one off the showroom floor. The power hardtop is brilliant. Take heart guys, my wife loves to drive this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I used to have a Miata as a weekend car, but wanted a daily driver. The PRHT made the difference where I don't feel I have to compromise between a fun weekend car and an all-weather, year round daily driver. This car is the most fun to drive that I've ever owned and Mazda has provided a lot of comforts for a small sports car. The MX-5 even makes driving to work a blast!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is pure fun. Most bang for the buck. With the suspension package, traction control, and stability control cornering is superb and virtually no nose dive when braking. Ride is suprisingly smooth for such a short wheelbase and suspension package. The MX5 fits like a glove and everything is in its proper place except for the cup holders in the console which I have found to be a good place to stash gasoline receipts. The Copper Red Mica with tan leather has drawn nothing but compliments. Gas mileage is impressive returning 30 mpg in the first 600 miles of which only 200 has been highway driving. The convertible top is a marvel, just unlatch it and heave it over your shoulder.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great handling with a fairly comfortable ride. Easiest operating non power convertible top on the market. Steering wheel controls for sound system lets you keep eyes on the road at all time. Power is more than adequate and engine revs like crazy but still pulls well at low rpm in higher gears. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is a blast to drive, period! It's light, responsive, quick, and boy, does it corner! I test drove 4 on 3 occasions trying to decide which model. I got the GT PRHT in silver w/ black leather. Not my first choice by far in the beginning, but became my favorite by the end. Personally, the tan interior which was my 1st choice, kept looking cheaper the more I saw it. The black looks sharp and richer although it gets hot fast. I replaced a Ford Expedition with this, and good riddance! I'm done with big cars. If I need one, I'll rent it. I have so much fun driving the MX-5. Top up, down, tight, no room to move inside, noisy, bouncy, it's all good! It's even a bit throaty on the exhaust!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, responsiveness, and fun factor are huge pluse! Engine loves to rev and tranny well mated w/ paddles. Power hardtop is absolutely great! Considered softop, but glad I got the PRHT. Very well designed overall inside and out. Great choice on tone of silver paint. Decent mpg, no complaints.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really like the car. It truly is the most fun car to drive. I have had mine almost 6 months and I love it. The power hardtop is a must and works like a charm. I have the upgraded suspension with limited slip differential and traction control. The handling of the car is extremely balanced. The car has been flawless mechanically and the fit and finish is better than cars even in the next class. Power is very good but not exceptional - but I would rather have the mileage anyway. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a fun, good looking roadster but doesn't want to spend a fortune to get it. </TEXT>

<FAVORITE>Very easy to use top. Glass/defrost rear window. Engine, still rev-happy and a bit gruff (this is a roadster). The dual exhaust balances out the rear of the car. The 17" wheels fit the car nicely. This thing stayed as true to form as possible.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well as the title say, I have driven 3300 miles now. The car has been flawless, I took it back to the dealer to have the advanced keyless remote reprogrammed to lock the car if I move more than 2 feet from the car. The remote stays in my pocket and works great. The retractable hardtop has been flawless and is a work of art. The trunk is larger than my old S2000 and while the MX-5 would loose a race to the more powerful S2000, it is just as fun to drive. The 17 inch wheels look great and the brakes work very well. My only complaint is the Bose 6cd/mp3 radio does not display RDS data or scroll the mp3 titles. Other than that the car has been every thing I expected.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car! Plenty of power, great handling. Love the looks both inside and out. No problems, all maintenance has been very affordable, great dealer has been doing the maintenance for me. One flaw - very very very low quality plastics in the interior. The plastics scratch very very easily. In taking my laptop out of the passenger seat, it scratched the dash, also I've been putting my cell phone on the console near the power outlet and it too is scratched, just from being there. I'm hoping the company has a recall and they fix this - until then, it's the biggest bummer on such a FUN FUN FUN car!</TEXT>

I looked at other cars in its class but they did not have as much room and little to no trunk space. The MX-5 has a nice trunk and a storage area behind the seats that you can place items in. The cup holders on the doors makes it nice and allows you to shift the vehicle without worrying about hitting your drink.

That eliminated Porsches, BMW's, MB's and a number of other cars. I chose the MX-5 because it was not a compromise. It drives exceptionally, the new interior is first rate, the exterior restyle is spot on and I didn't have to sell a kidney to get it. What really sold me though is that this is what a sports car is. It reminds me of what made cars so important in my life and what made me want a car that was "special". The MX-5 is special. I can race this car if I choose, modify it to make it better or leave bone stock and it's just great. It's just perfect.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first roadster and let me say it is awesome. This car is just a blast to drive. I never considered the Solstice because it's a GM product and I couldn't get over it's "look at me" flashy design. The engine in the MX-5 is a gem, as is the transmission. I couldn't imagine buying this car with an auto. The handling is amazing, as is the top operation. This certainly isn't the fastest car I've owned, but with this car you don't need to be breaking the speed limit to have fun. It really is like driving an oversize go-cart, which is why I bought it. On top of that it's pretty practical for a Roadster, with a usable trunk and plenty of interior storage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 2.0l engine that revs like a dream; the 6-speed manual, best shifting transmission I've ever used, save for maybe an S2000. The go-cart like handling is a blast. The headlights are awesome; easily the brightest I've seen (easily better than our 03 Odyssey). Brakes are super strong, love the looks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my 2007 Miata PRHT for about 3 days now, but already find this to be an amazing vehicle. It's a real pleasure to drive and the PRHT is definitely worth the money -- much quieter than the soft top inside the vehicle. I've owned a 280ZX, an MGB, an Acura Integra LS, and most recently a Toyota Celica GTS. The Miata is far and away the most fun and responsive vehicle of the bunch. Go get one! ;-)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>PRHT, responsiveness, interior and (Copper Red) exterior finish and workmanship. Availability through S-plan. 28.5 MPG on 1st tank - 30.5 MPG on second tank with a 6-speed automatic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I only have a little over 100 miles on the car but so far I can tell you this is a true sports car. The handling is right in tune with a car of this type. Power and torque is there when you need it even with the auto transmission and paddle shifters. The ride quality is what you would expect from any good sports car. Firm! I had a 3 Series BMW before the MX-5 and it will give the BMW a run for its money in every way for about $9 grand less.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Without a doubt the PRHT is the favorite feature for me.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this car for 2 days now and I love it. I'm only 5'8" so space is not a big problem even though getting in an out of a low car is interesting. I feel the car fits likes a glove. The best word to describe this car is FUN! I live in the SF Bay Area and plan to drive this everywhere including along PCH1, Napa, and Santa Cruz. Having the retractable hard top is convenient and allows me to have a quieter ride if I prefer. It also provides a sense of security vs. a soft top. Be aware that the recommended fuel octane on this car is Premium (91 octane).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power retractable hardtop, simplicity of console controls, responsiveness, fun-factor, exhaust tone, advanced keyless system. Shifting is effortless.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only had this car for a little over a month. I have driven approximately 900 miles. 11,000 annual miles is a projection. I have ordered a SAT satellite radio and a CDC in-dash 6 disc CD/MP3 changer, but it has not been installed yet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I can't imagine more fun for the money, and the hard top is a nice feature. It's not an SC430 or an SLK, but if you want a classic roadster in the vein of an MG or Fiat Spyder with rock solid reliability and low cost of ownership, along with some measure of practicality like a usable trunk and excellent fuel economy, there's simply no better car on the market. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Retractable hard top, usable trunk, smooth short throw 6-speed manual transmission. Turning radius and handling are amazing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Although I've only had my MX-5 for a few weeks, driving it is already one of my favorite pastimes. It's a hunny... without a doubt. The power hard lid is just plain sweet. Looks, handling, power, and curb appeal are outstanding. Can't wait for warmer weather and mountain roads.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power hard lid is just plain sweet. The interior reminds me of my flying days. Power galore, handling, and road hugging is a huge thrill.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Outstanding all around vehicle. A sheer preasure to drive. Great handling, plenty of power, good build quality, good looks inside and out. Beats the competition, hands down! I drove the others and came back and bought the MX-5 Miata! 30 mpg! The top is a work of art! Greatly enhances look of the car. Wheels may be too large in diameter - may distract from overall appearance due to size. At first sight, eyes are drawn to wheels instead of car! At second glance everything seems to mesh and look good - have mixed emotions - not sure if a 16 inch wheel might have been better aesthetically. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling - pleasure of driving, engine, transmission, looks with hardtop, interior. A complete package - has it all!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Outstanding performance, ride, and looks. Smooth clutch and transmission! Plenty of power. Handling is outstanding. I drove the others (competition); none can match it for value, fun, or handling. Build quality far superior to low-end competition and as good or better than the high-end. The interior is beautiful and well made. I looked at and drove many of the competition and always came back to the MX-5 Miata. My first tank of gas produced 29.754 MPG. My second tank produced 30.1 MPG! I am working on the third. Everything works as advertised. The top is a work-of-art! It greatly enhances the overall look of the car. I have no problem with the cup holders - THEY HOLD CUPS!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>ALL! Complete package. Fun to drive. Great looks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Epitome of FUN,. from 1000 - 6500 rpm this 2.0 liter engine sounds suspiciously like the 3.6L boxer power plant from Porsche. The interior is much more exotic then any previous MX-5 with the dark tan/reddish leather. Just a all round fun car but it's hard to be your only car. Not great in winter. Great on gas, gets a LOT of looks. You get a $60,000 look for less than $30k. May cause younger age appearance.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exhaust Note, interior (red leather), 6 speed manual transmission, sat. radio, looks from other drivers, super easy convert top, tight steering feel, windscreen, heated seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The MX-5 with power hard top draws a lot of interest. The top works easily and I don't notice the extra weight. The trunk space isn't compromised either. With the top up, however, there is a huge blind spot on your left side so adjust the mirrors carefully. I'm six foot three and I fit comfortably. The copper red mica is attractive without screaming "look at me". The engine is willing and scoots quickly. The transmission shifts lightly, but even with the 6 speed, it seems like it needs another gear when cruising on the freeway. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The advantage of a hard top. It's quiet, seals well against moisture, and adds one more measure of security.</FAVORITE>
