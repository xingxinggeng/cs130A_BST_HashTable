<TEXT>The 6.7L diesel has major problems. The engine clogs. I have had the truck contantly into the shop. Dodge does not have parts available and does not seem to have a fix designed. The engine parts need to be replaced or cleaned constantly. The fuel economy and power drop with each trip to the dealer. I seriously recommend NOT buying a Dodge with this engine. I paln to try to get different truck via the lemon laws in our state. The truck has been in the shop for the same problem over and over and is going in again soon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned this truck for 16 months. Overall it has been a decent truck. The truck has been back to the dealer 3-4 times for emission problems. I feel this is an ongoing issue that may never be resolved on the truck.I use the truck to drive to and from work and to pull trailers on the week-ends.The truck works great for that.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my 2007 Dodge 3500 6.7 for a year and 12000 miles and love it. You need to drive these things like you are borrowing them ie. get on them! Helps to keep them clean, and is a lot of fun. Don't just drive them in town. I pull a 5th wheel rv with great ease and get 14mpg doing it, and 17-20 without it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my Ram for 15 months and have had to bring it to the shop a few times, but the dealership took care of it. I love this truck, tons of power, but marginal fuel economy. Avg 17mpg. I put a leveling kit and some beefier tires and with this winter weather in Washington I have been able to drive anywhere. We take long road trips every chance we get and our Cummins continues to purr. I love it</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is a the worst reliable truck I ever owned. It has been in the repair shop 8 Times with emissions problems, 1-rear end, and 1 front wheel hub. It appears these diesels made after Jan 2007 are a enviromental emissions nightmare and have to be serviced every 1,000 miles or they plug up the converter, egr valve, and egr cooler. They charge from $350-$1000 each time, I understand the 2008's have the same problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have not had very good luck with our 2007 6.7 cummins. We have had a lot of trouble from the particle filter. With my experience with diesels if it doesn't smoke something is wrong. Cannot make this truck smoke. Every 12,000 miles we have to have the particle filters cleaned. They say it is impossible to put a aftermarket chip in it. What you buy is what you get. Hope things level out on repairs.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I spec'd this out for my husband after extensive research. We have a small hot shot business and needed a powerful, yet reliable truck to pull goose neck flatbed trailers. The 6.7 L Cummins was the big draw. I did order the truck with some aesthetic touches that made it easy on the eye and set up good for long drives. We had the problem with the emission light coming on frequently, but that is resolved now. Pulls loads up to 9000 lbs without even knowing it is back there, including through the mountains of VA. In LOVE with the truck and it draws gawkers everywhere my husband goes to deliver loads. Other than the fuel mileage, it is AWESOME.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2007 Mega SLT 4x4 Diesel 2500 If you want luxury and comfort this might not be your truck, buy a Chevy LTZ. If you want reliability and performance this is it. I have driven them all numerous times. Ford is ok, Chevy is alright, Toyota is nice and Nissan is downright awful. The new Ford Diesel might be the answer they have been looking for, time will tell. Chevy has the tranny but the diesel is marginal. Toyota and Nissan do not offer a diesel. I will drive this truck for 200,000 miles to break it in and then go for another 400,000 before I start to even think about an engine problem. Towing is a breeze and the engine brake or "Jake Brake" is a huge plus. 6 speed auto tranny is great.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>The Big Red Truck</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I never owned a truck, but when I came back from Colorado I had to get one. I drove Fords and Chevrolets in Colorado for the company and all were quad cabs and extended cabs. I saw my crew's face after the hour and a half drive and they were not happy, from Meeker CO. to Grand Junction CO. I wouldn't be either! I returned last month with "The Big Red Truck" and I now have a crew of musky, dirty, well worked men who argue to take turns to ride in the cab. The truck drives like a charm. I couldn't see myself in a Ford, Chevy, or some foreign made truck, yet I wonder what would happen if I married my 6.7 Cummins to an Allison Transmission? More POWER?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my dodge {3500} for for nearly a year and love the truck. I had three Chevy's and one GMC prior, the power and performance were no where near comparable. I own a business in the construction industry and average 15 to 20 mpg depending on its use, I have pulled small excavators to loads of gravel and the cummins has pulled like a champ all the way. I have find it great on the highway, but rough very rough on gravel roads. I have had to replace the back window for leakage problems. visibility and maneuverability are ten out of ten compared with any truck I've ever driven. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a small business owner and I use the truck to haul a fuel transfer tank and tool box. I am pleased with the power of the Cummins. There is no noticeable loss in whether empty or loaded. My problem is the build quality. This truck is just over one year old an it has been in the shop more than my Chevy that has over 130,000 miles. They have replaced the rear diff. seal, the rear window, the main computer, and now my check engine light is on. All this on a vehicle with less than 32,000 miles. It becomes a hassle trying to run a small business when you cannot use your truck. I should have listened to my wife and bought a CHEVY!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the truck to tow a 6,000 lb travel trailer with room to upgrade to something heavier. Our first outing netted 13 mpg at the California mandated 55 mph towing speed limit. It achieves about 22 mpg sans trailer. The driver's door shudders on bumpy roads and is poorly sealed. The transmission shifts down quite hard when coming to a stop. Cruise controls are very awkward. Very rough riding. Love the Cummins 6.7 liter. It has yet to shift down out of 6th gear on cruise control. We now have 1500 miles on it and look forward to thousands more. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this truck because I wanted the durability of the Cummins 6.7L diesel. I travel a fair amount and the truck is very comfortable on the road. Fuel mileage has increased as I get closer to 10,000 miles. I average around 20mpg on the highway but down to 14.5 mpg in the city. I haven't had any problems with the truck except for the check engine light coming on and going off about every week or so. This is a big truck so can be a bit tight parkingin a shopping center lot but not unmanageable. Very comfortable on the road and really fun to drive</TEXT>

<TEXT>OK, I bought the left over 07, loaded, great price, rebates, so I paid less than I would have for a 08 1500 gasser. The fuel economy is fantastic! The engine will not even be broken it until about 10K miles and I am getting 20 on the highway and 16 around town! Power is fantastic, handling is tight and sure. I have the TRX4 package and the truck rides better than my 00 Durango! If you want a "real" truck..buy the 2500HD with the cummins!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my truck new about a year ago. I opted for the proven 5.9L Cummins and automatic transmission. Power is awesome and fuel mileage is great considering the size and weight of the truck. I average about 20 MPG mixed driving. The heaviest load I ever pulled was about 6000 LBS; you don't even know it is back there. I am 6'2" and love the roomy interior. Seats were comfortable on a 1100 mile trip. This is my fifth Dodge Ram and the second with a Cummins. Before I bought this one I test drove a Duramax. No comparison!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased my 2007 Ram Quad Cab 4x4 with the new 6.7 Cummins. Wow what a powerful machine. The 325hp is apparent when you hammer the throttle. Mileage wise not to bad either 15/18 only 4,000 miles on it so should get better as it breaks in. Comfortable seats but agree with other reviews that the material is a little soft. See over time how it wears.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th brand new ram since 2000. The cummins is deffinetly the best of all diesels. It's proven itself several times with its towing, fuel economy and dependibilty. Not to fond of the new look of both the interior and exterior. The tires completely kill the look of the truck. My last ram was a Hemi sport and it definetly killed me having to upgrade to a pickup that doesn't look very appealing. Need to have a sport option and a darker color interior. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After extensive analysis and research I opted to buy one of the last new 5.9 Cummins diesels. What a truck! It is like piloting a freight train. The power is truly awesome. We took the truck on a 1,400 mile trip and got 19 mpg going 75+ with the A/C on. It is very high off the ground. Side steps may be mandatory for some folks. The range on a tank of fuel is amazaing as well - over 600 miles. Got the "Big Horn" package and like all the "Heavy Duty" features. Of course the Sirius Radio is great and the seats are comfortable. The motor is truly and engineering masterpiece. I am glad I purchased one of the last relatively un- smogged Diesels. I fear the enviro reg's may ruin these.</TEXT>

<TEXT>5.7L Cummings is very powerful, as much power as we'll ever need. Carry a 11ft loaded truck camper, had to add stabilizer, still needs airbags, squishy ride with big load, but still lots of power left in the Cummins. Lots of storage is great, fold down back seat is used frequently, can fit 2 kids and a big dog in the back seat easily. Needs more comfortable seats, no lumbar support and very hard. Tough on long trips, but the mileage with camper loaded is 14 including mountain passes. Empty commuting is getting 20-21 (75% freeway/25% in town). Not sure what it is on road trips w/o camper yet. Electrical system easy to wire to add things, simple. Too tall, need to have a stepstool to get in</TEXT>

<TEXT>The best truck I ever bought (5.9 L Cummins). Fuel economy 18mpg city and nearly 20mpg highway with full cargo in the back after only 500 miles. Suggest filling tires with more air.

<TEXT>This is the first Chrysler product I have owned and I am surprisingly pleased with the overall quality. The Cummins is very reliable and powerful. Used the plug in heater during the winter and had no problems with cold morning starts. As for traveling, my kids love the space in back. Trips are not a problem anymore. Mind you, this is a huge truck. Compact parking spots are not an option. Yet for the interior room and carrying capacity, I can walk the extra few feet. Entry and exit with the 4x2 is much easier than the 4x4. Although it is a truck, the ride is quite comfortable and the diesel noise is not overbearing. Fantastic buy. I am now hooked on Dodge.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Dodge Ram, but I am not Dodge loyal. We spend too much money on vehicles to blindly buy one brand over another. I test drove the new Chevy and looked at the Fords. Ford diesel scares me due to the notorious problems, and the Chevy's new interior was undesirable, at least to me. Mine is the 5.9l Diesel, but that was not selectable above. So far I've been on several trips, and the fuel mileage has gone up with every fill up. Currently I am getting 19.5 mpg hwy and 13 mpg city. My commute is only 4 miles with 6 stop lights so my city mileage is absolute worst case scenario. The Cummins is a great add on; resale and reliability of the diesel makes the extra cost worth it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Cummins just feels unstoppable. I've towed excavators, a boat, and my BBQ pit. Truck loves to work. Fuel mileage is great for a 4WD rig of this size. The Mega cab is HUGE, and the back seat is enormous. he back seat reclines, offering even more comfort for longer trips. Interior is quiet.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I feel this truck is solid and very fun to drive. A real head turner. I purchased the truck to be a daily driver and some farm work. I am satified with the fit and finish on delivery as well as the mechanicals. The 6 speed is fun to drive and great on fuel. With short shifting and a lite foot I am consistently at 20-24 cty and 19.5 - 20.1 on the highway. If I lead-foot it is at 18. I am hoping for a longterm ownership and with only 800 miles I am satified. I did have to bring the tires up to 80psi as the dealer had tires at 52 psi. I saw an increase in mileage thereafter. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the '07 2500 Quad Cab SLT 4X4 with the 5.9L Diesel not the new 6.7L. It rides like a 3/4 ton truck but turns like a 1/2 ton. The inside is a truck interior not some amalgam of luxury sedan and big rig. I'm driving on the I-5 daily doing 70- 75MPH as well as Cali stop go traffic and averaging 16.5-17.5 MPG with 500mi on the engine. First tank was 492.2mi for 32 gallons of diesel(34gal tank) and that was with me enjoying the power of the truck, that works out to 15mpg. As the engine breaks in my gas mileage will just get better and that's important in California when gas is $3.30 but diesel is $3.15. For a daily driver I'm pretty happy! </TEXT>

<TEXT>The biggest selling point of this vehicle for me was the Cummins 5.9 and the transmission that they have paired with this truck. It really felt better than the competition and it's impossible to ignore the reputation of that Cummins engine. It is fun to drive even though the ride is a bit rough on the kidneys if the road is less than perfect. A nice seat cushion with memory foam has really helped that situation. I am averaging 18-21 mpg which is impressive for a big 4X4. The experts say that after reaching 10k miles both power and mileage should improve...sounds great to me. The turbo responds nicely to all driving conditions I have encountered. So far, I have really enjoyed this truck!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently bought a 2007 2500 Dodge truck with a sticker price of $47745. It's a laramie 4x4 diesel quad cab long bed. I can't believe how cheap this truck is built. Most of all the chrome wheels and the chrome front bumper is fake. The Dodge people should be ashamed of how much they charge for these trucks. This truck should cost $10 to 15k less then the fFrd or Chevy trucks. This truck gets12.6 miles per gallon. There is at least 25 to 30 more options that come on the F250 lariet or the 2500hd LT3 for the same price or less. This is my first new Dodge pickup I would never buy another Dodge.
