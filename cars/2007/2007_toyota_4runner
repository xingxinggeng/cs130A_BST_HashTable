<TEXT>As a road warrior moving from an Acura RL to an SUV, I have been very surprised at how much I have enjoyed this vehicle. I typically drive 1,200 miles per week and with the exception of brake pads and tires, this truck has asked for nothing but gas. On that note, I have been tracking the mileage for the past 30k miles and I'm averaging 20.9 MPG - not bad for a V8.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V8 power, reasonable fuel economy, good driving position and stock stereo.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>For years, the 4Runner has been a popular SUV in TX. I bought a 2005 V6 SR5 and liked it, but traded it in for this SE V8 so I could pull a RV travel trailer. Went with the upgraded JBL audio system and leather. Love the sunroof. The engine is a solid performer and accelerates nicely when needed. Exterior aesthetics are nice. Everyone who has ever ridden in it has been impressed. I expect to drive this well past 150K miles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4WD is handy for back country usage. Towing capacity is nice. Very comfy ride for a truck. JBL audio system is nice. Like having the MP3 player plug, which I use with my Sirius Satellite radio.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second 4Runner. I just traded in my 2000 4Runner SR5 for this used 2007 Sport model. I loved the 2000 model and it was reliable but I had to trade it in after having a catalytic converter issue. This 2007 Sport model is great. The ride is much smoother than the 2000. The seats are more comfortable. Great stereo. Really like all the compartments and the MP3 connection. Still love the sunroof and the rear window that goes down. This SUV is solidly built with no rattles. Was originally looking for a black model but got the Mica Gray instead after seeing it. This 2007 model confirms my belief that Toyota makes the best cars at the best prices. I will drive them forever!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is driven north of the 60th parallel. From -50 to +35 it has proven it's worth many times over. Up here our roads are so rough that it seems like your off roading every time you pull out of the driveway. Did I mention that the City of Yellowknife only does snow removal once a winter (7 months long) and never plows on a pro-active basis. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I couldn't be more happy with my choice. The 4Runner rides so well. It is so quiet and smooth and "Lexus like." It seems like a luxury SUV. No problems. Best car/SUV I have ever had. No issues, problems or complaints. Engine is very powerful. Maybe, they can make it even more powerful and with even better gas mileage. Here's hoping for miracle technology.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th Toyota and 2nd (and last) 4 Runner. The entire cab rattles; including the annoying squeaks in the dashboard; plastic on plastic rubbing. This is the first Toyota I have ever had that had rattles. I have had it 21 months and the rattles started the 6th month. I have a total of 20,000 miles on it. I took it in to the Indianapolis dealership I bought it from and they told me that they were not going to be able to fix all the rattles. Are you kidding me! Next vehicle purchase will be an Acura.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had a 2005 Honda CRV, while it was okay, it rode rough, felt every single bump and crack in the road so I was on a mission to find a more comfortable ride that had enough roof clearance to hold 2 large parrot cages buckled into the back seat and enough space in back for our suitcases and such. I test drove the Mazda suv-rode like the crv did, loved the style of xterra but the ride was lacking also. The 4runner was the best ride! On occasion my dad or our grandson travels with us and the backseat has very limited leg room so can't say I would choose the 4runner if we had a larger family, but for dh & i and our feathered kids, its ideal, after all, parrots don't need leg room!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2001 SR5 4Runner which I had purchased new. The style, and additional room inside and out makes this a far nicer ride than the 2001. I am averaging 20.1 mpg, with the majority of miles being local. This is better than the old 4Runner, even though there was a boost of 30hp in the V6 engine.This is my third 4Runner, and I have never experienced any problems with any of them. I see no need to ever get rid of this 07, since Toyota offers unsurpassed reliability, and this 4Runner offers everything that I need.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had several SUVs prior to this starting with a 2000 Mercedes ML320 which I got rid of under the lemon law. Then 2002 Envoy, then 2003 Trailblazer both of which had transmission problems. 2005 I purchased 4 runner sport 6 cyl No problems. 2007 purchased 4 runner sport 8 cyl which actually does better with mpg. Not very stylish but love the comfortable drive does well in 4x, handles great. ample storage in rear including room for a full size wheel chair. Just wish the dash lights were no so hard to read during the day.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love my 4Runner. I average ~22 MPG and this has been fantastic in all weather. Living in a hilly part of the southern tier of NY the traction control and amenities are on par with cars costing up to 15K more. Considered the BMW X3 and it was no comparison. The interior space and comfort is fantastic for the money. I have never owned such a comfortable vehicle. Even the little features like the speed adjusting airfoil for the sunoof just make the driving experience and daily use a real pleasure. The control of the rear window is another great feature to help cabin airflow. The cargo mounted mirrors are a great help when backing up in close quarters.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The aux audio input and in dash MP3 player makes a fantastic 1-2 punch and make long trips easier. The sunroof is just the right size and the operation is smooth, fast, and quiet. The seats are exceptionally comfortable and supportive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 2007 4 Runner (V-8) is getting between 19 and 22 mpg and can still give a coupe a run for the money. I am very very happy with my 4 Runner! And I've owned other SUVs in the past. Other then my 2002 Highlander (I gave to my daughter) this is the best one I've owned yet. I think if you take good proper care of it, you too should get great results. Just my opinion! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted to wait to write a review until I had my 4Runner a year. I drive appx. 30000 per year so I needed a comfortable vehicle. My only major complaint is the handling in windy conditions. That might be inherent of this type of vehicle, though. If I keep my foot out of it, my gas mileage improves greatly - 24 MPG. Overall, I love the look and performance .</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 4runner 4 months ago after looking at and test driving several SUVs. Initially I wanted a Highlander, but the dealership did not have the one I wanted in stock. They convinced me to test drive the 4runner and I was sold as soon as we drove off the lot. We live in the Northwest where there is a lot of snow and hills. This SUV handles extremely well in the snow with the traction control and stablility control. I went from a 1998 Toyota Camry which I loved, but will never go back to another sedan after owning the 4runner. The over the top safety features and the way the vehicle handles make me feel very safe and in control. The only complaint I have is the stock stereo is crap.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really love this vehicle. My list of cars I have owned is as follows (for understanding purposes): Chevrolet Citation Toyota 4WD SR4 - with roll bar fun! Mustang 2000 coupe For the first time since owning my toy4wd I really like driving. This vehicle owns the off-road equally with the on-road. I can go off-roading to meet up with friends to shoot shotguns or cruise for malls for the girlfriend to shop at - hehe. Throw your snowboard and snow chains and gear in and go. My average MPG is min of 20. Acceleration is great - when some jerk is blocking - u can actually put the pedal to the metal and get around them. My 1 gripe is the AC controls are slightly annoying. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fast acceleration when u need it, and the 4wd performance is awesome. At first it seemed acceleration lagged in response - but seemed to improve over time. Someone told me the shifting learns - maybe so. I like how it has been working for me over last 10k. 4wd is perfect. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Replaced a 2000 Isuzu Trooper. Was going to buy a smaller vehicle, but when I drove the 4Runner I was sold. Amazing ride and handling, yet very capable off-road. Fuel economy for body-on-frame SUV has been very reasonable at 22-23 mpg on highway, 18 mpg in town. Towing is impressive even with V-6. Tows my 4,500lb boat fairly easily. I like the fact that this is a no-bling vehicle that does what its supposed to do without excuses.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice level of standard equipment, even in SR5. Smooth ride. Surprisingly decent fuel economy, off-road ability. Base stereo isn't bad either. V-6 gives effortless power.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This 4Runner has been in the dealership 4 times for steering vibration / flutter / pulsing. The area Toyota technical rep has been working with the dealership to determine and fix the problem. They keep changing and re-road force balancing the tires and nothing works. They tell me that this vibration is normal for the vehicle and they are just tring to get the best set of tires that give the least vibration. It seems that it is not possible for it to be fixed. Toyota quality is not what I thought. An unhappy owner with 2000 miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It was a toss up between ML 350 and the 4Runner. The MB has very poor reliability but the Toyota has no luxury options such as GPS. Sat on the fence for months until I came across a nearly new dealer demo I couldn't pass up. Very happy with it so far. It's like choosing between the hot, high maintenance person or the plain all around good person. One is much easier to live with.</TEXT>

The first 4Runner I owned had the JBL Synthesis 10 speaker system in it and it could blow you away. This 2006, I paid no attention and ended up with the basic head unit and basic speakers. Thousands of dollars later, I have aftermarket.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After months of research I purchased the 4Runner, and couldn't be happier. The look, feel, and quality of the vehicle is exceptional. This is not a haul your family around SUV (get a highlander if you need that). This is a true, rugged, go anywhere, drive over anything SUV. Ride quality is exceptional for a truck based SUV, gas mileage is very good as well. Resale value is through the roof, and if you opt not to trade in after your term is up, you can get 200k miles easy. Short of driving it off a cliff, it just might outlast you. Can be a little tough getting in/out for taller people, but this is an off road truck, not a minivan. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded in an 05 Ford Supercrew for the 4Runner. The F150 was simply too long to park in our side entry garage. The 4Runner is sized just right and is easier to maneuver and park. Excellent inside and out. The interior looks and feels expensive, way superior to our old Ford. It gets better mileage than the F150 but has less interior room. It's not the best family vehicle but it will have to do for now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After looking at every SUV out there we decided on the 4Runner mainly because of Toyota's reliability. The back window is great if you have dogs! We love everything about the car. There is one problem that we have found, when we first got the vehicle there was a constant rotten egg smell, it since has gone away for the most part but is still there occasionally. We have tried different grades of gas and nothing seems to help. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This SUV has been in the dealership 5 times for excessive vibration and rear end clunking and not been fixed yet. I've even had the Toyota technical rep look at it. The clunking in the rear end is a known defect in the SUV which according to the technical rep Toyota is not going to fix. If you get it you'll just have to live with it. We thought the vibration was fixed with a new set of tires but that ultimatly did not fix the problem. Toyota quality is not what it's advertised to be.

<TEXT>Purchased in Jan. and loved it, but now it's 12,000 miles later. Inside is very small, comfortable in the front seat means no leg room in the back. I am only 5'11" and I hit my head almost every time I get in. 3rd row seats create an even bigger blind spot. Seats aren?t too comfortable on long trips. Gas mileage is very poor when traveling at highway speeds. It's a nice SUV but not made for families, we wish we would have waited for the new Highlander.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 6 months of reading reviews on SUVs, picked the 4Runner. My second choice would have been the FJ Cruiser. Have had for 9 months and have had no problems at all. This is the first new vehicle I've owned that has not been in the shop at least 3 times the first 6 months for repairs and/or adjustments. Mileage is 19 MPG city and 22 to 23 on the road. It's enjoyable to have a ride that only requires gas and oil changes. The vehicle I replaced was a 1988 S-10 Blazer purchased new; it was a great truck but the new Trail Blazers just did not impress me as being a SUV. The 4Runner is great in our Minnesota snow and ice, 4-wheel drive and traction control perform well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first SUV and this is a great choice. Refined ride, great power, smooth transmission and a responsive V8 make a very capable vehicle that can tow a ton, handle any weather, and full time 4WD make it very safe in any conditions. The steering is a bit unresponsive, but once you get used to it, you feel secure in it. The iterior is well made, the leather seating is not as supple like some, but seems to be built more for duribility. MPG is good for a V8. I average 17.9 with mostly stop and go driving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>2700 miles and looking forward to trading it in. Good looking basic transportation. Unable to get side curtain airbags, daytime running lights, sunroof, 4x4, 3rd row seats in CA. Told these safety features weren?t necessary. In CO could get side curtain airbags,day time running lights,3rd row seats w/o sunroof. Opted for sunroof, 3rd row only good for midgets. 10 year old Discovery handled better in tight fast paced LA traffic. 4Runner feels unsure and at times throws a few surprises driving at higher speeds. I never know how the vehicle is going to react to various road condition at freeway speeds. This is the first vehicle I?ve had this problem with. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the 2007 4Runner because my 2001 SR5 was an incredibly reliable SUV and didn't cost me a dime to maintain other than routine work. The 2007 is better in every way. Handling, freeway ride, road noise dampening, stereo, interior comfort are all improved. As for the storage capacity, what you see before buying is what you get. Most people don't need more or they would be buying a larger SUV. The 4Runner is a perfect size for its intended market. It is not designed to haul 6 passengers. The third row is a compromise for those who need extra seating for small children only. It is bonus space and shouldn't be viewed as Toyota's failure to provide adequate seating for 6 adults.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We are a family of six and when it comes right down to it our decision to purchase the Toyota 4Runner came down to three main components: safety, reliability and fuel economy. We downsized from a Ford Expedition to the 4Runner because the rising gas prices were cause for concern. Overall we do not regret our choice, as there is no comparison to the quality and safety of a Toyota. We will keep our Toyota for years to come, but with a family of six it will probably be relegated to our second vehicle. We find that the 4Runner will meet our needs in a pinch as a family hauler, but trying to fit four children, two are still in car seats is uncomfortable put politely. Next time think minivan.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We love the exterior style, along with the quality and safety of the 4Runner. The moonroof has to be one of our favorite features and we rely on the outdoor temperature gage. The onboard fuel gage is neat as it monitors miles per gallon and can tell you how many miles are left in your tank.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my new (and first) 4Runner for two months and just finished two long road trips in it. The first was to Idaho (1500 miles round trip) and the second was to Yosemite (700 miles round trip). What a great truck! I've previously taken my Highlander and Camry on these trips, but the 4Runner is by far the most comfortable way to go. It has a great ride, plenty of room, and averaged between 20 and 26 mpg, depending upon the terrain I was driving in (I've got the 6 cylinder). Ran the air the whole time since it was middle of summer, and no problems. I read all of the reviews here before I bought, and they were right-on with pros and cons, as I'll detail in the two sections below. I'm a fan!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great, great ride, especially for a truck! Good gas mileage for the size/power. Plenty of power, and plenty of room in storage area. I've got the Sport Edition, and I really like both the exterior and interior styling. All of my neighbors have come by to tell me the same thing! I have Shadow Mica.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our first Toyota 4Runner and so far we love it. It's amazing how much reliability, performance, and luxury we're getting for the price. We bought it towards the end of Q1'07 when toyota was trying to beat GM in number of sales, so we got a pretty good deal. Granted fuel mileage could be better, but hey, with all the other features we're getting, we can't complain.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling. Reliability. Sunroof. Leather interior. Interior comfort. Low road noise.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded a 2001 SR5 for this new LTD. The difference in feel is tremendous. The 01 was a great vehicle, and never cost us any money in repairs. The 07 looks better, has more front seat room, and drives really tight. I don't see how Toyota can improve on this model. I kept the last one almost 6 years, and I'm sure down the road I'll be buying another 4Runner! Can't beat the reliability!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats are more comfortable. 5 speed auto is a real improvement, JBL synthesis sound system is outstanding. Power is more than enough, and exterior styling is great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Although I only just purchased the SR5 model, I love it! I previously had an 01 Explorer - what a difference. The handling is much better and I can't believe that is doesn't feel truckish. So far I seem to be getting really good fuel mileage. I repeat, love this SUV!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Radio controls at my finger tips on the steering wheel. Also, I love the way the interior looks, the instrument panel, etc. Rear window rolling down!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As a Realtor, I needed a vehicle that can get into interesting places, regardless of weather, be safe and reliable, and also present a good professional image. I deliberately chose the mid-level Sport Edition - I liked the larger disc brake rotors, the X-REAS suspension, the cloth seats, and the side tube steps. We special ordered ours. I wanted the navigation system, side airbags and sunroof primarily. The 4Runner is the ONLY vehicle that I've had (including Jaguar, Mercedes, Mazda, Volvo, Honda and Nissan that was (and has been) absolutely flawless. Great driver and 4WD system.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine and transmission torque, power delivery and smoothness; superb intuitive navigation system. The 4Runner performed superbly in a protracted snow/ice accumulation we had during the winter. The large exterior mirrors really provide good rear visibility regarding adjacent vehicles.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Pros - a nice ride. Handles well with good acceleration. Cruises nicely at 65 - 70 mph at 2,000 rpm. Avg miles per gallon = 21.5. No vibration of steering wheels over 2,000 rpms as others have suggested. Good radio with great reception. 17" wheels a real plus. Putting the back window down decreases buffeting air when drivers window is down and sunroof open. Cons - brakes a bit weak and seats are harder than my retired highlander.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>17 inch wheels, acceptable road noise, automatic rear window, self adjusting radio to compensate for noise level, estimated mileage of fuel in tank - 445 miles when full.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall a good truck, better on gas than most SUVs. Downfalls are it floats on the highway, a lot of blind spots, especially the 3rd window and the wide panel between the 2nd and 3rd. The roof is very low or the seats are high, if you have a kid in car seat, expect to hit there head a few times. The trunk is so heavy and they need to add extra assistance to close it, not at the end when you actually get it down. I'd love to see a dual sunroof. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I searched for 4 weeks (which is highly unusual for me) for the perfect luxury mid-sized SUV. I narrowed it down to the H3, the Land Rover LR2 and the Acura RDX. I ruled out the H3 due to the reaction I got from everyone I told. The LR2 had no incentives and are ridiculous with their pricing and I was on my way to by the RDX when I passed the Toyota dealer. After seeing and driving the 4Runner, there wasn't a doubt in my mind that was the one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It looks amazing in black with the spoiler. Interior quality is fabulous. Love the space. Rear and front entry is easy. The drive! It's like a car! Can take regular OR premium fuel. Nav, blue tooth, too much more to list! Love it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I narrowed my SUV search to the Toyota 4Runner, the Nissan Pathfinder and the Nissan XTerra. I chose the 4Runner because of comfort of driving and historical reliability. The 4Runner, despite being on a truck frame, delivers an exceptional ride. It's quiet and tight. You can just tell that it has 150 to 200K miles of driving in it. Although it was a little more expensive than the Nissans, I think it was well worth it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I transport equine medical emergency cases pulling a large horse trailer and find the 4-Runner excellent in doing this job. With the 4x4 going out into the pastures is not a problem or worry (to date that is). The only thing I do not like is the location of the electric window switches - they should be located much higher to be easily accessible. Mileage is about 20hwy/17city. One other thing I don't like is the way the Toyota emblem looks. Overall this truck is great in the field and for evenings out on the town for dinner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We test drove the Highlander over New Years and put over 1200 miles on it. When we came back we decided on a 4Runner instead. It had a more rugged design and feel inside, like an SUV should, but the handling felt almost the same as the highlander (built on a Camry frame). So far, with almost 2500 miles on it, gas mileage has not been that different either (avg. 19 city 25 hwy). This is a great SUV with great standard comfort features. I would suggest looking at a different vehicle if you want a 3rd row seat though. The seats fold up along the side instead of fold flat into the floor. They can get in they way often when trying to load cargo.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Happy to be part of the 4Runner family. I researched just about every mid-size SUV out there and the 4Runner is the superior vehicle in just about every way. Smooth and powerful V6, great ride, sharp styling, quality materials, great fit and finish and Toyota reliability. Check out what people are getting for '97 4Runners and that'll tell you how well they hold their value. Take advantage of the cash rebate and get yourself into a 4Runner. Just make sure you get it with the Michlines as the Bridgestones and Dunlops do not get good reviews.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased my first new car ever and my 3rd 4runner (first baby on the way!). I have always been a used car guy, can't stand new vehicles depreciating 10 - 20% the moment you drive it off the lot. But if any SUV holds it value and limits "day one depreciation" its the 4Runner. My first 2 4Runners, an 87 and a 94 with combined mileage of 565K were rock solid and my new 07 holds true. Much better ride and handeling in this new version thanks to an increase in 4 inches in width. The 4WD V6 is plenty powerful for my driving needs and the sport package looks sharp. Averaging 19 MPG - wish could be better. Only complaint is that its my wife's and future child's daily driver and not mine.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fit and finish is superb, bullet proof reliability, smooth gear shifting, very quiet interior. Ride and comfort is excellent, dash layout is excellent and tilt/telescopic steering wheel accommodates all size drivers. Oil filter and drain plug location is very very convenient for "do-it-yourselfers".</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm very happy with my 07 4Runner SR5 4X4. This SUV does everything well. V6 has plenty of power (recommend V8 if you tow). The ride is very smooth and handling is excellent for a truck based SUV. I compared the 4Runner with all the competition and it is obvious that Toyota has the upper hand in quality. If you never venture offroad, other SUVs may better suit your needs. The 4Runner 4X4 has serious offroad capability without sacrificing a smooth ride and comfort. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After only having my 4Runner for 6 months I can say it is a fun SUV to drive, it handles like a car, looks great, runs great and is quiet except for a slight vibration effect or noise when it's windy, it seems like wind blowing or buffeting against something. That comes and goes and is not annoying, just a little disconcerting at first. The turning ratio is easy and good, I've taken it off road (4x2) and it was fun, fun, fun.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the back windshield wiper, the cargo area tarp, and the extra voltage outlet in the back. Also, the center console storage area is deep, and includes a coin sorter/holder.
