<TEXT>Just sold my 2007 Versa after 39000 miles and 38 months. I am sad to see it go as it was a great car. Inexpensive to buy, great mileage (32 mpg), reliable, and fun. I have never had a car with as good a drivers position and/or visibility. As a fun and well-built people mover, it has no equal; certainly not the Fit or Yaris; it is in a class by itself. It served me well and never complained. Good job Nissan. Thanks Versa.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drivers position and visibility, auto express up and down, huge cabin, quality interior materials for the segment, steering feel, true versa-tility.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well,bought the car in January 07.Refused to buy the cvt transmission as it was untested. Man am i glad reading the other reviews. Seems these cvt's are junk!Our 5 speed auto runs great. We get 30mpg city summer/winter. Traded a5yr old Xterra which was a great car with bad mileage. The only trouble we have had is in getting the underbody wash at the car wash in the winter.Water got into the fuel tank breather and froze solid. Dealership replaced everything under warranty including the charcoal canister. Don't get the underbody spray anymore! Weird smell when you turn on heater. Taking it back for clunk in front end. Whole front just feels loose. All in all half the price of the Xterra twice the mileage</TEXT>

<TEXT>While I haven't reached sticker highest is 35 lowest is 29 in 20K miles with routine service (in NJ with crappy winter gas, traffic & horrible roads). I've had a few trim piece issues but that's it (haven't lost a hub). Bought it to carry lots of stuff (does), get good hwy mpg for my commute (does), comfortable seats (yep), cheap payment (you bet), not breakdown (doesn't). One errant pass airbag rattle that only comes out in winter would be my only nagging complaint, but even that is seasonal. Keep tires @ correct pressure and light won't come on; duh. Easy oil changes for the DIY types like myself. A- from me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Radio/speakers - I upgraded to the SL only CD changer/aux - brilliant. Light years ahead of my '97 Jag system. Seats are WAY comfortable. My commute + old Hyundai led to lower back problem - gone now. Easy fold rear seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Versa hatchback in 9/06 after looking at the Matrix, Fit and Mazda 3. I have never had a problem starting the car, and I find it quite peppy and fun to drive. There are, however, the "little things" that have bothered me about this car that even an economy car shouldn't fall short on: 1. the tire pressure warning light has been on since day 2; 2. 4 wheel covers have fallen off due to low quality plastic pins; 3. the interior cabin gets quite hot from (i'm guessing) engine heat coming thru the ventilation system; and 4. trim pieces have come unglued. Finally, like other reviewers, I have also been disappointed by the gas mileage from this small car: typically 27 city; 30 hwy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Use this car as my get to work car( 60 miles) and tight parking car. Have a Nissan Quest also. Have driven this car hard, and at 40,000 miles it is going great. I got it at a good price, just like my other Nissan. This car is designed to be left alone( except for fluid changes) for a long time. Oh, and if you lose a hubcap it will cost you over 60 dollars ( rip)!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handles great, does not seem to light in heavy weather. I get 30 miles to gallon all around miles of hard driving. Six gears does the job!I would buy all of my teenage drivers ( 3 in all) one of these if I had the cash.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car with fuel mileage in mind. I sacrificed ride and comfort for what I thought was going to be great mileage. Bottom line, big mistake! I live in Iowa and during winter my average mileage was 16 city and 24 hwy, now that it's summer I am getting 18 city, 26 hwy which is a full 10 mpg under what it was suppose to be. I am also experiencing problems with the check engine light coming on and losing power at higher speeds. I can not trust this car on the interstates. It rides rough too. Bottom line very bad mistake!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car because Nissan stated that it got 36 mph and 30 miles per gallon in the city. I only get 16 miles per gallon in the city and 29 on the freeway. The auto fuel sensor has broken twice and it has been replaced under warranty. I was told the repair would improve mileage but it did not. It's a comfortable car to drive if you can afford the gas.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was the first car I ever bought brand new. I wanted something roomy that got good gas mileage. The car was great at first but after 15,000 miles the breaks create massive amounts of dust that make the car squeal loud everytime I break. The hubcaps are cheap and fall off and the dealership took advantage of the fact that I did not know how much hubcaps cost and charged me $65.... for one. Every now and then the car won't start. I try again and then it will start. The MPG is okay but has decreased severly at 37,000 miles. My biggest issue is the tire pressure. My tires loose about 8 pounds every week. I refill them and within a week they have lost pressure again. Very Aggravating.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought it for a company car. Needed solid dependability and great gas mileage. Every one who drives it, loves it. Big enough to carry full size adult American males comfortably and go along with the traffic flow. Keyless entry and Bluetooth add to business ease of use. Owned it first month and put on 3,000 Florida highway miles with no additional problems other then fuel door release cable hangs down and was never properly installed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked for a year for a car I could fit in at 6'5", 225 pounds and with my limited budget. In the end, flipped a coin and went with resale value. Not nearly as much fun to drive as my 99 Accent, but it's nice to sit high so I don't have to change lanes for every truck that comes by. Top heavy car, tons of interior space, crappy speakers, looks cute, good color, good price. Haven't gotten used to the 6 speed yet, I have to shift down to third or fourth on all the corners, sluggish first year. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Fell in love with the car at first sight. Liked the features in the SL and was sold on the CVT tranny. Have 770 miles on the car. Just returned from a trip -27.6 on the road (on cruise) 22 around town - VERY disappointed. Had Maxima before and got better mileage. Also own a 03 Accord (4 cyl) and get 32.8 on cruise doing 75 mph. Maybe with break-in the mileage will improve a bit, but not that much. Nice car, but they should be more truthful about the mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I test drove everything out there $5K above and below the price of the Versa and were hard pressed to find anything that truly compared. Leg, head and foot room are amazing in both the front and rear seats and the ride is that of a car two classes higher. Ride noise is minimal at worst and handling is better than most in this size group. The car was suppose to be a third car, one my wife could use to show clients properties way out of town, but has quickly become the vehicle of choice for the first one out of the house in the morning. If you're considering a Fit, Civic, Corolla, Matrix, Focus or anything of the such, give the Versa a try and see the value for yourself.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car as a whole is great but to narrow down a few would be short changing those not listed. However, the Bluetooth capability, CVT and smart key are the top three shared by my wife and me.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I looked at the Versa, the Fit and the Yaris, and for me this was the best of the three for several reasons including available features, safety rating, performance and roominess. CVT was a plus, as well as the larger gas tank size. It's fun to drive and cute to look at. It looks and feels a lot more expensive than the sticker price. It gets loud when accelerating to higher speeds, but once speed is achieved, the ride is smooth and quite. Wish ABS was available without adding additional equipment. For mixed highway/city driving I get about 32 mpg, and that's improving each time I fill up. It's a great commuter car that's easy on the budget, well designed and one of the best in its class.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my Versa for about seven months, and I have been delighted with it so far. My previous car was a BMW 3, which was getting too expensive to own. Obviously the Versa doesn't have the performance capabilities of the BMW, but I still find it fun to drive in daily use. I special-ordered mine with ABS, and I am glad I did -- I have felt it kick-in when stopping quickly on wet pavement. I test-drove the auto transmission and liked it, but the CVT makes the engine nearly silent in city driving and makes the process of going up hills much more pleasant. My gas mileage averages 28 in 50% heavy city traffic and hilly terrain. Our other car, a VW Golf auto, gets 22 mpg on the same routes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable seats; high stance provides a secure feel on the SUV-populated road; quiet and smooth ride; easiest car to parallel-park I have ever owned; good sounding and easy to use stereo; spacious back seat; large side mirrors contribute to good visibility; CVT feel; high ground clearance.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only had my Versa for a week. 774 miles on it so far. I needed economy and comfort for my commute to work and traded in my NIssan Quest minivan that I bought new in 1996. It had 193,000 miles on it. I hope I can get as many miles on the Versa. I drove in the hills and hollows of Indiana last week and the power for getting up the steep hills was phenomenal. I have had other 4 cylinder vehicles that didn't perform on those same hills nearly as well. I was hoping to get better mileage than 25 but perhaps on my next tank I will do better. I need to slow down to 65 mph instead of driving 80 which is very easy to do in this car without even realizing it. I think I'm driving a racecar.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2007 Versa in April and on Memorial Day my kids and I were in a serious car accident with this car. The impact was so serious that it caused this brand new car to be deemed a total loss by the insurance company. Essentially, my kids and I walked away from the accident with nothing more than scrapes, bruises, an airbag burn here and there and a rotator cuff injury. As soon as I settle with the insurance company I am going out to buy yet another 2007 Versa because this car has proven its safety-worthiness to me and my family. Kudos to the engineers at Nissan for designing such a "green", affordable and SAFE automobile!</TEXT>

<TEXT>First time new car buyer, very comfortable interior, lots of space, cubby holes for everything (I'm bound to lose something!). It's a peppy little thing, fun to drive, smooth ride, but the electronic power steering is something to get used to. Engine gets whiny at higher RPMs and highway speeds, but it is not built for power. Haven't had any problems yet (knock on wood) after two months.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT to brag about. Large backseat. Taller vehicle than other econo-boxes so I feel like I can hold my own against the SUVs out there (sure didn't feel that way with the '91 Escort). Great fuel economy at about 29 MPG city when 2008 EPA says 26. Have you seen how far open the doors go?!?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just hit 1000 miles. I went from an automatic Toyota Echo to the 6 speed Versa SL. The stick is easy to get used to and is so much fun to drive. The interior space is incredible and I love that I finally have a sunroof! MPG could be a bit better but highway miles are seeming to be about 35+ mpg (and it is getting better as I put more miles on). Also, the engine is not loud. I decided to get every option available. If you're looking for a small car with loads of extras for less, I would definitely say the Versa is the way to go. </TEXT>

<TEXT>With 1000 miles under my new Nissan Versa SL I have to say I am very happy with the car. Rides like a big car. SL includes 6 CD changer and aux input for iPod or MP3, a must have. Plenty of room for my wife and 3 of the kids, along with a trunk full of groceries. Rides smooth and quiet, can hardly hear the engine run. So far I am averaging 30 mpg with 70/30 highway/city driving. Seems to be improving with each tank full, but I am a little disappointed it's not better. New 08 mpg estimates list the Versa at 26/33 for the CVT. Lower then the sticker 30/36. Guess I will have to slow down to 55 on the highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car really has delivered so far in the few months we have had it. Smooth and quiet on the road with good pickup acceleration. The six cd player is great and the ride is smooth and quite quiet on the highway. ABS and side airbags are great safety features. I am constantly comparing this vehicle with a 2001 Toyota Corolla which I have owned since purchased new. Pros over the Corolla so far: 1. Higher seat (it's adjustable) 2. More room, particularly foot room in the back seat. Negatives: 1. Ride seems a bit harsher on rough roads (but fine on the highway) 2. Doesn't seem to hold the road quite as well on exit ramps (profile of car is higher, probably reason why). </TEXT>

Fully loaded with an excellent sound system, sunroof, bluetooth, fog lights and a very comfortable ride on long trips.

<TEXT>I needed a car to commute to and from work. I decided on the Versa after carefully considering Sentra and Frontier. I drove each vehicle for a couple days and the choice was obvious after driving Versa. All the options and room of the more expensive Sentra, and nearly twice the gas mileage of Frontier. I'm getting 33 mpg and I'll be the first to admit I have a very heavy foot. Interior room is unbelievable. I'm 6'1" 300 lbs and there's plenty of room to spare in the front and rear.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>VERY roomy comfortable interior. Lots of features normally found on much more expensive vehicles, like having the exact same suspension components as 350Z.

The Versa has a lot of head room and driver and passengers sit up fairly high. There is a lot of room in this little car. And I love the way it looks. It drives nicely and has a lot of pep, too. I haven't had it long enough to check if the mileage is as advertised, but I'm sure it'll be better than the van. </TEXT>

I expect Versa to last longer than my Sentra. It's roomy in the front and back. No comment about mileage because I have only used up 1/4 tank. If I get 30 MPG combined, then I'll be very delighted. It beats other smaller cars in standard amenities. Side curtain bags are $700 option in Scion tC. It's not the best looking design but it serves the purpose of good mileage and safety features.

<TEXT>This is a great car. Stylish enough so you won't be embarrassed to admit you drive one, but also practical, good on gas (I've noticed a few complaints about the MPG here but I can attest it's really good if your own driving habits are efficient) and reasonably priced! The cargo area is deceptively large and therefore perfect for roadtripping, and it's fuel efficient enough for both roadtrips and commuting (and it's comfortable too, which is good in those instances where you're sitting in dead-stopped traffic in it!). A 6'2" friend of mine called the backseat "roomy."</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Versa is the first car I have owned and I must say it's really good. The car is surprisingly spacious for a small car, and looks like a much bigger car, even from the outside. The trunk space is HUGE. I don't see any problems with handling, as the car is REALLY GOOD at turns and has a very nice turning radius, so it's very easy to park as well. The acceleration on it is not amazing, but as soon as you reach speed, the car has no problem. For the money I paid it's a great car. Absolutely worth it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a PT Cruiser due to poor gas mileage. The Versa has similar interior comfort and size, and hopefully great gas mileage as advertised (too early to tell). I find the ride to be smoother and quieter than expected. It's fun to drive, and turns on a dime. I bought the base model for price, so I have lower expectations and don't wish for much more other than an armrest. I drove it on the interstate and felt 6th gear ratio could've been higher for less RPMs (it's obviously geared for around town driving though). So far, I'm very pleased with it. No car achieves the EPA mileage ratings (30- city for the Versa), but I'm hopeful for 28 mpg. That would be 10+ mpg better than the PT.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Mrs. wanted a Murano, this unit is about $20,000 less, case closed. I couldn't believe the interior room and comfort, equal to the Maxima SE I traded for this car. It's way smoother on bumps and the seat is a dream on trips. The hatchback feature is great. Paid $119 for aftermarket console, looks great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration w/ the 4 speed automatic is a major surprise. Stock speakers are crisp. Overall mileage is over 32 mpg. Rear seat comfort and head room! Have owned two Datsuns and this is my third Nissan.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is by far the best of the small cars out there, unless you're an early 20-something boy racer (you need a Fit). Its longish wheelbase and suspension tuning means a GREAT ride around town, including over non-spinal-injuring bumps! It's really remarkable. The Fit gets all the kudos for handling, but the Versa is nimble with an insanely small turning radius. Tossable, but rides like a grown-up car. An interior for grown-ups as well, with fantastic fit-and-finish and a logical, high quality dash.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior space. I bought the car for the ride, gas mileage and handling balance, but the interior space was the final point. BIG inside.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having owned Toyotas for years, I decided to check out the Versa, based on its specs alone. I was shocked! The car rides and handles like a dream, and has more than adequate power. Interior room is great. It won't win any awards for looks, but thats not why I buy a particular car. This car even has side curtain air bags and ABS. For the price, I think this car is unbeatable. I have owned a Nissan before, a pickup, and it was very satisfactory. Overall, I think the Versa is a heck of a deal. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride, handling, airbags and comfort level. Also very quiet - quieter than several larger cars I've ridden in. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I expected much better gas mileage, the best gas mileage I have ever gotten is 28 and that is on highway. It's noisy and bouncy, not a very good ride. I had an Aveo that I enjoyed a lot more and paid $10000 less for. Did I ever goof! This car doesnt have much storage space in the back/trunk and the seat does not fold flat</TEXT>

<TEXT>After test driving the Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris I chose the Nissan Versa because you get much more car for the money. When driving the Versa you get that heavy, bigger car feel. Its drive is both smooth and sturdy. The electronic steering feels precise and accurate and the car just loves to cruise at highway plus speeds. The seats are comforatble and supportive. The only negative is some engine noise during acceleration. Though when idling the engine is steady and practically silent. Six speed manual tranny shifts crisply and smoothly. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my Nissan Versa 2 weeks ago. Fantastic gas mileage, so far, in city, one tank, and I've gotten 210 miles. Very quiet interior when driving, even though consumer report magazines have reported otherwise when driving at speeds over 65. Great speakers for an entry level car. The only drawback for this car is the blind spot that is created due to the wide pillars in the rear of the car, very hard to see drivers in the lane you are changing into.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Although it is not living up to the advertised gas mileage, Versa is fun and comfortable to drive in daily commute as well as long trips. The S trim is no-frill and down-to-earth. For the price I paid, I'd almost think it's a steal if I have not come across some of the build quality issues. After a month of ownership, I have found a rattling plastic panel and a clicking hubcap. I have also had some reservation over the performance. The drivetrain is not responsive enough in certain situations and feels sluggish at times when the A/C is on. Overall, I still believe it is a good buy and only hope that the long term reliability will not be an issue.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just went out last weekend and purchased a new Nissan Versa and I'm absolutely lovin' it!! What a great car and that's coming from a former Toyota Camry owner. I plan to take a few trips down to the Bay Area in about a week or so and visit friends and family and for once gas mileage (as well as the cost of gas) won't be an issue since this little baby laughs each time I drive by a Chevron, Shell or Mobil. Gotta' sit down this weekend and go over the manual... still trying to learn the audio/stereo system which by the way is da' bomb. 6-CD changer, MP3 player, 6 speakers... man, what more could an audiophile ask for in a car! Da-da- ta-ta-ta... I'm lovin' it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fav feature so far is the remote keyless entry and ignition... took a few days after the purchase to train the brain to stop wanting to put the key in the ignition. Funny how some habits are really hard to break.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Comfortable small car that's roomy (back seats have easy entry and more leg room than most larger cars). This car is safe - 4 star rating bumper to bumper. The last tankfull MPG. was 36.2 in city and some highway use (very pleased!). Use slower takeoffs at lights and easy braking. You can't punch it to get great MPG! Don't worry, this car has plenty of power in city and on the highways! And the control and feel is secure even at high speeds. One thing we don't like is on bad roads you feel the bumps! But this is a small car after all. Make sure you test drive it on some bumpy roads! I got the best mpg and ride with the tires at 33 PSI.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is quiet and refined, something not usually found in this class. I love the ride (long wheel base makes the car feel bigger). The hatchback is practical although without the seats folded, the 'trunk' is not very big (big enough for 6 or 7 bags of groceries). Rear seat area is roomy and comfortable for 2 large adults. Best gas mileage is achieved without passengers and cargo: I get 32 mpg on my commute (11 miles each way; half is 'city', half is 'hwy'.) Controls are easy to use although the satellite channel surfing took a bit of getting used to. Excellent sound system. Quiet engine. Fun and peppy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's about time that the market starts giving us cars that we don't need a second mortgage to own. The Versa is stylish and practical. Not a sports car by any stretch, but fun to drive. With over 1.5 million combined miles on our manual shift Nissans since 1979, I'll be very surpsied if any major issues crop up with the Versa. Feels very solid and positive on the road, and I'm getting 31 MPG combined. The leg room, front and back, is very surprising to everyone who has taken a drive with me. You sacrifice a bit of trunk space, but the fold down rear seats let you expand your storage when you need to. If solid, economical transportation is what you're after, the Versa might fit your bill.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the functionality of the hatchback. Gas mileage does not disappoint! Interior space, both front and back is fantastic. I feel a bit more cramped behind the wheel of my 2001 Altima now.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Checked it out at the Motor Trend Intl Auto Show and it's everything everyone is raving about. My friend, (near 6ft. and is a researcher by trade) fits comfortably on the rear seat with extra knee/leg room--even with the front seats all the way back. So I picked one up at the local dealer today to use as an economical commuter (for work) next to my Chrysler 300C and Porsche 911. It shifts smoothly and lightly. I like the idea that no matter what my gas mileage is, it won't be as painful at the pump. The drivers view of the road is more than I can say for most cars I have driven. My family has owned several Datsun and Nissan vehicles were all dependable and mechanically sound. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Really earned the "Consumers Digest Best Buy" title. I'm impressed by the interior minimal noise, comfort, room, quality material and exterior styling (which reminds me of the Murano and Quest). NHTSA Crash test results were very good, 4 stars (frontal), 5 stars (side). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>An excellent car, I love it. For the features, drive, comfort and quality, I felt the Versa is worth more than its price. Before buying the Versa, I test drove both Nissan Versa and Toyota Yaris. Actually, I enjoyed driving both cars.

<TEXT>This is my first car w/ any automatic/keyless feature and I love it! Just crossed the 2000 mile mark and getting 32-34mpg mixed ciy/hwy driving. The crash test results came out right before I bought this car and I feel safer. Visibility seeing out while driving is awesome. The standard audio package sounds great and I've had so many people tell me that they can't believe how much room is inside for a "small" car. Love the exterior-- sleek-almost european/mini-cooper like. Love the fabric/interior-plush. Handling is great and the ride is smooth, but could use a higher quality/performance or slightly larger tire.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Keyless entry, power controls, tons of room, a taller seat for a small car-- easier to get in and out of(from someone w/knee problems and previously drove a 2000 S-10 for the height so I wouldn't have to crouch down)--Love having the extra money I'm not spending on gas</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a friend who bought Nissan Versa (Tiida) 6 months before me. He recommended it. Also, i searched the market here in UAE and found 3 options suit my budget and my taste : 1- Tiida , 2- Honda Fit (Jazz) and 3- Honda Civic (the basic)... I didn't like Toyota Yaris because the engine is only 1.3 - 1.5. and in general I don't trust Toyota. The Versa's engine performance is good, I don't know but sometimes it is very smooth and give the impression that I'm driving a sporty car, however, othertimes it doesn't give that power. From 0 km/h speed upwords, the engine doesn't look very impressive, but above sixty or 70, it gives the feel that it is unbeatable. In general, it has wide space, and I'm happy with it.</TEXT>

The only positive i have seen is it is a Honda and the magic seats. I was disappointed with what honda gave. Whereas in Nissan you can never beat the interior space in any nissan they are spacious. But one important thing i found that it has height adjustment and also the interior was 1000% superior than fit as the material used was used in luxury versions of Nissan. if getting for the same price i would go with nissan as most women have the problem of viewing th road clearly and it is a lot roomier thx</TEXT>

I had wind noise coming from the front side windows. This was fixed by resealing them. A fuel sensor went. I went in for a oil change and had a signal light change. They did not have the light bulb in stock. They had to go to the Dodge dealer...3 hours to do an oil change and change a light bulb. For the average consumer, I think these are minor details.

<TEXT>This car is amazing for several reasons. The gas mileage is great, I average 30 in-town (as advertised). The CVT continues to get smoother with each mile. Compared to other cars in its class it has more horsepower so although this is no power machine, it will get up and go more than others like it. It handles well on the road, has excellent turn radius for curvy roads and city parking. You will notice immediately getting in this car that the head room is amazing which means it feels spacious and you have a great perspective on the road. This car does not look or feel like an economy car, inside or out, but could not be more economic for the price, emissions, gas mileage, and reliability!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT feels great! Interior design is clean and simple but not cheap or tacky looking, especially the black suede seating that is easy to clean, comfortable, and looks sharp.

We were considering the Honda Fit but found it uncomfortable. The Fit's shorter wheelbase, smaller tires and thinner seats made for a jarring ride at times. </TEXT>

And there is NO manual reset. Left front passenger air bag light goes on and off intermittently-can't seem to find a cure so never know if passenger is protected or not. Front end alignment was off-had to bring back to dealer twice to repair. 1st time car was so new-dealer did not have specs for alilgnment. Seems dealer was more interested in volume as opposed to service after sale. But car is fuel miser and rides good for a small car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 97 Hyundai Elantra which was a very dependable car but not exactly luxury! By comparison the Versa is a Cadillac. Point is: your satisfaction depends on what you're used to and how much you expect for $13,000 or so. For the money I think the Versa is a steal compared to what's out there. It's roomy, comfortable, peppy, good gas mileage (average 33mpg), quiet ride, good suspension, cute and it's NEW! I never realized how bad my headlights and windshield wipers were on the old car! I also never had a CD player, so you see I'm not hard to please! I would never spend what most new cars cost, so I'm very happy with my Versa.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I only looked at 2 cars, the Honda Fit and the Versa. However, my local dealership wanted nearly $2K above MSRP for the Fit. I walked out. The Versa is an excellent alternative to the Fit. The exterior is better looking. The engine gets "buzzy" at high revs, which is expected for a car in this class. Being nearly a foot longer, it had much better back seating than the Fit. The car leans more than the Fit when cornering, due to higher center of gravity and more compliant ride. Gas mileage is good but not great. I'm averaging 25 mpg in the city. Maybe it will improve as the engine breaks in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got my Nissan Versa, black of course, and it is the best car i have ever had the pleasure to drive. The quality and performance of the car should have raised the price, but Nissan is selling it for around 14K. The only problem i have with this car is the time it took to get. I waited, but Nissan delivered; however, I am still waiting for my floor mats. Whatever ... this is the most sporty and fuel efficient car i have ever driven</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my versa in July of 06 and I love it! However my check tire pressure light continually comes on, the dealership is fantastic with fixing it but its just lit up for the 3 or 4th time. Also check your tire wells, I had water that had leaked into the well from the back window not being sealed all the way. So check that out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>OK, so I've only had it for a week, but its impressed me more than any other car of its class. I've read reviews that said the ride was poor. What car were they driving? My Versa rides more like a large car - very smooth - in fact its one of it's best features. First tank of fuel averaged 32 mpg - mostly city driving, - expect to do better once its broke in. The CVT transmission is a blast. Incredibly smooth - I really have to watch the speedometer or I find myself speeding.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this vehicle and am happy to own it. The only disappointment is that the reported mpg is not accurate and although the dealership assured me the the standards are not based on real time driving and is inaccurate for all vehicles, I felt the advertising for 30- 36 mpg to be misleading. I have only once gotten 30 mpg in over 6000 miles and that tank wasn't a highway driving trip. I've driven it from Tucson to LA and got no better mileage then around town. It has great space inside and rides comfortably and smoothly. It feels solid when compared to my 96 Toyota Rav. </TEXT>

<TEXT>the cvt transmission is perfect for this engine.it is interesting to watch the tach while going up hills,the cvt is able to follow the power curve of the engine unlike a gear tranny.the seats are made of "memory foam" and become more comfortable as you drive. you feel like you are in a much larger car because of the room inside. the fuel economy is affected by the ac use but still gives 34 mpg.side air curtains & multiple front air bags give some peace of mind.the whole vehicle is a quality build and worth the money.</TEXT>

Traded my Honda Pilot to save money don't miss it much the Versa is a great car I would recommend it to anyone. So far I'm getting 28-29 mpg combined city & HWY, not as good as I expected but it only has 500 miles maybe it will get better mileage once its broken in. The keyless entry and bluetooth are worth the extra money. Great Car and very economical.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I live on Cape Cod, but travel for business... I had a Versa on order, but after a delay we found a loaded Versa out of state. It has the CVT, bluetooth, XM, sunroof etc. My first drive in the car was a 4 1/2 hour trip home... I am very impressed to say the least. Lots of room, very comfortable, stylish, smooth and I got 32 mpg on the way home... in bumper to bumper traffic (and it's not even close to being broken in!) I went from a full sized car to the Versa & I couldn't be more pleased. This is an amazing car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this after looking at the Corolla, Vibe, Fit and Yaris. By far the most room and comparable ADVERTISED MPG's. First 30 miles the tire pressure light came on. Dealer fixed and never came back on. Up to 1500 miles now and only averaging 25.5 MPG overall. Never got more than 27 mpg. We consciously never go over 3000 rpms in an attempt to get better mpg but to no avail. Fuel economy is why we bought a new car and this one does not add up. Everything else is great but without the mpgs I'm very disappointed. I have the CVT and maybe it would be better if the transmission was tightened up some? </TEXT>

Gas mileage is a real disappointment. Rarely get 30 mpg in mixed driving i.e 50% hwy 50% city. No way will this care get 30 mpg with the AC on no matter how you drive it. Performance isn't great, but as expected for a car this size. But, for $14K with front and side airbags, it will do.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really like this car. I drove a similar, but smaller model in Spain and was thrilled to see that Nissan was putting out a subcompact in the USA. I was looking for a car that rode a little higher than the average sedan, but still got good gas mileage, and didn't cost too much. I got all those things in the Versa, and I haven't been disappointed in any of its quirks (e.g. audible shifting noises, loose handling, flimsy velcro attachment for the hatch cover). Plus, I love the upholstery (microfibery), the tire pressure monitoring system, the touch- sensitive hatch lifter, and the interior room with an adorable, easy to park exterior. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Had been looking for a year for a 4 door hatchback to replace a lemon I had been doomed with for 4 years. It was an easy one! Love the spacious interior, CVT, cute body and how it zips around. It is an entry level car, so doesn't have all the luxury that some people might be used to, but I'm a simple gal with simple needs. Bad news: MPG isn't what they claim(yet?) and that was THE major reason I bought the car. Also after 2 weeks, my ignition started acting up and it has been in the shop for over a week now and they can't figure out what is wrong with it. New car, I figure there will be some bugs to work out, so I can be understanding--for a while. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT!! Spacious back seat(fit 6'2" grouchy guy in back seat with no complaints!) Zippy car, fun to drive. Overall a good car assuming that they work the bugs out with as little hassle to the purchaser as possible and being as up front and honest as possible.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The GOOD: Wife was sold on a Scion Xa before I insisted she take a Versa test drive. She bought the first Versa the dealer sold. Impressive power w/6spd, fun to drive & great interior room & materials. The BAD: A/C compressor failed 2nd day. Took factory 1 month to replace. A/C now sounds like a dentist's drill @3000 RPM. TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING SYSTEM {TPM):Has been in Dealer shop for re- set 3 times in 2 months w/no low/high tire pressure detected. Consider an extended warranty if this problem is not addressed under a Nissan re-call. Online correspondence reflects an ongoing TPM problem among Versa owners. Hopefully Nissan will address this ongoing problem. $100 cost per re-set.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I took my 2005 Nissan Sentra 1.8 in for warranty service (rear brake drums needed replaced at 8563 miles! =( ) and walked over to the showroom while waiting for my car to be worked on. I took a test drive of the new Versa, and fell in love! I brought my new Versa home last night, and can't wait to get in it and drive some more! The shifter takes some getting used to as I have only ever driven a standard-H pattern manual before, but it's so much fun! My children have more room in the backseat now, and the seats are very cushy and comfy! I had to go with a lower model - no cruise control like I had in the Sentra - but since I hardly used it anyway, no major loss! Great job Nissan!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car brand new on 5/23/07. After 2 months, I called the dealership & said I was unhappy with the mpg. I paid extra for CVT transmission to get 33/36 mpg. On any given day (even while using synthetic oil), my best is 30 mpg. He said no one twisted my arm to buy the car. (no Wonder Nissan yanked their contract from this dealership.) upholstery is rubbed where the child seat sometimes sits. Carpet where the clutch would be if it was manual, looks like I took a razor to it. Molding on the rear right window is coming off. A/c stopped working just past warranty.

<TEXT>I have owned Nissan Versa for 2 years. Although it has some small disadvantages, its advantages are more than disadvantages. In my experience, my tire pressure light has come on several times even though my car is well maintained, and there is loud engine noise when I gas it to go uphill. However, those incidents have never cut down my pleasure on driving this car. Versa is totally fit for me because it looks young, and it has a lot of advantages.

<TEXT>I was looking for a good gas mileage car to replace my old gas hog, and hadn't even heard about the Versa. After driving a Sentra (which I thought was cramped and slow) the salesman suggested the Versa. I loved this car as soon as I drove it. Others in the class don't even compare in terms of interior room, quiet & smooth ride, and a surprisingly peppy 1.8L engine. I chose the SL line with 6M, but I also drove the CVT, which was very cool. Lots standard features on the SL. The convenience package & audio upgrade package are worth considering. Materials and workmanship are excellent. If you're looking for a great commuter car that's a great ride and fun to drive, the Versa is a great choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Being my first ever new car (I'm 34) I did not know what to expect, overall I have been very pleased, with one caveat. The interior is really quite great. The fabric and materials are very good. The audio (standard package for the SL) is nice, it wont blow you away but it sounds very good. The ride is generally very quiet. The Sound Sensitive Audio is a great feature as is the Bluetooth and keyless entry/ignition. The phone mike needs to be more sensitive to pick up my voice. The keyless ignition and entry took some getting used to but it is well worth the bucks. My big complaint is mileage, sticker says 30/34. After 2500 miles and a dealer check up I get 22/26, sub-par for a car of this size</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Keyless doors and ignition are a dream come true. They make grocery shopping and quickly getting in and out of the car a snap. The Bluetooth makes hands free cell phones effortless and was not hard to set up. The largest difficulty was with my phone not the car.</FAVORITE>

There is a serious blind spot caused by the design and slope of the roofline. One must use extreme caution backing out of parking spaces and/or swithching lanes. 2. I have not been able to achieve better than 25 mpg around town or 31 mpg on the highway. This is a major disappointment. 3. At 1,100 miles the low tire warning light malfunctioned and will not go off. I have waited over a month for a replacement module. Will other parts be difficult for my dealer to obtain?

<TEXT>The car engine is very good. Mileage is not that what they advertise but it is definitely worth buying the car especially if you are not looking for anything which is fancy. Interior is very comfortable and airy and has lots of space. The car design is different than new versions like Fit and 2007 Hatchback of Hyundai but it is different and unique. </TEXT>

<TEXT>2007 Versa 1.8SL is good value for the money. I rated all 9's on survey but reserving final rating until I have driven 3k miles. Compared Civic and the Yaris. We didn't like the base model and the upgrade to SL gave us the power features and the sweet CVT transmission. Felt weird at first driving the new transmission (no winding of the transmission gears) but I like it now. I had my first 126 mile road trip yesterday and it was even better on the highway. Safety features are really nice with all the airbags and antilock breaks. Car lines are good and backseat has plenty of leg room for an adult. The 6 CD stereo sounds excellent with nice button layout. Handling and ride is above average</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering and suspension and smooth and peppy engine. The cockpit feels comfortable. The doors sound solid when they shut. All the safety features were a big bonus.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>with a sleek looking exterior and solid built interior, i am proud to cruise around in this car. It has impressive acceleration and handling that always surprises me when i'm cruising. The interior is comfortable, solid, and very inviting. my first tank of fuel lasted 410 miles which is always a plus, and filling it back up at $2.89 a gallon only cost me around $28. all together i am extremely pleased with my Versa!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went in to just shop for a price of the sentra. I had been looking and pricing the Kia's, Hondas, Toyotas. When I saw the Versa I was amazed how roomy it was inside. I test drove it for about 1/2 hour; High speed hwy and city. It was responsive, quick and fun to drive. It has a high headroom even from the outside. Its very European looking. Its unusually long too. 
It was cheaper than the Sentra and I bought the only one on the lot with no second thoughts. I am sure I'm going to love this car for a long time. So far there doesn't seem to be much written on it yet. But Nissan has a sure fire hit on their hands. Its fun and sporty. Well done Nissan!!!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was very surprised at the quality interior and space this car has to offer. The exterior has beautiful clean lines. I had a 2002 echo w/manual transmission before I bought this car. I definitely noticed the difference in horse power. I think this car has only 14 to 17 more horsepower, but you can feel it. This would definitely be a plus to the yaris's or fit's 108ish horse power. On the down side, my echo got an average of about 37 mpg. This doesn't hit that mark. You're giving up some economy as far as gas is concerned for greater luxury and power over the fit and especially the yaris. </TEXT>

After one drive it was no question which car I wanted!

<TEXT>4 weeks ago , I didn't even know what a versa was. I drove a honda fit and about had a fit. It felt like a clown car. I drove a toyota yaris and it was the noisest car I've ever driven. I accidently sat in a sold versa, closed the door, turned on the stereo, and almost fell asleep in a comfortable seat. The customer couldn't get financed and after I went on a 25 mile demo ride , I bought the car. The cvt tranny is a joy. Quiet, roomy interior,no blind spots,great gas milage ,cold cold air conditioning,blue tooth tech, keyless ignition and a great look. I have never bought a car without researching it for a week and driving it 3 demo times, but this car is different. It says BUY ME NOW !!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Coming from an '02 Ford Explorer, my concept of spacious is a little warped. But my Versa is BIG inside! The rear storage under the hatch is deceiving - it looks small but is very deep. It handles great, and everything seems really solid. Interior design is a little funky, and the comfy front seats (the dealer tells me that they're Maxima seats) leave not so much room for good cup holders or useful console. So what? I'll get used to it. Great door buckets/pockets, even in the back seat. I've driven over 800 miles in a little over a week and have been running the A/C pretty much non-stop. Averaging ~32 MPG on the first 3 fillups.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I mean come on now, what do people expect for a cheap car. I thought when I bought it that it would make a great commute car! Then my wife decided to drive it to Florida to visit her sister instead of her Quest. It is an awsome little car! It drives great, gets good mileage and has plenty of room. But the best part is I could buy 2 for what I was expecting to pay for my "new" car! She has averaged 32+ going down at a steady 80, I would have to believe it might hit 34-35 when it is broken in good (still has less than 1500 miles on it) </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking at a Pontiac Vibe base model for a long time but after driving the Versa the decision was an easy one. The interior is beautifully laid out and doesn't look cheap. My dealer only had one Versa and luckily is was the base (6 spd manual) with the power pkg and floormats. Personally the 6 speed is great for this car. It keeps the revs in the powerband so you have plenty of power to merge on to the highway with a full load. Also the backseats have more room than the Vibe or Matrix. Only real drawback is the seats don't fold down flush, however it keeps stuff from sliding around in the back. This is a great car. I paid $13,352 for mine.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine. 122hp and 127lb. ft or torque with 90% of the power coming in at 2400 RPM. The low end torque really helps you get moving unlike most small engines where you have to wind the heck out of them to get them to go.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought mine preowned with 9500 miles, and have put 10K more miles on it. I looked at the Yaris, Matrix, Fit, Corolla, xD and Mazda 3, and the Versa hit the sweet spot for features and price. The Fit had a cheap-looking interior, the Yaris had that dashboard in the center (yuck!) and the others cost more or got poorer mileage. As others have said, the comfort, leg room, options, gas mileage and overall solidity of the car is awesome. If you're thinking of a Versa, get the SL. The Intellikey, CVT, additional storage and upgrades are absolutely worth it. The ride is so quiet and smooth that I've thought I was going 60 when I was really going 80! Lead feet beware. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats are more comfortable than my couch. 32mpg even with my heavy foot. Tons of storage and musical options. Easy to hear conversation from back seat. Intellikey! (Though it took getting used to NOT putting keys in the ignition. Use the cupholder.) Key alert won't let you lock the keys in the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this car for 2 years. Of those two years, both were riddled with problems. The factory tires needed replacing at 8,000 miles, the brake rotors needed replacing at 14,000 miles, the check engine light came on at 18,000 miles, and the CVT is wayyy over-rated. It's not fun being on a highway at 70mph and not being able to hear people in the same car! The mpg is way worse than predicted by the window sticker, the best I got for city was 25, but highway mileage was ok at about 30. The sticker said 31 city and 34 highway. I wouldn't suggest this car for someone buying new in order to avoid repair costs. This thing is like an iceberg in snow. You go with the road.</TEXT>

My tire pressure light came on TWICE and I've only owned the car for 1 year and half even though my car is well maintained (regularly serviced & 15k done). Really loud engine noise when you gas it to go uphill. Its not as gas efficient as I thought, since I'm only getting about 27-28 mpg even when I first purchased the car.

<TEXT>It is very well made, economical vehicle. However, if you are used to doing your own basic maintenance, like replacing rear stop lights or topping off brake fluid, it is a nightmare. Nissan does not supply an instruction manual on how to replace a tail light, and they are so deeply recessed into the plastic that it is very difficult to get at. Same for brake fluid. Nissan's solution? Bring it in for a very expensive light bulb change. Same for brake fluid. These kind of items should easily be driver replaceable items.

I needed new brakes after only having the car for 6 months, plus there was a re-call with the air bag for the passenger seat. Very roomy in the backseat.

This would be a perfect car for a college student or a commuter of any age. My average mileage is 30 mpg and I am quite pleased with that.

<TEXT>We traded in a 1998 Toyota Corolla to purchase our 2007 Nissan Versa in order to save gas. The sticker on the window indicated that we would be getting 28 city and 35 highway miles. We have now owned this car for almost a year and are barely getting 23 miles to the gallon, a far cry from our old toyota that ran perfect. So not only due we now have a car payment but a car that gets horrible gas mileage. We've tried several times to off load this to purchase a car that gets good gas mileage only to find out that a car we paid $14,000 for less than a year ago is only worth around 9 or 10 thousand dollars. I'm so sad that we no longer own our toyota. Cute car, fun to drive but don't buy it to save.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car because I was persuaded by the dealer that the CVT sedan would get far better fuel economy than my Honda Civic. Having driven this car for almost a year and averaged little more than 21 miles per gallon, I feel cheated by both the dealership, and by Nissan who make the original claim in conjunction with the EPA. With gas prices as they are I cannot afford a vehicle that does not even come close to the advertized MPG, and I would warn anybody against buying a Nissan Versa if it's fuel economy you're after. I am not an aggressive driver and yet this car seems to drink gas like an SUV. I have a complaint in with Nissan and it has still not been resolved after 7 months!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've had our Versa for almost 2 years. Within the first 8 months, we lost a hubcap. No biggie, we replaced it. Three weeks later we lost another one. Nissan said it wasn't covered under the warranty! We've replaced a total of four BROKEN hubcaps (2 on the back passenger side fell off) and now a 5th one is ready to come off! The clips break & they don't go back on, except for the 2 that the center fell out and the ring stayed attached to the tire! Nissan says it's not a design flaw! Whatever!!! I've been driving for 20 years and prior to owning the Versa, I lost ONE hubcap after I had a tire changed & it wasn't put back on properly. But at least it didn't break, it went back on the car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, the Nissan Versa CVT Hatchback is a good little car. It looks little but actually has a whole lot of room inside. My friend is 6'10'' and has no problem riding shotgun because of the immense headroom provided in the design. The car does not get the posted gas mileage driving in the New York City area - which is mostly traffic congested highways and stop and go streets. I clocked every time I had to fill up for 12 months to find that the car on my average gets 25 miles to the gallon. I was surprised that my ex-car, a Nissan Sentra 1997 stick shift, got at least 35 miles to a gallon - way better. I also had glitches with the interior panel that always seemed to pop up and stay up.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The best feature is the roominess of the car. The blue tooth and wireless keys, the aux jack for iPods; and the large glove compartment. It also had pretty good pick up with no one but the driver inside.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first ever never used car. The fuel economy is spot on estimate during the summer months. Under estimate in winter (bear in mind fuel mixtures are different in winter). I do mostly 55mph+ driving, with city errands and cruising on the weekends. First and second gear have good power for its size. I'm always tearing up my tires. A lighter flywheel would make the shifting more responsive. After driving a series of beaters that lacked, power, heat, AC, floorboards and door windows that functioned, this little car is like a dream. Super quiet! I often have people ask me if it's on. Spacious. Handles wind shear well... ever driven a tiny Ford Festiva in the wind? HUGE difference!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My little SL has all I wanted and more. Doesn't get what the original sticker stated for gas mileage, but the gov't cracked down on "truth in mileage" and she fits that to a T. Worst mileage was 27 and that was my fault, driving like a madwoman on a mission. Usually gets around 30mpg, depending on what my load is and how heavy my foot is. Has some annoying squeaks sometimes, like the center console or sunroof, but not always. Type of road? We live in a rural area. Had to re-learn how to handle a small car again, w/o turning into ditches. Great handling! Great CD and changer! Probably great Bluetooth, don't use it. Comfortable! Put my rear in multiple other small cars. She had the best seats!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased the Versa for my wife about 1.5 years ago and it already has 40,000 miles on it. The plan was for a reliable economical car that we could load the miles onto. We are very happy with the Versa. We shopped everything in the "Scion Class" of vehicles but found the Versa to offer the nicest interior, quietest ride and best highway manners of anything in the class. In 40k miles it has needed nothing more than regular oil changes and is showing no signs of wear. I think i will even get 60k miles out of the original tires with proper tire rotation. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>For a small car, we are often amazed at how much cargo we can hold in the back seat. I especially like how the rear doors open wide and the overall squareness of the opening makes it easy to load boxes into the back seat. The rear seat is also very comfortable for two adults </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Everyone complains about the MPG but driving 70 miles RT in Los Angeles traffic I have never averaged less than 30 MPG and that is with traffic. Without traffic I've been getting 35 MPG. I couldn't be happier with its performance. In 16 months I have driven 28000 miles. I have a boat in Long Beach at sea level and a cabin in Big Bear Lake at 7500 feet above sea level. The Versa climbs the multiple 8000 plus foot peaks with ease and the manual transmission is great for going down the mountains. I've had chains on it and almost slid through an intersection on some black ice. That was scary. I've also taken it off road on dirt mountain roads and have had no problems. </TEXT>

When we get out on the highway for a long trip, we always get at least 31-32 mpg and that's driving it 70+ mph. We had one fill-up of almost all city driving during the winter and still got 27 mpg!

<TEXT>Considering 2008 versa 1.8S and 2008 Hyundai elantra SE, purchased 1.8SL from very nice private party for a good deal, however it came with new car smell. It had just front ABS, however brake was good. Roomy back seat. A bit noisy on windy day. The noise also has to do with the type of hard tire for better MPG. Soft tire would reduce tire noise for less MPG. I need to adjust my driving habit to handle small engine for better mileage and durability. Good handling and adequate power (not ample power) on highway for 70-80 mph cruise w/3 adults. Passing trucks on highway was ok. Did not feel dangerous. Not tested for any rain or snow condition yet. Better than Honda Fit.</TEXT>

I've already had to have the fuel pump and O2 sensor replaced at the dealership after the check engine light came on. And the interior starting making rattling noises 2 months after owning the vehicle. The ride is pretty comfortable, but the seats can get pretty uncomfortable after a few hours driving. The biggest problem I have with this car is the horrible fuel mileage I'm getting. I bought this car to save gas mileage, not get the same as my '96 Nissan Maxima or my '05 Toyota Sienna.</TEXT>

I also investigated the Honda Fit, Chevy Cobalt, Saturn Ion and just felt that the Versa represented the best value for the money. I just love that it is an "economy car" that doesn't look economy. The value of the interior space cannot be overstated. I have an infant carseat in the back and my wife can still sit comfortable in front passenger's seat. It isn't the sexiest car on the road, but it does the job well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought it 10 months ago mainly because I liked the extremely roomy interior and it was a great value for the price. Overall I've liked it, it's been good basic transportation with no major faults. It now has over 15k miles on it and still holding up well. Fuel economy has been decent. We get about 400 miles per tank on the highway, 320ish per tank with just in-town driving. Ride and handling are good, road noise noticeable but not terrible. I dont think it's as stylish as a VW Golf/Rabbit or the upcoming '09 Fit, but it's not bad looking either. Beware that the price can go from reasonable to expensive with options. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great handling in the snow. Very comfortable/high quality seat fabric. High end interior. LOTS of cupholders (yet I still find a way to use them all). This car is super roomy - much more room all around than the FJ Cruiser suv it replaced. High safety ratings are impressive. </FAVORITE>

I've also found that the vehicle is underpowered, but then it is a 1.8 L engine so I can accept that. I'm hoping that my choice of a Nissan will turn out that I've purchased a reliable car.

<TEXT>This car has several advantages compared to other small hatchbacks: well equipped for the price, comfort, engine performance. But you have to pay dearly for these perks as the fuel economoy is very disappointing and you will struggle to get better than 28 MPG on the highway and 25 in the city. Also this car is not well built: Nissan has cut a few of the wrong corners. The bumpers are held on with plastic rivets and will come off or dent at the slightest touch (this is ridiculous in what is supposed to be a city car) and worse the windshield washer fluid tank is located underneath the flimsy bumper with practically no protection. Drinving out of snowbank resulted in its complete destruction!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great little car. We looked at the Honda Fit and the Toyota Corolla. We were impressed with the versatility of the Fit and the reliability of the Corolla, but we're very glad we bought this Versa sedan. We're a family of 5: three kids between the ages of 6 and 11. Our Versa has the same rear legroom as our Mercury Sable, no kidding. It just seems so spacious! Much roomier & more comfortable than the Fit or Corolla. Rated safer than those cars too. We regularly get an average of 32 mpg in mixed driving (with 3 kids and their stuff!) -- no complaints there. True, resale value won't be as high as Honda or Toyota, but our Versa was at least $2000 less to buy!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable seating, seems "high" for such a small car -- good visibility. Our kids actually found the S more comfortable than the SL.

<TEXT>Have driven the car for 2 months, nearly 1500 miles. You get a lot of value for your money. Gas mileage has been 31-32 mpg for mostly non-highway commute, very respectable. The car's got enough pep and great brakes with the ABS option. The interior exceeds expectations. It does have some quirks - gets a little loose at highway speeds (probably could improve with better tires), the rear suspension is soft (go slow over speed bumps) and oddities like no temp gauge (instead goofy LEDs) and the glove box light only comes on with the exterior lights. Not the sportiest car but for the price it has exceeded my expectations. If it yields long term reliability then Nissan's got a winner here.</TEXT>

Well I have not done much highway driving yet but I do not get any where near 25 mpg where I live and I live in the country. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I do like the electornic key, windows, </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'd have to say that over all, it's a pretty solid little car. Good interior space for the segment, especially the back seat. I got the 6 speed manual and boy does it require a lot of shifting. I'm in 6th by 45 mph. The fuel mileage hasn't been what I had hoped for at about 29 mpg with a mostly highway commute. Maybe it will get better with the engine completely broken in. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the car to drive back and forth from work. I plan on keeping it until it dies or 300,000 miles - whichever comes first. I like the ride and quality feel which isn't what I expected in a subcompact. I wish the gas mileage was better compared to my last car (my Corolla was getting 38), but I am getting between 32-34 which isn't terribly disappointing. The air conditioner is making a disconcerting grinding noise when I first turn it on. I plan to have it checked by the dealer. Otherwise the quality has been excellent. The engine in the car is not very powerful. I like to call it a sewing machine engine. It is sufficient for my usage though.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car sits much higher than other subcompact cars. The price was my favorite 'feature'.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Drove one as a high car here and was looking for a vehicle to buy. Tried a few vehicles not really considering Tiida but kept comparing others to Tiida. Great in traffic - nice to shoot off from the lights while the V8 boys can't afford to shoot off anymore. Comfortable to drive as plenty of adjustment in seat (including height) and steering wheel. Was only going to be a second car but can't really justify spending twice the price for little more than a badge. Read so so reviews in Oz but good to see owners rate this car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort, interior space, quiet, nippy, fuel economy, easy to drive and park. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car is just outright a fun car. I love the bluetooth capabilities considering the phone is my life. I especially love the CVT. It makes the car less noisy and its a smooth ride for the most part. I have not had the car for long but I am beginning to think the car doesn't really get 36 MPG. I am averaging about 28-31 MPG on the highway. The car tends to be a smooth ride with an occasional drifting. Not sure what that is about. I feel my 1999 Grand Am with over 200,000 still gets better gas mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature by far is the intelligent key. Can't live without it now that I have it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It downshifts between 20-45 mph at which speeds to merge on highways are dangerous. There is a second or 2 delay in shifting gears, seems in neutral with high revs. It accelerates well from 60 to 70 mph and is equally well accelerating from 70 to 80 or 90 mph. Very good steering and handling when driving below 65 mph. Anything above 65 mph, steering becomes bad and sway a little within the driving lane. The car is now at 800 miles. With about 45% highway 55% city and I am easy on throttle and look way ahead for stop driving, I get about 25 mpg, way below the expected 32 mpg. Remotes and keys are quite bulky.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It accelerates well from 60 mph to 90 mph. Small and compact, good seating design.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had the Versa for two weeks and I have enjoyed driving it both in the city and on the highway. It has great pick up entering, and I had no problem keeping up. It has a comfortable ride, and I didn't notice any noise problems while on the highway. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features so far: the adjustable driver's side seat. I needed to be higher in the car. I like the convenience of the controls on the steering wheel, and even though I am still getting used to the Bluetooth, I like that option. Intel key is another favorite. </FAVORITE>
