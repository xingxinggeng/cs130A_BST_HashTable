<TEXT>Bought used in 07 with 18000 miles and now have 46000. Have driven my Mazda 5 thru 2 nasty winters in Wisconsin and the resulting "ruts" in the road & first yr. worried about how it would handle. Ride is stiff over potholes (some are totally unavoidable) and I was used to a 4 wheel drive SUV. Mazda 5 handled pretty well & it just took a bit of learning about the vehicle. The 6 passenger seating in my "mini" mini van is great and last row easy to access. Definitely would buy this one again & will stay with Mazda's (had a 91 Mazda MPV for 7 yrs. & loved that one too). LOVE DRIVING THIS CAR & I TAKE LOTS OF ROAD TRIPS WITH IT!! Other Mazda 5 owners stop to talk as they love their cars too. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6 person seating in a totally awesome vehicle size!! Size & depth of glove box. Cooling & heating fast to respond respond comfortably. MAZDA quality throughout!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It is a good car but....the interior color and fabric is terrible. Hard to clean up since everything sticks to it. No armrest for the passenger? Visors are tiny. Tires (Toyo)are terrible and don't last. Headlights are bad when going up and down hills. (Need driving lights to correct it.) Brakes are pretty good but had to have rotors turned already and warping again. The tilt column still doesn't help with your knees hitting the bottom of the column. Seats get a little uncomfortable on a trip. Tires that came with it are summer tires so check b4 you purchase if you live in a wintery climate.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dash layout is pretty good. I like the radio/cd player. Glovebox is a descent size along with door compartments and center console. Driver components are within easy reach and layed out fairly well. Seats backs that lean back are good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Prev. owned large minivan, but after we were looking for compact SUV or 4 door sedan. What sold me on the Mazda 5 was the design. I loved the fact that it's so roomy, has 3rd seat, has storage in the second row seats and it's sporty, not to mention the cargo capacity and the double rear sliding doors are fantastic getting my 2 year old in and out of his carseat. I'm happy with the performance of the vehicle and gas mileage is great, but things that have disappointed me: No Vents in 2nd or 3rd row. Takes a WHILE for the back of the car to cool off/warm up. Way too noisy,Not a quiet ride: Noise is off the chain due to the sport tires I assume. Not happy with that. Overall though, pleased.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am in sales and drive about 35K/year,so I can quickly know if a vehicle is going to last and this has been the BEST VEHICLE I have ever owned. After 76K miles this car has been extremely reliable with no repairs other than scheduled maintenance. Also no rattles or odd noises, its a very well built solid car. The domestic car companies should take note! I'm averaging about 29-30 MPG mixed driving using a K&N airfilter and synthetic oil (Amsoil). Even though it doesn't have all the bells and whistles and the interior is rather spartan/cheap feeling, it is very functional. I am very confident that I will see 150K ++ from this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I found that the Mazda 5 has it's advantages as well as disadvantages. The interior and seats are very comfortable. We went from a mini van and I do miss the leg room on the drives side that the mazda 5 lacks. My husband finds the gas peddle small and close to the brake.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Even though the handling is very good and fun to drive, the road noise is so bad you can hardly talk to other passengers. You cannot talk to people in the rear of the car without screaming. The radio is the worst sounding on any car I've ever owned. If Zoom Zoom is the only thing you care about this is a good pick for this segment, but if creature comforts and having conversation with someone else is of value, look for a different vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like small cars but need space to carry furniture. This mini minivan is the perfect solution! It drives like a car, with no swaying around corners like the Odyssey or Sienna. Super maneuverability; the turning radius is surprisingly tiny. The cool exterior styling means I don't feel like a soccer mom. Very comfortable interior and handy controls on the steering wheel. Manual shift option is great for driving in the mountains. I'm surprised at mileage complaints. I have carefully recorded my mileage the entire 10 months I've had the car and I average 27 mpg mixed use. Driving style matters, though; I drive no more than 5-8 mph over the speed limit and I don't speed away from stoplights.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded in a ford truck who was consuming 16 to the gallon with lesser hp and to cylinders more.Of course no comparison driving this minivan,drives like a mazda3 and the space of a truck! We did a trip around the US so drove 10,000 miles and the only problem occurred was the AC was striking for 30 min. Good we were in Montana and not already in Vegas. Out of the blue it worked again and this was the only problem so far. In the mountains would be nice to have more power, maybe not long Mazda get the new 2.5 fourstroke from ford, better on the mile and with the 5 shift trannie who you can lock more fun and lower RPM at 70 mph. Now 3200rpm still ok but with the new automatic will be better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The captain chairs in the back who can fold down very easy and the slide doors opening easy in small parking spots, low maintenance cost. And good brakes (nice in the mountains without fading). 4 disks instead of drums in the back. Good space around you.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Please look elsewhere for a family van. You will encounter cheap materials, uncomfortable seating and a noisy rear suspension with no fix from Mazda. It does get good gas mileage but besides that it is only good for short trips to the store under 30 minutes or so, otherwise it is not a car you would want to take on a long trip. It does hold a lot of stuff but the noises it makes will think you bought a used Yugo! Stay away from it</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got my car and I love it! It is small but not too small, it fits everyone and everything I want to put in it and it looks and drives great. I am now seeing though how two little things can kind of start to bug you after a while like no arm rests and so few cup holders. I know it sounds silly but because there is no place to put your cell phone when it is plugged in you have to use a cup holder and there are not that many to begin with.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife has had one for about 20 months now. This car has proven much more versatile then a more expensive station wagon. Handling is exceptional for a minivan and above average for a car. Between the balanced weight distribution and the independent suspension, this car can actually corner! Also, it can be bought in a stick! which makes it all the more peppier. We drive the car in winter (including last years record breaking one) and it is not the best winter car. But if you buy winter tires you won't get stuck. Reliability: In 35000 km over 18 months of mixed driving the only repair has been a shock absorber on the left rear wheel. Not bad at all.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My family loves our Mazda5. I bought it for my wife and kid but occasionally drive it myself. My weekend toy is Mazda Miata and this little wagon (Mazda5 is not a minivan!) is the closest thing to it. Considering the size, the handling is amazing and it?s lots of fun on a long winding road. Brakes are excellent and on par to my daily driven 5 series BMW (they also dust as much though). Fuel economy is decent, with 32 mpg going 65 mph on a highway and 22-24 around town. It could?ve been better if Mazda offered more engine choices. However, I can see that this car is not for everyone, especially for people who hate driving. </TEXT>

Over $15000 in damage and I feel perfect 3 days after, my 18 mo old son is unhurt. The car did just what it should - protect my family. I called dealer next day and am going to get my 2008 next week. Any car that is this safe as well as fun to drive, nice looking and roomy - what more could you ask for?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely love my Mazda 5 but there are so many small things about it that drive me crazy seems though its brand new. The style of the car is awesome and it is dependable and a low cost car, the mpg wasn't as great as I thought it would be but its not awful. Overall I love the car but NO armrest, come on! The car drives awful in snow, I can't even leave the house, guess it's not a good vehicle for Ohioans. The brakes squeak very loud when backing up. The back door handles freeze. The tires are new but I slide a lot on wet surfaces. The car has an awful vibration that comes and goes, it also vibrates when the windows are down and it feels like your eardrums just popped</TEXT>

I recently travel overseas and placed 5 big suitcases, 2 carryons and 1 stroller in the car without losing visibility and without folding the 2nd row of seats. Everything in the car is in the right place. Sporty engine and handling and loaded with options for the money. I definitely recommend this car for a young and growing family. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Very fun to drive on long, windy roads. Very easy to get kids in and out of. Good fuel economy. Poor quality radio, almost no bass. Also, when you eject a CD, you have to hit insert to get another one in. On my Ford Focus, it prompts you insert another - one less button to push when you are driving. After we got it, we had problems with the rear sliding doors. Wator vapor got into the locks and froze, making it impossible to shut them, they would hit the latch and bounce back. Mazda replaced under warranty. Brakes sounds like a freight train when you back out of the driveway in the morning - very loud and annoying!! I do not think I would purchase a Mazda again. Just not too impressed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I swore I'd never drive a minivan but here I am doing so and actually enjoying it. It is versatile and very easy for the kids to get into and out of by themselves. It gets good gas mileage even in the cold winter months. I have never gotten below 22 mpg on a tank of gas. I love the fact that it is getting more popular and that when I first got it, people were asking me what it was. I love all the spaces to hide things in. I've been accused of having everything but a toilet and sink in it but you won't see any of it. If you live in a really snowy/icy climate you will want to get snow tires. Stock tires perform as expected on the snow but are next to useless on ice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Mazda5 is a great care for the money! It handles the road really well and has a great turning radius so it is easy to fit into smaller parking spaces!! It also gets great gas mileage. The only problem we had, and thought we might, is the low profile tires. They don't absorb much shock so if you happen to hit a big pothole, it will probably bend your wheel. (this happened to us) Also one of the tires is wearing from the inside out. We will replace the wheel and get better tires. Hopefully this will not be a repetitive problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After tons of research, with all my basic needs and wants listed, I narrowed my choices to about 15. Then the hard work of getting in them and checking them out. At my age, um, senior granny, it wasn't fun and games getting in and out of all those vehicles! My highest priorities were: ease of entry, comfort, mileage and a flat cargo space to use when I go camping which could double for sleeping space if necessary. Once I saw the Mazda5 I was hooked in every way plus it looks great, feels wonderful, and is so roomy for my needs. How perfect for me. I'm one happy camper! I purchased aftermarket leather for just the two front seats which serves my purposes very well!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the tiny turning circle. Also love the flat surface near the gear shift where I can attach my GPS. Mileage is much better than my previous car. The low hatchback threshold makes it easy for me to load up. Sliding doors on both sides! Wonderful!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Boy, was I hooked once behind the wheel and test-drove it. Unlike others who say it's noisy and underpowered, I find it quiet on the freeway at 65 mph. Power is also adequate, get to 90+mph pretty easy. Boy, it has incredible handling ability, tight and sharp turns, takes any turns. Excellent braking ability and comes standard with side curtain airbags for all passengers. Boy, a lot of storage and storage for 2 laptops under the 2nd row seats! I am loving it! Turning circle is also small, parking lots parking is extremely easy. Fit my 26" road bicycle too!!!</TEXT>

I traded my 98 Suburban for this thing in a heartbeat! Drove my first 180 miles and barely at half tank, that?s only 7 gallons! There are few oversights by Mazda. The biggest one being the lack of front passenger armrest. What? Did someone spill coffee on that part of the blueprint at Mazda design team meeting? But overall, it is AWESOME!!! </TEXT>

The combination of a 5-speed manual, small size, cavernous interior, and incredible driving character make it an all-around perfect car.

<TEXT>We read all the great reviews regarding the Mazda5, and for the most part they are correct, but we live in Edmonton, Alberta, and we traded in an 03 Explorer for the 5. It was a mistake, but at least we have a vehicle that is less expensive to own and operate. We miss the 4WD, and the SUV is much better during the winter. We feel the Mazda5 is better than minivans we owned prior. The 5's heater is lacking and there is no rear heat, the low profile tires should be changed for winter tires, the car "skwacks" over bumps when it is cold. However in the summer this vehicle is fun, it gets great fuel economy, it's practical, great to drive and easy to park.</TEXT>

It does miss on a couple of things - front seats don't go back far enough, gas mileage really should be better - but considering there really is no other car like it, these are minor quibbles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned my 2006 auto for a little over a year now. I average about 110 miles a day in this car. Gas mileage has ranged from 27 to 33 highway, depending on speed and use of AC. I had the windows tinted. I do notice some rattles now that I have close to 30K. The road noise is excessive as well. Someone else mentioned this too that the black interior is a bear to keep clean, it shows everyting. The heater doesnt seem to pump out consistent air temp and the A/C light goes on when using the auto feature, even if it's cold out. Dont understand that logic.

It's versatile, economic, comfortable, sporty, playful, peppy to safe, dependable, workhorse to elegant night out with everything in between!

<TEXT>Our Subaru station wagon just wasn't cutting it on comfort and size with a large carseat in the back so we were looking for a new car. We didn't feel ready for a minivan, didn't want the low gas mileage of an SUV. I was so thankful when we came across this car that we bought it almost instantly. I love the feel of it and the price is GREAT! All the other vehicles we were looking at were well beyond this range. Lots of room in the back when the seats are folded down, and comfortable 2nd row seating. The 3rd row is a little small, but it would only be for some extra in a pinch anyway. I love that we have that option. I don't understand why other car companies aren't making similar models?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am not sure what to call this vehicle (I try to avoid van as much as possible. God help me, did I buy a van?). Whatever it is, it does many things well. I like the exterior design if the door handles just were not next to each other. Seating for 6, if you need it (small people are best for the third row), or lots of space for stuff if you don't. It's best feature, I believe, is value. Mazda has put in some nice standard features for a vehicle in this price range. Its worst feature is zoom, zoom. The vehicle needs more power from a stand still. Once it gets going, it is fine and even fun to drive. It handles very well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We shopped for a functional 'travel' car - we had an 03 Sonata. We looked at Toyota Matrix, Vibe, CR-V, etc. Then we discovered this 6 bucket seat gem - 6 disk changer, auto air, moonroof for under 20 grand! 27+ on our first road trip. What more could you want!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We love the 6 bucket seats with the back four folding perfectly flat giving us over 5 feet of storage. There are lots of little pluses. Check out the cavernous "glove box", storage bins under the center seats - it just goes on!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Compact and well-suited for city driving. Pretty peppy on the highway too. Handles well. My wife and infant son like it a lot. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A/C actually does a decent job keeping the car cool. Great pickup and solid gearbox. Haven't hit the hardware store yet, but it looks like I'll have ample room for most purchases.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is the perfect size for my wife and me. We can carry ourselves and our four grandchildren easily. It has a great deal of storage room when we are alone or traveling with two other people. It is a gas to drive and does not feel like you are driving a minivan . Other minivans are way too big for us but the Mazda is perfect. I would suggest anyone looking for a vehicle that has versatility and is also fun to drive check out the 5. I do not think you will be disappointed. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive - loads of room - very attractive to look at.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car!!! It is the perfect thing for moms with two children who occasionally need to transport two more. The car itself is fun to drive, drives like a car but has space like a van. It is the best of both worlds and I feel good that it is not a full size minivan. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The extra space hidden under the middle row seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We looked at everything from the Ford Edge, the Pacifica to the Honda CRV and Toyota Rav4. While each of these models have some cool features the Mazda5 had the basic cool features, PLUS family roominess, fuel economy, sleek looks, and zoom zoom for less money than all the others we looked at. We are so, so pleased with our purchase. Mazda has the quality that provides peace of mind too. The most fun about this vehicle is the fact that we get a fun to drive family car with fuel economy. It only took $31 to fill 'er up from less than 1/4 of a tank so that is nice and we got about 330 miles out of it. LOVE IT!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sleek looks, two sliding doors, nice size "toy"/luggage rack, storage compartments under the middle seats and multiple cup holders too. Easy to use fold down seating. Smaller engine but plenty of zoom and great gas mileage for what it is.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Pretty good, but its huge list of features have to include the following in the next 2 years: a 5 or 6 speed automatic, rear air conditioning, standard tinted windows, an available V6 [maybe from the Mazda6], a panoramic sunroof =D, power sliding doors, Bose speakers, a better screen for the navigation system, a smoother transition between gears, 2nd row outboard armrests, dual zone auto-climate control, power front seats, a "shark fin" antenna instead of the weird one it has now, a bigger center console, and more power outlets. Other than that, it's a great car with a bunch of features packed into a crossover that is a hit worldwide. If only they advertised it more openly... who knows?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Available navigation system, manual-shifting capabilities for the automatic transmission, 3 rows + 6 seats, auto-climate control, outside temp. indicator, bright lights, roomy for a car smaller than a Camry, and a bunch of other stuff!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We recently purchased a Mazda5 GT Standard. As all Mazdas I have previously owned, this one too has the "Zoom Zoom" in it. However, there are 2 issues I find most disturbing: After 3 weeks, our car with a supposedly full alarm system was broken into. It seems the engineers forgot to protect the small back windows and the crook busted the window and grabbed what he / she could. In all the repairs took 3 weeks to complete due to parts on back order and cost a fortune (most paid by my insurance). The car seems less than happy in the Canadian cold and several parts of the suspension have already had to be replaced, despite the car being less than 4 months old.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Compact outer design coupled with roomy interior. Handling. Sporty features on the GT (e.g. sunroof).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We were going to buy a Honda Odyssey, then we test drove the Mazda5. Once we test drove the Mazda5, we never made it back to the Honda dealership. The Mazda5 is a great value for a three row seating car. It looks great (better in person than in the pictures), is compact and is an absolute blast to drive. I've driven it 75 mph with 5 adults and a kid in it and it still zoomed. The leather seats are great and have held up well to the punishment our kids dish out. The fuel economy is okay, but I thought that it would be better (the fuel economy is about the same as a current CR-V which is about the same size).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, external style, size, heated leather seats, acceleration, interior, build quality (made in Japan), timing chain, nice interior ergonomics and design, easy access 3rd row, highway mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this after many months of test driving. Saw this after driving a Mazda 3. Took an auto for a drive, but wanted a 5-speed. I look forward to getting out on the road! This thing zips around. I can't wait to see what kind of real gas mileage I get. It's a versatile little wagon and a commuter all in one. I'll have to get a few after-market add-ons, as the 5-speed is only available in the Sport model. This super mini is functional for my family. I needed a commuter vehicle with room for hauling stuff, and an around-town scooter for the family. A great (different) change from my Saab wagon.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the head room, but I can see where a long-legged person might suffer. Sporty feel. versatility: commuter (gas mileage), passenger mover, cargo space. Stiff ride. The fact I don't see many. Built in Japan (I hope this means very few, if any, German parts).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In a class of its own as an much smaller alternative to a minivan. I love the car-like feeling, great visibility, smooth ride. I have had some quality issues, though. The transmission seems to slip occasionally, the drive wheels spin when starting on wet pavement, the suspension creaks in cold weather. I would buy one again anyway, as there in nothing else on the market that meets my needs like this vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Minivan-style seating for 6 in a teeny, fuel efficient package. Lightweight doors and hatch let my 6 and 8 year old girls get in an out independently. Excellent sound with optional Sirius on standard 4 speaker sound system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traveling in Europe, I was taken with the compact minivan "space wagons." With our second child on the way, my wife and I were ready to give up her Saturn SL2 and get into something w/ easier access to car seats. She was also anxious to get that higher vantage point a minivan or SUV driver seat could offer. So we picked up a 2007 Mazda5 Sport automatic. What went into our decision to purchase the Mazda5 was (in order of importance) the exterior styling, the sliding rear doors (great for tight parking spots), Mazda's superb fit and finish (both interior and exterior), ride (quiet, responsive, comfortable). Price. Small outside, big inside.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Our base model 5 doesn't have tons of features (which is how we wanted it), but we like the dual sliding rear doors (effortlessly open and close), optional third row (effortless set up or hide away, and we can seat up to six comfortably), and the rear lift gate. Sight lines are fantastic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is the ideal small family vehicle. We have two little ones in car seats and moving them into and out of the vehicle is a breeze. We fold the third row seating flat and have a lot of cargo space too. It is so much smaller than a typical minivan that my wife is not intimidated by driving (and parking it). There is not a better vehicle for the small family still using car seats. The sliding doors are great!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sliding doors make it so easy to get kids in and out. The stereo sounds great and the vehicle has great looks for a family car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My mom bought this car under my influence, and she likes it as much as I do. As the title states, nothing is perfect. Some of the flaws/missed things in this car would be the horsepower rating [153 hp], no DRLs, rear air conditioning, traction control/antiskid control, and at least a 5 speed auto to match. However, the rest of the car is nice, with automatic climate control and an available navigation system for under $22K. It has a nice suspension and it's really fun to drive! It's also very flexible, and if your family is small, then you won't need to worry about space. At least consider this car if you're looking for something versatile and small.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The automatic/manual shift feature, under-seat storage space, adequate gas mileage, good braking/handling, nicely built, solid engine with a sporty growl, nicely designed for the conservative.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Mazda5 is a good car for the price. We are family of three + a small dog. This car is the only one practical choice for us as a family car. Good compromise between convenience of a minivan and sporty ride. Mazda5 is a replacement for our Honda Civic EX 4 door 2001. I find interior materials are good enough for the price of this car. I would be happy if it lasts 5-6 years without serious issues. We will see. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is great! We have had ours for 3 months now, and have no regrets. We have the manual transmission and get 27/32 MPG. I am 25 with a wife and 9 month old, and my wife and I both love the car. I love the big horsepower 4 cylinder, great on gas but still plenty of pickup. Very versatile. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking at Toyota RAV4 when I discovered the Mazda 5. This is a much better value and more practica. The RAV4's back seat is barely accessible and has no leg room. Mazda 5 2nd row movable captains chairs are so much better. I love the leather seats. The zippy feel on the road is great too. I have no regrets. My husband is happy too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Climate control, heated leather seats, Sirius satellite radio, available seating for 6. Sporty look and feel. Doesn't seem like a minivan - so much cooler.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Drove it to Disney World with the family the day after we bought it. There were 4 of us with luggage and it easily accommodated all. The drive was 11 hours and it was a good drive. It you are on the interstate around semi's or driving in moderate to high winds this vehicle will tend to wander with you and it requires that you drive it at all times. No relaxing, pay attention! Drives like a sport sedan and is fun. Trade in was a Mazda 6S and we think the 5 is more fun albeit much less get up and go (power).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Small size outside, roomy inside, very maneuverable on the highway as well as in town or in a parking lot. Low price for the features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 6 weeks of ownership, my impressions confirmed what Consumer Reports said about the Mazda 5 w/Auto. The car rides and drives like a sports wagon with plenty of pick-up when carrying 1-2 passengers. Mazda's build quality, amenities, and overall workmanship are outstanding for such a low priced car (around $19k MSRP). The car has all the features of our much more expensive 2004 RX330 except for leather seats and wood grain inserts. After 1020 miles and several fill-ups, our mileage for mixed driving averaged 23.6 MPG, just as predicted by CU. We replaced the overly tall radio antenna with a shorter one for $10. We do miss having an arm rest for the front passenger.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good mileage; easy to use sliding doors; very flexible 2+2+2 seating and cargo room despite its compact exterior dimensions; more fun to drive and easier to maneuver than full sized vans like the Odyssey or Sienna.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have nothing but praise for the Mazda5. I love the way the car hugs corners, moves quick with 5 speed manual, looks sporty not like a minivan,and has good visibility.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>For me the Mazda5 looks sporty inside and out not like a minivan, seats 6, 2nd & 3rd rows bucket seats fold flat, 2 sliding side doors & back door for hauling, sunroof, 6 CD player changer, controls on steering wheel, deep cup holders & storage everywhere. Love the versatility of this vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Handling on this euro-popular van is as good as it gets in a six seater. We got this for the flexibility it offers. We only occasionally haul 5 or 6 around, but we do like the pickup sized rear space for the home center runs. With a little padded plywood, we plan to use the back as a foul-weather shelter when camping. If you drive a manual, skip the auto and you'll enjoy a perkier driving experience.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Highway mileage in the low 30s, city in the mid 20s. Steering, maneuvering as good as the mid sized sport sedan we used to have. Flexible interior.</FAVORITE>
