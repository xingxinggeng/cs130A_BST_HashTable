<TEXT>I must accept that at the beginning I was a little concern about the reliability of this truck due his history but I have to say after almost 3 years to own it that this is the best truck I've ever had.No complaints at all. Just visits to dealership for regular maintenance and for a 5.8 V8 engine 17 miles/gal. is not bad !!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought our Z71 Tahoe as soon as they went on sale. Still very pleased with the looks of the vehicle, but it seems like Chevrolet skimped on the interior quality, lots of hard plastics everywhere and cheap leather. However it has held up pretty well other than a jerking rear end upon take off and squeaky door panels. Current mileage is 61K, lets hope it continues to hold up. Had the Traverse been on sale when I purchased, I probably would have gotten that instead. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rain-sensing wipers, power folding mirrors, power folding second-row seats and power lift-gate. Rugged styling and decent Bose stereo.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought our first Chevy new LTZ Tahoe. Love the looks and ride of the vehicle. Have had problems with the rear end. It actually FELL OUT. Thank goodness it was still under warranty. still have problems with the rear jerking when stopping at a light or stop sign and when taking off. The rear end smells like it is burning after driving it for about 45 minutes. Resale value is about what we still owe on the Chevy. Gonna sell or trade it I think. Keep taking it to shop and they can't find anything else wrong with it since completely rebuilding the rear end. Oh, well. NO MORE CHEVY'S FOR US.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Like everything on the interior. Ours is loaded and it is nice. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The first 36,000 miles of my first big american suv ownership were great. Now that I'm out of the warranty period, I can understand why people who haven't been down this path before get easily burned by some american auto products. However, I've now had the rotors turned at 38,000 miles and the other day I had to replace the entire power steering assembly ($900). I tried reasoning with the service manager that this was way too early to do for such a new car. I can't blame him for the problem, he didn't tell me to buy the car, he's just telling me how to fix it. Very frustrating. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride, interior looks, and exterior looks are fantastic for a vehicle of this size. I've never sat in a more comfortable front seat driving position.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 2007 Tahoe is a joy to drive! It's extremely comfortable for both the driver and passengers. Lots of cargo space and the flexibility of adding the 3rd row seats. It's a big SUV -- not purchased for its fuel economy -- but I still beat the 16mpg rating even with most of my driving in town for less than 8 miles per trip. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded an 03 Z71 4X4 Tahoe for an 07 LT. It took me almost a year to find the exact options and colors that I was looking for. Already replaced the struts on rear hatch and instrument cluster - under warranty or it would have been traded. Local dealer has been wonderful. Interior is not going to hold up. The gas mileage is ridiculously overrated. I drive all hwy with 1 stop sign and easy driving and only average 17 on a good day - finally got 19 on interstate. Was mislead my Chevy reports. Awful resell value. This truck is awesome to look at and nice to drive but I can tell there is no way it will hold up like my last one. Die hard Chevy person, but probably not for long</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like the size of the interior, but ergonomically this vehicle is challenged. Keep hitting the 4 wheel drive knob with my knee getting out. No creature comforts such as change holder, sunglass storage, etc. It holds everything I can pack into it. Had the dead battery issue. Had battery changed at my expense because the dealer said it was good. No more battery issue. I have 70,000 miles and get 17 MPG. The way to do it is coast on every downhill stretch of road, even the short ones. Coast to every red light. Need tires now. Had uneven tire wear but got 70,000 via frequent rotation. So far no mechanical problems. The seals are poor and the ride is loud, as everyone else has said. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM radio, heated seats, remote start, automatic tailgate. Probably systems Chevy outsources. The best feature by far is the small turning radius. That is a big plus. The interior leather is holding up fine. The seats are comfortable. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have to work hard to find faults with this vehicle. Many reviews complain about the mileage but even the EPA has revised the rating system to better reflect reality. The mileage is slightly better than any other vehicle in its class. The interior styling and comfort is vastly improved over previous models (I traded in a 2001 Tahoe). Acceleration is adequate and responsive. The transmission has a moderate shift shock when accelerating after applying the brakes. For those who plan to tow, be aware that the hitch reciever is considerably higher than most vehicles (I had to buy a new hitch with a lower drop. Overall, I am very pleased with the vehicle and would recommend it to anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The factory running boards are dangerous. I have had two people fall while getting out of my vehicle. They seem to become slippery and don't have a good amount of traction to them. This should be reported to GM and corrected. I also don't like the exterior door handles. My driver door handle seems to stick in the out position when closing or opening. I am a tall guy, and when I get in I often hit my knee on the dial that controls the lights on the left side below the steering wheel. This should be better placed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>From the day I got my Tahoe the 1st month it had been in the shop 3 times for the dashboard popping up. The little things such as sometimes the window won't go down, doors won't unlock when I want them to other things like when airconditoning is on it makes a high pitched squeal, but yet it only does it once in a while and the won't fix it because its not happening at the time I bring it in. But the part that really stunk, 6 months after buying it it got stuck in FWD and I put it neutral to get it out but that wasn't working so I got stuck on the side of the road for over an hour till the dealership picked me up. When you buy a new car it should be reliable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle new from the lot. The window moldings kept popping off, a defect which was confirmed by the dealer. The front seat is too small for me, I am 5'10". It is made for "soccer moms". The pedals are too close to the seat, and the steering wheel is not telescopic. Adjustable pedals won't push them back. The plastic on the sideview mirrors was separating, and the battery died, twice. I did not leave any lights on. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Love the Tahoe!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I love this Tahoe. I went from a Toyota Camry to this in April '06. I thought that the Tahoe would be a gas hog but I was wrong. I only use about $60-80 more a month ( due to a lot of city driving but the comfort and safety is worth it). My insurance was only $30 more a year and it rides so much smoother then the Camry. I would not trade it in for anything. I have two kids and they love it! So much room for them and their friends. We just got the LS and it has everything that we need for our family. I could not ask for more for the price. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2007 Tahoe was one of the 1st to be released and I have had multiple problems with DVD, rear view mirror, door molding, power locks, and folding seats. But main issue is with the poor reception of the FM & XM radio. I have had the Tahoe serviced 3 times for the radio and they cannot fix the problem, it may be the poor placement and engineering of the FM & XM antenna in the rear back glass. Radio fades in and out when passing by power lines, trees, building, drive-thru windows. Very irritating, especially when I paid more for the premium Bose system.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We recently purchased the Tahoe LTZ. I must say that we were drawn to the Tahoe by the new styling and estimated fuel economy. The Tahoe is a very comfortable and quite ride and the LTZ has all kinds of bells and whistles. I just hope that after the 3yr warranty is up that all the electronic bells and whistles don't start to malfunction. The fuel economy is a little misleading. Were getting 12- 13mpg around the city and 15-16mpg on the highway. Other than that, we are very pleased with our first Chevy purchase. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort of the ride and handling for such a large vehicle. Navigation system and rear view camera are great.. No excuses now for backing into something. The electronic folding 2nd row bucket seats have already come in handy too. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the first SUV I've owned, but I do have a '01 Silverado truck and use an '05 Yukon company vehicle. I love this Tahoe. It has very comfy seats and rides like a cruiser not a truck. I love the new exterior design and the dash/interior is very appealing. I've had a little bit of trouble getting the inside temp to feel regulated (seem to feel a draft on my left leg while driving) but controls are still very new to me. I wish I had the auto fold side view mirrors, probably only because I'm still taking it to the car wash a lot! Not many vehicles I've ever been extremely excited about but, so far, so good on this one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Loaded LTZ for MSRP of $53k for $46k What a steal for all of the options you get in this SUV! Interior is beautiful now that they added the wood look to the middle console, supurb stereo, comfortable large seats, gadgets galore, and everything you could want in a SUV especially for this price. 35 radio presets XM , AM/FM and you can scan on steering wheel without changing bands. I love that feature. Great navigation display</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior comfort, and location of just about everything. Bermuda blue is stunning. I love the rubber feel to the knobs. Pedal adjustment and leg room is great.

<TEXT>My overall review of the car is favorable. However, the design of the dashboard is flawed. The instrument panel lighting is horrible. During daytime there is no light to view the instrument panel. You cannot read the panel easily. Also, I would think for the cost the remote access control would be a "learning" remote that remembers each respective seat setting. It goes back to neutral each time, so if you don't press your pre-set seating requirements each time, mirrors and seat have to be readjusted. Navigation system is not passenger-use friendly. You can't use it while moving, a feature that would be nice. I understand why the driver shouldn't use it while driving but what about the co-pilot?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great handling, quiet interior. Navigation is a plus. The third row seat is pointless since it gives you almost zero storage behind them. Fuel economy is fair at 16mpg avg after 10,000 miles .Drives great on a long trip and feels just as at home on the beach. LTZ pkg is the way to go. Just do some homework before you buy! You can search local GM dealers inventory online and then request a price via internet. Right off the bat you'll save 10% off MSRP.This car is not your old Suburban. It's been completely redone!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 32+ years of driving, this is the first new vehicle my wife or I have purchased. Our previous 1985 Chevy Suburban (7.4L) with over 316,000 miles, is getting tired, but still going. However, the opportunity fell in out lap for a great deal on an '07 Tahoe and one test drive is all it took to make our first ever new purchase. Although my strong ties to the Chevy brand, which I have been driving since 16 (OK, 15, but don't tell anyone), I think finding a better value is not possible. Comparing to other SUV's in it's class, there is no competition. Sure, one could pay a zillion dollars for a Mercedes SUV, but for the average Joe, or even the upper crust, the new '07 is hard to beat!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent engine. Smooth with lots of power on tap. Transmission shifts are perfect. Watching the V8/V4 fuel mileage monitor, one cannot feel the transition from V8 to V4 -- it is seamless. Dash and controls well layed out and positive feeling. Incredible Bose speaker system, very comfortable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Tahoe, especially now that we have added 22" rims and Billet Grille/Bowtie! We tinted the front windows and customized our plates, and it's wicked! The only thing I regret is not getting leather. We live in the Valley in CA and black leather would be too hot, but the new fabric interior is awful! Everything sticks to it. We have tried fabric softener sheets and sprays. We constantly get it cleaned, and are still using a lint roller to clean the fuzz that sticks to it. Only complaint.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our third Chevy Tahoe and this is by far the best! The new cylinder deactivation (V8 to V4 on hwy) gets great mileage, 20.5 on hwy. Better than the 18 our Honday Odyssey minivan gets! Just in for the first service at 5,500 miles and everything is perfect. Excellent vehicle! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Beautiful interior finish and amazing ride and handling. But with gas prices where they are today, the best feature has to be the fuel economy. No other vehicle can carry as much, as comfortably and safely, and get this kind of mileage. Now we just need E85 in the Northeast!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We traded in an '04 Tahoe, So far the gas mileage seems to be about 3 miles per gal better hwy/city combined. Have not taken it on a long trip, yet the engine switchs from 4 - 8 cylinders with no effort. The ride is like a car, handling and parking very easy to manuver. The radio with the fav pages makes it easy to switch to your favorite stations. Absolutely love the new Tahoe! GM did a great job!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We picked up our Tahoe just prior to a trip with the kids to the beach. We were able to put its practicality to use right away. The new styling is very fresh and we received a lot of looks as we were driving. The 4 cyl/8 cyl technology helped us get 19 miles per gallon even though much of our traveling was through the WV and VA mountains. We opted for the second row buckets and the rear entertainment system. The kids love it. Interior is very roomy with nice conveniences. Ride is great too. We have since had the opportunity to tow a boat and the Tahoe pulls very well. Only knock thus far is a pesky vibration where the headliner and interior trim meet the driver door.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned my first Tahoe (07 LT) and the whole family loves it. I got the captain's chairs for the second row so kids can climb in and out (to the third row seat as well) real easy. The entertainment DVD system is a big hit with the kids - they don't want to get out of the car. The drive is especially nice and is one of the nicest SUV's I looked at. You get your bang for your buck with this car. Mileage is still breaking in and is running low (but I hear that is typical with any new car). I am going to try and run under 3500 rpm as a previous reader indicated. Only downfall is child safety windows for second row seat. They only go 1/2 way down. Once you drive it - you'll buy it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an excellent vehicle. I use it to tow a boat and it does so with ease! it even tows in 4-cylinder mode! My fuel economy is great, I get 24-25 highway and 17 city. (the trick is not to accelerate quickly and try to keep under 3500 rpm) Interior fit and finish is a huge step for GM, though nothing compared to BMW, but still is an interior worth buying. The exterior is beautiful and visibility is improved greatly. It doesen't feel as big as it is when driving. Overall, an excellent vehicle. Don't buy any oter SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the 2WD LTZ approx 2 weeks ago. This is the first Tahoe I have ever owned. I frequently trade cars and have had several SUV's. In the past 6yrs I have had a Yukon, Yukon XL, and a Denali. This vehicle is light years ahead of any I have ever owned. It makes the inside of a Denali look like it came out of the 70's. The interior is roomy, seats are very comfortable. Handling is great for such a large vehicle, and the ride is very smooth. The fuel management feature of shutting down half the engine is an excellent idea. Cant even feel when it happens. I wish I could drive it more, but I can't seem to get my wife out of it. Won't be trading this one anytime soon, it's a keeper.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Mileage rating and drop back to 4 cylinder performance is a joke. My own SUV, which is the LTZ and is fully loaded, had a faulty climate control system and one speaker which didn't work from the start. The windshield has a scratch in the middle of it. The rear hatch had continuous squeaks in it which the dealer corrected. The dash still has a constant squeak in it which I don't know whether or not will ever be found. The polished aluminum wheels and their quality are a joke for the price that GM charges, considering a set of four high end chrome American Racing Rims would cost much less. The spare tire is a different brand than the four driving tires which is another waste of money. </TEXT>

Quiet, smooth w/excellent sound system. Much more for the money than Volvo XC 70 we traded in. However, don't be fooled about gas mileage. Although almost 19 MPG on highway (cruise control at 65 mph through mtn's), appx 13 mpg around town. Can't think just MPG. Must think MPG per passenger.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow! The 2007 Tahoe is one fantastic vehicle! I owned a 2003 that I traded in for the new model. Fit and finish of this one is superb, nicer interior, front end looks way better than the Yukon. Steering and braking is more responsive, interior is the quietest at freeway speed, better fuel economy and flex-fuel capable to boot! Side curtain aribags for all three rows of passengers, stabilitrak with roll-over avoidance, OnStar, and the best brakes in the segment make it one safe vehicle (5 Star frontal crash test rated, anticipated 5 star all around!). Flat towable and low maintanence! A host of options generally found only in European luxury sedans let you own the finest SUV out there today!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The hype about the engine dropping out 4 cylinders to conserve fuel clearly suggests to the buyer that the shift would occur when the car reached highyway crusing speed.

Just installed 22" rims on it yesterday and now I won't see my truck until Tuesday and see what the heck happened to it.

<TEXT>This is my second large SUV, having traded a first-gen Ford Expedition for my Tahoe LT 4x4. Where the Tahoe trumps the Expedition is overall refinement, offering a smoother, more supple ride, better sound isolation, and incrementally better handling. The 1950's Chris-Craft bass exhaust burble is entertaining but never obtrusive, and hints at the burly, but refined nature of what's under the hood. The instrument panel and switchgear appears to be a lift from a late-model Audi, which is just fine by me. Negatives: Too heavy for its size, and a 26-gallon tank is just too small, particularly if you plan to tow with this vehicle. The Expedition had a 30- gallon tank, which was just right. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quick - sufficient power reserve to allow for passing and merging into interstate traffic. Refined driving experience. Sexy 20" optional rims, and an interior far removed from the 1985-era version found in the last-gen Tahoe. Styling more aero/Euro than before. Locking glove compartment door!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the first vehicle both my wife and I have purchased in 10 years. First mistake was purchasing this Chevy. We had leased 7 new vehicles prior to this purchase. This way if we had a problem or just didn't like the vehicle we could turn it in a few years later. I have recently made my second payment on this vehicle and the car is dead. No one at Chevy knows why and no one can give us an answer. They have had this vehicle for 10 days now. The vehicle still will not start. All they can tell us is the engine has no power when turning the key. This is my wife's new vehicle and we have 3 small children.

<TEXT>Great overall SUV. Exterior styling is sharp. Turns a lot of heads and I get a lot of comments. Interior redesign is where this SUV shines. The look and layout is nicer than my Lexus, though the dash materials aren't quite as soft. The handling, power, ride, and just overall driving experience is second to none for an SUV. I like the front end better than the Yukon, otherwise pretty much exactly the same SUV. Also, why pay $20K more for an Escalade when it's also basically the same SUV. I looked at Toyota Sequoia, Ford Expedition & Navigator, Lexus GX, and Toyota 4Runner, and the Nissan Armada when looking. The Tahoe just simply is better in so many ways. Great job GM!</TEXT>

The thing I love the most that I didn't see in any review before I bought it was the super tight turning circle that this behemoth has. I was blown away. This thing turns like a sports coupe. Not sure how they did it but I am super impressed. Also, riding in this thing is like riding on my recliner at home, it's super-comfortable!! I love all the neat techno gadgets in this car and I love being so high up on the road.

<TEXT>The last 6 vehicles we have purchased has been new, and almost all of them have had close to acurate gas mileage claims when purchased, however the 2007 Tahoe that we have is no where close. With an advertised 21mpg, we are experiencing 13.5mpg highway after 4000 miles. Our dealer is side steping every question we have and trying to stall us, telling us we will not see the 20mpg range until the vehicle has 15000+ miles on it. We purchased the Tahoe because we were only getting 12.5mpg in our Hummer H2, and wanted a better gas mileage vehicle. We feel that we have been mislead.</TEXT>

The interior is just as comfortable as every other Chevrolet, but it looks much better. On the highway, the ride is quiet and comfortable. Off road performance is great with the locking back end and autotrac, but be sure to remove the front air-dam before going on extreme outings. If you have a boat, then the G80 differential option is a must. I got $2500 off the sticker price. I am getting 19mpg mixed with the 5.3L- not bad considering the size and towing capacity.

<TEXT>I owned a 1999 Tahoe and traded it in for the 2007. Although the new Tahoe is lightyears ahead of the 99, there are a few things that I would say are not quite as nice. The first thing are the engine gauges. In the 2007 they are alot smaller and harder to see. The gear shifter is very close to the stering wheel and I hit the wheel when I shift it. They radio will not play cassette tapes. However, the air conditioner in the '07 works alot better and you can aim the air where you want it. The Bose sound system sounds very good but doesn't seem to be as loud as the old radio. My truck came with Brigstone tires. I love the DIC. Sounds great when you get on it.

Took it for a 3 hour ride with 4 kids this weekend, going up and down those hill on Mass pike I got 19.4 miles to the gallon. I mean, how can you beat that in an SUV. I love it. I think it handles really great, acceleration, cornering, going fast around sharp bends, and yeah braking.

Plenty of ride height, 22's 24's 26's whatever you want. I would never go back to small cars again. If anything I'll upgrade in 2 years and knock off the new Escalade, cause it's just sick.

On the other hand, I sure havent seen the "22 and more" mpg that the dealer harped on. Maybe someday...but not now for sure.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2007 Tahoe LTZ is a surprise to just about everyone on the planet. GMC actually got a redesign right! I have yet to find a problem or a reason to complain about anything. From experts the only downside they mention are in reference to the third row seats. Some actually say they are heavy or difficult or cumbersome to remove for added cargo space. This is far from correct. You place your hand on the handle and they roll, Yes roll right out. The rear view camera also must be mentioned.( It's perfect!)

<TEXT>I absolutely love this SUV. It is a comfortable as any I test drove. The only real draw back is the fact that the third row seat does not fold back, but that is not a huge problem for me. Other than that, this is an extremely fun SUV to drive, and is great in the city for such a big vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT> After owning 3 Expeditions and a loyal Ford owner finally decided to go GM. I sure wish I had ditched the Fords earlier. This vehicle's build quality is far superior and fit and finish is excellent. The ride is more car like than SUV and handling is much better than the Ford. I am also glad not to have the rattles and shakes that the Ford had after just a few thousand miles. The only complaint is the third row seat does not fold flat, but a small price to pay for a far superior vehicle. Good job Chevrolet! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at the Yukon, H2 and H3 in hopes of finding a nice clean design with a comfortable interior. I landed on the Tahoe and was sold. This is the nicest Chevy I have ever owned, and I have owned 9 since I was in high school. It drives smooth and quietly, and is loaded with every feature a person could possibly want. Love the remote start on those cold mornings, and my ipod attaches with a simple $5 plug from Radio Shack. The leather is similar to what my freinds have in their Mercedes and Lexus vehicles, and the woodgrain follows suit. All around this is a much better deal than any of the other vehicles I considered, and I hope it is as reliable as the 2004 Z71 I traded in to get it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Remote start, XM, integrated phone, 6 disc changer, high quality interior (by GM standards the best), power lift gate, but most of all, it has an incredible turning radius compared to my brothers 2002 Yukon. Easier to park than my Z71 even though it feels bigger.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Tahoe is fun to drive and with the Emerald Blue paint and 20" wheels is a real head turner! Sound system is great and the vehicle is tight with wind noise being minimal. The only problem so far has been a vibration/noise in the dash caused by engine harmonics when accelerating under a load such as hauling a trailer or pulling away from a stop light</TEXT>

<TEXT>We recently traded in our Ford Expedition for our new Tahoe with the LTZ package and never looked back. This truck is miles ahead of the large SUV competition. The ride, performance and interior design is unbelievable. We made 16.3 miles a gallon on our last tank of gas. Not bad for a 5500 lb. truck. You owe it too yourself to take a look at the new Tahoe, it may change your perception of the American auto. </TEXT>

<TEXT> This is a great suv - I did not know about 2007 models until I went to the showroom and saw one. I got all the stuff except the DVD player. The ride is great, the front suspension change makes this feel like a sedan. My wife know has taken control and I no longer can use this car. GM did a great job - we traded in our great 2004 Tahoe - what a diffrence. The only con is the nav/radio/rearview/control system is a major distraction - its hard to drive without looking at it and therefore taking my eyes off the road.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've only had it for a few days now, but love it. Average MPG is @ 15-16 city and @ 21 Highway with no wind (@18 or so with windy conditions) at 65 miles per hour. While the DVD option is nice, we are waiting for a nicer day to take ours in to get the DVD player fixed -- it won't eject the DVD's, and the remote doesn't work. Waiting for a nicer day, so the dash doesn't get cracked when they fix it. Very comfortable and lots of nice features. Love the seat warmers, the auto remote start, lots of room. Not a lot of hidden storage, though; we thought there could be some hidden storage under the back cargo area for misc. items. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is a pure joy to drive. Excellent handling for a vehicle this size. The interior is not just leaps- and-bounds above the outgoing model, but is wonderful compared to its competition. I purchased the LT3 package with the sunroof and I do not regret anything yet (hopefully that will not change). Chevy interiors always had ease of use, but now there is some style as well. The exterior is sharp, crisp and put together with very little seam separation, a definate plus over last years model. Looks are subjective, but I don't think there is a better looking full size SUV on the market today. </TEXT>

<TEXT> I'm sorry I listened to my wife and bought this over the Sequoia (what I wanted). Driving on highway after 38 miles and car died suddenly and for no reason. Towed in and replaced a wiring harness which was improperly installed. Now at 155 miles the gas gauge starts wildly going back and forth. Took it back in. Does look decent on inside (I'll give them that) and is stylish outside. But two trips to the shop in first 155 miles is indicative of faulty build quality. I will not own this vehicle any longer than I have to and will think long and hard before buying another GM product. If I had to spend the money over again, I'd get a Sequoia. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my fourth Tahoe. Purchased the Z71 and liked the body style but wish I would have kept my 2002. Cheap interior finishes, lots of road noise due to cheaper door seals. Just run it thru a car wash and open the rear hatch to see how well the seals work. Also have replaced the shocks on the rear hatch and it still doesn't open all the way. Gas mileage isn't what GM cracked it up to be. Terrible resale value! Are you kidding me it isn't worth 1/2 of purchase price after less than two years. GM could have done much better with design and quality on this one. I'm afraid this may be my last domestic vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle because of the room offered. Gas mileage is a big disappointment (13.4 avg) even driving "normally". I had the battery drain issue when I first purchased, but this was fixed immediately with a software upgrade. Dash area looks a little cheap with the plastic overdose. Great on an 1800 mile trip. Tire rotation is cost prohibitive at the dealer. Cheaper to buy new tires as needed! Agree with the need for fold flat 3rd row seats. These are bulky to remove. Resale price (nowadays) is a nightmare. Would recommend.</TEXT>

Now for the 5th time, it's dead in driveway 30min after I turned it off, guess it'll be battery again. Driver mirror doesn't work, lumbar in seat doesn't move, and seat somehow starts to heat up even though the button is off. Also, contrary to what the dealership tells me, the dash lights will randomly go off at night and start to flicker.

<TEXT>After having a Toyota for 3 years, I decided to give GM a shot with their sharp new Tahoe. With the 20's, leather and DVD ent. system, she's a head turner. It's very quiet and extremely comfortable. The handling is suprisingly responsive. The drawback for me is the reliability and trips to the service department. Inadvertant rattles being common, I've had issues with the tranny, the steering geer as well as a recurring problem with the recirculation AC not working; thus me getting a fresh dose of deisel fumes in morning rush hour. I like the vehicle, but will probably trade it for a foreign truck before the warranty expires. Such a shame!</TEXT>

Have dealt with Chevy and dealer for Lemon Law support--of course, got nothing but arguments. Lots of repairs going on, not much fixed after trips. I stopped counting after I couldn't count the trips to service shop on my two hands. What actually happened with brakes: ended up finding out squeak pad was installed on the wrong side of brake pad. Oops! Engine light that was coming on constantly-- intake manifold was not bolted on correctly---after 8 trips to the dealer, they made this amazing find.

We have had a few glitches tho we had a problem with the battery going bad after a few months. Bought a new one problem solved! Power lift gate off track still not fixed. The real problem is the transmission went out at 105,000. All our miles are highway miles. This should not have happened, it just went out ! We called OnStar for a diagnositics, couldn't find a problem! We knew there was one tho! So any way we got online and there are pages and pages of transmission problems.

<TEXT>I purchased my 1st Tahoe almost a year ago, and I must say that I love my car. I love the way it rides, the comfort is amazing. Anytime that I have to travel I offer to drive, becuase it is fun to ride, and I feel very safe while driving it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The brand new Tahoe is not what I expected. I took my first trip in my Tahoe to Reno where I experienced the throttle sticking whenever I would press all the way down on the gas. I actually had to use my foot to push the pedal back up. Thats not safe at all. The interior cloth seats collects so much Lent. Now I'm looking into replacing with leather which is costly. Another complaint is the plastic lighter covers are so cheap that two of mine have already fell off. I think for how much the Tahoe costs they have should of been built better. The older tahoes look a lot better than the 2007-2008. I take the blame. I should of did my homework before getting locked into a car that I'm not happy with.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the two tone black and beige interior. I have 20 inch tires that ride smooth. Most of all I like my chained patterned grille that came with my Tahoe.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Tahoe LTZ. I bought it used with very little mileage, and it's the best car I ever had. It's a very smooth ride and turns really well. It's great for road trips. The only true downside is gas prices. I'm extremely happy with it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Tahoe, my first being an '01. After 2,000 miles had to have the tires replaced, and since then have had it to the dealership for wheels, suspension, or something along those lines 4 times, and still can't find what is causing the problem. I am very disappointed with this vehicle! My other Tahoe was 6 years old when we sold it and the biggest problem with it was a washer fluid motor. This Tahoe seems to be a cheaper build, with the window seals, interior, etc. Bring back the old craftmanship with the new concepts!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Buy this vehicle if you are into wasting your time, riding in tow trucks with nice drivers, making calls to OnStar, and not sleeping much. I have been towed 3 times in 10 days for 2 different problems. 13k miles, 7 months old. Two times I was more than an hour and a half away from home. Used to love it, now looking at the 2008 Sequoia. I went with Tahoe vs. Land Rover for reliability. Non-stop electrical and mechanical issues. If you buy one, make sure you line up rides from friends and family before it strands you. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I like the way it looks, but would much prefer my '02 Tahoe. My Z-71 has been factory modified to allow the gas cap to open fully! The door and window seals are way cheaper; lots of wind/road noise compared to older models. This is my fourth Tahoe and not as fun to drive. Give me a break on the third row seats that don't fold flat. The rear hatch openers won't fully open even after being replaced. Another design flaw is the hatch will easily get caught on any ice build up on the bumper. I hear everyone compliment the interior build quality but I don't see any improvement in fact I feel it is cheaper. I'm concerned that my new Tahoe won't stand the test of time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th Tahoe & I loved all of them until this one. I liked the look of the car, 2nd row captains chairs, the DVD player. Then after I started driving it I noticed a loud noise from the driver's window, sounds like the window is open. What kind of carpet did they use where you can hardly vacuum dog hair off of it? Last winter my rear hatch would not open automatically in cold temps. Found my battery dead twice, took the car into the dealer, was told there is computer problem with this car. Hopefully that is fixed. My coolant level is always low, but dealer says there is no problem. Had door molding fixed, but it keeps separating. Now my wipers dont properly work. My last Tahoe?</TEXT>

<TEXT>Everyday I become more impressed with the Tahoe. From extreme user friendly dashboard design and fascinating appearance I am more than satisfied I choose the Tahoe. Bose sound system is perfect and certainly will not make you even consider upgrading the sound quality. Power is very impressive for this 5600 lb beast. Gas mileage is 15.3 a tank. I did however get 18.5 on the highway when I went on a road trip. Overall gas mileage is fair at best considering you would assume if 15 is the lowest rating and 21 is the highest you would average in the middle. That is not true at all. She guzzles gas! Ride quality great and handling impressive when Tahoe is equipped with 20" wheels.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear parking assist. Bose audio system. 20" polished wheels are a must! Interior cabin. I never have received so many compliments on a dashboard before.

<TEXT>I had a review posted on 6/15/07. I had the truck for 2 weeks or so at that point with no issues. I've been to the dealer twice since then to have them tighten up stupid and random squeaks, rattles and other noises. I understand that a vehicle will eventually loosen up, but I've had this car for less than 9,000 miles and it's been doing this since about 2,000. I'm very disappointed in the build quality, and I've received several comments from friends to notice the weird noises. It does not speak well for Chevy. Other than that, the vehicle has been very versatile. My wife and I have taken it on several trips, and the mileage has been better than expected (21 on the road, 16 in town).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I use my Tahoe to pull my 5,000 lb. race rig, with a Porsche on it. This vehicle is comfortable, reliable and well thought out for towing and general driving. Whether driving up hill in the mountains of PA on the floor at 4500 RPM, or crusing down the interstates of Florida at 80...this is one great vehicle. This "new version" of the Tahoe/Suburban line is so much better than my 2006 Z-71 Tahoe...and I love it.

The flex fuel is a joke. Hey Chevy this is a SUV let's get off of the catering to the enviormentalist bandwagon. The horsepower and mileage takes a huge dive with flex fuel.</TEXT>

I have had my tahoe in the shop severaltimes in the past year for things that should have not failed. First, the main module in my computer system failed while I was driving, tires went bald at 14,000 miles. The dealership then had my car for almost two weeks trying to repair. I have had severaly issues with the computer system since that first time and it is actually in the shop as I speak for problems with the transmission, computer failure, lock/unlock buttons not working, back door pad not working, and Rear seat dvd system not functioning properly.

<TEXT>The ride is good, but I can't get used to the new seats! I keep sliding out and have to brace myself to keep from being propelled forward when stopping. I find it especially bad in the front passenger seat. The seats are shorter from hip to knee than my '01 Tahoe. I keep adjusting the seat and can't get it to be comfortable. I'm 5'6". I feel somewhat like I'm too high up, esp. in the 2nd row, and might wobble off the seat! Needs more storage cubbies. I really have to bend my foot back from accelerator to brake, and I have the adjustable pedals.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow, what to say. We love our new Tahoe 3LT. It has treated us right and we have never abused it and keep it clean and perfect. It's so comfy and great to drive. I love the new styling. However, we do have problems and its all stupid little things! Okay, here we go! 3rd row needs to fold flat, come on Chevy, everyone else is doing it. We have had problems with the remote start. It starts and then shuts off after 30 sec. The rubber gasket around the sunroof has started to fold and come off for some stupid reason and now rain and snow can come in. The gasket around the rear hatch has folded as well. The trim/molding is starting to come off. Noises from the AC, and blows fast, then slow. It's jacked up these problems keep happening. Our Tahoe has been nothing but cared for. No abuse and barely driven. Shoot, we have only used the sunroof a few times.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If I had reviewed my Tahoe 3 months after buying it, I would have rated all 10's! Drives like a dream, is super comfortable, and looks great (especially new interior). However, constant problems within the last 4 months. All relatively minor, but still annoying. Problems include starting issues, electrical/battery issues, and trim issues/moulding issues. Many of the problems can't be fixed 'cause dealer "can't duplicate the problem." Its my 3rd Tahoe and unfortunately, might be my last. Tired of of my monthly trips to the dealership.</TEXT>

I have had some major problems with it, like the main electrical switch for the door and window operations has been intermittent for some time. My air conditioner blew hot and cold simutaneously. The transmission has some major missed in it going forward and backward. Everyone can hear it, they just don't know what to do with it and how to fix it. It is at the dealer now, they thought it was finished but when we went to pick ip up, it is making the same noises in the shifting gears and they are quite loud.

I knew what I was getting into with the MPG, so I really can't complain about it.

This has all the goodies like power liftgate, wood grain, 3rd row, 20 " wheels, rear entertainment, etc. We found that it was a better deal to go with the LT3 loaded than going for the LTZ. Anyway it rides very well. We previously had a Grand Cherokee Jeep that was loaded and there is no comparison. This truck is the best. Gas mileage is not the best but it is better than we expected.

<TEXT>I really like the new Tahoe. Unfortunately, it does have some problems. The doors all squeak a lot on anything but a really smooth road. Driver window also squeaks when lowered. Three trips to dealer have not fixed anything and driver window now hass alot of wind noise. Gas mileage was initially very poor but got better after engine was broken in and I reprogrammed engine chip.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I have been shopping to trade our Lexus RX300 in for a full size SUV and have fallen in love with the Tahoe. We purchased a 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe LTZ with all the bells and whistles. It has Navigation/Dvd/power lift gate/ and all the extras that comes with the Tahoe LTZ. We are extremely impressed with the vehicle and love it greatly! If you are looking for a full luxury vehicle with amenities, there is no need to purchase a Lexus or other, go with the Tahoe. Chevy has impressed me with the engineering of the interior as well as the smoothness of the ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow....this is my third Chevy SUV and this tops them all. It is a great truck. Comfort and style come together to make 2007 Chevys best yet. The truck rides smooth, handles great, and braking and steering are refined. The interior has most everything in reach for the driver and passengers. Wherever you go there will be positive comments on the '07. By being a driver of past Suburbans and Tahoes I can realize the differences made in the new Tahoe. My opinion is that this SUV will give any other SUV a run for thier money. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Body style, subtle yet noticable. Suspension smooth, braking excellent. Audio system with the Bose awesome. Last feature is body integrity. Paint and trim very smooth. Well put together</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After years of avoiding an SUV thru station wagon ownership, I gave in and got my wife the Tahoe. I'm theortetically getting a fishing boat out of the deal this spring which will make me like it even more. We've clocked ~6,5k miles to date and just returned from a ski trip to Lake Placid. The truck was fabulous on the 5+hr drive to upstate NY on I-87. We averaged 17mph on the highway with 6 people, 1 black lab and all our gear in the roofbox. The village we stayed in still had about 6" of snow on the roads from the 2/14 storm. The Tahoe never faltered in any of the ice or snow. It's a big lumbering vehicle, but surprisingly easy to park and drive in close quarters. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design/quality. All the recent GM products are greatly improved. The Tahoe looks great. Lack of road noise. Very, very quiet ride Handling. Great turning radius for such a big vehicle</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my LTZ already for almost 6 months and it has been at the dealer 4 times. Air bag lights, 4 wheel drive sensors, tire pressure sensors and the latest was the wipers for this week. Truck runs great when it wants too. Gas mileage is very poor. Forget it on E85. Even worse! I actually get better gas mileage on my full size Chevy van with a load on it then my Tahoe. If you have children, flip 4 the model with a bench seat on the 2nd row! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort. Generous room in the truck. Very smooth ride. Great sound system with Bose.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have driven this car since Feb 2006 and I am returning to this site for an update. The car has run flawlessly for 12 months. It is a top notch fun to drive full size SUV. Also, purchased a 2007 X3 BMW and the 2007 Tahoe's interior is superior in terms of comfort and functionality. This is a Chevy to be proud off. Would definitely recommend this vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am amazed at the way this truck handles and the gas mileage. In city rual driving I get 18+ to the gallon. Comfort is excellent and quietness is a welcome relief for a truck. Just got out of a 2005 Tacoma and my legs and back love the Tahoe.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bad interior design. No internal storage, no place for window scraper, fist aide kit or emergency road kit. Hi/Lo beam actuation unsafe push turn signal away from you to actuate, now out of reach from steering wheel. Takes too long to heat up. Gas fill is bad design, back pressure shuts off pump. Gas cap design bad, could come off in accident. Excessive road and wind noise. Not enough driver space. Seat belt difficult to buckle/unbuckle. Beverage holder in bottom of door?Transmission seems to slip. Auto door lock/unlock disable, annoying. Too many icons, use english language, 4 icons representing lighting, could not find airconditiong, confusing. Radio controls too complicated.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Once you learn how to drive it, with a very light foot, and get the 22 mpg most of the time, that feature alone is worth everything. SanFran/Sac on a 1/4 tank. The seats are comfortable, and has every feature imaginable.That said, this truck seems to me designed without any of the engineers ever driving it. First off, the cup holders do not hold a 1.5 liter bottle of water. Lower gauges are unreadable in daylight. They got rid of all the little places to put stuff. Used to have a coin holder in my old one, now a have a baggie of change. For the price there is a lot of road noise. I guess it's light to keep the mileage up. The other person is right about the outside air coming in. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Back up sensors even let you know if some one walks behind the truck in the parking lot. Motorized lift gate, comfort, mute button on steering wheel, mileage, remote start, Lights, looks, programmable entry exit lighting and locking. The passenger seat wieghs the person and turns the air bag on/off.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am in love with this truck. I have a 2007 Range Rover that I drove everyday and I wanted another truck to drive besides my Range. I was going to get the Nissan Armada but when I passed by the Chevrolet place on my way to get the Armada I saw my gray Tahoe and I had to go look at it and drive it. Let's just say I never made it to the Nissan dealer to get the Armada.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my 2007 Tahoe now for 6 months. Just over 20,000 very happy miles on the odometer. The car is super comfortable, very responsive and a pleasure to drive. I wish I could find ethanol in New York but it's just not available yet. Just returned from a 4,000 mile round trip to Florida, great trip. My only complaint is the rear window. It is impossable to keep it clean. A slight rain and you can't see out the window. The car needs a spoiler to re-direct the rain off the window better. The sound system is great as are the heated seats. It was +9 here this morning and the seats were toasty warm. Looking forward to many happy miles. By the way, I replaced a 1996 GMC Yukon that had 146k miles</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable seats. Great visability while driving. Excellent power when you need it. Decent gas mileage for a large, heavy vehicle. Great audio system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm pleased with almost everything about the new Tahoe. The only concerns or objections are the navigation system, the gas mileage and the noise in the head liner. The naviagation system is the worst I've experienced. It will often direct you to turn where there is no road to turn to. Also, the Nav will direct you and tell you that you have arrived at your destination when in fact you are about a quarter mile away. It has even sent me in the wrong direction when I was close to my destination.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased an LT Z71 and I love it. I was torn between the Escalade and the Tahoe and I am glad I went with the Tahoe. I saved $15,000 and got 4 wheel drive. I have always owned small trucks because the bigger ones are tough to park and drive, not the case with the 2007 Tahoe. Rides like a Caddy and handles like a sedan! Great family vehicle. Make sure you shop around. 3 dealers only came down $4000, the 4th came down $6,000. </TEXT>
