<TEXT>We bought this car new as it was unloaded from the truck. My wife loves everything about it and wants to trade it in on a new one since they changed the body style. At first we used to just go for drives to see how high we could get the MPG value on the screen. We have seen high 50s for short drives but average in the upper 20s. It provides everything my wife wanted; She sits up high, it is extremely reliable, it gets great gas mileage, and she likes driving it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>If you get the Backup Sensors you will never want another car without them. The MPG Monitor is fun to watch and makes ownership more enjoyable when you see 30s and 40s on the display. Driving a low speeds in stealth mode - all electric. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am a true car person. I have owned way to many new cars over the years and this is truly the best. The first thing to do for gas mileage is to change the air filter to the K&N. Use Mobil 1 oil and my mileage has ran as high as 41MPG when trying. I get a constant 30MPG when my wife drives and that is great. She just drives and does not worry about mileage. She has never gotten any better than 17MPG with any other car that she has had both large and small cars of many makes and models. Thank you Ford for taking a large step for fuel. The others have a lot of catching up to do. Ford rules</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel mileage, fun to drive, great styling and a good ride. It's a real head turner. You must also remember that this is not a top of the line luxury car. You are trying to get fuel mileage so forget about all the bells and whistles.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I now have over 15,000 miles on our Ford Escape Hybrid (4WD). The average gas mileage is 29.3 MPG which is within the EPA estimate for this SUV. My wife and I love the SUV. I did all the research at the time comparing the Escape with all the other SUV on the market in its class and am more than happy that we purchased the Escape Hybrid. The SUV has been great so far the only exception is I wish the door gaskets would be heavy duty as they can be damaged fairly easily just through normal usage. Both front doors show wear on their door gaskets. The driver's side was replaced several months ago. Other than that it's a great SUV. Actually it's fun to drive. Great SUV. Thanks Ford. Just love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Escape Hybrid is very reliable, fun to drive & well thought out in its design. Recommend a back up alarm (audible) & a camera (visual) this is money well spent, especially on us older folks (senior citizens). This SUV has been a joy to own and drive My wife and I both love to drive it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 2007 Hybrid FWD is rated at 36mpg in the city. Don't believe it! Almost all my driving is in the city. I get only 23-24mpg. Even turning the A/C off adds only 1mpg. The Ford dealer said it needed to be driven for 2,000-3,000 miles to be broken in before the mileage would improve. After 5,000 the mileage is still the same. I know you never get the rated mpg, but 30%+ less is fraud!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned Toyotas for 20 years and love my Prius, but Toyota blew it with the Highlander Hybrid. It's too big and the mileage just isn't good enough. In college I swore I'd never own another American car, but the Escape Hybrid turned me around. It's brilliant. With the 4WD it goes anywhere I want including rough dirt roads and deep snow.... and it gets 50% better mileage than my old 4- runner. I've tried to break it. I took it fast and fully loaded up a steep mountain highway to see if I could run the battery down.... no way. It just works. I get an honest 28-30 MPG average with the 4WD. Avoid the factory Nav system. Buy a Garmin instead.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The price! The sealed battery pack. I can throw scuba gear dripping salt water in the back, and not worry about trashing the battery. Leather seats are nice and have held up well. (The cloth seats looked cheap to me)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Ford Escape hybrid, it looks great, is fun to drive, and gets pretty good gas mileage. I usually get around 28-30 mpg, and I am usually in the 28 range. I wish the gas mileage was a little bit better. The inside is nice and it is a solid car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am getting 35 miles a gallon, yet I am driving a SUV that is comfortable and looks good. It does not get better than that. I am looking to buy a second (used) Escape. No serious complaints, however, it would be nice if you could add the MP3 option to the factory Navigation/radio setup. The 2008 might be quieter, but I like the looks for the 2007 better. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this to replace a '95 Grand Cherokee and an '04 Grand Prix. Mileage has varied from 26mpg freeway to 33mpg city. Power from a stop is a little weak. Passing power is very capable. Ride is a little bouncy. Handling is a little unstable above 70mph. Below that, it's acceptable for an SUV. Cabin is a little noisy, but no worse than the Grand Prix. Headroom/legroom in both front and back are good. I'm 6'2" and even with the moonroof I still have headroom. 4 wheel disc brakes are very good, but have an odd, nonlinear feel to them. Any doubts about it? Ask for a 24- hour test drive. One day of commuting with it sold me on the Ford Escape Hybrid!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>With gas approaching $3.50/gal here in San Diego, it's almost fun to visit the gas station. Hybrid power status screen and 15 minute running mileage graph let you track how your driving habits affect your mileage. Car doesn't heat up the garage. Holds more cargo than my old Grand Cherokee did.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my '02 Eddie Bauer Explorer for '07 Escape hybrid. I doubled my mileage. Love the NAV system and real time gas mileage gauge. Keeps me from being a lead foot. Avg 31 mpg in mixed driving. The key is no rabbit starts and using less brake and more coasting to get to a red light I like exterior of '07, but the interior of the '08. Buttons and gauges are placed better in the '08. Also '08 has better nooks for interior storage. But'exterior styling of the '07 is more to my taste. The '08 exterior seems like a throwback to the late '90s Explorers, especially with its grille. Overall very pleased with my purchase, including the mpg and acceleration. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>NAV system and real time mpg gauge. Love the purr of the electric engine. Every time I hear it I know that I am saving money at the gas pump.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought this Escape Hybrid a couple weeks ago. Not only is it fun to drive, the mileage more than makes up for the slightly higher price. I get about 30 mpg, but mpg probably depends on how you drive. Faster acceleration means less battery use and lower mpg (my wife used it for a couple days and the onboard calculator showed 27.7 mpg). I have the FWD, so if you get 4WD, expect lower mileage. With the $2,600 tax credit, the hybrid only costs a little more than the 18 to 20 mpg regular Escape.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I average 21 mpg with a best of 24.3. I brought the SUV into Ford and they claim it gets 31.3mpg. I had an independent garage test it and it was 21 mpg. I checked it manually, and the on board PC fuel is on the money, 21 mpg. I have the AWD model and no matter what I do or how much I baby it I cannot get better than 24.3. The engine runs if any accessories are on. The engine also kicks in after 25 mph and right away if any upgrade. Overall I like the Escape hybrid, but I feel cheated after paying an extra $12,000 to be green. Figure 20% less mileage off EPA listing and the nav stinks. Maybe Ford should see what Toyota is offering. I own 2 new Fords but don't think I will again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love my new '07 Escape Hybrid. The "Refire" metallica paint virtually glows, catches admiring looks from folks and doesn't show dirt too readily. I do quite a bit of highway and mixed driving. I'm currently getting about 31.8 mpg, which I'm ecstatic about. That's twice the mileage I got from my 2001 V6 Ranger, the Escape replaced. The trucklette is roomy, pretty comfortable and fairly peppy. I see a long relationship with this little SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really enjoy the decision to buy a Hybrid Ford Escape. The overall quality is excellent. The piece of mind knowing that I can have great gas mileage, protecting the environment and also not send money over to the Middle East is worth every penny. I also enjoy the same benefits of a regular SUV concerning cargo space and overall flexibility. The only downside is the interior design, very simple (I can't believe there is not a holder for a cell phone!) Overall, very happy with the purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fun to drive. Handles well. Quick steering response. Adequate acceleration from a stop. Excellent acceleration for passing. Driving a lot of highway miles and still averaging 29. Have seen 33 in city driving. They could have done a better job on front seat creature comforts, i.e. cup holders, change holders and sun glass holder. Safety features were a consideration in buying. Road noise is a little loud but not terrible. Overall a great buy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the Escape for 2 weeks and it's performing as advertised. I got over 30mpg on the first tank of gas, and that will improve. The 15 minute MPG gauge has shown as high as 37mpg. If I were to complain about performance it would be the body roll when cornering, but this is a SUV with a high center of gravity and a little body roll is to be expected. The GPS/radio is disappointing. Small screen, and the CD changer is under the seat. Sound quality is average, and no iPod connection. It does otherwise work properly. If GPS/radio is important to you, might wait to see the 2008 upgrade. It wasn't a deal-breaker for me, but Ford could do better. Improve this and its a 10.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MPG; low pollution, large tax credit, solid feel; lots of storage; acceptable acceleration considering the engine size, and actually quick at start up; kind of fun to change your driving habits and watch the MPG increase, the real-time MPG gauge on the GPS will make you a better driver.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Car gets decent mileage, about 27 to 29 mpg in realistic driving. Could use some repositioning of buttons, e.g., seat warmers not on center console but on side of seat. Beware of the "tax credit" - it deflates on a ratio to income. My $2600 ended up being $159; the economy is still there but caution on the credit sliding scale. Overall, a great car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the Escape Hybrid AWD for two reasons - exhaust emissions and fuel economy. I will assume the emissions are meeting my expectations. The fuel economy? Nowhere near the ratings of 33/29 for city/highway. During this mild Minnesota winter I am only getting around 23 mpg. Granted it?s better than the 16 mpg I got in the winter with my 2003 Chevy Trailblazer LTZ, but the Hybrid is much less of a vehicle than the Trailblazer. I will say that the Escape with its front-wheel drive tracks better in snow than the Trailblazer. For my first hybrid vehicle the Escape is adequate.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation system has come in handy on a couple of occasions, although some of its recommended routes leave a lot to be desired - adding an extra 50 miles to a 100 mile trip.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just purchased a new FEH in Houston. We went with the premium package with the silver exterior. Overall, it looks great inside and out. The ride is comfortable, great at handling the uneven and unpredictable city streets. I wouldn't recommend it for off-road use or for towing. We traded in a 2.8L Audi A4 which was a great drivers car, very difficult to accelerate modestly. The FEH actually encourages the driver to accelerate and brake slowly to keep the gas engine off and reduce fuel consumption. Overall, our initial impression has been positive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Obviously the electric motor and regenerative braking. We both find the interior roomy and comfortable. The rear bench seat folds down easily to provide a great deal of cargo room. Fits the city life almost perfectly.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've been driving this car for over four months now and it has outperformed my expectations. Gas mileage is at 29.6, and I drive all highway miles. It handles like a foreign car, is incredibly smooth, and looks sharp (appearance package). Acceleration leaves something to be desired, but I find myself driving in a safer, more fuel efficient manner when the ability to peel off the line is no longer an option. All in all this car has performed far better than I anticipated. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I received my new 2007 Escape in June as it was one of the first 2007's manufactured. It replaced my 2000 Explorer XLT with 170K miles. My first impressions of the Escape were very good and I'm still happy after 6 months and 14K miles. Gas mileage is steady at 22 mpg, about 7 mpg better than my '00 Explorer. Weak areas are the rear brakes, which are drum rather than disc as my Escape is equipped with a 4 cylinder engine. There is also driveline vibration at times, plus noticeable rattles and general mechanical noise. I would recommend the Escape but ONLY if it has front and rear disc brakes. The rear brake fade is noticeable and dangerous at times. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I truly enjoy driving this vehicle. Used to drive a four door sedan, which had a decent amount of room and with the traction control, it was a great winter vehicle. This hybrid has greatly surpassed my expectations, and I'm only a week into driving it! Comfortable ride on the bumpy/potholed roads in my neighborhood. Weather conditions we experienced with the recent snowstorm and the handling of this vehicle quickly convinced me this was the right purchase. This vehicle feels more in contact with the road and accelerates better than I had anticipated. Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase and what's even better, the wife is fast growing accustomed to riding in it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first hybrid. We have two Fords and two Nissans and a Mazda. The leather is wonderful and it looks great. The side air bags gives you a feel of safety. Wish Ford would have better map lighting up front. My daughter was cold about the truck as she drives a 2006 Nissan Maxima. Took her five minutes to warm up to the two tone paint and leather. Truck is a little top heavy but my wife loves it. Averaging over 40 miles per gallon. Notice that resale value is in the Honda area. Great storage for a small SUV. Taking it up North for winter break to check long term driving. Ford's better idea</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Two tone paint grey and darker grey. Good wheels and leather. Good leather for lower end SUV. Good CD and love the opening back window. Cheap insurance costs.Tires make it look so good. Still a little girly truck but great gas mileage. Neighbors noticed our first hybrid car .</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my Escape Hybrid now for 2 months and I couldn't think of a better vehicle to own. It is a jack of all trades. I can tow my 15 foot fishing boat, haul the kids and, all our gear, all while getting 30 mpg avg. fuel economy. My wife loves the high seating position; she would rather drive the Escape then her Jaguar. She also likes the fact that it handles more like a car then a suv. Build quality is first rate even though some of the materials are second rate (dash plastic is hard). The engine runs smooth, and the hybrid system is almost transparent (better then all the Toyota Prius I have driven), acceleration is strong up to 70mph (it will outrun a 200 hp v6 Escape to 50 mph).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The hybrid drive system is as smooth as it gets, both Honda and Toyota should take notes. The least hybrid like hybrid. The transition from electrical power to gas power is seamless. I also average 30mpg, best tank was 34mpg worst tank 27mpg (towing a boat). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Totally new driving experience. Much smoother than expected. Great sensation of gearless transmission smoothness; like a snowmobile. Power really comes on strong! Easy to quickly pass. Mileage is averaging 31; 34 mpg on flat freeway at 60 to 65 mph. No odd noises...yet. Headlights great in deer country. The graphic displays are educational for power flow study and mileage display reads at 1 second, 1 minute and 15 minute intervals. Driving through public recreation areas on battery power is fun; no stinky exhaust; little noise...actually too quiet. Wife scares me pulling in the driveway when I'm working on the Explorer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good power available with great gas mileage; don't feel insecure. Driving activity electronic display and "analog" speedometer/tachometer instruments easy to read and fun to use.

<TEXT>$3.00 gas got my attention and had me to look at hybrids. Am not a tree hugger-retired & trying to save some green! I drove many hybrid vehicles and all were impressive. The Escape looked and felt more like a typical car. Replaced 2002 Explorer V8 (15/19 MPG). Escape is averaging between 39 and 42 city & 33 miles highway driving from Destin to Cincinnati at 70+ mph. Ride is very comfortable and sufficient head room (6'2"). Acceleration is more than adequate. AC works very well in the normal mode. When waiting at a long light, the ac does not stay cold. Navigation system works well and is not distracting like the Prius. Sound system very good. Great visibility and easy to get in/out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 4.0 liter 2002 4X4 Ford Ranger for this SUV. I had stopped driving my truck because the gas mileage was 14mpg. I only drove it to the mountains and then three people didn't fit comfortably. I can't wait to take this in the snow. I've had this vehicle 4 months and love it. It's so smooth and it's fun trying to keep it on electric. But I miss peeling out like I did in my truck and no more doughnuts in the snow! The power took a little getting used to. It doesn't throw you back in the seat when you step on it, but it gets up and goes so smoothly you don't even notice the acceleration.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the room in the back. I was able to pull into a rest area, fold the seats down in back, and comfortably lie down and sleep. I like the roominess. I love that it's a gas saving SUV! It looks good and I swear by Ford reliability. It's so quiet. Great stock stereo!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As an owner of 4 SUVS and ready to get rid of one I decided to look into getting the Escape Hybrid SUV for its gas mileage. I bought the AWD upgraded 2007 gold Escape with grey leather seats (no option in leather color), rear beeping system, moonroof and navigation. The interior is almost as nice as my 2005 Gold Expedition Limited and the ride is smooth and pickup is fine. It's not as roomy as my Expedition but it's comfortable. I love the gas mileage and am averaging 30 mpg which is double my Expedition. It's a very quiet running vehicle and sometimes at a stop light it's on battery and I don't think it's even on but it is when I press the gas! And it also holds my four golden retrievers!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature is the gas mileage. The car has a fuel efficient link to watch and I see when I am using gasoline and using electric and it monitors my fuel consumption as I drive or sit idle. I average 30 mpg of gas.

<TEXT>After driving 1000 miles to see our son in college in our Jeep Wrangler we found we had averaged 16.94 gallons per mile. When we got home, Israel had just bombed Lebanon - that was it, the oil situation could not be getting better so it was time to go green! We purchased our 2007 Ford Escape in July of 2006 and have loved every minute of it. Yes the tax credit has now allowed us to discontinue our income tax from being withheld from our paychecks for the rest of the year (based on IRS estimates of what we've already paid in) but we love the competition to see who can drive the farthest without the gas kicking in, and we really enjoy saving the environment!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car is generally OK. Gas mileage less than advertised -- no surprise -- but far better than my SUV we traded in. Interior has little storage and few amenities. Air conditioning compressor shuts down when the car is powered by the electric motor only, causing extreme discomfort in Houston summer traffic jams and at stop lights. Can get around it by going to Max AC manually, but then you're on the gas engine, considerably reducing gas mileage. This is not a car for hot, humid climates.</TEXT>

<TEXT>By far the best driving vehicle I have owned. Its CVT transmission is seamless, and unless you are watching the tach, you would never even notice when it switches between gas and electric operation. I don't understand the criticism that a hybrid owner won't save gas money. It was costing us $80 every five days to fill my 23 gallon van to go 300 miles. Now I fill my 15 gallon tank to go 450 miles. By a conservative estimate, I am saving $200 every month in gas.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It drives great like a car and is practical. It gives me a lot of room to work with while not being a gas hog, like my previous SUV's. It is a pleasant surprise out on the open road and is pretty fun.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature on the Escape is the navigation system. It controls are not enormous, while being easily used while driving. I can't leave out the very few trips I have to take to the local gas station also.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Plenty of power for on and off freeways plus passing at highway speeds. Power management system is seamless and CVT transmission is so smooth. Comfortable ride and satisfactorily quiet. The current $2600 federal tax credit makes this vehicle's total cost to own reasonable. Overall this vehicle is fun to drive, and the best hybrid value in the market.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent fuel economy, plenty of power and environmentally friendly.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What I like best about this car is the feeling of total satisfaction I get. I never write reviews but this car has made me want to brag about it. Nothing but tens in all categories for it. Great handling and steering, fantastic sound system, quick response, great braking, great viewability and the backup warning system has proved to be a valuable asset. While the car was a little more expensive than a regular Escape, I'm satisfied that the fuel savings will make up for it in less than 2 years. Oh wait! There is that nice little tax *credit* too! That chops payback to about 14 months. Topping it off, my 12 year old thinks I'm 'kewl' for going green. What is that worth?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 6 CD changer, backup warning system and the lovely GPS angel that made me unlost 2 times already. The good feeling of cruising our small town at 20 mph with not a sound from the electric motor is also a favorite.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I picked up my 2007 hybrid last week and love it. It's a little more noisy that my Mercedes ML320 was but a lot quieter than our Nissan Xterra. I got $500 off the sticker which is rare given the demand for these. The only thing I don't like is the lack of a satellite radio option on the high-end navigation/radio system. Oh well. I think there will be a lot of other SUV hybrids soon so this car is to hold me a few years until something I like comes out. I wasn't going to shell out $60K for the Lexus hybrid.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This is a head-turner, which surprised me. I thought it would fly under the radar but everyone seems to notice it in traffic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Terrific small SUV to drive. I am very surprised of the power (when you need it) with both the batteries and the 4 cylinder gas engine kicking in. It does not take very long at all for the generators to recharge the batteries either. It's not just a small commuter car, there is actually room to take people & luggage to the airport, vacations, etc.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Pulling up to the gas pump! 6 disc CD, moonroof.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drive on the winding roads through the Santa Cruz Mountains and the car responds wonderfully to all the twists and turns. Also, when going "over the hill" which is sea level to 1800 ft summit in 10 minutes the car is not sluggish at all. It also holds its own on the freeways in the Silicon Valley. Best of all, in traffic stalls, my Escape Hybrid burns no gas at all! We just sit there quietly waiting our turn. We are averaging 29.6 mph. Me and my dog, Bart, love this car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car responds to my touch, no over steering. The dash display is really easy to read. I love the GPS!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Escape Hybrid is fun to drive. It is not as comfortable as our Expedition was, but we are paying for technology and better gas mileage rather than top of the line comfort. We miss the storage place in front of the gear shifter and the covered storage between the seats is too small to hold my wife's purse. We also noticed the air conditioning gets warmer when the vehicle switches from gas engine to electric motor, but if you use AC Max it forces the gas engine to run. The car sounds and feels different from our Expeditions, but it is a smooth comfortable ride with plenty of power to zip around town. We bought it loaded and love it! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy to maneuver and comfortable ride. Stereo with 7 speakers sounds great. We especially like the gas mileage display because it graphs your performance during the last 15 minutes. Cool! Heated seats and AWD will be great this winter. The 2007 base price is $1300 less than the 2006!</FAVORITE>
