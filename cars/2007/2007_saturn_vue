<TEXT>We bought a Saturn SL Car new in 2002 and it has been the one of the best vehicles we ever owned. So when it was time for a second vehicle,we thought we would try a VUE.Out the of ten brand new vehicles we have had,it has been the worst! Here are the parts that have been replaced: 3 strut mounts,1 strut,sway bar busings,tailgate rusted..painted 3 times in 18 months! both lower seat cushions..cracked, drivers seat mechanism..still rocks side to side, doors adjusted, weather stripping & cowl..for wind noise, pass side exterior door panel, rear end clutch pack,transmission torque converter..still growls between 1100- 1300. 28 months old..35,000miles! Maintained regularly and not abused. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I thought I had a dud, however it seems I have the same view as everyone else. Labor day weekend 2008 I spent 4hours at the dealership while they replaced sway bar (8 months pregnant with a two year old) never once offered a loaner to get to our cabin. Ive had it in 7 times for the noise and it has never been fixed. Driving on the highway you need earplugs! We have had wheel bearings replaced,breaks every 6 months, and the customer service is terrible. I am a mother of 2, the car is driving responsibly. It is at the dealership now as I pulled out of the parking lot from work yesterday, and it lost complete power and would not take her gas. Every light on the dash was glowing. I'm frustrated!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Saturn Vue after totaling my 2007 Altima (which I LOVED). I wish that I would've gotten something MUCH more stylish. It was decent on gas, but the road noise was too loud for me to even use my bluetooth headset to talk on the phone! I just got rid of it because I don't like the "soccer mom" look, and the resale value was AWFUL! I loved the service but need something MUCH cuter to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall it was a good vehicle, better than my 04 Vue. Quality is average, still a lot of cheap plastic throughout the interior. No major issues. Only a few trips to the dealer for minor repairs. Kids didn't like the back seat, not comfortable and not enough cup holders. mileage is OK but not great. Ending the lease soon and would consider buying the car if the price was right. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My initial experience with the 2007 Saturn VUE has been all positive. The VUE had 40410 miles on it when I got it and continues to satisfy. The interior appointments are classy without being gaudy and the exterior is smooth. The engine is quiet and powerful (3.5l V-6). The stereo is easy to use and the steering mounted controls limit the amount your eyes are away from the road. So far I am very satisfied with my purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>the Saturn VUE is not what it claims to be. I had problems with the stearing wheel and the dealer had to replace the ignation. There is also a leak in the left driver side and the battery is always drained and the dealer could not figure out the reason. In addition to the doors allow air into the vehicle specially in windy days. For the amount I paid, I expected a better quality. Also the dealer claimed that I would receive a $1000 rebate and they would not give it. I thought Saturn dealers are somehow honest, but they are still car dealers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had had a trouble-free Saturn sport coupe and when I needed a bigger vehicle, I bought the Vue. It has been wonderful for my two large dogs. I've had a generally good experience with the dealership, with the exception that they charged me $25 over the quote the last time I had it serviced, however, the oil change was a decent price rather than the $95 that had charged me previously. The plastic seat-mount cracked. I've had no other problems with the vehicle. Before my Saturns, I drove a Jag. Hey, it is not a Jag, but for the money, I can afford to step down a few notches. Plus, the maintenance cost on the Jag was horrendous, and it was in the shop frequently.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the extra utility outlets; the mileage, the trouble-free maintenance so far; the grocery organizer; the low payments; the dependability; the leather seats; the dependable cruise control; the OnStar feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our first SUV. However, it is a "looks can be deceiving" vehicle. W/in the first 6 months, the back seat stitching ripped out, the mirror adjuster popped off, and the middle console cracked. After owning it 2yrs and 6 months, both front wheel bearings went out, the rear main seal began leaking, and something went wrong with the rear axle.On windy days, the driver's side and passenger side doors tend to push out at the top. There is a lot of road noise and air. When the windows or sunroof is open, there is a vaccuum of air that makes your ears pop. Other than that, it handles great in all kinds of weather.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought my 250hp,V6, 2007 Vue (with the Honda engine) in late 2006. I bought it with airbags, upgraded sound system and all the upgrades. Never requires anything but an oil change and it runs perfectly. Great cargo space and very zippy on the road. Best SUV I've owned. Too bad they put a GM engine in the new Vue. The Chevy Traverse is similar to my old 2007 Vue, but with a $30K base price for the Chevy, I'd rather spend a little extra and get the new Mercedes GLK350 SUV for $35K. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So far the car has been perfect for me. I would say the external look is perfect with the Black Onyx paint, chrome package, and internal wood-trim accents. It looks much more pricy than it really was. The car handles rather well. A little odd if you accelerate around corners quickly though. Sometimes it feels as if the wheel gets stickier in your turn direction if you go too fast around a turn. And the engine is extremely peppy with a 3.5L V6. Overall the classy look, gas mileage for an SUV, and Honda engine were the big sellers for me. If you're a big music person, upgrade the speakers the stock ones are very basic.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 2007 look. 2008 models lack this look. iPod jack. Flip-up storage in trunk, heated seats, classy look of radio and knobs, Option of supplemental side curtain air bags, smooth ride, 17" wheels "look", accidental lock out protection, dome light auto off if left on.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I shopped around for an SUV and after considerable research I purchased a 2007 VUE and have not been disappointed in my decision. This is a fun to drive SUV that delivers plenty of power from its Honda 3.5 six cylinder engine and great gas mileage. I would like to see rear disc breaks and a telescoping steering wheel. The controls are easy to use and the rear seating is comfortable. I would recomend anyone looking for a smaller SUV to test drive a VUE</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife's 99 Honda Passport finally died. She really wanted to stay with the smaller SUV. We ended up test driving the Honda Pilot (a little pricey), Rav4 (bumpy short wheelbase not a lot of cargo space). We almost gave up in finding an SUV, friend recommended the VUE. Sales staff were great, the car fit our budget. We added leather, V6, enhanced stereo, alloy 17" wheels, spolier and DVD system. The ride is very smooth, a little more road noise form the 17" wheels. Acceleration is outstanding! Cargo room more than enough for us. We have the Polar White and get many comments on the look of the SUV from others, espically at the car wash.. The car looks like a much higher priced unit!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the V6 and DVD system. Interior is laid out very well as well as controls on the steering wheel for cruise and radio! OnStar is one big plus. The overall look of the vehicle is impressive! A+ Cargo space and grocery carrier an A+!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far, about 3,000 miles of driving. The car meets all of my expectations in terms of size, flexibility, utility, handling and comfort. Gas mileage for 6 cyl AWD on steady highway of 26 mpg; 17-18 in city; overall 22 mpg. Good smooth and strong performance from engine and trans; heated seats are real nice. The sound system is decent and it has an MP3 jack. I really like the storage flip up system in rear. Chrome dresses it up and the fog lights are super. The sun roof works great and closes completely -- no whistle from wind. Since I live in New England, it is the perfect blend of vehicle for all climates.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My VUE Green Line has been a smooth, miserly ride for these couple of months. The hybrid actions took very little to get used to, and the fuel economy has been very good. My last tank full came out to about 30 mpg!, not bad for an SUV of this size.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned a few of GM's vehicles. After talking with other Saturn's owners, all of them said that they would not purchase any other vehicle. So, I decided to purchased the VUE. I just love it. I've got so much for my money. No need to purchase packages, no need to add on anything, unless you want sunroof, leather. I didn't need that. But, everything else came in one package. I even got OnStar. The ride is wonderful. I previously owned a Buick Regal and it was a 6 cylinder and now have a 4 cylinder and I can't tell the difference. I now fill-up every week and 1/2 instead of filling up every week. Trust me on this. This is a good buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a great vehicle. Saturn puts a zoomy 250hp V6 Honda engine in the VUE. The result is a great ride in a sporty vehicle and you can heap on the extras like, leather, a sunroof and super stereo system without killing your wallet. Great for hauling my bike, canoe and dogs. All that and a best in class 28 mpg highway rating. I looked for 8 months and couldn't find that combo in any other mid size SUV. Saturn wins big with the VUE.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our VUE in Oct, and we can't stay out of it. We love the interior and the space you get with this vehicle and the sunroof is just icing on the cake. We chose the storm gray, awsome color. The steering is so smooth it's effortless. We love it. The pick up for a four cylinder was suprisingly quick, and on the first tank full I got 27 miles per gallon. We test drove the Rav 4 and the Honda CR-V. Both were too small inside. We chose the Saturn for the space and fuel economy. This is our first Saturn and only time will tell if it's our last. I heard they last a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My V6 AWD VUE looks nice on the outside, but exterior look is strictly for those that are looking. Chrome package is OK. Forget running boards. They look good but mine actually get in my way. Get mud flaps. The VUE kicks up a lot of dirt and the interior of the doors gets pretty nasty. Get the sunroof air deflector; it eliminates horrendous noise when the sunroof is opened. Rooftop cross rails are pretty, but not sure if they are needed. Some VUE accessories need to be installed by the dealer. Mine tried to whack me with an additional $300.00 over quoted but agreed to eat the cost. Order the extra?s online and install them yourself. 180 watt upgraded stereo is a waste of money. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The view from the VUE is unobstructed. Steering seems odd but acceptable. Seats are small but not uncomfortable once you find the right position.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my VUE for a week and love all the wonderful features and the superb gas mileage. It has a ride like a car (really quiet), good pick up (AWD V6), looks great on the road, and has a comfortable backseat. My only complaint, it has a small gas tank. I drive 100 miles per day, and have to fill up every other day. You can't beat the OnStar with built in phone, that can be connected to your cell service.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently bought this vehicle for my wife. It's just the two of us. It's larger than most "compact" SUVs and has a lot of power (Honda V6). The thing just wants to go. The free year of OnStar is nice, as my wife is famous for locking her keys in the car (once with the car running). The back storage is very versatile (love the grocery organizer). We opted for the tan leather interior, looks really nice with the wood trim. It's still relatively new for us, just a few hundred miles but we've been impressed with it thus far. And the dealer experience has been great, very painless, no pressure. We'll definitely go back to Saturn for future purchases. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got a V6 auto VUE and I love it! I had a small European car, and although it does not have a lot of the neat features of my old car, I still like the VUE. Great gas mileage, fun to drive, roomy, dealership is customer friendly! I was looking for a small afordable SUV as I convert over from a sedan to an SUV and this is perfect. I would recommend it for non-SUV drivers. My husband, who has a huge SUV, says it's just "OK" and not much to it, but for me it's great! Just enough! My good friend has an '06 and has not had one problem. She and her family (dog & kids) all enjoy the car. My dog, likes the space in the back where I can store her water for long trips!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded our Chevy Blazer for a new Vue. The Blazer had more room upfront and all over. The Vue had a nice price for what we could afford in an SUV but please - After 15,000 miles - the road noise was enough to make you lose your mind!! We have so many rattling windows and the wind blowing makes them vibrate. Need to wear your ear plugs and plug in an ipod for playing music real loud so you don't hear all the noises this thing makes. Don't take to a dearlership - they pretend to work on all of it and just say that it is the same noise in a Lexus. What a joke.

<TEXT>I purchased this SUV having 3 large dogs. I keep the back seat folded down 90% of the time, and it fits them perfectly. It has been a great car for us, and I would definitely recommend it. Only disappointment which I have seen noted in numerous places is the rotors have been resurfaced 2 times due to warping(should have been replaced since it was under warranty at only 23,000 miles), but Saturn said they had certain "steps" they have to take in order to actually get you a new set. I recommend actually watching them put them on so you know they didn't "resurface" them!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this car for my wife because of the all wheel drive and she likes the way it looks. I agreed because of the Honda engine and transmission! Interior plastics seem OK, but there is a rattle from the back of the car that seems to be from the grocery organizer that is terribly annoying. There is some wind noise from the windshield above 45MPH, but you get used to it. The interior is quite roomy for how small the exterior looks. I thought the gas mileage would be a little better; we drive mostly 2 lanes and highway and we are struggling to see 20MPG.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hidden compartment under the cupholders is great for less-used items and a cell charger. V6 engine is so smooth! Transmission does not hunt for gears. Lots of useful storage compartments. Good turning radius, but too many turns to lock.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Bad Vue</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Stay away from the Vue. We have had our Vue for about 18 months and it has sent over 2 months in the shop. 2 front wheel bearings, a strut, front linkage, air conditioner have all been replaced. The drivers and passenger doors and tailgate had to be repainted and we paid the the additional money for the paint and fabric protection. We talked to customer service at Saturn and they told us that the noise it is making now is a lumbering noise that is probably sheet metal flexing when you go over bumps. Nothing they can fix. Incredible! Something is wrong in the front end and it is definitely a safety issue and they won't do anything about it. We need help before bearings go out again!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really enjoyed our 2007 Saturn Vue. We had it for a year and half but had to get rid of it and trade it in for a van because we now have two kids. We only had a problem with the engine light coming on. It handles horribly in the rain though, be warn! I was in a rainstorm and I had to drive 45 miles just so I didn't slide all over the road. I've had other SUV's and this one handled the worst out of the 3. I hope they fixed it in the 2008 model!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought brand new in 2007, absolutely worst car I have ever owned. Obvious electrical problems, speakers would work intermittently, dashboard lights flashed off and on. Dealer told me they could find nothing wrong. Shifting not smooth at all. Gas mileage barely 20 in the city, 22 HWY. Manifold leak at 12,000 miles. AC Compressor out at 16,000 miles. This car bears truth to the saying "you get what you pay for". Inexpensive SUV, and shows it. After the compressor went out, I decided I didn't want to see what would happen once the warranty expired at 36,000 miles, and traded it in for a Nissan Xterra. Horrible trade in value. Know 2 other people who own one and not happy either. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Vue for over a year and am still totally in love with it, and I drive a lot! I've taken it on many road trips from Florida to Canada and lots of places in between. I travel from VA to TN quite a bit and love the power that I have climbing through the mountains and it seemingly doesn't sacrifice much on gas mileage to do so. My most recent trip took me from central Va, to Central Tn to August, Ga and then back to VA again. Lots of mountanous terrain and I got about 25 miles to the gallon on the whole trip. There is plenty of space and it's a comfortable ride. Love the back as well and the handy compartments for storing things. Would absolutely buy it again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm more about bells-and-whistles than nuts-and-bolts, but this is a very nice ride. After 17 months, I get 28-29mpg, though I just took a 400-mile trip on far less than a tank of gas (I average 410-430mpt, but this time I got over 450). As expected, mpg drops in the dead of winter and summer, with extra heater/AC use. Inside layout is easy, and takes only a minor getting used to (I no longer try to set the cruise control on the steering wheel and end up changing the radio station). Visibility and cargo capacity are quite good. Comfy seats, OnStar and XM are awesome. A couple of minor computer issues, resolved by dealer. And that engine turnoff at stoplights still freaks out passengers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned this greenline for almost a year. It has had two recalls, both of which were very pleasent waits. Great tow vehicle behind our motorhome. Vue carries two med sized dogs and my wife along with three weeks worth of supplies and clothing to our campsites. Fully load and crusing above CA speed limits we still ave. 28 to 32 MPG. Ride is great and steering is dependable in rain and sun. A pleasure to drive on freeways as well as mountain roads. We had a QX4 for 5 tears and the VUE outdoes the QX4 on all accounts excepy offroad. But we knew we were not purchasing a 4 wheel drive. Combining 4WD in the VUE would be a motorhome owners dream car. LOVE this little car. Buy one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The hybrid Vue runs great and the gas mileage is 30mpg in local driving(26-35mpg range) The acceleration around town very good and improved to 10000 miles. The acceleration on the highway is adequate and the car downshifts on hills smoothly one gear at a time. Very quiet at higway speeds with little wind noise. The sattelite radioworks well. Seats 5 adults comfortably. The rear seats folds down easily for extra storage. Repeatly gets 35+ on long trips at 70MPH.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2007 Redline was an upgrade from my 2005 Vue. Basically the cars are the same mechanically but the Redline just says roadster. It stands out in a crowd and I love the power. I had a Subaru WRX before my Vue's. The Vue outperforms and is much roomier than the Subaru's. I love the all wheel drive, room, the dent resistant panels which are no longer available in 2008. Come on Saturn bring them back! That was what made your product unique. I love my Redline. Too bad they had to change it. Love the Honda motor and hope to keep this for a long while. 22 mpg over all on the average is great for the size of the engine/vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So my husband and I bought this car a couple of weeks ago. We took it through the mountians up to Edmonton Alberta from Everett, Wa. Wow...could this car drive through ice, snow and mountians. The traction control works wonderfully. Except for the other drivers freaking me out the car was smooth and the gas mileage was fantastic we were getting at least 30mpg through the mountians and snow. We filled up twice on our way home and we were driving for 15 hours. That is so amazing to me. I would recommend this car to anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my VUE based on largely on the sticker mileage of 27-32 mph. HAHA!!! I'm getting 22-24 around town and 28-30 on the freeway (average driving, not a lead foot). I got around the same mileage with my Accord EX which had a V6 engine and was a much smoother ride. Plus I've had to have the hybrid battery replaced once already. I like the cargo area for my dog and the interior space is good for both front and back seat passengers. But I'd get something else if I got to choose all over again</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our relationship started out great and we always enjoyed driving the VUE. Went downhill as soon as we hit the 14,000 mark. First had a window motor needing to be replaced, then a strut mount needed to be replaced. The tech put the assembly to gether wrong and it made a load noise on every bump. After another two visits they found the spring was not seated in the assembly proper. After the 4 visit we still have a sound coming from one side of the front end.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I bought the Vue Redline after we had a baby. We couldn't be happier with it! She loves the reliability and easy access for the baby, I love the styling and features it offers. The basic Vue doesn't appeal to me at all, but the Redline package really adds a lot! The bumper kits and side skirts look great, giving it a lower look. Plus the black on black color looks great. The interior is very confortable- the suede inserts on the leather seats make having leather seats not such a pain. We hit a deer while driving at night at 55 mph- the only damage was a 3" scuff on the fender- incredible!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We've put roughly 12,000 miles on the VUE and it's worked wonderfully. I average mid to high 20's in a mix of city and highway driving, and have topped out at 31mpg on a long trip up the coast. Many cars of the same size can't compete with that, let alone other small SUV's that often have less cargo space. This car is by no means a luxury vehicle, but for around $18k brand new with a 100,000 mile warranty, it's hard to beat for a daily driver. The fold down seats have been really useful with the capability to fit full 8 foot boards and still carry three people including the driver.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Low cost of ownership (just oil and filter changes and tire rotations up to 100k) Low cost of purchase great mpg very roomy (great headroom, I'm 6'3" and have lots of space even with the sunroof Unlike every other compact suv, the VUE offered every single option except AWD on the base model</FAVORITE>

It has been in all the service dept of the Bayarea, Pleasanton, Livermore and Stockton California. I commute a lot and break down in all those cities. Good Luck if you decide to purchase a vehicle that is unreliable. My Vue has a number of repairs not consider to be recalls and the consumer will never know the truth about the Saturn new line of Hybrids are abysmal.

<TEXT>I've had my Green Line for about a year. It's been completely reliable and has never been in the shop for anything but periodic maintenance. I drive on largely short trips, which is not where the Green Line's hybrid system shines. I've seen highway trips with mileage close to 35 MPG, but my overall mileage right now is at 26.1 MPG. That's better than some "full" hybrid SUVs. Generally, the GL beats the highway mileage but fails to meet city mileage rating, especially in stop-and-go traffic. If that's what you're looking for, the GL will dissapoint. For me, there's enough suburban and highway to make it a success mileage-wise. I'm very happy with the choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just took the first step and called one. How long am I supposed to put up with this? At 17k miles the car started issuing the battery and engine malfunction warning lights with a few other icons thrown in. Then, engine shut-downs and loss of electrical power in mid-traffic. The eco light often disappears and I get no hybrid fuel economy. I just fill-up at the pump like everyone else. I use the car as a taxi. Imagine what my passengers thought when I had to pump the accelerator (and them) to safety as the engine failed and loss of electric power caused the steering wheel to lock on a local highway. Saturn just wants to keep "repairing" it with different parts. It's been a year, now.</TEXT>

Most I have gotten is 25.4 MPG on short trip (154 miles) and around town I get 17 to 19 MPG. If you stomp on the gas it will suck some gas. So far so good. Satisfied so far. Want to go on longer trip over Thanksgiving and check out the gas mileage. Very happy with Saturn. Think I made good choice.</TEXT>

We have no problems with the VUE, we have driven it 9,000 miles and towed behind our class A motorhome for another 8,500 miles...all completely uneventful. We thought that we would miss the Lexuses but couldn't get one since they are not flat towable. The VUE is simple to tow and only needs to be started every 7 hours to circulate the transaxle fluid. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm very disappointed in this vehicle. I have had several scary driving events in which the car jumped, lunged, and/or stalled for no apparent reason. It has been in for service and repaired several times. In addition it only gets 22 miles per gallon -- pretty bad for a hybrid. I think the poor gas mileage and the problematic engine/electrical system must be related but the service department denies that there is a problem. They say their problems are no worse than the Toyota Prius. I find it odd that they justify their problems by another manufactures problems. I will never buy a Saturn or GM product because of these problems and how I have been treated by Saturn.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you are looking for a vehicle to pull your boat or camper or to climb to the top of the mountain it had best be a pop up trailer and a very small mountain. The Vue delivers a good comfortable ride but you had best know what your giving up performance wise. It does travel well on the flat and narrow and the mileage which is one of the main reasons we purchased the Green is about what we expected, 25 around town and we have gotten 30 on the highway. It will hold a bit of stuff but it's not a four wheeler. It does get a bit of attention on the road and lots of questions at the gas stations. Fit and finish are good, but it leaves you wanting more.</TEXT>

I have to say that this is great on gas mileage, and there are a lot of features that you would expect from an SUV that was more expensive. Pickup is what you would expect from a 4 cylinder, but it's great for around town driving! I take mine on 1400 mile road trips- this was exceptionally comfortable with plenty of room for people to spread out as well as luggage. I felt a lot safer with OnStar.

<TEXT>Now that I have my Saturn Vue Greenline Hybrid I will never own anything else. I have owned Saturns for years, but the advantage of this one is that it has cut my commuter gas bill in half! I'm getting even better mileage than the dealership said I would. An added advantage is that you can use the battery to power the air conditioning or the gas (like a normal car). I have used it on both and there is no difference! So, of course, I use the battery to power the air conditioning. Both my 18 year old and my 2 1/2 year old love the comfort! And the dog loves the cargo area! Good job once again, Saturn!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Vue and I wish I had heeded the quality issues I had with my first. This one has simply been a nightmare to own. 6 weeks after purchase the clutch cable broke and it had to be towed back to the dealer. Now I've had it just shy of 1 year and it's been into the dealer for a recurring problem with deceleration at least 5 times, each time they keep it for almost a week!! I think I am almost qualified for the lemon law. When coasting to a slower speed while exiting a freeway once it drops below 50 mph if I try to accelerate again I get nothing - the pedal can go to the floor and there is no response. Speed drops, RPMs drop. Dealership can't seem to fix it. </TEXT>

We just made a 6 hour trip with 3 adults 1 child and a car seat in the back, and it was a comfortable ride. I will definetely by another Saturn.

<TEXT>After trying to talk each other into other Saturn models we compromised on the VUE. So far, so good! The ride is comfortable and quiet for the most part. Fit and finish is very good despite reviews from various auto magazines in the past. We chose our VUE in Polar White, and believe me when I tell you that this is the color to chose down here in sunny South Texas. We had wind noise while driving home on the interstate. We came to the concluson that it was due to the angle the wind was buffeting us, since the noise came and went. We'll have the retailer look at it soon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had for it 4 months and put 5000 miles on it. Roomy, handling is good. Rear seats can be fold down so you will have plenty of cargo room. No cargo cover though, not even a design let you put one so no after market cargo cover either. I knew the 4 cyl one will have less power so I got the manual one to better control it. Still powerless. I push for 4k~5k rpm on 1st gear but it is still slow. Mileage is OK, better than other SUVs. I get 21.3 local and 23~24 on highway. If you stay around 65 mph on hiway you will get better mileage but that is too slow for me. About 3.7K rpm at 80mph. Gear ratio at 5th gear need to be adjusted.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were instantly interested in the Green Line when we first saw it. We moved from a mini-van to the VUE to keep with the good mpg and cargo capacity. We ordered the car the way we wanted it (with all the options) and find it to be comfortable, practical, and economical. Mileage has been as advertised, running 26 mpg on the first tank in the dead of Wisconsin winter, to between 29 and 33 in early summer - mostly rural driving. The options have been worth it, especially the sunroof, heated seats, and XM radio. Drive it like a hybrid (easy does it) and be rewarded with good milage and decent handling - like a sports car (it's *not* one) and be disappointed. Looks nice outside, OK inside.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel mileage. Hybrid system. Powerful enough. Sunroof. Heated leather seats. Full set of airbags. Classy green exterior with alloy wheels. Oil life monitor. XM radio w/aux input. On-Star.

<AUTHOR>Love That Hybrid</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Right off the dealer lot, I got 31.9 MPG. With each tank of gas, the mileage has improved to where I am consistently getting 33 MPG beating the EPA ratings. The key to getting the mileage is adjusting your driving techniques to achieve the recommended hybrid fuel economy. The more the "ECO" light is on the better mileage you get. I love the car and am so glad I bought one! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Hybrid technology that delivers better than EPA mileage ratings.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only had my Saturn Hybrid for a couple of weeks, and I am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase. I haven't taken time to check out the gas mileage yet, but I can already tell it is better than that of my old Lumina 6cyl. I love my new Saturn VUE.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The fact that the electric motor takes over when stopped. This saves much gasoline when you are in line at a drive through or in heavy traffic.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>my first saturn</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I am a large individual. and i was driving an F-150, but my new job forced me to get a new car because of the mileage. I drive 140 miles roundtrip to and from work. I was looking for something roomy yet good on gas. I almost got a Ford Escape but the driver seat is set too high for the driver view. So I found myself looking at the Saturn VUE, and i must say it is a blast to drive. If you step on it it goes. It helps with that Honda 3.5v6. Very nice. I love it. No regrets.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2007 Saturn VUE handling is acceptable. Engine noise through the cabin is noticable. Mileage on recent 2000 mile trip averaged 23 on hwy. Car was delivered new with a large crack in the roof frame allowing water into the cargo area. Robots were asleep when assembly took place. Saturn North America says they will weld defect but not warranty it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It drives nice, handles very well and is comforable to drive. The passenger seat could be improved for comfort by making the seat more flexible in range up and down and other adjustments. Storage is adequate for the size of the vehicle and is what we expected when we downsized.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had no idea it was fast as it turns out to be. Running 45 MPH and step on it to pass, you better have both hands on the wheel. The six speed Auto trans is really fun.

<TEXT>Traded in 2006 Tiburon for more space. I was hesitant because I was getting 30 mpg with the Tiburon. I only have 400 miles on the VUE so after it breaks in I am sure I will get at least 1 mpg better. So far I drove 102 highway miles filled up with 3.3 gallons and got 30.7 mpg. Then I drove 59.5 city miles filled up with 2.02 gallons for 29.5 mpg and finally 82.2 mostly highway miles filled up with 2.7 gallons for 30.4 mpg. Granted I haven't gone faster than 65 mph but usually don't. I think the main factor for the mileage is resisting the temptation of accelerating hard. Nice and gradual and it pays off! So far I really enjoy the VUE.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Headroom, polymer side panels, and gas mileage for a vehicle that I feel safe driving. Also Saturn giving you 30 days/1500 miles to exchange vehicle for a different Saturn. That is why I am checking gas mileage so often. If it isn't good I trade down to a Ion 3 Quad</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is stable and true to it's EPA mileage. True 29 to 32 highway and 22 to 24 in town. While this is not 50 mpg this is a small SUV with nice room inside and good manners all around. The hybrid system is seamless and there is no negative to it that I have found. My hope is to run it for a long time. I have had no problems. Great car nice price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just bought this SUV and really like the design and look. Good gas mileage! The base model has electric everything, self dimming lights,cruise OnStar, phone, directions, side air bags, and $4000 incentive. It is quiet and steady, a well rounded choice. It not a race car, but for soccer, camping and going to the lake it fills the bill.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Over-all we love the Vue, but have just had a wheel bearing failure on the newest Vue after only 12K miles. A coworker has a 2006 Vue and has had to replace the left front wheel bearing twice. Symptoms appear as road noise that you think is tire noise on pavement as they wear. I knew I had a problem when I went form pavement to a dirt road the pitch of the noise never changed. Dealer has confirmed its a bad bearing. A dissapointing run of bearing failures that appears to be ongoing into the 2007 model year.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very smooth ride and reasonably comfy on trips, about as good as you can get for $18k. Still a saturn believer. I thought the 2.2L would be sluggish but has decent enough power for the size of vehicle. My ION had 90k miles when I traded and had the same engine and never had a problem with it, so I am glad to know GM made a good engine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am 6'4" and need the fuel economy of a compact but can't get a comfortable fit in one. SUVs fit me better but typically the initial cost of ownership and fuel economy scares me away. Hello Saturn Vue. I was able to get the 5 speed, 4cyl option for 30ish mpg. The cab is roomy even for me. Power is just what you'd expect from a 4cyl but acceptable. The ride is comfortable and the handling is very responsive. The electronic power steering does take a little getting used to. I am very pleased with this vehicle and would buy again tomorrow. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the second Saturn VUE I've owned and they are truly the best midsize SUV on the road. I can tow a 12ft utility trailer with ease and still have the ride of a luxury vehicle. They get great gas mileage and the 3.5L V-6 has more power than I know what to do with. I can't wait to see the redesigned '08 VUE that will be out this fall. I also see that GM has a 2-mode Hybrid VUE that will role out in '08 that keeps the V-6 power plant and is combined with two electric motors and gets 45% better gas mileage. I can't wait, I would by one tomorrow! GM rules!</TEXT>

<TEXT>A great combination of utility and economy for the price. Excellent interior layout--very classy and comfortable. Engine is quiet and responsive, though not neck-snapping. Very transparent hybrid system--easy to forget you're driving a hybrid. We get right on the EPA average--27 in town and 32 minimum on the highway. Truly an economical and capable vehicle--and one of the few hybrids likely to yield a return on your investment. No problems to date. Check it out!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The '07 Vue is a nice-looking car. Good pickup. It even seems more powerful than the V8 SUV I traded. I like the steering wheel radio controls, safer. It seems roomy enough, even though it is much smaller than my old SUV. I had to get used to it being lower than my old SUV as well as the window buttons not being on the window, but so far not a problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had this vehicle for 4 days and have driven it 275 miles! I can't stay out of it. This is my 3rd Saturn, the first two were the basic SL and then an Ion 2. All have been 5 speed manuals. I loved the Ion at first, it being new and all but the novelty wore off quickly. That said, my only 2 musts were a 5 speed, leather and of course A/C since I live in the south. The Vue is exceptionally roomy for a small SUV with plenty of headroom for a larger person. We are all small in my family so there is lots of room! My daughter loves the XM radio so I think we will keep it. 2 family members plan on purchasing one in the near future so Saturn must be doing something right with this one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow, I never thought that I'd seriously consider a Vue but here I am and I love it. The Honda V6 is great and actually matches the gas mileage rating of my old car ('00 Pontiac Grand Am GT). Plenty of space for my job-related activities and for fun. The interior look, with the wood- grained panels, and clean finish makes the Vue look more expensive than it really is. Add on the GM [powertrain warranty, OnStar, and other incentives for all '07 models and this is a can't miss buy. Check it out before you give up on GM!</TEXT>

<TEXT>No one is more surprised than me that I really love my new Saturn VUE. I have never owned an SUV or a GM product before - I have always had 2- door sports cars, mostly made in Japan. I am most impressed with the power and the roominess (for a small SUV) of my VUE. I really like the way the interior looks and the comfort of the seats, as compared with many of the other SUV models I test-drove. It has a smooth, quiet ride and a lot of features and upgrades found on pricier SUVs. Plus, I couldn't beat the 0% financing. So far, I am very satified.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought the Redline VUE 6 cyl. Fun to drive best power of the crossover SUVs. The Redline apparance package is great, it really dresses up the look af the VUE. Makes it stand out in a crowd of SUV clones. the 18" wheels and sport suspension provide great feel on the road. My other car is a 2004 vette so I wanted something with some power and better handling then the spongy SUVs that were out there. This is not an off road SUV but I don't do any off roading so doesn't matter to me. Great feature is the ability to fit two bikes inside of vehicle with bike rack. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first Saturn I have owned. It is the best car I could have purchased. It comes standard with every little luxury available, power, heated seats, remote start, OnStar. The Vue handles so good, smooth ride, comfortable seating. I have the V6 and it really is got great horsepower. My Dad works for GM and I can't believe that I was in such a rut with the Ponitacs, and Chevys of the world. This is the best car I have ever owned, I look forward to driving it everyday. Great gas mileage too!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the radio controls on the steering wheel. Being from Michigan the heated seats are a blessing in the cold winter mornings!

<TEXT>I just purchased a 2007 VUE back in October of '06 and have been very pleased with it thus far. I needed something that had a lot of cargo space and still got decent gas mileage. I got all that plus a nice looking, comfortable ride with all the amenities I could have wanted. I do a lot of in-town driving in my job and haul a lot of sizable equipment on a fairly regular basis. The fold down seats are great, I thought I'd never use the cargo organizer but now I use it all the time. Gas mileage has been pretty consistent at about 22 mpg with a blend of city and highway driving. I'm driving an SUV and filling up once every two weeks! Almost the same frequency as with my 2003 ION 4 cyl automatic</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the cabin setup and center console. The cargo space and organizer are great. Steering wheel audio controls and auxilliary jack for my iPod are very thoughtful. Gas mileage is very good and the 5spd manual is very easy and fun to drive.</FAVORITE>
