<TEXT>This car has some major issues and I don't have to repeat all what has been said by others. This car has amazing brakes and speed. It can take off like it was sports car.. not bad for 2 ton SUV. Every thing else is rubbish, the ride is very harsh, the tires are crap, and AC is not cold at all. I sold mine and got ML350 and I can tell the difference in the built quality.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>**CX7 - JuNK!***</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Every single day I drove my car I have loved it! One day driving home from taking my daughter to school my car starting making a loud clanking noise and smoke came from the back of the car. I took it in for regular maintenance and was told that my turbo was blown and the coolant to the turbo had a leak. I took it to the mazda service department and they told me it was not covered under warranty and I would pay about 4,000-5,000 for new engine/turbo. What a nightmare, now I am paying a car note on a car that is parked in my garage. I can't afford the repairs and I am soon forced to file bankruptcy to have this nightmare end!! *** BEWARE</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just crossed 36000 miles on my CX-7 FWD GT. I got it with the tech package, so it is loaded. Have had all the recommended services done. As I write this, the gas cap problem occurred way back in June 2007. Otherwise, the car has been exceptionally fun to drive. Get about 21 mpg (what I expected) and drive 60/40 highway/city. No a/c to rear, which is a bummer for the kids. That would be my biggest gripe. Also, the tires lasted to 30k, and i'm on my 2nd set. Otherwise, this has been a great car for me and my family. The fun-to- drive factor is off the charts. I live driving down two-lane country roads with inclines and curves. The car just responds so incredibly well. Go for it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I first saw a CX-7 on the road, I wanted one immediately. A couple months later I then owned one.. and for the first 2 years and 5 months later, and 52,000 miles into owning this vehicle the A/C compressor went out. The worst part is that because the check engine light and/or the temp on the vehicle never told me that there was a problem. So to my surprise when I finally got off the freeway, after driving home about 250 miles... my car was literally a ball of smoke. The AC compressor went out and then affected the idler pully, some other type of pully, the harmonic balancer, and ultimately affected the engine...no compression left. They wanted $12,900 to fix it... </TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow, I am not really shocked at all the complaints but i am glad to see that i am not the only one in distress, I bought this junk brand new in 2007 and now it sits in my back yard not running at all. My timing chain broke at 56,00 miles, YES, and when it broke so did my engine. I always had thoughts that this car was junk because I would hear a rattle from time to time after acceleration and then a puff of smoke and check engine light stayed on, ac is horrible for back passengers, horrible, There needs to be a recall on this SUV nothing but junk and know I have a to pay for a car that's need 10,000 worth of work, I had this car serviced every 6000 miles now look, JUNK JUNK JUNK stay away</TEXT>

<TEXT>3 years of problems, everything from AC compressor to turbo, Some things died at least twice (turbo). All kinds of noises, hesitation and pieces breaking left and right. Check engine light at least 2 times a month. Forget winter... You will get stuck in nominal snow. Tires went bald right away. Sun visors, trims, and other items broken lost or came off while driving. Terrible knocking noise from the fuel injectors while idle. Oil change is 2 hour nightmare. Gets under 15 MPH on HIGHWAY!!!! With premium gas. Check other forums, a lot of problems reported. Mazda dealers are not that friendly. Car came back from service with more problems than going in. Never buy mazda again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is 4th review. I still like my CX-7 despite, the fuel sensor light defect still arises when I punch it getting into the flow of traffic from entrance ramps. At 87,000 miles I had the a/c compressor unit go out while traveling and was forced to find a dealership out of state. Because my local dealer monitored the repair process, I was able to avoid being over-charged $700.00 for new unit. The suspect dealership made right the overcharges when I presented them retail charge pricing from the manufacturer. I do enjoy the sports car like driving demeanor, but think the ac system should have lasted much longer. I now have 91,000 miles and have put purchased my third set of tires.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Mazda CX7 in 2007 and I regret it. Less than 1 year my Air compressor Blew. Then the AC after the year in January of 2009 It doesn't work now that the warranty is up, I have to pay. I took it to Mazda 1 wk after the Manufacturer Warranty was up, they said they couldn't help me. Oh by the way do not get the tire protection, its a waste of money they say that all mazda dearlers accept the assignment, NOT. I had to pay out of pocket. Couldn't do anything about it because dealership closed.</TEXT>

It's got good handling, great passing power, but the seats after a long drive gets a little uncomfortable. Over all it's a super car.

<TEXT>This car is gorgeous on the outside with the exception of the cheap plastic grille in front. The interior is well equipped but it is completely trimmed in plastic. Can definitely see where corners were cut to save money, like only having a map pocket on the back of the driver's seat. We love how easy the rear seats fold down. The stereo is strong for a stock system. Most importantly, this vehicle really gets up and goes. And as far as turbo lag goes, it is minimal at best. Any more power off the line and those expensive standard 18" tires would be smoked. One big negative, and probably only because we moved from an Acura TL into this vehicle, is the harsh and loud suspension. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle looks great on the outside, but is the most uncomfortable vehicle I have ever owned. Some features are over thought out. If the gas cap is loose the computer gives an error message and the message will not go away by correcting the problem and tightening the cap. No, you must go to the dealership to have it reset. It constantly gave me error messages when nothing was wrong according to the dealer. Minor things are missing, like a light by the mirrors on the visor, and setting the clock was nearly impossible. The dealer did not know how and I accidentally set it. The ride is very choppy, I felt every little dimple in the road. I could not wait to get rid of this vehicle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this car for my wife as her daily car. She loves it, I love it. Lots of style, the turbo is a blast and it looks great on the road (I noticed a lot of young ladies driving these on a recent business trip to Miami, but don't tell my wife). We haven't found the gas mileage to be a problem, probably getting around 500 kms to a tank of gas. We thought the level of standard features was ample and the level of comfort outstanding. The ride is firm and sporty without compromising comfort and I would recommend one of these without a second thought. The price was very reasonable also. Buy one!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Has 14,000 miles in 8 months and nothing is wrong. The check engine light and tire monitor light are on and off and on and off again. No big deal and I'll get used to it. Can't complain for this price, new SUV and far more reliable than my ML430 that I sold for CX-7. Some of us hate the turbo lag but I don't feel much of it. If there's a 2 seconds lag, I don't give a hoot because I'm in no rush.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's a cool car, but there are a few features missing that I wish would be in the car. Tiny thing, but the tiny things make all the difference. First off, there's no ash tray, no light for the mirror in the visor, no MP3 hookup, no light in the glove compartment, the doors don't automatically lock after starting the car and driving. Again, small things, but things that add up. It drives really well and you can adjust the driver seat to sit high feeling like an SUV or low feeling more like a sports car. The rear camera is awesome as is the keyless entry and keyless ignition.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>GPS is awesome. The leather package is extremely comfortable. Lots of leg room for rear passengers, the rear view camera is just about the best invention ever.

<TEXT>Traded in a Mazda3 for this new CX-7. To begin with the car does have a cool look to it and got a few stares here and there. Here's the thing, Mazda recommends Super Unleaded to get the full potential of the turbo engine. My MPG after break-in averaged 19 mpg combined city/highway easy driving, which just plain stinks. It has a major turbo lag, for instance if you punch it from a dead stop it feels like you have a 2 cylinder car, then after 2-3 seconds it suddenly accelerates. New firmware for the car's computer did help a little, though. The car was fun to drive and a pain to get in and out of due to the door sills being way high. Traded this CX-7 after 8200 miles. </TEXT>

My wife wanted more comfort and space than our Subaru Impreza WRX and and I wanted a "sporty" car. The CX-7 is the perfect combination of both. I don't regret selling my WRX for this car. Only bad point on the CX-7: the single CD player (and 6 CD player in option) doesn't play MP3s (seems only the 6CD player with NAV package is mp3 compatible)!! Come on! We are in 2007!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought CX-7 last Dec after many great reviews and prior experiences with a mx3. This will susequently be the last. CEL came on first week, followed by an electric control motor of some kind. Next we began to discover several oil spots resulting in a week stay at the dealer for differential leaks. Last week, the cx7 was diagnosed with needing a new transfer case due to new leak problems. Very dissatisfied and will more than likely avoid Mazda in the future. In addition, rust is beginning to bubble thru the chrome trim around windows. What next?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my car!! I almost wish my commute to work was longer because it's so fun to drive. I love the fact that their aren't too many others like mine on the road. Mazda does an awesome job - I've owned both a 323 hatchback (which I drove for 12 years with no problems) and a Tribute, and know that my next car will also be a Mazda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great performance, handles like a sport car, tracks well and has the ponies for highway driving. Winter driving was made easy with the AWD. Does need a block heater for prairie use though, once the battery starts to age it might be tough to crank in very cold -40C weather. Needs Bluetooth for MP3. The requirement for premium gas is a downer given fuel prices but mileage is not an issue so it's a wash. I drove 3 Caddys prior to the CX-7 and won't go back. For the money it is superior to the FX35 too. Test drive one today!</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far, I love this vehicle! Since I've only had it a short period of time (less than one month), my review of it isn't quite as thorough as some others. I'll be taking it overseas to the UK in a few months and I hope I love the handling of my CX-7 over there as much as I love it over here. Only 'beef' I have with this vehicle is totally based on aesthetics. I originally liked the Copper Red Mica, but it doesn't come with the black interior. Having two small children I needed the darker interior. So I got the Liquid Platinum Metallic, and it's growing on me *smiles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded a 2004 Mercedes C230 for the CX-7 because of all the hype about it and I wanted an SUV. Well what a mistake this was!! After 2000 miles the engine just didn't sound right and the check engine light kept coming on. When I took it to the dealer it was a week before they could even get to it!! Definitely not customer service oriented like luxury dealers are. Overall I was very disappointed in Mazda. Will never purchase another one again. I kept it for 4 months and then turned it in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the CX-7 for a little over 4 mths and really enjoy driving this vehicle. It drives more like a car than a truck. I previously owned a Subaru B-9 Tribeca 06. I love the CX7 styling, leather interior, heated seats, Nav etc. The CX7 handles better than the Tribeca, i.e., more fun to drive. The CX7 has a nicer looking Nav system but a trip computer/mpg readout should be integrated in for future models. MPG is better with CX7 by about 2mpg ie. about 17 w/ CX7 compared to 15 w/tribeca overall observed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I fell in love with the styling. I fell in love with the features. I fell in love with the handling. Then the honeymoon was over. After approximately 1800 miles on it, the engine started to sputter when it was cold. It idled fine. But as soon as you put it in gear, the engine would shake violently, & only rev to approximately 2k rpm when you mashed on the gas. The colder the weather the worse it was. 1st trip, dealer, they said it needed a software update. Didn't help. 2nd trip, tried to repair a valve. Didn't help. 3rd replace valve. 4th more software. It is on its 5th time and they don't know what is wrong (after 3 days). If it is not fixed this time, I will try to go the lemon law route. 8^(</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2006 BMW 325i, and I have been very happy with my CX7. I have found the engine to be very responsive with virtually no turbo lag, as it accelerates smoothly. It is stronger in the lower speeds which is where you want it. The ride is very good with good handling but still smooth. It has a great Bose stereo and the interior is well thought out and easy to use. I found the fuel economy to be right on with the urban mileage at 19 and the highway at 24. Now if you keep your foot hard on the accelerator and the turbo kicked in it obviously will be less as in all cars driven hard. I think the CX7 is a little more inviting to do this so the mileage is up to how you drive. </TEXT>

I was skeptical at first, as I am used to sedans, but the CX7 drives like a sedan and has the convenience of an SUV, without the big price tag or size. The CX7 has standard features that you would expect in higher end cars. As far as turning heads on the road, I can't tell if they're looking at me or the car! (HA). I highly recommend it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Mazda and they keep getting better! I love the styling and terrific value the CX7 represents. Plenty of room and the motor pulls this rig beautifully, especially on mountain roads. Have experienced very minor turbo lag and the 6-speed AT is wonderful, absolutely no need for a V6. This car is a cross-over, not a truck so it must be judged accordingly. For a car it's wonderful, for an SUV it serves all my needs. Finally someone came out with an SUV a guy like me can use. Don't need a truck? This is your rig! Modern, well developed cross-over SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the Tech Package, it's a must have. Seats are just right, firm without being hard, very "German" feeling. Handles precisely and the ride is compliant but just firm enough. Power is more than adequate with very slight turbo lag. AWD works as advertised. Plenty of bells & whistles.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded a V8 Ford Explorer that had tranny issues. I was looking for something smaller, reliable and more fuel efficient. I was concerned about giving up the power of the V8 but after one test drive I was hooked. I didn't really care to much for the FWD because of the torque steer when you get on the gas so I opted for the AWD. The AWD is seamless and well worth the extra $$$. I purchased the Touring addition with leather but really didn't want to pay for a bunch of features that I would never use in my daily drive to and from work. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been very happy with the CX-7. I have tried most of the competition and given the interior, exterior styling and the driving performance the CX-7 has them beat hands down. The only complaint I have thus far (@ only 500 miles) is that the gas mileage has been low. I know it will get better as the engine is broken in. I'm not at all dissatisfied though. You are going to pay for performance somewhere or you can drive something boring. Have fun, drive a CX-7!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My favorite feature is the turbo engine. Accelerating on the entrance ramp to merge onto the highway or turning the corner into traffic comes with such ease, and I feel like I barely have to hit the gas. This is something I grew so tired of with previous cars I owned...hitting the gas and feeling like I am going nowhere, and never going to get there. Passing semis and slow moving traffic is just so easy because once again I feel like I just zoom right past them. I guess it depends what you're used to, but the V4 turbo power blows away V6 engines I have driven previously. Additionally, this car handles well, and the height you drive at is great. I feel safe and in control. So much fun to drive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our CX-7 in January of 2007 and so far are very pleased with it. The engine is surprisingly powerful for a 4-cyl, and the turbo lag isn't as noticeable as some reviews led me to believe it would be. (Granted, I've never owned a turbo before, but compared to an '02 VW Jetta 1.8T I test drove once, this turbo lag is nothing!) I love the feel of the car - it's much more nimble than one might expect. Gas mileage, as everyone else mentions, could and probably should be better. (So far we're averaging around 20mpg with a decent amount of stop-and-go highway driving.) There are a few annoyances that I'm sure will be worked out in the '08, but overall I'd say it's a winner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is a little like a body builder. Looks great and impressive from a distance. However, when you really get to know it it's a little disappointing. I was very excited to buy this car but was so thoroughly unimpressed with the engine and performance I just couldn't get myself to buy it. The 4 cylinder turbo is jerky and lags quite a bit. The biggest problem is the fact that when you hit the gas the engine screams so loud you feel like it's in the passenger seat. I am a Mazda lover having owned two, I will re-visit the CX-7 when my wife gets ready to replace her vehicle I hope by then they change the powertrain.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Mazda CX-7 is a sporty SUV. The turbo hesitation in mine is now a thing of the past. Mazda came out with a service bulletin to correct the turbo lag and the check engine light problem. I just got back from the dealer and the turbo lag is gone it is much smoother on acceleration. Too soon to tell about the check engine light but it is supposed to be fixed to. I really enjoy the handling and looks of this vehicle. MPG has been a bit disappointing. I'm hoping this turbo recalibration also helps the MPG (avg. about 16 mpg). Overall if you are looking for a sporty SUV This one is definitely one to consider. Also the lease deals have been much better than on the RAV4 or CR-V. </TEXT>

I test drove a Mitsubishi Outlander, Toyota Rav4, Hyundai Santa Fe and Honda CR-V. None of them has the leg and headroom and the power of the CX-7. I am six feet two inches tall and 300 pounds and I fit in the car with lots of extra room. The four cylinder turbo is great. Only the Mitsubishi came close to the power and quickness of the CX-7.

<TEXT>Wile looking for a new small SUV for my wife, we drove FX35, Pilot, MDX, RX330, 4 Runner, Highlander, Explorer, Murano, etc. Price and options drove us to the CX-7. I was sold on the FX35, but wife was unwilling to spend the additional $10k. While we like the car, the turbo lag is a killer. I'm hesitant to pull out into traffic because it is so unpredictable. Also, I sense the engine runs slightly rough at highway speeds (70mph or around 2000rpm). I had it in once and they claim to have replaced the ignition coil. It also has a rattle they cannot find which sounds like the rear wiper is falling off at 60+mph. Not happy with the solutions so far, might trade it if they can't fix it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Researched the CX-7 heavily. Upon reading the reviews and test driving this SUV, I was very impressed. The lease on the Murano SE was up, and I got the Touring AWD with Bose, leather, moonroof, & foglights. Compared to the Murano SE, the CX-7 is much quicker, faster and more responsive than the Murano. The Murano is much heavier, and you need to floor it because of the CVT. The same features on the Murano, will cost you at least $36k. I have received a lot of compliments on the CX-7 and many people are amazed at the improvements Mazda have made in a lot of their cars & SUVs. Overall this is my first Mazda, like the commercial says, "zoom zoom, zoom"!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4 cylinder turbo; it's very nimble and quick, handling is great. The stiff ride is compromised by great handling, Bose stereo is amazing, I have no problem with the premium gas, you people have to be realistic, almost all turbo cars require premium gas.

<TEXT>We were looking for a vehicle with some cargo and good safety scores. The CX-7 delivered and much more. It was roomy enough for a three adults and a child. It has exceeded expectations in all departments except gas mileage. The sleek design does turn heads as well as its potent 244hp turbo. There is a little bit of turbo lag but the leather front seats are comfortable enough and give you that performance car feel. Handling is surprisingly good for $30k crossover. Love the xenon lights as well as the easy to read instrumentation panel. The premium fuel requirement is disturbing especially with today's gas prices. And the mileage could be better. Not satellite ready. It is an option.</TEXT>

The CX-7 has excellent road handling; please note that I've owned big Alfas and Lancias in Europe for years and I know what I am talking about, the brakes are the best I've ever driven in a car so far, the built quality much better than the all of the European cars I've owned and if the reliability proves to be just "Japanese" then there won't be a problem. </TEXT>

Quality is outstanding, ride is comfortable but firm (more like a sports car than like a plushy car). It handles superbly, and I didn't feel like there was any adjustment period coming from a smaller car - it felt natural to drive. I even parallel parked it the first week of ownership (of course, rear-view camera helps). I don't agree with anyone who says it needs a V6. There's no guarantee a V6 is going to take "regular" gas... look at the BMW. They also aren't more efficient. Look at real-world results from CUVs with the 6... they are averaging about the same MPG.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Too many to list... I love the turbo engine, blue illumination inside, heated seats, and nav system. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fast car, but loud while driving, can hear the road and anything that hit the inside wheel well. Sometimes it is uncomfortable. Kinda low to the ground. Not like a regular SUV. Very sporty and fun to drive but more like a sports car. Love the transmission, the ability to choose automatic vs. gears. Turns on a dime, very tight steering. rooming back seat. but small area in back. Traction control is good too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The CX-7 is the anti-Toyota. Toyotas are great reliable products, and there are many people who love the isolated ride, but for those who like to experience the "Sport" in SUV, the CX-7 is a great alternative. In all I am very happy with my CX-7, however there are things to note. First is the there is a noticeable turbo lag, which at times makes the acceleration a little unpredictable. The ride is definitely on the stiff side, which is great for cornering, but not so great for those who like a smooth ride. This also contributes to the road noise at highway speeds. There is some torque steer from the front wheel drive. In all it is a great car for those who don't want to buy a Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I chose the CX7 because of its sleek look and unconventional SUV styling. I bought it for under $21K after dealer special incentive. Logged over 1,200 miles in 2 weeks (since 11/11) and 2 lights lighted out like X-mas bulbs. My friendly sales rep helped me fixed the problem and just to be sure, they drove the car for 20 miles. 1st light was common problem due to overly sensitive sensor pin in the gas cap. Here in Oregon, gas attendant might be the perpetrator. 2nd light was due to low pressure tire sensor. After a thorough check, none of my tire was losing air. Aside from these 2 lights, I'm happy with the performance (though a bit sluggish at pick up) and look.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Needed something bigger than a sedan/wagonette, but smaller than SUV/van. Considered Murano, RAV4, Tribeca B9, Acura MDX. RAV4 too small, cheesy inside and jumpy. Tribeca too funky (ugly), poor shifting. For the money, the CX-7 blows the Murano (the most similar comparison), the Acura and even the B9 out of the water. Great deals to be had due to new model vehicle - paid invoice. Touring model is loaded to the gills with leather, Bose sound, sun roof, 18" wheels, great power/handling, traction & stability control, high performance tires, and keyless entry. 5 star crash ratings all around! Costs THOUSANDS less than similarly equipped models above (except RAV4). Mazda has a winner here! </TEXT>

<TEXT>We looked at the Infinite FX35 and were convinced this was our next vehicle. We saw a CX-7 on the road and within two weeks flew from Florida to New York to make the purchase. We got a great deal. The CX-7 is awesome and fun to drive. It has plenty of power and tons of cool features. The little things Mazda thought of to include are huge. A small blue light the illuminates the cup holder area at night with just enough light to hit the hole. The blue/orange back lighting and the upgraded headlamps with the GT Package are a must. The price was key. All the features of the FX35 without paying for the name.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car! Fun to drive; handles the curves through the mountains like on rails. Only complaints: check engine light comes on often. I am well aware of the gas cap causing this but that has not been a problem. Also it lags a little when you "punch it" from a stop - the turbo takes a bit to wind up. Could get a little better mileage and use regular gas.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the car for a couple of months. Very fun to drive, lots of power with the turbo. Very comfortable inside with plenty of room. Gas mileage for us has always been over 20mpg with the average being 22-24mpg with 70-80% highway. No real problems except when at highway speed transmission seems to be "confused" when in 5th-6th gear. Almost like it cannot decide which gear. According to others there is a new adjustment to fix the problem. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I had a second child which prompted us to start looking for something will more room like an SUV/CUV. We were trading in an Acura TL which is a fun car to drive. We were looking for something that was fun to drive like the TL but had more room. We started shopping around for an Acura RDX, Volvo XC90, Subaru Tribeca, and Nissan Murano. Then we found the CX-7. WOW! The test drive sold us on the spot. A fun ride with a model style that turns heads. It had great pickup and cornering. It had room for family use with a young sporty look and feel we were looking for. We ordered all of the extras except the Tech Package. The Bose system is crisp.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A head-turning design which fulfills its promise in my opinion. Outstanding performance feel but not yet broke in. However, you can tell it's there. Interior is comfortable and high-tech feeling. Steering is taut with good feel. Ride is firm but not hard. Just right in my opinion. First fuel refill, took 10 gallons for 182 miles, about what is predicted. When broken in, it will be a barrel of fun to drive as all turbo cars with a 6 speed transmission should be. Shifts are smooth and powerful. Anyone liking modern design and high tech cars should love this automobile. Heads turn constantly which says volumes for its looks. A winner!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ditto prior reviews. Wanted a fun & functional AWD SUV. Own & love a 98 Honda CR-V, but disappointed in the 2007. Researched & tested 2007 CX-7, all Toyota SUVs, Murano, Pathfinder & CR-V - but when I drove the CX-7 (1st & last of the test drives) I smiled a lot and so did my husband. Bumpy start with the dealership but once I drove off with AWD, Tech Package, Dim Mirror with HomeLink, satellite radio & more, I've been happy. The gas cap needs to be replaced. Gas mileage has been better than expected. From the handling & solid feel to the Navigation & Sat radio, this car is FUN and our teenager & his friends always ask if we're taking the Mazda - which we've affectionately dubbed "The Zoomer."</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a fun car when it's not in the shop. Gas cap replaced; turned on engine service light. Transaxle went out 22,ooo miles. Fuel gauge showed half tank, I ran out of gas on major city highway during rush hour. Fuel sending unit replaced. Turbo went out 42000 miles. Original tires lasted 20,000 miles. (soft tread) I've tried 5 different mazda dealers and have had the worst service I've ever experienced. Their techs and mechanics are incompetent. I've been lied to about oil changes. Had to take car back 4 and 5 times for repair issues. Example: floats not adjusted properly after sending unit replaced, digital key malfunction, they damaged fenders said my fault. ETC.

<TEXT>This is a very annoying vehicle. It was the first one delivered in the area and no doubt has some new model quirks, but that does not explain a vehicle delivered with major misalignment that scrubbed the first tires in 10k miles, nor the turbo lag, nor the awful gas mileage (17-19 in almost all country driving), nor the terrible handling in snow (except straight ahead), nor the brakes that went metal to metal in 20k miles. It's pretty and fun on dry curvy roads, but overall it is a loser and will not be bought or repeated at lease end.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been a very happy motorist for the first 60,000 miles put on my Mazda CX-7. This is my third review for this car. My car averages between 19-21 mpg. I do lots of highway traveling and I usually travel 200+ mile trips. My OEM tires lasted for 28,000. My second set of tires (not factory but dealer recommended and cheaper) will probably be replaced at 80,000. Until 60,000 I had absolutely no issues with this car. About 60,000 the fuel sensor started coming up. I have identified I trigger this failure when stepping on the gas during exit ramp to highway acceleration events.

<TEXT>Getting in and out of the vehicle has been made very user friendly with the use of the advanced keyless entry. Walk up to the vehicle open the door, get in, and start the vehicle without any key. The CX-7 is very responsive in the throttle and in the steering. Thus far I enjoy this more than my 2005 BMW 330Xi as far as space, entry, creature comforts, versatility of options, & of course riding at elevation. With the sport transmission, getting from 0-60 is more than quick enough. The ride on the 18's is just right. Handles like a sports car and takes road imperfections like a luxury. This vehicle is spirited and insightful. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After looking around at a few different vehicles, I came across the CX-7. Although I was looking at things like CTS's and A4's, the CX-7 won me over. Has to be the most fun SUV to drive and be seen in because attention is what this SUV seems to attract. A lot of people say it looks like a Lexus and in galaxy gray, it really looks as if it cost $50,000 or more. I drive all highway and seem to be getting 27mpg with the cruise set at 70 and about 21 in town as long as you stay off the boost. The interior is extremely well built with almost Audi fit and finish levels. I can't say enough how much I enjoy driving this SUV, maybe me putting 300 miles on it in the first 3 days I got it says how much.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this SUV for about three weeks and it is a great ride. I got the Black Cherry Mica with two toned sandy leather...sweet. I got it for $300 over invoice. In the market for a small SUV (RAV4, CR-V) took the CX-7 for a test and we were hooked. My last car was a Mazda, and it was very reliable. It had never seen the inside of a service center. CX-7 has a smooth ride, the only problem was the check engine light came on due to a faulty gas cap which is going to be recalled. Don't let the 4 cylinder fool you, this ride is swift. It is roomy & my pregnant wife could not be happier. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just had my GT Tech package CX7 delivered to me Friday night (10/6/06) and used it immediately on a 550 mile trip to Plainfield Mass. and back. Here's the skinny. Sound system...everything everyone said about it was correct. Rocks power...better than expected for the weight, nice acceleration. Tech package...must have, simple as that. Handling... by far the best thing about the car. I was doing about 75mph on serious switchbacks up in the mountains and I can honestly say that this car handles about as well as my old Mitsubishi 3000GT VR4 did, and that was a high end sports car.

<TEXT>Was tired of commuting and carting kids to sporting events in a car that had bad gas mileage and was always dirty. Selected the Mazda as an affordable, reliable and bad weather capable car that I wouldn't mind getting a bit dirty. Looked at the Tribeca and RDX. Tribeca drove like a mini van and the MDX was overpriced.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Like the manual shift capability - really fun, the lines of the car are clean and modern, navigation system, keyless entry system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After owning several vehicles over the year my standards are very high when it comes to new vehicles. The CX7 is great value. It's not the best crossover out there but it is the best for the money spent. Good performance, nice ride with just the right amount of options. First Mazda, let's see how it goes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Knowing that this vehicle will go when asked, stop when needed and take curves with aplomb, brings joy back to driving. A driver can have one's cake and eat it with both an automatic and a six speed manual transmission all in one. Have owned this vehicle for one month and have put on 1500 miles in all terrain except off road driving. Climbed Mt. Whiteface which was a kick. Driving curvy back roads in the mountains was a hoot. Thruway driving was rock steady too. I look for excuses to go to the store taking the long way around and back. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear view backup camera is a very strong safety feature giving an excellent rear view and aids in parking as part of the navigation unit. Brakes are phenomenal as is the handling. Very good fit and finish.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love my CX-7!!This is the most enjoyable care to drive I've ever owned. It's very responsive. Exactly as the advertised. Feels like a large sports car, and this is what I was looking for. The build is extremely solid. Interior is very nice. It could use a few more luxury accents. All in all very sharp and functional. Some reviewers said ride was too stiff. I find it perfect for me. The engine is so quiet, but when you give it gas, it sounds like a sports car should. Fantastic sound system and acoustics. As far as cargo room. Some say it's not very big. Ok, it's supposed to be like a large sports vehicle. However, in my recent move, I could easily carry up to 8 large boxes at a time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>So much fun to drive! Effortless, tight turns and very quick turbo engine. I can pass on the freeway, in all 6 gears, quickly. The look of this vehicle is just outstanding. I get looks everywhere I go. I'm a high school teacher. When my students saw it in the parking lot, they were blown away!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>There is a huge blind spot when backing up, the cockpit is rather tight; the large wheels make getting in and out more difficult than I realized at first. It is fun to drive, but the cabin space is more limited than I realized at first. The fuel gauge is hard to see and I have almost run out of gas twice. The ride is very smooth and it accelerates quickly. The tires are set very wide and I have hit a curb several times already.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I shopped the Acura RDX, Murano, and 2007 CR-V (through internet). My Grand Touring AWD with Bose blew my mind. My family owns all Hondas, as did I (2004 V6 accord Aoupe). The CX-7 made me change car companies. The value of this truck is unreal and should be considered if you are looking for a mid range SUV. Handling, styling, features, and standard equipment make this a STANDOUT among its competitors. Once you test drive and see this in person, it will alter your shopping list that day.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always had a family car, van, sedan etc. This one I bought for me...okay the wife too. I have had it only for the weekend now. Without the expletives, it's FUN! The handling is great, someone said low end power not good, what? This is peppy. I drove the Murano also, which is really what I intended to get, but after test driving this, WOW, this one made the impact on me. I love this car, put 200 miles on it in 2 days. Any reason to go to the store, I go, even if it's just for toothpicks. I know this is not a technical review. I too can not stop looking at it, it's a head turner, I like watching people when the first see it, DOUBLE TAKE! Love turning those heads.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sportiness, fun to drive, powerful, great in turn even at high speed, the steering makes it very easy to make a fast curve.

<TEXT>I have owned four SUV's to date and love the versatility but wanted something a little smaller and sportier. I looked at the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4 and Nissan Murano but none of these compare to my beautiful copper mica CX-7. I get compliments from people all the time which has never happened before, with the exception of tooling around in my little 1991 Miata of course. This car handles like a sportscar, is very roomy and takes off like I can't believe! I actually have to be careful when accelerating because it has a LOT of power for a 4-cylinder engine.

<TEXT>Okay, I admit that styling was the #1 reason I bought my CX-7. There is simply nothing else like it on the road. It also has sufficient pep, but handling is really its strong suit, dynamically. It's like an RX-8 on stilts. I'm a bit worried that it's not the frugal runabout I thought it was when it comes to mileage, but then again, I'm only working on my third tank of gas. Overall, if it lives up to the typical Japanese build-quality expectations, I'll be ecstatic. If you have to do it all with one stylish car, this is it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded in what was the best car we had ever owned (an 05 Mazda3 hatchback) to get our new CX-7 and what a good trade it was! The 3 is zippy & handles itself well and the CX-7 has the same solid feel, plenty of power and a good feel of the road. It doesn't corner like the 3 but it is smooth through the corners with more than enough power to pleasantly surprise you and the suspension makes for a nicer ride than the 3. It's very comfortable on long rides and the sound proofing has improved. I am very impressed with the power of the 2.3 turbo and am often surprised by the amount of 'takeoff' power there is through the first 3 gears of the 6 speed automatic. And it gets 23 mpg so far! WOW!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was in the market for a larger AWD car to replace my wife's current BMW 528i. We test drove Honda, Toyota, Ford, BMW, Suzuki, Volvo and all were either poor performers or overpriced. The CX-7 combined the performance and value we were looking for in a car which is fun to drive. The Sport version comes with quite a few standard options though we added the driver electric seat and remote start. The car's only negative in my opinion is the turbo-lag which doesn't kick in until 2000 RPM. In terms of value, the CX-7 is $3k-$15k cheaper than its competition (Pilot, Murano, X3).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking for a fun-to-drive AWD car/suv under $30K, and frustrated with poor reliability from VW/Audi. This fit the bill to a Tee. It looks great and gets comments and compliments from friends and strangers. It has terrific acceleration (especially passing), and handles curves like a sports car. Braking is superb. The Bose sound system rocks, and interior space is comfortable and functional. I drove the RAV4 and Murano and the driving experience was vastly better in the CX-7 (distinctly un-truck-like compared to the competition). Lastly, compared to equivalently equipped BMW M3, Volvo, Murano, Audi A7, even Subaru B9 Tribeca it was $5-10K less expensive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased this vehicle for my wife and it has exceeded our expectations from the get go. Everything about this vehicle is fantastic. We purchased the 2007 Grand Touring AWD. Color: Copper Red Mica. The only item that my wife didn't want was the Navigation System. I own a business and I am thinking about purchasing another one for myself (except with the navigation system). The Navigation System has a camera mounted at the rear and when you put the vehicle in "Reverse" the camera comes on and shows up on the Navigation Screen (very nice idea, especially if you have small children). I would suggest that you go out to your local dealer and test drive one, you will be hooked right away! </TEXT>

Finally the local dealer got in a CX-7. The functionality of the vehicle sold my wife, and the surge from the turbo sold me. We've had it for a week now and so far I'm happy with it. My biggest complaint is that the ride is a little stiff. It takes corners like a champ, but I can see how it can get tiring after a 4+ hour trip.</TEXT>

It is very "zippy" and I have NEVER heard a sound system in a car that was like the Bose sound system this thing has. The color we bought is Pearl White and we have the Technology Package.

<TEXT>I took delivery only two weeks ago, so this review may be a bit premature. But I'm really happy with the car so far. I test drove all the vehicles in its class before deciding on the CX-7. It's clearly designed to take on the Nissan Murano and does so with panache. I'm a big Nissan fan (my other car is a Maxima and the CX-7 replaced a Pathfinder). I was impressed with how the CX-7 stacked up against the Murano in every possible way--for several thousand dollars less on a comparably equipped car. The CX-7 lives up to its "zoom zoom" billing. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power and handling are excellent. You need to keep your eye on the speedometer: It's easy to find yourself doing 85-90 mph on the highway as the engine hasn't begun to break a sweat at that point.

Able to zip ahead when you want to pass, whether you're going 30 or 80. Handling and braking are very good. Handles turns and cloverleafs much better than other SUVs without feeling like the car is leaning. Exterior styling is great.

<TEXT>We first saw the CX-7 at the Chicago auto show this past winter and my wife and I decided it was the vehicle for us. Since we took delivery (6/03/2006) we've been very impressed with the performance and styling of the car. The utility features of the CX-7 were in keeping with why SUVs are purchased in the first place. It only has slightly less room than that of our previous Mazda Tribute. I am sure its reliability will be just as solid as any other Mazda - this being our 6th Mazda. The only negative is the ease of scratching the plastic on the dash, glove box and the door panels. It looks rather cheap and it is very easily scratched. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle has nice sporty performance, SUV or not. Good acceleration despite "turbo lag," which can be obnoxious. Quality interior, though somewhat bland appearance. Bose sound system very nice. Decent gas mileage, but premium fuel requirement is expensive - should have used V-6 which probably would have given same MPG with no premium fuel requirement. Braking is excellent. Ride is quite stiff. I needed to replace all four tires at just 18,000 miles. No other maintenance issues.

<TEXT>I just traded my 2007 CX-7 for a 2009 Honda Accord. The worst part is the gas mileage. It didn't get even close to what it was supposed to, even when I put premium in it, it averaged 15 mpg on a really good day. Also, during the last two months in the shop with it 5 times. A valve cracked and leaked twice in one month & I had the same valve replaced twice. The light illuminated a third time & the fuel filler neck had to be replaced. I also replaced all 4 tires at 17,000 miles and was told by Mazda this was "normal." This cost me $800. Not to mention 2 recalls and cheap, boring interior design with crappy leather. Remote start also sucks. So happy with my new car and glad to be rid of the CX7!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My CX-7 has been a huge disappointment. I knew about the gas but did not realize I could ONLY use premium if I did not want the engine to knock. Cheap interior and no temp gauge. Have had it in the shop a lot and now with less than 14000 miles I am having to buy an expensive special order set of tires. No more Mazdas for me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned the CX-7 for about a year. I bought it for the wife as we needed a vehicle to haul the Grandkids around and our 2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse was just not suited for passengers or carseats! The acceleration is stellar ans the handling is supreme! Yes, the gas mileage leaves something to be desired, but overall we are happy with the vehicle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We Traded in our 2007 Madza CX7 GT AWD with 9500 miles on it today. We were sick of the premium gas and the absolutely horrid gas mileage 10-13 mpg around town. We brought it to the dealer 3 times to check the mileage problems and they claimed there was no problem. The car was fun to drive but made us sick when filling up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased the CX7 to get me and my surfboard to the beach on the weekends. It also does the Costco and Home Depot runs. Since the car was for utility only it is basically stripped. I added a Pioneer in-dash nav unit with an iPod connection to control it through the nav unit. Works great looks ok too. Since the car is stripped, it does not have the outside temp. Should be standard like other Ford products. The car is fun to drive compared with other SUVs. It feels very car like and sporty. Has decent speed but, if you push it hard, it will kill the gas mileage. I have about 12,000 miles and have had no issues with it. So far, it has only needed oil changes. Tires look like they will go to 25k</TEXT>

Problems range from parking lights that do not turn off to windows that will not work. The car has a stiff ride, poor rear visibility, and a cheap looking interior. MPG is horrible averaging about 15. I believe that its sibling, the CX-9, won car of the year for 2007, however the CX-7 is anything but!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I ride a sportbike, I like fun cars since they are a "bad" investment, and I usually buy US cars. Having said that, I love my CX7. It drives like a sports car and if you drive it like that then you will see poor gas mileage and accelerated tire wear. I get 19 mpg in town and until last night saw 21 mpg on the highway. Last night we went to purchase a used Mazda3 for my wife and I set the cruise at 65. With the tach at 2k rpm, I got 24.2 mpg! Very pleased. You need to keep under the power band of 2500 rpm or you will not get over 21 mpg, period. The factory tires are terrible in snow with the low aspect ratio profile. An upgrade to a better all season in the future. US guy converted to Zoom Zoom!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a Mazda 626 that I loved but it was quite the lemon after 70k miles. But I took the chance and purchased the CX-7. It was love a first sight. Love driving this vehicle. I can pass anyone on the road and it is so easy to steer and maneuver through out traffic (Houston traffic!) I do have the check engine light problem but it is due to the gas cap coming loose. That is only a small hiccup to me and doesn't bother me as much as everyone else. It is fixable, not a deal breaker people! The fuel economy is average and a lot better than I thought it would be. I get premium fuel every third tank and the engine is fine. I will be purchasing a newer model in the next few yrs</TEXT>

Took 3 weeks to get fixed then 1 week later power windows don't work correctly. Now has 13000 miles and passenger side front tire is balding on the inside. Dealer told me that this is not uncommon for this vehicle to need new tires by 15000 miles which is not covered by warranty. Have had vehicle for 11 months now and is worth more than $10,000 less than paid for it. Lots of engine noise, you need the Bose stereo.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>2nd review</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>This is my second review. I was allowed to purchase my own company car, and work as a consultant for a manufacturer. I travel throughout the Southeast US, doing exhibits and speaker engagements. I can pack my entire exhibit in my CX-7, and motor to anywhere work takes me. I've put 50,000 on the car in one year. I love it! I might complain about the average of 20.5 to 22 mpg. But, maybe if I slowed down I'd get better mileage. I'll keep the zoom zoom. Really, this car drives like a sports car, has the space of a small suv, and has performed flawlessly first year. I can't wait to see how Mazda improves on this unit in years to come. I will be trading in a couple years you know.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Longtime Mazda owner here. This is the "other" car in the garage and it usually is the vehicle of choice for weekend errands and long trips. This car is unstoppable in snow, pulls a small trailer without breaking a sweat, and can pass on two lane roads with some SERIOUS authority. Tradeoff is mpg (low 20s, best is 24 mpg) and slightly performance oriented ride/handling. The OEM tires are very stiff and, when replaced with OEM Ford Edge Continentals, absolutely transform this into a first class ride. Would definitely buy a CX7 again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>With gas prices the way they are, this is not the car if you plan to complain about the mileage. However, if you like something fun to drive, looks good on the road, and can speed up really quick then this is your car. When the dealer told me it had only a 4 banger I laughed and said I wanted something with more of an engine then I test drove it. It didn't remind me of no 4 banger I had driven before. I like the car a lot and like the performance. It is a fun car to drive. I love opening the roof and the windows.

<TEXT>I think this car is awesome. It really caters to the driver. While the mileage is not great, I give it high marks because I am easily getting the mileage advertised, if not a bit better, about 19 city and 24-25 highway. The Bose system is wonderful, controls for it and all of the comfort features are easy to understand and use. Storage is great - the glove compartment is huge, as is the space under the armrest. I can fit my laptop in there when needed. Flip down seats in the cargo area are a great idea, and the auto button to fold them down is a real convenience. Moonroof is nice and getting a lot of use from me. The ride is excellent with no rattles or hums. Great pickup for a 4-cylinder.</TEXT>

Have had it in the shop several times for stupid problems like wheels locking up while driving, windows not working, and the passenger side airbag light staying on (meaning the airbag is off) even when an adult is in the seat. Gas mileage is atrocious for a 4 cylinder. I don't have an issue with 18 mpg, but a 4 cylinder... let's be serious, especially with premium gas. Sticker on the car said 24 mpg on the highway, obviously they meant a downhill highway when you are driving with a fierce tailwind. Seats are incredibly uncomfortable & terrible resale value.

I wanted a vehicle with good ground clearance for Houston rains, easy in and out, and good handling. I like the gauges which are well lit, day and night. It handles well, and have done some sport car racing in the past. The fuel mileage could be better, I get 22 mpg overall country/Houston driving, and up to 26 mpg on the interstate trips. I would like to use regular gas like the 2008 model allows. It is a great car for old guys & young too. The leg room & power seat is what sold it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my CX-7 in April of 2007. I absolutely love this vehicle. It is fun to drive, comfortable, and I get pretty "decent" gas milage. I live in Texas, so the summer did persuade me to have the windows tinted as it was a roasting oven. Others on the road do not realize the acceleration, handling capabilities, and speed that it has as a Turbo injected vehicle. I love it. I look forward to purchasing the CX-9 late this year too. The one issue that I am having with it is the clicking noise during "hard" accelerations. I was told it was because I was using mid-grade gas. Since switching to high-grade, I occasionally get the noise, mostly when over 95 degree outside. </TEXT>

It fits our daughter and everything that goes along with her perfectly. I'm glad we popped for the GT but I wish I'd spent a tad more for the nav system.

<TEXT>This really is an awesome car! I test drove almost all other SUVs on market like it, and the CX-7 was my favorite. So MPG isn't great, but for the SUVs on the market today, I am not surprised. The Mazda CX-7 is fun to drive and the performance is great. I sold my old Lexus GS-300 (I'll admit it was the first model made back in the 90s) and bought this car, and I am not disappointed in the performance or the handling. The AWD is a must for snow conditions and traction control is a nice feature. Had to get 3 recalls done, but I got a letter in the mail telling me I needed to, and they were paid for. Never had a problem with reliability. Great car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove many automatic cars and SUVs (including the Nissan Murano) with V6 engines and so far the CX7 had the best acceleration (like a car with a manual stick shift). The exterior looks great very similar to the Lexus. This car works well for a family of three, or four at the most due to the limited cargo space when traveling. I had a couple of flat tires but could have been bad luck also. Otherwise runs smoothly with no serious problems. Great buy for this price except for gas mileage!</TEXT>

I have complained about this, and they told me when I hit 10k I would get better mpg then they told me after 12k now it's after 15k. It takes premium fuel which adds up fast! It has a very rough ride, does not have comfortable seats for long ride, does not handle that well in snow, mine is AWD, and I have a problem with the doors locking and unlocking by themselves and the horn randomly honking.

<TEXT>After having narrowed the choices to an Acura RDX or a Mazda CX-7, I am very pleased to say that after 6 months and 23k miles, the CX-7 was definitely the choice for me. With its more agressive and sleek exterior design, partnered with a handsome and roomy interior, the CX-7 definitely has the aesthetic advantage to every other crossovers in its class. The turbo-charged engine provides excellent acceleration, with no problems passing on the highway. The agile handling and precise braking on the most curvaceous suburban roads make for an excellent and fun drive, almost making you forget you're driving a crossover.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design (especially on the GT trim) is stylish, and the controls are well laid-out and simple. There are no abundance of buttons and gadgets that complicate the center cosole, making it very easy to use. Bose sound system great. Handling and acceleration is top notch. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The CX7 is a blast to drive, when it is running at least, but the driving experience can blind you to a cheap interior, a technology package that is woefully deficient, and a general feeling that the vehicle is not built with the quality it should be. Most of all, after 4 CEL problems and multiple experiences when the vehicle simply does not run, I believe the CX7 has some real engineering deficiencies. Run, don't walk, away from the Mazda dealership and do not get sucked in by the initial driving enjoyment. You are likely to face real problems down the road.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The mainstay of this car is how it handles and stops. It drives like more of a car than any of the competitors in this segment. If you are looking for something a little more roomy than car but dread the blah design of some cross overs or mini-vans, this is a great alternative. The turbo is responsive and acceleration is swift, but could be better. Upshifts under full throttle hold on a little too long past the powerband. If you have a heavy foot, you will pay at the pump. Driving this car in a fun manner will push mileage down close to 15 MPG. If you drive normal, however, the stated 18 MPG in the city is realistic. On the highway, it has returned about 23 MPG. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Bose stereo is great. I opted out of the tech package so that I could integrate and iPod cradle and video feed for LCDs in the headrest. No need for DVDs! The interior build is great, the trunk is spacious, and it definitely has the heart of a sport car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Mazda. I purchased it because it is a very nice looking vehicle and it fits my family, which includes three in car seats. After purchasing the CX-7 I noticed several things that have slightly reduced my opinion of the vehicle. The fuel economy is not very good and premium fuel is required. From the interior the engine noise and heat is very noticible. The transmission shifts oddly back and forth between fifth and sixth gear at times. Suspension is very stiff. Turbo lag. Many "nice to haves" missing - no bluetooth, no navigation software support between Mazda and Navteq, no extra functions such as MPG in the display, no iPod ability with nav. sys., etc. A-pillar blind spot!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the best handling SUV that you can buy. In fact it handles much better than most cars. For example it handles better than an Acura TSX. We average over 21 MPG in town that includes some freeway driving. We have taken one trip--over 1000 miles and we averaged 25 MPG. Even though the engine is not a smooth and quiet as a V/6, it performs better that any of the V/6's that we drove. We found that the handling on most Toyota SUVs was very sloppy and while the Acura MDX did handle and drive well, The CX-7 looks so much better and costs about $10,000 less(I'm talking about what you can actually buy one for). The Acura is nicer inside but the build quality on the CX-9 is just as good.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The factory 18 inch wheels look better than any of the competitors. They complement an already great looking car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Update to my orig post. After nearly a year of ownership, I still love my CX7! I've had it all over So.Cal from Yosemite to Mammoth to Big Bear. All my original impressions remain. The AWD works well in snow and rain and the combination of traction control and the excellent ABS brakes provide plenty of security on iffy roads. My only complaint is still that of fuel mileage. I am averaging 15.5mpg around town but on a long trip to Tahoe I managed 22mpg @ avg speed of 75mph. Very respectable. The turbo shines on mountain roads, lotsa scoot! It is important to note whether you have the AWD or FWD model, I suspect that has a lot to do with the large delta in mileage reported here.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ext & Int Design. Solid Build. Turbo scoot with taut, communicative handling. Confidence inspiring grip of AWD, TC and world class brakes! Tech package a terrific addition if you can swing it. Keyless ignition, adjustable Xenon headlamps a nice touch.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>From the outside it is beatiful. The inside is not bad. When driving on the highway its smooth but if you drive slow it makes a ticking noise, drives me crazy.I asked the dealer and was told that its normal.He explained why but I still think it should run smoother.I can't wait until I can exchange it. I am not so happy with it even though this is the first time a buy a new car. I think the noise should be a lot smoother than it is. I took to the dealer and I had them listen to it and they said it was normal. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had the privledge of selecting the type of car purchased by my employer. Crossovers were my choice of vehicle type, so the choice was between the Honda CR-V, Madza CX-7, or Nissan Murano price range. Test driving all three was fun, but I found that the Mazda had more sports car like characteristics than the others. I am a consultant, and often drive 400 mile trips in a given day, with meetings. The car is awesome for such trips. I arrive in comfort, refreshed, and ready to consult. Glad I picked the CX-7. Almost feel guilty sometimes, most people in my profession drive pickups. Enjoy my Zoom Zoom Zoom Mazda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've purchased my Madza CX-7 three months ago and the transmission and tire warning lights came on three times already. You wouldn't think warning lights will come up this soon after a new car purchase. Yet again, I need to take it back to the dealership for a check-up.

<TEXT>I absolutely love my new CX-7. I have had it for 6 months and have no regrets about purchasing it. I previously had a RAV-4 and it pales in comparison. The CX-7 is sporty and stylish and I get compliments on it on a daily basis. When you need to get up and go in traffic, it is ready. The navigation is great, the Bose surround sound is great, and the overall interior is great. I love the color of the interior orange and blue lights at night. I think this is the first vehicle I will keep for a while. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my CX-7 in March and so far so good. It is my first SUV and the driving experience is fun. Body roll is car-like and breaking is excellent. I am averaging around 20 MPG. No issue with storage. The cargo cover is a nice feature especially this time of year. The stereo system is solid as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I find myself begging the wife for the driver seat every time we get in the car. The responsive handling is what I like the most compared to the sluggish Toyota we had before. The Tiptronics feels and acts kinda like a BMW, firm and in control. Cornering is especially reassuring. I hardly need to press brakes on curvy mountain roads. The build interior and exterior feels solid. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Compared the Ford Edge, FX35, decided to go with an unknown being this is my first Mazda. Had for 10 months and 12,000 miles. Like the seats, interior, brakes, tranny, navi and sound system. Just the right size too. But still can't get used to the 4 cyl turbo and lag. Engine is very noisy when cold. Really miss a silky smooth V6 and this ain't it. Mileage avg only 20. Lots of corners cut on int & ext plastic. No trip computer - surprised for a GT. You call that carpet on the inside, looks more like spray on. Overall pleased and would recommend.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior size is just right. Comfy for a guy 6'3". Navi and sound system. Suspension is nice and firm - I like that. Tight steering and brakes. The fold down back seats work well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Our CX-7 Goes to the Ozarks - October, 2007 Our first vacation in more than eighteen months was also our first significant road trip in the CX-7. We were both curious as to how the little XUV would serve as a constant companion for a week. I won?t belabor the point, but the comfort, performance, handling and utility of our baby was remarkable! She proved to be the best travel vehicle we?ve ever owned. This was a seven-day trip that took us from the flat Red River Delta of Northwest Louisiana to the magnificent Ozark Mountains of Northern Arkansas. We encountered rain, high winds and extreme temperature swings.Through it all, CX-7 Sport never failed. Never.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Was so excited when I got a great deal on this car. I have been disappointed on the performance since that day. I am averaging 15-16 miles per gallon, and It takes premium gas!! Ouch!! The car feels like it's trying too hard all the time. The transmission light has come on twice now, and they are upgrading a computer as I write this review. Let's see what happens. Also no outside temperature on the Sport model. What's with that??</TEXT>

<TEXT>Until I test drove the CX-7, I had no idea this car existed. After that, there was no turning back! I absolutely love this car! I'm a person who on the average buys a car every 2-3 years, this is by far my favorite! I just can't say enough about it and/or Mazda! If it wasn't for my Dad loving his Miata so much, I would have never walked into the Mazda dealer! This crossover does not feel like a 4 cyl, not with the turbo. The drive is amazing, the braking is smooth and the handling is fabulous! Overall it's a lot of fun to drive and the perfect car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior looks, the Bose sound system w/6 cd, leather heated seats, interior lighting, Xenon headlights (very cool), factory Installed satellite radio, exterior looks like I paid a lot more for the car (very sleek). All my friends and family LOVE this car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Being a sports car kinda girl coming from driving a van, I really wanted a car that could give me both. I had to have cargo room. So I went looking for something to give me both. I thought I had settled on the Murano until I saw the CX-7 then drove it. I love this car! I love the way it looks and I love the way it drives. It really gives the feeling of a sports car.Two of my friends have since purchased their own after driving mine!! Who could blame them!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The front view looks so sporty I love the width and shape. It looks like a panther (I have the black clearcoat). I love the way it drives. The turbo is just what I like. I don't care to spend more on gas to have that. Great cargo. Also I love the 18 inch wheels. Overall this car is smokin!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>For the price you really can't get a better car. It drives like a 3 series. Has everything but nav, you get everything pretty much standard even on base trim. You cannot even compare the CR-V to this car, but if you are keeping a car 10+ years maybe the honda is the better choice. Only complaint I have is that it's now on its 7th recall, but Mazda has been great and always puts me in a CX-7 loaner.</TEXT>
