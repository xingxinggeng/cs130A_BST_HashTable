<TEXT>Worst Car I've Ever Owned. Although the car is a head turner, I am anxiously counting the days until my lease is over and I can turn this horrible car back to the dealership. German suspensions are wonderful for flawless German roads, but unfortunately, the suspension is way, way too stiff for flawed American roads. The ride is HORRIBLE. I feel every bump in the road. The seats are poorly padded and after a half hour in the car I am ready to get out of it ASAP. Sadly, I took it from Washington DC to New York and by the time I got to my destination I wanted to leave it on the side of the road. That was the last road trip for it, now only use it because it is small and easy to park.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car, love the styling; straight-six sounds great and the manual gearbox is super-smooth. Love the seating position, as well as the interior space with the easy-folding top up. Very nice to drive, the car is very communicative and gives you lots of confidence, brakes are amazing and stop the car with little drama. My only complaint is with the interior build-quality. The one-piece door panels are great, but the steering column is tilted, a cup holder is broken (I don't even use them) and the transmission tunnel plastic trim squeaks when you rest your arm on it. Besides that, everything you touch is of high-quality and just driving it takes your mind off its few squabbles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sport button that lessens the assist for the steering and allows for great road feel as well as a more sensitive throttle. 50.1/49.9 weight distribution. Revolutionary design and classic roadster proportions.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my Z4 coupe 15 months and have 17,700 miles on it. First car I have "loved"! I'm 65 and behind the wheel, I feel like 25. I have driven just about all sport cars, but none have turned me on, like my coupe. I drove a Porsche on a race track once, but this coupe will beat that Porsche on any curve anytime. And I might add, for half the price. The Z4 coupe is and will be the only car for me. When I'm too old to drive, I'll sit in my rocker, rock the day away, while looking at my Z.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1. The look of the car. 2. The feel of the car. 3. The way the car responds to me.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Retired &amp; loving it</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I bought this car as a retirement present present to myself (curiously, I see a lot of guys (mostly) my age driving these cars!). I have thoroughly enjoyed driving for short hops. I have taken 3 trips of 500 miles and this is not the car for it. The RFTs amplify the bumps on bad roads, and we all know what I-95 can be like. Other than that, it is so much fun to drive and cornering is a terrific experience. I have the 6-speed manual and wouldn't consider the automatic - that would just be wrong in a sports car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auto top, especially being able to lower it with the key fob - what a hit that has been at the senior center!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When the Z4 came out to replace the Z3, I thought they ruined the idea. It's a much different car and when you drive it, you can forget about the Z3. The lines on the car all seem to fit and have purpose, even though I'm not a fan of the Bangle designs. I bought the Z4 3.0si convertible which is a fast car and looks unbelievable with the sport package and 18" wheels. The sport package completely changes the look and driving of the car, it's a must. It's fast enough even with the auto trans which has the paddle shifters. The extended leather and premium M seats are a must too. All the options raise the price, but if you're seriously considering this car, cost is not a concern. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Just about everything on the car really. The lines of the design are great. People stare at the car as if it cost twice what it did. Out performs 95% of the cars you'll pass. Interior makes the most out of the space the car has, quiet even at 75 with the top down. The Sport package is a must!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Nothing like completely changing a day as to hop into the Z and spring off into the night. Incredible driving experience and am lucky to have many windy roads to enjoy. Fun, fun, fun!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Z4 for pleasure driving only (sunshine time). This was to replace my previous convertible of 5 years that I sold last year. After test driving numerous cars, once I sat in the Z4 I knew this was one for me. It amazes me every time I take it out for a drive! Usually there is a limit that a car can handle in driving performance but I still can't find it with this Z4. It's like "I can take that, I dare you to go farther!" Needless to say, this is a car that can get you in trouble. BMW really knows how to design and build an exceptional convertible. They have mastered what it takes to create an unparalleled driving experience. I am impressed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Euphoric! Exterior/interior design; Bluetooth; size (good for small people); performance; braking, acceleration and handling; safety; runflat tires, rollover protection, airbags, 4*/5* BMW assist; premium stereo; extended leather, maintenance program, automatic top, heated and memory seats, fast. ;)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased mine certified used with 11000 miles on it. Very fun to drive! Looks fast, is fast. I rarely used to put the windows down in my old cars, but with this car I put the windows and top down every chance I get! I get many compliments on it--it is simply a sharp looking car and turns plenty of heads. I love how Z4s are not as widely popular as, say, a 3-series and that was a big reason why I purchased mine. If you're looking to buy, seriously consider the metallic silver color with premium package. With the sharp angles of the body styling, silver looks beautiful!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great sound system, high mileage (25 in city!), low and smooth engine tone, smooth shifting, consistent acceleration from 0-90mph, responsive handling, killer body styling, and it is fun to drive!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wow, I compared this vehicle head-to- head with Porsche Boxter & new Audi TT. The classic design along with BMW safety and technology won me over hands down. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Besides the styling, simple to use hands-free Bluetooth, awesome leather, acceleration that pulls effortlessly, I feel very safe.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is by far the best vehicle I've ever driven. Simply a blast to drive, even with the ESP on. You'd be hard pressed to find a car that handles better. It inspires confidence going into every corner, and with skin off your face brakes and an unbelievably seamless ESP, even when the most OMG situations come up, you have the brakes and the control to avoid idiot drivers. The suspension is a little bit on the egg-beater side, but it's well within the range of comfortable, without sacrificing real performance. Basically, this car does everything you tell it to, making everything feel really easy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Actually getting over 20 MPG, real sports car handling, huge trunk (I take it to the supermarket), people staring, perfect shifter, feather clutch, sweet exhaust not, killer sound system, flat torque from 2000-6600 rpm</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the car. Bought it w/sport & premium package - no nav. I feel like I am driving a rocketship stereo with its the THX sound and direct aux for my listening to my iPod. It still has a few minor quirks (like remote door locks - sometimes the passenger side won't unlock w/the remote and have to unlock from the center button), which a car this price should not have. This is the first BMW I have purchased and now understand the obsession. There is no better feeling than putting it into "SD" (automatic trans) and seeing all the other cars left in the dust :)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>THX stereo is out of control and Sport Drive rocks. Heated seats are great b/c they warm up the car and you don't need to put on the master heat (in Cali anyway). Looks - the the coupe shows off the lines, this is the true shape the Z4 (plus the hatch fits a way more than expected).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This review focuses more on the bad... fragile paint (scratches too easily), mostly plastic (can't wax out those scratches), annoying beeper (won't shut up for 1 minute, no chimes!), seat belt can't be adjusted (irritates neck), runflat tires sensitive (added air twice in 4 months), 6 speed manual doesn't shift smoothly, doesn't hold value (depreciated $13K < 4 months, so I'm stuck!), steering keeps driver way too active, ride quality on rough roads is unacceptable (feel every imperfection!), noisy with roof up, rattles. BMW engineers have ruined this car! Our 2003 Z4 was superior! Yep, I have high standards, especially when I pay $47K+ for a new BMW!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Brake hold, speed sensitive volume control.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was initially hesitant about buying a roadster, but after owning this for two months I wished I had purchase this sooner. Make sure you get the stick shift because that's half the fun. Also get the sports pkg with the sports mode and upgraded wheels. The sports mode provides livelier accel and steering. When driving the Z, the car is truly one with the driver (me). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>THX certiifed stereo, sports package wheels (very cool), power roof, iPod adapter thru the steering wheel (option well worth the cost), good-size trunk, stick shift.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted a little excitement in my life and this car really does the trick. It's so much fun to drive, I hate to get out of it. I leased the 3.0 convertible w/automatic trans and premium pkg. Punch this baby and you're on a roll. This car turns heads everywhere I go. It looks fast, it is fast, and it sticks to the road like glue.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great stereo, great acceleration and the MPG is outstanding at 26+. I love being able to put the top up/ or down in 20 seconds. It's a rocket on a roller skate. Also a little secret - no maintenance costs for 4 years/50K miles!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Started with a 2.3 Z3, moved to 3.0 Z3 and now 3.0si Z4. This is the best one so far. Took me a few years to warm to the styling but now suddenly it clicked. The chassis is exceptionally stiff - as stiff as the Z3 coupe was. Makes a huge difference. The car feels of one piece and there are no rattles or creaks. Huge storage space in the trunk (for a 2 seater), excellent gas mileage, very powerful engine. A pleasure to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hill holder. This feature needs to be standard in all manuals. It's THE feature that helped my wife get comfortable with driving a stick-shift. Now she loves to drive the car. The one-touch button for top operation is great. Fast and easy. Glass rear window. Extended leather!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A good 2nd car for fun in the sun, with great looks and handling, but not a suitable replacement for my 2000 540i. The wind noise on the highway and comfort on bumpy roads is not very good, so consider this for daily travel. More of a weekend "lets have fun" car. Personally I think our 2003 Z4's 5-speed shifted smoother and quicker and its ride was not so harsh (as I recall), so I'm a bit disappointed by this 2007 Z4. The 6-speed shifting bothers me the most, since I do a lot of it! (Oh well.) </TEXT>

<TEXT>The car does what you'd expect... great acceleration, exhaust note, handling. When driven with the top up on those not-so-perfect days, there are a few rattles in the roof/seats. It's not as fast as a Vette off the line, but the seats are exceptionally comfortable, the THX stereo sounds awesome, and the nimble handling make it all worth while in the end. However, if you plan to do most of your driving with the top up or in the winter months don't bother!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased a 2007 BMW Z4 3.0si to use as a daily driver, as my wife drives our 2006 Land Cruiser. It did not take long to realize that this car is for weekends only! It is cramped and the ride over older roads will knock fillings out of your mouth! That said, it is a great sports car. The handling, transmission, and power are great. It is an absolutlely fun car in the cool of the morning or for a romantic drive in the evening, but it is not intended to replace a sedan. I am taking the penalty to get the 2008 535i!</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a fun car to drive. Get heated seats no matter where you live. Great feeling when top is down. Get the M seats. The Nav is great today ties in to radio and phone and great maps. Double click remote and you can put top down before entering car. Get the prem package and sport package. Get Xenon lights and hard top prep. Sport button is awesome great driving stability control sytem. Entended leather is awsome. Wanted automatic transmission thus the 3.0si. 265 HP plenty but if you just want manual and 355 HP go for M. It's a fun fun fun car. 0 to 60 in 6 secs. Fast rides great feels great. Heads turn when they see. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a definite good buy. I have leased this 2006 BMW Z4 3.0i and so far I have been satisfied. The overall perfomance is great but one thing I would rather have is front wheel drive instead of rear because it affects driving in rain. Since I live in Las Vegas the rain is not an often issue, but when it actually rains I have to watch out and drive carefully on turns. Gas mileage is rather typical for 3.0. Interior design is not what I have expected and this is my biggest disappointment. It really looks cheap maybe because I am used to Audi's unusual design but still this is not so good for a BMW.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Definite best part about this car is its overall exterior design. The way it sits low adds a certain look to it and it makes it more sexy.</FAVORITE>
