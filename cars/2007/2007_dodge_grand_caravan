<TEXT>We bought the van used with 24k miles on it, now have 41k on it. My wife loves the van and we both love the stow and go seating. The versatility of a pick-up in a van. Just finished 1,200 mile trip with no problems. MPG: 16 city, 24 highway. The van has been in the shop a few times for warranty issues. The torque converter has been replaced, the transmission was flashed with new software, brakes and tires @30k, clunking front suspension, both power doors failing to open. The van should be more reliable, but what can one expect from an American car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We love our van because it's easy to use with kids. That's where it ends. It's been in the shop twice for a leaking transmission - the rubber the window on the drivers side falls of if you shut the door too hard. The remote start doesn't work, the transmission clunks when downshifting, the tires are terrible, there isn't enough power and the wing mirrors are fading. We have a total of 14,000 miles now - Not impressed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power doors, 7 seats and stow and go.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have had 3 Dodge Grand Caravans will never have another. We dealt with Chrysler on problems and they never repaired or fixed them. We traded and still had a problem. The last Caravan we had, the transmission went out at 49000 miles and then we had two more transmissions put in still had problems. We are done with Dodge, Chrysler, etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought van used from local dealer. Great roominess with seats stored. Handles good even on winter roads which surprised me considering it doesn't have traction control. Like exterior styling but could use a little chrome. Front brake pads squeal even after being replaced. Mileage is good for a van. Comfortable even on longer trips. Would recommend it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior room for hauling/camping. Exterior style. Comfortable and fun to drive for a van.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have had problems since 500 miles. There is a terrible problem with the trans and engine! We bought because of the price and 7 seats. No way can you fit 3 car seats in the back row. We are done with the lemon law now. Thank goodness! It was in the shop every month for at least 2 days. Most times 5 to 7 days while they put new parts on. They pushed us around and kept telling us nothing was wrong, but there was. Broke down completely 3 times and had to be towed! Please don't put your family in danger with this car. My friend bought an 08 and just finished her lemon law as well. Too bad this couldn't have been better was nice to be able to take all the kids in one car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our 2007 Grand Caravan SXT used without 23,000 miles on it. We had been shopping for a minivan for a few months. We wanted a Honda/Toyota, but for the price of a 4 year old Honda/Toyota we were able to few months old Grand Caravan. We are very happy with the van. Tons of cargo space, the kids fit in perfectly and the wife likes driving it. The build quality is lacking, but you can't not expect all that much from an American car company anyway. Some interior parts feel very cheap. The transmission thunks and jumps at low speeds. Gas mileage is 16 city (very hilly) and 27 highway. Not too bad for a truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stow-and-go seating is massive for us. The van is very drivable over long distances. Rear A/C is very nice and powerful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have owned this van for about 16 months and put about 18000 miles on it. Needed service once for a rusted brake line for ABS (ABS light came on and stayed on). Has been dependable and very versatile. The convenience and ease of stow and go seating is great, as is the power lift gate. The remote start is a must for me in the winter. Gas mileage is just OK, not horrible at 20-21 mpg mixed city and highway driving after employing gas saving driving tips (set your cruise control at 60 mph on the highway (city speed limit) and watch other cars pass you like you are standing still!), got 18mpg consistently before that. Transmission "thunks" downshifting, jerking the van, not at all smooth. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd. Chryco Minivan. Utility and Value punctuate my ownership experiences. For $12,300 I purchased a year old Dodge Grand Caravan SE with stow and go seating with only 10,747 miles. The vehicle is Chrysler Certified so the power train is warranted for 8 yr/80K miles and I have a bumper to bumper warranty for 39 months/39K miles. "Certified" also includes roadside assistance till 8 yr/80K. AND the dealer threw in free lifetime oil changes. WOW! With a little luck the transmission will make it 100K miles and she wont rust out till it's 9th year in service. Maybe even the AC/Heater core will make it 5+ years. If I can get 30K between brake jobs I'll be happy! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stow and Go seating. HUGE cargo space. Towing ability. We race motorcycles offroad and downhill ski and this IS the best vehicle for the task.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> Love my van, mpg could be better love stow and go, hard to use unless you have the seats all the way forward, vibrating at around 30 to 35 bothers me, never can seem to get it fixed, will keep after them. I didn't like how the muffler side pipe shows so I put on custom running boards to hide them, looks great. I am impressed with the power accels great. Should have a built in antenna. Not good in a car wash, had to replace my antenna already, only had it two months. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The wife and I hit the dealership the last day of the "national mini-van" sale and got an amazing deal. We bought the SXT "special edition" grand caravan for 23 thousand (a 32 thousand dollar vehicle). It has all the bells and whistles they offer. The wife was happy as she drives it to work. We owned a 2002 Grand Caravan that we traded in for this one. I have to say the 2002 was more quiet and had more headroom than this 2007. I believe it's because of the stow 'n go seating storage bins being so close to the road it picks up a lot of noise (?). The wife likes it so I'm happy, no issues with it thus far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the Van for almost a year now. Can't beat the storage (sto n go). It is Awesome. I think it looks better than the new style. Yeah it's a minivan but if you put your ego aside then it is the most versatile vehicle out there. My 3 kids love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It has been reliable. Gas mileage is reasonable for a vehicle this size, especially if you go easy on the throttle. Excels at carrying people and stuff.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The comfort of the vehicle leaves alot to be desired. The automatic doors sometimes dont work as they should. With a 3.8 L engine the drive could handle a little bit better. The fuel eff. is good and I like the "Stow-n- Go" seating.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased the Grand Caravan SXT used (Program Vehicle) in late December 2007. We needed a 7 passenger vehicle to accommodate our children and grandchildren and this one fit the bill. It gets slightly better gas mileage than the 2002 Ford Windstar it replace (averaging 18.3 to 22.3 mpg). The Caravan has less interior room (Body width appears narrower) than the Windstar. The back bench seat will not fit 3 passengers if you put a child or infant's car seat in the designated middle position.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this van for space for family. Though I'm happy with the space, I was highly disappointed with several features (or lack of features). Stutters and jumps when traveling slow speeds (like in a parking lot). The climate control is horrible. No way to switch between heat and air-you just have to adjust the temp up and down one degree at a time in three different places. No way to turn on just the fan, cool temp means air conditioning. I paid over $500 for remote start but wasn't told the stinkin' thing shuts off in 10 minutes--what's the point of that? Console did not close or lock--9 weeks later still not fixed. Mileage only 15- 16 mpg whether in town or on highway. Don't like anything else except the space. Will never buy a Dodge van again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We already have a 14 month old child and now my wife is expecting twins, so we needed a vehicle that could fit our growing family comfortably. Our biggest problem was finding a vehicle that could fit three car seats along with everything else a growing family demands. The grand caravan won by default with the great combination of price, comfort and 0% financing. We chose the leather seats and purchased a dual dvd player from Walmart.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This large step in purchasing a "Man- Van" was the result of our third child coming into this world. It replaced a 2003 Ford Taurus. I like the sporty exterior look, if you can say that about a mini-van. The interior is OK, but we did not opt for the leather seats so its what we paid for. We did get the "Stow-n-Go" seats which are great! My wife drives this primarily as I drive a Hemi Durango. For long trips I prefer the Durango for a couple reasons: It can get out of its own way on the highway, and gets better gas mileage with the MDS. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our 2007 Grand Caravan SXT about a week ago and have been looking for an excuse to drive it ever since. This was our first minivan.I never thought I would be the minivan type but I have to admit I love it. My wife is expecting twins and we needed the extra space. I know the vans from Honda and Toyota get better reviews in many circles, but for the price you can't beat the Grand Caravan. The exterior design is really sharp. We have power side doors and tailgate. What a convenience!. You can open and close all 3 with a touch of a button. The inside is even better. There is a ton of room with all kinds of storage. It handles very well with good pickup. The visability of the road is great!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stow-n-go is second to none. It is really easy to use, and with numerous options for any size load. When the seats are up you get two huge storage bins below. The removable center console has a holder for a cell phone, pen, tissues. It also has a storage compartment with a light. Very handy!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We traded in our SUV for this Dodge Caravan, and was impressed by the room in this vehicle. The "Stow and Go" feature is incredible, this vehicle can go to family van to cargo van in the blink of an eye. There is some road noise with this vehicle, that bothers my wife, but not me. The stock stereo is pretty good for what we use it for. The radio controls are on the steering wheel, and the seats are comfortable. We are happy that we chose the Grand Caravan SXT, as our family is growing, and we love to take road trips. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded in our GMC Envoy for a Grand Caravan, and we were surprised! The room in this van is ridiculous! All of the seats recline, and the stow and go feature provides mega room for diaper bags and groceries! I think that this is the best van for the money! We looked at the Honda Odyssey, and the Grand Caravan was the better vehicle! I think that SUV drivers with kids will be happy when they try this van!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was very surprised by the overall quality of the van, from the ride quality, to the features, to the fit and finish. A quick look at 'expert' reviews shows Toyota and Honda all by themselves. But for my family, we appreciated the value of the Dodge without paying near luxury-car prices. Seems more spacious than the Kia we drove, and while I'd like a little more HP, the price makes it worthwhile. Incredibly well designed interior.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an exceptional car. We bought the van to replace a Durango. The van has significantly more room inside, and is easier to get in and out of, especially to the 3rd row. The DVD system is great! For people with young kids this is well worth the price.The stow and go is very nice. I was very surprised how big the storage area is. So far I am a little disapointed in the fuel economy, but it will probably get better after it is broken in. The van is very comfortable to drive, and all of the controls are laid out very logical. My only regret so far is not buying it sooner!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6 disk DVD system. I have 3 kids between the ages of 7 and 11. This makes driving much quieter! I also like the power doors and hatch, integrating the remote into the key is also a nice improvement over the old key fobs.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle has been impressive so far. I received the minivan as a company car. My hopes weren't high due to the bad press about Chrysler models. Generally, I'm a Honda fan but this vehicle is as well made as our Pilot. The ride quality is superb, the stow and go seating is class leading (love the extra storage room when middle seats are up), and the driver's captain's chair has proven comfortably ideal for both high mileage and in and around town trips. Honda and especially Toyota are high priced and unwilling to negotiate while Chrysler offers great deals. It's no wonder the Caravan is the best selling minivan in the US. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My Dodge number 4. This is the best so far. Smooth power, almost all curves where I drive no problems steering is tops. Mileage is a little low at 22 but only 670 miles so far. Should give 24. All other Dodge vans did. Build quality has improved greatly. Can't say enough about stow and go. Can carry full 4x8 sheet plywood inside with hatch closed. Most pickups need tailgate down. Can also haul 10/12 bales of hay. Cruise on interstate is pure joy. 3.8 engine, auto transmission</TEXT>

<TEXT>We looked at this after testing out all sorts of other vehicles. It's a lot more fun to drive than the Sienna, though it's slightly slower in acceleration, because it handles turns much better and feels more connected and in control. We were going to get a crossover but this had better mileage and a lot more space and better features - and better, more nimble cornering than most.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It may be a bit early to tell, but I just bought the 2007 Grand Caravan SXT and so far I really like it. You can feel how well she handles and the engine runs smooth and quiet. The stow and go feature has already paid off and my kids think the brilliant black pearl color I chose is "hot". So far the gas mileage is proving to be a thousand times better than my old 1996 Chrysler Town and Country. That van ate through gas like termites on a toothpick. I hope this van keeps up the performance because so far it's been a good buy.</TEXT>
