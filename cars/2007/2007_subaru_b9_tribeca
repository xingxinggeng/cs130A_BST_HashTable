<TEXT>We got this car with 580000 miles on it. We have had three other subies and loved them all. Our son loves it and calls it the spaceship car (he is five years old ); we travel often and love this car. We had a chevy uplander before and it was JUNK and not four wheel drive. I highly recommend this car to anyone and know a lot of people that have them and love them.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's been a year since I wrote a review on my B7 Tribeca. It now has roughly 21,000 miles and I'm still very glad I purchased it. My wife loved driving it in the snow this past winter. Only minor complaints are 1. I have to stay on top of the service mgr at the dealership when it's in...which fortunately isn't often, and 2. rusty brake calipers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The editors review indicated less than good acceleration for the B9 Tribeca and I must say I disagree strongly. My B9 has great acceleration entering and on the highway. It will jump out from under you if you require it. Super highway car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort and cabin space. My wife and I w/ our 2 yorkies travel a lot and the car is super comfortable with lots of space.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Before I bought this car I read lots of negative things about exterior design in on-line reviews. Honestly, I believe its high tech exterior looks much better than the 2008 model and is totally different from other SUVs. I love it. Interior is amazing and built of excellent material. Driving is smooth as luxury sedan, compare to many other SUVs such as Murano that gives you the impression of driving a truck rather than a car. Car is stable and powerful. Like other SUVs, It is not good on gas. I enjoy driving it very much so far and everybody loves it. I couldn?t find people who hate the design yet and I am still looking for! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior and interior design is excellent. Even the basic model has many features that you may see in limited edition of competitions. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in a late model Nissan and bought a year-old Tribeca with 9,000 miles on it. This vehicle is a "diamond in the rough". An unbelievable value for what I got. The Limited trim line with the mesh grille and big chrome wheels really set this vehicle apart from the rest of the pack. Overall fit and finish is sexy and superb. Excellent handling and responsive boxer 6 cyl engine give a sense of confidence. This is the first Subaru I have owned, but have family members who've owned several Outbacks and a Legacy GT and I can see why they rave about this often over- looked brand! I wonder what Subaru's service dept is like -- hopefully better than Nissan's!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We absolutely luv to drive our Tribeca. Have taken on two long trips and will not give up the wheel. Visually styling is distinct and pleasing. Interior cockpit feels young and vibrant. Exterior side and rear view especially is downright cool. No issues thus far in 16K miles except Nav system freeze up, but replaced immediatly. Mechanically sound as Lexus or Acura.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the looks and the design the best. Drive is nice on highway, but bumpy on urban streets. I have had a lot of rattles and they appear to be with the rear seat and the rear hatch. Dealer can't seem to get it right. Otherwise all of the features of the car are great! Would be very happy but for the bumps and rattles. Subaru should offer standard features on certain trim levels. When buying this car it seems like I could never find the same model with the exactly the same features twice. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2003 Legacy Outback Limited for the Tribeca as soon as it came off the production line. It is so much fun to drive. It is also my very first automatic! I wasn't sure I would like an automatic, so I decided to lease it. Well, here it is almost three years later, and I am still smitten. I was so disappointed when they changed the front in the 2008 model. That is what made it so unique. And, that is why I will most likely purchase this at lease end. I am going to check out the new Forester, and then make my final decision. I am looking for a car to own for the next 10 years. Every time we have to climb a steep hill in the snow, we sing the Spiderman theme. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Researched and drove every SUV around (<$35K) and nothing excited me like a Tribeca. Interior is stunning. Used price is unbeatable. Drives just fine despite negative reviews in the media. Alfa Romero inspired front end will grow on you. Created an emotional connection for me that was completely lacking in an explorer/edge/highlander/pilot/crv or virtually anthing else. Also embraced the wisdom of buying used instead of new with 2 young children in the house.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car after totaling my 2003 Honda Element and I couldn't be happier. I have never owned a Subaru before and the Tribeca is the nicest vehicle I have ever owned. I have owned many makes of cars including Audis, Saabs, Volvos, and Volkswagens. This vehicle tops all of them except two of the Volvos. The comfort and performance is great, and the price point for the features was excellent.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Subaru. I had a Ltd Legacy, over 100000 on it and traded it for a fuel efficient Honda Civic. My daughter now owns that with its 109,000 miles and many more to go. The Tribeca is my first sport luxury car. I drove 5 cars that day and once I drove the Tribeca, that was it, I couldn't go back to the others. I never want to rush somewhere, I just want to be in the car and mosey along. Do I mind a stoplight? Not at all. Just turn up the awesome speaker system. I sat in the third row... no problem for me, I'm 5'5".</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very nice SUV. Well designed; very comfortable interior and ride. Exterior look of '07 is an eyecatcher (disappointed Subaru changed '08 exterior - but I guess makes my '07 all the more special). Gas mileage no surprise (good or bad).

<TEXT>We looked and test drove just about every style of SUV. It came down to the new LR2 Land Rover or the Tribeca, the last one we test drove. I've owned Porsche, Corvette, BMW, Acura, Toyota just to name a few. The interior and exterior of the Tribeca have excellent fit and finish. The ride is very stable and secure feeling. The standard and optional features are wonderful. We wanted an SUV that was going to be a keeper for the next 10 years and we found it. The power is satisfying and adequate for normal everday use. The style isn't ugly, its unique and exotic and it didn't take long to grow on us. We wouldn't have been happy with anything else. The new style looks like all the others.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior and exterior styling are very unique. 18 in wheels, rear camera, puddle lights, touch screen nav system, AWD system. All the switches and buttons (no funky knobs or levers to slide or twist), speedo and tach during the day and everything at night. Safety and security. Chip free body cladding.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I suppose I could talk about how slow the car feels, the so-so ride quality, the hard seats, and the subpar audio system (although it does read MP3 discs); but that's been said. I'd like to talk about how this car saved my life. While driving in the winter in Minnesota, doing about 55 mph, the road suddenly changed from plowed to about 9 inches of snow. As the car begins to slide out of control, I give it full left but the steering is unresponsive, as are the brakes. As I'm about to hit a parked car doing 55, I remember than in an AWD vehicle you must gently apply gas to recover. Voila. AWD saved me from what would have been a horrendous accident. Slow? Who cares.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>TRACTION. And not just tires, but the AWD system, the viscous couplings, the ABS, and everything else that makes this vehicle so perfect for treacherous Minnesota winters. The A/C is very powerful and cold, even when it's 95+ degrees outside. Highway cruising (75+) is comfortable and predictable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We ended up buying the Tribeca unexpectedly due to another car being totaled. I've never owned a Subaru, and it wasn't even on the radar when we started shopping, but their $2750 incentive couldn't be beat. With about 2000 miles so far, I am very pleased. What sold me most was the wonderful interior - well-appointed with quality materials and a stylish dash design. Very upscale. The engine isn't as bad as some say. Power, while not thrilling, is certainly adequate. Great highway ride - quiet and smooth. The exterior design really grows on you as well. I probably see 50 Highlanders or Muranos for every Tribeca on the road. I like that it stands out from the SUV crowd. Well done, Subaru. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the interior - stylish, functional and luxurious. Subaru loaded the Tribeca with features that are expensive options on many competitors. Build quality inside and out is excellent. Subaru's AWD system is highly regarded as well. Distinctive exterior styling sets it apart. High safety ratings.</FAVORITE>

This vehicle has everything and more than I could have ever wanted. It drives like a champ especially in the Miami, FL rain. FYI: I would not change the locking system, because if you ever were to go into a canal you don't want those doors locking automatically.</TEXT>

Some don't like the exterior styling, but I think it sets the Tribeca apart from the crowd. We get looks from people walking down the street all the time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall a good car. Not very roomy in back. 3rd row for small children only. Handling ability in snow is fantastic! However, I only have 2200 miles on this car, have had it in the dealer twice replacing the wiper blades and then replaced the whole wiper. The wipers DO NOT clear during snow. There is significant build up on the passenger side especially. To me totally defeats the purpose of having an AWD vehicle if you can't see when you drive the darn thing!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Not as fun to drive as the manual shift Outback. Slow to get going from a stop and noisy engine rev makes it seem like an effort for the car to get going. Compared to my 11 year old Outback which has zippy pick-up with only four cylinders, this six cylinder car has the perfomance of a dinosaur. Nice interior styling though, but everything is electronic, including odometer. Gas hog.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my first Subaru. We got this vehicle because of ist outstanding safety ratings. Only 6k miles so far it's been all good. The front end (exterior) is different, but it grows on you quickly. The interior is just great. Rear seats are on sliders like front seats, it makes for plenty of room even taller people. The AWD and vehicle stability control features make it sure footed in the northern winters. I'd recommend this vehicle to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>One month & 1800 miles after purchase, I am happy with my first SUV. After 2 Legacies in 17 years I had no doubts about Subaru quality. Our lifestyle now said more room so I test drove other brands to see what whistles and bells were out there. It compares very well in that regard. The tight turn radius is a pleasant surprise. The acceleration is there when needed. The ride is a little bit stiffer than our other car (Avalon). I'm getting 21+ MPG in mixed city and freeway driving on regular gas. The instrument panel and controls are easy to get used to. The seats are comfortable. I feel like I'm in a cockpit. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Instant MPG average read-out teaches you how not to waste gas. Remote start is great in these cold Colorado mornings. Puddle lights are a neat touch. The fog light, day running light, headlight combination is great. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT> B9 Tribeca is not getting the fair review as it should properly be compared to other foreign cars. The exterior and interior designs are fairly comparable to the luxury brands of Toyota, Honda and Nissan. You take a look at the safety features of the car you will be surprise its even better than those big 3 imports. I am enjoying my B9 Tribeca in terms of its luxury appointment and the price that I have paid. Try test driving one and compare it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Good, safe vehicle for my wife. Full time AWD, stability control, heated everything...good winter vehicle.

Plus, we LIKE the look of the vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Subaru, and I bought it based on its safety ratings, the recommendations of friends and on my own long-standing perception of Subaru as an Innovator. Nice car, nice looking, but Subaru is falling short on the details. The $2,000 plus 2007 navigation system is shipping with a 2- year old 2005 vintage map CD. The companion audio system doesn't display title/artist/station information from CD player or radio on that big color screen like other cars in its class. It is also loud in the passenger cabin.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's certainly the one of a kind SUV - powerful, solid, luxury & fun to drive. Looking for a premium quality SUV for some time, I was initially interested in ACURA RDX and test drove that many times. RDX, besides pricey, turned out to be too small compared to Tribeca, especially the tight back seat and small cargo area; it's also way too noisy when speeding up from low speed. Tribeca, on the other hand, feels more solid when turning & smoother speeding up. Some people complained about the gas mileage. I'm getting 21.5 to 23.9 mi/gal combined local and highway in the DC area. For an SUV this size with AWD, I'm happy. Sport shift is certainly helpful to gain speedy pass when needed-easy to use.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my first Subaru...got this vehicle for my wife because of the safety aspects, but we both love it. This is a luxury vehicle at an affordable price. I can't recommend it enough. Good low end torque, with a little less response on the highway. Corners without leaning, haven't had a chance to put the AWD to test. Interior is top-notch and very comfortable, including for back seat passengers. 3rd row is a joke, which is why we purchased the 5 passenger version. We chose this over X3, Murano, Highland, CR-V and CX-7. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We previously owned a Forester for 9 years and found it getting a little small for us, esp. in the rear seat. So we got a great deal on a Tribeca and love it. We won't use the 3rd row much but it's nice to have the option. The rear seat is very roomy with the seat moved all the way back (some don't know there is a second lever for sliding back more). The nav is very good once you figure it out (watch the video it comes with!). Handles very well for its size and has enough power especially compared to the Forester. It gets lots of looks and everyone says it looks much better first hand vs seeing pictures. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the interior design. I also like knowing how much work went into safety. 5 star crash test (Passat only gets 4 stars) plus a good chance to avoid accidents with AWD, multiple air bags and stability control. The tiptronic transmission is great as well. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Sleek exterior and diamond gray color is awesome. Front grill is toned down with less chrome. Interior ergo is good and quality is up there with European cars. Ride is comfortable yet firm enough to handle twisties easily. Quiet ride as well. Brakes good. Could use a bit more power but adequate for an SUV. Honda Pilot a bit roomier since it's a box but after test driving both, you'll take the Tribeca for everything else it offers that the Pilot doesn't. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my new '07 Tribeca for a month now, and I absolutely love it. I shopped the Nissan Murano, and Lexus RX330, but ultimately had to go with the Tribeca. It's got a 3rd row (which fits adults comfortably, despite some reviews I read), which neither Nissan nor Lexus even offer. Plus I could get leather, dvd back-up camera and nav for thousands less than the Murano or RX330. This car is fun to drive, it has plenty of power. The only downside is the gas mileage has been awful, I'm averaging 16 mpg, with a mix of highway and around town (with air on, it's been hot!). Plus the tank only holds 16 gallons, so fill-ups are frequent. Overall, this car looks and feels very luxurious.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I thought the puddle lights were a waste of money until I saw them at night. Very cool! My daughter calls it "the rock-star car" now. Also I like how you can watch dvd on the front monitor screen if the parking brake is on. Useful when waiting while picking up kids, etc.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle was purchased for my wife. She wanted an SUV that wasn't too big, wasn't too small, wasn't the same as everyone else, and had lots of features. We test drove everything (17 in total) from $25K to over $70K. We liked the Porsche Cayenne S, but didn't feel like spending that much. We also liked the Lexus RX350, but everyone has one. The Subaru B9 Tribeca was the last one we tested and we only tried it because the Porsche and Audi dealer also sold Subaru. We liked it so much, and the dealer gave us a very good deal on a just off the truck 2007 model, that we bought it that day. We have taken it on two long road trips and love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Best vehicle I have ever owned. Rides smooth and the interior never fails to impress. AWD is superior and the build quality is second to none. For the price the Lexus and Acura can't touch the B9. So far two friends about to buy Pilots, even had deals together, bought B9s after test driving them at my suggestion. It certainly is worth a look for anyone in the luxury or near luxury SUV market.</TEXT>
