<TEXT>Bought car as B-day present for self. Was great. super fast. The Sync Rev is awesome. You can basically drive it as if it's a manual w/o the clutch. Burning out is easy, won every race I had with it but 1. The only problem was axle broke on me after 2 months while swerving to not hit something (freak accident) Still love this car. The 370 is better in some ways, not all. I would most def recommend this car. If you get this car get the NISMO. It looks better. Love this car though. you can get one for a good deal ina lot of places now really cheap because of 370Z. My car was white with limo tint w/ 18" chrome also with orange interior. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>3.5L V6 w/306 hp. Is a head turner for sure. Very Fast. Real sport look and feel. Bose system. Bluetooth. Best car I've ever had so far.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have always been a huge fan of sports cars; but this one takes the cake. I got it w/ just under 25000 miles on it & it still looks immaculate. Everything about the vehicle is outstanding except for the hard plastics which has been vastly improved w/ soft materials in the 370. If you can ignore that minor issue, you will be very satisfied w/ the iconic Z. I prefer the 370 but did not get it because this one was a steal!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm 56 years old and after raising 5 children I decided to get something for me. I looked at several other cars and for one year I did all my homework. I looked at the Miata, RX-8, and the BMW Z-4. The 350m is by far the most exhilarating car I've ever driven. I bought the 6 speed and it will do about 35 mph per gear. You do the math! And the mileage, I get around 26 average. And the funnest thing I like to do is turn. Man this car will cut like nothing I've ever driven. So my overall rating is "don't test drive one if you aren't going to GET ONE!"</TEXT>

<TEXT>My son and I drove 260 miles to get this car new. Actually he drove 250 miles; I drove the last 10 miles. It was the exact color combo I was looking for, and I managed to drive it off the lot for less than a used one. I had been looking for months at convertibles that I could feel comfortable in and still have disposable monthly income left for savings and eventual retirement. I looked at the 2 pricey Porsche, the mild mannered miata, the 2 large Corvette and the Honda s2k my son's dream car, which he eventually bought. I believe I got the best of all four cars in my z: speed, luxury, great looks, reliability and affordability!I will be zgo tripin for years to come!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power top and the power up and down windows. The 6 speed manual transmission coupled with the 306hp V6 engine. The car grips quite well during hard cornering. The heated leather seats. Finally I get 0-60mph in less than 5.5 seconds CONSISTENTLY! What's not to love!! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a very great car to drive. My car is the base model 350z coupe. Has less "features" than the other models. Doesn't have the stereo unit controls on the steering wheel. Steering wheel seems a bit less sporty than what you get out of most other sports cars. The power is great, and sounds great especially with dual intakes! Definitely a head turner and I'm always getting props. Base Model comes without Traction Control System and the Limited Slip Differential. Meaning, you have to be VERY careful when taking turns and gassing it. You can easily lose control. Which is a reason why professional drifters prefer this model because you can slide everywhere. Donuts are easy. Very fun car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine/exhaust sound is great. I love the automatic window up/down feature for BOTH windows. Dual intake. Sometimes I love the fact that my car doesn't have TCS and LSD to slide, but sometimes when you DO want to take a hard corner while gassing it, you can't without sliding all through the turn.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>NISMO Z</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I read the professional reviews by Edmunds and was a little concerned where they stated the car was not a daily driver, etc. I loved the styling much better in person than pictures. The body and added performance bits were for me though. I have been driving the car for a year now (and in the winter with winter tires and different rims) all I have to say is that this is definitely a daily driver car and I live in NE Ohio. The Sport suspension and killer looks never fail to impress. Added the NISMO intake kit and wow what a sound. As good a ride as any performance car. Go figure... It all depends what you like. I have driven 14K miles in this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks, the stiffer body especially when taking tight turns, the sound and the darn good acceleration. Fun, Fun, Fun who needs a "T" bird anyway !</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got my 2007 Grand Touring Roadster (convertible) just about 5 months ago, and overall, I'm really happy with my purchase. I bought this as a second car (couldn't part with my BMW 325i), and thought I'd primarily drive it on weekends and when the weather is nice. Well, I haven't driven the Beemer but maybe 5 times since getting my Z. I'll garage the Z when the winter comes, but until then, I'm in it with the top down. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Solid feel, grips the road like it's on rails. Engine/exhaust sound, especially when downshifting at a stop light. Automatic window down feature on the key fob. My beemer has that, too, and it's really cool, especially when it's hot outside. Garage door opener feature on the rearview mirror.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>There are lots of things about this vehicle that make it a great buy; value for the dollar; fuel economy about 20% greater than advertised; excellent road griping ride; quick responsive, powerful engine; nice exhaust roar; sharp, expensive looks; automatic, convertible pull down; quality interior and exterior.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Too many to mention, but road handling, braking, would be at the top</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased a new 350Z Conv. and it's awesome. The interior design is very simple, which I love about Nissan, not too little, not too much. When I heard this car crank up for the 1st time, I thought I was going to start salavating. All in all, I love that "WOOM" sound it makes. The engine just barks at you and I'm a 30 yr old female. The salesman said I could get a turbo put on it. I told him, he was insane. That's asking for trouble. Best sports car for the money!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Digital display panel. Steering wheel controls. Autodimming rear view mirror. Gas mileage (for a sports car). Bose system w/ subwoofer.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned many cars both American made and Japanese, but this car is by far the best quality I have seen in some time. Being that it is a convertible it does have some squeaks and rattles sometimes but other than that the car is exceptional. Bose stereo is nice and loud even with top down. Very impressed with the quality of the leather used for the seats. The only gripe I have this far is that this car absolutley needs to lose some weight...weighing in at 3600 lbs it is nearing my old 300c with the hemi.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Waited 37 years since I laid eyes on the 1st Z back in 1970. Owned a 280 and 300, but this is the car of my dreams. Owned almost a year, 8K miles. It has exceeded all my expectations. Few cars outrun it, no cars outclass it. Best described by one car editor as "painfully beautiful". A literal work of art from any angle. Nissan did this right, with a ground-up redesign keeping true to the true spirit of this legendary car. Tame enough for daily commutes, but it turns into a different car when the tach hits 4K. The interior is a cockpit. The power and steering effortless. My hearts skips faster every time I see it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's a Z. Specifically, the burnt orange leather seats, the cockpit with gauges, the gorgeous exterior that fascinates at every angle. Oh, those LED bullet taillights. The longing, envious stares from everyone.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a sweet ride. Better than the 2003 touring coupe model I owned. The 2007 models have more power through the whole rpm band.The car is well balanced and is lots of fun to drive. Yes there are faster cars for the money but this one looks good, drives great, and is well made.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car blows me away. I've had it up to 160 twice and haven't got the guts to shift into 6th yet. The acceleration is awesome. The cornering is impressive. Drove it from Shreveport LA. to Miami FL. on vacation. I am 55 yrs old and bad back but the ride was superior. No aches or pains from driving. Had a 1969 Chevelle SS 369 stock 325 hp and it would have been no match for the Z. Best car I've ever owned! Running through those six speeds will take your breath away! On the highway it grabs onto the road as it glides effortlessly through the air. The quality of the ride is not reflected in the price. The only thing that would impress me more would be more horse power. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cornering ability, gas mileage (avg 25.4), turbine sound when accelerating, great looks, 18" rims, traction control, extremely quiet at highway speeds, seat seems to HOLD you, very smooth. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought a new 2007 350Z Touring Roadster. What an awesome car!! I have owned several Nissan cars. Altima, Sentra Spec V and now a 350Z. The Spec V was great, but the 350Z is no comparison. Fuel economy is what I expected for a sports car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had some issues with the clutch which I have had to take back to the dealership for warranty repair. The clutch was sticking to the floor. They fixed it, but it still grinds when trying to shift into 2nd, 5th, and 6th gear too fast. So I still need to find the time to get that fixed. Other than that, I love the car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the bluetooth handsfree phone system and the Bose stereo system is not too bad for a stock stereo system.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>LarryG</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>The car is an absolute hoot to drive. The biggest problem I have with it is that I should have spent the extra money to go with the second level trim to get the cruise and traction control. Nissan should include those two devices and the extra air bags on every Z they sell even if it means adding a little more to the base price. It would make a big difference, especially given the high performance status of this vehicle. Remember, it's not just for looks, this car already has the eye appeal, it's a safety issue and that should be at the top of all other considerations. Nissan, wake up and get with the program!</TEXT>

<TEXT>It is a great car for a price tag under $30,000. I would not spring for a loaded model that puts the price tag close to $40,000. Would rather get in to a Corvette or Porsche Cayman. Definitely a performance oriented car that comes with less than great fuel consumption and a tight but pleasant interior. Have not gotten close to the advertised fuel rating. The car only sees city driving, so that could be the reason. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2007 Z is a joy to drive. The last Z that a drove was an '05. I also owned a 2006 G35 coupe. There is a huge difference from both of those vehicles to the 2007 350Z with the new engine, especially in the the power/road handling performance. I have owned and driven a lot of cars: Infiniti M45 w/ 340hp, AcuraTL TypeS, etc. Nothing even begins to compare in the speed and handling department. I love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Much faster than I expected. I knew the '07 model would be little faster but I was in awe.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Z. Had a 2003 350Z Touring and there is no comparison. The improvements that they've made were right on target. Engine is stronger, interior is more comfortable and better looking. Loved my old car, absolutely ecstatic about the new one. If Nissan keeps making them, I'll keep buying them.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am extremely happy I chose the Z. Mine is black with a soft top. The lines are sleek and powerful. The factory rims are phenomenal. My colleague owns a 911 and I wouldn't trade rims with him for anything. The ride is smooth and the engine is extremely responsive. Honestly, the car is almost too quick for me, but I am steadily getting acclimated. I love the car and I would recommend it over any of the other roadsters I see floating around the roadways.</TEXT>

I had looked at other sports cars (e.g. porsche, corvette) and feel very good about this choice. This is perhaps the best sports car in terms of cost and performance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2007 350Z (Enthusiast / Redline Red / 6mt) has the re-done VQ35HR 306 horse engine. This engine has 80% new internal engine parts and dual fresh air intakes. The performance is phenonenal with tachometer redline limits now at 7500 with engine improvements. This is a true sports car with road handling capabilities rarely found except on high end sports cars. </TEXT>
