<TEXT>The comfort level is phenomenal. I'm less fatigued on long drives even after a full workday! Everything is within the driver's complete reach. This is my first Honda, or foreign auto for that matter, and I am completely sold. Their performance record is certainly an added bonus. You can't beat the quality and value for the price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The shear size of the vehicle!! I feel totally safe when driving this SUV on highways and interstates. All the safety features such as VSA and simply the Tire-Pressure Monitoring make for a worry free trip.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have never even been in a vehicle with better storage area that services the driver, as many cup holders for the rear, and overall family friendly design. If I were wealthy I would have bought two, so when this one wears out I would have another. There is no other vehicle you could GIVE me that I would like more. This truck fits family and professional life. It is quality inside and out. Go for it if you are considering the Pilot.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the driver storage. Love the heated seats. Love the dual A/C. Love the sound system. Love the versatility with the seating. Love the height. Love, love, love it all.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The greatest part of the Pilot is in its comfort. I'm 6'2 and feel very comfortable in this vehicle. Easy to drive and I never get fatigued. Plenty of knee room - good support. Biggest drawback is common with all AWD SUVs - mileage. 17 city - 21 highway, but hey, I knew that. If you want great mileage, buy a Civic or Corolla.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything is relatively well located and easy to use. Nice climate control; plenty of storage. A very well built, quiet, comfortable car</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I picked ours up CPO with 18k on it. Gas mileage is good for it's size, 18 around town 22-23 if you stay at 65 on the highway. Much quieter than the Odyssey we had previously but not a quiet car by any stretch. Mostly tire noise so a different set may solve that. Great ride, decent pickup.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the great gas mileage that the Pilot gets as we travel all over the country. I can fit comfortably many of my children's friends. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the heated seats although we really don;t need them as much in the south. The controls on the steering wheel is a great asset. By far, the third row seats that completely fold down were the seller for me. My young daughter is already 5'10 but fits nicely in the third row seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I read all the reviews on the Pilot they were wonderful and then I bought one - a 2007 and I hate it. The gas mileage is terrible, I hate how car mfg lie. I get 11-13 city and most on the hwy is 20.5. The dealer keeps making excuses for the poor mpg. I have already had a intake senor replaced - it did not help. So what good is the ECO light staying on to cut out the cylinder so get you better mpg. What JOKE! My husband's F150 gets more consistent mileage then the pilot. Will never buy another Honda (this was my first and last)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a jeep, and the Honda is much more reliable. I only go the the dealership for scheduled maintenance, and minor problems. I would recommend this vehicle to the person who is very busy in their life, and does not want to go to the dealership every week for problems. When you don't drive aggressive, the mileage is acceptable for the size. If you drive hard, the mileage will decrease. I would purchase another one. This is my first Honda. You really do not have to purchase any other brand! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought Pilot EXL AWD over a year back and thought I would use it for a while before I did the review. A year and 10K miles later, I am completely satisfied with my Pilot. This vehicle gives you the practicality of a minivan or close without having to buy a minivan. The vehicle has good ergonomics and the lot of nice storage compartments, etc. It handles well and gives about 21.5 mpg on the highway and about 16 ~17 in the city. The third row seats are excellent, for moderate sized adults. Great Value for Money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great Value for Money. DVD is in the front dash so you can swap them out without stopping the car. Huge boot space and comfortable third row seating. Good mileage. Lots of storage space and door pockets. Airbags all round, side, curtain, etc.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got this because me and the wife needed not only the extra space, but also something that would not strand us when it snows. It has all the safety features we need for our two boys (2 yrs and one on the way). It yelled at my wife for not buckling up! That was awesome. The Pilot handles like a dream. Whenever I need that extra kick, it gives it to me. On the snow, it responds smoothly with no shakiness. I don't know what others had, but my wheels have not shaking going past 65. I have gone as fast as 85 with no waggle. But the road noise was something else. </TEXT>

Compared to our previous SUV which was a 4 Runner from Toyota, the Honda Pilot appears to be a more solid vehicle. It gives you a great sense of security.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle because my family and I did not want a mini van. The Pilot is excellent in all ways because of not only safety but comfort, and reliability. The Navi is great and we got the pilot for $5000 off msrp! The only quirk with the pilot is it seems to hesitate during acceleration and the dealer couldn't duplicate it. But other than that this car just ROCKS in almost every way!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my new Pilot for a month now. Smooth ride, comfortable seating, large cargo area with third row folded flat. Gas mileage has been as advertised (18+ city), just don't gun it off the line and you'll be fine. Crossbars on roof rack should be standard. Don't notice the front-end wobbling at high speeds, others have complained about.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this vehicle mostly because we disliked it the least. Coming out of driving only cars, I am appalled at how poorly this thing handles. Steering response is so slow mushy that I feel like I am sending signals to the engine room ("hard aport!") whenever I make a steering adjustment. Also, I was very surprised that the 6disk CD changer does not play mp3 encoded disks. On the plus side, the build quality is excellent, the engine is quite and responsive and the seating arrangement is very versatile </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second PILOT. The first was a new 2004 LX (great vehicle). The 2007 EX-L however is an outstanding vehicle. Honda has refined the design. Listened to the customer and made small changes that make a big difference in the PILOT driving experience.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>244 hp 3.5L i-VTEC engine w/VCM. A ton of power for smooth acceleration. Very quiet smooth ride. Handles like a dream. The 2004 model was a bit underpowered (problem corrected in 2007). The 2007 is also quieter than a 2004.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far this vehicle has exceeded my expectations. My combined mileage has been 19 MPG and as advertised, 22 MPG straight out highway driving. Cabin noise level is very quiet. What little road noise there is, comes from the cheap Goodyear tires. I have read a few online reviews about "drive line vibes" but even up to 90 MPH, my Pilot is very smooth and drives very tight. We have had 2 snowfalls recently; the 4WD works great and the vehicle gets excellent traction. The Pilot drives, rides and performs much better than the Grand Cherokee, Explorer and Four Runner. These vehicles don't compare in quality either.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>FUN,Great acceleration-much better than my 5.4 L Expedition. The interior is awesome-typical Honda fit and finish. The front and middle row leather seats are very comfortable and there are lots of storage pockets, cup holders and 12 V jacks. Interior room and quality are much better than the Explorer.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Zero problems after 4.5 months. Very useful storage space. Acceptable boat towing capability except for frequent shifts at highway speeds. Transmission is very smooth, and acceleration is quite good considering the tiny engine. Disappointing highway gas mileage to date has only been approximately 20 mpg. Climate control and audio systems are excellent. People comfort in the first two rows is very good. Third row is folded down for additional storage, and will never be used. Handling is okay. Brakes are easy to modulate, but panic stops require more pressure than any of my other recent vehicles. A very satisfactory but not a spectacular vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got 2k off of invoice to buy the Pilot in January. The EX-L MSRP is $33,840, the invoice was $30,530 and I paid $28,530. How can you go wrong? Great truck! The new Acura (visions of the new Pilot) doesn't really make me want to wait and buy at or near sticker. I think it is well equipped, very comfortable and as safe as any vehicle on the road. I was considering a Benz or BMW but everyone I talk to that has one says you have to sell before the warranty is up. As good as any vehicle for the money- it is a depreciating asset. I wish there were better colors. I have no idea what some others have said about a vibration at 55mph. They must need a tire balance. GREAT TRUCK BUY IT!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Pilot. I strayed from Honda with my last vehicle being a Toyota. I thought the quality were similar. I was wrong! Owned Honda's since the early 90's and never regretted it once. I feel extremely safe in my Pilot. Quiet ride although it is still a truck. Very little leaning taking corners at higher speeds. Really holds to the road. Extremely roomy and comfortable. If you are trying to decide to buy this vehicle, do it. You wont regret it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Had an 06 Accord EX-L and then bought the 07 Pilot EX-L. The engine, transmission, and 4WD system are all flawless..."Effortless engagement" are the two words that come to mind when describing these systems. The engine is silky smooth and near silent. The tranny is always in the right gear and never misses a beat. You can barely feel the tug when the rear wheels kick in. Considering the size and weight of the vehicle rides almost as nice as the Accord. Love the size and interior space, great for hauling loads of just about anything around. Could have bought any SUV manufactured by the big 3 and save thousands but still chose the Pilot. Simply put, "It's a Honda."</TEXT>

<TEXT>Performance, in several different facets, is near top of the line. The handling around turns for a vehicle of that size is jaw dropping to me having been previously accustomed to driving an Explorer for 6 years. I was initially somewhat skeptical that an engine displacement of "only" 3.5 L was enough to get the kick in the pants sometimes required to merge into tight traffic. Again, very impressed with the Honda VTEC engine. Its operation is very smooth, quiet and very responsive when getting into the higher RPMs thanks to the variable valve timing. It's more acceleration than I'll ever need for daily commuting. Plenty of room for passengers in three rows of seating. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Items I especially liked: --3 rows of seating. --comfortable clean interior --smooth ride and engine performance --spring for the leather; it's a must --VTEC's VVT high RPM acceleration was lights out --larger (heavier body) and smaller engine than my Ford Explorer, yet fuel economy is better.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Beware before you buy a Honda Pilot. The car has lots of peep, but that is about it. After 65 mph, the front wheel shakes like crazy ( there are hundreds of complaints on the web about this). Honda cannot find the problem. We took the car there 7-8 times!!!!! Next, after a few months, smoke began pouring out of the A.C. and could not be driven. Then a few weeks ago, an electric problem stranded my wife and daughter (who was coming home from the Doctor). The next week, the same thing happened again. Finally, the gas mileage is HORRIBLE. Just as bad as my Ford Expedition. The EPA of 17/22 is not even close!!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I truly Love driving the Pilot. However, it's been back to the Dealership at least 8-10 times, for numerous problems. Seven times for the same problem. I worked for Honda as the Finance Director for 15 years,and brought in hundreds of Customers.I'm in the process of going directly to the top of Honda for help. The problems I have had,are unbelievable. I've owned 5 Honda's and Love them, my commuter has 162,000 miles, and I Love the Pilot. However, I will NOT KEEP THIS CAR. Things happen, and WOW, I have had too many problems to write about. They say they can't duplicate the problem? I have 2 major problems, and, I've had 7- 8 others, they fixed. However,the 2 Major PROBLEMS THEY CAN'T?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really enjoy the Pilot. I would put the gear shift knob in the middle, not on the steering wheel. I highly recommend Honda to everyone !

<TEXT>Went with the 2007 Pilot over the CRV to get extra space as we often total 4 adult passengers, and sometimes more. CRV felt a little tight for 4 tops. Preferred the superior quality of the leather in the Pilot. CRV leather felt thin and has a tufted look, which some may prefer, but we don't. CRV felt somewhat underpowered, but not too bad. No question the Pilot has plenty of power. Overall very pleased with the Pilot. Expecting it will do well in the snow if we get any. </TEXT>

What we found that at several thousands less and with all of the features we wanted, including Rear backup camera and DVD navigation we couldn't shy away from the value this vehicle has to offer. With the money we saved we opted for several accessories to add some class such as wood trim and chrome tubes steps and we still only hit the $31,000 mark. We got a great deal and a awesome car. This vehicle's MSRp with Accessories is over $36,000 wow. You won't be disappointed. One note though, if there is any thing I would change it would be a tighter or firmer steering </TEXT>

<TEXT>This Pilot (AWD with NAV) replaces my 2003 Infinti FX35. The FX was a great vehicle with three exceptions. Very poor seating, driver seat power buttons under your right leg, Extremely rough ride in rear seat when driving on anything other than a very smooth road, and very poor visibility due to rounded design. Honda, on the other hand has excellent visibility, plenty of glass area, plus third row seating,and runs on regular gas plus most of the options I had on the Infiniti for $14,000.less at sticker.After looking at big sister Acura, decided to stay with little sister, Honda Pilot.

<TEXT>The family is soon to grow again so we decided to swap out the '03 CRV. While the mileage suffered (not surprisingly), we're so happy with our decision to go with the Pilot. It's a blast to drive and has so many handy little features that we didn't realize we were missing out on. Incredibly solid on the road -- feels very substantial without feeling just plain BIG. We're just hoping this thing performs as well in snow as the CRV did (I've read less than stellar reviews on the Goodyear Integrity tires that come on the Pilot). So far, we love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Car is a little too big for my original needs but it is better to have more space than less. Fuel economy reasonable for its size. Seat a little hard to get comfortable in-- I am very big. Well made, peppy, lots of creature comforts. Nav system a fun toy. Back up camera useful. All in all an excellent value. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked for an SUV for my wife for 6 months, including BMW, M-B, others. My wife didn't give the OK until she drove the Pilot. Lots of bells/whistles, but well laid out & easy to use. It's incredibly well- equipped, with pleasant surprises everywhere. She raves about it, and her friends want the salesman's card!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seating/cargo flexibility -- room for 8, or fold the seats and carry lots of stuff. Better than our old Dodge minivan. Also like the XM Satellite -- too bad we don't get a signal in Hawaii!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I know, I know, to have two of the same vehicle sounds different however we cross the continental divide often in the winter. We liked front wheel drive (had a minivan) but having an extra two drive wheels has been often reassuring. One of us is not very hip on the outside design but is comforted by their quality mechanicals. Most people who ride in them comment that they will seriously consider buying one also. Plainly, that is what sells these Pilots! Looking to motor in them for at least 10 years or 200,000 miles whichever comes first.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We are ex-minivan customers and like the squareness of the interior. Shoulder room and greenhouse height makes these a very nice medium sized SUVs. The 110v plug-in for charging small appliances is very handy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have owned our Pilot for 8 months and have been very happy with it. We were looking for a smaller SUV that could still seat 8 people if needed. The back seats are cramped when you have 8 people or children in the car but are adequate for short trips. The acceleration is good and it has a tighter turning radius than our last vehicle (Chevy Impala) which makes it nice for parking. The fuel mileage isn't all I had hoped that it would be - about 16-18 mpg city and about 22 highway. Doesn't have automatic headlights which took some time getting used to. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased my 2007 Honda Pilot last year in summer. Just after getting home with it I heard the horror stories about mice. I thought OK so maybe some people have problems with mice. Hopefully I don't. No such luck, I just got back from paying the dealership to remove a mouse from the blower housing. Wonderful! This is not a small problem apparently, this is a big one! Honda has been very silent about this longstanding problem and is not stepping up to the plate to solve it. I must say that we have had mostly Chev/GMC products up to this Honda and we have NEVER had a problem with mice. I am thinking of putting signs on the windows of my Honda advertising what a mouse house it is!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Pilot for just over a year and have enjoyed it minus a few exceptions. A clip of some type either came off or was not put on (somewhere connected to the transmission) in the first place leaving me unable to move in the middle of traffic. NOT GOOD. I called the dealer from the road and they towed me in, fixed the the ride in about 3 or 4 days. This left me with one vehicle. I wasn't given a good enough explanation of what happened but no problem with that to date. The subwoofer is either popping or rattling the areas next to it. My dealer so far has not been able to fix the problem to my satisfaction.Finally there is a slight pull to the left I will see if the dealer can adjust.</TEXT>

<TEXT> Hoping this was a good cross for road trips AND towing, it good only on road trips. Quiet, comfortable and great ergonomics inside. Typically SUV, bulky to drive/handle. Terrific reliability. In short a great people and stuff hauler It is not a good towing vehicle. I have a 2700# tent trailer (when fully loaded) and the rear end drops considerably and with the severe cut off on the headlights, night driving is hazardous due to oncoming traffic high beam warning flashing. It doesn't have anywhere near a low gear going down grades and is clearly not an off road vehicle.

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle for my wife who stays home with our 1 year old son at the time. So I wanted safety number one and the ability to haul everything you must take when traveling with a toddler. The Pilot does a great job in all respects. It made the 8 hour drive to North Dakota much tolerable with its large cabin space and also large cargo area with the 3rd row seat folder down. It rides high so you would not want to make any sudden moves on the highway as it does seem a bit tippy, but on the other hand you need the clearance in Wisconsin if you are ever to make it up north. I give the Pilot props for comfort and cargo room and negative for fuel economy tippy feeling.</TEXT>

The kids (I have two) constantly complains that it is too cramped and they're only three and five. The Odyssey just provides better value in terms of comfort, cargo room, and gas mileage. The Pilot is the vehicle I use to travel to work. On the weekends, it is strictly the Odyssey with the family.</TEXT>

We have three small boys in car seats and they all fit in the 2nd row, or two in the 3rd. with all the accessories, cherry color, $29,500 purchase price (best value for the money), safety features, confort, and reliabity, the Pilot has the whole family very happy.

<TEXT>I've had my Pilot for 4 months and drive it mostly in town but took one extended 2,400 trip. We're very pleased so far. We've found excellent build quality and reliability. Mileage has been good; 18.7 in city and 24.8 on the highway (65+/-). I'm 6-1 and drove 14 hours one day and rode in the backback seat for 10 hours another day. The front seats are very comfortable for extended periods and the backback seat was better than I thought it would be. My wife loves the shifter because it frees up the console area. Steering and engine are great, ride is good, and after getting a good EOY deal, it was $8k less than the Acadia/Enclave I shopped. My insurance premiums are less than my old Passport.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very comfortable interior, good headroom, smooth ride. Seats fold flat for cargo and fold and slide smoothly. Leather interior is supple but durable and comfortably firm.

The back seating is not made for long distance trips,just trips that are less than a mile long to the local store...think twice about these seats if you care about your guests! Where is the power in this vehicle...it struggles to pull what it is designed to pull. The gas mileage is not was it is stated on this site...it is less more like 13 and 17.

I know there is a new designed Pilot coming out, but the true is that I like the current square shape. I little wood inside will be a plus. The fuel economy isn't good, but the vehicle is strong and is still a car-body-frame easy and fun to drive.

<TEXT>After much research and comparison shopping, we decided on the EX-L w/AWD, and feel like we hit the jackpot-especially in the value category. I am more fond of this vehicle each week. It now has 5K miles, and has really proven itself to be the ultimate in practical suburban family vehicle. We also looked at the 07 Highlander, and nearly fell asleep at the wheel in the showroom. Also considered a certified X3, but cargo area way too small. The Pilot is no Ferrari, but it is predictable, comfortable and sure footed. We have taken it on several comfortable weekend road trips. When my died-in-the-wool car snob father drove it (drives a Lexus GX & BMW Z3) said "wow, this is impressive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>First off, for all of you complaining about the gas mileage, you're nuts. I have a Dodge Durango and the Pilot. There is no comparison whatsoever. For the 3k miles we have put on it, we are averaging about 21 mpg. Now if you have the 4x4 version, I can see a decrease. But all you others probably just have a lead foot! There are only two negatives that I have with the Pilot. First, the front driver side leg room is not what I would like it to be. Second, the back door is a pain in the rear to close sometimes. I wish they would have made it about 1/2 a foot longer, then a tall guy like me would not have any issues up front! If you buy one, you will fall in love with it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first SUV and I couldn't be happier. We wanted a vehicle large enough for our family of four to travel comfortably on road trips, but not too big that we would spend a fortune on gas. We contemplated a mini van but wanted something more sporty without sacrificing interior room. The Pilot is perfect for us! It's fun to drive, comfortable and looks great. I highly recommend this vehicle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned many fine cars including Infiniti, Toyota, and Mazda. This vehicle tops them all. Very comfortable in long drives, great cargo room, and room for 7 easily. Great economy for size and easy to maintain. Great power when needed and great visibility. The only negative, and it's minor, a slight blind spot when checking traffic from the right due to post angle. Other than that, I rank this SUV as best in class.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Pilot a few weeks ago after a lengthy search that included other SUVs like the Pathfinder and 4Runner. The price and the Honda name helped me to decide on the Pilot. We bought a new EX-L Pilot with leather and aftermarket navigation. We also purchased a 7x100k extended warranty. I could not be happier with the decision both financially and with the SUV itself. The Pilot runs great, gives decent gas mileage and has more room than I know what to do with. I have always been a car person but now I don't think I can go back. The exterior is somewhat plain and is by no means a head turner but the interior layout and design is excellent. I would recommend this SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my Pilot for a few weeks now and have not been disappointed. Gas mileage is acceptable for SUV - getting no worse than previous minivan while providing a very comfortable ride. Compared to '08 Nissan Pathfinder and '07 Saturn Outlook, the Pilot can be purchased for thousands less when comparably equipped while giving the owner a very handsome trade-in value down the road. Vehicle has excellent fit and finish both inside and out. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This has been a great vehicle for us. Enough room for our stuff and our dog and still room for the additional family member coming in about 7 months. But look out if you have to replace certain parts. $275 fog light assembly plus 1 hour labor to remove the entire bumper cover because the fog light was hit with a rock. Hopefully insurance will cover, but what if it had just burned out? $400 for a lightbulb? Sad that such a great car has such poor design qualities.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First SUV and what a winner. Wanted to go cheaper and needed cargo space, so I just went with the FWD. I've had it for 2 months. Fun to drive. Step on the gas and you are flying, if need to. A little wider in the garage than I am used to. I'm reading all these reviews on the poor mileage and my ride to work, with mixed stop and go and some highway, I'm getting 20 MPG. Doesn't like the road trips with with higher speeds. Only 23 MPG, even with that ECO feature that shuts down three cylinders. Good looking vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration is great. Roomy 2nd row, leg and head room. Love the heater and A/C for keeping people comfortable in back. Third row lays flat and out of site. Lot's of cargo space. Air bags all over the place, if needed. Seems like a sturdy vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I spent a lot of time looking at all the SUV in the 25-35k price range and went to look at each of them. The Honda Pilot EX-L with Navi has them all beat. The car is extremely solid and is very roomy. So far I have owned it for a week and I love it. It drives like a car but has the functionality of a SUV. To own a fully loaded SUV for under $30000 (sticker price $36,000) is amazing. It comes with all the cool gadget as Lexus -$15,000 price tag. It is truly worth the money and will keep its value over the years. </TEXT>

<TEXT>With 1K miles on it now, I'm positive I made the right decision getting the Pilot. I'm not sure why all the negative posts about mileage. It's an SUV folks. They all get poor mileage but the Pilot is amoung the best in class. On a 450 mile trip, I averaged 22.9 mpg cruising at 70 mph. My old Grand Cherokee wouldn't even come close with its antiquated inline 6. I bought this with gas prices over $3 per gallon knowing full well it wasn't going to be cheap to run. For those wanting better mileage, get a Civic. We were only considering Subaru / Toyota / Honda SUV's when we were shopping. The Honda had the best combination of features vs. price point. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Came down to between this and a Highlander. We didn't go with that due to a more cramped interior with much less interior storage space vs. the Pilot. Car is well executed inside and out. Driving experience is consistent with expectations. Smooth drive train, pleasant ride. Reliability has been good to date. Mileage is a bit disappointing, but about what I expected. Averaging 18-20 mpg in mixed driving in first 7K miles, which isn't too bad considering power and weight of car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I loved the mileage on my hybrid but I was having a hard time getting in and out and we travel alot now and needed more room. Only 2 tanks of gas through it so far, first tank combined was 20 mpg. The 2nd tank was all city and was a little over 15 mpg. I averaged over 40 with my hybrid. I love the room and the ride. Mileage is much better then the 2002 Dodge Ram 4 door pickup (6/14) I traded for the hybrid. It is quiter than the Civic and much easier to get in and out of. I feel safer driving it. I did not want 4 WD and the VCM helps with the milage. I have owned a lot of vehicals in my 60 plus years and this one is right up there with the best I have owned. Thank you Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was driving a Volvo X-country that I loved and vowed not to go any bigger. (I am not a minivan person). However, 2 children and friends later, we were looking. This Pilot drives like a dream, is easy to park and does not feel big to drive, but is very spacious inside. I love all the compartments and I love the safety ratings and rear airbags. In my younger day I had a Mustang and I have to tell you that I find this Pilot AS FUN to drive! I find the pick-up very good and find myself looking down and saying "oops! driving too fast"- very smooth ride. My kids love it too. It is an SUV, so I am not fazed by the gas mileage but I find it the same as ads. We did test others but Pilot is the best.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had been planning on a 2007 CR-V but decided that I should drive a couple others before making a decision. I drove the Pilot and loved the ride and power. I knew then that I was kidding myself into thinking I would be OK with the CR-V acceleration. I picked out an LX. I didn't have much need for the extras that came with the EX. I prefer the cloth interior and it doesn't bother me to insert another cd when I am done listening to one. I am actually more of a talk radio type. I do miss the automatic light shutoff. I have to wonder why Honda would have that feature on the LX Accord and not on the LX Pilot. Exiting the back seat seems clumsy.</TEXT>

There is virtually no road noise, and it rides like a dream. I just love everything about this vehicle so far! Just waiting to check the mileage... hoping it gets what the sticker says it will.

<TEXT>Having a Honda minivan, we thought that the Pilot would be a no-brainer purchase. We were wrong. The mileage is so far off on this SUV that it's criminal. I don't think I broke 11-12 mpg on the highway going 55-60 without any cargo or other passengers. The engine is underpowered if you are driving a vehicle that actually contains passengers. The interior is nice, the sound system is good, and all the guages are nicely layed out. The car comes with very little coverage (which is why Honda Care is so strongly "encouraged."

<TEXT>I looked at almost every vehicle out there before deciding on the Honda Pilot. I couldn't be happier. The suv/car does everything right. It's a major improvement over my 2004 Dodge Durango (lease ended)- it's quieter, quicker throttle response, more comfortable, and mostly more fun than most of the vehicles that I looked at, including Nissan Murano, Dodge Magnum, Chrysler Pacifica and especially my Dodge Durango. I love it! and I have already suggested that my friends test drive it to see for themselves. I got a really nice lease deal on the car which helps me say a lot of nice things about it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I would say my favorite feature is the actual character that the car exudes... it has a personality of its own that I can't explain but I like it.
