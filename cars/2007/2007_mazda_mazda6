<TEXT>This car is just absolutely amazing. I am going to hold on to this car until it dies pretty much. It gets me where i need to go and I have no regrets for buying it. I think the people that get on here and complain about this magnificent car must have obviously been spoiled by cars such as Mercedes or Lexus. The seats are not uncomfortable and the fuel economy is a lot better than most cars. If I can drive this car 868 miles from IA to AL without complaining about uncomfortable seats then no one should. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love all of the storage space of this 5 door. I wish Mazda still made attractive 5 doors like mine. The 2007 Mazda 6 just looks so unique compared to other vehicles. The tail lights are very cute and the interior does not look cheap as someone said on here. It shimmers in the sunlight. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car rides great and gets decent gas mileage (ave 28 mph mixed) and has needed only standard maintenance. Solid ride with plenty of people and cargo space and the moon roof, heated seats, six disk cd player with controls on the steering wheel are a nice plus. Excellent reliability for a good price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fun car to drive,looks cute,sporty handling,however seats squeak horribly since day one, paint chips and scratches easily,interior doesn't hold up well-seats and dash trim,gas mileage- max 28mpg hwy driving no more than 65 mph. (would love to know how others are getting 30 mpg +, as they say they are! Don't think its possible, not even using cruise control) Have already replaced catalytic converter and rear main seal at 30,000.Heater has rattling noise that no one can seem to figure out what it is.Has alot of road noise.Would rather own another accord or camry for sure.This car is more comparable with a corolla or civic.Not as impressed with it as salesman was.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I still love this car. Only complaint is I've needed two alignments and gotta but new tires now. Breakaway mirrors and a bit better gas mileage would have been nice. But other than those quibbles, the comfort and handling and the sheer fun of driving remains exceptional. So much cooler than all the Camry's and Accord's out there. Really sad Mazda ended the hatchback line in 07 -- big mistake! That rear space is so convenient for hauling stuff, and the hatchback actually looks better than the Sedan IMO. I'd definitely buy this car again! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Had the car for 15 months, 22K miles. Very comfortable, nice interior layout, good visibility, nice options for the price. Sporty handling but large turning radius. Engine idles a bit rough, smooth while driving, decent power, good gas mileage, average 28 MPG in mixed driving. Excellent brakes, trunk and fold down rear seats. Only problem- steering creaks when going slow-dealer said not a safety issue, greased fittings per tech bulletin, seems better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like quirky cars, and this one fits the bill perfectly. It's not an annoying car, just different. The 3.0L V6 is not as strong as you would think down low, but the car asks you to drive it in a higher rev range. Driving the car higher in the rev range doesn't screw up the fuel economy very much. Gotta love the huge hatch opening. My only gripe is the weird front seats the have too much thigh support for us manual drivers. Yeah, and the shifter itself is slightly clunky, but it performs flawlessly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned Hondas, VWs, a Peugeot, and a Mazda GLC. If I had the cash I would buy a GTI, or BMW, but the 6 is a nice affordable alternative. Good handling and the 2.3 with a stick has enough power to be interesting. The hatch is what sold me. Room for skis and a couiple of bikes. Good car on snow and ice. I put on minus one, 16 inch wheels Nokia studded snows. Use the standard 17's in the summer. Like a lot of cars today there is lack of tie down hooks on the frame, which make it diffcult to pull out of a ditch </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, my Mazda has done everything and more. The long trips and are comfortable and short trips are quick! I enjoy the tight and quick response handling. As for quick comparison, my last car was a Ford SHO and I would have to say that the 4-cylinder in the Mazda really moves when you go from point A to point B safely. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sport shifter, amazing! The windows that roll down when you hold the unlock button down after pressing it twice... way cool. I call it my H.R.S. (Heat Reducing System) I use it in the summer time all the time. Sometimes even when don?t have to, it?s how I introduce my car to friends and family.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my '07 Mazda6 since Sept '07, and it now has about 13000 miles. I still love it! I find excuses to go places just so I can drive it. Some owners and car authors comment about the lack of power from the 4 cyl engine, but I think it has plenty of power. I get over 30 mpg on highway (31.5 usually) and I've never been in a situation where I wished it had more power, even when climbing mountain passes in western NC. I am leasing the car; when lease is up I'm considering buying it. I recently test drove the new '09 Mazda6 and I don't like it as much as my '07; it's too big and lacks the fun-to-drive factor that the old model has. I think Mazda has screwed up with the remake of the 6.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had it for a year now. Fun to drive. A lot more peppy with the manual tranny. Get 30+mpg setting cruise at 80mph on hwys. Had to replace 6 cd changer because it jammed. Also engine started to smoke at 11K miles. Thinking maybe a piston ring? (I let it set all winter = 4months.) Complete engine replaced. Both replaced under warranty with no hassle. Great dealership. Manual tranny and summer tires not great in the snow, drove my truck all winter. Has a lot standard features that are usually costly options with other brands. Great for daily commutes and short road trips.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had owned 3 previous Mazda cars. Thought with this new car I was going to get same quality. Boy was I wrong. I have had to take this car back to dealership for 3 different repairs. Oil pan leaked, air conditioning motor went, now battery is leaking acid and has corroded the wires. Now I found out there is a Ford motor in the car. Can't wait to see what is next. All this and it hasn't been a year. Thank goodness for a warranty. Lot of time wasted, though. I do, however, like the drive and the interior is very spacious. Plenty of room for the kid and all his toys. There are lots of cubbies to hold things. Regardless of the interior space Mazda has lost me as a life long customer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a wonderful car. Mazda's done a great job combining sportiness/design/value in this car. Exterior really draws the eye, it just looks quick. Inside everything about where you expect it to be and falls to the hand easily. Ride is what sells the car to me it's fantastic. I took the 4 cyl for gas mileage (getting 28 from a midsize is fine by me). A little raspy when you put your foot down but it moves. Goes exactly where you point it - handling is a good as previous BMWs and Audis I have owned. This car wants you to push it. Brakes are 1st class. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I enjoy driving this car. I commute 80 miles a day in it, and it definitely feels sporty. I replaced a Celica with this car, and I don't feel like I drive a mommy mobile. This car is not for the people who want cushy ride. I actually enjoy having a car with quirks. EXCEPT the weird clutch feel; that's annoying in stop-and-go. This is the car that Saab used to make, and it's a well rounded vehicle. I'm not crazy about the Bose stereo or the middling fuel economy. The tires are a very weird size which make replacement fairly expensive. I enjoy the rather peaky nature of the V6, it keeps me alert and focused. I can't be a lazy driver</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Mazda6 as a replacement for a Mazda3. The mazda6 was my first brand new car. I love how it drives, and handles! Zoom Zoom... but at 11,500 miles I had the transmission replaced. At 13,000 I am having the transmission fixed, and the front suspension fixed. Sound strange to you? I live in a big city, no backwoods dirt roads, just city pavement. I am so upside down in this car, that I could never get out of it at this rate. I am about to bite the bullet and trade it in anyway, for a Honda. I hope no one else is having these problems.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Mazda 6i SVE about 15 months and I love it, mostly. I've gotten as high as 31.25 mpg on the highway, 23 city. The car is not exceptionally quick but is roomy, comfortable, reliable, and handles phenomenally. It's quiet at freeway speed with good visibility and a lot of nice standard features like ABS, EBD, and traction control. Mine's a redfire metallic and it's an attractive car with the black interior. The only complaint I have at all with the car is the interior quality. The seats are nice and soft but the fabric roughs up and shows wear very quickly. Go for the touring model with the leather seats and door panels if you can. Doors sometimes don't shut well without a retry.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car's stick-to-the-pavement like glue handling, outperforms other sedans like Accord or Camry. The steering wheel mounted audio controls. The price. Decent mileage. Love the leather-wrapped wheel. The 6 CD changer and power driver's seat are nice, too. Love the traction control in winter. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Smooth engine, good handling and nice auto box ruined by worst ride of any car I have owned in 23 years of driving (avoid the 18 inch alloys and Pirelli P Zero tyres). Looks great outside, cheap materials inside. Loads of space and easy loading on the hatch. Lousy economy. Overall, disappointing, as on the surface much more interesting than competition.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought a used S Grand touring Wagon and love it so far. Got almost 28 mpg on a short 400 mile road trip. Tons of cargo space and configurations. The cargo cover doubles as a doggie cage and can also be moved just behind the front seat when the rear seats are folded down. The bottom portion of the drivers seat seem a little short on leg support, could be longer, but otherwise it is a comfortable ride for a big guy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wife was happy with her 2007 silver glacier M6 i 5 Dr Touring HB so shortly after got a 2007 redfire metallic M6 s SVE sedan for myself. The sedan's V6 is very smooth, drives and handles great. The M6 hugs the road very well and is fun to drive and quiet, overall it's a poor man's sports sedan. Best car owned with regards to driving experience. To improve my M6 sedan's looks, found on the internet and added a factory like pre-painted rear wing spoiler for 1/3 the cost of what Mazda charges. Looking to add fog lights. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty looks and styling, the changing digital number in dash that says what gear (1 to 6 for the V6 or 1 to 5 for the 4 cyl) you are in for the AT. The 17" alloy wheels are nice but not unique as see similiar looking ones on other Japanese makes. Rear reading lights and folding center armrests </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my Mazda6 Sport Value Edition hatchback for just over a year and have 25,000 miles on it. This is a fun car with lots of pep. It looks very cool and looks like it's driving even when it is parked. But the seats are not comfortable for me, the blinds spots are too large to be safe and the turning radius is horrendous. Not to mention the Michelin stock tires are terrible in the snow. I'm old enough to have driven rear-wheel drive cars in Minnesota winters so it's not that I'm a new driver. I think the TCS and ABS are probably good, but the tires are awful. Again, really cool car and fun to drive, but too many negatives to want to keep this car very long. Horrible resale!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was driving a 2002 Mazda Tribute and when gas prices shot up to $3 per gallon I decided to trade it in for something with better gas mileage. The Mazda 6 i Sport Value Edition is the perfect car for buyers who want 4-cylinder gas mileage but don't want to sacrifice good looks, performance and comfortability. I am averaging 25MPG on the highway after 4k miles, I usually speed in the left lane. This car is very comfortable to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Drove the accord and civic and altima, they could not touch the Mazda 6. I found the Mazda more comfortable and sportier than the hondas and the altima look is just not for me. MPG is very good in the 4 cyl version and has the power of a 6cyl. Stereo and controls are great unless you think good music only has bass in it. Seating is very roomy and comfortable, options in the value package are perfect. Great car a little noisy on the road but a body underseal will take care of that, usually depends on the road texture. Blue Hi beam indicator is like a laser beam when contrasted with cool red dash lts.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just love this car! I have had it for 2 weeks now and the interior layout is well done as is the exterior. It looks like a peppy midsize car and the performance backs it up. There is a larger turning radius but that was expected with the 17" wheels vs. the 14" on my last car. The traction control and ABS perform wonderfully and those commenting about the wonderful visability through the windshield hit the nail on the head. The red dash lighting is friendly on the eyes when driving at night. Rear passenger map lights, CD changer, numerous storage spaces and comfy seats are also appreciated bonuses in this car. I suggest a test drive. It doesn't take long to get comfy in one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The overall style and the engine response. I was nervous about "downgrading" to a 4cyl but this car has got plenty of horses to satisfy my lead foot. The cup holders are deep enough to hold my coffee in place perfectly. I love the power seat, red dash lighting, the key/remote and the big trunk.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car (4 cyl 5 speed sport value edition) is really hard to beat. Probably a more expensive car, like a BMW, Mercedes, or Cadillac CTS could beat it in many respects. But, for the money (around 20K), this car is unbeatable. Everything about it is well thought-out. I love the size-- not too big, not too small.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The overall size of the car-bigger than the Mazda3 (too small for me), but smaller than Camry, Accord, Altima, which I think are too big for everyday driving with just one or two people in the car. I also love the drive train--engine has a nice "growl", and the shifter has precise short throws.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the 4-cyl, 5-speed Value Edition after driving a 4-cyl Altima for 7 years. The value is unbeatable, it looks great, excellent handling, good gas mileage. The interior is good, with a number of features I did not expect at this price. Front seats are very supportive. The ride is stiff but not harsh. The engine is not as responsive as Altima's, and does not feel as strong. Another complaint is somewhat short gearing, the engine is close to 3k revs at 60 mph; it gets buzzy at higher speeds and MPG suffers. The stereo sounds great, but there is occasional static on FM stations; this did not happen in any other car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my Mazda6 i Sport for this new GT V6 model thinking it would be much better. I was thrilled with my 4 cylinder car, and I really cannot notice much more zoom-zoom in this new one, unless I'm going up a hill. Nice new features that can be found in luxury cars. Gas mileage is horrible even reving the car low with a stick shift, but it was to be expected coming from Mazda. Everyone admires my car. Although I would recommend getting a GT I with 4 cylinder instead of an S with a V6.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fun car to drive. Handles extremely well. Very responsive steering and suspension is a great balance between a good ride and great control. Excellent vision through front windshield. Love just everything about the car. My only complaint driving is the car does not coast well when you take your foot off the gas. You can feel the downshifting as you coast up to a stop sign. It took some getting used to. I kept coming up short to lights and stop signs and would have to reaccelerate. Only automatic I have driven that does this. Dealership says this is the Mazda transmission.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the i Touring automatic in July, and have 8500 miles already. The only complaints so far are that acceleration is sluggish with the A/C on, and that the A/C doesn't blow as cold as I'm used to. This is a great family hauler with sporty looks; much more masculine than the Accord/Passat/Camry/Sonata bunch. Averaging 27 mpg in mixed driving and 32 in straight highway driving.

<TEXT>I got this car to replace my 15 mpg truck and am now getting over 30 mpg. A month before I got it, I never thought that I would ever be driving a Mazda, but I love my car. The handling is amazing, the 4 cyl still has enough oomph for me (I drive it hard). It looks good in any color that it's offered in. I have no complaints about this car. I love driving it. It isn't that expensive, you get over 30 mpg, it's a whole lot of fun to drive, it looks cool, it's safe. Mazda knocked this one outta the park.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The hatchback! If you are interested in getting a Mazda6, get the 5-door version. The ease of getting anything in or out of the back is much easier. It has tons of storage. I am SO happy that I got the 5-door hatchback. A must have feature!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car to replace my 2003 6s, which my brother now owns. I put 97,000, mostly highway miles on it in just under 4 years. I loved the car! The 2007 is as close a replacement as I could get. However if I could get a new 2003 instead I would have. I prefer the 16 in wheels, the 5 speed automatic (the 6 spd downshifts at very modest hills and get the same mileage), the key/remote is way too big, and a number of small amenities in the interior have been dropped. The only thing I like better is the smoother frequency response of the new speakers: I find the 6 CD changer to be a pain, though. All that said, I still love the car, just not as much as my 2003!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great handling, brakes, better speakers than my 2003, it's a great traveling car with great interior/trunk room. I'm averaging 27 mpg @ 75-80 mph. It looks and feels great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have the only GT manual 6i hatchback that I know of in CA. After waiting months after my factory order it arrived just as requested - violet gray, black leather, iPod integration module. People are blown away when they see it, since there are so few of them in this configuration. It's not the fastest car, but it handles very well. The MPG is spectacular. I'm not even at half a tank and I've already driven almost 300 miles. (I admit that I don't drive real fast, but oh lord, I am loving the MPG thus far.) The Mazda6 is a car underserved by the base model and sport value configurations. That's why there are so many unsold. To really see the beauty of this car, see it decked out! </TEXT>

<FAVORITE>Sporty handling, looks, and feel. Countless standard amenities. 6 disc changer, 6 airbags, 17in rims, sport seats, traction control.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought this car to have an extra car around. The car feels just as good to drive as my main car but for $15k less. Overall it is a great everyday car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mute button on the steering wheel (I've owned at least 6 cars with steering wheel radio controls and this is the only one with a mute button).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The look and feel of the car is great. When it comes to performance and reliability, it broke down twice in the first two months of ownership and within the first 3000 miles. The car jerked and bucked and was inoperable both times and had to be towed to the dealership for diagnostics and repairs. On both occasions, the actuator throttle assembly went bad and had to be replaced. After the second breakdown and over six weeks of the car being in the repair shop, I exercised my lemon law rights as a consumer and got a full refund. This time, I purchased the much more reliable Honda Civic.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior and exterior features of the car, very sporty, drives like a sports car, takes regular unleaded gas, fun to drive, very smooth shifting manual transmission.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the third Mazda I've owned (my trade in was a 1992 B2600, original owner, with 176,000 and still running strong). This 6 has been a blast to drive. First tank of gas got 28mpg. Good leg room in the back. We've have 5 people in the car and didn't feel cramped. A 5 speed is the way to go if you drive a manual.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The look, the feel. Huge trunk for such a sporty car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 6 is a sharp looking little car. Get behind the wheel and the V6 gets you up and moving promptly. Throttle response is quick, though if pressed too hard the engine is prone to rev hard in search of power. The 6 speed auto is especially fun in manual mode, but the close ratios make shifting a busy job. Fuel economy does not appear to reap the benefits of 6 gears, no matter who is shifting. Heading down the road/highway, however, subtle hints creep in that this is not the "touring" car its package advertises. Road noise is fairly high and presents a stiff challenge to the meager standard stereo. The ride, while absolutely stable, is not necessarily smooth and is tiresome on extended trips.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior look. Much more appealing than competitive designs from Honda, Toyota, and Nissan. The automatic transmission with manual mode. The V6 engine, much better performance overall as compared to I4.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ok. This is coming from a "German car snob" all my life. I've owned Mercedes, BMW and Audi and finally got smart. I had a great deal lined up for a Mercedes ML430 (used) then did some reading on the horror stories and breakdowns. So decided to test drive the Mazda6 before I went for a 3 series BMW. Guess what? Save the 10k! The Mazda6 is outstanding, sexy and "prances" down the highway at 80 mph with a solid, quiet feel. Yeah the beemer is a little quieter, better turning radius, and tighter on hard turns, but get over it for thousands in savings with the Mazda6. This company knows where the market is!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sexy. Interior roomy and sharp. Hatchback has a LOT of storage. Reliable. Unique. Prances down the road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drove a V6 Mazda 626 for 11 years until it was totaled in an accident. I reluctantly decided to go with a 4 cylinder this time to save gas. New car does not pick up as fast, but the shifting is very smooth and the power is quite sufficient. Interior is all black, which turns out to look rather sporty from the outside. Seats are very comfortable microfiber with good side bolster support. Driver visibility is terrific, especially out of the front window - better than in my old 626. Engine noise is very low and the ride is smooth. IMHO, the 6i is the best new car value for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Trunk support and rear seat release latch being in the trunk for security reasons. Controls on steering wheel are very convenient.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I first bought the MZ3 and I really liked it. It was the special edition. I had some registration problems and the dealer had to take the car back and I was a little upset. Nevertheless, the dealer made it right by offering another car and I looked at the MZ6. I didn't like it as much as my MZ3 sp at first but now I am so glad I got it. It is bigger, mpg is similiar to MZ3, heavier ride, and sharp to look at. For the money you cannot find a better car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased the 2007 Mazda6i sports value edition. Love the look of the car inside and out. Great looking 17" wheels and love the feel behind the wheel. I purchased the Smokestone exterior color with black fabic interior. Love the way the dashboard lights up at night in red. Good gas mileage and I like the 2.3L 4cyl automatic. Good value for the money spent.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We replaced a 2000 Honda Accord with the 2007 Mazda 6s grand touring. So far the car has been great. We love the style and comfort.The performance is decent but the Accords and Camrys have more horsepower. We have 9100 miles and the car hasn't had any problems. The only real complaint we have is the Pirelli 18" tires that came on the grand touring are noisy, but this is expected for performance tires.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a lot of fun to drive. Before making the purchase I did a lot of research and drove almost all of the comparable sedans. I compare the Mazda 6 to the VW Passat, and I really feel they are quite comparable in ride and handling. I just really feel for the money there is not a better deal out there. I have averaged 27 MPG in mixed driving situations, which is quite an improvement since I almost always am a Mopar/Chrysler/Dodge guy. I like the fact the car is assembled in the USA by UAW workers. That was really the tipping point in my decision to purchase this over a Mazda 3, or some other sedan. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Peppy little motor. Plenty of room, full sized trunk. Nice look to the car. Spoiler. I like the Mazda "switchblade type" key.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At 49 years old I have bought many cars in my life and have never felt compelled to write using descriptive words such as fantastic, fun to drive, love it, etc. Mazda definitely got it right with the Mazda 6i, in addition to giving the consumer a great value in comparing the 6i to a Camry or even a BMW 3 series, they have built what I would consider to be the perfect car for middle America. Having a family car that doesn't resemble a box is refreshing, the 6i is not only sporty in looks as it drives more like a sports car than family sedan.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Being able to switch between driving an automatic or being able to use the 5 speed transmission is not only fun but functional in down-shifting. The 2.3 16 valve engine gives the car a lot of pep. It really does zoom zoom zoom. Love the audio system and controls on the steering wheel. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the Mazda6 almost two weeks ago after test driving the Fusion, G6, Mustang, and Mazda 3. For the money this was the best vehicle I drove. Everytime I test drove another car I would end up comparing it to this car. I was impressed with the smooth ride a surprising power from the 4cyl right of the bat. With all the standard features of this trim leve no other car could come close to matching the price. So far i'm very happy with this car. The first tank of gas got about 25 mpg, I expect it to get better once the engine is fully broken in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first Mazda and it won't be our last. This car is great. Fit, finish, and quality are all exemplary. Though only a 4 cylinder it has ample power for merging and round town driving. Ease of maneuvering make this car fun to drive on the highway or in a parking lot. Very quiet interior and first rate materials abound. Hatchback model looks better than the sedan! Price versus features can not be beat by anyone and all the standard safety features make this a great family car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned may cars over the years ranging from a Porsche to a Focus and also spent 25 years in the car business, mostly hi-line European. We just picked up a 5 speed, Sport Value edition. The 4 cylinder performance with the manual transmission is surprising. Build quality seems very good. The thing that impresses me the most is what you get for the dollar. We had 03 Focus ZX5 with a sticker of $18k and the Mazda is $20380, four years later. For $2300 more the difference is unbelievable. I think the car is on a par with an A4, Saab 9-3,and maybe even BMW 325. If you're in the market for a fun-to-drive, affordable sedan, check this car out. IMHO it's probably the most underrated car out there.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought a new Sport-VE auto a week ago. Loaded with all Value Edition features including 17" alloys. 150 miles on it so far, so just breaking in the engine. Excellent handling and throttle response - this is a driver's car on a budget. Quiet engine at idle, though growly when pressed hard. Superb 5-speed auto with manual shift gate. Cabin a little shorter than the competition, but makes up for it in width. Open greenhouse, very airy. Highly raked profile - with alloys & side sills, it makes most midsizes look boring. Overall best value in 4 door midsizes. Paid <$16K after $2K rebates, plus taxes. Much better value than Korean & US midsizes. $5K+ cheaper than equivalent Accord/Camry.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>- Convenient steering wheel controls - Aggressive style - looks fast when parked - Terrific 17" alloys - Great stopping power with 4 wheel disc ABS - Intuitive driving controls - Nice handling, low body roll - Tight steering, taut suspension - Quiet cabin, little wind/road noise - Great resale value.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have driven many vehicles and the Mazda 6, by far, is one of the most fun rides I have been in! The use of space works really well for me and everything is user-friendly. If you are looking for something to ride in, look elsewhere, because this is one you will want to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th Mazda; out of those four this is my second Mazda 6. I opted out of my 2006 sedan and into a 2007 hatchback because I like the look of the hatchback better. After shopping other brands (from Nissan and Toyota, to Mercedes and BMW) I decided to stick with Mazda. It's simply a sporty looking car at a great price, loaded with options you would get nickel and dimed for on other brands. I couldn't be happier with Mazda #4. The Volcanic red looks great on the road. :-)</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a car built for teenagers, not for a big (not fat) man over 50. Real world driving does not require seats that pinch your legs and shoulder blades to the point of pain. Red lights on the dash at night may be cool in a fighter jet but if you've become far sighted you will not be able to focus on them. Don't expect to carry any hanging clothes because the hook is too close to the drivers seat and the air bag won't work if you hang things on the grab handle. Does anybody really have room for this totally insane key on a keyring? Besides, $250 to get another, can you say ripoff? And the mileage isn't as good as they say either. I'll unload this turkey even if it costs me thousands!</TEXT>
