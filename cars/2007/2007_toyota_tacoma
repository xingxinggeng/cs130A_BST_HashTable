<TEXT>First Toyota truck I've owned. I've owned a Frontier and a Ranger in the past. The Tacoma is a little better than the Frontier and a lot better than the Ranger, if you can get over the price difference. My Access Cab 4 cyl. is good on gas, but is underpowered even with a manual trans. First gear seems to be geared too low and hard to find at times when rolling at lower speeds. The exterior design is OK, with the stock wheels and tires too small for the well area The interior is nicely laid out with plenty of leg room for tall drivers. The radio is a little weak and the access cab area seating is too straight up for a comfortable ride. Overall, quality is good, just needs more 4cyl power.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Front cabin space especially for taller drivers. Composite bed liner with adjustable tie-downs.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this truck for a little over two years now. Traded in a horrible piece of GM junk (2000 Pontiac firebird), needed a truck as I lived in a very rural area where trucks are a necessity. Reliability has been through the roof, especially compared to all of the GM cars and trucks that we have owned over the years. I went with the absolute base model with auto trans as the only option but fit and finish is still excellent along with a plethora of standard features. It doesn't even feel like a truck with the elegant but tough looking interior and almost car like handling. GM should've taken note long ago or they wouldn't be in such dire straits. Overall I am very pleased. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ext/Int design, 6 cup holders, 26mpg, lots of storage, paint quality, standard Air and CD player, handling, copious leg and head room, stain proof seats, absolutely no problems at 40K miles, excellent headlight visibility, engine is easy and simple to work on if you do your own servicing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this truck brand new over two years ago and I drive it for work every day. The Composite bed is a great feature as well as the power outlet in the bed. I didn't have a generator and it powered some basic items in my house for a couple days after a recent storm. The factory tires ride a little rough but have pretty good reliability. The stereo could be a little better. I love the design on the interior and exterior. Gas mileage is great. I usually average around 21-22 miles per gallon. Towing is ok but my 16' ski boat dogs it down a little. Unfortunately the bed dents easily like my last Tacoma. The front bumper should be chrome instead of plastic as well. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a Nissan Pathfinder that had a 3.5 litre and never got over 16 mpg. This Toyota gets 20 mpg with a 4.0 litre. I have a TRD package so the bilstein shocks help the ride when I pull my 24 foot boat. The limited slip diff works well on slippery ramps.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'll start by saying that I've owned many Toyotas over the years and have been very satisfied with every one but this one. After 18k miles the engine began to knock loudly (piston wobble) and the tranny will kick after every stop (driveline lash). These traits all called "normal" by Toyota. These trucks do not represent the quality the brand has developed through the years. If you can live with a truck that makes a nasty knock at idle, shifts through the auto gearbox after a stop...only to thump you after finally finding first gear, chasing wheel balance due to the hub offset being whacked and always having steering wheel shimmy; this might be the truck for you.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The truck looks great and initial quality was super. Good power and nice driving character. The back seat is usable. Good towing capacity. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It's a jack of all trades vehicle. Plenty of room for the kids. Hauls all my stuff. Decent mileage for commuting. Has a somewhat bouncy ride but it's a truck and truth be told does ride better than most other trucks I have ridden in. Has really light and easy steering. Real easy to drive. The transmission is a dream. Smooth shifting and usually grabs just the right gear. You can slap the stick for quick acceleration. Tows my boat very easily.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall it's a nice truck. Very comfortable, good power and lots of features. The stock suspension would bottom out with a load (400 lb motorcycle in the bed) but there is a service bulletin out to upgrade the suspension if you actually use it as a truck. Gas mileage could be a little better. I average 16-17 MPG, mixed driving and topped out at 20.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got the 07 Tacoma and love it. It drives better than my Firebird I had before it. Only knock is the gas mileage is not what I expected it to be. Also cruise control takes some getting used to. I would definitely recommend this truck to anyone. You must get a cold air intake and magnaflow muffler installed. It improves gas mileage and power and makes a great engine perform even better. Plus it is easy to install and fairly cheap.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck is a very smooth ride, has plenty of power and is very comfortable on long trips. Visibility is great, you can see all around very well.The truck handles well at higher speeds when changing lanes and can be thrown around at lower speeds without feeling like your going to roll it over. The main thing wrong with this truck (mine anyway) is that at around 70 mph the front end seems to lift up and it loses stability and steering feel. A windy day and getting around some tractor trailers will make you have to really pay attention to what its doing. Strangely putting on more speed seems to improve this handleing defect. Seems to have a lot if wind noise coming off the outside mirrors.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable, roomy, powerful. I get 19.6 mph doing normal driving combined city and highway. Get about 16.5 driving on a trip when cruising at 80-85. Can get 21 if you baby it. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got the SR5 package. Only a couple days old, but this is a great great great vehicle. Drives great, wonderful design elements, and Toyota reliability. Compared to my girlfriend's 2006 Lexus IS250 - the Tacoma drives like the truck version: nimble and comfortable with a lift and bouncier shocks. Comfortable in heavy street and freeway traffic in LA. Everything feels solid and well put together. And something like 9 cup holders!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Responsive engine, drives like a luxury car turned truck, very comfortable interior, world class design all around. Plenty of behind/below seat compartments for tools and whatnot... even came with a flashlight holder for my Maglite. Included cleats in bed rails are a nice touch. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After having owned several toyotas in the past I'm somewhat disappointed. 1) Idle indictates only around 600 rpm; however vehicle lunges and you find yourself "riding" the brakes. This is especially uneasy in stop and go traffic. 2) Brakes have a "spongy feel" and require a lot brake pedal force. 3) When driving with hand on the automatic transmission shift lever, centrifugal force when making a right turn will cause the shift lever to move from the "D" (drive) to "4" (gear) automatically. 4) Seat position is too low. No adjustment. 5) Steering wheel radio controls designed top/bottom (together) rather than left/right (separated). This causes you to take your eyes of road to use controls. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased, but the test drive sold this vehicle. I was ready to buy the Frontier, a nicely-priced '07 "mgr.'s special" and decided I owed myself the test drive in the latest Taco. I have never owned either brand before. Traded a Sube, still have an old 318 Dakota. The Fronty was a good truck but this blew it away in my opinion. I greatly prefer the adult interior styling and the overall road feel. Power was excellent and felt more controlled in street conditions than brand N. A very sophisticated pickup truck. Did not want the fuel and complexity of 4WD, or cute lettering on the side, so took the straight 4x2 dbl cab with the l/b. Long bed rode better than the short.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine. The interior, control layout, and styling overall. Comfortable driver seating. Sliding rear window. Nice bedliner. Decent rear passenger room. Great ride and handling. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Actually went to the dealer to purchase a RAV4 to replace the wife's older RAV4. She said she wanted to test drive the Tacoma, and the rest is history. We didn't see the need for the offroad model and are very satisfied with the truck. I think a big plus with the wife is sitting higher than a RAV. Visibility is great. it drives very smoothly and shifts beautifully too. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It doesn't have as much hp as the frontier or ridgeline. However it tows more, has a higher payload rating and accelerates better than both of them. All the while it gets better gas mileage. Off road it is tough yet comfortable. The tacoma is the best compact truck out there period. It is expensive. You certainly get the value for what you are paying however a frontier becomes much more lucrative when it is $7k less.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The drive and ride on this vehicle is very good. The transmission shifts good and is smooth in shifting. The brakes seem to be very responsive and firm. After the fact of purchase I found out that the plugs needed to be changed every 15000 miles. I really find that unacceptable. I changed them and restored the gas mileage back in the 18-20 mpg range. The Tacoma needs the timing chain changed out at 100000 miles. I find that unacceptable. I bought this vehicle for low maintenance costs. I don't think this will happen.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a new new Tacoma PreRunner after testing a 2006 Tundra. I was pleasantly impressed with the Tacoma styling and the handling, particularly when compared to its big brother. My only disappointment (and it is minor at this time) is the mileage of the automatic being rated at 6 miles/gallon on the highway less than the 5 speed standard Tacoma version. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I am particularly impressed with the worksmanship of the vehicle and the handling characteristics. Based on a couple other truck builders I investigated, the Tacoma won hands-down.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I thought my wife's 2001 Acura TL was quick but the engine of this Tacoma is impressive when power is necessary. Very fast! Rides like a truck which I enjoy but is still very smooth and comfortable to travel. Decent room for passengers in the rear although a little tight if you have tall people up front. Very nice interior although I've noticed a tendency to inadvertently push the steering wheel radio controls during turns. Overall a great looking and great performing truck. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked around a lot before I bought my Tacoma. I had Chevys and GMCs, too! I had three Dodges. This is the best overall truck I have ever owned. The pickup of the v6 is great. My fuel economy is getting better (18.5) as of 1,000 mile mark. The quality of the paint, interior, all around looks is overwhelming compared to some other car company models. This Tacoma is nice to drive and comfortable too! It just looks good. Indigo Ink Blue! 6 CDs in radio is great. The sound of the radio is real quality.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a 2003 VW GTI for this truck, as we needed a more family-friendly vehicle. Bought with TRD Sport Pkg#1. Truck looks great, handles great, fun to drive. There are some minor design issues that would make a difference. Looks awesome with hood protector, stainless tube steps, and Lund tonneau cover. Love the 115v power outlet in the bed, but worried that composite bed material will scratch very easily. Need to find some carpet or something to line the bed with. Also wish you could get a factory sunroof in double cab models. Like any vehicle, not perfect, but pretty darn good, and hope the reliability is as good as our Sienna.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great looks, especially in Silver Streak Mica with the hood scoop from the TRD package, and the Toyota hood protector... looks really sharp. Cabin comfortable, decent turning radius, good ride (but never lets you forget you're in a truck!) Like the offroad look on a 2WD truck.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my third Toyota truck. I've had an '86, '99, and this '07. It rides well, gets the same gas mileage as my last one and better than my old '86 four cylinder, but with more power. Engine is smooth, quiet and powerful. Transmission shifts smoothly. Very comfortable inside. Fold down rear "seatlets" work great for holding ice chests for camping. On the down side: The rear end bottoms out easily under load. Can be remedied with add-a-leafs or air bags. Not much ground clearance, I may get a lift kit.I liked the old lever-type 4X4 range shifter better. New electronic dial type range selector works reliably, but not as smooth and predictably as an actual lever did. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power mirrors/doorlocks. Lumbar support. Single pane slider window works better than old dual panes. 400W power inverter works great when camping. Integrated fog lights are nice, a little upward adjustment helps for range. Diff lock's great. Oil filter and oil drain plug positions are wonderful!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased a replacement for my 2001 Jeep Wrangler intending to do better than 12 mpg. The Toyota delivers about 18 mpg highway (thanks to the terrible new corn fuels that are terrible for the environment anyway) and 12 mpg city. After about 7 months of ownership, my check engine light came on. $6,500 worth of warranty work and 4 trips later, it is off. My dealer kindly loaned me a fully loaded Avalon to drive in the mean-time. I hate the plastic bed, but I'm certain the decreased weight saves on gas mileage. The looks are ok, I prefer 4th generation Tacomas (2001-2004) over the 5th. Paint chips like crazy on my silver model. The painted plastic bumpers, etc are a bad idea. </TEXT>

It can climb steep inclines, narrow enough to get through the trees, light enough to get over the mud, and a great turning radius for a truck.

<TEXT>My best purchase "ever". Drive 80+ miles daily, and recently slowed down to 55 with the cruise control on. Best mpg so far is 26 mpg @ 55 mph! Usually, I'm @ 22-23 mpg, but I consistently drive under 60 mph. Recent valve rattle is a concern and I will check for technical service bulletins. Have not missed an oil change, and it cannot be "normal" for a new engine to rattle! Toyota can be tough, but be persistent and do not accept defects as "normal". I demanded an engine rebuild @ 108,000 miles on a Camry due to an oil sludge problem caused by an engine re-design in order to receive a higher EPA rating for the 2.4L engine. The dealer rebuilt the engine, but it took serious effort. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Trans. Rattle</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Bought the reg. cab 4x4 for utility and reliability. The truck has lived up to my expectation except for the 5 spd manual trans. The trans. has rattled when in neutral since day one. Rattle is tolerable except when A/C compressor is running. Had dealer inspect, but they claim it is normal. If I wanted a truck that rattled I would have saved some money and not bought new. I would not buy this truck again do to this problem. If you are going to buy a Tacoma don't get the 5 spd. I haven't heard anything about the 6spd or auto. There is no point in spending extra money for a Toyota if they are going to build them like Fords in California.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I think the Toyota Tacoma V6 is great strong Motor and the 6 speed m/t works fine (I find the oil changes very easy to do, I love the location of the oil filter). But, I have had some problems with chipping paint also. Furthermore the seating position is a little low. Also no iPod connection, my company work van has one. Also I wish the Tacoma had pop out wing windows (my 2004 Tacoma did). The Tacoma has great looks and it will be easy to sale. I suggest getting the tow package (6500lbs), the Tacoma is strong and can handle towing and off road driving. Its easy to beat up any truck, but in 10 years this truck will be still on the road (reliable).</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Tacoma and 4th Toyota. I knew this was the only truck I was going to buy the only thing was to decide a color (black). There is a lot of storage. The storage under and behind the rear seats is beyond great. The composite bed is much needed. Although it can be slick. The engine power is excellent and after 17K miles I get 21 hwy and 18 mixed driving. I have no complaints except the paint scratches very easy. Toyota needs to address this along with the 17" sport wheels that have a pitting problem in the finish.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very nice truck with an excellent ride. This is my third Tacoma and by far the best. I use my truck mainly for personal transportation and I bet I represent a large number of buyers. With that in mind Toyota should make available more creature comforts, i.e., power seats, heated mirrors, a sunroof, auto temp and leather seats. The tire monitor system is useless, it only indicates you have low tire pressure but doesn't tell you which tire. The system GM uses gives you a readout of the tire pressure in each tire, a much more useful system. Even with the short comings I'll buy this truck again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So, the truck now has 16k miles. Other than the initial axle problem things have been OK. I monitor every tank and the truck was 16 city and 18.5 hwy with canopy until I put new tires on which dropped me 2 mpg (265 70 17) 4wd works flawlessly. The cruise control is still useless-surges gears-and seatbelt and back-up warning quit working. Speaking of tires, despite claims you CAN NOT go wider than 265 without rubbing, even w/ 3" lift unless you replace the rims and sensors-big $$. Smoking problem has cleared with 3rd synthetic oil change - whew.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Extremely comfortable, great torque, acceleration and visibility. Great body styling-this is a big "small" truck</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Did an immense amount of research before purchasing. It wasn't even close when all was said and done. If you are looking for a 4 door compact pick up this is your baby. 239 hp in the V6 is more than enough, and avg. 19-20 mpg overall. The interior and ride is superior to competetors. The appearance was aesthetically appealing as well. Toyota has a long history of quality reliability. I previously owned Ford and Nissan pick ups, and the Toyota is my favorite by far. I plan on keeping this one for many years. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Having owned Ford long beds, this truck is far superior in every way except power on hills. I chose the I4 Prerun for value reasons and it's lived up its name. Hauling a motorcycle on a hill with the manual tran at 70 was not a problem nor has getting 22-27 (26-7 if you drive speed limit; my overall avg. is 23.5) on the highway for my daily commute. I've driven 8 hours straight (one stop for gas) and enjoyed comfort comparable to the Accord; cruise control is a must! Also, the midrange power from 70-85 has been surprisingly responsive for those days when you're in a rush. IMO, this truck is a long term keeper.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased this truck to get better mileage than my old 1999 Dodge Dakota. So far gas mileage has been terrible ( I am a careful driver!), the engine is under powered and the rough downshifting on even slight inclines makes the cruise control useless.

<TEXT>Purchased new 07 Toy to replace a 03 Honda Oddy after much research. Wanted 4 wheel drive. We love driving it when it runs. It has been back to the dealership 4 times and they can't figure out what is wrong. It just will not start. We park it, go to bed and get up in the morning to a truck that won't start. We really like the back country but now we are afraid to go there as we never know whether our toy will run or not. This is our 4th Tacoma, so we thought we were getting quality.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Everything has been upgraded from what I was used to. Coming from my previous 1999 version of this same truck, the 2007 version is longer, higher, wider, stronger and smarter. I am glad that they have made standard the 4x4 mode being switchable from the dash and also improved rust preventation under the chasis by using thicker steel, other alloys, and rust inhibiting paint. Standard features I would of thought would be extra (bedliner, CD, AC, etc.) There is no comparison out there. Nissan, Ford, Mazda, Dodge, and Chevy can only hope to ever match the quality, dependability, durability, and plain sleek/smart design of the Tacoma. The Toyota Tacoma continues to define the small truck genre.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was looking at the Frontier and the Tacoma. I decided on the Tacoma because of the superior space in the rear seat and Toyota's responsible tradition of workmanship and durability. Not sure if it matters but the battery is huge. I have a double cab short box SR5 Off Road Package and there is plenty of room for adults in the rear seat. As for the problem mentioned by the Editors of this site regarding the low seats, it took my lower back 2 weeks to get used to it but now I love it, all good things take some getting used to. The truck handles great off-road, better than I imagined. This truck is a small tank! It handles curbs at 30-40mph no problem ! oops!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a perfect truck. After owning two Mazda "Rangers" and selling my beloved Jeep Cherokee I vowed to buy a full size truck until I took a spin in the '07 Tacoma. I love this truck. The V6 that gets knocked for being loud is music to my ears. The first 2000 miles on the truck were on a trip to Moab and the truck did not disappoint. It is a joy to drive on and off road. The TRD suspension is more than a cool sticker, it really works. The truck has plenty of room for the wife and two kids. The dealer even installed a 2.5" lift (sold!). This truck is rugged, solid and fast. 7,500 miles (at least 800 off road) and no problems. Did I say I like my truck?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove a previous model year Tacoma and the difference is night and day. I always wanted one and finally broke down after my last vehicle died. The thing that surprised me the most is the outstanding turning radius. I have put about 13k on it since I got it in December last year and have had no issues. All around this is a reliable, comfortable, sleek, and fun drive. Great acceleration. Great handling. Could not be more happy with any other truck. My friends envy me! :)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Even though I have a base model with no options on it, it does not bother me, and I am all about options! It has everything you need.

<TEXT>This is the first pickup I've owned and I generally have high marks. I imagine it's as capable as any other in its class, and IMO it rides extremely comfortably. One major disappointment is the chintziness inside. My gearshift knob swims in place, while the gearshift itself shimmies endlessly in the front gears (1-3-5). There's also a cheap plastic compartment next to the steering column that doesn't shut properly (and I've never used it). I've also been disappointed by the fuel efficiency. While it reports 23/28, I have yet to get anywhere close to 20 mpg from a tank. From a drive standpoint, the manual 5-speed seems essential for responsive on hills, turns, tough on-ramps, etc.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The access cab is perfectly handy. My 1-year old daughter loves to ride perfectly secure in her car seat on the passenger side. I love the bed cleats (or whatever they're called)- I'm always sliding them around (very easily) to bungy down different stuff I carry around.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At 6k the LF wheel bearings, front axle and roter needed to be replaced. (never off-road or accident)Cruise control is useless-jumps gears constantly. Mileage OK at consistant 16.5-18 with a canopy. Blows occasional smoke on startup which got a little better with synthetic oil. Watch for sludge build-up on these motors. Check warranty carefully -Toyota will not look at this problem unless you are losing a quart of oil every 1k miles. Fingers crossed mine is not one of these problems. Thank god I had not installed the lift kit and voided the warranty!</TEXT>

While I loved my full size, I love the improved fuel economy and the great pickup my V6 has. It has all the creature comforts you need and is comfortable. I am 6'4" and have no problem being comfortable in the front seat, although I wouldnt recommend the jump seats in the rear for any adult over 6'. Could use a little more padding on the seats, but I love the fold flat feature. Makes it easy to load groceries or bulky items. I love the track system in the bed. Makes it easy to find the best tie down spot for my load. Altogether an excellent buy. Will not be disappointed with this truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Toyota Tacoma offers a reliable vehicle, but option packages were not flexible. Wanted cruise control but that only comes with extended cab. Color and other options very limited. Design is cookie cutter. Lots of extra holes in the dash for accessory switches that will never be used and so on. I4 engine is underpowered making it necessary to manually shift between 3rd gear and drive. Cruise control is useless on roads even with slight inclines. The transmission downshifts constantly with a very jerky motion. Driver and passengers are constantly being thrown back and forth. Even slight side winds whip truck around on highway. Fuel economy not even close to what I thought it would be.</TEXT>

I have 6k miles on mine and have an off and on noise that happens at 75-80 (dealer can't diagnose 'cause they can only drive it up to 70), front dash rattles, passenger door rattles and has had to be towed as it wouldn't start (Thank God I purchased the extended service plan otherwise I would have been really irked paying for towing on a 3 month old truck).

<TEXT>This is my first Toyota and it is quite a change from my Ranger. It is bigger, faster, and gets better gas mileage. The back seat is great for my three kids and the leg room is reasonable for an adult. It could use a bit more brake, maybe rear disks. The paint has a great sheen and very little orange peel compared to other vehicles in its segment. The engine compartment is cavernous and there is actually room to work if you ever need to get to the coil/plugs or the alternator. Not like the shoehorned engine compartments I am used to from past experience. Overall I am very happy with the truck's performance and look. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Full four doors and a usable back seat for the family is the best part. The fuel economy is 20.3 so far but I am not thru the break in period yet so it should get better.

<TEXT>I looked at many different makes in switching back to a truck from cars and SUVs the past 6 years, and the Tacoma was hands down the best. I was looking for a 4 cyl 4x4 that could handle the everyday drive, some off-roading, and some light hauling. This more than meets my needs, and it's the best looking one out there! The build quality is amazing. It's one of the most solid feeling vehicles I've owned (car or truck). The bigger interior in the last redesign is amazing. I went with the Indigo Ink, SR5 package, and tire upgrade. Love the ground clearance and cannot wait to test this out off-road. MPG have been 21.7 for all city driving. Looking forward to many years of driving my Taco!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Besides the looks I'd have to say interior size and build quality. This truck just feels solid!! For being an access cab, this truck is huge inside. Very nice layout of the dash and controls. I'm very impressed!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first truck! I test drove F150 FX4, Nissan Frontier, and Titan but decided to get Toyota Tacoma in the end. I liked the F150 and Titan but I just couldn't buy either one because of gas mileage. The Frontier truck was good also but didn't have many configurations. Tacoma was built like a truck and runs like a truck too. If you want to get a truck that runs like a car, stay away from this one. However, if you are after quality, this one is for you. It lacks (4cyl 4X4) horsepower to accelerate fast on the highway but it handles sharp curves like a car. At high speed around 70 mph, the truck makes quite a bit of engine noise. The exterior is very stylish and interior is well designed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good look and functional design. Sits up high, yet very stable on sharp curves.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This truck has exceeded my expectations. Excellent power, torque and 4WD function for this size vehicle in standard highway environment hazards ,i.e. snow, ice, rain. I have not been off road with it but it does tow boats effortlessly. Solid, somewhat noisy ride, but delivers the mileage advertised on the sticker which is great .</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4.0 V6 VVI motor is a torque machine and a smooth runner. All the motor this truck will ever need and matches gearing perfectly with the locking rear differential and 4WD. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 4th new Toyota, 2 were 4Runners and a Tundra. This vehicle is the right size and with the double cab and enough bed room for the weekend yard work, kayak, surfboard hauler etc., this truck is perfect. I went with the 4 wheel drive and TRD Sport package w/17' wheels and the ride is great! Everything compared it is hard to beat the quality and interior layout. Try to have everything from the factory re: running boards, roof rack, and not dealer installed if you can help it. I work with BMW and for cars they are 2nd to none, but for my off time this Tacoma is hard too beat!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 6 speed manual is a poor design, too many gears too close together to be of any use. 6th gear can easily be driven at 50 mph, what happened to an overdrive gear? The cigarette lighter that is disabled with the ignition off is a terrible design. What were they thinking, a cellphone charger will drain a 35lb battery?? Maybe in a few weeks! Why not engineer disabling when the battery gets low? By the way, don't think about charging a cellphone if you are doing stop and go. It really messes up the charging. Gas mileage is about 17 mph for highway driving on the V6. I have not heard of anyone doing better. The 110w outlet is useless, not enough juice to do anything useful. </TEXT>

<TEXT>There is a problem with Toyota paint on these pickups. The water based paint chips very easily. I thought I bought a good dependable truck only to find chipping paint after only 1000 miles of around town driving. I like the truck but the paint problem spoils it for me. Buyer beware. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Well it has been one week since I pick up my Toyota Tacoma 4x4 TRD Dbl Cab. I have to admit that I love it. It is well built and very comfortable. Today I towed a trailer with 2 yards of wet topsoil and I almost forgot it was back there. Great power and fuel economy (I hope, I'm still on the first tank of gas). After driving a Chevy S-10 ZR2 for 130,000 miles I was not sure about a Toyota, but it had everything I was looking for, appeared well built and the price compared to equal vehicles was reasonable. It is like driving a car with all the abilities of a truck. Our two Saint Bernards love the back seat and it has enough toys to keep me busy for a while.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle for hauling mountain bikes, light yard work, camping and the occasional light towing job. Thus far, I have not been disappointed. Everything is well laid out and the storage is awesome. Plenty of power to enter Houston freeways with ease or tackle any jeep road. Purchase the sound shield and paint shield. Paint seems a little thin and scratches easily but hey, it's a truck! Highly recommended. Serves my purposes and then some. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the storage bins and the composite bed. Rail system is great with fork bike mount or ski rack. 4WD is idiot proof. 13 cupholders... don't know why but it's good to put water in on those long trips. Stance is agressive and looks great with the black brushguard. Gas mileage good for a truck.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had a large arrray of cars and trucks and this by far beats them all. I do a lot of off road driving and playing around in the mud, and I have yet to be able to get this thing stuck. When I took delivery of this truck I left the lot and headed on a 2000 mi road trip, most comfortable ride and great fuel economy. Does great at highway speeds and around town. I will never get rid of this truck, it will stay in the family for the rest of its life and guess what, it is a Toyota. It's going to be around for a while!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall great truck. First new truck I have purchased and so far, no major disappointments. Ride gets a little "squirrely" when driving on grooved concrete highway, doesn't seem to stay on track. Ride gets bouncy when empty, but not sure what happens when it is loaded. So far, I've only driven it empty. My old truck was a full-size crew cab, and this is a welcome change when buying fuel. So far, getting around 21 mpg, and haven't used cruise control yet. I'm hoping to improve to about 23 mpg. Plenty of power, but I haven't really tested it yet (still in break in). I'm getting used to the shift configuration, and should have it down soon, but it is not what I'm familiar with. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I replaced my 12 yr old Toyota pickup with an 07 Tacoma double cab TRD Sport longbed. Nothing wrong with my old truck, just wanted something bigger and with more options/power. Only had it a month but I can tell I will be driving for many years. Decent power, smooth ride. Only problem I had was fitting it in my garage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my defective Chevrolet Colorado in on a new Tacoma after GM wouldn't stand behind their product. I wish I would have looked at the Tacoma 2 years ago. The interior quality beats Chevy hands down, as does the ride and lack of road noise. There is also no comparison of the stereo system, Toyota beats Chevy without question. The mileage on the 2.7 4 cyl. 4X4 Tacoma has been fantastic. The mileage during the first 3000 miles has been 23 - 24 mpg with about 50% highway driving. I am very happy with my Tacoma.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Picked up my new Tacoma this week and it's quite a truck. Loads of standard equipment. Love the extra doors on the access cab. Terrific factory stereo. Smooooth transmission. Plenty of power for my needs. Sold my old Tacoma SR-5 with 170K trouble free miles to get the new one. It took all of 3 hrs. from the time I placed the ad until the cash was in hand. If this new truck works out as well as the old one, I'll be a happy camper. Don't know why you'd consider any other small truck. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new truck, 4dr 4WD 6cyl 5spd Auto, with Off Road Suspension Pkg and Tow Pkg (6500lbs). Ride/suspension is better than anything I would expect from a truck. Very quick when needed and haven't climbed with it yet but plenty of torque @ 266 ft lbs. Quiet smooth ride, great steering/ handling/ shift and great sound system w/upgrd stereo/6cd + subwfr. Plenty of front and back legroom. Quality vs. cost = great value. 18/21 mpg! If you want a compact truck w 4wd, plenty of space, hp, tow capacity, mpg, and quality then Tacoma is best choice for a few 1000 more. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4wd + 4dr + 6cyl(proven) 236 hp/266 ft/lbs torque + off road + 6500 lbs tow capacity combination with great styling and mpg is the best combination of features I could find. Awesome rear seat/cargo combinations with cool under and behind seat storage compartments.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After having a Chevy S-10 and always wanting a Toyota, I can not be happier. I recently pulled a U-Haul trailer from PA to Florida, it made it seem like I had nothing on the back. My bud, pulled the same with an S-10. I pretty much could have dusted him. He had problems with hills, and I didn't. I also got better gas mileage, which is always a plus. I just like having a truck, even though this is the smaller model, it still rocks, has great power for a little engine. This is my second Toyota, I will never again own anything else. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm very satisfied with the Taco, lives up to the reviews, and would buy it all over again. The visibility is great, and 5 adults fit comfortably. It feels solid, and handles well both on streets & freeways. My goals were to get a vehicle with better than average reliability that rode a little higher off the ground and the Taco fit the bill as a great investment. I'm a happy first time Toyota owner & first time truck owner. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving all the midsize trucks, Toyota was my pick. I would do it again even though there a few complaints, the primary one being that it has 3 or 4 impossible to find intermittant rattles, each being heard only when hitting its own unique road bump. Perhaps the firm riding Off Road package causes some of the problem. Also, a small nitpick: what's with the cloth arm rest on the door that will look soiled within a year? This is a truck, not an Avalon! Additionally, the engine fan causes excessive noise, even during fast idle warmup. Finally, there is no tailgate lock. After 3500 miles there has not been any warranty work required.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet ride. Great looking interior. Ther sport seats are perfect. Powerful, smooth and economical engine that gets 20 mpg in urban/surburban driving. Exceptionally smooth auto transmission that is into high gear by 35 mph, helping maximize city mpg. Lots of storage space under and behind rear seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After a month of thorough research I narrowed it down to the Frontier and Tacoma. The Tacoma was roomier. It does have some spongy brakes that need to get used to (TRD 4x4). Interior is an A+! Good power and ride. Very comfortable seating. I have owned Chevys all my life. This is the first Toyota that I have purchased. Sold my 04 Colorado Z71 crew cab. This blows it away hands down. Even though I bought the fully loaded Colorado, it just feels cheap to drive when compared to the Tacoma. Great job Toyota! Some additional lighting for the 4x4 and various other switches would help. Also, I had to order a cabin filter. Toyota makes the slot for one but does not place one in there? C'mon. </TEXT>
