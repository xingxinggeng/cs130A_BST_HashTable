<TEXT>I bought a Toyota SCION TC for my daughter, I did not buy an extended warranty because of the 60,000 mile 5year warranty that came with the vehicle.The car started to give her problems with a leak into the passenger compartment.With 2 visits they finally stopped the leak. Next came the blower motor that failed.By this time my car had gone by the 60,000 miles that was covered under the warranty.At 73,000 miles my engine failed.I called Toyota who offered to reimburse me for $500.00. A new engine is over $4000.00. In conclusion, I feel there could have been a compromise to this situation. Thanks for listening.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car to replace my cavalier. I absolutely loved everything about it. It was cute, fun to drive, the layout inside the car was great. Very spacious. I owned it up until today (October 1, 2009). I was hit by an SUV going 55 mph on the passengers side, and smashed into a guardrail. The car was totaled, but the safety features on it really saved my life. I got out of the car with a few scratches and a busted lip from the airbag. So I will give all plus's safety wise. So any concerned parents for safety check it out. A beautiful good quality car, great sound system, spacious, and a great car to drive!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the space in the car.The sound system is perfect, I love having the music cranked up. AC worked great in the southern Florida heat.The heat worked well in the cold Indiana weather. I love the overall look of the car. Safe, reliable, never had any problems with it, overall a good buy for the $</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>DO NOT BUY A SCION. I have a 2007 scion 3.0 with the third supercharger and let me say it is a piece of junk and dealing with scion themselves is horrible that is why the saying "you get what you pay for" is soooooo tru. I paid $4500 for a s.c.that give you only 40 more h.p. and everything in the car just falls apart and when you tell scion what goes wrong they just point at you and laugh. So word of advice. DO NOT BUY ONE!!!!! TRUST ME>>></TEXT>
<FAVORITE>looks beautiful and its fun at first until it starts making a bunch of noises. Such as wind noises because of the poor quality of the seals in the glass.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I guess we didn't do our homework. When it rains or snows we do not use this car at all. You are all over the road. We wanted a good dependable car all year round, but not with this. We even bought winter tires and it did not help the problem. We didn't realize when it is a high performance car there is not much weight to the car abd thus you are all over the road when the weather turns bad. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Now, first off, I am sick of people complaining on here about the mileage, yes, it is a small car, and the Corolla does get better mileage, but this car has a 2.4L engine, and the Corolla has a 1.8L on 95% of them. And, most people complaining are driving it to hard, that's the problem. Secondly, complaining about rattles? Well, when you buy a cheap compact car....that is what you get, thats why Mercedes cost a lot. This car gives you what you need, a GREAT sound system, PHENOMENAL Wheels, DAZZLING looks, SURPRISING Space and Comfort, and 60 cubic feet of space when the rear seats fold down flat....it is practical and sporty. This car DESTROYS the Civic Si, because the Si is more expensive..</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound System, Perfect stock wheels, Great interior and exterior looks, comfortable seats, intelligently layed out interior design, flat folding rear cargo area, 4 Wheel ABS for safety, and 7 airbags for safety. Oh, and the HANDLING!!!</FAVORITE>

Can't find out any info on the older models and the paint on the 2005-2006 tc I have the black color. The car is fun to drive very peppy and has all the things I need in a car. I recommend the car always when asked about it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Turns around curves good. Zippy.. holds it's own, passes well. Black cherry color has got many compliments. It's an all around good car for going to/from work. I wouldn't drive it in the deep snow. On long trips the seats killed my back. Not much room inside for toting alot of luggage on a long trip - else all good. After 57K no problems with the mechanical. 30mpg highway</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my car for myself for my 18th birthday and I love it. I was debating between the tC and the Civic but once I was in the tC I knew I had to have it. I love the radio controls on the steering wheel and the whole design of the car. I have to agree with some reviews here that say it is a little hard to stay under the speed limit with this car =). I have had a few tires issues with this car. Had to replace 2 in about 2 years but overall i am extremely pleased with this car</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really like the way the outside of the car has been styled and when I got in i quickly fell in love with the way the car was put together. I like how the dash wraps around the driver making all of the controls easily accessible. the standard features of the car are awesome; moon/sunroof, power windows and locks, stereo controls on the steering wheel, and alloy wheels.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like how the car comes standard with so many features, yet there are a lot of upgrades and other things that you can do to the car, even from TRD if you wanted to go down that road. I also still love the interior and exterior style. It has a lot of motor and design, and "bang for the buck" over all.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 2007 Scion tC. It drives so smoothly. I caught myself driving 85 MPH on the freeway and didn't even know it. It is so quiet and smooth. The gas is very touchy though. I have a manual so It is a little different than what I am used to. I think who ever buys this vehicle will be very happy with it. I know I am.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new Scion tC. I was thinking about getting the xB but the more I looked at it the more it resembled a lunch box...so I'm glad I opted for the better model. The tC is very roomy and comfortable, has good gas mileage, and a great sound system (I got the upgrade). I love the panoramic roof even though I have to rain-x the whole top of the car. I love the sporty design with the pedestal spoiler (a must, the car looks weird w/o it), and I can throw my massage table right in with no problem with the huge area of storage with the hatchback design.

<TEXT>I wanted Toyota quality, what I got was Toyota cheap! This car has too much plastic (for example, its all along the sides below the door and quarter panels), too much emphasis on youth chic and not enough hallmark Toyota quality. No wonder they invented a new brand. The radio pops whenever you turn it on after a short delay because of poor integration of the factory amplifier option. This occurs on every Scion with a factory installed amp. When I first got it, the radio popped every time I changed stations! It also has cheap sheet metal that pops from the slightest pressure. I thought I was going to dent the hood, hatchback and doors a couple of times when I first waxed it. The whole roof is glass. On the plus side it is fun to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the sporty looks, handling, wheels, 5-speed manual transmission and iPod compatibility (although the implementation is not as good as it could be).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really want to like this car, but I can't help feeling I made a horrible decision here. There's nothing actually WRONG with this car, it's just that after a few months driving it, I've realized that I've just bought a pretty standard economy car, the number one issue being that it's no fun to drive at all. It has good power for such a cheap car, but unfortunately it's suspension is way too soft, it leans too much in corners, and it's isolated from the road like a sedan, instead of a sports coupe. I like to hear some noise and feel some bumps, and I like hard solid suspension so I feel confident in corners. Put the Mazda3's suspension on this car and it'd be perfect for the price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>There is a really nice shine in the bodywork, it's still nice after six months. The short-shifter add-on that I chose isn't bad. It has a nice enough interior (the main thing that makes you forget the car's price). The MP3 stereo is nice - but pretty much standard in all similar cars now anyway. It has very nice standard 17" wheels and tires.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently purchased my 2007 Scion tC, and have been pleasantly surprised. It is not as luxurious as the 2007 Civic, however, it is roomier, and gives the sense of being more "open." I loooove the cabin space, and pick up that this car has. It you drive slowly, you actually average 25-26 mpg on the city. For what I paid, I got a VERY good car! I highly recommend it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have put only 300 miles on the car, but I love it. I drove it for two days with stock shifter and then had a short throw installed. It was the best money I ever spent, it makes a huge difference. I highly recommend this as an upgrade. Also, the strut bar has really stiffened up the front end. The accelerator is touchy and the hydraulic clutch takes a little getting used to. I still haven't mastered it yet. For the money, you cannot beat this car. But I truly think it is for someone who wants a inexpensive sporty car, not a touring vehicle. For those of you who are interested, 75mph = 3,500 RPM so don't be surprised on the freeway when there is probably a little more engine noise then you are used to.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It has a four-cylinder engine that has enough torque to pull you off the line nicely. The short throw shifter is great for quick shifts. It has excellent braking and cornering. The auto-up and auto-down windows on both sides is an amazing feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Driving of the tC is firm and there is plenty acceleration through the entire power band. Its styling is great. It gets good gas mileage even though you are having too much fun in the passing lane. It has an original look about it since not everyone and their mother is driving one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is such a fun car to drive The interior is super comfy and I love the Pioneer system factory that I had installed. You've gotta' love the sunroof and the auto up and down windows.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my premium gas guzzling, visually challenged for driving safety, 2006 Eclipse GT for a 2007 Scion tC and it is simply a great car. It has nearly all of the features of an "upscale Eclipse" minus the aero-kit, which worked itself loose twice in six months causing simply put: poor fit and looks. The Eclipse has more adrenalin but the tC is more consistent overall and has outstanding fuel economy using regular fuel. Its 17 inch wheels and wide rubber make it a gem for handling and turning. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove the Chevy Cobalt SS supercharged, Mazda 3 4-door and 5-door, Nissan Sentra Spec-V, and the Scion tC. I instantly fell in love with the Scion. I was also happy that it is made by Toyota. The resale value is high and it has excellent quality. I also like how you can get exactly the features you want without having to buy some expensive package. The price is phenomenal. I wonder how Toyota can stuff so much into such a great car and still make money on it at less than $18,000. It is so smooth, I feel like I am driving a Lexus. I have no "buyer's remorse" with my car, none.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The acceleration is great. This car has more horsepower and torque than the Honda Civic. The standard 17 inch rims are really nice too. The ride is really smooth and the tires keep traction very well in the rain. Plus, the ladies are really diggin' my new ride. It is an excellent car all around.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was actually planning on buying an xA, and I test drove two of them, but I loved the way the tC looked...and once I saw the inside, I was in love. It's beautifully designed, it absorbs about a million times more shock and the ride is much smoother than the VW Jetta that I traded in for this car. Theres a lot more space on the inside than you would think from looking at the outside of it, and the moonroofs are just perfect. All in all, I feel like I bought a very sporty performance car for about half of what I might expect to pay for one. And Scion has about every warranty extension under the sun; the warranty I got was about $1,100 extra and it covers me for six years completely.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall for the money, the car is quite adequate. The only option I have is side impact airbags. I also had the dealership add the pedestal spoiler and auto dim mirror. The mirror is cool as it throws off a great interior ambiance light that covers the entire center console. Those thinking about the footwell and cupholder lights, forget it and get the mirror. My little brother works at Circuit City and installed a great Double Din Kenwood CD player, adapter so the steering wheel controls work and Sirius...all for less than $400. DO NOT buy the satellite radio from the dealer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It looks like a much more expensive car inside and out. The baby has his own personal sunroof! I love the $17,700 price tag. Dealers are almost afraid of Scion, they will not deviate from their set pricing!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love love my '07 Scion tC. I got Nautica Blue one. I'm in love with the color, it gets crazy looks. It is so fresh so clean. I've been wanting one for about a year and built one online every chance I got. It's my first new car. I had a Chevrolet Caviler, so it's a big change. I havent heard any rattling, but the wind in the back is starting to get to me. Other than that, I love everything about the car. I drive 45 minutes to an hour to work everyday and I love how comfortable it is. This is a great looking car for the ladies. Girls you have to get you one. It's a head turner!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love everything about it. I got the pedestal spoiler, fog lights, and Scion security. iPod capability its a must, As are the rear tail light enhancements. I was going for the sporty look.

<TEXT>The new 2007 Toyota Scion tC is an amazing car. It's greatest feature is how smooth it is. My my Scion is literally as smooth as my friend's '06 2006 BMW 325xi! I live in Utah and drive a ton and the gas mileage is literally shocking. I'll drive a long distance and see that I barely used a quarter tank! Also, the interior and exterior are so cool :D . I love the double sunroof, it allows so much light into the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really researched the car market for about a month and this had to be one of the best cars on the market. It has a nice sleak design that really turns heads. Also, the interior is so clean and very nice. The seats hug to you and make you feel comfortable. Even though there is a bit of a blind spot on the back left and back right, it is not as bad as in most cars. The trunk, while not that big, was bigger then expected and the glove compartment is HUGE. The gauges light up really nicely and the radio is nicely hidden by the sliding door. The sun/moonroof is the best part of the car because no one has seen something like this yet. This is a total chick magnet car. I will be loving this car for a long time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car a little over a month ago with side airbags. Right now have just over a 1,000 miles on it. On three tanks of gas I have averaged 27 mpg. So far it does not have any of the infamous rattles, but sometimes there are some creaks here and there when riding on rough pavement or over bumps. Overall I like the design, comfort, and quality of the interior. Its ride and handling are similar to a modern sporty sedan such as an Accord, I own one - a 2005. Its handling is not as responsive as I would like it to be, compared to my old `98 VW Golf. Its acceleration is near excellent. The clutch is very "touchy-feely" - it took me over a week to get used to it enough such that the take offs are smooth every time without much effort.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It has a compliant and confident ride. I like the MT feel. It has a beautiful exterior and interior design. Hopefully it has the bulletproof Toyota reliability as well. The manual transmission makes it fun to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my tC on Sep 11th, and I regret nothing. This car looks good, goes like a rocket (3rd gear to 5,200 RPM - WOW!), and corners like its on a rail. I added the window tint, pedestal spoiler, TRD lowering springs, strut tower bar, BORLA exhaust and cold air intake to the deal, although I'm still waiting for the intake. It seems the bore for the MAP sensor is too big for the '07 sensor and the dealer estimates a two week to two month wait while Toyota corrects the problem. I intend to get it and I'm saving up for the supercharger too! All in all, this is a great ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought this car a few weeks ago. So far it is great in almost every aspect. The highway gas mileage seems low though (only 28 mpg so far) I am hoping that it gets better.

<TEXT>I have had this car for one week and I am very happy with it. I had a very hard time trying to decide between the tC and the 2007 Honda Civic Coupe EX. I think I made the right decision. The tC just seems to have more character and also has more toys than the Civic. Yes, I gave up some gas mileage, but I currently have a short commute and I think it is worth it. If a long commute was an issue I think I could have chosen the Civic and been happy with it as well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Flint Mica paint - I LOVE this color - it sparkles like crazy in the sun! The two moonroofs and the iPod stero are great (Honda did not have a smooth iPod integration option). The car has a good solid feel to it, which was a concern of mine coming from a VW to a Japanese brand. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Little did I know that after comparing many value priced cars, that I'd pick a Scion tC. First off, I didn't know that Scion means "Decendant" and that it's a decendant company of Toyota. Once that was known, and I had read many GREAT reviews for the 2007 Scion tC, it was time to go test drive one. I traded in a much more expensive sports car on my new silver Scion tC, but it was done for a lower monthly payment and insurance costs, better gas mileage, the ability to use Regular unleaded gas, etc. My first thought when I sat in the driver's seat and closed the door was "Man! This car is built SOLID!" And it is. It wasn't anything like I was expecting - cheapo quality - NOT here! It's a Toyota!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The high quality feel, sporty handling/feel on the road, and the thrill it gives you when you get on the gas - it does have some nice get up and go to it. I like the great gas mileage / fuel economy. The panoramic moonroof (LOVE that) is great. I love the look of the headlights - they look like it means business. I also like the iPod hookup.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What an awesome combination: Toyota quality and total flexibility in options and accessories. I had to "trade down" from an expensive sports coupe to save some money and I thought I would have to settle for some dinky econo box. But I'm so happy with this car I wish I had traded for the Scion long ago. I think the Scion idea of packing a lot of features into the base car and allowing the consumer to pick and choose what accessories they want is THE way to go. I didn't have to overspend to get the stereo system I wanted in this car. I got exactly what I wanted and the value is much better than the Honda Civic, Nissan Versa, and Mazda3 that I test drove and compared it to. Go get one!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>No doubt...the stereo - excellent iPod control, Bazooka 10" sub and screaming tweeters. iPod storage is nicely hidden away and easy to connect. What's not to love?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm 18 years old and this is my first new car. I was been driving a white '98 Ford Explorer for six months before I got this car. So obviously I don't have an enthusiast's experience with cars. I can still say though that this car isn't a Mercedez-Benz, nor an Infiniti G35, nor a BMW Z4 or whatever it's called. The quality isn't even close. However, it's a great car for the price. All the features are nice and the fact that it has a nice list of standard features is what made me get the car. Just don't get it in the black...or else I'll have to start a crazy rumor like the paint corrodes if you get a black tC. =-)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the overall look of the car. It's very sleak. Both the interior and exterior designs are top notch. It's really a nice car. I think a lot of the reviewers here just got their car brand new so they are really excited and just rate every aspect with 10.0.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've just traded my 2005 Silver Streak Mica Scion tC for a 2007 Black Sand Pearl Scion tC. The other "econobox" and "pocket rocket" cars, while trading styling for fuel economy are NOT as practical or good looking as the Scion tC. Pontiac's G5 and Chevrolet's Cobalt lag FAR behind the tC in standards (AND offered options to bring them up to tC standards) and the Honda Civic Si is BOTH over priced AND overrated (been there, did that, NEVER again). NONE are hatchbacks with anything NEAR the STANDARD features offered on the Scion tC! Also, ANY car maker that forces daytime running lights on me (I'm 52 years old and know WHEN to turn the lights on) is BUMPED from the list IMMEDIATELY!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Being pragmatic, I LOVE the hatchback! Also, the dual power down and up windows (why can't any other manufacturers in this price range get this one!?), made in Japan quality (nearly three years and not one problem), NO daytime running lights, and the roof system to name a few.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the very first car that I have bought on my own. I love all the features for the price that I paid. It was incredibly easy to finance, since Scion provides finance programs for those who are first time buyers and the interest rate isn't outrageous. This is a great car with plenty of room for four passengers. I love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like how this car is iPod ready, has a glass roof (does not open like a sunroof, but the front and back ceiling opens), the reclining back seat, and how the enitre back seat folds down.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just exchanged Sienna van for this coupe. It is really fun to drive, I test drove it three times before I bought it. The coupe is perfect for what I need with its great handling and speed. It also has great build quality. I don't need to upgrade much because most of the things I need come standard. I love the sunroof, it looks cool. This car also has a nice stereo. I cannot complain about the price. It comes with 17 inch alloy wheels! It's awesome. Thanks again for the Toyota build quality.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The double sunroof, keyless entry, alloy wheel with 17' tires, and the most important feature is how roomy it is compared to the Honda Civic Coupe. Its head lights are gorgeous.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I first saw this car in 2005 when they first came out. I have researched it for over two years and bought it FINALLY last night! This car handles like nothing else I have ever driven! The steering is nice and tight and it has no skips in acceleration when you hit the gas. I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a sporty ride with out the huge price tag that comes along with so many other cars in this class. Even though I'm a new owner, the car has far exceeded any and all expectations I had, from the way it handles to the cars' interior layout and ease of use with the controls! I am having a love affair and my husband is sooooo jealous!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I bought the black cherry pearl tC. I love the color! But my favorite is all the standard equipment. The moonroof and sound system are the most important.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car as a replacement for my 2000 Focus ZX3, seeking something sportier, but not completely impractical. The tC came to the fore after some difficulty trying to nail down the local Honda dealer on a price (and availability) on a Civic Si. Both were in the running, but after a bit of time at the Scion/Toyota dealer, the quality of the tC and the great buying experience at the Scion dealership made it a no-brainer. Toyota quality/reliability (and the accompanying resale value) is gravy. This car is a tremendous value if you can restrain yourself at the options checklist, with power windows, locks, remote entry, great audio and God's own sunroof as standard make it a tough car to overlook.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The nicely controlled and taut handling without the accompanying punishing ride. This car has strong acceleration and decent fuel economy. I like its clean and tasteful, if fairly derivative styling. It has great fit/finish and materials throughout. I had a spectacular buying experience at Scion dealer. Minimal insurance premium impact.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am 22 years old and straight out of college looking for a reliable way of getting around town. It came down to the Mazda3, Civic Si, or the Scion tC. The overriding factor came down to the overall package that the car gave me. The Mazda3 was asking for over $23,000 (OTD) with all the features I wanted and I couldn't stretch my bank account that far even though I know it was a solid car. The Civic Si has superior handling, performance, and interior design over the Scion tC but like the Mazda, was asking for a tad more than I wanted to pay ($22,000 OTD). I compromised with the tC paying just under $20,000 because of the value package being my overriding factor in purchasing the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm 18 years old and this is my first real car. I had a 1990 Nissan Maxima for a while. This car is everything I wanted and more. It looks nice inside and out, has enough power to have fun, everything is high quality, and it's fully loaded bone stock all for under $18,000. This car is best car you can get under $20,000, no other company will have two moonroofs, 17 inch rims, keyless entry, and a MP3 headunit come stock. The car has nice pickup especially 2nd gear and its ride is sooooo smooth. It's like you're gliding. I recommend this car for anyone.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love how it's fully loaded, the looks inside and out, how everything is together for the driver especially how the shifter is right there for easy shifting, the panaramic roof (although it makes the car heavy) with the two roofs, the supercharger option without voiding warranty, and all the aftermarket stuff available!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did not intend to buy this car. I stopped at a Toyota dealer after test driving a Subaru Outback and a Mazda3 and I liked them both. Well, the smoking black 2007 tC was just sitting there waiting for me. My son was chanting in my ear to test drive it (I think as a dare). It is a simply beautiful car with plenty of room for what I needed at a rock bottom price for a fully loaded sporty car. I bought it and now I just have to try to keep my 20 year old away from it.

I can haul four people and have the AC on at full blast and and it still accelerates like a dream. And the room is amazing! I am 6'4" and I fit without a problem. For the money, this is the best car to buy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got this car at the weekend and love it so far. I got the TYC taillights, because I hate the standard ones (boring). The TYC's look excellent with my Nautical Blue. The TRD short-throw shifter is also excellent, a huge improvement over the stock shifter. The point of my review though, is that the 2007 engine is actually slightly tuned up, and the real figures for hp and torque are: 161hp @ 5,700 rpm (300 rpm lower than before). 163 lb ft torque @ 4,000 rpm (200 rpm lower than before). Those are the official numbers on the Scion site. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It has nice accelleration in 2nd gear especially. The TYC taillights are a huge improvement over the stock ones, especially with dark paint colors. I appreciate the slight engine power improvement this year. Everyone loves the reclining rear seats. It has lots of space for four average size people to sit comfortably without knees touching the seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought an '07 Scion tC this past weekend and even though I've had my eye on one for a while, actually owning this car is much more of a joy than I could possibly have imagined. I had a '99 (new) Jetta for about 7 years and had lost the excitement of owning/driving my car quite some time ago. The tC's fit and finish are top notch and this car has WAY more power than I expected. Its interior layout is intuitive and all of the buttons have a solid, tactile feel. You really can't beat Japanese automobile craftmanship these days, especially Toyota. I thought about the new Civic Si but its design seems pedestrian compared to the tC. Scion really nailed the youth market branding. I highly recommend this car. Period.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is just what we needed. I had a Miata and my wife had an Xterra. We needed something to take the place of both. She needed room for her cleaning business and I needed something that felt sporty yet a little safer than the Miata. This car has a dual sunroof, folding back seat, and comes with all the bells and whistles (like cruise and leather wheel, etc) What a fantastic driving experience, it is very nimble. Also, we have had the car 6 months now and do not have one complaint. CR stated that the car has plenty of space for a sporty car. The rear seat is actuallly sedan-like. All in all, could not be happier with it. It gets looks too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Sunroof rattled badly from day 1, as did wind deflector. Very irritating with no fix offered at dealers. Service bulletin recommendation may/may not work. Dash is stretched too thin and can see undergrid - appears wavy. Got worse after about 3 months. No dealer support for problem, yet seriously reduces value of vehicle. Ride is a little stiff and road noise is almost intolerable. A little higher profile tire on a 1" smaller diameter wheel might have done it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wish I'd gotten a manual, overall pretty happy with it because of all the extra power windows/locks/sunroof stuff. There seem to be some complaints echoed here that I've been experiencing. When the tire psi is set to the manual specifications, the tire gauge light turns on; the only way to turn it off is by inflating the tires over manual specifications and I don't want to wear out my tires. Don't over fill your coin holder; a coin dropped into the lid reservoir and now the lid won't open the whole way. Went on a road trip with boyfriend and we were both comfortable. Wish radio were a bit more ipod/mp3 player compatible. As a woman, I like the panic button on the key. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove this car recently while waiting for my 04 Cavalier to get serviced yet again. I fell in love with this car from the moment I saw it and was stunned at how fun it was to drive. Tight handling, good acceleration, and really cool dash features. Needless to say I traded in my Chevy and am so glad I did. There is simply no comparison in my opinion when driving a Toyota and a GM made car. The difference in quality was apparent as soon as I opened the door. Just a solidly built car with quality parts thru out. If you want a reliable car that's fun to drive, buy this car today!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Moonroof is really Nice, acceleration and cornering are superb (very difficult to drive this car under the speed limit as it begs to be pushed), interior smartly constructed. Great looking car in and out. Slide the seats up and or fold them down and it's amazing the room that opens up in the back!</FAVORITE>

The funny thing is that it came with Bridgestone tires and I have replaced them with Kelly tires and have had NO problems with the new tires what-so-ever. That can get a little pricey.

<TEXT>Has one of the best designs out there with a nice sport coupe. Quality is overall nice and good value for the money. Engine seems outdated and suited more for trucks with high torque maximized at 4,000 rpm and overall poor mpg for this type of car. Engine seems to run at high RPM for cruising speeds, could use a 6th gear and a more refined clutch.Weight is relatively low but there are some blind spots which may get in the way. Its very fun to drive but performance is a bit low for a 2.4L engine compared to other cars such as the Audi and VW which get over 200hp and torque with 2L engines while receiving same or better mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a middle aged woman who fell in love w/the tC after an extensive amount of research. For the price, you can't beat it. 36,000 highway miles on mine. I just totaled it--dry roads, moderate speed. Impossible to correct and crumpled like a plastic cup. Hatchback shattered after impact. I was unhurt, but very surprised at how poorly it handled under a diverse situation that could have been corrected easily in my old Nissan. I came out w/compression fx but it could have been worse, especially if it had rolled. Next car will not be a tC. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a poorly made car but reliable as all can be. After the first month my radio door started squeaking. The first day that it was below 25 degrees you could hear what sounds to be a bolt snapping against the windshield...3 warranty claims later and still does it. The drivers mirror vibrated like you wouldn't believe so that was replaced under warranty. The trunk rattles so much it will make you go mad. The gears are too small, with a different 5th gear this car would easily get 40+mpg. At 70mph in fifth I'm at 3700rpm. I wouldn't recommend this car to anyone with my experience without corrections to these areas.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, Scion tC is worth every single dollar. What I love the most about this car is its exterior design, very sporty and handles good. I have spent less than $2000 in performance upgrades, and this car is a champion, compared to others in its class. the only downfall i could find on the tC is its cheap paint job, the paint chips really easily. Also the 2.4 engine that only performs 160 HP stock. The Civic Si performs 197 HP with its 2.0 liter engine, I would have expected more than 16 0HP for a 2.4 liter engine.

<TEXT>This is a nice little car for the price. It's got pretty good handling and a very sweet engine. The cornering isn't as flat as I'd like, but the steering is pretty sharp, especially after I got rid of the original tires. As is, it's pretty tossable, but I'm probably going to get an aftermarket rear sway bar to help flatten things out. I love the flexibility, if not the total horsepower, of the engine. It's smooth, torquey and quiet. Exactly what I've come to expect from Toyota. The transmission has good ratios, but could be smoother. 6 speeds would be nice. I really like the styling both outside and inside. It looks like it costs much more than it actually does.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am proud to admit out loud that my Classic Silver Mica tC already has 85,000 miles on it. I know it seems crazy but it's too much of a fun car to drive. What makes it even more encouraging to drive it is the extra money to buy aftermarket parts. I'm averaging 29 mpg (combined) with the Cold Air Intake even with my heavy lead-foot. My downs about it aren?t serious defaults to not turn anyone away from test driving it and buying one. But it's expensive to do dealer warranty maintenance like 30k or 60k; my dealer cost me $485.00 each time. My other down is I wish Toyota spent little more production money on better paint job.

<TEXT>Have had the car for roughly 7500 miles and so far- so good. Only minor issues such as a small rattle in the rear hatch- apparently there was a TSB (I believe a Toyota service bulletin) to fix it. The car is the special edition- so it comes with a Kenstyle body kit- upgraded interior, and a better sound system than the stock version. Real glad I chose to do that. Not sure if it is just mine but my car seems to have a whistle when on the highway anything over 60 mph which I'm not to crazy about. Guess I'll just turn up the speakers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was extremely pleased the first 12 months. However, for the past 4 months, a a sharp clicking rattle-like noise started to occur and became increasingly persistent as time went by. It took literally 8 visits to the dealer before the problem - faulty sunroof construction - was detected by me from researching tC noise rattles on the web. Upon hearing that there was a Toyota Service Bulletin (TSB) on the earlier models at a tC Owners Blog, I showed the article to the dealer. He then advised that there was a second TSB that I qualified for, and after I left the car with the dealer for 2.5 days, I got a completely new sunroof - all new glass and rails. Now, I'm in "heaven" again.</TEXT>

No doubt I will be getting a turbocharger to give it the extra punch it needs but it'Ts a great daily commuter and weekend fun to drive toy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car caught my eye at a Toyota dealership and I have loved it ever since. I find that this car has as much pep as my previous car, a Honda Accord V-6. I am middle aged and could afford a more expensive car, but why when this car offers everything you need at a great price! I am also tall and find that I have plenty of leg and head room in the car. I have taken the car on 2 long road trips and it handled the highway great and they were very comfortable rides. This car with the sunroof and sleek look, makes me feel young again!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car for the money. This car is actually heavier (at nearly 4,000 lbs.) than my Saab 900. It handles and performs well for its weight/power distribution. Cargo space is wonderful but you wouldn't want this car if you are a 6 footer. First gear is very high and the clutch does not engage smoothly in low gears. (first and second). Mileage is good but not great in this day and age. I consistently get 30 mpg. The material which covers the dash board was warped on the passenger side from new. Scion refuses to honor this as a warranty issue. No biggie. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Flat folding rear seats and iPod capability. State of the art styling. Glass roof. Wheels and tires. Resale value. Ability to upgrade with dealer supplied options. For now, it seems like it's going to last a long time. </FAVORITE>

I live in florida where it rains a lot and I feel pretty safe when I drive it. It is a peppy little car when needed. There is a lot of room for rear passengers and I love the sleek looking silver accents . Great car for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had no problems with this car at all. I bought it 2 months ago and already have 4000 miles on it and the only thing that has gone wrong is a clutch cable had to be adjusted because I tried power shifting it a couple of times. It is a great buy for the price. It doesn't jerk out of any gear, you just need to learn how to drive a manual. The clutch is a little touchy but once you get used to it, it's awesome. You can put the power to the wheels in an instant. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my first "brand new" vehicle after many years of battling the constant problems of the unreliability of my other used vehicles. I am ultimately happy with my purchase have no regrets. I love how tight the car drives and how versatile it is since all seat can fold completely flat. It also has ample leg room in the back for passengers and the reclining rear seats are also a plus! Gas mileage is decent considering it's a 2.4L, and one touch windows and a stylish sunroof also are an added plus. It has all the bells and whistles you can ask for within this price point and it is pretty sporty looking sitting on 17" wheels and can go pretty good with 161HP. All not bad for under $17k.</TEXT>

When you see a Scion, you think it would be a fun driving experience, after a year, I have came to conclusion that it is not much of a driving experience and the styling seems to be a bit bland.

<TEXT>I bought my Scion after 2 test drives and I liked everything about it, the look, features, performance, price etc. However I was disappointed when I began hearing squeaking near the radio and rattling all over the place. After just 7 months I had a problem with a fuse. When I turned on my headlights all of my interior lights would turn off, my car was pitch black at night. Another big disappointment was the weak AC. It blows mildly cool air on the coldest setting. This car has heavy doors and paint that chips/scratches easily. I have to say that aside from all the imperfections the car is pretty decent on gas mileage and the sunroof is a good feature. I guess you get what you pay for.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my favorite purchase ever! I was looking for something smaller and a little sportier and I couldn't be happier. It has just enough cargo room and I'm surprised at what I've been able to fit in the trunk when I put the back seats down. The doors are nice and long which makes it easy for people to get into the back seat. I have to say that I'm really happy with the amount of interior storage spaces and cup holders, my friends and I use my car to go everywhere and we're always comfortable and we have a lot of fun. The only thing I miss about my previous car is the automatic headlights. When I first bought this car, I kept forgetting to turn the headlights on and off.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm 2,500 miles into my 2007 Scion tC and I can say I'm pretty happy with my purchase. Most reviews tell you how great the car is, and for the most part, they are true. It's a pleasure to drive and looks great. Not to be negative, I just want to take my chance to inform readers of the flip side. Don't get me wrong, I love 95% of the car, but to offer more insight to prospective buyers, here are the things that irk me: the sunroof cover is cheap. It is made of flimsy canvas and mine broke and came off the track the 2nd/3rd time I used it! Black interior shows every little speck, nearly impossible to keep looking clean. A/C vents aren't placed well, it's hard to get air to blow right on you.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The iPod add-on! Tire pressure warning light is a plus. Hatchback w/ lowering back seats comes in handy. Little storage cut-outs under the back floor. Stereo lid/cover (I have had no problems w/ it). Huge glovebox. Interior lights look nice at night. Ability to customize is a plus.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The handling is exceptional in corners, and the feel of the road you get in the wheel is exciting. The inner design of the vehicle when you look out immerses you in its whole driving experience. Though I'm usually distracted with all the buttons and plentiful doo-dads, sometimes I do realize that I am driving, and possibly should stop playing around with it. The car is so much fun to drive, what I described to you is a day-to-day occurance. I don't think I could have picked a more tailored-fit car to my needs and get more than I expected for a very fair price. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Front retracting moonroof, rear still-moon roof. Driver seat adjustments for pitch and thigh support (which really helps you relax your legs while shifting) makes it a much more enjoyable drive. Also the auto up and down window buttons make it so easy to drive and shift after opening or closing them.</FAVORITE>

Got the Bazooka sub from the dealer, and it produces an OK amount of bump, but you can certainly get a lot more for the money with an aftermarket one. The only thing I really miss is automatic headlights. It's been a month and 1000 miles later, and I'm really pleased with my purchase! I highly recommend this car for anyone not wanting to spend a lot of cash for a lot of bang!</TEXT>

<TEXT>In true light of the topic, this car drives very well. Out of the wrapper this is hands down the best bang for the buck. I own a 5spd tC for 1 year and18k miles, and I find the acceleration is adequate, handling is nimble, top end is good. Brakes are adequate though I occasionally wish there was NO fade. Fuel economy ranges from 22-30+ depending on how ?spirited? you drive. I notice a slight difference with the 92 octane gas (here in NY) but at $3.30+ a gal save the money and go regular (89 octane). The seats accommodate you well, though on long (4hr+) trips I can appreciate more comfort. I often travel alone, but with one passenger, two if you include my 100 lb. German Shepherd. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Glass roof, good stereo fun to drive, price. The tC pulls 0.81g on the skidpad, halts from 70?-0 in just 179 ft and moves you 0 to 60 mph in 7.4 seconds! You?re going to have to spend $5000 more to top all these numbers. With the tC's modest price it lends itself to tuner enhancements.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the '07 right when they first started hitting dealerships. Fun to drive, I4 is peppy, gas mileage is not so great. Highway driving is noisy and high RPM once you get over 60. The Z rated tires that come with the car are unnecessary and wear out instantly. Despite its weight and FWD, car handles snow & rain poorly. The double din radio is great for aftermarket head units. Huge sunroof is cool, but rattles like nobody's business. Doors rattle, rear hatch rattles. Buy the accessories online, far cheaper. 2-in-1 floor mats are nice. Seats scuff easily, not very comfortable. Car is a pain to clean because of body shape. Blind splots a plenty. No telescoping steering wheel. Long and heavy doors.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I loved the car ever since I saw the concept back in 2003. The styling was what caught my eye. I had wanted one ever since they came out, me and my babe went to test drive them and I knew I had to get one, so funny cause we test drove the tC cause of me, and my baby beat me to it and bought it before me, I bought mine a month later. This car surpassed by far all my expectations, everything about the car is great, the styling, the standard features, the comfort, the quality of the ride and the crafting and materials, and the economy, all around the tC is a winner!!! if you want to have a good sporty experience go for the 5 spd manual.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is great for the price. If you're buying it to throw a bunch of money into mods however, I would suggest you move up to the Civic Si. The tC has two fundamental flaws that enthusiasts will have to spend a lot of money to overcome. One is the lack of an LSD, and the other is the glass roof. The glass roof makes the car heavy at a place you want a car to be as light as possible. If you're looking for an affordable, good looking, reliable, daily driver with a hint of sportiness, this is the car for you.</TEXT>

Extremely reliable and even my father who owns 2003 BMW, was amazed with overall performance and handling. Even at speed of 125 mph, car doesn't have any vibration. 4 cyl camry engine beats 07 Civic ex at drag strip. A good car on the snow also. The car doesn't want to spin 360 easily even though E-brake was engaged. This car should've priced around $22,000. I like the way its steering wheel gets heavy on high speed cornering. Good 4th gear acceleration on high speed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the tC to commute to work in. I thought it would make the otherwise boring drive fun and something to look forward to. I was right. My favorite features are the sunroof, including its shade, the manual trans and the stereo. The car handles well and gets a lot of attention. My commute is 50 miles each way and I always get at least 30 mpg. It is a mix of country roads, boulevard stop and go, and freeway. On the highway I get 32-36, depending on my level of enthusiasm. I've had no problems after 14K miles and wouldn't change anything about this car. This is my 3rd Toyota. I suppose because it is under priced, it is compared to lesser cars. Fair enough. It's good no matter what.</TEXT>

Yeah right, this car saw the shop more in its three months life than my Acura Integra did in its 11 year lifetime! Rattle this, rattle that, clutch disengaging when cold, bad engineering on the glass wind deflector/sunroof. It's like sitting under an exquisite chandelier during an earthquake. It's beautiful to look at, but deadly when things goes wrong. The coolest thing about this is, Toyota isn't really doing anything to fix it. I have an '07 tC and still had a hail of shattered glass fall into the cabin. Other than that, it's a decent car with OK gas mileage</TEXT>

You can't expect the car to handle corners like a BMW, but it is good. It's a spunky car. First and second gear are very quick. The aftermarket parts by TRD are reasonably priced and are locked in at that price for three years from the day you buy the car. I can't complain much about it for a vehicle that only cost $17,000.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the best car out there for the money. I shopped many cars when buying this one and took a good three months before deciding after test drives and reading reviews. This car beats the Corolla, Civic, and Sentra hands down for the money. You can get many more standard features in it than in a Honda Civic EX. With this car you save at least $5,000-$7,000 with the same features. I drive it 100% in the city and it gets just 19-22 mpg as advertised. You can get up to 33-35 mpg at 70 mph on the freeways. Overall I am a very satisfied Toyota customer. Don't go by the negative reviews out there, some people don't understand cars at all. Period.</TEXT>

<TEXT> I love everything about this car. I have no regrets at all about purchasing it. I have made a couple up grades to it and I love it even more. You can't get a better car for the price and that no haggle price on the car does not mean a no haggle extended warranty. I got a 7 year extended warranty, the wheel and tire warranty, and the anti-theft for practically nothing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power.. I've added a header, cat back exhaust, and a air intake. The torque and the horsepower are just outstanding.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car as a good, safe small car for my teenagers to drive. However, they may have trouble getting Dad out of it. My normal daily drive is a 1988 Porsche 924S that I love nearly as much as my wife, but this new Scion is a lot of fun to drive. With its sleek body style, the double sunroof, 17 inch wheels and general good looks, I don't mind parking the my old Porsche from time to time and driving the kids' car. Of course, the kids are not too pleased.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love everything about this car. I have no regrets at all. In my opinion, it's the best looking car out there for under $20,000 with good gas mileage. I love how it drives fast plus, I can U-turn anywhere!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first time with Scion. I love the car more every day. I can't wait for it to warm up so that I can open up the sunroof.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the excellent instrument / dash control configuration. It is so simple.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well, I waited for three month before I wrote this review. I wanted to buy either a Civic, Corolla S, Mazda3, or a Scion tC. The Civic and Corolla give you good gas mileage but the they are no fun. Both Mazda3 and Scion tC are very fun to drive. I drove both of them with manual transmissions. The Scion tC is better for couple of reason. First it's a Toyota, which equals reliability. The Mazda is a European car, and at the end parts are more expensive. Second, the Scion just looks so much better. Just tint the windows. Overall I would highly recommend the Scion tC.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The acceleration, exterior (especially the sunroof), iPod aux input, sound system, and trunk.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this car for a month now and all I can say is I love it. The iPod hookup is a great feature and I love how mean the fog lamps make it look. The handling is simply amazing, and it's pretty quick for the money though I am planning on throwing a turbo in it. I'm not too impressed with the gas mileage, but that could just be because I was driving a '98 Corolla with a 1.8 liter before this.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling, interior styling, and the iPod hookup. The 2.4L VVTi engine isn't bad either.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have put about 5,000 miles on this car so far and I love it. For just being right out of school, it came at the right price, just under $20,000 after warranties and extras. I think there are little things that they could do to improve the car, but its a good start for a fairly new model. I'm 6'2" and I fit in the front just fine and I can fit in the back but, there's not as much room back there. The clutch is kind of weird, but after using it for a bit it's not too bad. It has great pick up for just a stock car. The motor in it is the Camry motor, so you know that there is a good proven engine under the hood. I get about 27-31 MPG, but I think that they could make that better with a 6-speed transmission.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The steering wheel controls, great look to the body, glass roof, how it is pretty good in snow, and the low price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had this car for four months. The car is a looker and thats where it ends. It doesn't perform much better than the average car, doesn't handle well, doesn't get good gas mileage, its paint is too thin, and its build quality and materials are not good. If you're looking for performance or practicality, look elsewhere. If you want a lot of features/toys, fairly cheap, reliable, and a nice looking commuter car, this is for you. The tC can be made to be fast but that would cost too much. My last car was an '02 Civic. I was happier with that. As an unhappy buyer said, if your last vehicle was an SUV or van, this may feel like a sports car but it's far from it. No matter how they market this car, it's just an average car</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>With only two doors, the hatch helps with a little storage. There are a lot of toys (even though they may not be necessary). The glass roof is nice, but some may not like it. The factory seats are pretty good. No matter how the interior of the car rattles, the engine and transmission will last! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After trading in my 2005 Scion xA, I took my new 2007 tC out for a test drive on Bartlett Dam Rd. outside Phoenix, AZ. It handled the twisting, hilly roads with no problems. The cornering was almost flawless, due to sand on the road, but it handled wonderfully. The tC accelerates quickly and definitely shows it has power to spare. Fair warning, It's easy to spin the tires when power shifting into 2nd gear.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The split moonroof is a very unique feature that I really like. The reclining backseats are a nice touch. If you remove the headrest on the front seat, push the front seat all the way forward, lay the back flush with the backseat, you have a nice bed for your passenger to sleep on long trips.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my Scion for a little over a year! I love this car. I was in love with it from the first time I saw a tC! Especially the tC With all the upgrades! It has great power for the import class. This is my first 5-speed and it is so smooth and easy to learn. It handles great and the 5-speed is a BLAST to drive The interior is HUGE for a car this small. It has plenty of room for four adults. With all the standard options plus all the add ons the car is still affordable and is backed by Toyota's reliability. It doesn't get any better than that! If I had to buy another car iI would most definitely buy this car all over again! I fall in love with it every time i drive it! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The in car iPod hook up, fold flat seats, the 17 inch upgraded wheels look awesome, the all glass roof with double sunroofs, the exterior of the car is smooth and easy to wash, the smooth ride, TRD muffler, and engine make a great combination like you're in your own video game. You just can't help but love to this car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My tC is apparently one of many that I have heard have a squeak in the dash right off the showroom floor. It comes and goes depending on road conditions but for a new car is very annoying and concerns me about the build quality comparing this, my first Toyota, to other cars I have owned. The gas mileage is also a little disappointing given that the car is a small 4-cyl. coupe. The car is wonderfully fun to drive and very comfortable over distances. I have a 100 mile a day commute and other than the squeaking love this car. The dealer would probably fix it no problem but they only do this type of work M-F and I do not live near the town I bought it in and would have to take off the day. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The built in iPod radio. Panoramic roof. Very upscale feel and feature list for a relatively inexpensive car. I also like the ultra smooth drive train.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Reading most of these reviews here, I can't help wondering WHAT everyone else was driving before they bought a tC. If they think this car is fun to drive, and HANDLES well - they must have been driving an SUV or a minivan previously. Yes, it handles well compared to a vehicle like this with a horrible center of gravity - but the point is, it's a sport coupe - it has too much body roll and the suspension makes it feel like you're driving a large sedan. I feel like I might as well be driving a Camry (possibly one of the most boring cars on the road). I guess it depends heavily on previous experiences - but this car does not handle WELL at all - and feels dangerously unsure in hard cornering.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The body style, TYC optional taillights, and sunroof. People who travel in the car like the rear reclining seats. It also has nice standard wheels.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle from my experience, is very great car, because the handling of it is pretty good, it is very nice looking, the seats are very soft, and it gets good gas mileage for a 2.4L. The only thing that I don't like is the brakes are too sqishy. Toyota needs to work on the brakes. Other than that the car is very good.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature about this car is that it's different from other cars. The headlights are cool, the taillights are awesome. and the sunroofs are one of a kind.</FAVORITE>
