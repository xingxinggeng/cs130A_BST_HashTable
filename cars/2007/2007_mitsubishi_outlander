<TEXT>I spend every free moment researching and driving cars, and then recommending them to others. After 24 used cars, the first to make me jump into a new car was Mitsu's 'Outty'. Rock-solid reviews everywhere peaked my interest. The unique fold down tailgate got me to the dealership. The absurd amount of cool features for the same cost as a base CRV or RAV brought it home. Obviously, the exterior looks darn good. Despite other reviews knocking the interior, my wife and I (both designers) love the it, and respect Mitsu for not putty phaux grain on plastic. My Infinity FX35 driving boss had to borrow the Outty one day. 'That car is cool! You have a touch screen. I don't even have that."</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Husband: Flip-down tailgate, vanishing 3rd row seat right-sized for our needs, roomy, taught handling, nav system, 30gb HD, and above all, the altimeter. Wife: taillights, tailgate, interior, the fact that everytime we think we see our car, it turns out to be a Lexus that costs twice as much.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought as a leftover model. Had a 2003 previously. Love the keyless entry & ignition. Key never comes out of my pocket. Getting 24 + for mileage. 3rd row seating useless for us, may never be used. Our 2 dogs like all the room available with the 2nd row seats folded. Liked the spare (2003-2006) up inside rather than under as with the models with the 3rd seat. We like the styling , and it is comfortable to take a trip with. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Keyless entry & start, Small hiding compartments, V-6 has plenty of power </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was a happy owner of the 04 outlander and fell in love with the look of the 07. Got a good deal on a sun and sound package demo... I thought, until I noticed the paint chipping and rust on the bottom of the back doors. Went rounds with mitsu only to find that since this is exterior damage that occurred after the vehicle left the lot, it is considered wear and tear. I figured the person driving the demo was abusive, but have learned this is a common problem with the design. This chipping paint is going to look terrible in a year or so. The finishes on the 07 are of a much lower quality than the 04 I previously owned, which has left me with a negative impression of Mitsubishi. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It would be really difficult for me to say what I don't like about this car. Everything is in place and works very well. Driving is definitely pleasant. Engine is quiet and IMHO very powerful. I would buy Outlander again, however this time with navigation and video built-in. We have quite a lot of snow during winter and this car works perfectly on icy road. No complaints at all. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this car used with 40K on it. Mileage a little higher than I wanted it but the car is in great condition. Dark blue, cream colored seats. Navi is very nice - I like it better than my Acura. Built in Sirius and music server - have already loaded 10 CD's. The car has great response and handles very well. Suspension is still because of that - you feel the bumps! Love the keyless entry feature. Very pleased with the car overall - just a lot of fun to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this vehicle for slightly more than 2 yrs now. Had some minor issues when I first got it. The initial acceleration was a bit delayed but was fixed with a re-programming, about a 6-months wait. The side-view mirrors were rattling a bit and a cap beneath it was loose and fixed. The only thing not fixed is a delay when shifting from Reverse to Drive. There's always a couple of secs delay and will cause a lurch if the shifting is too fast. I've verified that this is not a problem on other vehicles. Other than these 3 minor stuff, it is a fun car to drive. Very responsive to acceleration after car is in motion.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I must inform potential buyers that this vehicle has major squeaks and rattles. Mine is getting so bad that I'm considering selling. I can't even enjoy the stereo since the whole interior is rattling and making all kinds of crazy back ground noises when I turn up the volume. Also have multiple rattles when going over the slightest cracks in road. Very disappointed with my 07 Outlander.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, I still like this vehicle better than competing vehicles. However, I do have a few issues. First, the tires are horrible in snow and there are few choices available for XLS type rims. Second, already have several squeaks and rattles. Third, exterior paint scratches easily and body panels dent easily.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just retired in March 07, 2007 and the wife and I wanted a vehicle for trips to Nova Scotia from our home in Ontario. We looked into several other SUVs but we both liked the Outlander right away. It has a lot things that appeal to us. Comfortable seats, ability to switch to manual control (we both drive manuals, mine 2001 Jetta TDI and her a 2004 Saturn Ion Quad Coupe) 4 wheel disc ABS with EBD, active skid control, great sound system etc. Just wish they had made third seat an option and left more room for storage for all us boomers whose children are in their 20s and 30s.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my XLS about a month and a half now, and I love it. It's fun to drive and runs very nicely. Compared to others in the same car segment, this one is the clear winner as far as I'm concerned. Toyota and Honda don't offer as much at this price level, and to boot, I think the Outlander is a good-looking car, especially with the 18" wheels and LED tail lights which are normally found in higher-priced vehicles. Mitsubishi's attempt to include a 3rd-row seat is the only big minus I find with this car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the FAST key feature, the awesome 650W sound system w/subwoofer and the comfortable leather seats. The shifting paddles are pretty neat, too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 2007 Outlander providers the right balance between price and performance. Just had our first "road trip" GTA East out to Niagara Falls. Handled well, great travelling through the traffic on the 400 series highways and the fuel economy wasn't bad. I think I'll enjoy driving this SUV for a long time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of nice features like 6 speed auto, 4x4 shift on the fly, trip computer, high end sound, heated front seats... and the most practical feature for a young family, the liftgate that keeps all the stuff in the back!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove and researched most of the new small and mid-sized SUVs available: Honda CR-V, Toyota Rav-4, Mazda CX-7, Acura RDX, Suzuki Grand Vitara, and the just released Land Rover LR2. I was really pumped about the LR2, but came away disappointed, with an SUV like drive, cramped second row seats, and small trunk. The CX-7 was the most fun to drive, but the Outlander is not far behind. It has a nicely revving engine and the manual shifting is very smooth. The Outlander simply was the best fit in terms of driving comfort and response, utility, and value. I passed on the nav but got the sun/sound and luxury. I have only driven 300 miles or so, but am very pleased so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had our Outlander about three months now and love it. My husband comes home with a smile on his face after driving around in his Outlander all day. We looked at the RAV4 - too expensive with the V6, the CR-V - didn't have enough power, and the Jeep Compass - just not what we were looking for.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had wanted to replace my 2001 F150 Supercrew with a new Mustang, but that was not practical with one offspring still in collage. The Outlander seemed to be the best bet for our needs. So far this vehicle has surpassed all of my expectations! I have hauled quite a few boxes (my mother is in the process of moving) and have torn up the roads using the F1 style paddle shifters. They took a bit of getting familiar with, since I am used to manual gearboxes such as in my wife's mustang GT, but once I did, there is no way that I will use the full on auto, unless the wife is with me. (She likes good gas mileage). Also, the Rockford/Fosgate kicks!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Since buying the newly redesigned Outlander LS we have been extremely pleased with its styling, driveability, and quality. Many of the features that are present in this "small SUV" give the impression of a vehicle that cost more than it actually did. Its good stability on the highway and an excellent braking system lend themselves to a feeling of a secure, stable platform and ride. We really enjoy this vehicle. And one final thing, the low profile drop down rear gate really helps when you are trying to load things into the back cargo area.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We test drove most CUVs and once in the Outlander XLS, there was no turning back. Our second choice was the RAV4, but it didn't have the nice features and the swing tailgate/tire would be annoying when launching our boat. The Outlander will be great with the lift gate and tail gate. The Navigation system is impressive and in winters, the Active Skid Control and 4WD are a must for ND winters. The warranty is top notch.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did lots of research before buying my Outlander. In a nutshell, I found that for about $10,000-$15,000 more you could get a luxury SUV with SLIGHTLY better performance, SLIGHTLY better handling, a SLIGHTLY better interior (if you like the fake wood look), and similar technology and safety features. I figured I'd keep the 50% premium and get a great small SUV with beautiful styling (like a Lexus RX 300 with a boxier rear), great tech features (NAV, Bluetooth, phenomenal stereo w/Music Server!), a clean, simple dash and interior, all the handling/power/safety features I required, and the space and features I wanted (3rd row, lots of storage). The '07 Outlander is a fantastic vehicle, I highly recommend it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 3rd row, while small, is great for when my kids have friends over after school or practice. The Rockford Fosgate stereo is awesome, and the performance and handling is great. When I'm alone in my car I can crank it up, floor it (and use the paddle shifters), and feel like a kid again!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just leased an Outlander XLS five days ago, and so far I'm very impressed! I got it with the Luxury Package and the Sun-and-Sound Package. The ride is excellent and so are its cornering and handling in general. The V6 engine is smooth and provides plenty of power. The exterior and interior have great fit and finish, and interior materials look nice and of good quality. It has plenty of storage space and it's full of great features. It is very roomy and comfortable. It has great bucket seats! The 3rd-row seats are tiny, but I have no need for them, so it's not an issue. Overall, there's not much competition out there for the quality and price. I think it's the leader in its class.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Rockford-Fosgate 650-watt stereo! WOW, it has incredible sound with the factory- installed subwoofer! The Sirius satellite radio is super, especially since it's free for the first 6 months. The FAST key feature is a nice touch and so are the Xenon headlights.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We compared cross-over SUVs and the Outlander was clearly the best value. Our first requirement was front wheel drive or 90/10 AWD (which eliminated the Nissan Xterra and others). Our second requirement was no premium fuel (which eliminated the new Mazdas, the Nissan Murrano, and most turbos). Our third requirement was 6-cylinders, which eliminated the Honda CR-V. That only left the Outlander, Toyota RAV4 and Hundai Sante Fe as options. The RAV4 was too small and the spare tire on the hatch is annoying. The interior of the Sante Fe was cheap/ugly. The Outlander outclassed the competition, especially with the 100,000 mile/10 year warranty. I am still very happy after a month of driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The keyless entry, AWD (90/10, 50/50 or FWD), traction/stability control, NAV/music server, six speed transmission, good gas mileage, handling/ride, side-airbags, auto climate control, miles per gallon display, styling, and lower insurance costs (due to all the safety features).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted a small crossover SUV. My requirements were: engine on the stronger side, full safety equipment, including side airbags and Electronic Stability Control (ESC). Research this online, this is of utmost importance and will be mandatory starting in 2012. The RAV4 engine is a bit stronger but cost more and you get fewer features. I didn't like anything about the CR-V, not to mention the looks and the small engine. The Mazda CX-7 costs more and looks too much like a minivan. If it was only looks I'd take the Xterra, but it has the finesse of a truck (it's not a crossover). Jeep and the other American small SUVs that I looked at didn't have ESC. The Outlander has more than any other vehicle I looked at.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It has all the safety features that I'm looking for, even an aluminum roof to reduce rollover risk. It has a very comfortable ride. It has a strong yet quite engine, good performance, and a superb interior: material, design, looks, space, compartments. I couldn't find any other SUV that gives you nearly as much for the price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Let me start off by saying I wanted the Nissan Murano or the Mazda CX-7, but my husband wanted me to look at the Outlander just to see what it offered. I was so impressed with the standard features and price on the Outlander that we walked away with a fully loaded one at just over $30,000. This is something that CAN NOT be done with the Murano or CX-7. There are so many features on this vehicle that I am still trying to figure them out. You must go see it for yourself to fully appreciate it. The 3rd row seats are small but I knew this when I bought it. My kids (ages 10 and 12) don't mind sitting back there on short trips. I keep the seat folded down for space but it's nice to have it when needed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My '07 Outlander LS has less than 1,000 miles, but it has already delighted me with its good gas mileage. I recently got 28.6 mpg on a 150 mile trip and for a while was actually averaging over 29. The vehicle is spunky when it needs to be. Its controls are well placed and easily accessible. The dash is easy to read. The 6-speed tranny is great, and gives you freedom to shift easily into a higher or lower gear. For example, down shifting for engine braking. This is a comfortable car for even a 6 footer like me and how can you beat the 10 year/100K mi. warranty? Weak spots in design? Maybe it's a bit difficult to see behind yourself, but no more so than in most SUVs. This is a very good buy for the buck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My '07 Outlander has excessive wind-noise...the worst I have seen in any vehicle. The wind noise just gushes inside the cabin. I just keep wondering how Mitsubishi spoiled an otherwise great vehicle with nice value and features, because they did not take care of small things like proper cabin insulation.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 2003 Infiniti FX45 for an Outlander. I needed a more practical vehicle. The good: I paid $25,000 for a demo model with leather, a sweet stereo, and navigation. It drives like a car, handles OK for an SUV, I love the paddle shifters, the 3rd row comes in handy for kids and short trips, and the fold down tailgate is a great idea. The Bad: It has pronounced wind noise from the driver's side window, it has initial acceleration hesitation, the fog lights cannot be used with hid's, and the doors have to be slammed to shut. These are all minor issues. This is a good vehicle overall.</TEXT>

My wife loves the sunroof, and I love the sound system (subwoofer is my favorite part!). Our daughter sits high enough to finally see out of the window and I have peace of mind with the Anti-skid control and enough airbags for any situation. The gas mileage is great for an SUV, but obviously not as good as our Nissan Altima. The XLS model is worth the extra money! We love this SUV! It has the best warranty available and the customer service is extremely pleasant.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle's "ups" are the paddle shifters which make for fun spirited runs, aggressive styling cues both in and out, and a fairly decent engine. The "downs" are I personally do not like the choice of interior fabric. It is said to be better for stains, but in fact it attracts more lint and holds in stains/marks worse and takes much more effort to clean and to keep it that way. The 3rd row seat is useless and horribly uncomfortable. Other than the these things, I love that you can fold the rear seats for better room (though I wish they kept the power folding rear seats that's on the Japanese OEM model). Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase though it's a shame my local dealer is really rude and continues to be.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Outlander for three days. I'm an auto fanatic and very particular. I wanted a crossover for good gas mileage and handling. Nothing else out there gives you the features in terms of safety, comfort, technology, and styling that you will find in the Outlander. Don't get the "It's a Toyota, or Honda" name sell you. The material quality is not a 10, but seriously feel its competitors and it's on par, but with a MUCH better execution. It's quite and comfortable. It's like driving a lifted car. It provides sporty performance with great gas mileage. The warranty is another factor to consider. I traded in a Jeep Liberty and couldn't be happier. Don't be scared about first year model, its been out in Japan for a couple of years.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The heated leather seats, Bluetooth, the 650W Rockford system (it's clear and bumps despite reviews), paddle shifters on the column not the steering wheel, info display (gives you all you would want to know), LED taillights (rare in this price segment), very versatile rear seats (2nd and 3rd rows), and fast key.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I currently own a 2004 Outlander, so I'm familiar with the quality of the brand. My wife traded her 2005 Subaru Outback for the 2007 XLS 4WD. We absolutely love this car. The ride is great and the vehicle is fun. I tried to talk her out of the navigation system, but we got it and it is awesome. The wheels, stereo, and of course the engine are all quite an improvement over the 2004 model. We compared it to the CR-V, Saturn, Toyota and Subaru (Outback and Tribeca) and nothing comes close to matching the engineering marvel of this vehicle. Note: there is no new car leather smell to this vehicle. The odor absorbing headliner keeps the car smelling, well, clean. Which is nice, since we have dogs. Give this car a look</TEXT>

It has lots of room, the back seats recline and move forward, and back and best of all is it has a left hand cup holder for the driver right by steering wheel! The doors are hard to close and the u-joints are not very good, but other than that, this is an awesome vehicle. It is so cool. The third row seating is perfect for a young family!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I hadn't planned on looking at the Outlander as I'd never heard of it. I'm glad that I found out about it! Compared it with CR-V, RAV4, Santa Fe, etc...which are all fine vehicles, the Outlander hit all the right points on what I was looking for. What I especially like is that it gives me almost all the things I would want in a larger SUV in a smaller and more fuel-efficient size.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This vehicle has a super price-to-feature ratio. It provides the functionality of an SUV/truck, yet rides like a car. I love its sleek styling. It comes with a super warranty (5/60k), but beware you need to hit maintenance milestones or risk voiding it. It has plenty of well-thought out storage areas. The built-in tie-downs in the rear cargo area are great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am not a person that takes much risk or buys anything impulsively. But when I decided to buy the Outlander 2007, that's how friends and family thought of me. But so far, I have been happy with my new ride! We were almost going for the RAV4 , after evaluating CX-7, CR-V, Tribeca, when the Outlander came out. The Outlander is by far the best value for money for this segment. Its fun owning a car with a super cool navigation system, music system, Bluetooth combined with a V6 and not so useful but yet handy 3rd row seat. I am just waiting for the NHTSA crash test results, and if it gets a 5 star rating, then I am totally satisfied with what I got. Despite all the negative history on Mitsubishi, this vehicle rocks!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the HDD based Nav system, 650W Rockford Fosgate stereo, xenon HID, Bluetooth connectivity, music server, FAST key system, heated front seats, tailgate, and V6 engine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just got my Outlander LS 4WD a week ago, and I think I just might be in love. I've always owned GMs, but I needed an SUV for the headroom (6'4"). Most SUVs have terribly boring styling, but this thing is beautiful! It just looks like nothing else on the road. I traded in an '04 Grand Prix, and I love the fact that I can fit in a vehicle, without it feeling like a massive SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Outlander handles like a car - a good handling car at that. It's quiet, there is nothing is flimsy in the interior. The vehicle fully equipped is an amazing value with many features the competition doesn't even offer. The transmission is very adept at shifting and selecting gears. Its gas mileage is right about what you would expect for a mid-sized sedan. With electronic brakeforce, all wheel drive, and a six speed trans, this vehicle is sure-footed to say the least. The sound system is fantastic. I could go on and on but it scores very highly across the board. There is a knock that we hear in the suspension and some wind noise around the mirror, but we're still happy and will get that fixed. This truck has no real flaws and has had no failures.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The handling, great steering feedback, AWD, navigation, nice sound system, interior comfort, quality of the leather, styling, storage space, and how it gets nearly 20 mpg with only street driving, no highway and using 87 octane while getting well over 200 HP!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought my Outlander last month and I'm very satisfied with it. I test drove the RAV4 before buying the Outlander, and my wife and I felt dizzy after. It was not a smooth ride unlike the Outlander. I got all the options and the navigation is very helpful and accurate. The sound system is great. The hard drive in the sound system is wonderful as I store all my music in it. The vehicle handles itself well, even at high speeds on the freeway. Its cargo room is impressive. The fast key feature is wonderful and very helpful. Add to that the 5-year standard warranty and the 10-year powertrain warranty, and there's no other deal that can beat that at it's price (for under $30,000)!</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I started shopping for a new car this fall, I never in a million years thought I would buy a Mitsubishi SUV. BUT... I did and I love it. Mitsubishi has raised the bar! This vehicle blows away anything else under $30,000. I wanted an Acura RDX, but couldn't swing the price. This truck gives me most of the features, almost the same performance and size at $10,000 less. I first read about about the new Outlander in InsideLine. I waited for a dealer to get one and then drove it. I loved it! I loved the features, the looks, the interior, everything! For a die-hard Honda/Acura guy like myself, the fact that I bought one, should tell you just how good it is.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I LOVE the Bluetooth thing. How did I ever live without this? The stereo is awesome (I got the Rockford Fosgate Upgrade). I love the swing-down tailgate, it's very cool and great for loading (you won't scratch your bumper). I also love the FAST Key...two weeks and I haven't taken the key out of my pocket yet!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased the Outlander XLS 2WD today! I have to say, after searching for the past six months and doing some homework, this is the car to get. I test drove the CR-V, CX7, and Santa Fe, plus the old Trailblazer (previously owned). There is no comparison, this is the best and a definite MUST buy!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride is just plain fun. The acceleration is fantastic, it makes sharp turns and the handling is superb. You get the perfect split between a sports car and an SUV, which is what Mitsubishi was hoping for. They've definitely outdone themselves with this one. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We test drove the Toyota RAV4 v6, Nissan Murano, and the Outlander XLS. After reading a lot of positive reviews of the RAV4 we test test drove it and it was a bit of a let down. The engine was great however everything else was not. The interior design is very old ladyish. My wife and I agreed on this. Also, the great gas mileage that the RAV4 sports is offset by the required premium fuel which translates into a 2.5 miles per gallon reduction from 29 to about 26-27 mpg when price adjusted for premium fuel when compared to outlanders regular unleaded needs. The Nissan Murano was nice, but way too expensive and interior felt too ritzy and not sporty enough. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We did not want the navigation system at first, but is an absolute must now and for the future. The voice prompted guide is perfect and spot on. It recalculates a new route after a wrong turn in seconds. The nav also allows for an uncluttered look the the dash because everything integrates through the nav except for the ac/heat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far, I love this chariot! It's a nice ride. I purchased an Outlander XLS 4WD with navigation, the Sun & Sound package, and the Luxury package. THE GOOD: Engine power is adequate, (not afraid to pull out in traffic.) Fuel Economy is OK. (I'm seeing about 22-23 MPG in mixed driving.) Sound System w/ NAV is VERY NICE! Leather, heated seats, Bluetooth, sunroof, paddle shifters - nice and roomy, excellent warranty - all for just under $30,000 MSRP. (That's a bargain in my book - even more so considering I paid well under MSRP). THE BAD: Yes, it does have some wind noise around the A- pillars at highway speed. (But I just turn the stereo up!) In FWD mode there is a good amount of torque-steer when footing it (this is fine in 4WD Auto Mode).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The LCD Display, navigation system, stereo, Bluetooth, Sirius radio (with 6 months FREE), hard drive based system which copies your CDs to it. (You only have to put in the music CD once - then play the copied version from the HD from that point forward!) leather, roominess, warranty, and ride height. </FAVORITE>

The engine gives a good response, the handling is superb, and the tech toys are abundant. this truck is way more than I would imagine for the price. The overall package for the price cannot be beaten by any competitor. The Outlander has all the qualities I could want for an SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine power is great. The 6 speed Sportronic transmission gives a smooth ride without excess revs. The handling is great, it drives like a car.

<TEXT>I have only had the car for a short time, but I haggled about what to buy for three weeks, test driving all kinds of cars. The only one I could compare this drive to would be the Subaru Tribeca, which was like $5,000 more expensive and took premium gas. I don't think you could get a vehicle filled with more features that drives as well as this for the same money. Don't be scared off by the estimated gas mileage either, I have been averaging around 22 MPG, which is not that bad.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 650W Rockford Fosgate system is amazing! Add that to the Navigation system, Sirius satellite radio and the 30 GB hard drive with 2,500 song downloading capabilities and it's unreal!

<TEXT>I just bought an Outlander ES and was surprised by the performance along with the list of standard features. Originally I was set on the new Honda CR-V, but felt it was too weak. My second choice was the Toyota RAV4, but I felt that the V6 engine was way too expensive. The Outlander is the perfect middle ground. I'm used to driving sporty cars and was surprised by how much better it handles than vans / SUVs I've driven in the past. The only negative I can think of right now is the fact the second row seats don't fold all the way flat down.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Mitsubishi hit the nail on the head with this one. I test drove the competition: the CX-7, RAV4, CR-V, Murano, Santa Fe and Tribeca. Nothing came close for features, quality, and price. The Murano and Tribeca had slightly more front legroom, but aside from the small details, I couldn't justify the price. The CX-7 was OK (no BT feature), but couldn't justify the premium fuel requirement. Honda and Toyota weren't willing to deal at all (nasty attitude). Hyundai had no features and poor gas mileage. Our Outlander came loaded with HID's, LED tails, Navigation, Bluetooth, heated leather seats, and a 5yr/60k bumper to bumper, 10yr/100k powertrain warranty. FYI, you can get beige or black leather depending on color.</TEXT>

It also had the V6 engine and 4 wheel drive. The CR-V we looked at had a shorter warranty, no 4 wheel drive, less horsepower and a 4-cylinder engine, with a higher price tag.

<TEXT>I had a 2005 Toyota RAV4. I bought it for its "reliability, but I had so many problems with it! So when I saw that Mitsubishi had a new Outlander coming out I test drove it and got rid of the Toyota. The quality amazed me. I didn't expect it from Mitsubishi. I read all the time about Mitsubishi doing things wrong. I think they're seriously underrated. I'm very satisfied. I love the fast key. The Outlander is big, but it's cool and the paddle shifters are NICE! The 3rd row is more for kids than adults. The a/c is amazing! In the previous review something was said about torque steer, I haven't really encountered it at all. I could go on about this. Mitsubishi has REALLY stepped up on this one. You can't beat the price and warranty!</TEXT>

It comes with lots of features such as keyless ignition and Bluetooth that are not even available in other makes at this price. It is switchable between FWD, AWD and 4WD. Who else offers this at this price? It has fantastic build quality. It's made in Japan with 100% Japanese parts content. After owning Toyota, Mazda, and Nissan products, I've got to say I'm impressed with the '07 Outlander. Mitsubishi really did well with the design of this product. I can see why this outsells the RAV4 in Japan. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very impressed with everything about this vehicle. I test drove the vehicle the day it came out (Friday Nov 3rd, 2006), and it blew my mind. I test drove the Honda CR-V, the Jeep Compass, Toyota RAV4, and the Outlander blew them out of the water. Its turning radius, acceleration, and handling are absolutely amazing. The one thing I was a little skeptical about the 27/20 gas mileage until I drove it to work and averaged 23 MPG! Are you kidding me? A 220HP V6 SUV averaging 23 MPG that's not a hybrid? All I can say is WOW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This new Outlander is light years ahead of the outgoing one. It even rates above the new Rav4 and C-RV, in most respects. It is a better value, more stuff, and great quality. And here comes the "but!" This thing has the worse case of torque steer that I have experienced since I owned a 200 hp front wheel drive Fiat! Stomp on the gas and you better be holding onto that steering wheel, with both hands. And she wanders on the freeway, it feels like it's up on tip-toes...wandering! And bring your Dramamine, because the rocking movements caused by diving when braking and accelerating will cause sea-sickness! Nice effort Mitsu...but you missed out on the important stuff...like being able to drive it smoothly!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle after 6 months of researching several similar small SUVs, like the Rav 4, Hyundai Tucson, Subaru Forester, etc. I found the ride of the Mitsubishi very comfortable, the look very sporty and sleek and the overall driving experience to be superior to the others and the BEST part of this research process was the price piece - the "Bishi" (as my 3 year old calls her) was less than the whole bunch. I have owned the car for two full months and have consistently gotten 20-21 mpg city driving and 26-27 mpg on the highway.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The digital displays that let you know gas consumption, outside temp and miles left per tank of gas. I also love the look of the car (I have a black one). I don't see many on the road and it is a head-turner, especially when it is all clean. The gas mileage is great, too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've been driving the Outlander for a year now. Bought it brand new. My favorites are the torque (very quick), fun to drive, turning radius, love the liftgate (perfect for changing babies diapers), backseats lay down easily, the upgraded bluetooth is nice, all the cupholders are handy, great setup in the front seat, and the long warranty are just some of my positives. My husband likes the head space, yet it is small for tight garage. My only complaint is the seats are very sporty & not as soft and comfy as I would like. After about 6 mo, I had a problem with the circuit breaker (I may have blew something out) and the dealership replaced everything free & immediately with no questions asked</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car needing something with low miles, good gas mileage, but with more room (I am a horse person so I needed cargo space for my equipment). I looked at all the usual crossovers (Escape, Rav4, CRV, etc) and found they were either too expensive, or did not get good enough gas mileage. I found the Outlander, test drove 2, and fell in love with it. I have never owned an automatic, so it took some getting used to, but I am happy with the pickup and passing ability on the highway. Gas mileage is great- I've consistently been getting 27 mpg going 80 all the time on highway. This car is a great value for the money- great options, safe, reliable, great gas mileage, and not boring!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I LOVE the fold-down tailgate, it's really helpful when loading/unloading furniture and other big/heavy gear.

<TEXT>After an extensive test drive and looking at the available competition, I thought that this was overrated. I saw the great reviews by everyone and thought that it was going to be a home run. Since the Outlander is based off of the Lancer, it definitely drives more like a sports car. The ride is very firm and you have a tenancy to feel every bump in the road. The interior left a lot to be desired compared to the Santa Fe and CR-V. The plastic door panels looked cheap and the arm rest was made of hard to clean cloth. The car itself is basically a clone of the RAV 4 in how it looks and drives. If you like that car, you'll love the Outlander. </TEXT>

I've shown it to three of my friends so far, and all three are headed to the dealer tomorrow to get one. I simply cannot say enough about this beautiful piece of engineering. So much for such a great price!! I have to keep going out to the parking lot just to make sure it's still there and I have to pinch myself when I remember it belongs to me. You will NOT be disappointed in this gorgeous, powerful, fun SUV. Get one today. It will honestly be the best purchase of your life. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great pickup on the gas pedal, very smooth and well engineered transmission, excellent sight lines, and better styling than an HHR or PT Cruiser. Combine that with the 10 year 100,000 mile powertrain warranty and you have one awesome little package for very little money. </FAVORITE>

I found after test driving the Outlander test drove more like a smooth sports car. I fell in love with the diamond black exterior paint and the spacey interior. Overall a great vehicle to drive, per performance wise. After one winter the paint chips near the rear panel on both sides of the vehicle.

I have driven vehicles for half a year before first chip, this car had significant paint erosion after a couple of weeks city winter driving pavement.

The Outlander met almost all my expectations. Appearance & design: nicely designed interior and sporty exterior. Performance and good gas mileage: 220 hp + 6spd auto tranny. Price: $25k w/options. Drivability: ride quality (suspension, road noise, handling), interior comfort, visibility, and interior space. The Outlander also offers a lot of neat std. and optional equipment (see Fav. Features). I highly recommend you consider the Outlander when researching/test driving similar vehicles, you?ll probably buy it</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sun & Sound pkg = sunroof, stereo upgrade (it's awesome), & flat screen monitor w/DVD, Aud./vid. port (ipod/video games). Split liftgate door. 6spd tranny. Steering wheel stereo controls. Sirius Sat. radio. Pwr outlets. Long warranty. Bluetooth. Even has odor eliminating ceiling liner! </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Found a best buy</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>With over 22,000 miles, it is flawless. I test drove everything from BMW X3 to Rav & nothing in this class will match the Outlander in all categories. I traveled routinely through the worst winter conditions imaginable & this vehicle is an awesome snow machine, even with the wide/street Goodyears. The exterior design is perfect & it stands far above the rest in looks. There are some minor quirks such as the torque steer which is easily fixed by putting in AWD or adjusting your starts. The Goodyears wore fast & need replacing soon. Anyone in winter conditions will experience lower "sandblasting" problems to the paint (apply addit clear protection & no problems or wait till 2008-fixed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first purchase of a new car. I owned several used car and been to leasing for few years. I've been shopping around since Dec 2007. I read many reviews and done a lot of research before test driving the CR-V, RAV4, Element, RDX, and the Outlander. After test drove the outlander, I have a second opinion about Mitsu. It turns out that the Outlander has the best value, best warranty, and best incentives in its class. I pull my trigger on March and have been satisfied after driving 1200 miles. The car looks sporty and has many functions I like. I love my ride. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>GREAT SUV</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Went in to actually buy a kia sportage and test drove the 2007 outlander 4 door 4wd and loved it, best decision I could of made. Reliable, fun to drive, lots of space and the back opens up from the top and the tail gate comes down, great stereo system, the only thing I can say is the gas is not as good as the paper said on the window. It gets about 22-23 miles to the gallon not 25-30 like it says. Comfortable when you have others with you and just a all around great vehicle. I do not see many of these on the road but I bet they catch on this year! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All of it, lots of little things, Gas feature lets you know how far till you run out of gas, it has bluetooth and the stereo buttons are on the steering wheel so your not messing around with the radio while driving,great feature!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Vehicle has all the bells and whistles but does not have any useful features that don't cost much such as 1. Telescopic steering wheel or rather the lack of it. Cannot find a comfortable position even with arms stretched out and seat pulled forward, and I am of average size 5 10 with a small paunch. 2. Zero Cushion in leather seats for better distribution of pressure and back support. 3. Arm rest too low and useless. 4. No sound deadening materials. Noisy is the word. 5. Suspension makes for an extremely uncomfortable ride. Every undulation in the road is sent straight to driver's spine. 6. No door inserts or soft dash. Just a sea of hard thin black plastic.</TEXT>

The car is so fun to drive. I even got this monster up to 125 mph with friend. The average gas mileage for me was about 24 mpg on the highway.

<TEXT>Overall this is a top notch design by Mitsubishi. As a complete package it outshines all other competitors in the segment and for a price far less than expected. Performance, power, style, handling, comfort, convenience, technology, fuel economy and fun all wrapped up in a sharp looking CUV with big room on a small budget. Nice fit/finish for this segment - tight seams and clean lines all around. Interior plastics are on par with other manufacturers, but could be slightly softer. The 6-speed is responsive and great for mileage, but can hunt for the right gear on long inclines. Reliability shouldn't be an issue, especially with the outstanding warranty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my XLS eleven months now and am very happy with it; no problems yet & going strong. It has a number of features usually found in much more expensive cars, but if Mitsubishi wants the XLS to compete against the higher-end SUVs in its segment, then they'll have to "up the ante"; they'll have to install illuminated vanity mirrors (and improve quality of sun visors), programmable automatic locks, dual express-down windows, real fog lamps, mudguards, driver and passenger power seats, auto-dimming mirror w/built-in compass and HomeLink. With at least these additional features, it would put the Outlander XLS more at the Acura/BMW/Lexus level as opposed to the Honda/Toyota level.</TEXT>

Fun to drive, handles good, decent fuel economy (20mpg+), and lots of great features. I cross-shopped all CUVs, it came down to the Outlander vs. RAV4 V6.

I purchased a 2007 XLS, with the three upgrade packages (luxury, sun/sound, and nav packages) during Christmas week (got a great end of year deal - payed only $28k!) and I couldn't be happier with this car. The engineering, attention to detail, and high tech appeal is just unbeatable for the price - not to mention the 5 year/60k mile warranty! Beats the competition hands down! Do the research, take a test drive, and you'll probably end up buying this car - I did! </TEXT>

The one draw back, although I like the 30 gb music storage, I still wish I had an outlet for my zune/mp3 player and the system doesn't seem to have cd name and title for some of my most recent cd purchases. Otherwise I cannot complain. I am happy with this purchase. I am not sorry I passed on the toyota and honda so far anyway. I've had it for about 6 months now. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been most impressed with the AWD system on this vehicle. It has an electronically controlled clutch that engages and disengages based on inputs like wheel speed, steering wheel position, throttle level, etc. Unlike other vehicles that rely on a viscous coupling, the front wheels don't need to slip before the rear wheels receive power. This vehicle drives all four wheels from a standing start. The end result is that this vehicle holds the road in winter conditions like no other vehicle I've ever driven. It feels solid - like a Swiss watch - and looks good too. On the down side, it is not as powerful as the RAV4 nor does it get as good of mileage (about 2mpg and 49HP less).</TEXT>

<TEXT>The new body design is amazing as well as the interior. Driving the car is fun, handles very well, has great acceleration but the trans is not always in the right gear, once in manual mode the paddle shifters make it a whole new ride. Even with four fairly hefty passengers it performs well. Love the exhaust note on XLS, resembles my G35 (6gr-manual). The interior has a clean and inovative look to it with clever storage everywhere and crafty 3rd row seats. Soft cloth seats are comfortable and hold you in surprisingly well, and the std sound system is great. The keyless entry makes the car so much sweeter. Overall, nice car, great buy. Mitsubishi has done well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature by far has to be the manual paddle shifters. Another favorite feature is the storage space in the back combined with the keyless entry. The engine power for its efficient nature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>4000 km drive to "break it in" showed that the road noise a little higher than we expected; the auto trans can be a little annoying, and it can scoot along with the best of them. The paddle shifter is a fun toy. In auto mode the damn thing is always trying to save gas with a very annoying rpm drop after every up shift. It drops off 500 rpm after the shift?! This is a truck and when I forget that and go romping into a corner at nine tenths it reminds me in in a controlled certain manner. But when dialed back to normal rate this is a very respectable handler well worth the money. Tried all the competitors and this is the best value. No regrets at all.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Space, visibility, simple layouts, fit and finish, very comfortable seats and of course the 10 year warranty. Better value than competitors by miles. Will not compete with the likes of Audi Q of BMW X but at this price still - wow. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did a good amount of research before deciding on the Outlander. The three crossover SUVs that were in the running was the Honda CRV, Toyota Rav4 and the Mitsubishi Outlander. The Outlander has a smooth ride and is quick! It can pick up speed on the highway fast and before you know it you are hitting 80 or 90 but it?s so smooth you won?t notice it. Cool looking inside and out. Great car for the money.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great looking dashboard and gauges (deep sunk in gauges, well lighted even in the daytime). Has great interior lights for those of you with children.

<TEXT>This car is great for its class and offers more for the money than any of the competition's. It looks good and is very fun to drive. It is an athletic yet comfortable car that has always been great so far. It is faster and more agile than most other small SUVs and has a host of great standard features. I also really like the gauge computer and the 6-speed auto is unheard of in this class. Also, the 4WD system is great and I highly recommend it for buyers who encounter snow and slick road conditions like I do.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It has great, balanced and well-weighted steering that most other cars are lacking. I also love the firm cloth seats and the back seats that move back and forth for legroom or cargo room. I also like the interior design and the advanced powertrain is smooth and powerful.</FAVORITE>

The interior geometry & functionality is superb, you'll have no problems finding extra space to store stuff. Despite its high stance, it rides and drives like a car w/very good handling and a comparably comfortable ride. Put it on 4WD lock & you'll be surprised how well it handles twisty roads at moderately high speeds. Power-wise, you may not take off like a rocket but there's a lot of it to pass and climb steep terrain. Overall, this is a great car. It certainly deserves more credit than what most other reviews give it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I want so much to like this vehicle. Drives well under 140 kmph and gets very floaty and a little twitchy over that. AWD is not up to quality and useability of either Subaru or Audi - not by a long way. But it's o.k. Road noise is higher than I would have expected and clangy doors are a disapointing sound. The auto transmission is my biggest disappointment. 6 speeds and paddle shifters are cool but the constant downshifting and that annoying 400 rpm drop after every downshift makes long trips less than as enjoyable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned 10 months, driven 11,000 miles, & this is my take. Solid, responsive, fun to drive, overall great vehicle for the price. Have done a couple of 1000 mile road trips & found it to be very comfortable & a great performer. Am astounded with morning commute fuel economy being consistently over 30 mpg. Freeway average is 23-24 mpg, which is okay but expected more given commute mpg is so high. Pet peeves - the all round low quality interior, hard to see orange display in sunlight, & wind noise on drivers side. Observations - can be awkward getting cup in/out of holder with arm rest pulled forward, & swaying in high wind on freeway. If improvements below were made, would definitely buy again!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After being sick of struggling around in a rear wheel drive sports car in the snow I decided it was time to purchase a winter car and something with some room to transport items. I debated just about every small SUV and drove quite a few. I wasnt even looking at the Outlander until a good friend (Mitsu owner) told me I should give it a try. The dealer let me borrow it for the afternoon and that is all it took. The car drives great, rides as well as a family member's Lexus RX 300. The MMCS (Mitsubishi Multi Communications System) is awesome and has just about every feature available. I rarely drive the sports car now as this is a better ride and still great fun to drive!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MMCS, Rockford Fosgate stereo is amazing. You can watch DVDs when in park on the MMCS. Trust me, it's great if you are camping or waiting on someone at an apointment! Took it on a 5 hour trip and didn't feel uncomfortable at all. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The V6 engine is strong, but hard acceleration off the line results in heavy torque steer coupled with tires (Yokohama) that do not provide enough traction for the amount of power this vehicle delivers. Ride is silky smooth, but a bit loud by today's standards. Steering column controls are good as well as climate controls, but radio controls are too small. As deeply inset as the speedometer and odometer are, they still have glare when sunny. Seating is comfortable, but cloth is thin and feels cheap.

<TEXT>I'm very happy with my purchase, and for the price paid it stands alone. I'm a tall person (6'5) and I have plenty of room to spare. It's a very smooth and comfortable ride. I took it on a 3 hour road trip over labor day weekend and it's pleasure to drive, especially with the upgraded stereo system. :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased a new 2007 Mitsu Outlander XLS AWD and so far I am very happy with the decision. This car has a number of great features and is very stylish inside and out. Drove a Honda CR-V and some others but this seemed like the best way to go. Standard V6 blows away the competition and I also like the drive selector switch that lets you control 2WD, on demand AWD and full time AWD. I've been getting great gas mileage on mixed driving (I've even averaged over 27 mpg on my regular commute just the other day). Have felt some swaying with heavier winds which did surprise me. This SUV feels like a mid sized SUV in terms of interior space and with the V6 but gets the gas mileage of a compact.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>FAST key system, AWD selector knob, bluetooth, gate, 3rd row, steering wheel mounted controls, LED tailights, auto climate control, storage space, sliding armrest, shift paddles, wheels, odor eating headliner, leather wrapped steering wheel, warranty, info displays and overall design! Great car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car had nearly everything I wanted in a small to midsize SUV. I use it as my daily driver. I got the Diamond White Pearl XLS FWD model with all the bells and whistles except the DVD package. I got the navigation package with 40G hard drive, sunroof, leather, bluetooth, SIRIUS radio (I'd have prefered XM), etc. The gas mileage is okay, around 21.6 average. Mitsubishi owners are also a great bunch of people, this is my second Mitsubishi; I own an Eclipse too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>What's not to love. This car is really a fun driver, the leather is higher quality, the 40G hard drive is fantastic for recording my music CDs, I am never out of music.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great value compared to competitors in its class (Rav4, CR-V, Santa Fe). It offers more standard and at better pricing than its competitors. It's got more power standard compared to its competitors, and is roomy enough to fit 4 large adults. Exterior styling is excellent and doesn't look the part of a "cute ute". I would recommend anyone looking into purchasing a mid to small SUV to look in to this vehicle if they want the most for their money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've received nothing but compliments about exterior and interior. It's perfect for me and my daughter. Would rather it had a little more power but it's more than sufficient. Handling is great, and gas mileage around town is just about 20, not bad for an suv. Have not used the flip up seats, but have comfortably sat 5. Rear seat belts are difficult to latch for an adult (narrow positioning). So far I love this vehicle. Mine was loaded with everything but a rear dvd player, all the toys are well worth it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The touch-screen nav is awesome. First time with navigation. Stereo is great, especially with ability to store cds, although I find myself listening to satellite radio all the time. Also the fast key is pretty cool, another first. The onboard computer lets you set a lot of personal options.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After doing much research on the CR-V, RAV4, and other small SUVs, I finally chose the 07 Outlander and after a few thousand miles of driving I feel I definitely made the right choice. Love the sporty exterior and interior styling as well as features such as the Rockford system (best system in the class by far) and the great fold down tailgate design that I have used a lot. Also you get the best leather in the class plus all the tech gadgets that make me happy. Sporty handling, well weighted steering, and a joy to drive. Decent fuel economy compared with RAV4 and CR-V, but the benefits definitely outweigh! Test drive it and you will be surprised!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty styling, 30 GB navi and music server, Rockford Fosgate stereo w/ aux jack, Bluetooth handsfree, heated leather seats, smooth 6 speed tranny, relatively peppy engine, fold down tailgate, lots of storage everywhere. I avg 22 MPG with light foot. Luxury features and feel for entry price! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this car for about 3 months now and I love it! Definitely not a mom SUV. I'm a 29 yr old male who has previously owned a Mazda RX-8 and Audi TT. Great transition vehicle for me. All the upgrades are worth it, wouldn't have gotten it without them. This car is very fun to drive too. I've never noticed any road or wind noise. The 3rd row seat is small, but my wife rode back there once, she is 5'7, and said it wasn't bad. Just couldn't do for a long road trip. Front seats are very comfortable, back seats a little more stiff. Fuel economy is great IMO, a lot better than my previous Mazda. All around, a very cool ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rockford Fosgate 650 watt system, touch screen system that does a lot besides navigate, AWD, iPod jack on the back of center console, LED lights, storage compartments, Bluetooth, nice leather, rear tailgate is cool, cool looking orange lighted gauges (not hard to see), good on gas, extra outlets.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We were looking for a green car with if possible style and performance. Test drove the CRV, Pilot, Highlander and a hybrid Escape. None came close to the Outlander in style and performance. In CA the engine is rated PZEM and is the cleanest non-hybrid SUV out there, I think. The big surprise was that we can fit both our road bikes in the back upright! None of the others could do this. And the mini tailgate is very convenient. A solid, nice handling, luxurious little/big SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned Toyota and Honda for the last 30 years and have no complaints. I test drove and researched the Honda CR-V, and Toyota RAV4 thoroughly before reaching the conclusion the Outlander far exceeds these two in quality, ride comfort, and value. The Outlander has great style, a 6 speed transmission that is smooth and perfectly balanced. It is quiet inside and has a fantastic Rockford Fosgate stereo and bluetooth.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my very first car! Since I got it in January, I've been very, very, very happy with it. Every aspect is just right. I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I just started working, but just needed a car to move my kid to school and places. Our Britax convertible car seat fits perfectly, and when I tell my friends this new Outlander has the latest-tech rigid anti-crash frame (called R.I.S.E.) as well as six advanced-tech airbags, plus 5-star frontal crash test result from the NHTSA, they are impressed. Great value!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very well built; comfortable front and rear seats; third-row seat (reason why I bought the XLS trim), good for young kids; Mitsu's high reputation for safety engineering and great crash test ratings for previous generation of Outlander models; handles really well in everyday driving; great braking.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ok, I'll make this short because I could go on forever. About a year ago I ordered a brand new 2007 BMW X3, it came with all the options I wanted, and boy did it go fast in a straight line. It didn't do much else, and I returned it and its $50k pricetag this March (after putting 5k miles on it). Yes I took a loss, and yes you can laugh, but the bottom line is that I realized you can spend a ton less and still get great cars. The point of telling you that is that I absolutely love my new Outlander that is $20k less than the BMW. This time, I researched/testdrove/etc. every other small SUV out there and the Outlander beat them all.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ext/int (yes not as "refined" as bmw, but the leather is great and I actually want a more hardy interior w/some plastic), 4WD, navigation, didn't think sound system was going to be worth it but it's awesome, tailgate, sliding 2nd row, changeable options (wiper spd, light fade), handling, PRICE!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have been driving my 2007 Outlander ES for a while now. Styling is exactly what I'd always liked and build quality seems solid so far. Interior appointments are excellent even on my base model. A real pleasant surprise is all Outlanders come with car alarm standard (good for saving on insurance). Long warranty is generous and transferable to 2nd owner. Performance is the best part and what makes this SUV stands out from other compact to midsized SUVs. It's got enough zoom and zip to make driving fun. Great compact SUV!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The best looks on the outside. Inside is roomy and comfortable. I have the luxury package, sun & sound, and the accessory navigation package that I can't live w/out. Hard drive based nav is fast and the music server that expels the iPod is cool. It has a powerful v6 engine that outruns those four cylinders. but still very fun to drive. It has the best features in its class. Some standard features are additional costs to the competition. The split open tailgate liftgate is very clever idea that adds the best convenience in cargo handling, unlike those that open sideways with bulky doors with tires on it which blocks your way. The best bang for the buck, best SUV on the track.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Despite its power, towing capacity, and sure-footed 4WD, this vehicle drives like a car. The ride feels solid, the features are great. I love the FastKey system, the stereo, and the abundance of cup holders. Seat warmer warms seat AND back. Paddle shifters for those who want more control. MP3 player jack too. The Outlander is really fun to drive, and the partial-zero emissions and great mileage make me feel environmentally responsible. I'm very happy with this purchase. You can get a 4WD, V6, superior stereo, sunroof, 3rd row seat (ok it's wimpy), leather, GPS navigation built-in with 30GB hard drive (10GB of which can store MP3s) for well under 30k.

The third road seat is not that useable and I would like to have that as an option to get the extra storage. The clamshell rear opening is very versatile.

<TEXT>My Outlander marks the end of a long search to replace my 1995 Aurora. It stomps the Toyota Rav4 and Honda CR-V on looks, warranty and practicality; it is more driveable and gets better mileage than the Dodge Dakota; and it has more usable storage than the Dodge Magnum with much better visibility. Performance is not what I enjoyed with the Aurora's V-8, but the Outlander has acceptable zip (on regular gas) and gets better mileage - almost 22 mpg on my daily in-town/Interstate commute. The 650-watt stereo and 10-inch subwoofer are fun to show off, but if you aren't into rap then I would suggest you stick with the standard system and use the extra $$ to take this on a vacation. </TEXT>
