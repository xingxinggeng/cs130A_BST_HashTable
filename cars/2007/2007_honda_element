<TEXT>We just bought our Element after many hours reviewing the vehicle. So far it has been a lot of fun for our family to drive. We wish the gas mileage was better but we are looking into that. It is just a great car and everyone loves it. We did have to put two baby sun shades side by side over the skylight, works great.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So, like everyone else... my car is my toaster. I love my toaster but I would like to say it rides very rough. It's also much noisier than my hubby's truck. but, it's spacey and really fun to drive. My friends love the back seat b/c they can see what's going on with the theater style seating plus it is really roomy in the back seat. easy to haul stuff too with the size and versatility. I love it, just wish it was less bumpy of a ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sc look. It makes this car look very sporty. I love the wheels. And the center console.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is one incredible vehicle. Perfect for my needs and one monster beast in the snow and ice. Great interior room, looks great from outside and I can easily haul just about anything. Love the fact no carpet to contend with, sweep and wipe and it's clean. Outstanding reliability. I have over 35,000 miles and have had no issues whatsoever. But then it is a Honda, I expected nothing less. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>in love w/ a element</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I fell in love with the Element when the very first one came out, with the exception of the panel on the vehicle. In '07 when I saw the SC I fell in love all over again. This car may look like a toaster, but from the inside out it is an exceptional vehicle. I love the room it provides on the inside to how there's no panel on the outside. I've had my SC since Nov. '06 and still have it today with over 37,000 miles on it and I haven't had to this day any problems with my SC, except taking it in for regular maintenance. I feel it's one of the best investments u'll ever make and u wont regret it one bit. For everyone else who's had problems I think it's the driver not the car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Cons: The Element is my first Honda and probably the last. Reliability and build quality was surprisingly poor with subpar components. Tires wore out at 24,000 miles, all new brakes (rotors & pads) at 30,000, speedometer broke at 5,000 miles, windshield replaced twice with mystery cracking, drivers seat cushioning compressed and wrinkled, and scheduled services are over priced. The ride of the SC model is very harsh if the road is less than perfect - I had to stop drinking coffee in the car due to it too easily splashing. Brakes are noisy even shortly after replacement. Very uncomfortable for long drives due to no "dead pedal". </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The look is cool and the space in the rear is great. Love the ability to easily move the seats around without removing them.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Honda element. This is my second one. Only issue i have is that this is the second time that the master brake cylinder went out after about 29,000 miles. It was under warranty. I also had a 2004 element and the same thing happened. Kinda odd that it would go out in my 2007 element. I think Honda should check into a internal leap problem in the master brake cylinder. Other wise, I love my element. thanks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Okay, when my Dad owned one in Silver I totally thought it looked like a toaster. He raved about it, so when the lease on my 2004 Grand Cherokee was up I thought what the heck (always been a Jeep girl) Test drove the Element and the CR-V and to be honest the CR-V was teeny inside, my husband is 6'5" and he has plenty of room, so do my two boys. I love the ease of a rubber floor with two kids and the special order stain proof fabric on my EX. But most of all Mommy loves cranking up the tunes on the killer stereo system. Super fun to drive & own. Better than any Jeep I have ever had, more fun to drive, better gas mileage and AWD if I ever need it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Honda Element but the blinds spots are annoying when backing up. I have had to replace the brakes on the rear after only 17,000 miles. Honda Corp. has not followed up on my complain either to resolve the issue. I have owned many vehicles and have never had to service calipers or replace brakes with so little miles. Very disappointed in Honda in how they handled the issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was in love with the element from day one, it took me until 2006 to finally take a look inside . I was hooked! In dec. 2006 my dealer found a 2007 kiwi lx manual I ordered and bought it on the spot, no test drive needed. I read different reviews for people wanting carpet, different shifter location etc. For them I say "get a normal car." the Element is not for everyone, but good for children, pets, hauling things and having fun.</TEXT>

<TEXT>OK, I confess: I did convince the dealership to put carpet, floor mats, and the SC wheels on my E. There, I said it. Notwithstanding, I really love this vehicle. With the 18s it corners better than my 2007 Camry SE (manual) did. I am really amazed. True, it is not the most aerodynamic vehicle on the road, but it'll pass. I love the versatility of cargo space usage. I can get a lot of stuff inside, like 6 foot trees, etc. It makes trips to home improvement stores a breeze. I like that it takes up less floor space in my garage too. It's odd that a vehicle with so much interior room is shorter than a Corolla. I enjoy my E.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I first saw this vehicle, I thought it was one of the ugliest vehicles on the road - I nicknamed it the toaster. My son and I went shopping with my husband for a Ridgeline. While my husband was discussing the terms for the Ridgeline, my son and I checked out the Element. Once we sat inside of it, we fell in love with it. We went for a test drive that day - within two weeks I had my Element. I love it, and now I find it quite cute. It's fun to drive, very utilitarian. We've carted everything from a flag pole, gardening tools, plants, baseball equipment, fishing poles to our Springer Spaniel with ease. The car makes everyday rides fun adventures. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought a 2007 Honda element sc model silver, 18 inch mags sc package, right now it has a little under 6000 miles on it and its been in the Honda shop a total of 4 times. First it had a noise underneath the driver side, so they said it was a strut assembly. The replaced under warranty which is good still the noise was there. We take it back the second time for another kind of noise on the driver side doors they adjusted them fixed for a while again back in the shop now said they hooked up some microphones all over it and found out the noise underneath is the steering rack? So in the shop again oh yea this thing gets very poor gas mileage, the power is lackluster and the windows are noisy</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car to replace a truck and a mini-van. It did that and more. Drives like a car, has the utility of a truck, and the comfort has surprised me. I have used it for family vacations, football tailgating, commuting, hauling large items to the dump, taking the dog swimming, and kayak fishing. I plan to go camping in it this spring. It is without a doubt the most useful and fun vehicle to drive and own that I have ever had!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my E for almost 7 months now. Included in my 16000 miles is a 6300 miles across the US trip from GA to AK (yes, Alaska). I towed a 1500# trailer behind it the entire way. I have absolutely no complaints about the comfort of the seats (even after 10-12 hours). The creature comforts and convenience items were well placed, easy to reach, and worked wonderful. The utilitarianism (is that a word?) of the vehicle is fantastic. We have made the decision to buy a second one to replace our other small SUV. IMHO - you won't regret getting one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was drawn to the Element by the interior flexibility and suicide doors and it doesn't look like a mini-van. My previous car, however was a Subaru Forester and I think Honda could take some lessons from Subaru on building AWD drive trains. This car has torque steer on hard acceleration and there is a lot of wheel spin on wet pavement. Once you get the element going, it's a hoot to drive. I am interested, though, to see how this car will perform in snow (a little worried). The ABS works well which will be good for snow driving. I miss not having the headlights turn off when I turn the ignition off, although, the warning bell has kept me out of trouble so far. I could do without sunroof</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was first concerned about the location of the stick shift lever. However, the location is in a suitable place and this is not an issue. The manual transmission aids the driver to control the vehicle and requires little effort to employ. Both the suspension and transmission handles very well. I preferred the manual over the automatic after test driving both vehicles. The Element?s large interior dwarfs my 1997 Grand Cherokee. Very large or older adults can enter and exit the rear seat of the Element with ease. The rear seats can be configured to carry various loads. This is important to both home owners and active individuals that participate in outdoor activities.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite items are the awesome sound system that plays all formats, rubber floor, highly legible gauges, and the mutli-configurable rear seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Element is the ultimate utilitarian vehicle. I love the flexibility of having a large cargo area. The entire interior is easy to clean, I am never worried about getting it muddy, wet, or dirty. There is tremendous flexibility with the cargo area since the seats go up. The AWD works great, I've been through heavy snow with great results. On long drives I fit a twin size air mattress in the back and sleep 2 people. I can fit just about anything in the back (bikes, sofas, tons of gear, etc). It seems like every inch of this car is build purely on logic. It's a no frills car that is brilliant in its simplicity. Hey, it took genius to discover E=mc^2, the element follows in that tradition.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Waterproof interior (I really have taken a hose to the interior). Easy to clean (a vacuum works wonders) Super flexible seating (lie flat for a bed, fold up one or both back seats) Low cost Better than average fuel efficiency Very comfy for all passengers Very flexible, all situation vehicle</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It's exactly what I expected. Only car I have ever owned in which I do not get a backache-amazing support on short or long trips. Split rear door is extremely efficient-infinitely better than most splits & better than all single doors. Very useful for utility, carrying big & lots of things. Great traction in snow. Only 3 negatives which I expected:rear seat is useful only in a pinch; had to remove headrests from rear seats to see, but don't use them anyway;choppy ride. Otherwise turning radius is great,headlights great,lots of stg places,easy to clean. Got armrest stg option, and love it. Would not suggest for young kids with carseats. Great for dogs-leave backs of rear seats down always</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Element for a month now so I feel I can review it. The quality is top notch, this is a well put together car. The interior is simple and roomy. The exterior is streamlined and attractive! (to me anyway). It drives smooth, and accelerates well for a box, you have to push it to higher RPM's to really zoom, but the power is there if you need it. The shifter looks like it's in a weird spot, but it really isn't if you think about it, Honda just opted for a shorter stick and a subwoofer.The sound system is amazing, you can alter your heartbeat with the bass if that's your thing. The doors don't bother me, but I'm not moving kids around. Overall a great dead useful vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Element. It's so roomy and not all cramped and confining. My husband is not a small man and in some small SUVs his head actually touches the roof and there's no leg room. He is very comfortable whether riding or driving. We've taken several vacations in our Element too. Great gas mileage, fun to drive. I love how the back seats lay all the way flat, fold to the side or come completly out to create more cargo space. And when youre riding in the back the seats actually sit higher than the driver so you can see out & over the people in the front. My dog is a taxi for my two Boxers and they love to go for rides.

<TEXT>Thank you Honda for releasing the SC! The SC resolves the two main issues we had about the Element (unpainted surfaces and the rubber floor). Overall, we are very satisfied with our Element SC.

Why drive a boring mini-SUV when you can get the complete package w/ the Element.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I can't say enough how much this is my favorite car I have owned so far, including the '03 Mercedes CLK320 I traded in for this fine SUV. I got the Nighthawk Black Pearl w/ black tinted windows, giving it a very sleek, head-turning appearance. They finally fixed the grey-paneled look that has kept me from fully appreciating the exterior. It rides firm, but sporty while still feeling as tight as a vault. The engine noise is not a concern at all. Acceleration is fine, since I just like to cruise in it. I already used its immense hauling capabilities each of the first 3 days I had it! This car is a keeper! </TEXT>

I'm a fairly tall guy and when it is cold I opt for a hat. This baby has room for me with room to spare. I like the wash down interior. My EX has the higher quality seat covers front and back.

<TEXT>The Element has most beautiful interior (extreme?) . I like especially the heavy-duty flooring , removable back seats and the fabric . Element is very agile little SUV, it has excellent transmission. I really appreciate Honda for placing polymer panels in places where Hondas notoriously rust and get bumped - the fenders , front and back over bumpers and thresholds. Element is very roomy car , it handles very nicely and I love its Boxy Lego-like looks.. My element like to sip the gas though , I wonder why ?. But since it has 75 cubic feet cargo room it is not a tragic situation. All things considered, the Element offers excellent value for the dollar and I am extremely happy . </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been a long time loyal Honda owner since I was 16. (Now 34 and 6 new Hondas later...) Initially I was a bit skeptical about buying this car. After months and months of research, asking questions, test drives I bit the bullet and bought one on 1/8/07. I've had it for almost 4 months and 3800 miles later, I must say this SUV exceeded my initial expectations! I've driven in several bad snow/ice storms and this SUV just keeps goin' while the other cars and trucks are stranded on the side. (The real-time all wheel drive works wonders!) To make a long story short, if you're considering an Element, go out there and drive it, you'll definitely be impressed!!! </TEXT>

I love how "open" the car is with it's big windows. It is a great priced vehicle. I feel like I got a quality product, and can still afford to travel and put food on the table:) Insurance rate did not change too much.

<TEXT>We just bought our 2007 Element a few weeks ago, and we already can't get enough of it. My wife and I wanted something different, and we are now the envy of all of our friends. No one can believe how roomy it is. There is plenty of room for your gadgetry and other 'stuff.' The back seat has plenty of leg room for your guests. Would definitely recommend for anyone that is looking to 'wow' their friends and family! LOVE the in dash XM Satellite Radio - I don't know how we lived w/o it before buying this car. All of this cool stuff - AND Honda quality! Overall grade is A+.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven the Element in snow, off- road and on highways. The vehicle seems to be at home wherever I go. I am getting about 21 miles to the gallon in around town and highway mix driving. The interior is functional and is exactly what I wanted. It allows for quick changes from passenger vehicle to cargo carrier to wet dog carrier. The radio is outstanding and the controls on the steering wheel make driving and changing stations much easier. Overall I would rate this as an outstanding vehicle for someone who is between getting a truck or a van and doesn't need seating for 5+. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I never really use to like the Honda Element. However after test driving one, I am hooked! I ended up buying one from Boch Honda on the Auto Mile. I LOVE how the Element handles and drives. All my friends cannot get over how much room there is on the inside. I love how easy the seats in the back fold up to create even more room. I will definitely purchase another Honda!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything! I love the high ceilings and how roomy it is.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car. It is perfect for my outdoorsy lifestyle and works great with my big dog. I can't wait until this summer to take it on more road trips. And can't wait to be able to camp out in it. I love being able to fit all my gear plus my dog plus a friend and their gear in a car that gets great gas mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the rubber inside. My dog makes big messes in my car when we go hiking or to the dog park. I have no fear of stains and know the clean up will be done with ease.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased my 2007 Element a couple of weeks ago, and I love it! It's great for my two german shepherd dogs! The back seats flip up out of the way easily and the utility floor is easy to clean. It's fun to drive, and handles well. The interior is very spacious, with plenty of leg room for everyone. The steering wheel mounted audio and cruise controls are easy to use. And the XM radio is great! The tailgate configuration in the back makes loading dogs or groceries easy. So far, I'm averaging 24-25 mpg for a combination of city and highway driving. Overall, I love it. It's a great, practical vehicle that's fun to drive! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything! Looks; spacious, versatile interior; rear tailgate; steering wheel mounted audio and cruise controls; XM radio. The tight turning radius makes it easy to handle and maneuver, even in crowded parking lots. Mileage is good for the type of vehicle. And it's just plain fun!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a great little car! I can fit my mountain bikes, snowboards, backpacking equipment and the kitchen sink if I needed to in this awesome car. If you are a person who loves the outdoors, this car will DEFINITELY love you too. If you are a little bit messy - muddy or spill- prone like I am, just hose out the inside and get on with your life. No tent? That's fine. Just recline all the seats and sleep under the moon roof with the doors wide open. I love how the doors swing wide open so that you can put whatever you need to in the back seat without shutting your front door and opening your back door. Oh - and it makes a great changing room on cold snowboarding days, too!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my SC in Galaxy Gray. I love it. It has style, and safety. Great handling. I wish it was a bit FASTER!, but for a 4 Cylinder it has pretty good kick off the line. The lower suspension than the other models is cool. but you feel the bumps more than you would like. Buttons are all easy to understand and perfectly placed. Glove box too small, but you get plenty of nooks and crannies to put your stuff at.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the STADIUM SEATING. My friends used to fight to ride shotgun but now backseat isn't a problem, its a luxury. GREAT sound, comes with subwoofer! COOL rims. I like the Tribal design.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I don't know why these aren't more popular. The look is different but not ugly..it really grows on you. It's a comfortable, roomy and reliable multi- purpose vehicle that sells for about $22K with AWD. People are afraid of the quirky style but they are missing out on a fun and practical vehicle. It really makes you feel young at heart regardless of age. If you are on the fence because of the way it looks, believe me, the Element will win you over. It's really fun, practical and a great value!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a '03 Accord EX V6 for the '07 Element SC. I really bought it for function and convenience (I have 3 dogs), but found there's a lot more I like about it. The SC model was much more stylish and handled a little better because of the bigger rims and tires and lowered base. It's fun to drive. You feel like you're in an SUV but driving a car. I was worried I'd feel the change going from a V6 to a 4 cyl and not like the car as much, but it hasn't bothered me at all... it's pretty good off the start and once you get going, no problem passing others or getting on the freeway. I like it more and more each day. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks on the SC are worth the extra $. No plastic, even on the top. The front end design is much more appealing as well. The handling is what I love the most. The storage capacity is awesome as well. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Versatility allows me to use the vehicle for work during the week, and when the weekend comes, wipe the floor with a rag, drop the seats down, and I am ready for the kids. The ride is acceptable, and the visibility is excellent. I love this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>As weird as it might sound, the composite floor won me over the day I saw it in the showroom. It turns out to be all that I had hoped it would. I have two dogs and my girlfriend has two young kids, so being able to clean it easily really makes my day. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had my first Honda Civic for 14 yrs then replaced it with another Civic several years ago. With two kids, we wanted something safer. Given the heavier weight, side curtain air bags and great crash test results, we bought the Element SC and absolutely love it. Its a lot fun to drive, handles very well, sounds solid when you close the doors, ride is quiet, looks great, safer than the previous Civic and is very functional. It has more room from the passenger seats forward than our Mazda MPV. Another very satisfied Honda customer. When will US car makers get on the ball?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety, XM radio free for 3 months, radio controls on steering wheel, side curtain air bags, fold up/removable seats, leg/head room, plenty of storage, great sound system, 18" alloys, great color (galaxy gray) etc.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After test driving many SUV's I could not believe how this car could have the best road feel, since it's shorter then most of the ones I tested. It was not the quietest or the smoothest ride, but by far the one I loved the most. I liked many cars in my 50 years of driving, but this one I LOVE. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got my Element last week after going in to drive the CR-V. While the CRV is nicer and more refined than previous years, there is just no room for my toys and gear. The Element started to be more attractive from a pure cost of ownership standpoint, as I was looking at leasing a more expensive vehicle originally, but I could purchase the Element for the roughly the same monthly payment. I drove both the SC and standard model, and love the handling of the SC and the unique interior trim points. I'll miss 4WD, but love the wider tires and improved headlight/front end look. I drove it in snow/ice 2 days after purchasing, and although I was a bit tense without 4WD there, it was good.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>-Cool headlights -Awesome wheels! -Great stereo -Integrated XM -Tons of storage -Center console compared to EX model -Sporty handling and peppy off the line for a 4-banger</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We traded in our 2006 Civic because we needed more room for our two kids. I had looked at the element in previous years but didn't care for the looks. Well Honda took care of that with the SC.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the sound system, It hugs the road like a sports car and easily carries anything I need to haul. My first tank of gas it got 25 MPG in mixed driving. I love the split tail gate/ Hatch back.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the most versatile vehicle available in the market segment, We have six of them for our sales people. a 2004,(2)2005,(2)2006 and a 2007 we take the rear seats out and you can fit so much more equipment in them than our two Highlanders,We deliver equipment to construction sites so the all-wheel drive comes in handy as well, I like the new instrument illumiation over the others as well as the vehicle stability control,new seat belt location and side curtian air bags.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted an auto that my husband would hate! When we went in to pick up My new Element. He fell in love with it. I selected the Metallic Root Beer SC. What is so great, it accommodates tall people really well. He's 6' and my son is 6'4" and there is head room to spare. Now this is what is really awesome, the base part of the Honda Element is about the same size as an compact car but the box design allows for more interior room and it fits in my garage easily. It maneuvers very well. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature is being able to flip the seats up and haul large supplies. The toddlers and adults riding in middle love being able to see out the windows. They seem to have as much fun riding as the front seat passengers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought an 03 Element EX when they first came out and loved it; so much so, we upgraded to a Rally Red 05 EX (w/side curtain airbags) in March of 2005. In Sept 06, my wife and two young children (1 & 3 year olds) were involved in a head on collision at 50 mph with an inattentive Ford F150. All three walked away from the accident with only minor bruises and burns (from the airbag). There was no doubt we would buy another. We decided on a silver SC and we ABSOLUTELY love the new styling inside and out. Great car for the kids, dog & all of your stuff. I would highly recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling. New 5 speed automatic makes the car feel more peppy. GREAT sound system. Tons of cargo room. SAFE! and of course, Honda reliability and slow depreciation.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my new Element. It drives and handles so much better than the 2004 Element I traded in. I love the new black utility floor and it is so much easier to get people in the back seats with the seat belts intergrated into the front seats. I'm glad Honda gave the Element VSA and side curtain air bags for safety reasons. I can haul my two Saint Bernards with little problems now. The 166-hp is a nice improvement along with the 5-speed auto. I get about 28 on the highway on average and about 25 in the city. Can't wait to see if it handles even better in the snow than my last Element.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the sunroof that is in the back. I can open that and my Saints can get all the air they need. Also the utiliy floor and waterproof seats are a big plus,they are easy to clean after having two messy, 190 lb. dogs that drool. Basically I just love this car. I wouldn'y give it up.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife was against this "box" as I kept dropping the hints for the past 3 years. MUCH more comfortable for a 6'5, 230 male I told her. Being that the 2003 model was a rough ride (at best) - she was hesitant considering I bought it without test driving. I was not disappointed. Lots of room, fun to drive and SHE LOVES IT. Home run. Literally. :-)</TEXT>

<TEXT>Honda reliability and quality is profoundly evident with the Honda Element. The suspension provides agile handling for such a high-profile vehicle. Acceleration is smooth and responsive at virtually any range. Overall driving experience was excellent with agile car-like handling. Every minute behind the wheel of this Element makes you like it more and more. This Element is much more than transportation; it is a lifestyle companion that adjusts to any need whether transporting the family for weekend activities or carrying large objects for weekend home projects.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior room in this vehicle allows 4 adults to ride in absolute comfort. Rear seat passengers experience limo-style leg room and the stadium seating allows rear seat passengers to look over the head of the front seat passenger instead of the back of their head. Versatile interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Finally recieved it last night after a month wait. Driven about 80 miles so far and it's great. I test drove an 06 LX automatic, but ordered the 07 LX manual because I feel that manuals are more enjoyable, and I liked the added standard features and changes on the 07 model. The element is roomy, and drives well. I like the addition of the standard door lock remote, side curtain airbags, and the fact that the seat belt now retracts into the seat. Have not yet figured out gas mileage, but I know it's better than the Dakota I had. The manual shifter is well placed, easily reachable, and shifts well. I am very pleased so far, and would recommend to friends and family.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very roomy, suicide doors, power (considering it's a 4 cylinder), placement of shifter and user controls, seat configurations, fun to drive, versitle for "any" lifestyle, poly floor makes cleanup easy, interior tie down anchors, plenty of room for pets, bikes, etc. bikes</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>we just brought the new car home and we like it already. the only thing i am worried about is whether my wife is going to like the free XM and when the trial period is over we will be getting a subsrciption. Lots of room, rides pretty nice and handles well. this auto has all safety features on the market with this version and coded keys and theft prevention radio. buy your accessories at manchester honda in CT. they offer close to 25% discount. we ordered deflector, mats, arm rest, and other stuff alot cheaper than from dealer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Initially, I wasn't too sure that the Honda Element was for me, but then I drove it and I became totally impressed. This SUV by Honda is one of the finest vehicles I have ever owned. It is economical and can accomodate any lifestyle with ease. The active adult will definitely appreciate the features of this vehicle. The interior room rivals any limo and the rear seat legroom is phenominal. The ride of the vehicle is very smooth and, yet, is surprisingly agile through the curves. The power of the engine will not throw you back in your seat at take-off, but is more than adequate whether in the city or on the highway. This is one vehicle that is worth the test-drive...you will love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are the multiple configurations of the interior seating. You can literally turn the interior into a comfortable sleeping area. The interior is designed to be cleanable with ease and everything is stain resistant. The build quality of the vehicle is outstanding...it is a Honda</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just purchased our new 2007 Element Saturday, August 26th in Orlando. We had previously owned a 97 and a 2000 CR-V. The 07 Element was too cool to pass up. So far we have really enjoyed the Element, I didn't want a 4 speed auto transmission, so that was the reason for not purchasing an 06. Our earlier CR-Vs had the 4 speed auto and I always thought another gear would have made the performance better on those vehicles. After 150 miles both my wife and I, along with our Lab, love the Element. Now we are waiting to see how the fuel mileage works out.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>New features over the 06s, 5 speed auto trans, the way the door latches on the inside work and the front seat belts in the seats not on the body. Much easier to get people out of the back seats without the front seat people needing to unfasten their belts. The new gauge colors are cool too.</FAVORITE>
