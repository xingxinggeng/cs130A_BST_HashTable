<TEXT>We purchased the 2007 model in 2006. It was between the RAV4 and the CRV. We chose the CRV and the 4WD for the snow. We had a big snow storm the first year and it did as good as my Toyota T100 4x4 truck. We had the rear Diff problem and had it replaced, got free 100k 7 year warrant for our trouble (and the fact that the dealer didn't believe us the diff was grinding). We now have about 45k miles on it, the tires are still ok, one is making noise probably the one that ran over an nail and was repaired. It seems the seats were wearing out quick at first, but seem ok. We got the big rubber Honda floor mats that really do keep the car clean. So far so good, after over 2 years, we love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear doors open wide, rear seats slide forward for more cargo room. I like how the 5 Speed automatic shifts, it's really smooth. I love the blue led light near sunroof controls that no one can explain what it is, but keeps me warm inside knowing it will glow for many more years. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have about 65 km's on it. First off paint quality is garbage, the hatch has been repainted once already because of rust around the license plate trim. The car is full of rock chips, my sister's '05 Civic had the same paint issues! Had the rear diff fluid changed 3 times at 3 diff Honda dealerships as a 'precautionary service'. They refuse to admit there is a problem. RIDICULOUS!! Still makes a noise! Rear pads and rotors replaced at 45km's! Sometimes the car won't even crank over on the first try. My 94 Accord winter beater has 300km's and has never had any serious issues. Honda better wake up and do something fast because they are losing very loyal customers. They lost us!! Time for a Subaru.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my V new in 07'. It's been a good car with it's versatility, roominess and comfortable on trips and great road manners. But it has had some problems; engine replaced, drive pulley replaced, constant high pitched squeal with AC on at low fan speed (found TSB for- let's see if dealer will honor), and several squeaks and rattles. I've owned other Honda's, including a V, which is still in the family w/ 189K miles, but I don't think this one will last as long. I'm def. looking to trade it in already. I'm not saying people shouldn't buy the CR-V, but I would advise not to expect the same longevity as previous Honda models.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car for the long haul. What Honda fails to tell anyone is they installed a faulty rear differential and rear suspension and that is why the tires wear out by 20,000 miles. Dealerships and main office refuse to fix this problem and your complaints fall on deaf ears. I'm sorry to say the problem still exists in the newer models as well! I'm dumping this car asap and will NEVER own another Honda again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven the CR-V 55,000 in a little over 2 years. This included about 3,000 miles of towing a trailer a max load. Other than routine maintenance (Oil, new tires, etc.) I haven't had any problems. MPG is about 28 highway / 21 in town. I wash and maintain the car regularly and it looks new. I use a leather conditioner on the seats every month. The leather in the driver seat is showing some minor wear. This car has been outstanding.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall I've been happy. Amazing cargo space, comfortable, fun, zippy and good hwy/ok city mileage. My beefs: 1) This thing goes out of alignment too easily although Chicagoland roads are horrible. 12K miles and four alignments! I take the train and my wife works 4 miles from house. 2) Body trim panels are flimsy. Spending $280 to replace poorly designed liftgate trim. Why so flimsy on a "rugged" vehicle. I look at prior models and curse the designer. 3) Paint chips and scratches too easily. I have a 2002 Outback that is wearing like iron and this car replaced a Legacy wagon that I sold for top dollar with 110K in it. I do hope this beast goes the distance like my last Honda Accord.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great little SUV, looks could be improved with front fairing wrap-around bumper (available in Europe). Not good if you need instant response from engine, one time I stepped on the gas and it seemed to take a second or two before it responded, if that is a safety feature it's the most dangerous safety feature on any car, but you get a lot of stuff for the money...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 97 CRV and I really liked it a lot. When the new version came out, I was stunned at how beautiful it was. Nonetheless, I had to shop around, because that'd be crazy to buy the same car again. After looking at everything else on the market, I went back to the 07 CRV and bought it! I couldn't be happier. I love it! (And The green tea color is gorgeous!)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2004 Honda CR-V, loved it, but it rode rough. Bought a 2007 and it was a much better ride, but I have had problems with it. Initially I was having problems with it starting. The worst thing is it keeps wearing the tires out. I was told by Honda it was in the rear differential. I am on my 3rd set of tires at 50, 000 miles. Honda's solution---pay them almost $1,000 for new tires. The main customer service representative was very rude and discourteous. I will never buy another Honda car and will never recommend it to any of my friends again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Less than 10,000 miles I had to to have the rear differential worked on twice, had to replace tire pressure and master tire pressure sensors at this time, the back Windows squeak like finger nails on a chark board when rolling down, the rear hatch has to be slammed shut, causing the plastic cover above the license plate to fall off, the brakes didn't even last up to 20,000 miles, I am now on my second set of pads, I can not drive at a steady speed between the shifts of the because the car vibrates, sensor that has controls the cooling fan had to be replaced, the plastic splash gaurd under to car came apart, the drivers seat is already wearing down, sad to say but I hate to drive this car - don't buy one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 2001 for this, and the change is like night and day; the new model is much less truck-y looking and feeling, and has a much quieter more car-like ride. The gas mileage over my old 5 speed standard is better; with not quite a month of very mixed driving, the mpg is around 27, and an early highway trip hit 29 mpg. The CR-V hugs the road better and feels less skittish than the old model in sharp turns; there is a fair amount of thump and bump over uneven pavement, but still a big improvement. I was waiting for the new model to come out before trading, and it was well worth the wait.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I too did a whole lot of research before I bought this car. I bought a 1996 Honda Accord brand new and I have always been very happy with it. I would have bought the CR-V sooner but I wasn't that fond of the color selections. I have never wanted a red car but purchased the Tango Red Pearl. It is gorgeous! I love the way it rides and handles. The short turning radius, the back up camera! I just can't say enough good things about this car. So far the gas mileage just around town is in the high 20s I wasn't even expecting that.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation and that ability to use voice commands. I haven't tired yet of pushing the button just to ask what the time is to have that woman's voice come back at me. You can change the radio station too with voice commands. Features you would only expect on high end luxury vehicles.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It is almost 6 months and 10,000 miles since I bought this vehicle and just had my first oil change (as recomended by the computer at 15% oil life). I get 29 overall mileage (80% highway and 20% city) and am extremely pleased with my choice. The vehicle has not given me any problems and I have not even had to check the tire pressure due to its own tire pressure monitoring system. The leather seats are nice and the XM radio is a nice way to kill time on longer drives. The air-conditioner is very efficient. During the winter the CR-V was great in 12 inch snow and the heated seats and mirror were very useful. All in all a great vehicle and plan to get for my wife too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM radio. Heated mirrors. Bottle holders in the doors. Conversation mirror and lots of places to keep stuff. The on-board computer that shows the instaneous fuel consumption and trip average has made me a better driver. Day time running lights. Computer tells when service is due.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall I do like the car. It is fun to drive and has surprisingly good visibility (except on backing up). I like the look of the car both interior and exterior. In terms of pts for improvement: car has mediocre pickup. Seats aren't comfortable. I find my back hurts after just 20-25 minutes of driving. I've also encountered a number of problems that should have been worked out prior to release. If not, they should at least be flexible in dealing with the issue but they're not. We bought 2 Hondas at the same time, the CR-V and a Civic. Really wishing we just got 2 Civics. The Civic drives far better and so far has no issues. And it's significantly cheaper.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got my new 2007 Honda CR-V EX after having an Accord and a Civic in past years. I love it! It's about time they got rid of that ugly wheel on the back door! I'm 60-something and thought it would be too big to handle, boy, was I wrong!! It handles very well! It is so comfortable and roomy. I can haul anything now from Home Depot stuff to furniture. Honda has always been reliable for me. My Accord went to 180,000 miles before I traded it in (and I got good trade-in $$) so I expect my CR-V to do the same. Good job, Honda! (especially for getting rid of that wheel 8).)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely love my CR-V EX, but I drive around town all the time and my gas mileage has only been between 15-16 mpg. I expected it to be lower then the EPA estimate, but not 7 mpg. I've had this car for about a month now and the gas mileage has not improved. I had a 1992 Nissan Maxima and got better gas mileage - 17-18 mpg. I'll give it a little more time to "break in" and if it doesn't improve Honda will hear from me. I do love the way it handles and the looks are great. Other then the gas mileage I love my CRV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first crossover/SUV, and I'm lovin the view! Gas mileage is good, average 22/26-28 city/hwy - of course depends on how you drive. Freeway pickup is noticably lacking (it is a 4 cyl!), but once you get past initial on-ramp speed, CR-V drives awesome even going 70-80+ mph. Smooth, feels sturdy, and the handling is excellent. Stiffer handling of Hondas is great, gives more control of auto. Surprised at the power going uphill. Rear hatch is so easy to open/close. Road/wind noise w/closed windows is becoming apparent. Not sure about the automatic maintenance reminders yet. Overall, fun to drive and love the features. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After 364 days my 2006 CR-V was totalled in an accident. I got my 2007 CR-V a few days ago. There are some marked differences between the old model CR-V and the redesigned 2007 one. The 2007 has a much softer, more car- like ride than the 2006, the seats are more comfortable and the engine is more responsive. On the down side there is almost no practical storage in the vehicle, the the cargo nets on the rear of the front seats is gone, the shift knob had been moved to the middle leaving a couple of usless holes where there once was a drawer and box big enough to hold CDs. The passenger underseat drawer is useless to the driver. The flip down center console holds nothing but drinks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought 2007 CR-V LX after driving a Ford Explorer 2-door sport for 10 years. What an improvement! The Explorer handled and rode like a pick- up truck. Parking wasn't very fun with wide-turning radius. The CR-V is smooth, zippy, and easy to park. It's also easier to view out the back window than my Explorer. Gas mileage is better by 10 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my 8 year Lexus RX 300 for a CR-V, hard to let go of the Lexus quality and luxury but I felt that the CR-V was a more economical SUV and was in the price range I need to be in with a daughter starting college in the fall. Was impressed with the 2nd row legroom as myself and daughter are 5'10". The rear hatch is the easiest SUV to open and close on the market. The drive is fine, unfortunately, just too used to my Lexus to be impressed. The price was impressive for the features. Overall, I think that this will be a good car buy for the next several years and that my teen drivers will be safe.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I chose the CRV based on it's balance of safety ratings, interior space, fuel economy, looks and Honda brand loyalty. The fit and finish are amazing (mine is 100% made in Japan), even compared to my 2004 Civic. The step-in height is perfect for my wife and I and there's plenty of room for car seats in the back seat even with a "family visit" worth of cargo (pack and play, stroller, suitcase, etc..). The 166 HP 4-cyl engine has plenty of juice even with the A/C on for a combination of aggressive city, freeway commute and 2-lane country driving. All of the key driving, climate and audio controls are well placed from the driver's position. The ride and handling are superb! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the driver information dashboard - the outside temp/MPG/range display is nice. The MP3/WMA capable 6 disc changer can hold a lot of music if you know how to burn a data CD. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Being new to Hondas, wasn't sure what to expect. I have the most fun driving my CR-V. Like the exterior design, very cute and compares easily to higher end models. Find the interior to be very roomy. Gas mileage is not quite what I had expected for a Honda but still very acceptable (24 hwy/city, 30+ trip). Would like to have more power though mpg would be sacrificed. Find that it shifts to a lower gear more often than I'd like when going on hills. Would still buy it again!</TEXT>

<TEXT>EPA 23 to 27? Was that measured while going straight down hill? Combined freeway and street driving is 19 mpg and that was with the cruise control while on the freeway. Hitting reset after tanking up then driving 10 miles in town displayed 15 MPG, about the same as my 4200 pound VW Vanagon and not even close to a 2001 C280 Mercedes 6 or a BMW 325 6 cyl, both German cars get from 25 to 34 mpg on the freeway. This reminds me, it did get 27 mpg on the freeway but that ended when the first hill was approached, then engine shifted and spun up to 5,000 rpm and the MPG display crashed to the low teens.

<TEXT>First off, it's an ugly car but it's a great car. Function over form is how this car was built. It gets good gas mileage. For those who complain about bad gas mileage, you need to learn how to maximize your mileage. Learning when and how to press the gas and brakes is the difference between 20 mpg and 25 mpg from my experience. Lots of features for the money. Nice interior design. Handling is good, but this causes the ride to be stiffer than normal cars. As a consequence the car stays planted and doesn't float. This is not a car for people who like a sofa ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I went from a 1999 CR-V awd to a 2007 CR-V 2wd 1 month ago. The 2wd was difficult to purchase in nw ohio but they found me one. I've gone from 26-27 mpg to 29+ (1500 miles, warm weather conditions). The ride is much quieter and smoother. The power is much improved and more than adequate. Car runs 2000 rpm at 65. The gas meter (2 trip meters with mpg and and instant mileage gage) is great and accurate. LX basic stereo bass is remarkable, way better the the 99.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love my 2007 CR-V, it's a major improvement over the 2003 EX model I also own. This CR-V ride is more comfortable, controlled and quieter. The interior design/layout is much nicer. Bought the EX-L model, the leather seats are nice, but could be a little more comfortable. The 2.4 4-cyl. engine is fine for most driving, though trying to accelerate in highway traffic to pass other cars is sacrificed. I'm averaging about 25 MPG in mixed driving, which is not bad for this class of vehicle. For all highway driving I am getting 28-29 MPG. So far very pleased with vehicle and would recommend to anyone wanting a compact SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Flexible interior allows seats to fold forward for extra cargo. Didn't think I would like XM radio, but it's nice. 5-speed transmission helps quiet engine noise and improves fuel economy.

<TEXT>I traded in my 05 LX for this car. Love the new styling. I read through most of these postings and I can't figure out it people are driving the same car I am as I am not experiencing any of this negativity with my car. I just drove from Dallas to Nashville and averaged 28.7 mpg! Drive the speed limit and you'll see a big difference. Road noise? My 05 was much louder. I miss the picnic table, but what can you do. It's a great car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage; 6 disc changer; sunroof; dashboard that displays how many miles until empty, average mpg and when to change the oil. Also love the tire pressure monitoring feature (standard). It's SO quiet for a small SUV, especially since it's not a "luxury" SUV where you pay for what you get.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Test drove the Acadia, Edge, and Equinox. Liked the CR-V best out of all based on size and value versus price and the fact that it drives just like an Accord. The car has plenty of pick up if you know how to drive a Honda. Fuel economy is great although less than advertised (EPA estimates are off anyway), but only by a mile or two. The wife loves how easy it is to load up the groceries or all the rest of our stuff when we go somewhere. I fit comfortably at 6'4" and 225 in the front seats and even in the back. Great car for the money and Honda reliability/quality to boot. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auxillary jack for mp3 player/ipod and where it's located in the center console keeps it out of the way, the shelf for the cargo area, the quiet ride (much more than our Accord), and of course the sunroof. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been extremely happy with my new CRV, however, I am disapointed with my actual gas mileage. I purchased the CRV over the Pilot because I believed I would receive better gas mileage. I only average about 21.4! If I would have known that I would have bought the bigger SUV.</TEXT>

This one has really low cabin noise and is peppy to boot. The overall design is appealing to the eye and that is why we chose it over the large Pilot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Most of our driving is in a suburban area of Florida. We get about 24mpg compared to the Honda van that we traded in that got 15-16 mpg. Our highway mileage is about 30 mpg. The engine makes a buzzing sound when driving around town but it disappears at higher speeds on the interstates. We wanted a 4 cyl. for economy and did not like the Toyota RAV with a spare tire mounted on the back. The Hyundai Santa Fe does not get as many mpg and we did not like the red color choice. We added backup sensors and an auto dimming rear view mirror. Dashboard is attractive with instant mpg readout and other info. However, the CRV is not as comfortable as our van was on long trips.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my CR-V about a week ago and I absolutely love it. Everyone raves about how nice this car looks. I got it in Glacier Blue and it's so beautiful - in my opinion the best color this car comes in. I'm already averaging 27 mpg with highway/city driving. I love sitting up high and the visibility is so much better than my old sedan. This SUV handles and corners like a car, going down ramps with tight turns is no problem, however, it does lack in acceleration, but I've gotten used to that. I'm not out racing anyone, but getting up to speed on the highways is tricky. Other than that, I love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my 2007 Honda CRV-EX for about a month now. I really enjoy how it handles on the road. The road noise is minimal and the interior design is great. The only issue I have is with the seats, as most have said, they are not the most comfortable in the world. The new hatchback opening makes it so easy to put stuff in the back. I would recommend this car to anyone who wants a small SUV that is fun to drive and gets good gas mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, my girlfriend and I were all excited to drive the new CRV. It looked so cool with the new design. Of course we expected the reliability and all the nice interior amenities. We were sadly disappointed and we did not let our original anticipation blind us, as some have. Cardboard thin and awkward "captain's chairs" in the front. Skinny bench seats in the back. Hated the missing middle console, and combined with the "captain's chairs" made us feel like we were floating around. No powerseat adjustments in any trim level. Really small gauges and a noisy and wimpy 4cyl. engine sealed it's fate.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the CR-V less than a month ago and I love it. The car is very roomy, especially in the back row. I had three of my guy friends in there and they were pretty comfortable. I used to have a Corolla and parking was easy, but the CR-V can be pretty tough on small parallel parking, if you have the extra $2000, get the back up system with nav. The heated seats are pretty nice. Gas from the three weeks we had it mileage is so so but not bad, just don't rev the car too much because it kills the mileage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Got the CRV LX 4WD for my wife and the baby. Nice little car - easy to drive, enough space for 2 car seats plus a small adult in the back. The car has some great little touches inside, like the reclining rear seats, folding center console, and rear doors that open almost 90 degrees. The "conversation mirror" is kind of a worthless gimmick, however. Two things surprised me, one good, one bad. First, the ride is rougher than I expected, especially in the back seat. However, the little 4 banger they put in this thing was adequate for city driving and a short trip on the highway. With two babies and 3 adults in the car I had no problem getting up to highway speed and merging safely.</TEXT>

After studying and comparing the Toyota Camry, Saturn Aura and Jeep Patriot, I ran into this car. It swept me off my feet. With all the stuff I got it is pretty much the same price as the Patriot but you get the durability of this car and the great fuel economy! Right now, mostly freeway, I'm avg 28.2 mpg! Black on black is fantastic looking plus the Navigation! You can change color of navigation!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation (very easy to use, color changing, nice display clock on screen). Fuel economy for an SUV. Tons of room in back seat which was a great surprise, plus the seats in rear lean back!

<TEXT>Got the '07 CRV AWD as a commuter work horse and it serves its purpose. But after reading other reviews, I wonder if our CR-V is just off. Even after 5000 miles, best I have ever gotten is 22-24 mpg on pure freeway driving with no stop and go. I expected much better gas mileage. Really needs a 6 cyl particularly given the extra weight the AWD puts on the vehicle. Really struggles to maintain freeway speeds (70+ mph) on inclines. Overall, it's a decent little SUV. I guess I can't expect it to drive or perform like a $50K+ SUV. Wish I could tell when the AWD engages!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first ownership experience with a Honda, and so far I love it! What appealed to us the most, other than gas mileage and reputation, was the ground clearance and seat height adjustment. Both of us have some back troubles and most sedans sit too low to the ground. You literally have to pull yourself up of those low seats. But not with the CR-V. It is easy to get in and out of. It is probably the most practical vehicle we have ever owned. I did much research on the internet and compared CR-V with many competitors. None of them matched the CR-V in quality, standard options or price. Love my Honda CR-V!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Handles and accelerates well while still being more economical than V-6 alternatives. Two wheel drive is more than adequate in northern urban areas. AWD would be better for rural commutes in winter or in heavy snow belt areas. Excellent heater and heated mirrors appreciated in Canada. Many thoughtful and functional items in the standard LX model. Our choice was between the Accord or the CRV. Both had nearly identical MSRP. The CRV is much more useful and has Vehicle Stability Assist included. Exceptional feeling of spaciousness for the driver and passenger. Residual value of the CRV has been excellent for many years I never truly understood the whole CRV thing until I bought one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Loved this car when we first picked it up after driving a couple of 10 year plus old cars. But with some time behind the wheel the CRV does have some faults. Seats are uncomfortable, very noisy, cheap interior materials, tire monitor light that comes on when it's cold out, and try rolling down the back windows at highway speed, terrible wind rumble noise. Performance and reliability should be good and of course the safety factor. All in all a good car but not one to fall in love with.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love driving this car! It is very classy, yet practical. The exterior is very sleek and attractive. I have the royal blue pearl exterior with black leather interior. It has a lot of kick for a 4 cylinder. I have gotten a lot of compliments, especially from a current 2002 CR-V owner who now wants to upgrade. I was contemplating buying the RAV-4, but the features available on the CR-V, along with the appearance far outway any other SUV in its class. The safety features are amazing and got me a low insurance rate. I previously owned a Civic and I now only pay $60 more a year, which is quite reasonable. Overall, I highly recommend this car to anyone considering buying a mid-size SUV! </TEXT>

I am not a sort of fast driver so power is more than enough for me. The car handles very smoothly and it is comfortable. Road noise is like other good car.

<TEXT>This is the most efficient vehicle i've yet owned. Great MPG and requires only regular gas and is an SUV at that! Nice turning radius and maneuverablilty, but a little too much braking pressure is needed to stop. Pick up is adequate. Love the nitro gas tires. Wish the armrests were independently adjustible, as I recline more than most others do while driving (don't worry- not so much that I'll sleep). The armrest is stationary (so it rises to a more obtuse angle which means more awkward contact with the steering wheel, despite wheel telescoping and tilting). Love the car so far and my only wish other than the above is that the driver seat be multi-powered, the EX-L be powered.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am not a big fan of SUVs. I test drove this after reading the rave reviews and bought it after extensive research and test driving of cars. The 4 cyl is extremely refined and has adequate power and a decent fuel economy for an SUV. The CRV is extremely athletic and very car like in its handling (felt sportier than the 07 Camry, RAV4 but not as much fun as CX-7). There is some wind noise at highway speeds but it is not very significant. Extremely well finished interior (Camry had uneven gaps in the plastic) and I love the display. Definitely sexier than the boxy 06 CRV. Wanted the Honda reliability and this car has a decent gas mileage. Overall, a great value. Will get Z4/G37 in a few years. </TEXT>

I will be moving to the top of a hill on about 3 miles of uphill dirt/mud/snow, and wanted something higher off the road and AWD.

I am surprised at how nice and fun it is to drive around the city. I am averaging 27-28 MPG with careful driving - mostly highway on my SoCal commute.

Driving experience I was afraid that I might be making a mistake by not buying a 6 cyl. vehicle such as the Toyota RAV4 which was my other choice. My fears vanished when I drove this car out of the showroom and on to the highway. The engine provides easy acceleration and plenty of power. The car handles beautifully, turns on a dime, offers great visuals and is fun to drive. I do not find road noise as described in other opinions to be an issue at all. I find the cabin very quiet.

Car feels like it's on rails and seems as if it can corner rather sharply in turns. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2007 had problems in manufacturing. Within the first 350 miles it had an oil leak. At first it was assumed to be the oil pan gasket. Continue to leak and was found to be the left engine seal. The problem was, they had to wait to get a special part so they could remove the engine in the new 2007's. Apparently, they had not planned on removing the engines so soon. Also, the mileage advertised indicated 23/30 read the fine print. It says, 19 to 26 in town. According to the dealer after the first oil change "we will see". Do not anticipate much more. I am getting about 16.8 in town. Good luck </TEXT>

There is tons of cargo room which is deceiving from the outside. There is plenty of room inside for my family of four. Gas mileage is pretty good so far but I'm hoping it increases a bit more as I break the car in. I only have 125 miles on it thus far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First I must say I was treated very well by Honda Morristown in TN. The reviews are dead on. This is a great SUV!!! More power would be great but I would not sacrifice mileage for it! Change holder and lighted vanity mirrors would be nice as would Home link--but I have to look very hard to find something I do not like about this SUV! Drive one you'll see what I mean!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased a 2007 black on black EX-L AWD model with navigation. I picked it up on the day of a recent snowstorm and driving home from work I knew I had made the right decision. I felt extremely safe. I owned a VW Golf previously and was worried I'd miss driving a manual. That's not the case as the CRV has great pick up for a 4cyl. The handling is great as well. A good guy friend drove it on the highway the other evening and was amazed at how it hugged the turns going at speeds of 75. The navigation system is user friendly and I like the voice recognition, though it's been a little quirky so far. It can take two tries for it to hear your voice correctly. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Living in Wisconsin, I wanted to trade in my Honda Civic for an all-wheel drive sedan. I test drove several, and only decided to try out the CR-V after seeing an ad online. I never intended on being such a loyal Honda owner, but once I test drove this car, I fell in love! Even though it's an SUV, it didn't take much to get used to driving. Within the first week of owning, the TPMS light went on, and my Honda service dept. got me in right away to replace one of the sensors. I didn't think the TPMS was even a necessary extra, but sure enough, it lit up when the temps dropped and Honda checked my tires and filled me up for free. I haven't had a single problem since then.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather seats, heated seats, heat and AC kick in more quickly than my old Civic, automatic volume increase on highway, controls on steering wheel, satellite radio, tons of leg and cargo room, overall look of the car. Also, the AWD has handled the big blasts of snow this winter very well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had it since 9/26/2006. When I signed the contract, they didn't even have a brochure. Honda made me pay the full MSRP :( I wanted white originally but ended up with silver. I have no major complaints. It gets you from here to there without any fuss. (gas mileage is pretty okay... engine power is good enough... what do you expect from honda cr-v anyways?) Some of the features which I'm really happy with are... plays mp3 music, shows oil life %, shows gas mileage avg etc... backseat folding twice to make more room in the back. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall it's a great suv, however, I've had two problems. The TPMS light went on two weeks after my purchase. A more serious problem occurred last week and again today. The front passenger side door has locked and won't open no matter what I do. I can't open it from the outside with the remote or from the inside with the handle. Today the back hatch locked and won't open. I'm taking it in tomorrow to the dealership for repairs. This isn't what I expected from Honda. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My goal was to purchase a station wagon type vehicle for less than $20,000. This vehicle has a lot of value for its price point. Full power options, AC, MP3 stereo, tire pressure monitoring system, airbags all around, stability control...the list goes on and on! I was able to get an excellent deal of $19,999 because of it being front wheel drive vs. all wheel drive. Most people in snowy Maine prefer the latter, but with traction control, I feel there is plenty of grip with the standard traction control. My only disappointments to date are that the "captain's chair" armrest's are too low to be truly useful and gas mileage in mixed driving is running around 20 MPG. I had expected much higher.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The blue LED convenience light! Lots of safety features. High quality interior. Fun to drive. Beautifully designed. Very pretty by my eye. Lots of useful details such as a balanced rear hatch, easy to operate controls with a quality feel to them. Flat floor...plenty of leg room. Three storage bins.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 07 CR-V is a great vehicle. While some claim that the fuel efficiency is not what the company claims, this is largely due to your driving style. The mpg indicator on the dash shows you how your driving is effecting your MPG use...you learn to drive better with the CR-V. I am getting 25 city and 32 highway with the LX model. Interior cloth is very nice and easy to clean. Rear storage space is quite large, especially when you fold up the seats. Outside the CR-V is up to par with other, more expensive small SUVs. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was in love with the previous CR-V, but waited for this one. The ride is very comfortable and handling is decent. The armrest for the front seats are poorly designed. They are fixed and should be adjustable for people who like the seat more reclined. Vanity mirrors are not illuminated even though there are plastic cutouts where they should be. Storage openings are poorly designed, none are covered besides the glove box and center console. Things fly out very easily. Nothing is standard, no roof rack, no fog lights, no running boards, not even a cargo net, and this is the top of the line EX-L with nav. Plan to drop an extra grand for those. I should have test drove a RAV-4</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had been researching small SUVs for a while before I bought the CR-V. My boss is a total car nut and talked me out of getting a RAV4 because he read so many good things about the CR-V. I listened to him and I love it! It has a lot of get-up-and-go for a little 4 cylinder! The gas mileage isn't horrible, better than I expected. It doesn't seem loud to me and I live in a very windy area! It handles beautifully and makes those U-Turns with ease! I got the back-up sensors installed and LOVE them! I wish the seats were powered, and heated. It would have been nice to have heated sideview mirrors as mine get frosty on winter mornings! Overall I love this car! </TEXT>

<TEXT>At first, I liked my CR-V, but as time went by, I don't like it anymore. Poor gas mileage and the noise from the engine is so annoying every time I accelerate. By the way, who designed the 2nd row seat? I thought they are folded and flat like the other SUV's, but they are not. They just tumbles and should be hung by a hook. I can't deliver a long item like a bookshelf, etc. The exterior design is so boring. It was O.K. first, but now it seems like it's just too plain. Seems like have seen it before somewhere.</TEXT>

Found seats very comfortable. Covered 1000 miles one day. I find the road noise on textured pavement and the wind noise is too high. Annoys on a long trip. Was not happy with fuel economy. Above numbers are freeway at 75mph. In hilly terrain and windy conditions the car just needs more power. Spends a lot of time in 4th and 3rd gear. Lockout button on selector should be for 4th gear as well as 3rd.Found it to be very stable in side crosswinds. I think it rides very well for a compact SUV. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our CR-V in December of 2006. Originally we wanted the Royal Blue but had to wait 2 months due to high demand. Now I know why. I don't think that there is any aspect of this SUV I don't like. Ride quality is amazing, view out the front windshield is outstanding, and the gauges are by far the easiest to read out of all the SUVs we drove. We test drove an Escape, but it felt to flimsy in comparison. Lights are very good at night. Despite the size I have been able to haul anything I need to with the seats folded down. The only problem we have had is that I drive it more than the wife and we bought it for her. It's just such a fun vehicle, I can't help it! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Some may not know this but you can fold the front seats back with rears and make a bed. Nothing big but a neat feature. Standard cargo shelf really helps with the groceries.

For only $1K more the CR-V had moon roof, alloy wheels privacy glass and a hundred little gadgets like tire pressure monitoring, extra engine maint. gauges, trip estimates and a better sound system (w/ ipod input jack). The CR-V had better interior than both the RAV4 and Forester and was much much quieter. Was somewhat disappointed in fuel economy. Sticker says 22-27 but I've been averaging about 19 mpg with half city/half hwy driving. Though I took it on a road trip last week and averaged 28.5 mpg w/ cruise on. Also, your not going to win any races with this car. The performance is adequate and responsive but not extraordinary.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Honda and SUV, and I would buy it all over again in a second! There is nothing about this vehicle that I don't like. I bought the LX 2WD model about 1 month ago, and let me tell you, even though it is the base model, Honda proved that they still care about my comfort, and most of all mine and my children's safety! When I bought it, I did not like how the door locks worked, I would have to push my unlock button to get my kids out of the back seat. But , My husband read the manual, and found that this can be changed. I have 5 different options of how I want my doors to lock, and 3 options for unlock! HOW COOL IS THAT!!! Buy This car, you won't be sorry! I LOVE IT !!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have only owned this car for 3 weeks. This is my husband's car to commute back and forth( 60 miles round trip) to work. Lots of room- husband is 6'4 and is able to comfortably drive yet it has good fuel economy. We can put all three kids in the back with ample room. Rear center seat position has head restraint and seatbelt system with a flat floor-no more whining about having to sit over the "hump". The Toyota Matrix did not have the roominess or a true rear center seat position. We chose the LX 4WD CR-V and were impressed by the standard equipment such as ABS with stability assist, MP3 player and side curtain airbags.

The gas mileage is great 22/city, 30 highway but the trade-off is less power that is most noticeable on the highway. If you're more concerned with 0-60 then you want to look elsewhere.

My last car was a Chevy Tracker with 4 cylinders so I was skeptical to get another 4 cylinder, but once I drove it, I noticed a huge difference. The tracker was like trying to push an elephant up a hill. The CR-V isn't like that. It doesn't zip onto the highway like a corvette, but it can get the job done with no problem and sure doesn't feel like an elephant. I love it and it's the best purchase I've ever made.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I decided to downsize for better gas mileage and to afford all the amenities and safety features. I'm so glad I did - I love my CR-V! I get about 22-25 mpg in the city, and 30+ highway (even w/4 people and luggage). This car is comfortable, cute, fun to drive, and handles like a car. The interior feels spacious. The cargo shelf doubles the space for groceries, and the folding/rumble back seats are great for carrying mid-size loads. My kids like that they can recline the back seats, as well as adjust the leg room. There's no a/c vent in the back, but it cools down quickly. Good visibility, and backup camera provide added safety. I highly recommend the CR-V!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded a 2005 altima. AWD needed in the hills of VT even if snow has been scarce this year it will come. First impression is vehicle feels very tightly built. Feels safe and secure. Mileage has been a resonable 25-26 mostly city with some highway during commute. Higher when just highway. Fit and Finish are excellent as usual with Honda. Down side is no storage to speak of in the main cabin area.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dashboard lighting, sunroof, aux jack for ipod, overall design look. Strong handling and decent mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had the car for just over a week now, and I like it a lot. It is very quiet, the handling is sporty, and the build quality is excellent. It's also a lot roomier than the last time I tried a CRV (although that was back in 2001). I had been considering the Mercury Mariner, but the CRV won me over with its good looks, superior resale value and Honda's reputation for reliability. It also just feels a lot more solid; the doors close securely and do not feel as flimsy as the Mercury's.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The new design looks great, and I like the high degree of safety features it comes with. Even stability control, active head restraints and side curtain airbags are standard. Every manufacturer should be so committed to safety instead of making them expensive options or not even offering them at all</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked up our new CRV-EX/2WD this morning and promptly went on a bit of a drive to check the highway mileage. 30.6 MPG at 70MPH. Fit and finish are great, more power than expected. I found the seats very comfy, everything works as advertised including the power moonroof. 6 disc changer works well and sounds very good. There are a lot of things I need to learn about this car though, this is our first import(guess it had to happen sooner or later)</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were shopping for something to replace my 06 Accord that was totaled in a wreck, while at the Honda dealer the new CR-V caught our eye. It wasn't even on our list. I love the new design, didn't care for the old one. There is very little road noise in the cabin. The brakes are excellent. Large cargo area, the seats fold down easily. It is so easy to drive around town, I think the front end may be shorter than the Accord so parking is a breeze. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The redesigned model is excellent. I owned an '03, and find this superior in virtually every respect. Rear visibility is improved; gas mileage is excellent; seats offer solid lumbar support and are comfortable; handling is better than previous, although turning radius is not. Interior is complemented wonderfully by updated materials and thoughtful design, no longer utilitarian. Shifter moved below controls. Space in rear is smaller than previous model. A pleasure for commuting any distance. Undercarriage is also improved with greater ground clearance. The ride is secure with little sway when pushed in tight turns at good speed. Acceleration is good, but needs increased power to be flawless. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Materials are outstanding as are fit and finish. Very impressively engineered overall. Dash is splendid, luminous, thoughtful in design; 17" wheels provide great look. Mileage is terrific as is reliability. The CRV screams upscale, but at the same price as last year. Sound system is great. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The crv rides firm but in a comfortable way. No appreciable wind noise or road noise. The engine noise is noticeable but not offensive. Only thing that slightly irritates me is the gearing in the transmission. The first 4 gears are spot on where you would like them. The fifth gear is TALL, a real road gear in every sense of the word. A fairly large gap between 4th and 5th. Irritation comes when doing 45 mph and it shifts into 5th under light load, only problem is it's only doing about 1500 rpm in 5th and not enough torque at that rpm to do anything and the drivetrain stresses. It does 70 mph at 2100 rpm. Need a pilots license to ever see 3000 rpm in 5th. Sort of wonder why..</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive,25 mpg. jazzy dash, adjustable drivers seat. Quality throughout. EX radio is superb. Rides firm but not harsh. Engine is more than adequate. The EX cloth could possibly be upgraded somewhat, it's just OK. Fit and finish superb.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I decided to wait at least two weeks before writing this review. The car is fabulous. It drives like a car and the bells and whistles are great. I tried out the Toyota Highlander, Chevy Equinox, Ford Escape, Nissan Murano before buying this car. I felt all the other cars drove more like a truck. I was spoiled with my Honda Accord EX V6 and found it difficult in deciding on a second car. Well Honda has another fabulous car that is economical on gas, drives like a car and is a great alternative from a minivan! It was well priced and affordable. I truly have become a HONDA fan after this purchase. So many features come standard with the middle EX model. Honda is a great product.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love being higher up of the road than a regular car. I love the moonroof and the interior spaciousness. I think the trunk shelf is a great feature. Everything is well laid out. The car has great pick up. I am always amazed at how it registers 70 miles with no effort! Love the monitors.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first Honda and it's a fantastic compact SUV. I was trying to decide between the CRV and the RAV4, but went with the CRV.

<TEXT>I absolutely LOVE this car! Roomy for me (I am 6'1") and my 3 kids, very fuel efficient, excellent all- wheel drive (it's fully automatic, no buttons to push - the car kicks in the AWD system as soon as the wheels start slipping). Inside design couldn't be better, very intuitive. The road noise is more than I used to driving domestics, but it's the only "negative" comment I can make about this vehicle. Very impressive! Highly recommend to anyone who wants an AWD with good fuel economy and outstanding reliability.</TEXT>

I have a Karaoke business so I had to give up my Tsx for something with room for my equipment. I was worried that I would not like another auto as much. No worries! It's quite fun to drive. The interior feels upscale and the exterior has character. I also test drove the Rav but don't like the rear door or the spare tire hanging off the back.

<TEXT>The rear Differential broke 2 times within 2 weeks and 700 miles on the car! The power steering is jittery, They also installed the ski rack on wrong and The bike rack is too high on the car to even put a bike up there. This car is nothing but problems and poor design. Also the extended warranty has about 3 pages of what it doesn't cover, and only 1 paragraph of what it does cover and maybe when you will use the $1000 dollar warranty, it may cover a radio now if you're lucky..

<TEXT>Ok, I've only had my 07 CR-V EX for one day, but I thoroughly researched several others (Toyota RAV4 and Hyundai Santa Fe and Tucson) and just fell in love with this car. The dealerships around me sell the cars before the even reach the lot or within 2 days of receiving. I went 2 1/2 hrs away, but had a selection to choose from....and they came down about $1500 from MSRP. I got the green tea EX 2WD and love it. The only thing I don't like is the fold and tumble seats as opposed to "lay flat" seats. I was highly considering the RAV4, but hate the tire on the back and not willing to pay $4000 more for the limited with no tire on back. Honda also has better resale value and slightly better gas.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am not sure if it's me or the car itself. I have driven my Mazda 626 for 9 years now and I never thought I heard other vehicles passing when cruising on a high way at 65mph. But with this new CR-V I could hear every car that I pass and the ones that pass by me. I also think the road/wind noise is more. That's my only complaint. The vehicle feels otherwise very crisp and comfort. The noise is heard only on some highways. If the pavement is a newly done one, the noise is not bad. I think the insulation by the car bosy and the window mirrors are of poor quality. I really expected a nice noise free ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the white CR-V in October. Exterior: 1. Much better looking than the truck-like 2nd generation.

Driver display showing oil life, mileage, and fuel consumption a great tool. 3. Plenty of room, both front and rear. 4. No power driver's seat. 5. XM radio is nice. Sirius would have been better. 6. Seats fold easily. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I believe this is a best buy for an owner of a small-sized SUV. 07-CRV model has all the features for a small family...with a quiet ride, sufficient power, cargo space, and safety features to protect the family. Interior features are very family- centered, and really like the exterior curves of the new model. As mentioned in a previous review article...kinda resembles a Lexus RX330..the vehicle I really wanted. Really like the real- time mpg monitor...will help improve my driving habits considering the price of fuel. The EX is probably the best-buy if you really don't need the leather...but I recommend it if you have young kids. Handling is good, and of course reliability is expected.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior design, interior features to meet small family needs, safety, dashboard layout, XM Radio, leather seats, smooth transmission and humming engine with "adequate" power.

<TEXT>Bought the car 2 days ago, today was the first time on our lousy Hwy 101 in Santa Rosa, Ca. BUT - wherever you drive this car, if the pavement is grooved, usually a concrete road, or if there are a lot of cracks running the direction of travel, this car will be unstable. It's like the rear wheels are loose, it's annoying, I think it's unsafe, when you have many lanes of travel, and it's hard to keep the CRV in it's own lane. I travel this road all the time, my other vehicles do not act this way. And - all the Honda service department says it's the tires, and nothing can be done about it. Great, when I get sideswiped by another vehicle then what? Blame the tires ! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought a 2007 CR-V in November. So far I'm completely in love. It looks great and drives even better. There are so many Wow factors on the 2007 model. I'm not a big fan of the shelf in the back but at least it can be taken out and if I ever need it, it's there. Other than that, it feels like a high end car for the most part </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife purchased this car and overall I would rate it as OK, but not outstanding. The big issue is no horsepower. The CRV's engine is horrible. Throwing a low powered 4 cylinder engine into a heavy SUV body really doesn't give the power it needs to move, especially on hills where it is very noticeable. As for safety Honda is forward thinking but many of the other Japanese SUV's out there have identical safety features. The new styling (interior and exterior) was a much needed change to bring the CRV in line with all the other crossover vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Went in to have headlights changed on my former ('03), saw the new model, and purchased it within a few minutes. The design, both ext. and int., is aesthetically pleasing. What's improved over former design? New dash, loss of spare on rear door (which opens up), handling, shifter below center console, seats are more comfortable, int. space remains approx. the same. Wheels (17") afford a more contemp. look, although the driver's seat is set a tad lower than the former. Windshield is slightly more pronounced in slant; wind/road noise is decreased markedly over previous. Avail. colors are excellent, each most appealing. I had a time of it deciding. Interior storage needs improvement--cen. console</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Design/colors; increased luxury; larger wheels; much more a car-like ride than prev.; handling, ride far more secure; dash (luminous and beautiful) with ext. temp. reading, new fuel gauge (digital); shifter placed below music, as in Element; rear seat more substan.; wheels are killer; outstanding.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It's okay. My wife wanted to upgrade from 2nd gen CR-V, and while it looks slick and new, (she loves it), the vehicle is not as practical or user friendly as the previous model. I find I liked the old swing gate better than the clamshell. The old gate made the vehicle easier to load as you could open the window. There is less storage in the back and the leg room feels more cramped, especially in the back. In front, the giant doorhandles stick out into my leg. I liked the four-spoke steering wheel better on our '04 and while leather abounds, it's not especially comfortable. The stick shift was better on the dash as now it just takes up room. The whole thing feels like a mom car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Initially, my wife and I thought the RAV-4 was our favorite, but after test driving the CR-V and comparing features and price, there is really no comparison (unless you think the V-6 option on the RAV-4 is important.) We found the CR-V to be quieter, interior much more refined and plenty of power from the 4 cylinder engine. My wife enjoys having space for her purse on the center floor beneath the gear shifter pod. Have driven only about 400 miles and the mpg seems be close to advertised numbers. The vehicle has a firm, solid feel on the road and visibility is excellent. I'm thinking that this is one vehicle that we will be keeping for awhile. Wish it had auto headlights, otherwise very happy</TEXT>

<TEXT>I previously owned a 1999 CRV, and have had the 2007 for a month now. It's a great and most worthy upgrade. Ride is smooth and car like more than ever, and the lower center of gravity enhances the handling. Responsiveness and stability is so much improved, esp. when making turns. I initially did not like the exterior, and was largely impressed with interior design. But exterior does grow on you, and do have a better appreciation of the new look. Maintenance Minder is very appreciated for worry free driving. Fuel consumption is improved, though I find that I can get better than advertised 30 on highways, but lower than 23 on city driving. With more city driving, though, only ave. 20mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After a couple hundred miles, we concur: safe, secure, quiet, economical, comfortable, refined and roomy. Everything you'd want in a (S)CUV. We test drove the CR-V during a ferocious wind and rain storm, through standing puddles that would have sent our old Subaru Outback sideways. It didn't even notice them. The AWD was completely transparent, and the brakes felt great. Honda should be congratulated for resisting direct competition with the RAV4/V6 w/third seat. Anything more powerful with additional seats is a Pilot. Save fuel and do less harm to the environment with a CR-V, you won't want more. Just don't let anyone try to convince you that this is a truck. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only owned it a week and love how it drives--so smooth, quiet, responsive. Can't comment on mpg yet. I like the shelf in the back versus a privacy screen that rolls. Very good looking vehicle too. I waited for this new model to come out. My daughter owns a 2004 CRV which she loves but now she is in love with mine, especially the young, sporty look, the better radio sound the 6-CD changer and the moon roof. I was also comparing the CRV to RAV4 and chose the CRV due to the new styling, big door handles inside, and hatchback. I didn't need the moon roof and would prefer back-up sensors, automatic headlights, automatic soft closing of hatch. Still it is great value for the money!</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you consider getting small SUV under 25,000 $ Honda CR-V is definitely worth trying out. Before buying it I checked out Suzuki Grand Vitara and Toyota Rav4 and CR-V was much better for me. The only drawaback for me is that 166 HP engine will not allow you to accelerate really fast. Also do not expect dealer to give you much discount from MSRP as they are selling very fast. In all other respects it is an excellent car.</TEXT>

Acceleration is adequate but a little more acceleration on tap when merging on the highway would be nice. Once at speed it is great. The interior,audio system and gauges are well thought out.

We've had 4 strangers compliment us on the road. The seats are wonderfully comfortable. We got the one that was in the showroom that had the running boards, roof rack, and fog lights already installed (We got those included). The price is definitely reasonable. You do get what you paid for. It's not a Lexus or a BMW that will have more power. BUT it definitely has the luxury feel (for me).

<TEXT>Great vehicle. Always thought CR-V was a good vehicle, but felt the styling on the old ones were a little bit to unrefined for someone my age (mid 40's). Good power for a 4 cylinder. Fuel efficiency has not been as good as claimed (i average 25 mpg and I do about 50/50 highway/city driving). No other vehicle in this class is as practical and as good a value. Similarly equipped RAV4 would have cost me 26,000 as opposed to 23,000. Sure the Rav4 offers V6 and 3rd row seating, but why would anyone look for those things in a small SUV??? and a Rav4 equipped with those things exceeds 30,000(you can get a larger midsize SUV for that price, such as the Honda Pilot)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my CR-V for one week. I traded in my 2005 Lexus RX 330 and was afraid I had made a mistake but after only a week I really like this vehicle. It is comfortable, quiet and has all the power you really need. I also have a 350Z if I want to go fast. I wouldn't want anyone to think this is equal to a Lexus but for the price and economy it is much more pratical for the kind of miles I put on a car in a year. It has lots of storage even with three other adults in the car. It has just about everything you need in an on-road SUV. I looked at others, like the Toyota RAV 4 but none of them matched the CR-V.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the heated, leather seats and the new styling, especially now that the spare tire is underneath rather than stuck on the back hatch. XM radio is really cool.

<TEXT>I traded in my 2004 Honda CR-V for the new 2007 model. I bought the EX Model with the rear spoiler as an add on. The spoiler makes a BIG difference. LOVE the new model. Rides much better than the 2004 with the 17" alloy wheels. The new model LOOKS GREAT! HONDA has a winner with this one...a great price for a really great car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2007 has been totally re-designed inside and out with many improvements. My base of comparison is the 2002 model. Horsepower increased so there's no feeling of being underpowered on the freeway or while passing. Comparing the actual demensions of the two models they're almost identical but the 2007 feels like you have much more interior room. Three adults fit in the rear seat without problem. The new model has a telescoping steering wheel which contains the cruise controls and audio volume, channel and mode controls. Front seats are heated as are outside mirrors. Spare tire is now inside under rear deck and tailgate lifts up instead of swinging out. Shift lever moved to better location.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Improved ride and handling over my 03 CR-V but I miss the flip up rear window. The maintenance minder is kind of silly and it seems that it will be a pain to use. I prefer a written maintenance schedule which is no longer in the owner's manual. The adjustable steering wheel is ok but I usually set it once and leave it alone. The spare sits in the floor well with the valve stem pointed down which means that you have to remove it to check the air. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This review is not intended to offer a long term analysis, as I just got the CR-V yesterday. In a nutshell, the car is amazing. Quiet, fun, handles like a car and quite luxurious, considering the price. I got mine (on the road) for a tad over 27k. Interior is perfection and IMHO, better than the higher priced Acura RDX and blows away the RAV-4, which were the other cars I was considering (the car is actually for my wife). We've been driving it around for two days now, and the fun factor is enormous. The RAV-4 will give you more bang for the buck, but I think other than sheer performance, the CR-V is a much better vehicle. The others aren't even worth mention.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Truly one of the finest suv-crossover entries for 2007. The exterior and interior shines with quality and refinement. One test drive is all it takes. Quiet interior, crisp precise steering. The interior is that of a luxury sedan costing 2-3 times more. Engine is smooth and refined. Don't let the 6cyl. comparisons fool you. Honda's 4 cyl. is responsive, quick and smoother than the competetions 6 cyl's. Highly recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I?ve only owned my 07 CRV for 4 full days and so far I am loving it. With 166 hp, it?s not a car for speedsters, so if you?re hoping to buy a fast car, stick to vehicles with V6 engines. What the CRV lacks in power, it more than makes up with its standard safety features such as ABS, VSA with traction control, EBD, TPMS to name a few. Many have written that the ride is very rough. When driving on uneven roads full of potholes or covered with rough surface, any car will feel the same way. I am not too crazy about the manually operated driver?s seat height adjustment and the limited choice of colors. Overall though, it was sure worth the wait and the price wasn't that bad.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great small suv overall. Ride is smooth overall but can be jarring over medium to larger size bumps. Engine has enough power around the city, but could use more on the freeway or when merging. Interior is nicely finished, but leather is a little on the cheap side compared to a premium small suv (acura rdx, infiniti ex35, etc.). </TEXT>

<TEXT>My Wife and I made a decision when we discovered another child was on the way, that we should get the family a new car. We sold our 2001 Hyundai 300 XL and purchased a 2007 EX-L AWD CRV. We had averaged around 21 mpg with the Hyundai and are now averaging 24 mpg with the Honda. The quality craftsmanship difference for the Honda vs Hyundai is huge. You get what you pay for. I feel much better knowing my wife and two daughters are safe with a very reliable car to transport them throughout their weekly routine. I wish the Honda had more power, but with today's fuel prices the fuel economy is more important. My wife had owned a Prelude before we were married, so she's a Honda Gal anyway</TEXT>

I really like the new cover for the cargo area. I also love having a big car feel but small car gas mileage. I don't find any blind spots, I love the instrument panel, very user friendly. We love our Hondas, never had any problems with them. Can't imagine owning another small suv. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2002 BMW x5 for five years. I bought it new. I have never had a vehicle loaded on a tow truck as many times as the BMW. My wife bought a 2007 Honda cr-v. It was "cute". We went to Florida last winter from New England. We decided to take the Honda, because we had no confidence in the BMW making the trip without issues. During the course of the winter in fla, I became a Honda fan. The gas mileage was very acceptable. The trade-off for comfort was not that noticeable. I trusted the car. I have just sold my BMW x5, and will be buying my own Honda cr-v. It is a great value.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 1995 Dodge Dakota truck for my 2007 Honda CR-V. It's been over a year since the purchase and I'm still very happy. I've owned a 1980 Honda Accord and an 1982 Civic. The CR-V reminds me of the Civic except with all the cool technology, safety equipment, and design upgrades. The handling is very smooth. I can park this thing ANYWHERE! (Unlike my old truck.) I get between 27 and 32 mpg in a mixed highway/city commute 36 miles, 5 days a week(Florida). The mpg meter really lets you see how you are driving. There was obviously a lot of thought put into the interior design of the CR-V. There is storage everywhere. Doors open wider than on other cars. Power plugs everywhere. Buy one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my CR-V for over a year now, and I don't think I could be more pleased with it. I find it very comfortable on long trips (up to 2 weeks / 4500 miles). Mileage has been better than expected, averaged about 30 MPG, with a couple of tanks over 31 MPG, on the 4500 mile trip with some city driving, and I've got the AWD version rated at 28! Another, 2500 mile trip was 29+ average with much driving around Austin. Ride and handling are excellent, but the tires (Bridgestones) could be better. Acceleration is very good for a 4-cyl; haven't ever really wanted for power.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What is a SUV that can get the mileage of a car? The Honda CR-V is the answer. If you're not a lead foot, gas mileage is always in the 20s and can be up to and in excess of 30. An SUV where you can get sunroof, leather, and everything save for the navi under $25k. Drives and handles nice for a SUV. Wish the leather was more plush but this is probably better for long term drives and for your back. Center console is nice. As is three power outlets. Plenty of storage compartments. Can't go wrong with this car. It is consistently a value holder and a reliability champ! Two wheel drive is all you need unless you live in a ski resort or next to the Great Lakes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior is refined as can be. Gas mileage can REALLY impress you at times. Trip computer with fuel info. Good engine. Stock wheels are good as is the radio (just needs more wattage/power). Did I mention the interior? The front end.</FAVORITE>

It is good to see Honda giving a MP3 on all their new models now. The exterior is more like a shrunk version of the Pacifica, but it still looks much better than the old boxy shape.

<TEXT>I'm glad I waited for the new CRV. Was about to get a new RAV4 but did not like the large spare tire on the back. The new CRV looks great and you can't beat the build quality of Honda. One dealership had a $2500 mark-up above MSRP. My dealership never does that and I got a good deal considereing i was getting one from their 1st shipment. The transmission is really smooth - car is extremely quiet. One-touch sun roof can't be heard. Room is fine. Thought I might ge the LX, but the price differnec between the LX and EX isn't all that much. Great looking - gets unanimous praise for looks - really happy with this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow what a difference a year makes! The '07 is a FAR superior vehicle to the previous unit. Much nicer, more refined, quieter and generally more "upscale". I really felt like I was driving a small Acura or Lexus and the power from the 4 banger was great, certainly not fast but perfect for everyday driving on $3/gallon gas when 28 mpg comes in handy. For most families the size is great, the amenities plush, the cargo space ample and fun/practical/cool quotient is just right.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2007 CRV is great on performance and driving. It is smooth and quiet. The build quality is lacking and just by looking through the CRV you can see where Honda has cut corners to save on costs which makes the CRV look cheaper. This is definitely a SUV that is made for soccer moms and women in their 30's. The carpeting and plastic looks cheap and after about a year will wear out unlike the real carpet and plastic from the 2nd generation. I've own this CRV for a week now and wish I could have my 2006 CRV back.I feel the older CRVs will outlast this model. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this little guy to replace our 1992 Accord wagon (totaled from behind!), and it's been a pleasure driving it. The leather interior is very comfortable and of high quality. The only thing I'm *not* keen on is the lack of ability to "punch" the gas when you need a sudden acceleration (and in Miami, which has more idiot drivers per capita than most other cities, this is a *must*). You can give it a slow push and it will accelerate relatively well, but if you try to punch it, it just kind of dies. I guess that's what you get with a 4 cylinder engine: you trade a little bit of safety for fuel economy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car in 2007 and I've gotten nothing but compliments on the design. Smooth ride but weak power on acceleration/. My car mileage on highways is typically 28.1 mpg and 27.8 on city roads (based on 87 octane). Seats could be more comfortable as they are a bit stiff, esp for long distance driving. Love how the back door opens up, not sideways, like the RAV4. One of my complaints is that I have to turn off my front lights manually--does not turn off with the engine. Also when you drop anything between the 2 front seats-around the console, it's extremely difficult to find/retrieve whatever you dropped. Overall, it's a great-looking car with good gas mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When we went searching for a new car, I had my heart set on a '07 RAV4. Husband wanted me to look at a CR-V before my final decision. Glad I did! I'm happier with the fold down table in the middle of the front bucket seats. I'm glad the hatch swings up and not into traffic. I added the removable tray in the back which is a dream after a trip to the store, and the gas mileage is wonderful. I didn't have to change oil for the first time till it hit 8,000 miles! And yes it is true for us, the CR-V was 15% less to insure because it doesn't have the spare hanging on the back. I've driven it for a little over a year now, and cannot find one thing wrong. And I got the entry level AWD!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car needing something with AWD and good fuel economy. I've moved to the country and the roads are, shall we say, challenging. This car has been a gem. It's beautiful and flawless on the roads I navigate through. We've had a tough winter with much rain which turns to mud on dirt roads. One morning going to work in the dark and much rain I turned on the dirt road only to discover it was flooded. I kept going through a torrent of water (yes I know you're not supposed to!) and this car never faltered for a moment. It was like it knew what to do and where the road was. I'm getting about 25 mpg and feel very safe both on paved and unpaved roads. This car is sturdy and nimble</TEXT>

<TEXT>Honda just keeps getting better. The wife has driven this hard for 9 months and 14,000 miles now. I suspect the car is not even broken in yet, still drives like brand new. Comfort and driveability is a strong point. I'm a big 6-1 and after a three hour trip behind the wheel, I feel like I've been sitting on my couch relaxing. A lot of thought went into the details, from the way you can configure the fold down seats to auto open for the moon roof. Every button seems to know exactly what you want to do. Gas milage is surprising for a car with this much room (seats five+stuff) 24 around town, almost 30 open road. Turning circle is crazy tight, feels like you can do a U-turn in your garage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car on October 2006, It has performed to our expectation. I have rented a U-haul trailer and pulled it from Richmond, VA to Livonia, MI (approx. 1200lbs). We love the adjustable rear seats and back rest. The all-wheel drive system performed well in the Michigan winters. I didn't have to worry about switching the system to 4x4. Lastly, the gas consumption has been good. In the city we average about 24 mpg and on the highway about 28 mpg (70 mph). Driving on the highway at 55-60 mph get me above 30 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my CR-V. I was looking for a sedan that would fit our 5 full size family members and would replace my Audi A6 that was always in the shop (frustrating!). After a lot of research I found this fuel efficient, AWD, roomy, fun to drive car that was loaded with features and just happened to be a small SUV. In fact it was such a total package at an attractive cost I saved myself a bunch of money not buying a Japanese luxury sedan. As a bonus I can bring my two dogs along when the 5 of us go out. After 7 months of ownership I am still thrilled with the CR-V. I also have competition from other family members that want to drive my CR-V instead of our G-35 coupe and old Mercedes ML320 SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy, comfortable, attractive interior. Fuel efficient. Very sure footed even in poor driving conditions. Love the build quality.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>1 yr and 12,000 miles later: Overall we like the car. Things that stand out and we like: - smooth ride - mpg meter (instant and average) - service reminder. The issues i can think of are: - very hard seats, butt hurts after 2 hrs of long distance driving - have never achieved the rated mpg, even on hwy. Best case is about 26 mpg on hwy, not sure about city. - base sound system could be improved - interior plastic scratches real easy and is very difficult to remove scratches. - car seems to pull to either side very easily depending on slant in the road. My other cars never did as much.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As my 4th new Honda--all were first year of new generation, 85 Civic, 01 Civic, 06 Civic, 07 CR-V--I knew what to expect: an excellent example of automotive ingenuity with superior fuel savings, exemplary reliability and the best, par none, resale value. Each of these new generations Honda's of mine had their own quicks, some which were never fixed by the dealer until they suggested an alternate fix--the month after the warranty expired of course--like the front strut knocking on my 01 and todays 07 CR-V the strange rattles from the undercarriage at idle and low speeds. Don't get me wrong, I loved all my Hondas but the dealers need to fix the quirks or switch to selling domestics.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling! "Is that a Lexus?" Excellent daily vehicle, nimble, tight, secure, logical design. Versatility: fit much more IKEA/landscaping materials in than any larger Murano/Lexus. Fits extra large dog kennel, seat up or down! 24 actual city (Houston), worst 21, 32 hiway going 58 mph!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've driven this car for six months before deciding to write this review. Overall I'm very pleased with the 2007 CR-V. You really do get a lot of great features for the price of this base model. If you're like me you've done a lot of comparison with other makes and models in the CR-Vs range and of course went through these reviews, which for the most part are helpful. In keeping this short I won't mention everything that's available (you can get that in the vehicles "specs"). Instead I'll mention what I like and what I feel is lacking or could be improved in the sections below. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior design is very sleek and modern.Interior is spacious for a compact SUV, lots of leg and hip room. Rear seats can be adjusted and folded for just about any need. The control panel is simple and uncluttered. Fun to drive although sometimes the engine does sound strained. MP3 and AC jacks rock!</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>So Disappointed</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Bought this as my first new car after driving it in 4 inches of snow and being very impressed at its performance there, and finding a 2007 on the lot in December. Since purchase, have been nothing but disappointed. Terrible gas mileage (21 on mostly highway), cheap radio, slow acceleration, rough ride performance, ridiculuously cheap-looking base wheels, no covered storage in front besides glove boxes, nearly-useless table between seats, uncomfortable driving position, difficulty in seat belting child in with booster seat, and much more had me looking up trade-in value in the first month. This car makes me miss my deteriorating 2000 Taurus with 110,000 miles greatly. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my 2007 CRV for about 3 months and love it. I have owned the 2 previous model styles of the CRV and this one is the best. It looks great on the interior and exterior. I have been impressed with the gas mileage esp. compared to the previous 2 models. I average 22-23mpg in town and have been averaging about 28 mpg on the interstate on long trips. I have used the AWD in the snow and on hilly gravel roads where I live in SD. The AWD appears to work rather well on the snowy roads in our area.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the 6 disk CD changer in this vehicle. It is roomier in the front interior than the older models. The exterior is a major improvement since the prior model was very boxy looking. I get told what a great looking car in many places that I go. I like the running daytime safety light feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I researched for about 2 months, then started searching for the perfect vehicle. I found a CRV and knew this was the car I always wanted. Great style, a Honda dependable. I bought one after looking at other makes and models,but I knew it was to be a CRV. I love the room,we're both tall, I've been getting around 25MPG, I'm not a lead foot. Love the heated seats.I read where someone thought it "putted" around and it didnt have enough horse power. I have'nt found this to be a problem at all. We bought the wood trim for the interior, which looks great. This is our fourth different model of Honda and not our last.I love the style of the exterior. I would recommend this vehecle to anyone.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, heated seats, interior, exterior,easy to get into and out of. The doors open wide to get out of.You just have to stand up to get out. If you had any problems with your legs this would be a great SUV for you. Back wiper,just the whole vehicle its self.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this brand new 07 silver CRV AWD EX . Very Fun to drive. Nice interior design. Very Nice exterior design. Previous car was 03 Accord LX and the CRV has a simlar engine layout. I do most of the minor maintenace myself so its not much of a change from doing maintenace on CRV compared to Accord. Its great they re- designed the way the oil filter is attached as compared to Accord, it is not horizontal, rather vertical, so no messy oil spilling out as much when removing the oil filter. Some say the 4 cylinder is low in power. I don't drive like a nascar driver , but on the freeways, I see no lack of power when power is needed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Vehicle Stability Assistance, ABS, airbags for all passengers. Two tier cargo deck. Simple gauges, engine is easy to work on. Rides like a normal car. Good visibility. Good gas mileage for an AWD - average about 27 mpg when doing 30% city - 70 % fwy and about 29 mpg for 100% fwy</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I were in the market for a compact to mid-size SUV, so we test drove a RAV-4, a CRV, and a Murano. While we were overall satisfied with all three, I found the RAV-4 to be a tight fit for me and the Murano costs significantly more and while it has more power, it is at the cost of fuel efficiency. The CRV rides like a luxury vehicle, gets plenty of power out of its four cylinder, and gets reasonable gas mileage (a little over 23 mpg, combination driving). While my wife convinced me to go with the EX-L, the EX is very well equipped and will save you a couple of thousand.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Picked up this car last Friday. Rear cargo ceiling seat-belt latch cover fell off in-front of sales rep. Disappointed to find no headlight auto on-off feature or Homelink. Armrest got in the way of seat belt latch. No fog lamps and top of head-rest tilts too far forward for my wife's 5' height. Interior design and head-room is excellent. Dash layout is perfectly aligned with driver. My wife pulled down the vanity mirrors and was quite upset to find each mirror without lights. Side-view mirros do not have integrated signals which doesn't make sense given the safety factor built in. Steering connects very "lightly" to the road. Would have liked the tail antenna to be replaced with small dome.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Head-room; interior design; ergonomic dash; XM radio; tilt rear seats; large cabin for size of vehicle. Miles per gallon above 28 average in town. Very reasonable power for size of vehicle. Quality of materials used. Very smooth transmission shifting. Excellent radio tone for level of equipment.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked up my CRV last week. Replacing a beloved 100K+ subie wagon. Tested RAV4, Subie Outback, Prius, Rougue, Accord. Loaded up a pile of camping gear, my 14 year old kid and dogs this weekend. Amazing cargo capacity, great handling and super comfortable. Now as to the critics and some consumers saying the car is under powered. Bull! It moves out smartly, flies up steep grades and passes with confidence on hilly interstates. Nuff said. I'm extremely happy with my decision. 24MPG so far and a great stablemate to my 2002 LL Bean Outback.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handles like it is glued to the road, no body lean. Turning radius. Interior room, cargo capacity, fit & finish & thoughtful features. Controls are all intuitive and quick start manual is great. Fog lights. All weather mats. Drive train is superb for a small engine. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased 3 weeks ago, at 500 miles took a trip from central NC to mountains and back. First leg was from Raleigh to Asheville and down to the foothills (368 mi), MPG w/mtn driving was 29.4. From foothills back home (174 mi) we averaged 33.1. That was w/4 people/luggage, ~ 650 lbs total w/ one stop-n-go section about a mile due to an accident. The sweet spot in fuel efficiency is approx 2100 RPM, about 68 mph. Around town avge isn't quite what I hoped, about 21.5. If you use the mpg computer & the tach, you can get very good mileage with this vehicle. Also, my tires pressure was low about 5lbs, the TPM system tipped me off, when corrected before second leg, saw a noticeable increase in mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mileage computer, proved to be reasonably accurate, great tool to help to get max fuel efficiency. Transmission- very, very smooth - if it wasn't for the tach, it would be hard to determine up/down gear changes. Moonroof - very cool. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first SUV of any size. I downsized from a 4 dr off road F150 and thought it would take a lot to get use to. The CRV feels like a much larger vehicle but handles like a small one. We took a 3k mile trip and it handled great over to mountainous highways with about a 28 mpg average. The navigation unit makes it even more fun to drive. Whenever I get out of it I am amazed at how small i looks from the outside because it feels like a regular size vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car since January 2 of 2007. Perfect vehicle for a family- baby seat fits great (and easy!), room for stroller and lots of pockets/holders. I've also pushed the limits of its cargo capacity (e.g., over 24 30-bottle flats of water without putting the rear seats down!)- still amazed at how much this vehicle holds. Acceleration is OK. A little disappointed with the quality of the metal on the doors-I've had a couple small dents from other car doors hitting mine. Definitely update the tires later-they tend to catch on road surfaces which pushes the car side-to- side. Handles perfectly otherwise-very stable and comfortable.</TEXT>

We just returned from a 7500 mile, 30 day trip. Never stepped out the car unable to move my rather stiff limbs, got 29.3mpg over the whole trip (mostly highway driving but still). Have now 12k+ miles on the car and "did" 2 oil changes at a dealer at a cost of $ 28 each. It is the best overall car I have ever owned and I am officially old.</TEXT>

Being only 5'2", I have a difficult time in most cars with visibility. Not with the CRV. The seat adjustment for height is great! So far I have averaged 27 miles to the gallon.

<TEXT>I didn't fully appreciate my CR-V until I got stuck with a Trailblazer for a rental car. The car is beautiful; this is a vehicle that is comfortable enough for long road trips. The standard features (sunroof, 6 disc CD changer, mp3 jack, multiple storage compartments, etc) are endless. I have the AWD model and get 23mpg in the city. Safety features are top rated. And it's a Honda--you know it'll last! For my lifestyle, (camping, off-roading to get to hiking trails, the dog, the kids, etc.) this is the perfect vehicle.

<TEXT>Took ownership on 9-24-07. The Honda CR-V is a joy to drive. Tested 10-12 other vehicles. It has a smooth, quiet ride and for a 4-cylinder the car has surprising pickup. My first impression of the car was when I opened and shut the door. Solid. No vibrations and no hollow sound. Sounded just like the doors on a Lexus-RX 350. Second impression was when I went for a test drive When the salesman drove the car up for us I thought he turned off the motor Much to my surprise the car was running when I got into it. Nimble and smooth was my experience while driving the vehicle. With Honda's reliability, resale value and the car's gas mileage I don't think I could have made a better choice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation is awesome. Sound system is equally awesome. Lots of amenities for a vehicle under 30,000 dollars. Gas mileage of 22 city and 28 highway would be fantastic. Very luxurious interior. One of the nicest interiors I have seen.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We decided to replace our 2002 CRV LX 2wd after 65,000 trouble free miles with the 2007 CRV EXL AWD. Our only reason for replacement was a need for all wheel drive. We are long term Honda owners and believe Honda builds the most reliable cars on the road with great build quality. With that said the 2007 CRV is much improved over the old body style but that comes at a price of $7600 more than the origianal price of our 2002 CRV. However, the 07 feels like a much more upscale car and we did opt for the EXL package which includes leather and a sunroof. We are quite happy with our purchase and can't imagine a better SUV value. I wish the mileage was a little better as we are averaging 22mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sun roof, leather, ride comfort, smooth linear feel of engine and drivetrain. Many complain the 4 cylinder does not have enough power but I have no complaints with it and fell it is well balanced to the vehicle. I drove Ford's V6 escape and felt it drove slow, harsh and got worse gas mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We were very excited when we picked up the car and were looking forward to long-term ownership of our first Honda.It is very feature rich which played a part in our purchase in addition to the gas mileage estimates. However, after taking it on several long road trips and driving it around locally for several months we decided to sell it. Why? In highway driving, it has a lot of wind noise, feels tinny..not substantial, steering is somewhat loose, it is very underpowered when you try to pass and the gas mileage at best was 26 mpg. In the city the gas mileage average around 17 mpg which was substantially lower than the 22 posted on the sticker. Decided to go back to a Volvo SUV. We tried!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have only had a little while but we really like the 2007 model. We compared it to the Toyota RAV4, which is more similar to the older CV-V, and felt this is a much improved design in many different ways. Appears beautifully put together, with lots of little innovations that really show that they pay attention to detail. I like the gear stick on the dash - keeps the area between the seats clear. No obvious tire noise (as commented on by reviews of previous models). Seems to have plenty of pep on the highway, even when towing a light trailer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A very nice and well thought out car. Everything seems just right. Rear seat leg room and comfort was important for us, and this beat out all the other 4WD wagons we looked at. Safety features and 4-wheel drive are very good for the price. Little noise when moonroof or even windows are open.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm well satified with this car, my first foreign model. The mileage is better than advertised. We drove across the country, 1800 miles and got generally 31 mpg. The pickup is adequate for a 4 cyl. but still would like more hp. I traded in a 275 hp Eldorado on this conservative car so the lack of oomph is obvious. All the standard features are nice, but now I wish I would have gotten the nav. system with all the other upgrades.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought in June, 07, and aside from thinking I'm cursed for buying a new car (I've already been dinged, rear- ended, gently fortunately, and scratched by an eager canine at the dog park), I'm happy to have my first Honda after years of Volvos (finally got tired of the repairs and new ones are budget busters for me). Tried the RAV but like many people, the swing back hatch doesn't work. It's my first Honda and so far so good; decent gas mileage, comfortable for the dogs (and me), and excited about the low maintenance and high resale. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Built in XM and stereo controls on the steering wheel, comfortable seats, lots of leg room in the back,"conversation" mirror, lots of cup holders, the car gets lots of compliments from passers by, comfortably fits my two large dogs, with room for luggage and stuff.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After all I have read about this car, I agree with the lack of hi-speed passing ability, but that is not a major issue for the day to day driving I do. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seats are literally as high as my deriere and easy to slide into</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Drove 2290 miles and put in 91.3 gallons of gas until my last fillup so I am getting 25.1 MPG with about 50% highway and 50% city commute. On the open flat highway driving at 60 mph I got up to 33mpg. This small SUV is quiet, comfortable and has many comfort items like a good stereo, good AC and well positioned controls. This car is loaded with electronic sensors and automated functions, alarms and messages so long term reliability is questionable. Overall quality of finish is excellent. Road handling is very good and does not sway on curves. Engine is not very powerfull during acceleration but gets good mileage. I am curious about the AWD traction on snow and ice in the winter.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Body design, fit and finish, color choices, big rims & tires, pleasure to drive, blue instruments, MPG indicator, AWD for snow in winter, safety features like ABS & six airbags, folding seats and cargo area, optional rubber floor mats, good stereo, driver height and front visibility, good mileage.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>2007 CRV AWD</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>It looks good, performs poorly. The gas mileage is 20-21 mpg City and 23 mpg Highway. CRV has Squeaks & Rattles in car. Vehicle shifts rough from 1st to 2nd from stop, start and go. The dealer says its in electronic program transmission. CRV Pulls hard to right on road at low/high speeds. I have been to a Honda Dealer who says there is a Honda Service Bulletin out Since 01/2007 prior to the car being purchased and requires New Steering column rods/pins to be later installed which are back ordered from Honda so a proper wheel alignment can been done on a new car, what?) I was Never notified by the selling dealer prior to or after purchase, So be alert for that. Noticeable wind noise at 55 mph</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation & curb appeal.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Excellent vehicle! It truly drives better than many cars I test drove. It gets good gas mileage for a 4wd, and its interior is above the class level that its in.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seat comfort, gas mileage, handling for an CUV. Sound system, and exterior presence. Feels like a luxury vehicle in EXL trim.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I previously owned a 2005 CRV. Many terrific improvements in the 2007! Much less road noise! very comfortable and quiet. Radio with Bass boost is great. Love everything about my CRV except I was hoping for better gas milage. Combination city/highway with air conditioning going has been 22 - 23 mpg. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love having floor space in between the front seats by the radio. Place to put your purse. Makes you feel like you have more room. Love the hatch shelf. Easy to haul 4 golf bags!. Lots of storage. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ok, I've had my CRV since July 28th now. I still only have 200 miles on it so haven't driven it a bunch. That being said I think it is a wonderful car and am so glad I finally got it. t's comfortable, roomy and just fun to be in. I've been to the grocery store a couple of times and love how easy it is to load and unload from the back end.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looking for a roomy (interior), compact (exterior),high gas mileage, low maintenace, low insurance (5-star) vehicle that can compete with the luxury brands for just over half the price? This is it. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much with a compact Crossover, but everyone comments on how nice the this vehicle is. How upscale it looks...We've put 3k miles on it in the last month going across the midwest and back. Excellent travel vehicle with 4 adults and all the luggage. Drives like a sedan,(better visability),hauls like a minivan...amazing. We did all the research everyone else did. We went with the CR-V. No regrets at all. Another outstanding effort by Honda.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quality inside and out. Standard feature content. You name it, it most likely will have it (too many to list!) Large interior for exterior size, rear seat room, reclining rear seats, Gas mileage over 30mpg actually recorded! Very intuitive interior. Large front windshield.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really like this car, I used to drive a 2000 Dodge Durango (5.2 liters) and decided to try a small SUV. I am so glad I did it; the CR-V has great style and looks sophisticated, the ride is excellent and firm and I am getting 27 mpg. I wish the dealer had explained about the middle driver console being an option, I do not like the tray it comes as standard equipment since it looks 'cheap'. I would recommend it to any one but I still need to drive it for a fews months yet, but so far is an outstanding machine.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the style, the superb ride and great mpg... it is a winner!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a 2005 TSX that I traded in for the CRV so we would have more space for our new baby. It took us a while to decide what we wanted, but after having the car for only about a week, Im glad we made the choice we did. I love the car!! You get a lot for your money! It drives really well and feel like a luxury car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The one touch sunroof (which my TSX didnt have), everything else is great, but its all very similar to my other car. </FAVORITE>
