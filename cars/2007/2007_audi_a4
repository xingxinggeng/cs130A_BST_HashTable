<TEXT>Owning an Audi has its highs and lows just as any other make out on the road. I have had some fun with my 2007 A4, it is very comfortable for all types of driving. Unfortunately, the FSI motors that Audi drops in these cars are garbage. Power is fine, handeling is impeccable, solid running motor, but HUGE OIL ISSUES. In most of the A4's FSI motor, the rings around the pistons are bad causing oil to burn rapidly right out of your exhaust. Just look at your tailpipes and you will see what I'm talking about. If you look at all the other Audi vehicles, only the A4 has this problem. If you are changing your oil every 1500-2000 miles contact Audi USA for your Engine Replacement.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The front grill is very stylish and gives the front end such an aggressive appearance. The craftsmanship of the interior is flawless, and the audio is uplifting. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just got the car about 5 months ago. It's been great and everything, it drives great. The engine is kind of noisy... The muffler tips get black quickly no clue why.. Mine is automatic. It's fun to drive comfortable and everything. When coming to a stop and it's about to downshift from 3rd to 2nd the car shakes. Also turbo lag at start. Wish it had just a little bit more power. But it's enough. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good sound system. Good handling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought a 2007 A4 Quattro 2.0 used with 18K miles in excellent condition. The car performs like no other car I have had. First, handling & ride are excellent. Fuel economy has been 22 MPG on short trips and around 30 on longer trips. The seats (both leather and power) are very comfy and the interior is very well assembled. Only complaint is the short leg room in the rear seats, but since the kids are no longer at home, it will only be used occasionally. (HINT: If you raise the front seat slightly, you can move the seat forward enough to allow more space for rear leg room. There are 2 trip computers,which were hard to use, but after reading the manual it makes sense. (See below.)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 2 trip computers - I use one for current fill-up and other as a cumulative average and watch how road conditions affect the gas mileage.The auto folding mirrors are great for car washes. Self leveling lights, auto wipers and lights work superbly. Bluetooth phone setup on (Blackberry) was easy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been wanting the car for a while and had the hardtop A4, at the end of the lease nothing sounded better and I was right. Right after driving out of the dealership with 9 miles on the odometer I got plenty of looks on the street. The car, just like any Audi, drives beautifully, their windblocker assures your perfect hair day isn't ruined. I love how fast the top closes and how little of my own work it takes to open/close it, just a touch of my finger. This car also does look great with the top up which is not a common thing for convertibles in today's market. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The build quality, the interior of course, nothing beats Audi with this. I love the automatic top and the feel I have while driving, I feel like a royal person. :)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm constantly having to fool with power window controls. So sensitive it either goes all the way down or all the way up hard to get it right where you want it. Arm rest design is poor and blocks access to cup holders and hand break. Eats oil like there is no tomorrow. Performance is great. Nearest dealer 1 hour away which is a drag. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have to take my car in every 1500 to 2000 miles to have oil put in because the car is burning the oil so fast. This is my 3rd Audi and I purchased this one under the assumption it would be like my others, oil change every 10,000 miles, I was wrong. The dealership keeps telling me this is normal and I don't believe them. I've contacted a lawyer because I want my car fixed before it goes out of warranty and find myself needing to replace a $10,000 engine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Performance is better than expected, quality and finish are outstanding. Multimedia/NAV is the best, only I would add touch-controls. I tried BMW 325xi. A4 is smaller, firmer, more fun to drive (and feels faster). Recommend A4 over the A3 (especially when you buy it with quattro) or A6 (boring...), since I had both for a while before. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the new 2007 A4 on 9/3/6. The manual transmission really allows you to drive this car and as a V4 it gets over 30 miles to the gallon. Driving it (a long way) home in the pouring rain wasn't an issue as the 4WD and the quattro system really helps with handling. Very comfortable interior, top end stereo and tight gear shift make this a fun family car. Take the kids to practice or give it a spin on the country roads with the wife on a Sunday afternoon: both can be fun in this solid family sedan -- the 2007 A4.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been driving BMW's for the last 16 years, but just purchased a pre-owned 2007 A4; the tight ride, the excellent gas mileage, and the bang-4-the-buck were the overriding factors influencing my decision. This is my first front-wheel drive car, which has taken a bit to get used to; other than that, I am still satisfied with my decision.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design and quality (other than the armrest, which gets in the way of the hand brake and cup rests). The fabulous turning radius surprised me -it's better than my BMW 5, and has come in very handy for city parking (u-turns are common to get decent parking).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been real disappointed with the A4 3.2 CVT. I had 3.0 Quattro before and there is no companison. Quattros are what Audi is all about. The CVT transmission is jerky in the 3.2. It is a boring ride. I once tried to accelerate and had a delayed response. It is fast and comfortable but I plan to get rid of it and go back to a Quattro. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought an 07 BMW 328i and got out of it 2 months later. I can't believe how cheap BMW has become and those run flat tires are pure junk. I never drove an Audi until a friend recommended and kept telling me to drive the A4. This thing is solid, tight and drives amazing! The Bose system is nice, but all the speaker and Bose amp are going and being replaced with much higher end speakers and keeping the head unit. Audi is definitely the ultimate driving machine. BMW, I defect!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The A4 Avant is agile on the road and it's a blast to drive. For the price, you really get a lot for your money. Most significantly, I feel firmly tied to the road during poor driving conditions. The sleek look of the Avant puts to rest the popular notion that wagons are boring and unsexy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have the s-line package with the firmer suspension, 18 inch wheels and upgraded leather. I absolutely love this car. We had a 2003 3.0 litre A4 before and we stuck with Audi (instead of buying a 335 BMW) because they are such a great company to deal with and their engineering is beautiful inside and out. I wasn't sure if I wanted the 6 speed manual until I drove it and loved it. It is awesome fun up in the mountains and the gas mileage is way better than our previous automatic. Also no one beats the Audi interior for the money. It is better than my buddy's brand new $90,000 BMW 650i interior. It is an incredible car for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the A4 6500 miles ago. Seats are amazing, you never need to stop on long trips only adjust lumbar on long trips. Fuel ecnomy is excellent but it requires premium as expected with a turbo. AWD combined with winter tires makes this car the best I've driven in extreme winter conditions. Consumer reports rates this a recommeded buy, one of the main reason I purchased it. Traditionally pre-05 audis were not nearly a reliable. My previous car was an acura RSX, a more reliable (I am told) car but not nearly as nice of handling or design. I only hope this car will be as problem free as my Acura was, but I am not counting on it. This is the price paid for nicer handling and design.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Several issues with the vehicle 1) Engine Noise - the car sounds like a diesel. Not Quiet it will bother you. Dealer says that is the injectors 2) Brand new Car that burns oil according to Audi corp the engineering tolerances allow for a quart to be burned every 1200 miles - All I can say is WOW. This is a serious problem that will cause engine failure in the Future 3) The HID Lights vibrate. Taken in on several occasions there is an NTSB release on this safety issue. AUdi wont do anything about it till someone dies. 4) Poor Value. Poor Resale Value. 5) TURBO LAG . . . . Turbo Lag. Step on the Gas Pedal and count 2 missisippi.

<TEXT>After test-driving the 3.2L, I could not settle for the 2.0T. While the 2.0T is peppy, the 3.2 is brute-force power, but with a terrific handling finesse. The exterior lines are sleek and not overdesigned like some competitors *cough*BMW*. The interior is likewise sleek without the BMW austerity or Lexus frou-frou. The engine just purrs, and no matter what your speed, the 3.2 has plenty of power in reserve. The GPS is top- notch, the Bose system is pure concert- hall sound, and the overall design is classic. Amazing how a 10-year-old Audi doesn't look nearly as dated as a younger Lexus, Merc or BMW. Most importantly, I took a broadside hit from a Dodge Ram and was fine. Audi - 1, Dodge - 0.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bose audio system with Sirius, the 3D GPS Navigation is a must-have, quattro handling is unmatched in the rain or even dry pavement. Safety safety safety. I feel totally confident driving this car anywhere. Seats are so comfy, and I'm not what you'd consider to be a well-padded individual.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've been eyeing and dreaming of driving this car for 7 years, you hear me, 7 years! Solid performance, nice handling, luxurious interior, a product of real German engineering. Really does well on turning on sharp curves, it hugs the road. You name it, rain, snow, ice, it's there, 4 seasons in a year! Yeah, it gets bored in the summer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning a 2007 A4 for just over 1 year, I can firmly say that it is a really nice car, but definitely not worth the sticker price of 37K. I have a couple of issues (car stalls for 2-3 seconds while cruising) that the dealership can't fix. I have a couple of rattles that really shouldn't exist in this caliber vehicle. I got a great lease deal 400 a month / 15k a year / 24 months with nearly nothing down. It is fun to drive. It's fairly fast for the base engine. The mileage is good, but varies alot between city and highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently bought my second Audi. This one is an 2007 A4 that I bought as a CPO with 12G KMS. It has a sport suspension with 17 in. MAGS. It is a great combination of style, comfort and driving performance. The 2.0 FSI has a bit of turbo lag in automatic mode but is way less noticeable than in the 1.8T. Frankly, it is no big deal as it is not very apparent and basically disappears in manual mode. Interior is second to none and the handling is crisp and clean. In the process of contemplating this purchase, I have tried out all the competition and came back to Audi because they put everything into one great package.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm big, the car isn't, but all in all it is reasonably comfortable. The AWD 6 speed 2.0 T gives me all the performance that I really need for Canadian winters and driving distances. Mileage is excellent on the hwy in 6th and this car pulls well past the speed limit. I find the fit and finish as good as my previous bimmers but the car is more reliable than my recent X5's and is actually better in the snow. I reccomend this car wholeheartedly - I always enjoy driving it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car for driving around town. Convertable is really fun and in the winter, quattro really gets you through. One issue I have is that on a long trip, the driver's seat becomes very uncomfortable to the point of painful. I have had the pad replaced but it didn't help. I use a towel on the seat for long trips. Additionally, the german car makers need to upgrade their Nav system. Toyota and Acura systems win by a mile!</TEXT>

After switching this car to Audi I don't think I will ever go back to BMWs. I live in Las Vegas so sun is always here and the convertible just makes sense however from now on even if I live in Alaska I still wouldn't mind having the same car.

<TEXT>This is my second A4 and I fell in love all over again. Just like I did when I purchased my first Audi in 2002. These cars are made to last and are only a few dollars more than a loaded-up Camry! I chose this time to forgo Quattro as my previous A4 Quattro "ate tires for breakfast." I'm very happy with the FrontTrack. The 2.0 turbo is almost as fast as my 2002 3.0 and gets MUCH better fuel milage: 32 hwy and 28/29 city. I would reccommend Audi to anyone seeking a safe, efficient, quality auto that provides the driver with the cachet of a German luxury make without breaking the bank!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Only have 2000 miles in 3 months. Visited the dealer on a whim after checking out Saab and VW Eos. VW dealer had a used A4 on the lot. Big mistake. For about the same money as an Eos , I was able to lease a new A4 with Quattro. I feel the value of this car with all its luxury and fit n finish puts all others to shame in this class. It is a second car, so it doesn't get its fair share of outdoor time. I can't keep my eyes off it. It turns heads on the road as well. The Alpaca Beige is really unique and looks great with the aluminum trim. Didn't get all bells and whistles since inventory was limited. Stereo just ok. Convenience pkg is great as are 18" wheels. Just put the top down and grin!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exhaust note is primal. Top operation is clean and hides neatly. Fairly good trunk space. Rear seat tight, but better than Saab and BMW. Kids will manage. 6 speed auto is flawless. Some turbo lag, but quattro helps keep wheels from spinning. Fairly quiet with top up. Great all-weather fun car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving an ML320 for the past eight years, it was a big decision to return to a sedan. We looked at, and drove, many of the SUVs and cross over vehicles but weren't happy with the fuel economy (nor the cost) so we started driving sedans. We bought the A4 because of its proven AWD system in the NE winters. We have 9000 miles on it so far and it's been great. We average 28 mpg, the driving is great fun and it's very responsive on curves, etc. The quallity of engineering is impressive and the service (for the 5k oil change) quick and friendly.

<TEXT>Bought my first German made car. Almost bought a ford fusion but when I really sat down and saw the better engineering, beefier parts, and the technology on this vehicle, the difference easily went away from the v6 opponent. All I can say is I got 36 mpg at 65 mph. 32 driving slow ~45 mph in stop and go traffic around town. Vehicle kicks with the cvt which you can make drive like a regular transmission, but that burns more fuel and well you don't need it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I find out something new on this vehicle everyday. Carlighter in the trunk, door hinges that are cast not stamped. Turbo that really pushes the fuel economy up and gives a super boost of power from 50 mph to 135 within a few seconds on the highway. Too scared to redline it to see how fast it goes!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After months of research, I dismissed the following cars: Saab 9-3, Volvo S40, Infiniti G35, Acura TSX. It came down to the Acura TL and the A4. I bought the A4 because of the ride and I got it for $3K less than the TL. The car is fast, but watch out for turbo lag from a standing start. The quality of build is terrific. I'm getting 30 mpg with 70% hwy driving. The trunk is surprisingly spacious, but a little tight for the driver's right leg. Get the premium package (with leather seats). Great fun all around!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I shopped all the brands in this price point, thought the BMW was too small and cramped, thought the Lexus was just too boring, and the MB a little too 'old'. I like the ride, handling, mpg, price and stereo in this car. The price came in under all the competition and the complementary maintenance was very nice. However, I have not been able to enjoy it since out of the first 39 days of ownership, it's been in the shop for 23 days. I don't know if I got a lemon, or this is indicative of Audi quality. Either way, I do not recommend this car and I won't be buying from Audi again for a long long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one great car. I love how agile it is. Handling is superb and it is a pleasure to drive the car. This car personifies how a true German sports sedan is supposed to feel and ride. The cabin is beautifully designed and the exterior is stylish and curves are eye catching. The mileage I get from this car is phenomenal. The only two things I would like see improved are, the turbo lag and leg area is slightly tight where a bit of wider floor would increase the comfort. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I selected the wood trim instead of the aluminum. The car is very fun to drive, and Quattro is amazing. The fact that you can get it nicely equipped at about 46k is pretty nice too. I had the Premium and Convenience Packages, along with the Bose sound system. No MMI or Bluetooth. However, Bluetooth is pointless in a convertible if you have the top down. The wind deflector and heated seats are invaluable and they help you drive the car a lot later into the year. Digital climate control is standard, a nice touch over BMW or Mercedes. The CD player is an in-dash 6 disc. The changer moves to the glovebox if you get MMI. It also plays MP3 discs, which is handy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently bought the A4 2.0T CVT; previously I had an A4 2001, 2.8 V6. I liked that car a lot, but this new one is more powerful. Even though is 4 cyl, it has 10 HP more than my previous V6. Exterior and interior design is awesome. I got 6 years 100000 miles of warranty (for certified cars only), so I can drive non-stop and have fun. The only thing that my old car has the advantage over the new one is a silent engine noise, I believe it because of the turbo. I like more silent powerful engines, but otherwise everything is just excellent! AAA+++ </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned three VWs before this and so far I'm in love with the A4. I miss the power off the line from the VR6 engine in the VW's I drove, but this is my first turbo and part of it is a personal adjustment. Would I purchase one again, if I had the choice? Yes. I love the way it handles, the ergonomics and interior design are excellent, and the build quality is top notch. I only wish that I had an S4 or an RS4. It leaves me with something to wish for, but that's not a bad thing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The A4 can justify the price and gives the owner a sense of exclusivity. I wanted a sensible economy car, and that's exactly what I got. It's not overly fun to drive, doesn't have drop-dead good looks, but it is reliable, has excellent fuel economy, and the fit and finish set the standard. The Audi is an all around good car, and I have never second-guessed myself for purchasing one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Couldn't help but notice the earlier review about a new engine failure. I brought my 2007 3.2 Cabriolet in for it's 5000 mile service, and when a new engine noise appeared immediately thereafter on the passenger side, Audi replaced the engine, seemingly knowing what the problem was right away. One of the cylinders had an obvious machining defect that the service department kindly showed me. Audi should not saddle the consumer with this enormous market devaluation when an obvious quality control issue like this arises. If you're buying an Audi like I did, thinking I was smarter than all the other people who have nightmare stories to tell, perhaps think again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently purchased a 2007 Audi A4 2.0T six speed with the sport package. This car is simply awesome!! There is virtually no turbo lag. The acceleration is simply breathtaking. It is hard to believe that this car has only has 200 hp. It feels more like 250 hp. The six speed will do 0-60 in 6.5 secs (but feels even faster when the temp outside is between 40 -50 degrees - turbos like cool weather). The passing acceleration is equally impressive. Just drop down a gear and whoosh, the turbo blasts the car forward leaving other cars in your wake. I am also impressed with the handling capabilities of the A4. Many of the components of the sport suspension are borrowed from the S4 and it shows.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car, but it does have a few problems. The biggest problem so far is the fuel economy, granted I live in NYC, but 230 miles to the tank still seems like a bit much for a manual transmission being carefully driven. Now the fun part, at 4,953 the check engine light came on and as I soon found out, the oxygen sensor was broken. This would have to be the first time I have ever had anything break at 5,000 miles, and needless to say I was not pleased. Still pretty happy with the car though, an overall pleasant drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned the car for 6 days and love it! Went with FWD and CVT due to price -- wanted a convertible and this is a 3rd car that will not do heavy duty driving or commuting. For general driving, the FWD is more than fine. Engine is great with 2.0T -- peppy and efficient at same time. Brother-in-law owns '05 1.8T Sedan - drove my 2.0T & says it's much stronger from a standstill. Upgraded stereo with Bose/Sirius is fabulous. Interior fit/feel is intuitive, with lots of little features that make it a pleasure to drive. Top up/ down process is painless and takes less that 30 seconds. Overall, no regrets and the price was right, compared to a used 2006 BMW convertible.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With the new 3.2 A-4, Audi has designed, in my opinion, the BMW-killer. This car outdoes the 3-series in three important categories of performance, appearance, and overall value, with handling being a tie. I'm so glad I kicked in the extra few thousand to get the 6-cyl. over the buzzy little turbo 4 cyl. It was well worth it, as the six gives you an extra 55 naturally-aspirated HP, which is noticeable on hilly roads as well as in passing situations. I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got an A4 2.0T 6MT as my 2nd car due to its attractive lease deal. I wasn't an Audi fan & never like quattro or FWD cars. My previous driving expriences on 1st Gen S4 was so-so only. I was always thought of getting a BMW 3 series as my daily. After I owned this A4 for a few weeks, I fell in love with the new 07 A4. Its suspension is so composed, even with the base 16" wheel/tire setup, the suspension setting is firm yet comfortable. Handling is neutral to very minimal understeer. Overall experience is very good, on par with the last 3 series I drove. The 6MT shifts better than any BMW, period. Now, with $100 lower on monthly payment. I totally forget about the BMW and I'm loving it.</TEXT>

The ride is rather quiet and wind noise is relatively unnoticeable. Fuel economy is a bit less than advertised.

<TEXT>This is my first Audi. I always had an impression of Audi being a ?softer? BMW, and all in all I think I was correct. After having owned many performance cars I was looking for something more comfortable for my long drives so I decided to check out Audi. This is definitely a comfortable car. You get a fair amount of luxury, good performance, great gas mileage, and a beautiful car inside and out for the money; all without the unwanted ?image? the BMW provides, which frankly I got tired of. If you want a more performance oriented car the 3-series is cream of the crop; however, if you want a more compliant German made car the A4 is a great car for less money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 8th leased Audi. Love the brand. The 3.2 Cab is a great car to drive. I've had Porsche and BMW convertibles and nothing can compare to the amazing roof this Audi has. It's canvas, but virtually silent even when driving at 80 mph. I don't know how the engineers did it, but wind noise is kept at a minimum. Handling is much better than the old cabs. It seems stiffer and the turn-in is quicker. Brakes are awesome and inspire confidence. Got it in Alpaka Beige, cream interior and tan room. It's a very nice looking car, even with the new Audi gap-mouth grille. You get used to that fairly quickly. I highly recommend the 3.2.</TEXT>

I find myself wondering why everyone else is driving so slow on the highway. At slower speeds and around corners, the handling is very quick with very little lean.The manual shifting with the 2T package takes some getting used to and, frankly, some practice. The suspension is somewhat stiff but I think you'd have to agree that it is race oriented. The interior is comfortable and "no nonsense". Everything is there and nicely organized around the driver.

<TEXT>What other vehicle in this class offers luxury, performance, safety, cachet, fuel economy, and quality at the price of an A4? BMW arguably makes a superior car, but the value is not there (and how will you know which one is yours in the parking lot?). M-B lacks quality. The Japanese makes don't offer the driving experience of the Germans, and the Americans are sans cachet. To me, the A4 fills a neat niche left by the others with an incredible drivetrain, legendary ergonomics, earth- and wallet-saving fuel economy, IIHS safety cred, and lease deals galore, it's a no-brainer.

As soon as mine went off the warranty it several major failures: headlight switch (common in all Audis), tensioner gasket (huge oil leak demanding entire engine disassembly), instrument panel (dead horizontal lines), and 2 secondary air pump failures. Not to mention the quarterly visits to the dealer while the car was still before 30k to fix check engine light (leaking hoses). This is my last German car. Driving it was lots of fun but I can't deal with thousands of dollars in repairs and repeat visits to the $120-an-hour labor dealer. Buy at your own risk - and read the forums before you do!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my A4 for a month and it handles any curve in any condition. The all-wheel drive is great. I upgraded to the sport suspension and it really makes the ride more firm so make sure that you really want that as the regular suspension is already pretty good and sometimes I think I would not mind a little softer ride although it does allow you to take a corner at 75 and makes it feel like 25. The inside is way better then the BMW or Acura. Great car overall with a great style all its own.

<TEXT>I have had this car for 4 months and every day I seem to find a new reason to like it better than the day before. It is a beautifully refined vehicle and the interior along with the convertible top is a marvel. The engine is smooth although maybe a little noisy and the 6-speed auto transmission is very refined. I wish the gas mileage were a little better, but that is the compromise to have Quattro, I guess. I have pretty much every available option and I think this is the reason the car is such a marvel... nothing to do but drive and enjoy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First type of entry level luxury car. Fun to drive, responsive and comfortable. Would buy again if they continued with this type of quality in the car. Good pricing options and the packages they offer are excellent! They have me hooked for sure, not to mention, it has a decent room for passengers in the back.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stereo system is excellent, one of the best I have heard in a while.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First Audi and after 1500 miles, I'm sold! Couldn't be happier with the drive and feel of the A4. Handles amazing, great gas mileage and an appealing look - both interior and exterior. Test drove the 325xi and not much difference - actually the interior styling and price are superior with the A4. The interior controls take a little getting used to (climate controls, audio, lights, and sunroof control).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, gas mileage, power for a 4cyl and the interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This thing is soo fun. I've had an MB C230 before and it can't even compare to my 07 A4 2.0t. It's really fast with the sport mode trans and so easy to drive while maintaining complete control. Awesome brakes too. Sweet sound system and cool lighting while driving at night. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the sportstronic trans in my baby, also like the awesome gas mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just got the car, so this is my initial reaction review. After I drive it a year or so I'll put in another review. But right now I LOVE this car. The handling is great, the steering wheel (adaptive steering) is a godsend, the color (deep blue pearl) is beautiful, the acceleration is strong and the engine roar is sexy (too bad I'm still breaking it in, so nothing over 5000 rpm yet), and the safety and interior features are very well designed. I personally liked how the manual drove on this car than the 2006 325xi, and the Quattro system is much better. I think this car is a keeper!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering wheel, color, handling, engine power (200 hp feels like a lot!), smooth clutch, safety features, large cargo space (for this size car), beautiful interior full size spare, Quattro AWD system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only logged 400 miles but I am sold on the A4. The car is a pleasure to drive and much sportier than expected. I shopped the 3 series as well and dollar for dollar the A4 just felt like the better package. It is hard to explain but just feels good to drive this car. It has multiple personalities based on the way you shift the automatic but all are enjoyable. I like to use the manual mode to get to speed quickly and then shift to D. The car really rewards you when you hit the back roads it feels stuck to the road but rides very comfortably. As far as the interior goes it is nearly perfect from an ergonomic stand point and I love the bluetooth with my Blackberry 8700. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the red with black leather very sporty. Bluetooth was not on my list but I have found it to be awesome. Seat heaters have already been tested and work perfectly. I have the base stereo and think it is outstanding. Front seats have tons of travel and accommodate my 6'5" son comfortably. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Awesome car that handles like its on rails. The new 2.0T transmission mated with the manual is a joy to drive and has all the power you need. The car's interior is top-notch. All in all, a wonderful car for the price. </TEXT>
