<TEXT>I previously owned a 2005 CTS and loved it. Lease was up so I purchased a used 2.8 with low mileage. Exterior and interior appearance is great as well as the comfort ride, however I just hate the 2.8L engine. I will be planning to get another CTS 3.6 as soon as I can.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned the 05' and newer Accords and Camrys and the CTS is a far better vehicle for the money. It is a beautiful car and not just another "SEDAN". It's sporty and I love it. Not a single problem. Father in-law owns a 2006 and has never had any trouble. So, I decided it was my turn to have one. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats fit me like a glove but softer. XM radio with great features, Onstar has saved me twice after locking my keys in the car. Thanks Guys!!! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great car, excellent accelleration, one of the smoothest cars I've ever driven.Smooth ride and styling,typical of a Cadillac. Color is Thunder Gray, a 3.6 liter v-6 with a chrome wire mesh grill. Wife also loves the and nimble response and the tight steering. We should have bought this car a long time ago.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth shifting automatic transmission,heated leather seats,excellent acceleration and power.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my CTS Sport, it has the 18" Wheel performance and appearance package, handles very well for the size. Not quite as well as my previous Audi and Porsche, but very nice for a larger car. Love the shiftable automatic. Only issue was a broken rear sway bar, replaced by the warranty. Cadillac has an excellent Certified Pre- owned program. (6 years/100,000 miles)</TEXT>

<TEXT>My CTS Cadillac is nothing but problems. Major engine repair at 5 months and issue for over a year. Then again Major engine issue at 19months! The car has been a nightmare and the dealership is even worse to deal with in this regard. I would never buy another Cadillac nor deal with GM. I can't believe the poor level of customer service and then the poor level of quality of the car. I do like the style and look of the car, but it is a poor, poor quality car. It is upsetting as you expect a Cadillac to be the best, not the worse!</TEXT>

<TEXT>First Cadillac I've ever owned - picked it over an Infiniti M35 due to dealer location. Sport model with 18" wheels, limited chrome and spoiler definitely turns heads. For the most part it performs up to its looks which is pretty decent considering its weight and 255 HP. Interior is much improved in the 2008 but very plasticky in the 2007. (Not up to previously owned BMW 740i, Mercedes SL, Jag XK or even Chrysler LHS). Ride is stiff but not uncomfortable; handling very good; braking powerful. Standard 18" summer sport tires abysmal in fall/winter which led to all-season replacement after 4000 miles (at my expense). Overall mileage of 19.2. Next vehicle? Accura or Lexus mid-size SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for about six months now and I love it even more than I did on day one. It's my second car in the entry luxury market, with my first being the '98 328i. I know how much I really love this car because all I want to do is "dress her up" and take her out on the town. My only complaints are related to comfort and interior design. After about one hour in this car I want stop and fix the pain in my back, no matter how I adjust the seats. Our 2002 Camry XLE seating and interior features are superior to the Cadillac which is a shame. We'll never use this car for road trips. This car was a poor choice with two young kids in the back seat. In so many ways, it reminds me of the 328</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Body. Even while driving in this car, my head turns everytime I see another CTS on the road. She (Thunder Gray) is very responsive, and nimble...but not as nimble as the bimmer.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Love this car</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>My family has a long story with Cadillacs. I remember the 1st Seville, and I remmeber how much I loved it. Now I'm in love all over again. This car is fast, agile and a huge improvement over the Caddies of the past. It's so good to see thant GM has finally seen the light. My only regret, I should have waited couple months for the '08, but what the heck, I'm in love!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really enjoy the sporting look and feel of the car as it is very responsive with an excellent turning radius. However, the interior noise is annoying at speeds around 42-47 miles per hour you will hear a slight humming noise. I am going back for the second timeime to have this looked at. I am not happy about the noise level with the inside cabin ride. Just not up to standards of Cadillac.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the handling around turns and corners. XM Radio and 6 disc CD changer is nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great car shows Cadillac understands how to put together great product. Exclellent styling, edgy, unique and attractive. On a cost basis, performance exceeds competitors, and seems a better value. Love the evolution to the '08 as well. Cannot wait to see the new CTS in Thunder Gray with in a coupe next year (maybe GM will do rumored convertible). If so, I may have to trade mine in on a new one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle drives well, but does not reach the EPA mileage. Has the larger engine (not the V-8) and performs well. Noisy inside on rough roads - the combo of shocks, suspension and body results in some annoying reverberation over bumps. There was no plan for the back seat passenger AC - on a par with the cheapest Chevy on the lot. If you want the back seat cooled, you have to run the AC fans on high and freeze out the front seat. Trunk does not have the closer system - it needs a big slam to shut!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice touches inside, nice radio/sound system. Nice road handling too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car because it was American. At first I thought it looked cool, but after 3 months, the styling looks outdated and ugly. The engine is weak and could use some hints from BMW. The interior function is not impressive for the misplacing of buttons. I was going to look at the new CTS but it looks like a 70 year old would be driving it. I am ready to trade it in for a BMW 335, something that will acually make me feel under 60 years old.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Cadillac. My first was a 1986 Eldorado which was pure junk. But Cadillac has hit a homerun with the CTS. I also own a Corvette and the CTS is the 4dr version. This car came equipped with the luxury and sport packages. The styling is bold and is recongnizable a mile away. Performance and handling equal the German and Japanese rivals. It's also equipped with OnStar, XM and a great navigation system. You need patience to program everything but once done it all works well together. Thanks GM</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very impressed with the performance and quality of the CTS. I had been driving BMW's for the past six years but wanted to "Buy American" this time and Cadillac was the way to go. I have the Luxury and 17-inch Sport Packages. The ride and seat comfort far exceed the BMW with only a small sacrifice in handling. It has great acceleration from the 3.6L engine with an automatic transmission. It also has outstanding maneuverability thanks to a super-tight turning circle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The new Sunset Blue color for 2007 really highlights the stunning exterior styling of the CTS. I absolutely LOVE the 2-tone light gray/ebony leather interior. XM Radio is fantastic. And...it's a Cadillac.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is actually my wife's car, but I'll tell you we test drove everything. If you want to fit in and not have your car have a personality go buy the Lexus or Acura. This car offers more room than anything in it's class. The others we tested were fine, but the CTS has it's own personality and was the best overall ride and drive for us. We tested the 328, G35, IS 350, TL, S40, C- and E-Class. Check this car out for it's overall drive. It is a great choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For the price, there are other cars out there that are better equipped. Locking wheel nuts, lumbar support, theft alarm, and rear A/C vents are only available as hefty options. My '96 Taurus and '02 Tribute even came stock with most that I mentioned. Yes, in other respects, this is a fun car to drive. It has plenty of pep, gets decent MPG, handles very well, and has comfortable seating for the most part. Based on this purchase experience (first-time Caddy buyer), it will be my last. Reason? There is more bang for the buck with the competition. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The peppy 2.8 engine and very positive handling make it a joy to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have this car for two weeks now and I am very satisfied with it. I hate when some people write a review on a car without ever owning it. That's just plain hot air. If you are looking for Detroit quality, this is the one. Mine is loaded with all available options including DVD navigation. Two major options are the 17" wheel sport package, which by the way is the only wheel package that you can get with the navigation system and the 3.6 luxury package. I was luck enough to find the car in stock at a dealer in New Jersey. Apparently, not too many are ordered like this one in white diamond with all the bells and whistles. I literally bought this car over the phone. Not to bad for Detroit Iron.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Bose audio and DVD navigation are great, but a bit complicated until you get used to setting them up, not while driving. All the controls are very intuitive and the fit and finish are first rate. If you buy a loaded one, you won't be sorry.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Besides test driving the CTS, I test drove a Toyota Camry, Toyota Avalon, Acura TL, Infiniti G35, and a Mini Cooper. The Mini Cooper won hands down, but I have a wife and two kids...so the Mini didn't win. The CTS won. So why did it win? There was more room in the backseat than in its competitors...which the kids need. I love the exterior of the CTS. I was able to get a 6-speed manual with the CTS. The seats were great...they hugged the body. The interior was not as nice as the TL or the G35, but I just enjoyed the ride of the CTS more than any other car (besides the Mini). I got the CTS sport w/ 18" wheels...I would recommend this car to anyone in the market for a new car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 6-speed manual transmission, Bose stereo (has some kick), sunroof, nagivation system, 18" wheels, and seats that hug the body.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 2007 CTS 3.6L Sport is the most fun I have had since I drove Porches 15 years ago. I didn't know a sport luxury car could be this much fun. The OnStar and XM radio features were unexpected fun and insurance in the case of OnStar. Getting into the car and having the seat and mirrors go to my preset postions is a nice feature. The car has more than enough power @ 255hp ( I didn't get the CTS-V - V8 because of gas mileage). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Independent suspension coupled with solid road control ( I have 18" wheels) and memory package for seats and mirrors. Plus XM Radio and OnStar with hands free phone and monthly car diagnostic email reporting. </FAVORITE>

The performance, acceleration, steering control, and comfort of the ride are incredible. It's fun to drive! I bought mine in "Infrared", which is gorgeous.
