<TEXT>Mileage has been ok at 22 in town and 27-29 highway. Power is great with quick pick-up and easy pull in mountains of Tennessee, and Kentucky. This is a Florida car with good a/c in the summer. Am disappointed with small stuff like a rattle that the dealer can't find - I think it's the exhaust pipe, the dealer installed automatic mirror needing replacement, and the cubby hole door in the dash not staying closed. Surprising for Honda.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V-6 engine with plenty of power. Cruise control does a great job of keeping proper speed both up-hill and down-hill. Low cost maintenance, and the good quality paint finish.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this car because I travel for work. What a mistake! The seats are very uncomfortable on long commutes and there is constant road and wind noise!!! I would not recommend this car for anyone who travels for a living. The ride is too stiff also. I guess this is how Honda makes a separation with Acura. I cannot wait to get another car. This time I will do extensive research before I purchase based on reliability only.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car used with 12,500miles on it and I have enjoyed driving it. With full options, it is a nice smooth ride with comfortable seats, and the ladies love it! I have not had cause to visit the repair shop. Just the regular oil change and servicing. Low running costs. The sound system is very good. My main problem with the car has been the fuel consumption. The best mpg I have ever measured on this car is 5miles per liter (18.9mpg). My worst was 230miles on a full 17.1 gallon tank! Traffic is bad in my area but I still expect better. On rough tarmac, the road noise is very audible. All in all, it's the best car I've owned to date and I used to drive a C220 Benz.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The rear LED lights, sound system, leather seats, the dash is appealing especially at night.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought new in June 2007. Great gas mileage, 26-32mpg it depends on speed, etc. I don't like that the headlights are not automatic. This is the first car that I've owned in the last ten years that did not have auto headlights. The seats are not comfortable after a while. I have taken this car on a few road trips and my body hurts after a couple of hours. It's great for my 30 mile work commute though. I had to replace the brakes at 50k miles. I had a blowout on one of the rear tires at about 40k. I expect both of these things to happen on a car of this caliber. It's not a luxury car but is dependable and does what I need. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Had a problem with the passenger's window that Honda would not fix. The dealer did fix it free of charge. Problem with the power steering leaking when under warranty. No problem found until end of warranty. Honda fixed it without charge because it was noted on the service report during warranty period. Brakes had to be replaced early. Tire had to be replaced at my cost.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Thus far, I'm enjoying the car. I previously owned a Nissan Maxima, but maintenance became too expensive so I opted to buy an old faithful Honda. The gas mileage stinks on the V-6, but it's great that it uses regular unleaded instead of premium like the Maxima. Overall, I like the interior and the stereo system is pretty good too, just wish I could play my MP3 player. It's a fun car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car over the 2008+ models, since I prefer the previous body style. This car has been a delight to own thanks to its responsive engine, nimble handling, well-appointed and designed interior and impressive fuel economy. I've averaged 27.5 mpg in mixed city/hwy driving with the A/C on full blast. Only complaint is a car at this level NEEDS to come with an auxiliary MP3 input jack. I'm not wild about the standard Michelin tires, either. They are noisy and telegraph every pavement joint and bump through the steering column. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Accord new in 3/2007 and it now has 29,000 miles on it. It's been mechanically reliable but it does have minor quirks: dashboard rattles, hard uncomfortable seats, door tape that keeps bubbling/wrinkling up, and weak paint that chips easily. I've had to take it to the dealer several times to get rid of a check fuel cap message that was caused by a faulty evap system in the gas tank. Other than that the car's been reliable. It gives me 28-29 mpg in my commute. Tops is 31 mpg when I drive like a granny. It's a good car but it lacks passion. I have a lot more fun driving my 2001 Firebird and the seats are more comfortable in it too. Still, the Accord is reliable and cheap to feed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned 1999 Accord V6 sedan for 125,000 carefree miles. We sold it at full price to the first person to see it. Decided to try a 4 cylinder coupe and glad we did. Not a big difference with performance/ride(initially a concern) compared to V6 sedan and much more fun to drive. We were looking for value and feel that the premium for the upgraded models is not warranted for our needs. My wife drives a Lexus and has no complaints with this car. I will always drive a Honda, buy one and you will also.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got the base model LX and it came with nice rims, CD and all of the basic options one would need in a car. The car has a great appearance. I love the clean and simple lines and it looks awesome in red. The handling and suspension is far better than any car in it's class. It really feels very Lexus-like on the road. The 4cyl could use a touch more power but it has good pickup and it's very quiet and smooth with the 5A. The only issue I have is the defroster - it takes a long time to defrost...</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our second Honda. My children drive a 2005 Civic LX We have been very impressed with the quality and value of that car, so when it was (finally) time to drive a car again and trade the Suburban, we researched mid- size sedans. All of the consumer claims about the Honda Accord seem to be true. Interior controls come to hand easily and logically (except the airconditioning On button), exterior is very well designed and attractive and build quality is excellent. Rear passenger room is the best of any car we sampled. Seats are comfortable for a long drive, the truck is cavernous and the eng9ine is silent and powerful. All in all, a sober, prudent, great value.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just drove home the 2007 Accord V6 and it is fantastic. The V6 is better than my I30 V6 and nearly as good as the G35. This is my 3rd Accord, had a '93 and '96 before I lost my mind and bought the 01' I30 which was a great value but current G35 and M are overpriced so I went back to Honda. Looked at TSX several times and again not as good as the Accord V6. And did I mention the year end deals...3K below cost...Thanks Honda!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow, I was strictly a V-8 man before purchasing this V-6 Hybrid beauty. I get 35 to 38 mpg highway and around 25 in town. Comfort, style, and great handling in this car. I actually bought two 07 Honda Accords, one for my wife (4cyl) non hybrid and the 6cyl Hybrid for me. She loves her Accord also -- it gets 34mpg hwy. Honda quality and workmanship throughout. Too bad Honda has made the decision to discontinue the Accord as a Hybrid. I really don't think they marketed the car that well. I didn't know Honda built an Accord in Hybrid form until I saw one at the dealership. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I chose the 07 Accord SE over a Camry LE as the Accord has a better engine (VTEC) and to my mind sportier look and feel. I chose the SE specifically since it has the better brakes and tires of the higher-priced models (as well as the six CD changer) but not the luxury accutrements I don't need at this point. I've always been a fan of Hondas and the Accord has not disappointed me so far. There are no surprises--a great look, super reliable engine and superb engineering. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased this car in June of 07 as a 2nd vehicle and have about 5000 miles on it. The ride ride is nice and smooth and no mechanical problems to date. As for the bad stuff....TONS of road noise, Interior function is nice but quality has slipped. Power door switches in the driver door keeps popping out, rattle in the driver door and somewhere in the dash and don't know if Accord owners noticed but light from the glovebox comes through at night with the headlights on. Radio needs serious updating/more power. Seats are nice but with it had more support and adjustments. The engine is smooth but the transmission shifts are rougher than I am use to in other 5- speed automatics.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got my 07 EX-L 2.4L Graphite Pearl. Very comfortable seats, leather is good quality. A bit sluggish out of the gate normal w/4 cyl. On fwy passes with ease and seems to be in its groove around 2500+rpm's. There are 3 things lacking. 1) fog lights should be standard on all EX-L's. 2)Moonroof should fully open without having to hold the button down 3)Door locks should automatically lock when shifted in into drive and auto unlock when shifted into park. All of these features though can be added to the car later if you really need them. The fog lights are readily available and also electronic after market modules for both the automatic door locks and moonroof. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was a 7 yr Honda Civic owner and I really wanted to branch out to something more exciting and sexy; BMW or Volvo. But after months of research and learning what I know about reliability and resale value of these brands, I could not leave Honda. I am very pleased with my honda accord LX 4 cyl manual. I really love the shifting in a Honda, compared to a Toyota, which is more mushy and clunky. A Honda shift is smooth and exact. Love getting a bigger car but still 26/34 mpg. Very happy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>26 mpg in city! I test drove a manual 4 cyl Accord after test driving the Civic Si. I thought, for $4,000 less, I feel I get the same fun factor of driving, and I get a bigger and more practical car(Accord). (Almost had the male midlife crisis purchase of the Civic Si.)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked up a Honda Accord for the wife to drive. It seemed to be a good economical car, but hasn't gotten near the EPA mileage. The six cylinder with the auto is nice, but not as economical as we thought. The interior is well put together and somewhat plush like a 1980's Buick. The parts fit together well and are acceptable for a 25K car. The ride is an anamoly...flaccid yet tinny. Not much of a step up from a Civic. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Previous owner of a 98 EX coupe with 183K trouble-free miles. I hated to sell it, but I needed 2 extra doors. The '07 fits like a glove, handles crisp and tight, and gets great gas mileage. Had to get used to a couple of things from my old Honda like the absence of the change drawer on the left, but there's one in the center in front of the shifter. The radio controls are a little more complex, but having basic volume and channel buttons on the steering wheel are great. An overall well-rounded and well-balanced car. Best of all, no more timing belt! (I think the timing chain was introduced in '03) With the suggested improvements listed below, this car would have no rival. Coming in '08?!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first Honda owned. We also test drove the new Camry but we would have had to buy the v6 due to the v4 lack of power and transmission responsiveness on the highway. We test drove both the v4 and v6 Accord and decided that the v4 had enough power for highway driving so it saved us some money up front and later on with gas mileage. The steering and handling of the car is amazing going around corners and parking. The exterior and interior design is very polished and sporty. The engine and transmission of the v4 is very smooth. So far its been a very fun car to drive! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Among the five Accords and Civics we've owned, this one is the most un-Honda. At freeway speeds, the power train has a gear whine like an old bad differential. It whines under load and is quiet when coasting. So on the flat and level, as the load goes on and off, the whine flutters irritatingly. The acceleration is uneven when shifting from first to second. Over moderate undulations on the freeway, the rear suspension feels loose like the boulevard ride on a big, heavy GM sedan in the old days. The gas mileage barely makes the Maroni numbers (altho we've got less than 1000 miles on it.) The speed related power steering assists too much at freeway speed, and not enough when parking. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I also tested an 07 V6 6MT altima but decided to purchase an 07 Accord sedan v6 6MT 2 weeks ago so I haven't opened it up yet but, coming from someone who's owned 2 5.0 Mustangs, Taurus SVO, and a Grand Prix GTP, the 6speed manual definitely holds its own. I wish others would discuss prices and help future buyers determine a decent deal -- with destination charge i paid 24899, plus 6/100,000 warranty (no ded.) and wheel/tire protection both for 1130. I dealt directly with the sales manager and this was his first offer -- and I always heard Honda wouldn't negotiate. Only modification is K&N drop-in air filter which seems to help some. I'm very pleased thus far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Perhaps my expectations were too high. I have owned three Acuras, which were of higher quality. And three Mazdas, which required no warranty service visits. This car required three warranty service visits before the 18,000 mile point. One for a blocked drain and a rattle in the dash, one for a protective cover in the wheelwell that fell off, and one to turn the front brake rotors that warped at 7K (mostly highway) miles. One of the reasons I paid a premium for a Honda is to avoid these multiple service visits. The brakes are weaker than they should be, and the handling could be somewhat more crisp. I find the ride quality to be comfortable. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fabulous engine - power, sound, and fuel economy (highway), very nice 6-speed manual, quiet and comfortable interior, nice fit and finish. If this car had not been so troublesome so soon, I would rate it much higher. The price is attractive for this much functionality - if it all works.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased a 2007 Honda Accord Coupe LX V6 based on Honda's reputation for reliability and the good looking coupe. It's a strong car, but have discovered quite a few issues: (1) at 300 miles on the odometer, something inside the dash started rattling loudly, (2) when driving slowly (5 - 10 mph), the automatic transmission keeps jerking with a noticeable thud up and down, (3) the suspension is very rigid and you can feel all the bumps, and (4) seats are a bit uncomfortable. The jerky transmission makes me a bit worried that it will fail in a couple years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just bought our 2007 Honda Accord in June of '07, and honestly it is the best vehicle we have owned yet. We had never owned a Honda before, but became interested in their reliability when the 2007 Indy Car series chose to use Honda engines, and have yet to experience a single problem with them. It is amazing. The Accord itself is very sporty on the outside, yet very luxurious on the inside for such an inexpensive base priced luxury vehicle. We owned a Chevrolet Tahoe before the Accord, but do not feel squished or that we have lowered our expectations for a sedan. If anything they have been raised by our Accord! The fuel efficiency is quite close to what Honda estimates. Very Impressive.</TEXT>

Ride is classic Honda: tight and stable, and the quality is super. The four cylinder is more than adequate and gets very similar mileage that my 2005 Civic had. The five speed automatic is very smooth and reads speed and geography superbly. I changed from the Civic to the Accord for safety. The Accord offers a great list of standard safety features. I wish that a customer didn?t have to go to a six cylinder to get Vehicle Stability Control; it should be standard in this day and age. The Brake Assist has a little too much exuberance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We were very excited about our first Honda. Words cannot express how disappointed I am with the car and with the dealership. The rear windows in the car have not worked properly since the night we got it home, dealership has replaced everything except the window pane itself and we are still having problems with it. The car makes a loud whining noise when moving in reverse, dealer claims it's just regular brake noise. Fuel economy is great, but the quality of this car is awful. As soon as my head is above water I'm going back to Toyota. A lot of my friends love their Accords, I think I just got a bad apple, which unfortunately tarnishes my entire image of Honda. Will never buy another.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy is amazing, just went on our second road trip and got 35 mpg hwy. Average 29 in the city. Car is also very comfortable on long trips.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Turned in my Honda Civic lease car with plans to lease another Civic. But the Accord was so much quieter and smoother riding than the Civic. So I ended up leasing an Accord. Love the 6 CD set up. Nice sound system. Manual transmission is smooth. The manual transmission seems to be much better mated to the engine than the automatic. Automatic seemed noiser and rougher. Plus the manual gets a bit better mileage. I average about 27 mpg in mostly city driving. (The Civic did get better mileage.) The engine is silky smooth for a 4-cylinder. Plenty of power. Who needs 6 cylinders? Honda makes great engines. Love the Moroccan red color.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth engine and manual transmission! Plenty of safety features - air bags, ABS. Roomy interior with simple but attractive layout. Nice ride and fairly quiet. Decent mpg - 27. Six CD player. Love the remote trunk release. Excellent fit and finish. Reliability and value. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My last 2001 Accord LX V6 was probably the last best Honda Accord model. I had to trade it in for EX-L V6 and here all my disappointments started. New EX Accord interior design is very good, however leather trim on steering wheel is sticking out on one side, while it's flush with plastic on the other side. The car developed rattling noise somewhere in the rear door or behind it. The car is in repair now at only 300 miles on it. Trunk liner and rear door plastic are cheap and not flush with metal.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Honda and I have had it a little over a month. It has plenty of pep for a 4-cylinder, doesn't lag too much when accelerating I am looking forward to years of trouble free maintenance and reliability, both major factors in deciding to purchase the Accord. Estimated mileage is OK, currently I do 60% city 40% highway and I average 24- 25 MPG. I know the car has to be broke in, so hopefully I will see closer to 30 in the coming months. </TEXT>

I've been getting about 18- 21 MPG. Get this, I travel 85% highway. I'm very disappointed in the mileage. I thought for sure I would at least get 28-31MPG or more since I drive mostly highway.

<TEXT>This was The Right Choice for several reasons. I had it down between a Volvo V50 and the Accord and picked the Honda for mileage and interior room reasons. I have a long commute, so interior comfort and mileage were top priorities. Skip Honda's link for iPod. I had it installed and wrote the dealer that very night to arrange a time to bring the car back and have it removed. Got an aftermarket unit that's half the price and mixes the ease of an iPod with the direct-link sound quality. Great car. Comfortable, practical and keeps its value at trade-in time!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth car. Quiet. Rides much better than the Accord V6 (which I test-drove back-to-back, and expected to prefer). The four-cyl is peppy and gets 5 more mpg!! You'll never miss the V6 below 60 MPH! </FAVORITE>

At first, I was reluctant in considering the Accord but with gas prices on the rise and after doing multiple researches, reading reviews and such, I gave it a try. I've had it for 2 wks now and am enjoying every minute of it. I avg 33.6 mpg mixed driving with A/C, navi, and CD on! It has good acceleration, enough power, smooth and quiet ride. I recommend this car to anyone looking for comfort, functionality and efficiency. Honda has lots of standard features that other manufacturers offer as options. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned this car about 2 months now. Overall I would say the car is OK , but nothing really stands out about it. I would recommend it since it's not a bad car, but this review is basically to point things out that I wish Honda had done differently. I wanted a 2 door car, but nothing really caught my attention while car shopping, and I basically settled on this car (I will drive it until something more interesting comes on the market). I will say that it gets good gas mileage. On straight highway driving, it gets the 34 MPG that the window sticker says, and in mixed city driving I get 26. I think the 4 cylinder engine has enough performance for my taste. I haven't owned it long eno</TEXT>

I couldn't figure how to program the radio presets, or turn down the fan on the climate control yet but I have the bible to read now. Honda hit it out of the park with this one!

<TEXT>This is the best car available in this market segment at this cost, by far. I've had 3 Hondas now, an 02 Odyssey (still own), 05 Accord LXV6 and this 07 EXL. All have been totally reliable, never an unscheduled visit to the dealer. Accords are no BMWs, but do provide a good compromise of performance, price and comfort. The 4cyl (I4) engine has good performance for everyday driving. I rarely miss the power of the 240 bhp LXV6, not as much as I first thought. I switched to the I4 for 3 reasons, EX for LX-V6 price, daughter learning to drive (V6 too powerful), fuel economy. I averaged 26 mpg from the V6 and only average 27.5 from the I4 so far (5k miles), I was hoping for 30 mpg. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had this car for a month now and have found it to be a blast to drive, very powerful and smartly designed interior. Last week in 85 deg heat, car wouldn't start--would turn over, but not catch. Dealer replaced fuel pump sensor module and said that should fix problem, but will it? Prob has not recurred, but only time will tell. Like the fact that it goes over 100K between tuneups, 7500 between oil changes, depending on the conditions you drive in. Beautiful paint job-- got a lot of complements on this car. Car could be better on gas, mileage average--have to use premium or mid range per the dealership. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great highway car, comfortable seats, like the way windows can be rolled up by entering your key in lock. Great handling in wet or dry conditions.

<TEXT>As the current owner of 2 Mazda 6s V6s which I just handed over to my sons to take off to college in, I did not think I would like the 4 cylinder Accord. However, I am very impressed with this 4 cylinder. I have the 5 sp manual (as I do with the Mazdas) and the Honda engine is very impressive. Another thing I noticed is that the Mazdas are more of a driver's car in that they feel like they are going fast around the twisties; however the Honda takes the same curves at the same speed and makes it feel uneventful. After thinking about that I conclude that the Honda is actually the better handler, it just does not make an ordeal out of it. The fit and finish is superior to any car I have owned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Although I am happy with my first Honda, I feel they are somewhat over-rated. The Accord EX-L V6 sedan's ride is very firm and can be punishing on some road surfaces. The paint has some orange peel and is very susceptible to stone chips and scratches, particularly on the front edge of the hood. Some of the ergonomics and features are quirky. However, it's averaging 23 MPG in a daily commute, and it looks great in Nighthawk Black Pearl.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Accords have always been great family sedans. I did expect a little more from mine, but then again, the car is meant to be driven with assured safety and reliability. The brakes warped at 3000 miles and were replaced under warranty. AC fan is loud. Also, a loud thumping wind sound is heard when rear windows are opened ,and rough engine noises when accelerating. But none of this bothers as much as the firm ride. This is the payoff for better cornering, but unforgivable in the streets of New York. Stick with the Camry in cities with many potholes. </TEXT>

<TEXT>A solid car but one that has real but not fatal flaws. Build quality is very high but it does however have some quirks: the engine shut-off feature is too aggressive, especially in common stop-and-go traffic. The battery recharge process that occurs during braking causes a shudder towards the end of slowing to a stop (<10mph to 0 mph) almost like the car is trying to stall (which it doesn't). The steering is smooth and especially easy at slow speeds. Aggressive acceleration is fairly jerky as the motor assist comes and goes as the car shifts gears. Good news - most of this stuff is probably just software fixes. Bad news - Honda let this car out of the lab before it was totally baked.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just received 2 weeks ago my new Honda Accord EX-L w/navi. It is my first Honda purchase after owning a Subaru Legacy. I love the light of dashboard and comfort of leather seats. The interior is amazing and the navi is so user friendly. If asked for same amount of money to choose a navi or a V6 I will opt for the Navi; it adds a dimension to traveling that a V6 will not give you (might be slower to unknown destination). Smooth drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned several Hondas over the years. I have owned LXs, EXs, and CRVs. The '07 Accord has been very disappointing in regard to the ride compared to the previous models I have owned. It is like riding in a log wagon. On bumpy roads you feel every bump and the steering feels unstable. Does not have the solid feel of the previous Accords. Does fine on smooth roads but get ready to get your teeth rattled on bumpy roads at any speed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The four cylinder has nice power and the overall design is well done.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A good car all around for the family. Nothing stands out negatively after a month of driving and 1000 miles. The gas mileage for city driving is close to the sticker (23.5) although that is trying to be easy on the motor during break-in. Performance is very good for a 4 cyl. and handling seems solid. The interior is comfortable and the controls are easy to operate, though the automation of the environmental system is a little complicated. If you just want to "vent" normally you have to check that the A/C is off, etc. My only complaint is the road noise is more than I expected.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had the car for about a year now, it is great! It gets the stated or higher mileage, and the manual transmission is a joy to go through. Heated leather seats are great for those cool days, the XM I can live without, but it's ok. No rattles, tight steering, it is a sport sedan for sure!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got my new Accord last month and it is a wonderful car! The design is top notch, and the 6 speed manual really makes this family sedan into a true driver's car. I would recommend this car to anyone who is in the market for a practical automobile that will give you some excitement when you want it to! The 244 hp V6 pulls strong in all situations and the manual transmission is smooth and easy to operate. The EX also has pretty much any option that you would look for in a car standard! Including leather, CD changer, alarm, power everything, heated seats. It doesn't get much better than this!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I only purchased this car 3 days ago, and I really love it. This is my 3rd new car in less then 2 years and I think I finally have found a great car. I test drove Camry, Milan, Elantra, I owned a 2006 Sonata did not like, On my first gas fill up I got 27 mpg city. Have not been on highway yet. Am thrilled w/gas mileage so far, can't wait to take it on a trip to see what I get. This is a great car, the EX had the features I wanted, the only add on was the Protection Package and I am going to add the auto-dimming mirror at a later time. I highly recommend this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After looking at all the competitors, going with the Accord was a no-brainer. With the navigation, this car feels to me like a true sport-luxury car. The fact that this car is entirely controlled by your voice is just amazing. Although I love the sound system, I find myself not using it so much because I am always having a conversation with the car! I went with the silver/black combo, and added dark tint and the rear wing spoiler to give it a little individuality. I could not be happier with this car. My father owns an 06 Acura TL - and I have to say, this car is SO close to that car. He agrees, and is kicking himself that he paid $6K more for a non-navigation TL! HA! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one of the nicest mid sized sedans out there. It's roomy, quick, nimble, and has some really cool features. We crossed shopped this model with the Camry equivalent and the Accord just blew the Camry out of the water. It's a very nice step up from a 2000 Toyota Camry LE. The V6 is an extra nice feature. I don't know how we ever lived without a V6 in a midsized sedan. The power is always there.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased this car with 122 miles on it and at 800 miles I started hearing a loud popping noise coming from behind the driver. I have had it at two Honda dealerships, for a total of five times and was also assigned a Honda Rep out at their HQ in California. The rep says Honda relies on their dealerships and the dealerships say there is nothing wrong. It sounds like a piece of junk! Honda is not taking ownership for this poorly build car. I wouldn't buy or lease this car, and for that matter, considering the way Honda has handled this situation, I wouldn't buy or lease a Honda again either. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is a pleasure to drive! It has all the power you need to do fast safe passing, to merge onto quickly moving urban highways with comfort and to have a little simple g-force fun. The idle stop engine is great for guilt-free driving on ozone alert days. The car creates its own serenity zone: no engine noise while waiting at stop lights, good road noise damping on rough, patched highways, and one sweet little sound system. I also like the fact that it has 4 cup holders for the front seat and dual climate controls. The fuel economy is quite good for such a powerful, fun-to-drive car. I won't say we're saving money on gas though, because we do more driving just for the fun of it now.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features include the V-6 engine, idle stop at traffic lights, steering wheel stereo controls, the power driver's seat, tilt and telescope steering wheel, 4 wheel double wish bone suspension, 253 effective horsepower combined with 28 mpg city and 35 mpg highway, and heated front seats!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked up demo on 03/13/07 with 5100 miles. Excellent ride, very comfortable leather seats. Car should have headlights that turn on automatically and should have mirrors that dim automatically too. Should have an MP3 plug too. I bet these items will be in the revised 2008 model. I was considering a G35 but it seemed too tight inside and the steering wheel seem very small. Loving my first Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Last October, I was excited to buy this car because I trust Honda's quality. Unfortunately, it is not true. One month after the purchase, I feel that the transmission hesitates when accelerating. Three months later, I always hear a KNOCKING NOISE coming from the front of the DRIVER SIDE whenever I stop or lightly accelerate. This made me very nervous. Now, it is even more trouble. One day, when I tried to break at a sharp turn at about 30 MPH, I could feel that the break suddenly stuck for a very short time. Does anybody have an idea? This makes me very nervous. I am considering trade in the car if the break keeps sticking when taking sharp turn.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is probably one of the best new cars on the market for the 'average' household income. Finally a good car that 'most' people can afford. My purchase was the SE V6 model that offers improvements over my previous 03 Nissan SE, except hp which i'll be glad to make that trade. Road noice in the honda but that's because of the 17" tires that just about every-every- every manufacturer is going to. My 1st honda was a CRX when i was 15 years old and it had 13" tires, guess those days will never come back when you can buy a set of 4 good tires for $200! Should we call that progress?- guess we have no choice. Overall, my hat goes off for the makers of the 07 Honda SE. 5 speed tranny is a plus. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Best overall interior feature is the steering wheel controls! that's only a wish for previous honda models. Also love the daytime running lamps for safety., also the auto off headlamps. 5 speed tranny helps this car get good mileage(major improvement over the 4 speed), hope it holds up.!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased first ever Honda for our family- very nice car great deal in Feb. Only drawback is mileage is not near what was expected. Sticker says 24 city and I haven't had a fill up with mileage above 18.1 mpg yet. I still am extremely happy with my purchase and plan on keeping the car for at least 10 years. Well designed car, good visibility for a shorter person(very few blind spots) I like where all the controls are situated- easy to reach- no looking away while driving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Was expecting all round goodness but was surprised and disappointed by this car. Was not going to buy a new car but the president's day sale made it all worthwhile. I like sporty cars but this car does not know how to smother a sharp jolt. Sends it right to your bone. May be the 17" rims. Steering is stubborn when you just want to make small corrections to your line. The sunroof is so far back that most of the time you will not realize it is there. Access to storage is not convenient, you will have to snake your arm through obstacles and make awkward contortions to access any main pockets. The rear view mirror blocks the sun visor's movement. Creaks and groans. Plenty of blind spots</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Big enough for me. Roomy. Comfortable seating. Corners pretty well. Smooth engine in spite of the 'drive by wire' disconnect between input and reaction. Built better than the Fusion even though the fusion handles better. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After a good experience with an 02 EX V6, I expected a lot from my 07 EX V6. After 5K miles, I'm a bit disappointed. The 07 is a step forward in some areas, but a step back in others. The engine is stronger, and noisier. The automatic shifts more smoothly, but less responsive. Handling has improved and there's less kickback through the wheel, but ride quality has eroded and the steering is less communicative. The 02 was roomy, with a large back seat. The 07 has comfier seats but feels cramped, especially in back. Gas mileage is equal at 23 MPG city. While the 02 was a nice blend of everything, the 07 tries to be more sports sedan than family sedan, and ultimately fails at being both.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sweet J30A5 V6. Heated seats and mirrors, telescoping steering wheel, dual-zone climate control, LED taillights, electroluminescent gauges, outside temperature gauge, 17" wheels, VSA, EBD, curtain airbags, Brake Assist, oil-life monitor, and ambient console lighting.

<TEXT>I traded a 1998 Civic EX for this, so I LOVE the seats- even after 18 hours of driving. Cloth seats may be more comfortable than the leather ones. Love that this car does NOT stand out, especially given my long break-in history. Motor is perfect: Smooth, powerful, and upper 20's in mixed driving. I feel a shudder from 1st to 2nd when the car is warmed up and vibration in tires from 45-65 when temps are 60 or below. The former appears to be caused by a TSB that my dealer says only applies to 03-05 Accords, and I'm guessing the flat spots reported on another reviewer's tires may be what I have on mine. If I can fix the former and confirm cause on the latter I'll keep her. I LOVE that motor!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this since 07 August and this is my second accord and second review. After driving it for more than 40k miles I am noticing some defects. When it's cold it's harder to shift the 3rd gear since mine is a stick shift. Also I hear some rattling noise in the front and and some noise under the stereo. Breaks and the clutch is fine so far and regular oil changes are done at Honda Dealerships. It has a great pickup when shifting gears since its a stick shift. No matter what it is a great econobox even after 40k but wouldn't buy an accord again cos I'm getting bored with this car...By the way 2 months after I bought the car I had to take it back to replace noisy drivers seat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Accord as a certified pre owned from a dealership and have put 15000 miles on it (30000 total on car). Rotors are really useless, had to resurface them even with gentle use. Seats are very stiff and start hurting after couple of hours. There are multiple rattles and noises from within the car and road noise is awfully loud!! I have to turn up the volume to listen to the stereo. Fuel economy is average, I get 26 highway and city combined. Also, there is no easy /cheap way to connect iPod/MP3 player to the stereo, have to buy expensive adapter. Overall, driving is pleasurable (better than Camry), feels responsive & agile but definitely not the best.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove about 40000 miles on this car, and I had almost no problems with it. Excellent reliability, fuel economy, handling in dry and wet conditions. The only thing that causes problems is the new design of the driver's seat. From 1999 to 2007 I drove an Accord EX 1999, and that one had a great driver's seat. The 2007 version has a new seat design, and this caused me a lot of back pain. I already paid over $2000 to a chiropractor. The headrest cannot be lifted high enough to make it comfortable. Removing and discarding the headrest makes it feel better, but this increases the danger of whiplash injury in an accident. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Manual transmission is my favorite #1. Double-wishbone suspension makes this vehicle as strong as a tank: potholes are not a problem. Plus it does not tilt toward the outside of turns in sharp turns like a Toyota Camry. Plus the reliability is just incredible.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Our 2007 Honda Accord EX-L V6 is a great family sedan. We purchased this when the 2008 model year change came out so we got a great deal. I prefer the 2007 to the new Accords as the new ones are much too large in my opinion. Build quality and conveniences are above average. This car really approaches its luxury segment cousins (Acura, Lexus, Infiniti) but not quite. The leather used seems a little leatherette-ish, and parts creak a bit on bumpy roads/cold days. Highway mileage is not so great. I don't drive super aggressively but I have yet to exceed 24mpg when EPA sticker said 20/29.</TEXT>

<TEXT>5th accord 4 cyl. Owned since 1991. Gas mileage great, Cruise set at 75, got 34 mpg on 800 mile trip, after 6500 mile break-in. But some quality issues never had on older Accords - brake rotors shake and brake fade on long steep hills. Even with leather option, seats comfort in front is terrible even on 100 mile trip. I am a serious car collector and insist on quality and reliability, the reason I have been with Honda all these yrs. But Honda is starting to lower their standards, the very thing that put them on top. This is the first time I have ever had reason to question the build quality of this brand car.

<TEXT>18 months after purchasing our 2007 Accord LX, the front-end began vibrating during braking. We took the car in, being that it was still under warranty, and were told that the rotors needed to be turned--the brake pads were fine. Of course, the rotors are not covered under the warranty. I have been told by the dealership, including the general manager, that it is not uncommon for rotors to need turning within 2 years or 30,000 miles. That is absurd, especially given the manner in which the car has been driven. It is obvious that Honda used inferior quality rotors on this vehicle. I wonder what other parts are defective?</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Accord has excellent power and a smooth shifting tranny, very strong stereo and cd player is great. Heat works well can't comment on AC until summertime. The brakes are very touchy and require very little effort, stops quickly and predictably. Fit and finish are excellent but drivers seat is short and doesn't give the support most will need if they are more than 5' 5" tall. Head room adequate for those 6'. Center armrest doesn't extend far enough for me. I can barely use it. The ergonomics of the cockpit are with larger and taller drivers in mind.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2006 & 7 sedan owners check your dash. I had to have the glove box replaced because it was not aligned properly and made a noise. The old one and the new one both have a dimple or sink mark in them. You'll also see one on the lower portion of the dashboard on the driver's side. Honda says that "sink marks are usually hidden by the graining but not on this dashboard. Regarding the question of replacing it with another dashboard, it will have the same type of sink mark so replacement is not recommended." So basically they got junk from their source and we're stuck with it. Another unsightly area is the pass. side airbag, it looks like a sticker was there then removed and left a mark. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Yes indeed very pleased...The drive is smooth with great acceleration surprisingly for a 4 cylinder. It's great on gas (24 city/34 highway). It has a nice subtle and sleek interior metal trimming on the door (black seats/carpet). Overall you get a car with a subtle and sleek design that's economical and will hold its value. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>New design on tail lights are sweet (looks like snake skin when lit), nice interior, new Sapphire Blue paint (my car) is very nice, acceleration, coin organizer in middle compartment, stock theft deterrent alarm, interior design/color. Oh of course, the feature of being able to afford to drive it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this Accord a little over a month ago. I usually don't write reviews but wanted to tell everybody about what a great car this really is. Where to begin: 1) The seats are incredibly comfortable 2) All the controls are exactly in the right places 3) probably the best navigation system I have ever used 4)Smooth and quiet ride 5) 4 cyl provides more than enough power - unless you love speed, lol. I test drove the following cars before settling on the Accord: 07 Camry, 07 Mazda6, Ford Fusion, Nissan Maxima, Acura TSX. All those cars were great but there was also something that didn't sit well with me. The Accord fit perfectly. I've owned many cars and this is my fav!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather Seats are very comfortable, lumbar support, voice navigation is extremely accurate, quiet engine.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just traded in my '02 Civic EX for something a little 'nicer'. It's not that the Civic was a bad car, but if you do a LOT of highway driving then you understand how much of a nuisance excessive road noise becomes. The Accord EXL offers an excellent, smooth ride with adequate power even in the 4cyl version. The body is well insulated and provides much less road noise than my previous Honda without feeling overly "heavy" as some sedans do. The interior feels every bit as nice as our '01 3-Series and offers many of the same amenities, but at a much lower price tag. The transmission is very smooth and the dashboard is a work of art in and of itself. I highly recommend this car to anyone.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hard to list a single favorite feature, but the 'cockpit' of the car is extremely comfortable and stylish. Those who would complain of the sound system in the car being 'underpowered' compared to the civic should consider how much quieter the ride of the Accord is compared to the Civic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have a 2001 EX 4cylinder manual, and it is a very good car with good acceleration. The purchase of the EX V6 manual is "my response" to those drivers who hate being passed and try to accelerate when they are being passed. The 6 speed is perfect for passing and provide smooth and quiet acceleration when zipping around those sour puss as they stomp the gas pedal. The car meets all my performance, safety and passenger needs. As stated before, I wish it had the MP3 jack instead of an IPOD adapter. And for the headlights not being HID...pay attention to the road and it will become unnecessary. The lights are bright enough, but I added brighter lights and adjusted aim and attention span.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got this 07 accord after turning in my 04 accord coupe. I was looking to just upgrade to a coupe with leather, but after looking at the 4 dr I noticed the nice style. And after I test drove it, I realized it was just as great as a coupe. I only wish the tires were a bit quieter and less wind noise. But one has to remember you're not in a vacuum sealed place, and it's not like you are driving a Ferrari or Maybach. Still you cannot beat Honda's quality!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my fourth Honda Accord since 2002. Had a 2002 6 cylinder coupe, loved it but hated the auto. Got a 2003 6 cylinder Sedan w/auto hated the car, suspension was the worse. The 2004 Sedan w/4 cylinder 5 speed totally built in Japan was awesome!! 100,000 miles in 2 years, no problems except for tires. This was corrected w/ Bridgestone LSVs. BUT the 2007, 6 cylinder w/ 6 speed is totally great. Honda did it all with this car! Will change tires soon. Stock Michelins are lame. Would put this car against Lexus IS 250, Cadillac CTS, Volvo, ACURA TSX and more. Thanks for listening Honda, you hit a home run with this car. Got great deal as dealer did not want the 6 speed on the lot. TOO BAD!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6 speed transmission mated to the 6 cylinder in the sedan. Heated mirrors and illuminated steering wheel controls, 17" wheels were needed.Did not really want the NAV system but was only 6 spd on the lot. Now its great having it.

I purchased the Accord primarily because of the interior features: More horsepower and torque, both audio and cruise on the steering wheel, standard 6 CD changer, rear seat folding with lockable pass through, and standard security system. Also, Honda cars are very reliable. I drove a 95 Honda Civic for 9 years. I am getting between 27 to 29 combined miles. One of my favorite feature is the Oil Life Display.

<TEXT>I have the very mixed feelings about this car. I like how it drives. The steering is precise, cornering perfect, acceleration great. The transmission is fine when accelerating, but jerky in slow driving. It up-shifts when it is not really needed. Inside, everything is located logically, easy to use. CD player and FM are good but XM is not. I don?t like climate control because AC and heating are used together for defogging and windshield vents are too noisy. There are intermittent rattles that come in, disappear, and come back again. Suspension of Accord is ?sporty? (bumpy). In overall, I am not completely happy with my Accord. I feel like I drive an oldie car but I still rate it high.</TEXT>

The 3.0 litre VTEC engine married with the 6- speed manual....jeez, this thing is fun to drive. The suspension is sure. The interior is very nice; leather with heated front seats; dual temp controls on the A/C...I can go on. I will...I can get all three of my kids into the trunk with room to spare (joking!). With Honda reliability to look forward to, I have the confidence of knowing that I'll be enjoying this car for years to come. This car is worthy of serious consideration.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I suppose at some point I could drive something other than an Accord... but why? As the saying goes, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." I'm a middle- aged lady, and I have three priorities when considering a vehicle: Reliability, reliability, and reliability. When I get in my car and turn the key, I want it to work. Flawlessly. Every time. For the past eight years, my Accords have done exactly that; so, I leased another one. (I believe this is what the youngsters call a "no-brainer".) I waited an extra two days so that my dealer could find me one equipped with a five-speed manual, which I love. I still get a kick from actually DRIVING a car; especially a really nice one like the 2007 Accord.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Accord Mistake</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I would still be driving my 2003 Camry with 4 cylinder and automatic if the gal with the cell phone had stayed in her own lane! I would be driving a 2007 Camry to replace the 2003 if Toyota had not lowered the headroom by almost an inch! (2003 was the first Camry that fit my long torso). Honda has a good reputation and the 2007 Accord has headroom equal to the old Camry so it seemed like a no brainer but I was wrong. The Honda isn't even close to the Toyota in so many ways. Unfortunately the test drive wasn't long enough for me to pick up on everything. The front seats are way too stiff and narrow...have to drive with wallet out of pants. Highway mileage is 2-3 mpg less than Camry. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It looks nice on the outside but I would rather have an outside temp. gauge as standard equipment. A power seat as standard equipment. Programmable door locks as standard equipment. Dual split rear seats as standard equipment and highway milage that was equal to the 2003 Camry. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did too much research and this was the best choice for my budget. This car has a very high reliability rating. I wanted something that could handle pot holes a little better than a compact sedan and this does that. It's not as good at handling potholes as an SUV but it handles a lot better on the highway than an SUV. You could comfortably travel across the country with four adults and a ton of luggage. The car is very quiet on the highway. I'm sure the V6 is even more quite but this 4 cylinder engine sips gas and has no problem accelerating to get on the expressway. </TEXT>

Hondas look sharp and their engine performance is incredible but they have really let me down on comfort. </TEXT>

<TEXT>For the $20,500 (+usual fees) I paid, this is a great car to look at (in Royal Blue Pearl) with a great engine and sporty handling. I only miss the manual AT shifter to make the experience complete. This is the "sweet spot" in the Accord line up, imo--you get the most car for the least value, but give up some of the bells & whistles. The ride is more sensitive to road imperfections because the suspension makes cornering and maneuvering much more fun than even the 1999 Passat I traded in.</TEXT>

It looks classy and drives sporty,with excellent handling and a very comfortable and well finished interior. I don't think there is a better combination of quality, features, and price on the market. Fuel efficiency will improve once I break the car in. I miss the red gauge indicators on my 05 a little, but the gray/white ones are growing on me.

<TEXT>This is a $30K sedan that actually gives you a lot for the money; it handles well, is fun to drive, gets good gas mileage, has good acceleration, has plenty of legroom in both the front and the rear, the front seats hug the driver and passenger so they don't slide around in higher speed turns, and the 6-disc in-dash CD changer w/ XM radio is decent. The voice commands control the climate control, the navigation system, the stereo system, and the other electronics in the car-- a good thing since some of the manual controls are places slightly out of comfortable reach. At this price, the car should come with Xenon HID lights and Bluetooth. Navigation system is not as good as some portables.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the best car I have ever owned. The climate control system is perfect. My wife sets her side at 78 and I set mine at 70 which makes for a comfortable ride. The engine is a masterpiece and mileage is great. Handling and ride is quick, responsive, smooth and quite. All controls are within easy reach and the lighted controls on the steering are a plus. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It's a Honda! quality, reliable it's going to be. But on another note had three Hondas before this one, and to be honest, I'm kind of disappointed with the Accord LX. The interior looks just like the 1993 civic that I had. They went to basic, on the LX model at least. Not so great for long trips neither. The radio could use some extra amps, it's hard to hear music with the windows down. It seems like the new Civic has more futures and it just looks like it was made in this century. Looking forward to trade mine in for a Civic EX. Sorry Accord LX not so top of the line in my reviews. Hope this its helpful.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very nice, capable and competent sedan. Excellent fit/finish. Had for a few weeks and the Honda quality has been quite prevalent. The 3 L V6 is very zippy and makes this vehicle extremely nimble. Not like a big-clunky sedan. Handles more like a sports-sedan (not high-performance but fairly tight). Have been averaging about 24.5 mpg on regular fuel (mostly highway). The automatic shifts smoothly and is a nice compliment to the whole package. The 17" alloy wheels give the vehicle a nice steering, handling feel and look. No blind spots in all sight-vision views & lines (like some pillared sedans). The graphite pearl coat exterior paint looks very rich. Thought this was a better car than Camry. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>3L V6 is fun (powerful & economical). Steering mounted stereo/cruise controls is a nice feature. Handy/functional cup holders (front and rear). Like the daytime running lights safety feature. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After a dealer buy back of my 2005 Dodge Magnum Hemi I was looking forward to getting the Accord. It was a come down from 340 HP to 244 but well worth the trade. Great materials and built quality. Classy interior, good acceleration for a V6, not as good as the 07 Camry but the styling is cleaner and built quality better. I was concerned about the many recent Toyota recalls. Also to get comparable equipment the Camry would have been thousands more. I can't wait for the redo in 2008. Hope the styling will be a little more radical, with keyless remote, push button start and a few more horsepower.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Accelerates powerful and smooth.The five speed auto shifts aggressively, and handling is second to none.Very quiet and no rattles going over bumps.I've had mine up to 105 m.p.h. on the expressway and no vibration or excessive noise in the interior, just the sound of the 3.0L V-6 purring along at 3000 r.p.m.. Exterior styling is attractive,dual exhaust, body panels,rear digital tail lights and so on, all designed very well.Interior is nicely laid out. Speedo and guages as well as stereo and climate controls are all easy to reach and read. One exception is on the passenger side of the dashboard, I can see the cutout where air bag would deploy.This is my first Japanese car,and so far so good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car since late August and I love it. I will start first with the engine and trans. They claim it has 244 hp and I have no reason to doubt. Performance is quite peppy for this class with the 6-spd. The internal design is great except for 2 things. First there is no Aux input for regular MP3 players. I don't have an IPod so their IPod adapter is worthless, forcing me to buy a $100 Blitzsafe aux adapter. Next the Deck shows the auto climate control on it so if you replace the deck you can't see the temp you set. Ride is comfortable and quiet (not Toyota quiet, better then Detroit's offerings) handles corners quite nice. Lastly is look, I love it, some don't.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am loving this car! This is a first Honda for me, but won't be my last! In my very recent contemplation of a new car purchase, I thought I was set on another manufacturer, until I had the opportunity to test drive an Accord. After having owned 3 used vehicles, I wanted to get the best that I could afford on my debut new car purchase. I couldn't have chosen better. Sweet ride, roomy interior, nice body styling. Although I've never owned a new car before, I've been both driver and passenger of many, so I knew what I wanted, and what it should look and feel like and Honda Accord does not dissappoint. Honda doesn't manufacture cars, they engineer them.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love everything, but the steering wheel audio controls are really nice. the cup holders, the spacious trunk, the valet key. Rolling down the windows with the remote is nice. Honda "Owner's link" is a nice touch. I also like the solid feel of the car as well as the handling. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned 6 previous Accords ('95, '98, '99, '01, 02, and '04), and this is by far the best. The perfect build quality reflects that it is in the last year of this body style. I tried buying an 06 civic prior to this purchase but found many design flaws and rattles, and poor grade interior materials to be disappointing. I am sticking to Accords. Accords represent the best compromise between cost, fuel economy, practicality, and quality. If you are driving in an urban setting, there is not my difference in fuel mileage between a Civic and an Accord-- 28 mpg vs 25 mpg. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I cannot say enough about the 2007 Honda Accord. I traded in my 2003 at the dealership where I purchased it. I was not intending to buy a new one just wanted to perhaps test drive a 2005 or 06. This dealership was out of stock on older models. Then this stunning 2007 caught my eye on the dealership floor, Bronze exterior, leather inside, sunvisor, and spoiler, hot looking wheels, need I say more. I had to test drive this baby. To me there was no difference between the power of my previous 2003 ex-v6 and this one. I drove it home that night after what I thought was a decent trade in value. I couldn't be happier. The finish on this car is smoother than a baby's butt!,,,Well close anyway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2007 Honda Accord has some new standard perks including side heated mirrors, side curtain airbags and a redesigned rear end which adds to it's sporty look better than my 2004's. It continues to drive great; hugs the road, great pick-up and the safe feeling you get when you're inside one. The reason I purchased a new Accord was that mine was totaled in an accident after a front end collision. Everything worked as it should, all air bags went off, and my son and I walked away with bruises only. I didn't have to think twice about the next car to buy - it kept me safe and I was getting another Accord. Plus, they're fun to drive and I feel great being behind the wheel. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Tested several cars but always went back to the Honda. Have only had it a few days, but it seems to be a winner. Leather, heated seats, auto a/c, heated mirrors, power seats, ect. The 2.4 has really good power, and mileage is 34/24. After inspecting the car at home, I was amazed at the fit, trim and paint, just perfect. Interior is very well designed with audio and cruise on steering wheel. Warranty was good but I selected the 7 year, 100,000 mile extended warranty/no deductible for only 817.00. The ride is smooth with the new Michelin Energy tires, with a 440 treadwear rating, A on traction and A on heat. The car is just a fantastic piece of work. Leg room in back is great. Buy it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second review. I now have 31k miles on my Accord. This has been an outstanding value for me. I do about 20K business miles per year in the Accord. If I am not in a rush, I try to cruise at 65 MPH on the highway and when I do, I get about 32 mpg. The car has been totally without problems so far. All I've done for maintenance is oil changes. Third gear is a minor irritation, as it will pop out of gear when the car is cold and I'm not careful with the shift action. The engine is a work of art, with a high redline and plenty of torque! I added an iPod connection and fog lights to the original package. TL sway bars and auto dimming mirror are next. Great car! </TEXT>

I find it very comfortable but I do very little long distance driving as some of the other reviewers. The tires are a bit noisy but I think that is a Michelin problem.

<TEXT>As a family sedan, the Honda Accord is legendary - it's reliable, practical, powerful. It has outstanding engineering and ergonomics, and everything is just exactly where it should be. The coupe puts it all in a sleek, sexy package that gives up very little in the compromise - in other words, it's still got a usable back seat and a real trunk, unlike most sport coupes. Honda also builds some of the best and smoothest engines and manual transmissions out there, something that goes very under appreciated, mostly because of the Accord sedan's family image. And the navi is intuitive and easy to use. Oh, and the gas mileage is great, especially for a V6.</TEXT>

She took the car on a 5 hour road trip and when she returned she complained that the seats are uncomfortable. I had to laugh because she is 5'7 115 lbs. My lease is up in a couple months.

<TEXT>It's been a great car so far. I check my mpg at every fuel-up and always get 25-point-something (my driving habits are about 50/50; city/hwy). The remote all-windows-down feature is neat but I don't use it. It's a very smooth ride with plenty of style. No major complaints. Though for the money, the minor complaints shouldn't exist. If Honda built the body and interior with the same quality as the engine, they'd have a perfect car. Do I have to spend $10k more and opt for the Acura? </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Large radio controls, front-and-center with the less-used temp controls below. Large display (speedo, tach, etc.). LED tail lamps. The interior is bigger and cleaner than an Altima without being boring like a Camry. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in my truck in order to get better gas mileage. I have not been disappointed at all. I average 27 mpg for city and 31 mpg on the highway. And believe me that I am hard on vehicles, taking corners at higher speeds than one should, speeding, etc. This car has been nothing but impressive from my standpoint. I have had no issues with it and it has over 24,000 miles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle because all the reports said Honda and Toyota have the best crash rating and best gas mileage. I am very disappointed. I do all city driving and I'm getting between 17 and 19 in the city. The service dept. ran a test for me but, their road test was a combo of city and highway. The test gave me a rating of 20.5. All the reports said I would get 21-23 in the city and 31 on the highway. I got better gas mileage on my 6 cylinder Nissan. In addition to the gas problem the car tires are louder than usual. I had it checked out and apparently that's just how they are. I am an unhappy consumer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car exactly a year ago, so it's a time to write a review. This is an excellent car for this price. There is no one feature from VP-to-LX differences I really miss. I believe it was a mistake for Honda to drop a budget style for the new Accord lineup. Hope they will have one for 2010. BTH, we have also 2007 V6 in the household - don't buy V6, the relatively small difference in acceleration doesn't worth paying extra money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought Honda after having small intermittent problems with our Saab 9- 5. Oh boy we were wrong about this "value" jump! I just trusted to BS reviews of majority of people who drove Fords and GM in the past. Although some can say Saab is another GM product, it was quite impressive for something based on Opel chassis. Anyhow, here is a short list of Honda quality problems: 1) Rattle in both front door attributable to TSB in Feb 2008 Service News Article, 2) Shaking, scraping and pulsating front brakes (fixed under warranty - warped front rotors), 3) Tires out balance (fixed under warranty), flat-spotting is something I will have to live with on this car, 4) Scratched cheap plastic panels.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded our 06 MB C-230 for the 2007 EX-L V6 and couldn't be happier. The MB was in the shop almost every other month. The Accord has been absolutely maintenance free, other than oil changes. The performance is terrific, and I much prefer the styling of this one to the new 08's - like most everyone else too! The only issue we've noticed is when the transmission downshifts during normal braking (@ around 30 mi/hr) it causes the car to lurch (it feels like the driver tapped the brakes hard) for a brief sec. If this is the worse that we experience, we're extremely happy. I previously had a 2003 EX-L V6 and the leather began to deteriorate after only 1 yr, hopefully this will hold up better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car for those on a budget. I have the V6 Special Edition, nice big 17" wheels, steering wheel controls and 6 disc Cd player. Ride is slightly firm because of bigger wheels, but trade off is excellent steering feel, superlative road feedback and above average acceleration. If you're like me and love to drive, then no other car in this segment fits the bill. Nothing could touch it for finish, reliability, sporty nature and good looks. The Camry doesn't look this good and definitely isn't sporty in driving dynamics. This car loves the backroads and twisties and the brakes are excellent. I don't agree with Edmund's rating for the brakes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks (17" wheels, with mudguards and a trunk spoiler), reliability, interior dashboard layout, steering wheel mounted radio controls.

<TEXT>This is my first Honda ever.. I just got a certified used Accord 07 after trading in my Dodge Intrepid. The best part I love about this car is the fuel economy. I just got an average of 27 mpg on my first tank with about 30% highway -70% city. I think that's awesome!! The Leather Seats are comfortable and I kinda like the factory installed stereo too! MMS also works great and shows the life of your engine oil so one less thing to worry. Love the LED tail lights. Actually if you think about it 06-07 models are unique relative to other accords since there will be only two years of such cars on road unlike the other models.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my 2007 Accord for almost 10 months now and have 23,000 Miles on it. I love the car, but it leaves more power to be desired in the low rpm. My g/f's 08 Civic seems more peppy and feels quicker in the low ranges. I do not abuse my car and have had all services done by a certified Honda dealer. Recently, I have had trouble with the brakes "Clunking" when applied at low speeds. I also hear a clunk sometimes when making low speed turns, but not in curves. Overall, I am very happy with the car. I average 34 mpg (more than double my truck.) This is a highway car even though most people will probably use it as a city car. If I had more city driving to do, I would buy the Civic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the last Honda I will buy, owned a 2003 and traded it in hoping I would get better gas mileage. Well since I have owned it I have never gotten more than 20 miles to gallon in local traffic, which is where most of my driving is. On longer trips, yes I do get 30 mpg. but since most of my driving is local it is costing me a fortune in gas for a 4 cyl. car. it said 24 to 32 mpg. Never go by that sticker on the side of the window. the inside is exactly the same as my 2003 accord they had 4 yrs. and changed nothing to the interior.

<TEXT>I purchased my Accord after discovering that my Acura CL had manufacturing defects in the paint and transmission, (I loved it & the Acura line until then!!). Despite the unforeseen problems w/the Acura I loved its speed, agility and Bose Stereo. So, I got the Accord because it was affordable and practical, and did not expect to love it. But..the V6 is quick, agile, (not as much as the acura). I get tons of compliments on the smooth, quiet ride, more of a sporty,roomy sedan. The look is not especially sporty, but not boring. The brakes are overly sensitive/grabby, and there are some blind spots at the pillars and front end. Overall pleased & pleasantly surprised.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall i love the car! It has great pickup and a smooth ride. A few things I've noticed. The AC pulls on the engine a little and you can actually tell a difference in performance with the AC on verses off. I notice it more when going from a complete stop to start or basically going from traffic light to traffic light. Sometimes you can feel it jumping a little when it's changing gears. It's funny because i have friends with an 06 and 05 model and they all say theirs performs in similar ways. So maybe its just a Honda thing. Its my first front wheel drive vehicle. Love how the car feels and I've gotten lots of compliments on it. </TEXT>

This is in spite if the fact I have teh EX-L with all power seat adjustments. Additionally, for the second time in 1 year my brakes rotors had to be turned and new brake pads installed.

<TEXT>This is a follow up after one year of ownership. The strengths of the car are gas mileage (WOW - better than any econobox) build quality, low ownership costs. The fun to drive factor is not there - I miss my Mazda 6. One discovery is that even though I have a fully power seat with adjustable lumbar, the leather drivers seat is hard on the seat bottom and the seat back has no upper back support. This seat feels good for the first 10 minutes and then it becomes the most uncomfortable seat I have ever endured in any car or truck, including an old vinyl bench seat. Also, I have had continual problems with brake pulsation due to rotor warpage or pad deposits.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th Accord, my first was a 1983 model. This is definitely not the nimble Accord that I remember. The Accord has grown to from a compact to a midsize. The Accord suffers from the "bigger is better" American car syndrome. Older Accords were definitely economy cars, not bloated family sedans. The 07 model suffers from some surprising (for Honda) design flaws. The rear doors are oddly designed, forcing you to move far away when opening the door. The trunk is large but difficult to access, with a small opening. And no outside temperature gauge or fuel economy monitor, standard on most VWs. If you're looking for a fuel- saving efficient small car, the Accord's not for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Long time Honda driver. Owned this car since 08/2007, loved it then, love it now. Read some reviews complaining of a pull to the right and I had the same problem. I was patient and it eventually resolved itself at 6000 miles. Considering the decent power, even at highway speeds, I get decent mileage. 24 mpg city, 32 mpg highway. A/c always on, and spirited acceleration while not over-speeding. Did a little experiment and drove over 450 miles @ 70 mph on one tank till it stopped dead on the road (had fuel in trunk-just me letting my inner boy play). Lumbar support is good, seats are comfy while supportive. Audio system isn't Bose, but still very crisp. Had zero problems with the car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've driven a Camry before, but I liked the body style of the Accord better this time around, so I researched and realized that they're pretty similar under the hood. I've had this car for almost a year and have not had any type of mechanical problem with it. It's pretty quick and fun to drive and the sound system is really good. The only issue I've had is with the passenger side window. When I'm on the highway, the wind noise is a little louder in this window than any other.

<TEXT>Traded in my '95 Accord EX w/ 218k miles for another Accord. Why? I drive 100 miles daily and need safe and reliable transportation. I figure I'll drive 25k miles annually. Looked at VW and Toyota but found Toyota bland and was scared off by the ever present electrical issues found with VW (as with most German made cars - go figure!). I can confidently drive my Honda knowing I've bought a solid, safe and reliable vehicle. It's not a sexy pick, but you don't buy an Accord for sexiness and sporting appeal rather you buy it for its solid reliability and resale value. Have 15k miles on it and so far no problems. All this car needs is regular maintenance and you're good to go!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great list of safety features (side curtain air bags, Stability Control, solid crash ratings); responsive V-6 w/ comparable gas mileage to 4 cylinder. Currently get 25 MPG w/ a/c; 28 MPG w/o on 90% highway driving. Exterior styling is great and I love the red color they have.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall the car has been mechanically reliable and runs great but with only 7000 miles it's not saying much. The body integrity is horrible. The driver's door flexes, creaks and rattles in a way that's unacceptable for a $20,000 new car. I've been to the dealer 3 times to fix it to no avail. However, if the window's cracked open slightly the rattle almost disapears.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my fouth Honda product, but my first new Honda purchase. Six months and almost 12k miles in the buy, I still love to drive the car. There's no hint of interior or exterior fatigue, much less any sign of mechanical problems. Everything is precise and predictable from starting in the morning to the seams that run between every panel on the vehicle. The SE V6 is nothing but fun to drive. There's plenty of torque and HP from the 6 shooter. This car has made Honda Motor Company very proud.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the way Honda packaged this version of the SE; it's not just another EX with a different badge. It comes standard with all the safety features, 6 disc changer, brake assist, VSA, 17 in wheels, and no options. It's truly a Special Edition. I especially like the acceleration, handling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>bottomlin: 2007 Honda Accord EX-L disappoints. Compared to the competition, it hold its ground but compared to previous Accords, it fails misebrably. i have owned a 2002 Honda Accord and a 2006 Toyota Camry in addtion to this 2007 Honda Accord EX-L. Things I don't like: The interior material is cheap and subpar. the 2002 accord has superior interior craftsmanship. 2007 accord has black leather interior. the leather is of the cheapest quality. it emits a fould odor like bad body odour.the pillar and roof are light grey while the rest of the car is black. it is supposed to be black uniformly but the dashboard is dark black plastic while the vinyl dashboard is grey. no black uniformity.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the third Honda Accord that I have owned. Great cars lots of nice features for the money. My wife puts on 25000 miles a year. My first car was a 1979, 2004, 2007. Our 2004 had 77000 miles on it when we bought the 2007. Oil changes tire rotation and some time keeping the car clean so when we drove it we could enjoy it. In a nutshell, these are great cars.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car has been flawless in the 11 months I've had it. It accelerates very well and handles great. I enjoy leaving other cars in the dust with my family sedan. The other drivers always seem surprised for some reason. So far all the car has needed has been an oil change and tire rotation.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car 7 months ago and now I have about 6500 miles on it. I travel mostly around town with the AC on. This is a reliable, well built, and comfortable car. I'm glad I bought this model with the 6 cyl as it has good acceleration and a very quiet engine, plus the SE model no longer is available in the V-6. I don't need a sunroof or auto climate control and it is not any big deal to have manual seats. Now the V6 is std. with all that and it jacks the price up close to an extra $3,000. But is does have stablility control, traction control and the luxury of the V6, which I really like. Really, this is a great used car buy too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2007 honda accord lx 4 door 2.4 manual transmission in september 2007. Thank you honda for doing a body change in the 2007.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>To start it's a sharp looking sedan, I chose the charcoal color and highly reccomend it. This car also has plenty of room for full size adults. The fact it has 6 airbags didn't hurt either, quite a safe car for the money. And I average 30 mpg all around.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We shopped around for different sedans and it came down to the honda accord and toyota camry. In the end, we liked the feel of driving the accord. The driving was more responsive than the camry. We got the honda accord fully loaded V6, it's very nice... drives great so far!! I'm a first time honda owner, and loving it!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned 5 different Honda Accord models. The 2007 EXL-V6 is a big disappointment. I have experienced an unusual vibration that shakes the steering wheel, dash, and mirrors whenever the car sits (parked) for periods longer than 8 hours. The dealership states its caused by the tires "flat spotting". Michelin somewhat agrees, and were good enough to swap out the OEM tires with another model of Michelin Pilot tires, and they also vibrate. So I had them install Yokohama Avid V4s and guess what--they also do the same thing! I called Honda Corporate and they claim this is how the Accord was engineered to ride, and that I should get used to it...needless to say, I'll be trading very soon!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car is more comfortable (interior) than the 06 Camry I traded for. The powertrain is also smoother than the Camry was, but the V-6 SE Camry did ride smoother than the Accord (even without the vibration). The mileage is about average at 24 MPG combined driving. I like the redesigned rearend. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded a Focus SVT for my 6-speed sedan. I wanted something with more room and refinement. I am extremely pleased with the Accord. The 6-speed is very smooth shifting; the engine is powerful and smooth. I recently sold my G35 coupe, which sounded like a tractor engine at WOT compared to the Accord V06! I like the stealth(sleeper)appearance of the sedan. The body leans more than I like in curves. I plan on adding some TL sway bars in the future. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Honda Accord a month ago. I am not very happy with the acceleration I get. I believe the VTEC engine takes time to respond especially at the lower gears. I drove my car for the first month only in city (several lights& traffic) and got very bad mileage of 18-19 compared to the advertised 24 mpg. Have been driving without hard braking and use of much air conditioning or heat. I was expecting atleast 21-22. Very disappointed! Not sure if I was handed the last bad piece they had.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have 1300 miles on the car and I am impressed with the ride. The drive train tends to whine when put under pressure, but the engine is top of its class. I am not sure why you would buy the 6-cyl when the i4 is so peppy and quiet at hwy speeds. I get 26 mpg around town with the manual. I think this is the best buy hands down. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Roomy and stylish interior with simple controls, tight build quality, smooth ride, refined drive trains, excellent crash test scores, Honda's strong reputation for reliability, high resale value and no sales tax for my hybrid in CT. The car rides like a $40,000 car, I love it! Feels and drives like a much more expensive car than the Toyota Camry. Way more engine horsepower & torque than the wimpish I4 Camry but not quite as thrifty on the gas. The V6 performance and higher quality road manners is worth it over the Camry plus mid 30's MPG- Very happy!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V6 performance with very good MPG. You wouldn't know it's a hybrid. Heated leather seats, quality feel of the ride, moonroof, no sales tax for hybrid.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I will own this car for a long time. I like to drive and this car is a great balance of performance and economy. I purchased a new Accord in 1990 and it has 160,000 miles and it has had no issues. I intend to keep this one even longer. It is nice to get a good quality car without having to pay for countless fancy options.</TEXT>
