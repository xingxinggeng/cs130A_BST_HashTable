<TEXT>I love this car it is wonderful. Stylish, fast, and just great. The only problem is they don't tell you how fast it depreciates. I bought it new and it's not worth a quarter of what I am still paying. So I do recommend buying a used or older year.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The negatives on this vehicle are interior space. Hardly any back seat. Not good for extremely tall people. I am 6'4" and fit very snugly. Worst is severe blind spots. Very low to the ground. Handles very well. Average fuel economy for 4 cyl. Decent acceleration/power. Always been reliable. Speaker in trunk eliminates some storage space.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior design of vehicle is first rate! Very sleek looking interior. Great sound system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 2007 eclipse has 2 problems: some of the models sunroofs do not open all the way (mine does not) and my air conditioner has not worked properly and the dealership does not resolve my issue, only makes excuses. I will not buy another Mitsubishi; their engineers do a poor job in my opinion and that of the service rep I spoke with. BEWARE! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 07 Spyder GT for this black 07 GT coupe back in April and have no regrets. I have the sun & sound pkg so I still have some open air. The hatchback has come in handy with our recent move, you can fit a lot in there. Love the exhaust note, comfort & all the looks I get. I have averaged 23 MPG for city driving which is the same as my wife's 04 Spyder so no complaints there. I don't "get on it" much because then you will see the needle fall. I find it funny that the critics hate this car and all of the consumers love it. I'll believe an actual owner over a magazine any day. I expect it will do well in our Ohio snow as did my spyder. Great car and highly recommend!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Best Sports/Touring Coupe 4 the $. Not a Performance Car, but it does have decent performance/economy for a 4 cyl 162 HP Engine & the 5speed transmission is smooth. Average 25 city & highest MPG was 34 Hwy w/o using A/C. I usually trade once a year, but I'm keeping this one. It has a few limitations, but for your $ investment, you can't go wrong if you are looking for a great touring coupe with a super warranty & features. I've owned a Honda Si, Nissan's, Toyota's, Corvettes, and for the money spent, this is the one I enjoy the most. Test drive one, & you will want one also. Enjoy your highways of life more, in an Eclipse. : ) You get more then you pay for in a Eclipse.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is just awesome. So much fun to drive. Dash lights are beautiful at night. I don't check my gas mileage cause the car is made to drive fast. I make road trips often and the car is very comfortable. Sound system is excellent. Love the rear fold down seats. Two sets of golf clubs and luggage will fit great. I had a wind deflector installed on the sunrooof and the wind noise with the roof open is gone. I have the orange one and it is such a head turner. When driving alone, I recline the rear of the passenger seat and it helps with the blind spot. This allows for a better view out of the smaller side rear window. I suggest you buy one today. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the car back in November. Traded in a 07 Mustang for it and I'm glad I did. The car is pretty peppy for an inline 4 and gets great gas mileage (I usually averaged about 30 mpg). It has a cool design and interesting interior. It's also pretty comfortable as well. I did, however, wreck mine about 3 weeks ago and totaled it. It held up very well but the airbags didn't deploy, strangely enough. Overall, I liked the car and would recommend it for someone who is looking for an affordable, sporty car that gets good gas mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is amazing. I owned a Cadillac before, and thought I would be disappointed, but its a lot of fun and drives great. I have been rearended by a heavy duty truck, and hit a deer at 50 mph - not a single scratch on the car. It's very reliable and takes a lot of abuse. It's the best car I have ever owned. I would highly suggest it to anyone. It's definitely a headturner, and unique, which were big pluses for me. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior. The design, I feel, helps to take turns really fast. The racer seats are very comfortable for long trips (which I take often).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a Dodge Dakota because I wanted a sportier vehicle. I did my research and after comparing the Mustang, RX-8, Civic-Si, and Eclipse, it was my favorite. I have had it about a month now and it is the best car I have ever owned. It's flashy, fast, hauls my golf clubs, and makes mundane trips to work a lot more exciting. It is an excellent medium between a full on performance car and a livable, daily commuting or touring car. The stereo is ridiculous. I didn't know you could get a stereo that sounds that good from the factory!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powerful V-6 engine, Rockford-Fosgate stereo, sunroof, sweet exhaust note, baseball stitched gearshift, and the backseat. That was the deal maker for me over a two seat coupe, as I have twin 3 yr. olds that ride with me.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought mine used with 17,000 miles on it. I was just looking for an everyday runner, and this car was available. Simply unbelievable. I never even looked at Mitsubishi before, but it's true that they've thought of everything. I have the convertible GT V6, and this baby is a runner, alright. Previous owner put a carbon fiber hood on her, 20-inch black spoke wheels, an air induction system to increase her horsepower, and all the options! Wow. She's amazing! The ride is incredible, the look is amazing, and the officer who pulled up alongside of me to tell me I was going too fast even gave me a thumbs up and a wave! And my golf clubs fit in the trunk! You won't be disappointed!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stereo is unbelievable, power is amazing, ride is superb, top is one-button operation which is done in 19 seconds, and is completely hidden under a power tonneau top. Ice Blue gauge lighting, heated front seats, automatic climate control, traction control, MIVEC V6 power, 6-speed manual transmission.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I looked for a very long time to get this car. I bought it with the Rockford stereo, which was a must, and complete with all the options. I was reluctant at first to buy any car with a 4 cylinder, but was very satisfied after driving mine. It did not take long to figure out that it has an amazing ride, as well as, all the power and handling anyone could ask for. This will not be my last Mitsubishi I promise you that.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the ride as well as the complete riding experience. I also love the Rockford sound system, which anyone should request when purchasing one of these vehicles. and do not be afraid of the small engine, it is plenty</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this car brand new off the lot in 2006. I have been driving it for two years now and would not give it up for the world. I love the comfort, sportiness, and sexiness it gives me on the road. The power is excellent for a four cylinder, although I do notice a sluggish start when running the A/C on high from a dead stop. Long distance drives have not left me with the "numb butt" feeling. That was a plus. I average about 28-30 mpg in town, if driving casually. If I romp on it, I can almost see my gas gauge move! Driver tendencies depend on gas mileage. I love the interior, although the driver side door could have an elbow rest a little higher. Absolutely great car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior lights, exterior looks, sound system, and fold down seats are great. Pretty comfy to sleep on if you must, and I have twice. Steering wheel buttons are great for quick access.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall the car is gorgeous and reliable. It's heavy and built solid like a tank, which makes me feel safe. The sound system is FANTASTIC! It's fun to drive and I always get lots of looks when I'm out and about in it. Luckily, I'm short so the car offers me lots of room. I hauled a 32 inch 100 lb tv in the trunk 220 miles to my brothers and had room left over for my luggage and dvd player. It's all in how you pack your cargo. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased as a first car for my daughter but I'm driving it more than she. Every time I drive it I'm more impressed. Today I drove a combination of interstate and U.S. Rt 1 from Richmond, VA to D.C. in heavy downpours and lots of standing water with my wife and daughter onboard and felt in control at all times. Always looking for an excuse to drive. Peppy, sporty ride and handling, great braking, tight steering, just overall fun to drive. Lots of compliments on styling with the sunset color. Weird because I was looking for BMWs when my daughter talked me into driving it. The price was $500 more than Kelley Blue Book TRADE IN with the balance of a 6 year, 60,000 mile warranty.</TEXT>

I currently own a 2000 Pontiac Grand Am and have always loved the sportier cars and have to say the Eclipse is pretty amazing. The get up and go is awesome, def. more torque than my grand am and the sound system is pretty awesome too. I'm getting the green/silver/blue color and think it's a very classy choice. </TEXT>

<TEXT>From the day I bought the car, I just liked it, not loved it. I didn't buy it for the gas mileage, so I wasn't expecting good mileage. The power was fun (manual makes it better), but I notice all the other things like the blind spot, rough ride and road noise. To top it off, when I took the car in for a shimmy while braking, I was told that it is normal for the rotors to have to be resurfaced every 10,000 miles. So have fun with the car, just don't use the brakes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car used with only 15,000 miles on it. Used to be a rental. I absolutely love the body. The interior is great, mostly at night with the blue interior lights. The car draws lots of attention, thank God this comes standard with security. Surprised to find such power in a 4 cylinder. I test drove a 6 cylinder, the extra pick up was better but not enough to make me want it. The 6 also requires premium gas and when purchasing this, gas was definitely an issue. The gas mileage is okay if you're not running and gunning. I love the way the engine sounds and the handling is pretty good. I like the fact that there is more room than in the older models.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Speed, sexy looks inside and out with chrome lined gauges and blue display lights. Nice cd player. good sized trunk with fold down back seats. Great pick up for a 4 cylinder(don't listen to the editor reviews this thing can go for what sized motor it has). The many airbags, and safety features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my commuter mobile. It has plenty of power and torque despite it's a 4 cylinder engine. Plenty of interior room for front seats but the rear seats are not for people - just extra storage space. You get a lot of car for its price - style and performance compared to its competitors.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th eclipse, Mitsubishi knows what they are doing. They make the vast improvements with the vehicle years. This model pretty much takes the best of every body style and puts it into a powerful, reliable, well controlled, tank. This car is for the price the best buy for the buck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. It's not as sporty as G1/G2 Eclipses, though it traded some of its sportiness to a true everyday comfort and that was a square deal. It's still fun to drive either it's mountain Colorado roads, everyday commute or 2000 miles vacation trip to Yellowstone. Ride is smooth but you have all the control through the corners you can expect from a n Eclipse. V6 gives more than enough power for civic roads, thanks Mitsubishi for standard stability control! In its price range Eclipse GT has no close competitors, you'll get most for your money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For the price I paid for this car I think it was the best on the market. As far as toys and looks go it is a very very good car. If you are not planning to race around professionally, the performance is good enough for you and the stereo system, design, etc., makes the car look more expensive than it actually is.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Eclipse and I love it. I get so many comments from so many people and it feels good. I wish the car was lighter and had dual overhead cams instead of a single because I'm 24 and I like to have a lot of power, but with modifications it could be a power house. Over all I love the car, the feel of it on the road, the inspirated racing seats, the blue gauges astound me every time. This is a very fun car to drive and fun to look at, its a real eye catcher.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Some people don't like this car because it's a V6 and front wheel drive, but it doesn't matter what they think when I'm passing Mustangs with their V8s. This car doesn't only look fast, it can back it up. If you don't regularly drive more than 1 person you should be fine, otherwise it might be an issue with the back legroom being absent. But the interior is great, displays all blue at night, has sunroof, 6 disc rockford phosgate system, displays the temp, cd track and time. I'm very pleased with this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first two seater I've ever owned. I had always driven sedans. This car is a good value. Its styling is to my taste and the interior design is well thought out. This car is enjoyable to drive although not a high performance sports car by any measure. I am getting 27 plus miles to the gallon with only 2,000 miles on car so far. I am still adapting to the driver's seat. It took me one month to find a comfortable driving position. Getting used to the passenger side blind spot is no big deal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 650 Watt stereo, blue gauge lighting, sunroof, body design, how the engine has surprising power and pickup when you get in the 4,000 rpm torque band, and the Gear box is smooth and positive. Its handling is OK without excessive body roll.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I don't understand the poor reviews of this vehicle by the so-called experts. I drove several cars (Mustangs (2), Miatas (2), Honda Civic Si, RX-8, Solstice, Corvettes (2)). While this car is no Corvette (frankly the Corvettes were too much car for me), it is a lot of fun to drive. In fact, given legal speed limits, I would say it allows one to jump on the gas and still remain at reasonable speeds, i.e., you can actually utilize what the car offers. And, I liked it much better than the Honda Civic Si - which all the "experts" rave about. If you're looking for a reasonably priced car, and don't plan on limiting your driving to pushing the car to the max on an oval, it's worth trying.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the design, inside and out. The quality appears very good in both and it has some character, unlike the Honda Civic Si which I found to be painfully plain on both counts. I also love the intuitive and easy to use controls. The blue interior lighting is also very sharp.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my third Eclipse and its flair seemed to fade less than two months after purchase. Its fuel economy rating is not even close to its EPA estimates though. I enjoyed my 1994 and 2002 models much more and am look to trade this gas guzzler before the end of the year. The styling is truly unique, so unique that it will be out of style faster than ever. The special "aero" kit required three adjustments and because it is difficult to see the front and back end, scraping curbs are unavoidable. The steering and brakes are great, and so is the acceleration, but like an amusement park ride it is time to leave for something else.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2007 Eclipse is a dream car. It has the styling of a small speedster, the beauty of a classic sports hatchback, and the get up and go of a roadster. The 6-cyl. 14 valve, 260 HP engine, provide plenty of power to rock the road. Do not hestitate to take it for long drives. The car hugs the road. Its ride is very comfortable and there is plenty of room for luggage, the dog, the cooler and the golf clubs. Whether you go with the hard top with the sunroof, or the convertible Spyder, you cannot make a bad choice here. I was set on a two seat roadster so I drove the Solstice, the Sky, the RX-8, and the G6. The Eclipse won the day. There is no need to spend your life savings, you can have it all with the Eclipse. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the Sun and Sound package, the combination of small leather fold down back seats and a hatch back - a choice you cannot get with the Solstice, Sky, or the RX- 8, the feel - smooth ride, weight is a bonus not a handicap!

<TEXT>After testing driving the Scion tC, Honda Civic and the Ford Mustang V6 I test drove and purchased an Eclipse GS. While it is more expensive than the Scion and the Honda, I felt the Eclipse delivered more value. It has better acceleration than the Scion or Honda, has more comfortable seats, has a better interior layout, and a has much better exterior design. I did like the Mustang's exterior design, but it's interior seemed cheap and poorly laid out. Overall the Mustang (which was more expensive than the Eclipse) just didn't seem to offer as much value.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well I've had my '07 Eclipse GS for about three months now so I think I have a good enough feel for the pros and cons to rate this car and give it a review. First of all the car looks GREAT. The design on the exterior is so innovative and curvy. The interior is a beautiful blue color at night thanks to the little blue LED lights inside the dash. However, the plastic on the doors and other parts of the interior IS CHEAP. I barely knick the door and there's a scratch. I can't have anyone sit in the back if there wearing heels because I am afraid they might scratch the plastic. I really hate the fear of scratching my plastic every time I take a ride, but over all the car is nice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior design, the engine's torque, the tail lights, the blue LEDs on the dash, the windows that go up and down when you open and shut the door, and the key fob that has everything built in on the key.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I were searching for a sporty car that gets decent gas milage at an affordable price. The '07 Eclipse fits the bill very nicely. We love the "new" body styling. It had always been my dream to own a Porsche 911 someday. But let's face it, the average person will never be able to afford that. You can get a similar look for 1/4 of the price with the new Eclipse. The performance of the 4-cylinder engine is really suprising. It has plenty of power for the average driver. We took it for a 150 miles trip down the Blue Ridge Parkway this past weekend, and it ran and handled like a dream. I am 6' 3" and weigh 220 at 52 yrs old. I can get in and out of the car with no problems.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The body styling, price, and warranty. Its gas milage is pretty good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first new car purchase and so far I'm really loving this car. The exterior styling is gorgeous and the interior is in two words "simple elegance," not too overly done but eye catching none the less. The front seats are very comfy but the back seat is small with no leg room, but that doesn't bother me since I don't sit back there! :) It's got a peppy engine for a 4-cyl. but does get a little sluggish with the A/C on in my opinion. It takes turns like nothing and the the brakes are also wonderful, It it the best vehicle I've ever experienced. The Rockford Fosgate sterio is killer, a MUST have. All around I adore this car and it's a huge step up from my '01 Grand Am. Buy one, youu'll love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior styling, sound system, awesome brakes, sunroof, pretty much EVERYTHING! This car is very fun to drive. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>On a long trip or short hop the 2007 Eclipse is just pure fun. I lose few stereo wars with its Fosgate 650W stereo and no off the line acceleration. It is almost on par with the 2006 Mustang GT, which is faster than their previous GT. I also looked at the Nissan 300Z and Mazda RX-8. They are overpriced for what you get. The 2006 'Stang GT is also overpriced when you compare it to the Eclipse's features side by side and plus everyone has one. This car is also a real "head turner." ' I have been on eleven hour straight drives up steep mountain passes and flat praries, the car is just a pleasure to be in and has amazing power when you need it to pass. It is worry free. I also garden and can haul a couple of 1.7 cu ft dirt bags and many plants in one go. What a great Car! Also, it eats BMW 3-Series off the line easily.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The styling, power, stereo, fuel economy, cargo space, and smooth manual shift box.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Driving this car is very fun and pleasurable. The '07 Eclipse is a great head turner. Its styling is awesome. Road trips in it are comfortable and its performance is A-OK even with the 4-cyl. engine and the A/C on. Overall the car is top notch. We are very happy owners of this vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The awesome Rockford Fosgate sound system and the manual gate shift option on automatics.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I Traded an '01 for the '07 Eclipse. I loved my '01 model, but had to trade it in. My new car handles easily and is very sleek. The '07 Eclipse is not just for the young, but for anyone. I am 61 years old I know I will love my new car as much as my old one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior lights on the dashboard, the ease of changing the audio controls, and the windows that go down slightly when you open the door and close when you shut the door. I love the dome light my old car didn't have one. The rear hatch doesn't seem as heavy as my old one. I love the shape of the car</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the Eclipse GS model last week and it is a fun to drive car. Its Sportronic transmission it makes you feel in control of the car. Its acceleration is good for a 4-cylinder and it is a good looking car inside and out. The road handling is very good and makes tring to get more out of the car. So far, it is a very good choice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like how this car is fun to drive, has a great interior and exterior apperance. and has a good sound system with the 10 inch sub.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My Blue Eclipse GS model is not bad for those looking to drive and have fun at the same time. It is really nice around the corners and it has a smooth ride. It gets people's attention when crusing the streets. Also, the guages are really nice to look at when checking your speed. The seats are comfy, too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The blue lighting of the guages and the comfortable seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my car! This is my second Eclipse, I traded my '03 model for the '07 and I have no regrets. I am always getting compliments on my car. If you don't want to be noticed this is not the car for you. I can't even pump gas into my car without someone coming up to talk to me about it. If you are looking for a family car this is also not the car for you. The backseat serves no purpose other than to put a purse on it when I have a passenger but then again I bought the car for me and being 18 backseats aren't important to me. Foglights are also a must because it makes the car look better and not so cheap with the black plastic inserts.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sun and sound package is a must! The audio controls on the steering wheel are awesome. I love the ice blue and green color combination.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just traded my low mileage 2004 Spyder in on the new one - I now have the Sunset Pearlescence colored GT with the Sportstronic transmission (which lets you drive as an automatic AND/OR a five speed manual transmission). Initially I was worried about the trade as I was crazy about my 2004 Spyder. But after having the 2007 for a few days, all my concerns have been eased. The 2007 handles better, rides better, looks more like a luxury car and turns heads more than the previous style. I think I'm going to be a happy camper-so far so good!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 650 watt 9 speaker stereo system blows away the previous cheap Infinity stereo. Of course, the self-hiding soft top is way cool, as are the blue LED dashboard lights. The seats provide ultimate comfort and the all new Spyder style turns out to be something I'm beginning to love...</FAVORITE>
