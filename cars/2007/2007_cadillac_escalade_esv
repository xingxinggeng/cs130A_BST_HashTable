<TEXT>Enjoyed the dealer experience. But when you have a pile of crap like the ESV to sell, they wont be in business long. Had in shop more than we have driven her. The rear windshield washer wiper now wont work. Horrible gas mileage and the auto transmission shifts into higher gear too guickly. If you have to buy this sized SUV, get a used Sub or Yuk. Wouldnt own another, trust me.!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>What do you buy used for $50K? Answer a low mileage, late model Denali for $30K and save the $20K. The dealership experience was top of the line. But we are having the black paint redone, interior detailed and some work completed under warranty. We have had the unit for 4 weeks and driven her 5 times. We are so spoiled by having 20 yrs of experience with Lexus, decided to try the ESV since it really looks so wonderful. Get past the looks, this isn't worth the 70K new and questionable if worth the $42K we spent. If I ever decide to be more positive about this experience, I will write you an update.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I will start by saying I love the look of this SUV. It looks sharp coming down the road. Beautiful design. But we have had nothing but trouble with this vehicle. It has been in the shop more than I can count. I usually wait until 3-4 things are wrong before I put it in the shop now. The wind noise is unbelievable. It is extremely loud on the highway on a windy day. If you are wanting a quiet vehicle, this is not it. We have never paid this much for a vehicle and have been nothing but disappointed. Seems like the designers could have worked out all of the wind noise before they produced the car. We are trading it in very soon and hoping for a quieter vehicle with less trouble.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Beautiful, stylish design. Fun to drive. Like the blue lights. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm only 5 feet tall and was scared to purchase this car. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! It handles beautifully and I have no problems at all with it. It is so beautiful inside. My boys love the DVD system. It is the King of SUV's! I'm so happy we purchased this </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love that the seats can be programed so that when my hubby and I drive the car it automatically sets to the driver. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my first Escalade in April of 06. There have been so many problems and design flaws. First and foremost, why would you put the DVD player under the seat? You can't even stretch your legs without kicking it. The wireless headphones broke easily. The third row is pretty much for babies and toddlers only. The legroom is comical. Too much plastic too. Sometimes the DVD player won't turn off too. No fold flat seats or MP3 jack and the second row seats are really loud when you let them down. On the bright side, the performance is outstanding, the interior quality is great, and I love all of the features.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DVD player, heated seats, remote start, sunroof, perforated leather, auto liftgate, blue gauge needles, rotating sideview mirrors, back-up sensors, folding second-row seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought the 2007 Escalade ESV as a step up from our Durango. We absolutely loved it. Starting the next day after signing, the problems started. Keyless remote start wouldn't work, then the heated seats quit, not once but 3 different times, the airconditioner wasn't working, the module for the tire pressure quit working, the heat in the back quit working and more. We have now owned this thing for 3 months and its been in the shop over 30 of those days on 9 different occassions. I would never ever buy another one!! 70K wasted....sigh</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated steering wheel. Actually all of them if they would work and keep working.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my 2007 ESV for almost a year and after spending almost $70,000 on it, I am extremely disapponted. For a company that brags about "the quietest ride ever", it is loudest vechicle I have ever been in. The wind noise is so bad that I am thinking of trading it in already. I have had it into the dealer 5 times with to no avail. It sounds like the windows are rolled down and the wind is blowing 90 mph. I wouldn't recommend that anyone buy this ESV until some MAJOR changes happen. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the look. Can't beat black</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Over all we love this vehicle, however we are very unhappy with the wind noise and have had it into the dealership 4 times to try and have it corrected. The dealership has done everything the manufacturer has recommended and there has not been much improvement it sounds like the windows are not all the way up and is very annoying as we did not plan on spending money and have this problem. Love the seats with the A/C as we live in Florida. Drives beautifully.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I enjoy every aspect of my big, bold and beautiful ESV! It is very comfortable for my legs at 6'6". I love the strong growl of the engine, it's like a muscle car on steroids. I guess it's an SUV with an asterisk. I was very careful before spending over $60K for a vehicle. I did the comparisons with all the other leading luxury SUVs - none compared in features and power (403 horsepower!) This SUV is the King! I bought this car becauase I liked everything about it. I never thought I would so many looks and compliments and 'thumbs ups' in traffic. This SUV turns heads! I have no idea how sane person could give this SUV a bad rating. Go drive it for yourself... </TEXT>

<TEXT>OK, well I am an avid Escalade cheerleader! I have owned one for seven years and decided to buy the 2007 model! Hmmmm, well the interior looks so huge because they took out the soft plush seats and replaced them with crappy flat uncomfortable seats! It drives like a bus parking it in a tight parking spot at the grocery store is scary to say the least! The bells and whistles are great, 22s, navigation, XM radio, two DVDs, but come on if the base package isn't right who cares about the bells and whistles! Come on the 2007 Escalade is not a true Cadillac! Save you money buy a 2003 - 2006 model of Escalade, I PROMISE you wont be disappointed!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After coming out of a '03 Navigator I believe Caddy stepped up to the plate. I test drove the '07 Naviagator and Expedition. The Escalade ESV is a superior vehicle. 103hp is considerable. The exterior styling is very well executed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It has a nice power band with plenty of reserve hp for passing for a vehicle of this size. Reverse camera and rear storage capacity. Nav radio sounds awesome. Rear entertainment system for passengers. Remote start is convenient.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had Chevy Trucks for years, but this thing is awesome! It has unreal braking capability for such a large vehicle and great accleration too! I love the styling and the interior is extremely comfortable and roomy (I am 6'9" with long legs). I can't say enough about it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Navigation, XM radio, cooled seats, heated washer fluid, and the auto up back door and dashboard. Also, if you have Verizon wireless you can get a shared phone number and use the phone feature with the OnStar, it sounds great and is easy to use. You can dial the number right from the screen!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This truck is truly amazing and rides and handles as though it is substantially smaller. The perfomrance is fantastic and the fit and finish are top notch. I have the White Diamond with the Ebony interior. When comparing this truck to the European and Asian large SUV's the ESV wins on space and comfort. Besides, the rumble of the V8 engine sounds like my '71 Vette. The NAV system and the entertainment system are great along with the rear camera. Air conditioned seats are a feature I thought I never needed and now wonder on those hot summer days how we did without. Its gas mileage isnt to bad for its size. Remember it weighs close to 3 tons so 14 mpg's ain't too shabby. I have gotten over 17 on the highway. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The drivetrain and all the comfort and convenience features are fantastic. The Intellibeam headlamp system is great on those dark roads switching your high beams on and off.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I went from a 2003 Ford Excursion to the best SUV on the planet. I love my Caddy from bumper to bumper. I have all the bells and whistles on my Escalade. Compared to all of the previous SUVs that I've owned none come close to the dynamic handling, superior interior, and powerful engine. The ESV is the SUV bar none!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an amazing SUV. They have improved the engine, it now has 403hp. It has a spacious trunk compared to the regular Escalade. It drives great, it's not that fun to drive around due to its size but it's really great on trips.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The escalade ESV is a great family SUV. One problem is that there aren't that many interior options. Also, the seats get dirty very easily. It takes regular unleaded fuel, so there are no worries about the high cost of Premium. My truck gets 12 mpg city, and 17 mpg highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had luxury cars and I've had SUV's. This one brings it all together in one package. It provides great styling and a great ride. Its interior is really classy. It has lots of luxury items throughout. The navigation system and back-up rear camera are both really top notch. Mine is black and came with 22 inch chrome wheels. I have never had a car that gets so many "looks" running down the street. I know part of that is because it is so new, (and, after all, it IS a Cadillac), but the bold front grille and clean lines with just the right amount of chrome, really grabs attention. The engine has lots of power and acceleration, not like a big vehicle, at all. I can't wait to get in it going to or coming home from work. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love it! I went from an '03 ESV to the '07 and what a difference! the new one has an awesome interior...it is very comfortable and everything is where it should be. It rides nice and appears to handle much better than the '03. A couple of additional items would have made this the perfect truck: Bluetooth, Auto-up windows, and better fuel economy...early indications are about 10 MPG city / 14 MPG Highway...a far cry from the 13 City / 19 Hwy that are found in other reviews.</TEXT>
