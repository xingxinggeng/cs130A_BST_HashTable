<TEXT>I have had my 300 for the past two years. Traded in my Chevy Tahoe for this car. So far my car has had both fuel tank problems. The parts were very hard to find, and Chrysler Inc did not want to take any responsibility. Chrysler personnel have very poor customer skills and a very poor customer service both at the dealer and at the manufacturer. Car has run out of gas several times with the fuel gauge showing over 1/4 of a tank. Dealer and Manufacturer have seen nothing wrong and released this car to me. I have ran out of gas in this vehicle at least 5 times, and sometimes on the freeway. The support for this car is horrible.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I couldn't have designed or built a better car if I did it myself. I usually buy a top of the line car with all the do-dads. Because of the economy, I thought I'd better scale down and buy something less expensive. I did, and man am I surprised! I thought I was skimping, but got one of the best cars I've ever owned. I honestly can't find ONE thing to complain about. It's quiet, roomy, comfortable, fast, exceptionally impressive and economical. You can take it to Home Depot, load the trunk with no problem. Take it to the country club later and park it with the big boys! .. all for the price of a Honda. I'm totally happy with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a 2000 300m new, and loved it for 6 years. Picked up the 2007 Touring (ex-Rental) for 14K at a local GM dealer, added chrome 18" 300c wheels and Goodyear Eagle Response Edge tires. What a difference! It now handles like my old 300m which had a 'performance/handling package'. Same 3.5L V6 moves it around pretty well, and gets 27 mpg highway. I drive windy mountain roads daily, and use the auto-stick to keep it in 3rd up to 45mph. On the hwy, it slips into 5th, and just flat cruises. RWD took some time to adjust to, but handles well. The stock stereo sounds almost as good as the old 300m. The aux jack connects to an MP3 player or ??. GSM replaces compass/computer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second 300C, after trading in a 2005 RWD. The first one was an early build, first model year and it had several small annoyances, some of which were fixed under warranty. The 2007 has been problem-free. AWD is great in a car like this, you can take off in any weather with no wheel hop; not that RWD was unusable in snow, but the OEM Continental tires that wore out in 10K miles were the real culprit. Your mileage may vary, but it can honestly get 25mpg with the car loaded and the A/C on in hilly terrain.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one of the most classically designed reasonably priced vehicles on the road today. Chrysler 300C needs about a 30% Improvement in interior & rear traction Imperfections to be the best model on the market, in its category. Most serious problem with Model 300C Non-Four Wheel Drive is a "Serious Lack of Rear Traction, in Snow".</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has been fantastic. Can't complain about anything. Even the gas mileage for a 425 hp car is above average. I can get 23 mpg on the freeway on long trips. I am 6'8'' and 300 lbs and this is the first car that I have owned that an adult can actually sit behind me while I am driving. If you are looking for a fun, fast, family car that competes with the Germans, take a look at this one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been looking for a great deal on the 300 since they came out. Got a smoking deal on a 2007 Dealer car: 6300 miles, 5 speed auto stick (unavailable on the newer 3.5 models), leather, sun roof. Traded in a 2004 Liberty due to the gas mileage. I have just got the 300 and I've averaged 25 MPG! Great for a large car. Golf clubs and three wheel cart fits easily in the trunk. The cruise control is in an odd spot, and the drivers window is the only one with one touch down (Liberty had both front windows one touch down). Ride is excellent, and I am looking forward to a long, happy, and satisfying relationship.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The only major complaint I would have with the Chrysler 300 is the "thunk" you feel when you slowly take off from a light and you hear a hard thunk (as though someone has hit you from the rear). The "thunk" sound also occurs when you are trying to reverse the vehicle. The Salesman along with Chrysler repair man says that Chrysler is aware of the "thunk" sound and that is has something to do with the "Tranny" and since the car has 3 computerized components, each components has different functions and they are playing catch up to each other when you hear that slight thunk. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love driving my 300C AWD. I traded in my 2006 Charger Daytona in Go- Mango. I loved that car, and what a head turner it was! I traded for a Jeep commander Limited, which I just could not get used to. I prefer a car and the Jeep was so big and was a real gas guzzler with the HEMI. I traded after 6 weeks for a Chrysler 300C AWD that is completely loaded, including Nav. and backseat DVD, which my 7 yr.old grandson loved on a recent 650 mile road trip. This is a remarkable vehicle. The 300C in infernal red is also a head turner, but more sedate than the Daytona. I think it is more comfortable than the Charger, and while not the R/T it still has lots of power, and that great HEMI sound.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is probably the finest car I've ever owned. I have owned Cadillac, big Buicks, several Pontiacs, and this one tops them all. I traded a Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab (HEMI) because of gas mileage, and I am very happy I did. The mileage has been averaging in the mid-20's with the 3.5 L HO engine on a 35 mile one-way daily commute. Plenty of power, and good mileage too. Best of both worlds. The car rides and handles great, a true road car, but nimble around town as well. Lots of room inside and creature comforts galore. I absolutely love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Absolutely love the car. You can't beat the value here. Where else, besides the other SRT8s, can you get a 425hp motor, race tuned suspension and Brembos for around $40k? Nowhere! Exterior styling isn't my favorite, but it gets tons of compliments. Interior is well laid out, other then the cruise control stalk, but material quality could be better. As far as performance goes, this car easily keeps up with the German performance sedans and annihilates the American and Japanese ones. That goes for acceleration, which goes without saying, but also handling, where the SRT8 puts up handling numbers, comparable to the M5, and that shame cars such as the E55 and STS-V. Very impressive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 6.1 liter HEMI, without a doubt. My car is a stripper, so I don't have any of the fancy add-ons, just the required go fast goodies.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've been admiring the 300C since its debut in 2005, and finally went out and bought one; a 2007 300C SRT Design model. The SRT Design shares some of the appearance cues of the SRT8, such as 20" wheels, trunk-mounted spoiler, suede seat inserts and leather-wrapped steering wheel, but has the smaller 5.7 liter hemi. My fuel economy fluctuates between 18 and 20 mpg with mixed highway/city driving, which is better than the V6-powered Isuzu SUV that this car replaced, so I have no complaints about the fuel consumption. The car is comfortable, quiet, stylish, fast, and is very well equipped, plus has a lifetime powertrain warranty; a lot of car for the money. I highly recommend this car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I rally like the SRT Design styling cues, the multi-displacement function of the 5.7 liter hemi (4 of 8 cylinders shut off during light load), and the Navigation system. Also, the telescopic steering wheels and pedals are nice - they really let you dial in the perfect comfort driving position.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 300 is a great car for me and I am very happy I decided on this over some others. I looked at foreign and domestic cars in this class but ultimately chose the 300, with the price the final decider. I am very satisfied with the 3.5 V6, and the mpg savings over the hemi makes it a worthwhile choice for me. It is very roomy and comfortable. Pleasure to drive, not a sports car but fun. Extremely quiet inside even at 85 mph. At first I was afraid the "chopped" look meant poor visibility but not the case. My former car was an Aurora and I miss its oomph but I don't miss the low mpg, high maintenance cost and amenities that were an annoyance at times. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>aux input on dash (for ipod, etc), wish the jack was inside the center console where there is a 12V socket as well. Big cargo area by folding down entire rear seat backs.

<TEXT>Coming out of a 00 Jag XJ8 brought a little concern w/No regrets. The interior room is much welcome (5 adults comfortably) along with nice size trunk. Fit & Finish is not the same. American manufactures do not understand that they need to offer less options. Offer 2 or 3 packages. The performance is better except for steering. Quiet & Comfortable ride + price= Five Stars.

<TEXT>Yes, after doing lots of seat time at the computer and stopping at all the local dealers in the Houston area to get information and a hands on experience of what is being offered to the motoring public I chose the Chrysler 300 Touring package above the GM, Ford and Japanese offerings. Chrysler, with the input of the Daimler group have seem to have struck an accord of styling, performance, and affordability that the competition could not match. Not only is the bold styling a hit, the exterior/interior color combinations available wonderful, the vehicles actually look good in the colors offered. Don't pass up the opportunity to compare and see the real value of the 300 marque. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the bold frontal look along with the stylish sculpted side view of the 300 Sedan. Ingress and egress of the car is excellent. I am further impressed with the performance of the 3.5l V-6 engine coupled to the 5 speed Auto-Stick transmission and the Electronic Stability package. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been driving a Lexus LS400 for 8 years. From the moment I sat behind the wheel of this vehicle and stepped on the accelerator I was hooked. On the highway the power and acceleration is awesome. The ride is as smooth and quiet as my Lexus. It even handles turns well. The dash is contemporary yet classic. I love the analog clock. My car came with Sirius for one year as an extra bonus. No nav or sunroof. I never used the sunroof on my Lex. Otherwise evrything else loaded (leather, heated seats, auto telescoping steering wheel, premium speakers. Just a great package. I also drove the V6 3.5. The road feel was similar. There is a big drop off in power and acceleration.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car was a gift & is a gift to anyone who owns one. It drives like no other car I've been in, I have fallen in love with this car. It's smooth almost gliding over the road and handles effortlessly. I find myself driving most every weekend and taking the backroads with the top down & listening to crystal crisp music surrounding me. Whoever's with me can't stop admiring "Ben", my 300C Hemi Convertible. However it doesn't stop there, I get stares, comments, questions or a smiling acknowledgement from people all the time. Strange at first, but nice and now it's a pleasant way to talk to people. PS I wished for a 4 door convertible for my anniversary</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the best company car I've ever had. I selected it because I had read that components like the transmission and suspension were sourced from the Mercedes 300. Whether this is true or not I can honestly say that the suspension is firm yet compliant like a Mercedes (I owned 260E in the late 80's) and the transmission has been flawless. The autostick is more fun then an regular automatic and the 250 HP six gets up and goes. Plenty of room inside - I'm 6'3 250lb - interior is stark but functional. Stereo is above average for out-of-the-box US car. Wish it had 18 or 19 inch wheels but I can live without them. I am pleasantly surprised with this car. Audi A8=10; this is a solid 8!</TEXT>

The fit and finish is as good as I've seen on any American-made car. This car is exceptionally designed inside and out and I'd challenge anyone to try it and tell me that it doesn't rival cars costing much more in both performance and appearance. The multi-displacement engine, so far, is getting better mileage than I expected. I previously owned a 2004 Concorde, which I liked, but this is a much higher level of luxury.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased the Chrysler 300C last week!I love it, it drives & rides incredibly smooth and quiet. The only noise I hear is a little wind when the sun roof is open, but it's totally worth it! I traded in a Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab and I am so pleased with this car, I can't say enough about it, the inside is very roomy & comfortable. My husband is 6'3" and approx 200 lbs and he is very comfortable in the car and not cramped at all! The programming features are fantastic, once you set everything up to your specifics it is all saved and linked to the remote for the car! The back seats pull down and open to the trunk, so you have lots of trunk room if you need it. The satellite radio is great</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a pretty solid car. You can tell once you slam the door and start it up. Very stable performer. Fuel economy about 18 MPG. This car has some ponies under the hood. This car was loaded with all available options. Handles great! Only one problem - had PO430 emission code pop up once at 1,100 miles. Checked pending codes and reset. Code has not returned. I suspect it is due to break in issues. This is a very fun car to drive, and very comfortable. The Nav system works great, and the upgraded stereo system is awesome. This was worth the 43K I paid for the car. I suggest if you buy this one, get all of the options including the Hemi. You will not be disappointed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Cupholder location is poorly designed, difficult to "learn" the switches. Auto lights should come on with wipers on intermittent not just full speed. My driver's side door will not stay open. Tired of getting beaten up every time I get in or out of vehicle. Comfort A++, eye catching A++++.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Mine's the Diesel but it's not available in the drop down. However, excellent bit of kit, dealer is also very good. Just bought it 2 months ago, got 36 MPG on a long run - never had a 3 liter car return this sort of consumption. Massive 'A; pillars take some getting used to as does the length. a rear view camera would be very useful as the parking sensors don't seem to take much notice of anything not dead in line. Nice to be back in a car that other drivers respect (i.e. they move over when you come up behind them). Power to spare, still 'running in' but will do a ton at less than 3000 revs (on a private track of course).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Road presence, comfort, handles very good for its size.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The bis 6 was great. Fine handling,very good power, but my wife wasn't impressed with the leather seats, and I wanted the walnut WOOD trim with sunroof. There was what we both wanted in C model (v8) in the lot. Superb power and only 1 mpg less than the 3.5 six, so we bought the C< with an excellent price. Huge A pillars detract from driver's vision, but plenty of leg and headroom, front AND REAR. Steering wheel controls are confusing and will take a lot of patience to memorize. Extra stalks around steering column are ridiculous as is power control for tilt/telescope feature.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE> Great handling and vast power, terrific interior layout. Rides like a limo.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>390 ft lbs of torque make this car fun to drive. Touch the gas pedal at any speed, and the hemi responds instantly, Love the low roofline and the grille... This car is a great value for the money and has features of much higher priced luxury cars... The car has style,class,room, a nice quiet ride,performance and is fun to drive. People in parking lots stop to admire the car. I know that it is not PC to own a vehicle that has performance, but, for me, this is a trip back in time,, I remember the first Hemis... Deiter (Chrysler CEO) hit a home run with this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The exterior design, particularly in the inferno red color, is a real head turner. I am 6'1" and wear a fedora hat. I never had a car I could so high; what a joy. The power is unreal. This car had all the features & options that would have cost me much more in a "luxury" car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V-8 340HP, AWD, adjustable pedals, GPS Navigation, trunk capacity, headroom and legroom HID lamps and most of all the design and low price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the first 300 in Nov. '06. At 429 miles I realized there were serious problems which the dealer said were not problems but normal driving. At 650 miles they finally replaced with a new car. At 449 miles it started doing the same thing the other had done. Took it in & the dealer said it was the Torque Converter and replaced that. Now it has a shimmy and bumps along the road. HATE THE CAR!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car drives well and my 250 HP engine performs good. Vehicle is very roomy. Rear visibility is not terrific. The vehicle is quiet and comfortable. The power gives a real sense of confidence on the road when the need to accelerate quickly. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE> I like the exterior design. The seats are so comfortable for long trips. I like the gas consumption, compared with my SUVs 8 cylinder. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I leased a 2007 300C AWD after coming off a two year lease on a 2005 Cadillac STS. Best move I ever made. The design, in Inferno Red, is a real head turner. The power and interior comfort can't be matched. With the options I took, I have very feature I could want, at an unbelievable low price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I just returned or our 2003 BMW-X5 after lease just ended. The Chrysler 300 is such a great car for the cost. I can almost say I like it more than the X-5 and its half the price. Don't figure! Hope this helps. We like it a lot!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The vehicle is a beautiful car and I have received numerous compliments from young and older people both. The car drives well and my 250 HP engine performs good. Vehicle is very roomy. Visibility is not terrific but with time and extra effort you learn the blind spots and how to compensate & can drive safely and with ease. The vehicle is quiet and comfortable. The power heated mirrors are really nice. I like having the Electronic Stability and Anti-lock 4-wheel disc brakes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the exterior design and feel this car will have good resale value and will be a Collector's Model in the future. I love the Heated Seats. My car has the Bentley Grill which is really nice looking and stands out.I also like the Tire Pressure warning light on dash.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my new 300c from it's classy looks to it's wonderful ride. The power gives a real sense of confidence on the road when the need to accelerate quickly presents itself. The interior is so comfortable. I love all the automatic features you can set such as the headlights and the wipers. The navigation system is great. The Boston Acoustic sound system has high quality sound. After driving SUVs for 10 years, I was concerned I would feel cramped in a sedan. Not so in the 300, the interior is quite roomy and there is lots of leg room. The trunk is quite spacious as well. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Hemi, of course!! I love the way it feels driving it and I love the way it sounds. In addition, the handling and ride is incomparable. The seats are so comfortable for long trips.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 300 Touring is a dream car for comfort and styling. The navigation system is a farce. I have a 250 Garmin handheld that is far superior to the $1800 for the navigation system. Alpine is not interested in working to improve or upgrade a very antiquated program disc. I have about 1900 miles on my vehicle and have been getting about 25 on the interstate. Ride is wonderful. Cruise control lever could be changed. Easy to hit it versus the turn signal. Sound system is outstanding. Styling is fantastic. Overall I am very please except for the navigation system.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had to get this car because my company went to company cars. I was driving an 05 Acura TSX. The 300 that I have has the ABS and the side curtain air bags. The base motor is just not powerful enough. I would have preferred the 3.5 motor, but it was not an option.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased an Inferno Red 07 300C on August 31st and it a dream. It drives beautifully, and rides just as nice. I got it almsot fully optioned accept for U-Connect and the Rear DVD system. I traded in an 04 PT Turbo and while I was satisfied with that, I am truly satisfied with the 300C. Thank you Chrysler for making such a good product. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The DVD Naviagion, and Satelite Radio would be the biggest things. I also love the walnut wood trim. To be honest I don't have anything that I don't like about it. </FAVORITE>
