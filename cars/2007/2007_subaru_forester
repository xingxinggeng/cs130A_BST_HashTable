<TEXT>My first new car in 25 years. It has exceeded just about all my expectations. It's great fun to drive and very responsive. It towed my pontoon boat with no problems. I've abused it with weekend excursions along the back roads of the Eglin AFB reservation -- sandy, soft roads often with deep mudholes. Came close, but haven't been able to get it stuck yet! And I've pulled out a few other drivers along the way. Don't get it into water too deep, though -- you'll ruin your charcoal canister, and they're expensive! My overall average fuel economy since new is 25.63 mpg -- that's with complete records through 62,000 miles. I enjoy this car thoroughly and would buy another in a heartbeat! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All wheel drive, huge sunroof, great fuel economy for an AWD car, excellent paint quality, excellent performance on extremely poor roads.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car used, when it was 18 months old. It has met or exceeded all of my expectations. It's fun to drive, comfortable on long trips, no problems at all. The driver controls are well laid out, the amenities are convenient, the engine power of my base model is more than adequate. The storage space is great! It's very fun to drive and makes me happy on a daily basis.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The excellent visibility in all directions; the secure handling on snow and ice; top ratings in crash tests.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm only 5'2"... not a lot of cars out there that can provide me with much needed comfort for visibility... But the Forester has changed it all. It is a joy to drive at all the times but up to a 45 degree up hill to the high way from a complete stop. I have the most joy driving through the severe snow storms!!! Unbelievable control in 6" snow! LOVE IT!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The number of cup holders and the storage compartment on the dash board. What a great thought! I love the SAFE feeling in a top rated 5-star eco- friendly small SUV.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife picked out a silver '07 forester XT Sport with manual transmission. This is an Awesome SUV with an emphasis on Sport. We live in Maine and I work at a ski resort. We put snow tires on the subie and we do much better than many other vehicles. At the same time this car is FAST. The stick doesn't have VDC which is okay because the sound of 4 wheels screeching is a beautiful thing. The dogs love the large cargo area, and the luggage rack easily carries everything else. This car has been from Miami to Maine and has handled everything the way we wanted. If you are looking for a do-it-all funmobile - this is it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Huge sunroof that opens all the way. TURBO!!! Heated seats for Maine winter. Starts at -30F.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looking for a small wagon with a ton-of-fun factor, then this is for you! Mine has a short-throw shifter, turbo gauge (visual toy) and heated leather seats (to warm ones hide on those chilly Minnesota Winters mornings). Our car delivered us to Colorado skiing, pheasant hunting in SD and canoeing in the BWCA, while allowing us to enjoy the scenery through the panoramic moon roof. The Forester Sport handles all tasks with ease, and the AWD triumphs over any treacherous weather condition encountered. It readily tows (2.4K lbs) with the trailer pkg, allowing us to haul our gear to the cabin and back with a minimum of fuss/muss. I can't say enough good about this car, it does what I need it to do</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The cars acceleration and nimble handling are quite phenomenal for a station-wagon/SUV hybrid. The interior is nicely appointed (automatic climate control, killer sound system), and the Sport has many of the luxury accoutrements (auto dimmer/compass mirror, cruise-control, heated-seats, etc.) desired.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>PROS: AWD, handling, simple controls, gas mileage. Getting 25 mpg, city/hwy. CONS: Lousy brakes, engine noises, road noise, ride quality, cheap interior materials, depreciation. Brakes have squealed and shuddered since new, despite 4 dealer visits (no, I don't ride the brakes). Motor exhibits a variety of rattles and clanks, dealer says "normal." Road noise is so pronounced on hwy, have to blast radio to hear it. Ride is rough at any speed. Seat fabric, carpet, headliner all cheap; driver seat began wearing immediately after purchase. Lastly, Subaru unkindly introduced '09 Forester in the middle of the '08 model year which trounced the value of mine. Going back to Toyota.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Surprisingly good gas mileage. Nice tight turning circle; handling almost sporty. Simple controls, user friendly.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Responsive engine. Excellent passing power in the mountains. So much torque that it normally doesn't have to shift down to pass. Large moonroof (twice the size of a normal one). Great ground clearance for rough roads and snow. VDC (stability control) came on this model and provides extra measure of security. We live where there is lots of inclement weather. Versatile interior with lots of head room.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine performance. Stability in bad weather and windy conditions. All Wheel Drive is better than system on Honda Pilot. Easy to drive. Great visibility. Unique body doesn't look like every other generic, mainstream SUV.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car in July of 2007 and the combined city/road gas mileage was 24 mph. As of about 8000 miles, when it was supposed to be broken in and getting better gas mileage, it dropped to 17mph. I have had it checked and talked to the guys at the dealer only to be given a ton of excuses and suggestions. Like, use Premium gas, only use top of the line stations, mix the regular/premium gas and they couldn't come up with anything wrong with the car after checking the engine. Not only that, make sure you know the dealer service and don't let them over fill the oil. Mine was way over the fill line. Not happy with the SUB. Terrible carpeting and they won't replace it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first Subaru and we have enjoyed the car so far. The car sticks to the road in rainy conditions, just as other Subaru owners told us. This is a definite plus. We are currently getting 29 mpg on the highway. We have a self imposed speed limit of 62-63 on interstate. which is why the mpg increased from 26 at 70-75 mph on trips.The major problem we have is with the rear drum brakes. They have squeeked for many months. The dealer states that this is an ongoing problem with the Forester, and Subaru has not found a remedy. We are thinking of trading up to one with disk brakes. I recommend to everyone thinking of buying a Forester. Add rear disk brakes to your requirement. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Subaru, coming after a Volvo 740 wagon. It was a sensible, practical, safe, and affordable option as compared to the Honda CRV and Toyota RAV4. No mechanical problems thus far with the vehicle. The front seats are very uncomfortable for long distances due to the lack of thigh and lumbar support and passenger seat does not push back far enough. The engine is simply underpowered when merging onto the highway and even more so when the car is fully loaded. The backseat leg room is poor. Plenty of cargo space. The fulltime AWD reduces the gas mileage to around 20-22 mpg in mixed driving, but the drivetrain does inspire confidence in wet conditions.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first Subaru and a pretty decent car overall, but some shortcomings. Brakes had to be adjusted for shuddering after purchase & now squeal at 12000 mi. Engine makes a variety of strange noises I have never heard in another vehicle. "Normal" says the dealer. A/T is sometimes rough; the dealer has advised me of a service bulletin which will hopefully cure the problem. Road noise is pronounced.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good ride, excellent handling, turns on a dime. 4 cyl is plenty peppy. AWD drive is a benefit even here in FL. Gas mileage is a real pleasant surprise-26.5 mpg in mixed driving. Simple guage and control layout is most appreciated. Manual driver seat is unexpectedly comfortable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This Forester has been in the shop more than my garage. The Climate control took 4 return visits before it was repaired. The seat fabric frayed at the edges right away. The seat covers were replaced. The brakes started failing around 14K miles. My wife was afraid to drive the car. The dealership replaced the master brake cylinder. The seats are not comfortable at all. They are very hard. My legs go numb driving and as a passenger in this car. We bought this without a trade in and thought we were getting a car that would last. I don't think so. There are many switches on the dash and they are confusing. I will never buy a Subaru again. This is my first and last</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The all wheel drive is good in snowy weather. It does get fairly good gas mileage. It has heated cloth seats. I do love this feature best.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Took the '07 Forester on a X-country trip. Beginning in IN, traveled a total of 7,000 miles thru St Dak, Montana, ID, Wash, Ore, CA, and Nevada. From the snow in Montana to the desert in Death Valley the car was able to handle temperature extremes from 120 to 32 degrees! In Death Valley, the only problem experienced was a slight overheating and a need to turn the air conditioner off. Solved the problem, but made for a very warm journey through the valley! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Think twice before buying this vehicle. We had a '98 & 2000 Forester. For the price, you couldn't ask for more. Purchased 2007 Forester in Jan. '07. Major complaint is the design area between the hood and windshield, the hidden vents, wiper motor, defroster, etc. Living in upstate New York, we have had three occasions where the snow & ice will accumulate on the wiper blades, arms, and in the space between hood & windshield, freezing, & preventing the wiper motor from working properly. Never happened with the '98 or 2000. Vents were on top & visible, not hidden. Subaru's answer, "get winter blades" or should have ordered premium pkg., $1000.+, includes deicer strip. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The concept of an affordable, reliable, highly rated, economical, AWD, almost SUV that can tow 2400# made this a dream car. But after 5000 miles I'm somewhat disappointed. The hillholder on the manual transmission is a PITA. It holds when you don't want it to and I feel like a drag racer winding up the engine and dumping the clutch to release it. If you're an experienced MT driver have them disconnect it before delivery. Otherwise, it's $40 to do it later. My other big disappointment is the cruise control, which slows/speeds up on ANY hill. The dealer says it's not supposed to work on hills but all my other cars have. They did a software fix today for the low speed lurching. We'll see.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>28.5 mpg, AWD that you nver notice (except accelerating out of wet corners), good low end grunt and gearing for towing. Good handling - not too soft, not too harsh.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first Subie - love it. Every morning I can't wait to get behind the wheel and slam the RPMs near red line. By the way mine is non-turbo. Took it off-roading today in the Marine Headlands and handled perfect in mud, wet grass, gravel, and pouring rain. I'm planning on putting winter Blizzacks for winter driving to Tahoe to fully appreciate the AWD. Added a bra, cargo box liner, Weathertech floor mats (a MUST), synthetic oil after 1K. This will not be my last Subie. Bring the Forester STI to the States!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD fantastic going about 60 mph and encountered a flooded slow lane the car in front of me had to pull to the left lane. My Subie went through the flood with no problem. Great sunroof. Easy to use controls. Large side mirrors with integrated turning signals a plus. Can't wait to ride to Tahoe!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great car for the price (under $20K). It is fun to drive and it handles corners very well. The storage capacity is very reasonable for its small size. I love the AWD, but it does take getting used to if you've never had it before. Fuel economy is just ok (about 22-25 mpg), but it runs on regular gas which is a huge plus. I spent slightly more on my last new car (1995 Infiniti G20) and this one has nearly as many features. I looked at a lot of cars (Hondas, Toyotas, and luxury preowned) and the Forester is by far the best car for the price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Forester XT is a great compromise between practical and fun to drive. It has all the practicality of a Subaru with AWD, lots of room to haul stuff and the Subaru reputation, plus with the turbocharged engine it is a blast to drive. The Forester is a bit outdated in terms of electronic features, no navigation or trip computer, the windows and moonroof require the key to be on and other little niceties are missing. But a super car overall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A sports car in disguise, a classic sleeper. Performance is similar to the WRX, and it doubles as a midsized family SUV and ski/soccer/beach hauling vehicle. Mom or Dad can drive their fun car, have decent gas mileage, and cart around all the family stuff in any weather or road conditions. It's a budget, sport, family SUV. So, for all it's plusses expect some cheapness, avg mileage, and the style and fit of a crossover off-road/family wagon. Still, above avg value, fun and practicality for the money, with good safety. Needs padded side columns, side curtain airbags, design that prevents water/snow drips on floor and seats, and a decent paint job to be a true 10.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good: Faasst, fast, fast even in 5th. Comparable to the WRX line for performance. Comfortable. Fast AC/heat, especially seat warmers. Great sound system, handling and visibility. Good driver position. Plenty of room. Pretty quiet. Cargo nets and tray, and deep floor mats invaluable extras.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Subaru, but it won't be my last. I appreciate the features and attractive interior that come with the LL Bean model. The ride is quiet and smooth with responsive steering. It handles the hilly and curvy desert roads where I live quite nicely. The AWD leads to only a slightly stiffer ride as compared to my Camry, but I have found it to be less stiff than any of the other SUVs I tried (including Volvo). With the LL Bean model you get a lot of nice upgrades for a very reasonable price. The A/C also works very well in our extreme temperatures.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Forester and 3rd Subaru. I really love the control and ease of these cars. Deep snow doesn't bother them at all. I like that I don't have to push a button to use all wheel drive. My LL Bean is similar to my previous 2003 XS except it now has power seats. The new dual valve system has taught me to drive with a light foot, otherwise the mileage suffers. I also don't use my brakes as much because the engine slows the car down when you let up on the gas.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Subaru and the AWD is excellent. After spending a good bit of time in the car you begin to realize that they are cheaply outfitted. The carpet is the skimpiest I have seen used in a car, the center console armrest is not well constructed and most of the storage is so small that it is only useful for storing gas receipts. The engine is a plus as the performance is good for a 4 cyl and the automatic transmission shifts well. The car performs well on snow covered roads and give a vey secure feeling under most driving conditions. The MPG is fair at 22 around town and a little over 25 on the highway. The only problem so far is a loose speaker in the right front door.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD is about the only plus, it does work well but there are a more good days than bad so I would not let the AWD feature guide my purchase. If you are looking to purchase one of these, I recommend that you rent one for a week and put some time in it. A test drive at a dealership is not enough.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It out-performs and gives me more satisfaction than all the other cars I've had before, including several Mercedes-Benzes, a Cadillac, Lincoln, Volvo, and Nissan. It has smooth handling, a great braking system, realistic road feel with its suspension, and excellent cargo space. The roomy interior is well-thought out with 8! cup holders, many storage areas, and just an overall superior design to those "luxury" cars. My wife, my adult daughter and I are in love with our Forester.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Forester. The first was a 2000S model. Not too many changes in features as far as I can see from a performance standpoint but it is a little noisier car. The suspension has changed and I don't find the ride to be as smooth. It seems to be a little sluggish once you take your foot off of the gas; sort of pulls back a little. I am, and always will be sold on the AWD feature and that's why I bought another one. It handles wonderfully in the snow. Not too sure of how it does in the rain. Haven't had the chance to tell yet. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the moonroof but maybe it's too big. Once you open it fully, all you see are the bars on the top of the car; it's not like you get an unobstructed view! And the indoor light is located too far back in the car now to give the driver enough light (in the front of the car) once you get in.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Owned for 1 month. Lots of fun to drive - corners like a sports car, gets decent mileage - and will climb like a 4WD vehicle. I tested it at the dealer on a nasty climb, and it shone. The responsiveness, compared to the Toyota RAV4, sold me. Gas mileage not as good as rated, but still decent. Averaging 20 - 21 with city driving. It's just plain fun to drive (even though it's not the turbo) and I find I like it more, day by day. I wanted 1. Good gas mileage. 2. The ability to carry things/tow. 3. Off road capability. 4. Reliability. I can't speak to the reliability yet, and I've been working too much to wander in the backcountry offroad - but on the other two counts, thus far, it delivers.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a 1998 Forester after only owning American cars. It now has 120K on it and I'm still driving it. The LL Bean has all the features including a sunroof that is larger than any I've seen, almost a convertible! The heated leather seats are my wife's favorite feature. My favorite feature is the cargo space (the LL Bean has the "tuff stuff" liner for durability) and the handling. No other car does AWD better. It laughs at Midwest winters. The new climate control is a good feature along with all the cup holders a man could want. The 6 disk sound system that plays MP3s is great, I don't hear the same tune for weeks! This won't be the last of the Foresters in our family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a good car. In California, it's a partial zero emissions vehicle. As pollution free as a Prius. It handles well. The ride is a bit harsher than a Camry, which I'm accustomed to. Fuel economy, after only 1000 miles, has been about 23 mpg average. It holds the road well, has enough room for four and groceries. I can tow a small boat and drive on marginal roads.

<TEXT>This is my first Subaru. I've owned mostly Toyotas. I love the Boxer engine and the feel of AWD. I put two of my buddies inside for a spin and surprised them when the front end "launched" straight up when accelerated. From the outside this car looks like a soccer-mom transport.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Intercooled turbo w/ working hood scoop. Great stereo for factory.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The ride in this 2007 Forester is terrific, and apparently Subaru has made some minor changes that customers wanted: there's a holder for the iPod, for instance, and road noise is minimal. I've been driving small SUVs for about 10 years, and this is the best car yet--best handling, most comfortable,and best looking.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling is excellent, and the look is impressive. So far, the moonroof has withstood harsh Florida rains with no problem (no leaking).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 07 Forester is the best of all worlds for a small SUV. Runs on regular unleaded and I am getting just under 30 mpg on the highway. Service is very good from my local dealer. The standard all wheel drive is awesome in the rain. Good price point for all you get on a Subaru.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The all wheel drive, and the price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Generally pleased with purchase. Tiny engine has great pickup and can climb hills. Car rides hard as though it needs shocks. Has all the characteristics of the old poorly made Japanese models of years ago. Car has "tinny" sound. Road noise is very objectionable. Can't hold conversation. It is only satisfactory as will be used for local trips only. Rate it 6 out of 10. Not worth cost. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>LL Bean trim, engine does well, roomy front for 6'1" driver. Overall appearance is good. Sound system is o.k. Like 6-disk CD very much.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought my Subaru this month. I am slightly disappointed in the mileage. I get 23 in town but my highway drive is 25.5. I am hoping this will get better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I think it is fun to drive and I feel very confident in the way it holds the road. It feels very solid. I like that a lot.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Big fan of Subaru for over 20 years. This is the best vehicle I've ever owned. Living in Maine was quite the experience with the harsh winters. It would be 60 below zero in January and my Subaru would start every time. Also, excellent traction and control in the snow.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>On my new one, my favorite feature is the climate control option. You set the temperature you want, and it brings it there without fiddling around with the knobs and controls. I also love the stereo system. Quality sound.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you are looking for a practical, dependable, and overall fun car to drive the Forester is it. I wouldn't trade this car for a large SUV, because it does everything and more that the competition can, (and you won't go broke in the process). The premium package is worth the extra money. I'm glad I upgraded, the MP3 jack is great, and so is the climate control and heated seats.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD (the all wheel drive) is by far the best part about this car. Rain and snow are no match for this little tank. And you don't have to worry about it, it's always there working for you.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my Forester for almost a month, put on 750 miles, averaging 26.5MPG mixed highway and city. So far, I've been pleasantly surprised by the handling and smooth ride. I've owned Toyotas for 8 years previously and did not expect the Forester to drive as well but it compares very favorably. The interior finish is not as refined as my Toyotas were but it's acceptable. Overall, it's a solid vehicle with everything I need.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Oversize moonroof is nice, general handling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I like the "evenness" or the ride and the feeling of good control. It went off the road (2 tires on pavement, 2 on dirt) to avoid a head-on collision with no loss or compromise of control. I especially like the moonroof feature - perhaps I noticed this because it is summer and it hasn't rained yet. I like the built in audio aux jack.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Speaker system. Moonroof.</FAVORITE>
