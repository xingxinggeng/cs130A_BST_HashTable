<TEXT>I had originally intended to purchase the Kia?s parent company?s Santa Fe because my mother has one and I am extremely impressed with the vehicle ? so is my mother. I decided to purchase the Rondo instead because of the somewhat smaller outside dimensions. The funny thing is that the Rondo with the smaller outside actually is larger inside than the Santa Fe. Four things stand out with this car. First of all the comfort, I am 6?2? and even with the sun roof have more than enough room and the seats are extremely comfortable. Second is the ride, in a word fantastic! Third would be quiet cabin and forth would be the fuel mileage. I have consistently got over 27 mpg on hwy running at</TEXT>

<TEXT>I must be the only Rondo owner that has a completely loaded car. Leather, spoiler, I have everything on it including the grown effects, that make the car look much more sporty. $20,800 out the door price. The car has taken 3 2000 mile trips to Arizona. It's the most comfortable riding for long distances. My BMW seats are not as comfortable as the Rondo's. The MPG and gas tank size are could be better. The optional Infinite radio upgrade wasn't worth the price. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable seats and large windshield for excellent viewing. No car I know has more room in the rear seats. The V6 has plenty of get up and go.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the Kia Rondo to replace an Eagle summit wagon I had had for years. The Rondo has been a good Car. Now has 27,000 miles on it. No repair needed. I have grown to dislike the car however because it handles so poorly. The steering wheel has some uncomfortable vibration at around 65 mph, and the cabin is noisy at highway speeds. I have to crank up the volume on the radio to hear anything. I could have bought a much nicer car for a little more money. The worst part is the resale value. If you want a small van that will hold its value better, the Mazda 5 is much better. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car used and it is a very good car! I have the V6 and it has a lot of get and go. The engine just purrs. The only minor complaint might be that the seats do stain a little but as long as you are not a slob, they are fine. The car is just the right size, not too big like a mini van and not too small. Plenty of room! I recommend this car to anyone with a small family.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car mid 2007 and I really appreciated it. It is very reliable, performs very well. I traveled to CA (LA and San Diego), Grand Canyon and Las Vegas and also inside AZ state and in all trips the performance was outstanding besides the road conditions (ice, rain, desert). Also for my day-to-day activities has a good performance and it is very safe. My wife really appreciated it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2007 EX after owning a Siena minivan for years and briefly owning a 2006 Scion xB. I compared this car with the CR-V, Vibe, Forester, Legacy wagon and other "near SUVs." The Rondo had far and away the best space utilization and features for the price. Seating position is nice and high, visibility is excellent, but handling is dull. Drives way too much like my old Siena and not enough like the zippy xB. Build quality is good (I've owned 10 Hondas, Nissans, Toyotas and Mazdas to compare with), although carpet in cargo area is cheap. I'm OK with the MPGs, which range from 19 to 27. The Rondo is a real car, unlike my xB, which was so devoid of features it was ridiculous.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Room inside compared with compact dimensions outside, quietness, comfort, uniqueness of design. I like the 5- speed automatic with auto shift capabilities, the under-floor storage in the hatch area, the multiple interior lights and cup holders. A very practical car without all the SUV inefficiencies.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased this car a year ago and have been extremely unhappy with the performance in the winter. If it snows less or more than an inch of snow the car will not move it does nothing but spin. It also was parked on a lawn and had to be towed out for it would only spin up mud and not move. I have brand new all season radial on this car and still it cant get out of its own way. The rack that is provided by the factory is terrible I am scared to put my kayaks on them for fear that the rack is to weak & it will break under the pressure. It also does not go wide enough to accomodate the length of the kayaks. Over all this vehicle is to light for the maine winters and I have been very unhappy. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The only favorite parts to the vehicle for me is the Stereo and the size. It is small but when you need the larger size you have it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my Rondo in March of 08,and am elated with my purchase. I always owned American made prior to this but I have to say that I love this Rondo. Have put over 18,000 miles with no problems. Went on 2 trips, one in the Ozark Mountains, I4 and transmission did exceptional with plenty of power and smooth downshifting when needed. Love the roomy interior and seating position.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I posted on this car about a year ago, I loved it then and I love it more now! This car is great in the snow!! I cant believe it, just 2 days ago, we got about 10 inches of snow in Grand Rapids MI. During that storm we had to go out. That car just plowed through it, without the roads plowed yet! I am very pleased with this car. We get good mileage, about 21 mpg every time, mostly city. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car alternative to larger van or SUV. We wanted something we could occasionally haul more than 5 people in, and this is perfect. I am 6'1" and can comfortably fit in the third row for short trips. We seriously explored purchasing a Canadian model, as they have power driver seat, trip computer and auto climate control. Don't misinterpret the long list of suggested improvements - I love this car and would buy again, but these are things to look at when you are thinking of buying. I am glad I got the 2007 model, as 2008 deleted a few key features. I haven't heard the base level stereo, but I am not sure that the upgrade stereo was worth the cost. I also was expecting better MPG.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Small on the outside, big on the inside. Seat warmers. Good handling, easy maintenance. Reliable. Excellent value, esp when looking at competition for 6-7 seaters. Mazda5 only seats 6 and underpowered. Rav4 costs more and 3rd row is more cramped. Headlights take some getting used to, but are good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased a black Kia Rondo with beige fabric interior. From the first week of ownership had problems with water stains on the seat. The dealership detailed the interior several times to clean the stains which led to additional stains, each time trying new protectants which they stated should take care of the problem. According to the service manager Kia could replace the seats with the same fabric, at the time we decided to try the new fabric protector. One year later my interior looks like we have poured liquid all over, every stain shows, many from water. I am very frustrated, would not recommend fabric interior. I know if I try to sell my car this will lower the value.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Took our '07 Rondo on a 3800 mile trip back to the midwest and was well satisfied with the handling and comfortability of this little crossover from our friends in Asia. Fuel mileage fit well within the EPA rating 21 to 29 mpg, where we got an avg of 26 mpg on the trip, and that was having the A/C on, cruise on at 80 mph. From graduating from an econobox on long trips to this Rondo, I never tired from sitting in this vehicle. Well worth the money these vehicles are priced at.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Radio/CD unit is acceptable. Flat fold down rear seats makes it wonderful to haul items without having that blessed hump to make packing unbearable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the micro van the US manufactures should be knocking off! Tweak the styling a little and you have a top seller for the next decade! 5 star safety, stability control, tire pressure monitor, 6 air bags, 100k warranty, quieter/larger than Rav/CR-V, 30 mpg driven @65-70 and handles fine. I'm a picky auto enthusiast/motorcycle guy and I can't believe how dumb US auto executives are! You can buy a 4 cylinder with air out here in the NW for as little as $14K/15K plus tax. That's several thousand less than a honda civic/etc! The motor is bulletproof with a cam chain on the four banger, you get alloys and a complete power package.Come on Chevy/Ford/Chrysler! Knock it off with your styling tweaks!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought vehicle in July to drive x- country. My Rondo was more comfortable than it's replacement or my 04 Subaru Outback. Gas mileage was also respectable; over 2900 miles of mostly hwy driving, Rondo averaged approx 20 MPG. While driving through CA desert car cabin was comfortably cooled by AC. MPG heavily reduced by speed exceeding 60 MPH, and use of AC. Have found that on my 80 mile RT work commute, which is mainly hwy, mileage drops well below 20 MPG. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am not the perfect guy to get great mileage.(4 cyl.) My job requires a lot of in town driving and some idling. In Texas, if you have an outside meeting, you get into someones car with the a/c on. After 6 months, I have had only 1 tank of gas that got over 22 miles to the gallon. The pro's make this still a great purchase. I got the last 07 and got my car for under 15k. I would do it again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this for the stated mileage. Our 1999 Suburban averages 11-12 mpg. The Rondo was supposed to get 29 mpg. We've never come close. We use it primarily for getting around town (avg = 20 mpg) and an occasional trip (avg = 24 mpg). For a 4 cylinder automatic and I'd hope for higher gas mileage because it's such a LITTLE car compared to our Suburban. We're in our sixties and drive conservatively. That's our only disappointment. No squeaks or rattles in 11,000 miles. We change the oil regularly. It is a VERY dependable car. Can't compare the ride with a Suburban (even ours with 200K miles). Trip distances over 100 miles are uncomfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car!!! This car has won me over. As a former Chevy Subn driver I have a hard time getting into just any vehicle. At 6'4" 370 I am no small twig. The Rondo has great room and a very peppy 4 cyl. I have only had the car about 4 months but so far I love it. There are a few things which could be improved upon but the pro's far outweigh the cons. I am going to miss my 4 wheel drive in the winter, but hey, let's face it, going from an average of 8 mpg to 20 mpg is a big difference. This car has exceeded my expectations and is definitely worth a look. Roomy, peppy and nice on the twisties, my Rondo was a great deal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy, lot's of under the floor storage space. Peppy 4 cyl has plenty of giddy up. Great infinity stereo system, steering mounted controls, ESC and traction control standard, 4 wheel disc brakes, handles great, and is amazingly smooth on good roads.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have now had my Kia Rondo for 4 months, and I am truly glad I purchased it. It has so much room, is very comfortable even on long distance trips, and truly feels like you are driving a much larger car. You sit up high in the Rondo and visibility is great. The console is jutted forward, so all buttons for the radio, CD player, heat/air are right there at arms length. The car is so quiet when idling, I sometimes forget that it is on while sitting at a drive-thru. Acceleration is also good when trying to get on the highway. I don't regret my purchase one bit. Take a test drive - that's all it took for me!</TEXT>

<TEXT>As our old mini van was on it last legs, we came across the Rondo. I am glad we did! It is a good car at a very reasonable price. It is the perfect size for our family of 4. We have taken it on long trips and find it has the room to haul all our stuff and is very comfortable. The only complaint I have is that the seats stain for no reason. It is like the stains are coming from the inside of the site. Cleaning with water only makes it worse. I have contacted Kia about this issue but have not gotten a reply just yet. The roadside assistance is also a great feature. My wife picked up a screw in her tire and called. They showed up quickly and were able to patch the tire on the spot.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is roomy and the controls are laid out very well; although the some are hard to read in bright sunlight if you have sunglasses on. I love the under the floor board storage in the rear of the vehicle. They have made the most of all the space in the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall this car has exceeded virtually every expectation. It is fun to drive, very roomy, gets decent fuel economy for a vehicle that seats, and looks pretty good as well. I'm averaging around 19 mpg in town and between 25-27 mpg on the hi-way at around 75 mph with the a/c running. The V-6 is exceptionally smooth, as is the transmission. There is plenty of room for my family of 5 and our dog when we travel. On the down side, the seats in my car (beige interior) are very easy to stain. I'm beginning to wonder how well they are going to hold up over the long term. But, other than that, I'm sold on Kia. I got the car for 2.9% financing for 5 years. What a deal!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My last two vehicles were an 04 Titan and an 06 Spectra5. The Titan was awesome but awful on gas. The Spectra 5 was awesome on gas but too cramped. When I took the Spec5 in for it's 30K I got a rental Rondo and I traded in the Spec5 that day. I'm happy with the Rondo. Power is decent with the I4. The auto is slow to downshift. I use the manual shift feature a lot. Mileage is decent, 26- 27 hwy, best is 31.5 MPG @ 65 MPH. Comfort is really good for me (6'7"). The interior is extremely spacious and useful. I mainly carry myself and my bicycles around. I can stack 2 bikes in the back with the front wheels detached. I usually get a new car every 24 months but this one's a keeper.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Rondo new and love it. Just hit 1000 miles, handles great rides like a sports car with a softer feel on bumps, gas mileage is lacking (6cyl) not close to what the sticker says average 23 on highway. But other than that has all the bells and whistles that higher priced cars have and feels safe and secure on the road, went from a Subaru Legacy wagon, huge improvement for our family, very easy with kids car seats,lots of room in front for drivers (5'10"230 lb football player) and man can it move when you need it to,long drives are now fun but city driving will kill your wallet,but worth it, don't miss out on this for a better name brand car is worth the test drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Awesome power off the line for a 4 banger. Quite smooth ride. Just got out of a Saturn ION, so I'm spoiled by gas mileage but at 53 yrs old I'm tired of falling into and dragging myself up and out of a compact car. The Rondo is a perfect in and out. I'm sure the mileage will get better as I only have less than 700 miles on it so far. I'm a semi retired rock musician so if I need the space for my gear I have it. My wife drives an '07 Sportage and is less than satisfied with the mileage, but she wanted an SUV so I told her not to expect great mileage. She had an' 03 Optima but decided she wanted an SUV. All in all I'm in love with my Rondo and this is our third new KIA. Very reliable vehicles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very roomy and comfortable. Lots of spunk for a 4 banger. Very attractive in and out. The gas mileage should get better as time goes on as I don't have a heavy foot. Great visibility and I don't need tinted glass as I have nothing to hide. Solid, tight, well built vehicles.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After looking around for over a year (we knew our old car wasn't going to last much longer), we decided to get a Rondo. We had gone to the Chicago Auto Show two years running to see a variety of cars, check out the new models, etc. and all of us loved the Rondo we saw this year best of all (missed it last year). When our old car went into its last gasps we went to test drive it - smooth and great to drive. At the time we bought our Rondo the 08s weren't on the lot, but with the deal we got we are quite happy with our 07. My SO, who has a thing against minivans and SUVs (conspicuous consumption) likes our wagon solution; the kids love the room; and I like being able to haul a few friends.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car for my wife, but I must say I love it just as much. I drive it to work for 50 miles on the highway and it is very quite and handles quite well. I have not noticed any blind spots and everything is at your finger tips. Night time driving is also very good as the Driving lights and Fog lights are very bright. Also braking and acceleration are just as good and it comes with great Michelin tires. Interior Lighting is also good and lots of interior connectors for those portable CD players - 1 front, 1 mid, and 1 in the rear as well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the steering wheel volume controls and 5 disc CD, Mp3, Stereo with Quality speakers - very loud. Extra power plugs for Portable devices.

<TEXT>I replaced a Jeep I'd had for 6 years. I wanted a car offering good visibility, top safety features, good styling, heated leather seats, easy to get in and out of, not too glitzy, good compartments for storage. I did not need a 3rd row of seats. I drove the comparable cars, as well as other Kia models; chose the Rondo because it offered everything I was looking for. I would not compare the Rondo to minivans, no matter what reviewers say - it's in a class of its own. I get compliments all the time. It's sporty, attractive exterior styling, and roomy interior. It holds a lot of cargo! I've owned my Rondo for over a year, and I'd definitely buy another one</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned a 2007 Rondo since Labor Day 2007. Never considered a Kia. We looked at the Vue, Mazda 5, HHR, and Dodge Caravan before stumbling on the Rondo. Surprising to see so few on the road! Nice comfortable vehicle to drive. Lots of storage areas in car, and easy to configure car to store larger items. Our goal was a fuel efficient vehicle with lots of safety equipment, and this care fits that bill. Excellent vision out of the front windshield (minivan-like). Definitely recommend this car for families on a budget, but whom don't want to sacrifice safety of you & your kids!! Give this vehicle a try - glad we did. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Visibility out the vehicle. Fuel efficiency - average 26.5 mpg between highway & city driving! Storage spaces & nooks, especially in the back. Can store toolbox, and other emergency equipment. Wife likes the pocketbook hook on passenger side. Radio sounds good for basic model. Comfortable ride!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Back in August of 2007, we bought a Kia Rondo, it was very smart move. It gets great gas mileage, we are getting an average of about 23 mpg. We love it. It is easy to get in and out of, great visiblity and handling. Our only issue with it is when you have to drive through puddles of water, you temporarily lose your power steering. But there is a button you can push, and then you will not lose it. We live here in MI, and the last few days we have been getting blizzards, and with the ESC, it is great, it automatically pumps the brakes and keeps the car in control when you start to slide. I would recommend this car to anyone.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Plenty of storage, and great ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First let me put my review in perspective by saying that I bought the Rondo as wagon for commuting and recreational activities; I didn't need a third row and this is not my primary family vehicle. I thought I wanted a small/mid-size SUV until I tested them and discovered that they lean in curves too much for my liking, and what I really wanted was car-like handling with SUV space/flexibility. The Rondo is the vehicle that offered that combination with a higher seating position and decent gas mileage. I like the Vibe/Matrix, but the engine was not powerful enough, the backseat had no leg space and the cargo area is much smaller than the Rondo's. Great deal for the money!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Car-like handling/ride and gas mileage with SUV space/flexibility and higher seating position. Smooth, quiet and powerful engine/ride and manual shifting option is great. Under-floor cargo-area storage bins are very nice. V6, leather, sunroof and premium stereo for under $20K is hard to beat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Rondo was an interest to me because of the fuel mileage and 7 seats. It has a great amount of room in the inside but doesn't look like a huge vehicle. Fuel mileage is okay not as great as I expected. In the snow and over bumps the brakes are locking up on me. I took it to the dealer and they say that they found no problem. I almost got into 2 accidents at 10 or 20 miles an hour. I might try snow tires. I was given no help at the dealership. I don't feel safe driving in the snow and I have owned a lot of different cars and am not afraid of the snow but in this vehicle I am afraid and I will not be able to drive when the roads have snow on them.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are 7 seats and storage capacity.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have a Chrysler Voyager Minivan, and this Rondo is the preferred vehicle of the household. Great storage space, and roomy front and back seats, even with a car seat. I love all the extras they give you with this Ex model. This has more standard features than the Voyager had, and is much more fun to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Having a six disk cd player is nice and sunroof. The saftey features are awesome,stability control, anti-lock brakes and the many air bags, especially with children in the vehicle. </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>So Far So Good</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Test drove many cars before I settled on my Kia Rondo. Found this to be the best fit for my family. My husband is over 6 feet tall & 200 lbs and still has plenty of head room and leg room. In the front and back seat. Mine has a third row seat we will probably never use but is nice to have. However, it is made for a small person or child. 3rd row sits very low and is for short trips only. Have only had my Kia for 3 weeks, but so far only one problem experienced. Found if the front windows are up and rear windows are down, there is a very loud sound vibration in the car. Not pleasant at all. Overall though a nice car to ride in and drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>No auto head lights or running lites but will turn off automatically when the driver door is opened, so just as good if you leave them on all the time.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With 2 small kids, our Quest minivan was more than we needed. The 7 passenger Rondo fit our needs perfectly. Normally configured with just 2 rows of seats for the 4 of us but with an optional 3rd row for family or visitors to prevent having to take 2 cars places. It test drove very nice w/great handling & enough "get up & go" in the 6-cyl to get out into traffic in a pinch. We were able to load it up w/ALL of the bells & whistles. Yes, the rear seat is tight, but I'm 6'2" and can get back there w/about 2" to spare between my knees the middle row. Great warranty & crash tests too! Very happy!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a 2007 Rondo EX V6 Luxury in Aug. To say I am pleased is an understatement. I traded my 98 Legacy wagon on it, and though it lacks AWD, the Rondo is quite adept at handling our snowy December (our dealer added a set of studded winter tires on rims as part of the deal). I like the handling, the acceleration, the brakes, the looks, the comfort, the practicality, the quality - I like everything! The 3rd row seats are great at toting an occasional 5th or 6th passenger, and provide lots of space when folded. Everything works so smoothly and efficiently - the seats tumble or fold so well, the controls are smooth, etc. What a car! Truly one of the best values in autodom today.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The features are all nice, but the ones that I appreciate the most are the windshield wiper de-icers, the outside mirror de-icers, the 6 airbags, and the neat every-automaker- should-have-it purse hook on the right of the centre console. It is great for holding a snack bag for trips with the kids.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>An underrated overperformer! It's surprising to me that Car & Driver and other car reviewers have not given this car the same marks as those who own it. Those in the know love it! A superb family car for an incredibly low price! We've done trips of 1000K plus w/ 4 adults and two kids (and thule box) in comfort. Pretty interior, great stereo. Drop into 4th or 3rd when passing and you have NO worries on hills or passing - make the six cylinder work! It can handle it. Slide middle row forward and you can get six adults in -- although tight. Looked at Ford Freestyle; Escape; Mazda 5; and others. By far this was the best for the money. Get the six cylinder.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tight handling in mountain curves, some understeer. Enough power on steeps if you keep the revs high. Cruises smooth at 80 on flats. Great soccer dad/mountain car -- needs snow tires in winter, but handles 10% grade in snow no prob. Brakes adequate. Acceleration adequate.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We traded a Buick minivan (2 yrs old), and couldn't be happier. No mechanical problems at all with this car. We love it. We have 8,000 miles on it. The only drawbacks are that it never gets the advertised hwy mileage (we only get 24-26 MPG tops), and the road noise is evident when on a bumpy highway/road. The features of this car were better than the traded vehicle (at half the price)--antilock AND stability control AND airbags all around. Feels very safe, and I really enjoy driving it. Can't go wrong at this price for a 7 seater! Will buy from KIA again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Kia and am even more impressed with the Rondo than I was with my Sephia. Great ride, great comfort, great features, great price, we opted for the 100k/10 year warranty (bumper to bumper) for an extra 1k which translates to no worries for a very long time. My wife and I love it as a "touring car" with those great windows we can take in all the great views.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 8000 km, here is how I compare it to my previous 2002 PT Cruiser Limited. Turns shorter, rides better, speedometer easier to read, seats almost as good, fuel consumption 15% better at 8.4 l/100km, roomier, better visibility, more sun/sky glare that's a no no, tailgate stays cleaner of dust and mud, 2 inches more road clearance is important on snow and back roads, I miss PT's sturdy rear shelf, Electrically heated seats work well in Alberta, drives good but does not hold the road as good as "the little TANK". Great access for an old geeser of 79. PT was great for 103,000 trouble-free kms but that low road clearance did me in, road garbage cost the PT a radiator.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Kia hit the nail on the head by creating a vehicle that's got the footprint of a compact but can handle 7 passengers, or 5 and a bunch of stuff. I chose the Rondo over a fwd RAV4, and saved about $5K. Very well put-together and drives well, but feels somewhat like an appliance. Not a lot of soul in the driving experience. But performs better than average where it counts: space, safety, economy, value, features.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am in the midwest and have driven American cars for several years now. I feel we in midwest have a special bias towards the big 3, just because of our proximity to Detroit. I have to admit I was really scared to try Kia for the first time. I have found Kia Rondo to be an exceptionally functional car with a lot of cool features, Excellent mileage for all that space and fabulous price. I was thinking of considering Toyota or Honda but could not find anything close in the price range and/or mileage that Rondo has offered me. Also, I feel the warranty scheme is just something that speaks for itself!! I am a very proud first time KIA owner now!! </TEXT>

<TEXT>As an over 50, I find the Rondo fun to drive. Would love a power seat though. Seats are big and comfy but don't drop anything down between the seat and the console! They should provide an extraction tool! Suggested improvements - move the high beam indicater down a bit, it gets blocked by the top of the wheel. As a smoker I would love pop open rear 1/4 windows.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased April 2007. Current mileage 4100. This Rondo had big shoes to fill as it was to replace a 2004 Honda Odyssey, the sport car of mini-vans. Well, Rondo did a great job, in a smaller package. Smooth and quiet drivetrain performance. Huge interior room for the size vehicle. Fantastic all-around visibility when driving. Great standard safety (air bags, ABS, ESC, 4-wheel disc brakes, etc) features. Quiet ride at any speed. Firm, well proportioned seating. Fit and finish every bit as good as Honda (have owned five). V6 has more than adequate power, and a silent smoothy. No problems to date. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After checking out the Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CR-V, which were too SUV-ish for my tastes, I looked at the Rondo. I wanted the seating and cargo of a minivan, and the Rondo has it in spades, without the bulk or low MPG of a full minivan. The Rondo is the least expensive V6-powered 7-seater on the market, but its build quality is on par with the costlier CR-V. The second row floor has no noticeable transaxle hump! The 3rd row is not as cramped as most reviews say, when the 2nd row is moved forward a little. I've only had it 4 months, and I've already had several compliments!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent seating height (no stepping up or crouching down into the seats), and more than ample shoulder room in front. Go for the 3rd row seat, like I did; it's way more useful than the small underfloor storage in the 2-row models. Oh, and big cupholders galore!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was originally going to buy a new Toyota RAV4 until I drove the new Rondo. The KIA was far more vehicle for the money. The Rondo has more features that count as standard equipment than the RAV4, such as a rear climate control duct for heating and AC. Build quality and design were equal to Toyota's RAV4 and the warranties far exceeded any of the Japanese manufacturers (5 yrs/60K basic and 10 yrs/100K drive train). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car is loaded with standard features including front and side airbags, ABS brakes, vehicle stability control, power steering, power windows, power locks, AC, reclining front and rear seats, adjustable rear climate controls, storage bins/pockets everywhere and 7500 mile maintenance intervals.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Very versatile. We only shopped for 7 passenger vehicles. I was hesitant at first, but now I drive it more than my wife does. This has come in handy more than we thought. There are many small items that come in handy, the 12v plug in the rear, rear cargo light, the 12v plug in the console with the cable guide so it will close and not crimp the wire. 2nd row ac vents are also very nice in allowing air to circulate. Tons of cargo space!! Plenty of cup holders helps with kids. Test drive it and you won't believe the visibility or how quiet and enjoyable your ride will be!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cup holders, 12v plugs, 3rd row seating, 5 year roadside assistance and a 10 year warranty!! Tilt, cruise, CD, middle ac vents, and the gas cap holder so you don't scratch your paint job at the pump!! Tons of extras for a great price!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Value on this car is great, but as a 6' 6" 300lb man, this car is a tall ride. There is head room to spare and my legs have space to roam. The Rondo was a surprise test drive and sold me from the moment I sat down. I cannot say enough good things about the space for me and my family, all tall kids and one small wife! We love it. Drives smoothly, good mileage and for a small van/wagon it looks nice too. The best out of 3 months of looking, test driving and researching.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Space planning on this car is par none. I tried all models under $20000 and not one had head and leg room for a tall drink like me. The third row is great for small ones or the extra teen that can squeeze in. Did I mention the roominess!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We're small car people (this replaced my wife's Golf), but wanted something that would comfortably hold our 2 kids (1 in bulky carseat, 1 in booster) plus a 3rd adult on occasion. The Kia was the clear winner both on paper and in test drives. After 5 weeks and a 1,000 mile trip, we are very happy with our choice. The V6 and its 5-speed auto are peppy, responsive, quiet, and smooth. Feels expensive. The driving position is comfortable both for my wife (who had trouble with others) and for me. Cargo space isn't huge but was fine for our family vacation, including pack-and- play, stroller, beach gear, etc. How nice that our cheapest option turned out to be the best!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After reading positive reviews here, we decided to trade in our Trailblazer for the Rondo with better gas mileage as our primary goal. I drive the Kia mostly to work and back with about 1/2 of the driving being interstate highway and the rest in city. My gas mileage has averaged 22 mpg - not fantastic but better than the 17 I got with the Trailblazer. We just returned from a trip through the mountains in WY & ID and actually did 28 mpg there. The car has plenty of zip on on-ramps, which is where I usually drive. If I were going to be in mountainous areas very often, though, I'd want the V6. The 4 of us had plenty of room for bodies and luggage. Overall, we love the car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Our 4 year old actually noticed and commented on the big windows. The visibility is great. My 280 lb husband has plenty of room. The teenager thinks rear leg room is better than the Trailblazer. Rear cargo is easier to access and provides lots of room with "hidden" storage areas. Extra cupholders!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After test driving this vehicle, my wife and I liked the roominess of the Rondo vs our previous two vehicles. However we are kind of disappointed in the mpg as it is advertised for 27 mpg on the highway and we're getting about 22.75 avg through 5000 miles. We thought that we would be able to absorb the additional cost of negative equity on our previous vehicle with the lesser mpg on this vehicle. However with bigger discrepancy in mpg and the huge rise in gas prices it's not as economical as first thought. However we do enjoy the spacious cabin and the power of the small V6 engine. And the overall performance has been satisfactory for the most part.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought the Rondo Ex V6 5 seater in Urban Gray. This 5 seater is very comfortable. So far it has been everything I'd expected and more. It drives well, is quick enough to weave through traffic with enough glass to see everything. Without the 3rd row seat you get extra storage under the floor which is perfect for hiding stuff like laptops. With the back seat down it is perfect for a couple of big dogs and tons of stuff. With the seats up it is not a bad place to be for big people. The Rondo EX looks are... ah, it has a nice "personality". OK, it looks better than the LX. Overall I really like it. The manual-matic even makes it fun to drive. Tons of space. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Rondo is roomy, excellent for elderly parents to get in and out of, okay on gas, looks great and handles well. However, I am taking it back for repairs for the third time for the gear shift locking, the ESC light coming on and off, the brake does not disengage the cruise control (very scary) and now the cover on the steering wheel that covers the air bag has come loose and rattles. But, still would recommend the car for other features. Hopefully the dealership can fix these problems for good this time. Did I get the only lemon? After having the 2004 Optima, I was very impressed with Kia and its warranty program.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Room - the fact that the back door makes it easy for an elderly person with hip replacements able get in and out with ease was the main reason I bought it.

Even with two kids and a dog I just couldn't do a full size minivan. No one can believe the interior room or the quiet comfortable ride of this car. The back seat has significantly more leg and head room than our Subaru Outback. Also, with the V6, it is much faster than the Subaru too. The third row seat is tight but it's fine for the extra kid or two you end up with after soccer games. With the back seats down you're left with tons of cargo space.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First of all, the Rondo is not an SUV, a station wagon or just a plain car. It is a people mover, cargo mover and won't get lost in a sea of cars in a parking lot. I have a 5 seat EX I4, with Premium Package. The exterior design is different, and everyone can draw their own opinions. It has a smooth ride on city streets, tracks well on highways. There is almost no wind noise at speed. Fit and finish is impeccable. Interior materials are highly acceptable for this price range. The 4 cylinder engine is powerful enough for most. The interior is spacious. The under floor storage is huge. My only complaint is that the stereo display is almost impossible to read without direct sunlight on it. </TEXT>

Roomy, well thought out, lots of storage, decent legroom in the back for an adult. For a 4 cylinder, the engine has a lot of pep. We don't get it out on the highway much, so the fuel economy is suffering some (barely over 20 MPG), but have just hit 3000 miles, so I'm expecting it to improve somewhat.</TEXT>

Overall impression: If you're just starting a family or just want a nice vehicle to drive around in it would be hard to find a better deal than the Kia Rondo!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The amount of storage is amazing, still finding storage places.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really wanted to buy an American car (be patriotic) but nothing America makes compares to the Rondo. I desired both a decent hauling capacity and good gas mileage. These 2 things work against each other except with the Rondo. With the rear seat folded and the front passenger seat pushed forward a 6 footer can stretch out and take a nap. I dropped the oil at 700 miles and refilled with Mobil 15-20 synthetic. Over my last 3 fillups I have averaged 26 MPG. About 80% of my driving is at highway (60-65) speeds. At 3300 lbs. the 162 HP 4 cylinder engine has more than adaquate power for passing and merging on the freeways. The Rondo is a well though out and engineered vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage; interior room; visibility; raised driving position; rear under the deck ice cooler and extra storage areas (in the 5 seater); included cassette player along with the CD player; many standard features including front and side air bags. Best warrantee in the auto business.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is really a good car. Very good gas mileage on the I4 (27 mph) mixed driving. Fit and finish is excellent and beats Detroit models costing more. Holds the road like glue. Very responsive for a 4. Driver protection program beats the industry. Visibility is outstanding.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I never expected to buy this car. I had been looking since late summer and was all over the place. Matrix. PT, HHR, Fusion, vans, etc. Then suddenly this new car came out and I was amazed. It was like I designed it for me. It was a perfect compromise between everything I needed. My kids even said the back seat was roomier than our Buick. We did not get the 3rd row. I have the 4 cylinder and it's very peppy and quiet. Some 4's get pretty noisy but not here. My biggest concern is that it is brand new but the Kia warranty made that work for me. Plus we got the 2.9 interest and $1500 in rebates and the price at "invoice". Overall very pleased after a few weeks.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall look and feel of the car. The upgraded stereo is well worth it. I crank it up and it sounds great. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Only had it a short time. Bought it for my wife. Overall fit and finish is superb. Ride is excellent with good view to outside, roomy interior and a peppy V6. We take long trips on the highway about 6 times a year and this should be a perfect vehicle for those trips.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable, smooth ride, very responsive V6. Good versatility throughout.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We needed a vehicle that could carry our family of 4 easily yet have the option of more seats for the occasional in-law visit or the kid's friends. Minivans and SUVs were too big and we wanted the good gas mileage and all the safety features. The Rondo surprised us nicely. Not only was the interior better than what we expected, but the ride is actually fun! It's not a sportscar by any means but the ride is peppy and smooth and handling is great. Throw in all the standard features, great warranty and low price and you've got all that you'd want in a non-minivan.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the standard features (ABS, ESC, side curtain airbags), third row (adequate for children or small adults), peppy ride and great warranty.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the Rondo after several months of shopping. I compared it to Rav4, CR-V, Mazda5, and various other SUV/crossovers. I found the Rondo to be the best value for the price. The $750 cash assistance and special financing clinched the deal. When viewing from the outside, you cannot imagine how much room it has inside.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>After driving a minivan previously, this car is a lot of fun to drive. Plenty of power in the four cylinder, plus 26mpg over first 3 fill-ups!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Excellent combination of size and versatility. We have a family of 6 and wanted to carry all 4 kids if we needed to (other vehicle is a larger Pathfinder). Very surprised by the amount of shoulder room throughout the car. Fit and finish at this price range is excellent. Just got out of a minivan and really like the lower to the ground feeling of being in this car. Excellent visibility while driving. Just plain cute!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fit and finish. Manufacturer warranty. 3rd row seat. General comfort for a car this size.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Rondo in November, 2007. I had been looking at compact SUV's, wagons, etc. I had not found any vehicle that I liked the looks, storage space and price until I saw the Rondo. I fell in love immediately and bought it. No regrets. It is more comfortable, more economical and better driving than my 2004 Jeep Liberty.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the interior design and comfort.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a very well built vehicle. The first thing I noticed was the quality of the interior. It was completely above my expectations for a KIA. Very "touch friendly" and well laid out. The leg room in the 2nd row was probably the clincher. I cross-shopped the RAV4, CR-V, Pilot, Highlander, Equinox, CX-7, Santa Fe, Outlander and a couple of others. There was just no comparison. I also have the 7 seat model (which satisfied our need for 6+ seats), and even loaded it is very comfortable. The driving dynamics are also much better than expected. Great pickup on the v6, easy highway cruising, very commanding view of the road. We took a 900 mile trip the day after we took delivery. Grade: A+!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tactile interior materials are great! Sliding 2nd row, seating for 7, real 2nd row doors, easy entry to 3rd row, V6 power matched to 5 speed auto, seating height and ease of entry to driver's position, heated seats, steering wheel controls, lots of storage and cupholders.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is just what we needed! We are a retired younger couple who are on the go...but I need a 'lay-down' space for me in the back for long trips. We wanted a foreign car and the Kia Rondo is just perfect for us. It is zippy, comfortable, pretty inside and out and the 60/40 seating configuration is perfect for us 'empty-nesters'. The cost was within our price-range as well. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The overall looks, comfortable ride and interior design are great, but our favorite feature is the visibility! The windows are large and when you are driving OR a passenger, the views are great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I although I have only had the Rondo for a week I am completely satisfied with this vehicle. Having come from a 2006 Chev HHR, I was worried about giving up ride quality and low noise levels. I am glad to report that with the Rondo you do not have to sacrifice at all. The interior is quiet at highways speeds and the ride is wonderful...feels like a near luxury car and the handling is very competent. I would highly recommend this car to friends and family. So far the mpg has been in the mid 20's mixed highway and severe stop and go city traffic. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Build quality, upscale feel, interior room. I am 6'4" and over 400 and I easily fit in the driver's, passenger's and rear. 2.4 is smooth and responsive and quiet at highway speeds; 3000 rpm at 80.</FAVORITE>
