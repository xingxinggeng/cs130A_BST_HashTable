<TEXT>Driving experience is fun fun fun. The reliability is not so fun. There is a design flaw where it won't start in really cold temps. My sunroof won't open when its really hot. I have it in the shop twice to get lights replaced and two other times for minor issues. The seats are great for short trips since they hug you in the seat...but for long trips my lower back aches terribly. Also, the center console opens on its own by merely brushing it with my arm, needs a better closing mechanism. The sunroom screen doesn't block enough sun.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Between my husband and I we've owned a BMW product since 1986. The Mini is truly a BMW and comes with all the benefits and the drawbacks. BMW is all about what's under the hood - great engine, handling and braking. BMW really doesn't care if your drink fits in the cupholder of if the interior uses materials that makes it look worse than an econo box. After all, you're having too much fun driving to notice! If it's anything like our other BMWs, expect that each visit to the mechanic will be about $1,000 - it will happen enough to be painful but not enough to hate the car. Go to a Mini car club dinner (yes, you women too) to meet other owners and find out the best mechanics, body shop etc</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I have the Mellow Yellow with the yellow line interior. Mini has line interior kits if you want a change. Also there are lots of internet sites for all sorts of customization. One of the best features are other Mini owners. Join the Mini club for more driving fun!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Owned my Mini for a year and a half and it's been a real treat. NO problems. Even after 8 years people still crane to look at them, so don't buy one if you don't want to be noticed. Although it is admittedly a toy we have taken in on long trips to the beach in South Carolina and skiing in Vermont and it surprisingly accommodated my wife and I and all our gear. The little thing travels really well and seems the longer you are in the seats the better they get. I do wish they had put an opaque screen on the sunroof as the Virginia summers get boiling hot, but the auto down windows on the remote helps that some. Drinks in the cup holders tend to unintentionally turn on the seat heaters too. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Aux input for mp3 player, mood lighting, distinctive interior and exterior design (that's why we bought it), gas mileage, punch leather seats with seat heaters, quick warm up in winter. Panoramic sunroof is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Owned/driven my car for 15 months. Fun, but not reliable or well designed. Factory options only (no mods). Since owning, in for repairs SIX times (2x for turbo, 1x for audio amp, 1x for sunroof, 1x for tailpipe recall AND 1 week for replacing a factory built too-small transmission motor mount). My windshield has 3 stone chips and 2 big cracks due to stone hits & the high windshield angle. Engine has cold idle issue where it sounds like a diesel truck for 1-3 minutes. If you want a fun around-town car, are willing to overlook flaws/ major issues, can deal with repair trips to out-of-town dealerships (6 in 15 months), then buy this car. As for me, I'll be selling at the end of the warranty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Mini and will definitely get another. Amazing for zooming in and out on the highway, and also awesome for city driving. Our gas mileage is great- high 30's and sometimes even low 40's for pure highway driving. My husband and I are both very tall and find the cabin more than comfortable. I don't have any complaints about this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd MINI and I love them. I have done a ton of upgrades and this car zooms more then I thought it could. I bought mine loaded all the perks. Its been worth every dollar. I have won car shows with this car. If you get one I recommend an "S" can do more with it then a Cooper. Bite the bullet and buy the "S". This is not a car for fuel economy its to have fun and drive. If you get one make sure you wave Hi to other MINI's. Don't be rude show some MINI love. If you are getting it for fuel economy buy a Honda. These cars are meant to be family not just to have, but to have fun in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned in Nov-2007. Never required any service and computer shows that it needs have service after next 8000 miles for my current driving conditions. I had Mazda 6 before this car which was fun to drive but this is way more fun asking for more and more all the way up to turbo boost when I floor the gas pedal. Neither powerful nor fastest but it is quick, agile, solid and builds confidence even at high speeds on irregular pavements and curves never fails to give feedback to the driver. Premium gas is recommended but not required. Plenty of cheers/curious looks/hand waving/questions from others and other Mini owners is something I've seen with Mini Cooper only but not with any other car. </TEXT>

It uses less fuel than a trickling summer water ban water saver sprinkler! Driving it is arouses the limbic brain ( limbic brain is the primitve centre of the brain that makes you prick up your ears whe you are half a sleep and you here a noise in the house.) It awakens all your senses- and stimulates all those driving muscles and pleasure centres! Outdrives, out handles and out-happies every other car I have ever had!

<TEXT>The MINI is truely unique! One never gets tired of driving it. Gas mileage with premium is 35mph & steady. I've had the MINI for 9 months and its never been back to the dealer. I guess I got lucky? One problem I will discuss when I do go for my oil change is the cosmoline grease that runs down on parts of the car. Be sure to wipe it off as soon as you see it. Looks like runny vasoline. Will stain the rubber. But overall the Mini is super.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We fell in love with our Mini instantly and then almost immediately, the honeymoon was over. While being incredibly cute and fun to drive, we think spending over 45 days in the shop in 10 months is a bit much. We had work done on the AC, sunroof, flat tire indicator, replaced the catalytic converter, trouble with O2 sensors, and replaced the transmission not once, but twice! I'm thinking we got all of the problems that every other Mini owner didn't! Thankfully the dealer bought it back from us. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've driven this car in snow, on ice, across the country (1700 miles)) and back and forth to work. Love it. The car is roomy for one, tight for two passengers on a longer trip where both wish to have a drink in the holders at the same time. I usually have my cell phone in one of the cup holders which is handy. Cornering is fun, tight, no sway. No problem in traffic, visibility is great, power to get out of anyones way or away from traffic is supreme. I've got a roof rack on my MINI. I used it to maximize cargo capacity if I ever have the need, but be aware, there is wind noise with the rack but I've gotten used to it. Would buy again!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This little car is the most fun car I have ever owned. It is also the most fuel efficient vehicle I've ever owned. Combine it with practicality of a hatchback and you have the most perfect little car in the world. Get a 6 speed and you will have the most fun one can have in a car with clothes on. Even with aggressive driving, I still get better than 30 mpg city/hwy. If I am cruising on freeway, I get about 38 mpg. But with the traction control off I can burn the rubber anytime I want to! </TEXT>

<TEXT>It's wonderful! I have a 75 mile a day commute on a very winding road. This car makes the trip a lot of fun. It handles like a dream. I average 45 mpg, sometimes more, sometimes less depending on driving conditions, but I haven't gotten less than 41. The controls did take some getting used to, but that's just one more thing that makes this car unique. It is surprisingly roomy. I got a pretty basic model and it is still loaded with lots of nice features that most other cars only offer as "added features". I bought this car just as a work car that would be cheap on gas, but its so fun to drive that I drive it everywhere. My other vehicles are just collecting dust.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My MINI has NAV and all options. It reminds me of my 7 series except its smaller, more fun to drive, and it's never in the shop. Had a few quirks iPod installer screen getting stuck, but it resolved itself. Speaking of maintenance, I haven't needed any. Nothing. Nada. I have almost 12K miles on the car, and the coputer says it will be another year before it will need its first service. That said, we started shopping around for a larger vehicle because we're adding to our family, and the prices we're being quote for trade in are near ridiculous. $22K trade value in for a $34K car? Lease it, but don't buy it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car should win the Bang for the Buck contest. It is a performer that is easy on the gas. 0-60mph under 7 seconds and gets 30 mpg city/highway. There is no other car that can match the performance and the fuel efficiency of the new MINI Cooper S. But the engine makes loud noises like a diesel truck. On some occasions, it is worse as if it is grinding on some internal metal parts. Dealer has not found the solution yet. I have my fingers crossed that the MINI company will find a permanent cure for this problem. The car rattles sometimes. Handling is second to none.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this as my first ever new car. Within seconds of pushing the start button I was grinning ear to ear, and it hasn't stopped since. The fun factor of this car is off the charts. I have a feeling those who buy a Mini want a car that makes their heart race a little every time they sit in it. It drives and handles like a dream. I decided to go for the S package and get the better performance and pay more for that instead of paying for leather seats and an upgraded interior. I'm glad I did as the interior is already pretty nice in it's stock form. Overall it's a great car. There's ample room inside. In fact I can fit my skis inside instead of on the roof.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did a lot of homework on this car, selected what I wanted and have no regrets. The weather outside is not an issue with this car. (and this Chicago winter has been nonstop). Be sure to get the heated seats!) Mileage is good, handling is superb, and very precise. I have the upgraded radio and have rear dimming mirror, which are a must. xenon headlights are perfect for night driving. since you are going to purchase this car, go for the color and interiors that make you happy. Keep it clean, and it will remain looking brand new. Have had no problems for the 6 mos.

<TEXT>I've had this car for a few months now and love to drive it. The S has super powers. Cuts well in traffic. The car interior is not intuitive. The computer settings are odd, and it takes some time to get adjusted to how it all works. The HVAC controls are really bad but, that's all minor stuff. Overall not a great family car but wholly momma it makes for a great daily driver. I nearly look forward to the commute. I got the standard seats which seem comfortable, but sticky in warm weather. The summer might kill me. Actual gas mileage with normal 50/50 highway/street commute 29.5 mpg. I was hoping for a few higher. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Excellent car to drive, no need for the larger engine, especially with the 'boost' button provided. Corners nicely without additional sport suspension. Typical BMW ride, hard on the ground. Not a good car in snow. 6 speed transmission makes longer drives easy. Although small, it fits two adults and a full size cello in a hard case, but forget the back seat except for a dog rest.

<TEXT>I've enjoyed owning my 07 MCS more than my two previous MINIs. The ride in the S is much more comfortable now that the Sport Suspension is an option and not a standard (back-breaking) feature. But I have had some weird things happen with the factory- installed iPod adapter, and sometimes the NAV screen just blanks. The dealer can't find anything wrong with it. The run flats roar on the highway, but replacing them made the ride quieter. Visibility is an issue: other moron drivers have plowed into my lane on 4 occasions. Luckily I was able to avoid them, but it's still scary. Finally, this is definitely a single person car; any more than 2 people and it's a tight fit for stuff.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>NAV. It's fun and the geek in me loves the cool chimes it makes. Lounge leather is very comfortable, as are the heated seats. The fit and finish have been supurb, and the ordering process was very, very easy. Covered maintenance and high resale values don't hurt, either.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Mini is fun to drive and gets good gas mileage but it has two serious faults that would keep me from buying another Mini. First, the speedometer is off over 5 mph at 75 mph, the speedometer reads 80 mph when I am going 75 mph. I called Mini and they said that this was within design specs and they wouldn't and couldn't make the speedometer accurate. The other problem is with the road noise. It is difficult to talk on a cell phone at highway speeds. If they would fix these two issues and offer better customer service it would be a great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really enjoy driving this vehicle but there are some serious deficiency's that would prevent me from buying another Mini. The first is the road noise. Mini really needs to reduce the road noise, its so loud that at highway speeds its difficult to talk on my cell phone. Another significant problem is the speedometer, when I am going 75 mph the speedometer in the Mini reads 81 mph. I called Mini and they said that it is within design specs and they could not and would not fix the speedometer. This sloppiness in performance and the unwillingness of Mini to take care of the problem makes me wonder about Mini's integrity. I don't think it's too much to ask that the speedometer be accurate.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The normally aspirated Mini Cooper is a great deal of fun. While it lacks the punch of the Cooper S, it still has quite acceptable acceleration if you are in the appropriate RPM range. I happened to acquire one with the 6-speed auto transmission. If you include the sport mode, there are six different operational settings for the tranny, and there is a learning curve to figure them all out. I usually drive in manumatic/steptronic mode with the heavier steering of the sport mode enabled. The paddles on the steering wheel are especially convenient, and I do not miss a clutch pedal in heavy stop and go traffic. The wheels are on the corners, which makes for wickedly fun cornering!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got my car in June. I had a VW Beetle before so I'm used to a small car but Coop seems to be getting smaller everytime I get in. Leatherette seats make you sweat & the doors won't stay open. The cup holders are not usable, except the one in the back & the arm rest is in the way of that one. It drives fun when you go fast but in the city with stop & go traffic, it jumps a lot. Not sure if that's normal, but the dealership assures me that it is. It's been in the shop 2x since I've gotten it, the first time b/c my check engine light came on & I asked them to check the "jumpyness". They reset the computer & replaced recalled parts but then it became really jumpy & was smoking. Got it back today.</TEXT>

The dealer says the electronic control part is on "national order" status from Mini in Germany which leads me to believe that there must be a lot of other owners with the same problem. I'll have to wait and see if this car can outperform the Toyotas I have owned in the past. I also wish I had the leather seats - the "leatherette" plastic seats make you sweat like crazy and feel cheap relative to the cost of the car. Avoid them.</TEXT>

<TEXT>i've had my 2007 Mini Cooper S, Lazer Blue with Black roof and bonnet stripes. premium, sport and cold weather package, LSD, bluetooth and nav for about 3 weeks. Yeah that stuff adds a wee bit of weight but this car is by far the best car I have ever owned! I have a manual transmission and the throws are typical BMW throw length. Best fuel economy ever! I average 33.2mpg currently at 2240 miles. The ride could be rough for some, but I'm a sporty guy so it's perfect for highway passing and back roads. Trunk is small but perfect for if it's just two</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy, sport button, nav system is amazing and acurate (well worth the $2100) out slalom a Porsche, kick WRXs sideways, and own by far the most unique car on the market next to the Fiat 500 (which isn't avalible here in the us so MINI wins here ;) ) LSD gets rid of torque steer, trust me</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought in June brand new, third car only driven occassionally. Loved the car, so much fun to drive though handling is a bit rough. Yesterday, at 1171 miles, it began 'jumping'. I am no car expert and the best way to describe the problem is like when driving a stick and you dont change gears properly. Needless to say it will be going back to dealer as soon as we can get it there.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my BMW X3 for the Cooper S. I got so much more than fuel efficiency, which was my initial goal. I totally pimped it out! It is a joy to drive and it is solid! I was amazed at how well it is built and how solid it feels. BMW got it right! The turbo is quick, seamless and no turbo lag. The sound system is killer. The "bun warmer" seats are toasty on those chilly Colorado evenings when I like to drive with the "way cool" double moonroof opened to the max. The styling makes me smile when I drive it and others smile when I cruise by. It corners like a dream. My husband is 6'4" and loves this car. He has a brand new BMW 328XI and I can't get him to leave my MINI alone! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the car about 2 months ago and never had so much fun driving. I am taking long way to work and making detours! This car is both sporty and eco-friendly. The turbo provides wonderful torque in the twisties yet is economical to drive on the highway in 6th. As some teenagers that walked by my house put it, 'This is a sick ride man !'.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turbo engine and great handling in on top of the list. Very convenient also with hatch and folding seat feature. Try loading as much stuff in a Miata !</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Every morning I look forward to driving my Cooper S. The turbo engine's relatively smooth and eager to rev. With a pretty tight suspension on the car, it seems to swallow most corners with ease. The small exterior dimensions hide a surprisingly roomy interior. I've transported 4 adults in my car without complaint. Fold down rear seats also make the car pretty good at transporting groceries/gear from Costco. Finally, the car nets an astounding 35 mpg for me on the freeway and I get about 30 mpg combined. FWD robs the car of fun though. Until I start a family, the Cooper will meet my needs - small, fun, economical, zippy and easy to maneuver in any environment - it's a perfect urban car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned my Mini for three months now. It gets a lot of attention and questions from curious people. People even roll down their windows and ask questions when I'm sitting in traffic. Can't believe how smooth and fast the car accelerates. Torque steer on this car can be a little scary if you punch it hard. Very comfy for two people. Great on gas, averaging 32 MPG with combined city/highway and can go almost 400 miles on one tank. Had a Murano try to follow me through the twisty bits a couple weeks ago. That was funny. The ride can be a little harsh over bumps and is probably not for everyone. Probably the most irritating thing about this car is having traffic in front of you. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration. Seats are classy and cradle driver. Great gas mileage without having to give up performance. Nice quality interior. Good looking exterior. Handles well. No turbo-lag...six speed is easy to drive. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have one year lease on a basic Mini. I got Minnie my Mini 6 weeks ago off the lot, so it came with features I would not have ordered, or known I wanted or needed- but now love. But worrying: From day 3 check engine light came on intermittently-gas cap issues, it seems- then went away. It went on again yesterday (1100 miles) when tank got low so that was ok. But it's fun to drive and I'm not even into cars (I thought.) It's like a go cart but feels super safe and you don't feel small. It is tight if you're on a long trip trying to stuff lots of stuff in the car but with one person you can do it, 2 may be tougher. But I love her! And gets lots of compliments!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the auto-dim rearview mirror and auto headlights. Nevere would have ordered, but they make life zillion times easier. Love the bluetooth-- don't have advanced pricey option where it recharges but basic setup is awesome. You talk out loud, hear thru stereo speakers. Love comfort access.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Everything about this car is thought out and designed to perfection. The fit and finish is superior. When the turbo kicks in, it flies. I wanted to get a Solstice but was disappointed with its poor visibility and interior quality. For less money I got the Mini and have not regretted it. It handles just like a go cart, has good visability, feels safe, and the interior is beautiful. The electronic displays are all programmable, including allowing you to call up a speedo in the center of the tach (infront of the wheel). In addition the car keys have memory built in them and remember your personal settings. Absolutly amazing. You won't understand until you drive one.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Dissappointed</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>This is not going to be your normal review since, though I've owned this car for just 2 months now, I've actually only had it in my possession for half a day and have only driven it 15 miles. Why? Because it keeps having problems which the dealer either can't identify or fix, and which Mini seems to care nothing about since they seem to have a problem sending parts to repair what they find wrong. My ratings are based on the 15 miles I drove the car. The problems seem to have started when they forgot to remove the gas tank vent plugs on arrival. But after replacement of the entire fuel system it's still having problems. Yes, it's a lemon and in frustration I've asked for my money back.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a really fun car to drive and turns a lot of heads. Performance is exceptional with the MINI mania HP upgrades. Borla exhaust is a little loud on extended trips. A few body fit problems noted and as yet dealer has not been able to fix. A couple of quality issues that you would not expect on a BMW product. One of the key remotes did not work-had to be replaced by dealer. Line to boost gauge pulled loose triggering all kinds of engine warnings. The car is fully loaded with all options so lots of fun things to play with. Performance and looks are real highpoints. Electric top has a few quirks but generally works very well. This is a fun ride!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dealer added performance options make this car a real screamer. Can keep up with most of the muscle cars and beat them on the curves! Electronics are fun to play with! Convertible is the only way to go with this vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I waited for the '07 since I liked the design details and 6 speed as a standard on the base MINI. Fun doesn't even begin to explain the driving experience. It seems it calls me when it is parked in the garage or in the work parking lot. Didn't feel I needed the MINI Cooper S and I am perfectly fine with the base MINI. I have been averaging 28 MPG (city driving only) since I have yet to have him (MINI MAC) out on the open road. Oh yes, you will name him or her since it becomes so personalized and full of character. MINI MAC loves the curves and getting the attention he deserves on and of the road. Good gas mileage, lots of newer technology built in, and loads of fun.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Personalization - you chose the colors in and out, options options options. You make it your own. And of course the fun to drive. I continue to find new features that I did not know existed. Nice sunroof, the sport seats mold to your bod, comfortable room for two kids in back seat and golfclubs.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is a must have. Driving with this car is so much fun, especially with the top down. It feels and drives like a sports car. Driving over backroads let you think whether you ever want to stop driving, or as I said to my wife, 'Once Mini ... Mini forever'. Everything in this car is made for fun. And for a convertible of its size, you can still transport 4 people or load the back of the car easily because the seats fold flat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've almost reached the break in mileage so I have not really pushed the car to its limits as yet. But it has great handling in all areas, a lot of grunt for a 1600 cc car, and good mileage. I like the jumbo speedo. The unusual placement of controls that receives lots of complaints isn't a problem for an owner. If you drive the car frequently the control placement becames natural. For my needs it is almost perfect. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've got a minimally optioned Cooper S (LSD, HID lights, arm rest, 16" wheels, no sport suspension). The handling of the car is very good. It reminds me of an MR-2 I used to have and is much more responsive than the WRX I traded for it. It's just plain fun to drive. Torque steer and the LSD can conspire to twist the wheel a little - use two hands. Power from the 1.6 turbo motor is very nice - not as fast as the WRX I traded (Cobb stg 3), but very useable low end torque and nicely spaced ratios in the manual 6 speed trans.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The new '07 Mini is much improved over the last one. Just got one of the first six speed manuals. The car drives great and has significantly more performace than the previous base model. Performance could be better, but then they wouldn't have a reason to charge more for the S. Overall, the car is a joy. The sport seats are comfortable, easy and specific configuration options enables you to get exactly what you want. The car gets a great deal of attention and is just plain fun. I would highly reccomend this car to those who want something different and individual.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Went and bought a 2007 turbo S model. It's a fun car to drive. Bought it for the gas mileage, and I am not dissappointed. Turbo performance is awesome. Just have to get used to a smaller vehicle. Only problem so far is cd player doesn't work. At some point I'll have to take it in, but it's a 130 mile drive to get there.

<TEXT>I first drove a Mini in 1966 and I never forgot it. When the 2007 model came out I decided to buy one. Everything about the car is great: a bicycle fits in the back, it gets great gas mileage, and the overall feel of the car is exceptional. Except...the engine malfunction light came on at 340 miles and it has been in the shop ever since. Mini U.S. and Mini Germany have no idea how to fix it at this point. I am told that it has been joined by another 2007 with the same problem at 380 miles. I would suggest that you avoid buying a 2007 at this point and give them time to work out the bugs if you feel you must have this car.</TEXT>
