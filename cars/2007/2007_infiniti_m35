<TEXT>I got my M35X only because I am 6 foot 2 inch tall and it seemed to be roomy from inside and after driving it for few thousands miles I noted that the engine is very noisy with annoying riddling noise, took it to the dealer and they changed the intake, did solve the problem, changed the exhaust did not solve the problem, so finally they called it a character of the cars and I have to accept that, I will try to trade it for any other car. So my advice is to stay away from any Infiniti. I don't recommend it at all. Be smart and pay a little more and get a better car to enjoy not to spend a lot of time in the dealership or over the phone to work on the car. It is bad bad bad quality cars.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had no interest in this car, looked at it merely to appease my husband. Thought it was too big but after sitting in it, I decided I had to test drive it. After test driving it, I was sold. Nearly 2 years later I am still mostly pleased. I find the exterior design a little boring and sometimes feel it looks like an over-priced, glorified Nissan. Interior is beautiful, very comfortable and roomy. ISSUES: All my wood-panel veneers (on doors) popped off, had to be replaced. Have trouble with programmed seats (using key), begins adjusting as programmed then just stops. Always had a noticeable miss/hesitation at @ 38 mph, dealer says nothing is wrong.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Only had the car 2 months. Cert Pre- Owned with 6400 miles. Questioned the low mileage as feasible but all appears in order. Dealer repolished all 4 scraped rims, fixed driver door actuator and rear door plate. Took almost two weeks but satisfied now. Had a Volvo prior (174K) which had made me antsy about the high rpm revving (3-4K) of this vehicle (normal?) when going stop to say 25-30 mph. Other than the above, satisfied with the car, radio, gps, a/c, etc... Knew mileage would be low going in. Will see how things go as time and miles build up. Have put 2K miles in the 8 wks I have had the car. Have put the Volvo out of mind weeks ago, hopefully will last as long... time wise...</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roominess for my frame (6'3"/210lb) and I like the width of the interior. Originally looked at the G35/37, but after driving the G37x as a loaner for almost two wks, glad I got the M35. G37 was much narrower. Extra features like bluetooth comes in handy especially when you're passing the police.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Car brings everything it has promised, 2 and a half years later. The performance is outstanding. I have had no problems whatsoever with this vehicle. The car accelerates with ease, handles beautifully at high and low speeds and is one of the most enjoyable vehicles I have ever driven. The ESC and lane departure features keep you safer and I love the GPS. Bought my son a Garmin for his car, and still think mine is better. I love the Bluetooth! I can hear everyone and they hear me. Easy to answer, easy to call and again makes the vehicle safer with the hands off. I would buy this car again and recommend it without hesitation.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had an 05 G and bought the M without ever driving one. Friend had one and loved it. No regrets. Don't see the M very often and I like that. Do wish in town was better than 18-19 but I get over 28 at 70mph. Radio reviews were concerning and does a very good job - have Sirius. Great for highway travel and have had no issues or ever used the warranty. Same with the G.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bluetooth failure froze console. Nissan, at first refused warranty repair saying my ATT8525 was not on their list. But Bluetooth is a trademark that requires interoperability. Finally they agreed to repair it. This took 4 tries. Then my AC condenser was pierced by a stone. They refused warranty repair because "stone chips" are excluded. This is understandable for paint not for an internal part they should protect with grill work. That's a design defect. Their voice recognition for phone numbers is awful. The gas mileage is lower than a good design could have made it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car reviewed well and was available used at a good price. On brief test drive it seemed like a BMW 5 series clone and we bought it, anticipating a BMW like car with better reliability. It pleased for a while, but eventually began to feel like a big washy boat when being driven. We also noticed the price we pay for the exceptional headroom inside is a high roof and less front visibility over the hood. This is a good car but I am still paying for it and my wife has already lost her fascination with it. A BMW it ain't, in spite of reviews comparing them. Now I don't know what to aspire to, since BMW has been producing a technically clunky car lately that doesn't crash test well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>UPDATE: Back in March of this year I wrote a review of our M35 AWD and complained about, among other things, the poor gas mileage. In all fairness I need to report that somewhere around 9K miles the mileage improved. I now get a solid 21 mpg of mixed driving and 22.5 mpg highway. This is with premium fuel and driving driven conservatively. I still blame the AWD for a 2 mpg loss and would encourage new car buyers to press their dealer for rear wheel drive cars. With modern traction control, there is very little real world benefit to AWD. And given the obvious need to conserve fuel, AWD just can?t be justified, in my humble opinion. The nature of this car makes it tiring to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The multi-panel which houses the audio, climate and navigation (if equipped) is about as easy to use as they come, though that's not saying much. It's unfortunate that nav complicates listening to the radio or adjusting the temperature. Most of the aforementioned can be controlled by voice commands </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Coming from a G35 the M35 is not nearly as peppy. The M feels like a luxo boat taking off. Would prefer the 330HP G37 engine. Besides that, I love the room as I am 6'5''. The M needs another gear (although it looks like the 7 speed will be out soon). The user interface is easy to use. The fit and finish are excellent and love the wood. The other reason I got the M was because of the heating/cooling seats, works ok, was expecting little. The steering is not as tight as the G which is a slight disappointment.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The screen - user interface. The voice command. Air circulation is great. keyless start. fit and finish. Heating and cooling on the seats. Steering wheel mounted controls. Really comfy for us taller people. Really nice ride for long distances.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchase based in part on Consumer Reports review. Considered BMW 535 and MB E-350. No defects to date. Outstanding GPS user interface to all electronic functions. So intuitive no need to read the manual. Laser speed control is absolutely wonderful and works perfectly in all kinds of traffic. Front seats are perfect for 6 footer. Handles like you're riding on rails. Excellent self centering of steering on the highway. Excellent acceleration. 21 MPG. Stereo a bit weak in highs. Road noise need reduction. Brakes are perfect. Add a sixth gear and reduce the RPM (gear ratio) in top gear on highway. Love the rear view camera, exc fit and finish, beautiful design. Would buy again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a follow-up from a previous review in which I described a major engine problem at 5,000 miles. The selling dealership had to repair a faulty main bearing which they claimed was a factory defect. The problem surfaced after a 5,000 mile road trip. At 9,500 miles I began another long road trip. After arriving in Sacramento on Day 1, smoke was coming from the engine compartment. Fortunately there was a dealership nearby. They had to replace a blown transmission seal. In both instances, the dealerships were very good about repairing the problem, but I have lost confidence in being able to go out of town. My question to Infiniti is, do you occasionally grow lemons in all colors?</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a brand new 2007 M35 that had been hanging around the dealer's lot for a while. Not sure why. Perhaps the color, Crimson Roulette. Whatever, it is a great car with every feature I could want (and some I didn't know I wanted or needed). The car came equipped with both the technology and advanced technology package. The surround sound system is OK, the navi is very good, and the overall comfort level is excellent. The ride and the handling is great and loads of fun when taking on the Napa Valley mountain curves. Overall, a great buying experience and a great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a used 07 M35x 2 weeks ago after an exhaustive search. The highs are interior, front seat room (lots of headroom for me 6'6" - better than SUVs!!). Fun to drive - tight. Looks great with the possible improvement being the rear. Things to improve. Nav: my garmin is much better. Bluetooth doesn't understand any voice commands (Go Home = Call Mom). I get 21 mpg not great but knew that going in. What makes this car very desirable is 60k mile warranty, tops in reliability and Consumer Reports rating the unchanged 08 model as 2nd only to the LS 460. Bought mine for $31.5k with 19k miles. Couldnt be happier. Using regular gas with no knocking. Tight handling/low clearance.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design and room - very nice, backup camera is great. So far I'm very happy with the car. It is the value leader. I'm 6'6 with a long torso and I have LOTS of headroom and legroom.

<TEXT>What a fun car to drive I have a big smile on my face when driving my M35. We have tested the X3, Volvo S80, MDX, Avalon, GS 350 and the M35 was the best bang for the buck, roomier then most others in the same class. It seems like that most carmakers make the cars smaller and smaller hope that Infiniti stays with their roomier layout I love the Lexus GS but it is too small for me. I am getting AVG of 20.6 mpg will try manual shifting see if I get a better mileage. I tinted the windows and it looks so cool, this car rocks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The M is beautiful at rest. The interior is wonderfully lighted at night. Automotive art. Start it though, and you?d be happier in a Toyota pickup truck. The M is jittery over any road not glass smooth. Steering requires a lot of attention and correction. The nearly constant drone of the engine is unnecessary, distracting and unwelcome. Until you get used to it, you may find yourself double checking your blind spots looking for what must surely be a motorcycle nearby. Barely 20mpg of premium fuel for mostly highway driving driven conservatively. I fault the AWD for at least 2 mpg of that. Anyway, I should have kept my 1999 Lexus GS. Oh, that?s right, I did. Thank goodness. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased a black M35 with Journey package 10 months ago after looking at Lexus, BMW, MB and Acura. M35 is the best car for the money. Fun to drive. Exterior styling while not "special" still gets a lot of looks. Sneaks up to 85 mph+ with no effort (feels like driving 70 mph). There is an annoying high frequency rattle in the display screen area while traveling on a rough highway such as Texas' "chip and seal" surface. The dealer has not been able to correct the rattle without tearing down the dashboard. Otherwise the car has been fantastic during its first 13,000 miles. Mileage has been low as expected (~18 mpg city, ~24 mpg highway).</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the second rating I've made on my 2007 M 35. With 5000 miles the engine was making funny noises. The dealer had to bring in some experts who diagnosed a failure of the lower bearings. The engine was torn apart and they rebuilt the bottom end. The dealer said is was about a $5000 repair, covered under warranty, of course. The service manager suspected it was a factory defect and checking their computer database, there have been about 10 similar problems throughout the US. The dealer was good to work with. They took my initial concerns seriously and didn't try to kiss it off. They provided a G35 loaner. The car now has 8000 miles and there have been no further problems. </TEXT>

Best car for the money considering std. and opt. features, driving experience (acceleration, steering, braking), ride, interior and exterior aesthetic design, egonometric design, functionality and legiblity of controls and operating costs. Next best car is MB E350 4M, but $12k more similiarly equipped. Disappointed with gas mileage - 16 city/24 highway (with cruise control) and non-aggressive driving.

<TEXT>Purchased an M35 with the Journey and Tech packages in early September. Just hit 1500 miles. This is a fun car to drive. The gas mileage is horrible (worse than some SUVs). Sticker said 18 mpg in city, even with very gentle driving I only get 15 or 16 mpg. Road noise and engine noise are a little more than I expected but not bad. Could use an extra gear. If you step on it to pass at 65 mpg, you're not really going to go anywhere fast.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car feels like it was designed to impress car testers rather than real world driving. I traded from a 10 year old BMW 540i and would take the old car back in a minute. The V8 BMW got 20% better gas mileage and rode better. The M handles better than the BMW but at the cost of a very harsh ride, loud tire noise and VERY twitchy steering. The car has no "on center" feel and you have to constantly apply steering input to keep it going straight which is very tiring after an hour of driving. Considering the price, I can live with everything but the steering. Make sure you take a long drive on the freeway before buying. Otherwise a great car $10000 cheaper than the competition.</TEXT>

<TEXT>M35 for 22 months: Pearl with tan interior (looks larger than the darker ones). Get a bra. Still feels new. Can't wait to drive it every morning. Wax it once a week. Better at high speeds - 100 MPH sneaks up on you. Plenty of HP - makes you want to do things you shouldn't. Mileage better than expected: 20 MPG around town (40% fwy 60% surface streets); 26 MPG averaging 79 MPH Chino to Vegas or Fresno. Really fun on Interstate 15 past Barstow. E350 , 525i RL and A6 were the other choices. Glad I got the M35. What would I add? 6th gear for the highway Automatically locking/unlocking doors.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fun car to drive. Excellent acceleration. Transmission crisp. Car handles very well for an AWD car. Battery was dead 2 hours after delivery. Incredibly, seat climate control fan does not turn off when the car engine is shut down. The fan drained the battery. This is an incomprehensible flaw. Floor width for feet is too narrow for big feet. Nav is easy to use, but typical of these systems, it is rife with errors on street names. It even has the wrong designation for a local interstate highway. It has mislocated the car off the road twice so far. These systems still have a long way to go. Car should be quieter. Mileage okay so far. Flaws do not distract from an otherwise excellent car. Enjoy car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Backup camera is excellent! Infiniti controller is better than German competitors. 10 way seats. Excellent headlights. Nice dash lighting. Steering wheel controls easy to use.

<TEXT>I tried very hard to replace my G35 with a german automobile (bmw, mb, audi) but I just could not do it. (That 3 series turbo is really sweet.) Infiniti is doing as good a job for a much better price. Why pay more for equivalent product? M35 is a sharp looking car with a sweet engine, a nice ride and a beautiful interior. The Rosewood with graphite leather is impressive to behold. Gas mileage is not really good. Plenty of room throughout, unless you are a very big person you should find this car's size suitable. If you desire a really nice car for a fair market price (they are in business to make a profit after all) then look at an M35.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just purchased an M35x with AWD. So far we are satisfied with this car. It's fun to drive, the engine is extremely powerful, and it's very comfortable. Compared to other sedans in its class the M is probably the best value for your dollar. It has a high resale value (not that we want to get rid of it) and it's got all the features that the competitors offer for a much better price. So far the only complaint with this car is the gas mileage. But that was to be expected and so it doesn't come as a shock. So overall I would say that this is a great car. We already have one SUV so a sedan with AWD is just what we needed. </TEXT>

Great road car, very comfortable and solid performance. Averaged 24.2 mpg which is better than expected, averaging 56 mph (lots of 80 mph cruising). I'm 6'3" and 250 lbs, and there is plenty of room.

<TEXT>I drove all the competitors. It came down to three: Lexus GS 350, MB E-Class and the M35. After driving all of them back to back several times, in different conditions and roads, I liked a fully loaded M35 the best and it started out in 3rd place. As I spent more time with each, the strong and weak points became more apparent. As I became more familar with each car the following is what made the M stand out. Size and comfort of seats. Flexibility of driver positions, due to more head room. More backseat legroom. User friendly instrument panel. It is fun and a pleasure to drive. Also see below. A trip to L.A from S.F. gave 23 mpg round trip w/ mixed driving. One way 24 mpg @ 75mph.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just leased 2007 M35 With Advanced Tech Package. I love the car for pretty much everything, except for few things. Extremely poor gas mileage. My commute consist of about 3.5 miles of local driving and 21 miles of freeway driving. I noted that I am only getting 17 miles per gallon. Perhaps my aggressive driving contributes to this factor. But my Maxima with VQ35DE engine (same 3.5 Litter engine at M35) which has 20 less horse power gets about 23.5 miles average miles. I hope Infiniti will improve gear ratio or maybe add extra gear or gears to save GAS.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks on this car are simply flawless. I feel like everyone is looking at me, especially with stock aero body kit. Interior is great, everyone who has been in my car thinks that this car cost well over $80,000 when in reality it goes for around $50,000. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I moved up from a 2004 Infiniti I30 to the 2007 M35. The M35 is more fun, much more powerful, and has great features like the voice commands and bluetooth. But it is a bear when it comes to gas consumption. It gets only 18 miles per gallon on the highway and 15 mpg in the city. The bluetooth often disengages even though used with a recommended cellphone. Conclusion: I should have bought the I30 that I was leasing which had only 13,000 miles at the end of a 39 month lease!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I read a lot of reviews and test drove this car twice, along with the BMW 540i, Audi A4, Acura TSX, and Lexus GS350. This is by far my favorite of all of them. It is just as fun to drive, handles great, but has the benefit of an amazing interior design. The navigation is by far the best I've ever seen in any car, voice controls work well, and it has a very easy to use interface. I would recommend this car to anyone who is willing to spend the money for a luxury sports sedan. Bravo Infiniti for producing yet another great vehicle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I used to have an '04 530I. I really like the M tho. Looks great! Interior is awesome. Plenty of room. Gas mileage is horrendous. Averaging 17-18 mpg. Engine performance over 75mph is poor. It should have 6 gears. If you floor it at 75mph or higher, you'll go nowhere. But the M is still a sexy beast. It lacks some of the finer BMW features and sportiness. Couple of cheap interior parts. Stereo is pretty bad in base package. Expected more from $40k car. Nonetheless I'm happy with my purchase. Voice recog is pretty cool. Bluetooth is just average.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Tested several cars before buying this one. (Cadillac DS, BMW 530, Lexus ES350, Lincoln Zephyr, Mercedes E) This is a great highway cruiser. I arrive without the usual aches after a long drive (>300 miles). Only car that came close to this one was the BMW 530 which was a bit more comfortable with slightly better handling. However, it was $10,000 more and didn't have all the bells and whistles like the heated/cooled front seats. Also don't understand why Germans keep putting their cruise control on an awkward stalk rather than the steering wheel and use those flimsy cup holders. Can't understand why American producers don't get the message. Cadillac and Lincoln couldn't even come close.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Driving Experience disappoints, primarily as a result of local dealers poor customer response. The tranny &/or torque converter pulsation at 36- 38 MPH is irritating, denied by the new car sales mgr at dealer (Why do you drive 38 MPH? Where's that speed limit?) yet 1st service visit, advisor comments as "an unfortunate spec" that he's heard of often. Very foul odor, when car is parked for 2-3 days, thru ventilation system. The stereo sound quality is not as good as vehicles with half the price and that's with the '07 Tech II package. Overall, the brand and the product is overmarketed and the treatment by the dealership employees is one of arrogance vs listening, recording and addressing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you are looking for an AWD luxury sport sedan in the 45-50k range, look no further than the Infiniti M35x! Previously drove an Audi A6 2.7t and this car blows it out of the water in terms of looks, performance, features, standard equipment...everything. Was also considering the Lexus GS 350 awd..both comparably priced with similar features. Depends on what you want in a car...if you want more sportier characteristics def go with the M35x. Don't even bother with the BMW 530ix! Even the G35 is roomier inside than the BMW. Exterior styling on the M35x could, however, be a bit more daring...bit too conservative to make it stand out in a crowd.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is awesome. I had 2 Nissan Maximas before, and loved the car, but got tired of Front-Wheel Drive. This car has the performance of Rear-Wheel Drive and when you need it, All- Wheel. The tech toys are awesome. The car came with the Technology package with Sirius radio. I didn't think it was necessary for the Cruise control, Lane Departure system or the DVD player (I would've liked the 5.1 Surround, but not that big of a deal considering the package is $3300). The bluetooth system is way better than the Maximas, and the voice recognition is pretty accurate, although when calling, its not that great, but whatever.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Uses a modified version of the platform in the 350Z and the G35 and shares some of their sporty and rough-around-the- edges "muscle-car" characteristics, while also overlapping some with German premium brands -- but without matching their finesse, quiet smoothness, and "aristocratic" style. You only get a five (not 6) speed manually shift-able automatic transmission, so highway mileage suffers; but, this car is all about fast acceleration, not about finesse or keeping mpg over 20. Inside, it has many of the upscale electronics you'd expect from Japan, yet includes a lot of the old-fashioned buttons too which I found tedious but some might like as familiar.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car, fully up-to-date with all the right gadgets. Love the dashboard. The kids love the rear entertainment. Bose sound system is quite amazing for a car, especially with the dvd-audio discs. It (read: the V6) is a bit noisy when on full trottle, but very quick accelleration in return. Battery drained twice, one time when I left the car lights on, the other when I somehow did not close it properly in my garage. All in all a very decent car. As a European I wouldn't say its 100% up to the built quality of Audi/BMW/Mercedes, however it makes up in being fully loaded at $55k. Fuel economy is fairly poor, but at $2.5 0/gallon its ok (vs $8/gallon in Europe). Highly recommended.</TEXT>
