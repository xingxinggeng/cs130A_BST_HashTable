<TEXT>In the past I have owned multiple BMWs, Lexus, Accura, Infinities, and other Mercedes models and this is by far the best of the best. The car is extremely stylish, has incredible power, great handling and is just all around fun to drive. There are some sacrifices in rear head room for style but I gladly accept those sacrifices (not like I am back there anyway). This vehicle takes the stuffiness out of the larger luxury sedans and adds style and class that may not be for everyone. Suits me perfectly. The console controls are more intuitive than others (iDrive) and the packages offered combine a good set of features. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling can not be beat at this price point (inside and out). Exhilarating to drive. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the car in Aug of 07. I bought the car as a weekend car and pretty much only drive it on the weekends. the car is very powerful and very fun to drive. The tranny is a little jerky at low speeds. The exhuast note is lovely and the looks of the cars is stunning. I have had both women and men tell me the car is sexy. The car is definitely an eye turner and the stop light to stop light power is heart pumping! This car will get you into trouble real quick! I hope you enjoy it if you decide to buy!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The low stance that it gives. the lines of the car make it the most sexiest MB they made in my eyes.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned 10 vehicles over the last 25 years and the CLS550 is unquestionably the biggest disappointment. Bottom line - I've got an $80,000+ luxury vehicle with all the bells and whistles that drives like a 1972 Fiat. Despite being in the shop 3 times in the first 90 days, the vehicle continues to violently rattle and vibrate, the "premium sound system" sounds like a transistor radio, and the "climate controlled seats" are nothing more than a weak fan with an imperceptable effect. Two thumbs down!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The CLS is the most stylish 4 door sedan ever! But extremely not user- friendly. Navigation entry relies on arrow keys and enter button to choose words from list instead of touchscreen keypad. It is maddening! I find myself avoiding using it. Headlight control/indicator placed too low and out of sight. When in full on position, it does not turn off automatically when engine is shut off. Center console storage too small. No coin holder. Door pockets blocked by seats. Wiper control on turn signal lever requires twisting instead of simpler up/down motion. No rear view camera available. I am very disappointed by my first Mercedes. I will not buy another Mercedes again.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling, power, smoothness, handling, build quality. I drive quickly, but find no use for all that power on speed limited roads. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently purchased the CLS550 Iridium Silver / Blk interior / AMG package. This car is an absolute blast to drive! There is plenty of torque in the sport mode and not sure where anyone could benefit from the 507 HP engine. I?ve owned it just 2 weeks and have 2 speeding tickets to show for it? performance is just intoxicating. The car has a stunning exterior style and resembles nothing else on the road.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great balance between speed/sports car and luxury. Wicked fast when you want it. Super soft for cruising (highway driving is great - not like a big sedan but much smoother than similar speed sports cars). Four adults OK but a little tight. Great choice for sports car with the occational need for four adults.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just took possession of my 2007 Iridium Grey on black leather CLS550. The combination of power, comfort and style surpass any vehicle out there. If you're looking for a family sedan, this is not the car for you. But if you like the appearance and performance of a coupe with the pragmatism of a 4-door sedan, you are in for a pleasant susprise. The 7-speed automatic is perfectly matched to the new 5.5 Liter V8, with perfect compromise between fuel economy and performance. At the same time, with ADS, one can ride in comfort without the harshness of an overly firm sport suspension </TEXT>

<TEXT>Really hard to find any faults in this car. Torque and power will surpass just about anything out there. Ordered mine with every option including AMG package. Really finishes off the car. Includes paddle shifters, AMG exhaust, and AMG styled aprons and trim. Put it in Sport 2, turn off the traction control, and put it in manual mode. That's when you can really see what this car is all about. 18 inch staggered wheels really grip the road and corner effortlessly. MB really has outdone themselves with this years CLS. Can only imagine the power of the CLS63. But this one has plenty! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I went in the dealership planning to trade in my MB for the E350 until I spotted the CLS550 in the showroom. I didn't bother checking out the E350. I'm so happy I got the CLS550. The car handles the road very well. Everyone stares at the car when you're on the road. It's a beauty! It's sporty and classy at the same time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 31st Mercedes and I think it may well be the best. I did not bother with the AMG because the power is simply awesome without the 507 hp engine. The 382 suits me fine. Rarely do I use the back seat so I have no comment on its comfort level, but I love the styling and feel of the car. I have owned most models of MB during the years and have always craved the sportiness of the SL and the comfort of the S. Here I have what I have always wanted. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It is difficult for me to describe just how brilliant the CLS 63 AMG is. It really is a dream car. It simply does everything! When you are stressed, tired or off to lets say the ball, it will simply drive like a very comfortable and expensive saloon. However, should you need to get somewhere quickly, its speed will leave you breathless and with a big smile on you face! It will get you from 0-60mph in 4.1 seconds if you use the paddle shifts or 4.3 if you leave it in sport mode. Only very serious supercars like a Lambo are faster. I spent about 8 months researching the CLS range and decided there was nothing out there with this combination of beauty, style, performance, and practicality.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Took delivery of this beauty in Stuttgart. The Euro Delivery Program is highly recommended and will save you major bucks. Plus Mercedes really does a great job taking care of you. For those of you who need a 4-door but want a sports car, there isn't anything that comes close to this car. It flies and feels like it's on rails through corners. When the governor maxed out on the Autobahn at 130 mph, it still felt effortless to drive. Check it out, you won't go wrong with this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>CLS 550 is truly a fun car to drive. Airmatic DC (air suspension), by all means is the best. The ride is smooth and sporty at the same time. Airmatic will automatically lower the suspension at highway speeds to improve the aerodynamics of the vehicle. CLS has a very powerful engine, enough power for most people. I can only wonder what the 63 & 65 (AMG) has to offer in terms of power. The car is so unique in terms of its exterior styling, there is nothing like it on the road. The audio, Harmon Kardon/ Logic 7, has exceptional sound quality. CLS is a beauty with the beast inside. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Airmatic DC with ADS II hands free communication. Keyless Go. Heated and active ventilated front seats. Bi-Xenon headlamps with active curve illumination. 382 hp/391 lb-ft. It's fast!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted to buy my dream car, a special car that I would love to drive for a few years and would still be great looking. I researched the web extensively, test drove more cars than I ever did before, and decided on the CLS, with the AMG package. When I first saw it, it made my heart skip a beat! I have driven 3 Cadillac STSs, a SAAB 900 turbo, went conservative with a Volvo S80 twin turbo, but this car is special. I love power and good looks and this car is awesome. I can't drive it without a smile coming to my face.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It is about time that this beautiful sedan has the performance to match its racy looks. For the past year I had been wanting a CLS but found it performance to weak for a sedan of this class. However, when I heard that for '07 MB was putting a larger engine with 80 more hp in, it sealed my decision. This car is perfect and get so many looks while crusing down the road. The interior is beautifully appointed. I am very pleased.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In terms of styling, I have never been a fan of MB. This CLS 550 has changed my perception. This great looking vehicle shines like a star among others whether they are MB or its competition. Interior layout and quality are classy and luxurious with the excpetion of the cup holders which interferes with the shift stick. The new 382 horsepower V8 engine is world class and more responsive than the '06 model. Power is instantly available when needed. The drive is silky smooth. Back seats are surprisingly spacious considering this is a coupe with 2 extra doors added. Definitely 1 of the best German automobiles available currently.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I ordered the CLS550 for my wife and waited 3 months for delivery from Germany. It is beyond our wildest dreams. The new 380 horse power engine and new computerized hydraulic brakes are just what it needed. I have owned many cars but nothing combines looks and performance like this. I am puzzled why so many people bought the old CLS500 with only 302 horse power, and electric brakes. I am glad we waited for the new 550!</TEXT>
