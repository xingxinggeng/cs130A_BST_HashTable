<TEXT>This car is almost 3 years old and since the beginning I have told the dealer it slides when braking and taking off on wet roads - badly. They always have said nothing is wrong. Now they tell me it must be the tires and I should spend $600.00 on different tires, to my reply was so you sold me a car with unsafe tires. I got a shrug of shoulder response. This coupled with horrible rear and rear sides visibility due to huge v shaped metal between rear and side windows and non-movable headrests make it an unsafe vehicle. I will not even take it on a trip or out if it is raining or about to rain. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Within the first week of owning, failed computer module cause unsafe driving conditions and faulty triggering of my tcs/abs on the highway.? car would slow down, not accelerate.. Dangerous! Dealer said this issue was not part of the recall related to abs? had to go to shop 3 times before this was properly diagnosed and corrected. At 30, ooo miles the clutch needed supposed replacing, out of pocket expense ($1300), not warrantied. Never had a clutch wear out or need replacing in 20 years of driving 5 speed manual! Very next day, broke down again, had another clutch issue.. Cable broke, this was covered? towed in and repaired clutch 2 days in a row? </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a 2007 Jeep Compass and have no regrets buying it. I have the 4x4 Sports and have hand no problems what so ever. This particular make is just now really starting to catch on and I can't understand why Chrysler did not promote it as much. I get a lot of second looks while driving:-) Always wanted a jeep and this one is perfect for me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been reading the reviews that have been posted and I don't know what to say about all the problems that they have been having with the vehicle. I purchased my 1st Jeep Compass in Dec. 2006. The following May I was in a car accident when a dump truck hit my passenger side and pushed it to the driver's side. I was very grateful that the vehicle's structure was saved my life. A month later I went out and purchased my 2nd Jeep Compass and have had no problems with it. I've had it for 2 years now with 34K miles on it. I travel often to Texas from Iowa and have no issues. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love everything about it. I've managed to the MPG up to 30 when on long trips.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Jeep billed this little jewel as a great buy. I feel that I have been cheated. The fuel economy is what attracted me to this vehicle initially. After I bought it I quickly found out that the posted MPG were very WRONG. Then, within one month of purchasing the vehicle, the manufacturer posts new fuel economy numbers for the stupid thing. Guess what...they were lower than originally posted. Their response to my complaint, "Sorry.". Never again.</TEXT>

<TEXT> This vehicle was first car that I purchased along with being my first JEEP ever and let me just say that NEVER again will I step foot onto a Jeep Dealership. It could be the fact that they transmission they put in the vehicle is not serviceable as in you can't even have fluid added( was told this by a lady in the service department at the dealership)or could it be that the awful squealling sound when you go in reverse and use your brakes is only fixable by going 40mph and slamming on your brakes, or that I only have one more turn on the rotars and it's already warping again. Let's not mention the HORRIBLE blindspots that have contributed to SEVERAL close calls! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Jeep Compass new in October 2006. A month later we had a major ice storm and the AWD and anti- lock brakes worked great! I was disappointed from the start about the highway mileage I was getting, the highest ever was 27 MPG. I visit my parents who live in another state regularly. This is the first vehicle I have had in the last 17 years that could not make the trip on a tank of gas. I have had both tie-rod ends replaced under warranty and the front brakes which I had to pay for. Items that you normally don't have problems with under 30,000 miles. The CD player lacks a compression mode to even the volume out. The dash board is very clunky looking. The YES seat fabric does not work.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling. I love the grille, round headlights and the clam-shell hood. Adaptable cargo area with all the fold down seats is great along with the heavy duty removable cargo floor. Plenty of room for passengers. Drives well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got this car after driving a Honda Civic. I didn't have a lot of money, and it had a great music package available. I wanted an SUV, and have actually noticed very little difference in gas mileage after my 03 Civic. I haven't had any major issues, some lights turned on for no reason, and my drivers side window controls have been replaced, and have to be replaced again. Also, cruise developed a habit of turning off. It is very comfortable, and with the music package and price is great for young people. It is small and roomy. It is a bit unconventional looking, which I don't enjoy, but you do get what you pay for. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Was looking at the Jeep Liberty and other SUV's. Was skeptical about the Compass because of some reviews. The Compass drives more like a car and much better comfort than the Jeep Liberty IMO. Bought the FWD auto, and the power is very adequate and the ride is very smooth and quiet. Goes down the freeway at 70mph no problem. The paint finish is great. This is the wife's daily driver and she loves the comfort, style, overall handling. We bought it for town and freeway driving, not off-road. Jeep has a winner in the price group. Would recommend the 26E package and Drivers Convenience group if you like a little more power options and gadgets. </TEXT>

<TEXT>All in all this is a great suv. The only problem I have with it is the design such as seams on the inside interior like doors and exterior like the back hatch are not perfect. They do not properly meet, have grooves in the metal. So it looks cheap but others can't see it, just the poor owner.

<TEXT>Purchased the Compass Sport 4x4 with the 26E package and the Driver Convenience Group. Having Jeeps pretty much most of my life I was pleasantly surprised when I took the Compass for a test drive, it rides like a car, very smooth but firm. From the exterior the vehicle looks kind of small, however when your inside there is ample room and the interior is very comfortable. I shopped around a lot driving everything from Toyota, Honda, Mazda, etc, however the smooth ride and the look is what I was sold on. Gas mileage has been better than the sticker; city roughly 25mpg and highway 30mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cell phone holder is a nice feature, also the drivers convenience group is a must... having a built in compass, temperature, tire pressure monitor, etc, on the dash.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a 1967 TLC wagon (rebuilt with bored out engine), lots of torque, tons of gas pulls Jeeps out of the ditch, traded an Audi Allroad wagon for the Compass and it gets better gas mileage and feels safer, is quieter to drive than my Sportster. People are complaining because it's not a luxury vehicle and not an off-roader...ya think! Ask Jeep - that's the point of the Compass.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Compass is more than I expected. It is not a Ferrari nor was it intended to be. It is a good stable ride. Holds the road well and once it get up to speed it can stay with the big boys. Anyone who is looking for 0 to 60 in 10 sec won't find it here. What they will find is reasonable acceleration and wonderful fuel economy. The ride is pleasant and reasonably quiet. It is fun to drive and with autostick activated it is even more fun. I don't wince when I drive up to the pump and I leave with a smile on my face. I like it, my wife likes it and my grand kids love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my Steel Blue 4x4 Sport and I am 100% completely in love with it! It's just the perfect size for an SUV and the gas mileage is great. I couldn't be more pleased. The ride is so smooth, as well as the CVT transmission. I think all the Compass haters need to go drive one before they make their final judgment. I didn't like it at first; one test drive is all it took!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am really happy with my Compass (purchased 7/13/06). The name was a little hard to remember at first but since I starting calling her "Compass Rose" the name fits perfectly. Funny though the car is NOT equipped with a compass. I traded in my '99 Jeep Cherokee Classic so, needless to say the ride is smooth, merging into traffic is effortless even with the 2.7, 4 cylinder engine, and not remarkably slower than the 4.0 liter in my Cherokee. The interior is comfortable, plenty of room in the backseat and the back doors are very accessible. I would however, change the headrests in the rear seat, as they are a bit high and tend to restrict visibility out of the rear window. Odometer: 158 miles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Extended visors. Cargo area deck NOT carpeted. Movable console with cellphone holder. Lots of drink holders, 'map' pockets in all doors. Shift knob with Jeep insignia is cool. Control panel with odometer/outdoor temperature and dual trip odometers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have read some of the other responses and up until now we have only had the air fuel assembly intake that contains the choke/butterfly mechanism replaced as it was faulty. But in saying that in the last month our Jeep Compass has blown it's power steering system lines twice and if not plugged in if temps get below -25 C, is harder starting. First set of tires only lasted 48000 kms. I live in Manitoba and it's nothing to see -40 temps and my Jeep has been great for the first two years so now I am starting to have a finicky vehicle in winter after having virtually no trouble. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned our 2007 Jeep Compass for one year. It has 22,000 miles on it. It is the Sport 4x4 edition with automatic transmission. My wife is the primary driver of the vehicle. She loves it. We average 25 mpg. Overall satisfaction is very good. It does not have much power but it handles very well. I am over 6 feet tall and have plenty of room in either the front or rear seats. The 4 wheel drive is outstanding. We have had several snow storms this past year of a foot or more and it is like driving on bare pavement. If you are looking for an "off road" Jeep don't buy it. If you want a dependable 4x4 as a daily driver & commuting vehicle buy it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Jeep compass is one of the most overrated vehicles out there. It is not a safe vehicle, it is a vehicle with Major engine problems. I've owned it since September 2007 and I decided to drive it to my grandmothers funeral in Georgia, big mistake I barely made it home, majors engine problems, and all of a sudden my suv started sounding like a motorcycle, it have bolt and electrical problems.

<TEXT>I have to say who ever rated the Compass for edmunds is in another world than me. I have owned several Grand Cherokees and Cherokees and the Compass outperformed all of them. It is much better in the snow, (and I live in NE PA. where we get a lot of snow.) The ride is better and the gas milage is fine contrary to the person rating it states. I averaged 25 miles a gallon. The Cherokees averaged 16!! The 2007 Compass handles great and the Stereo is crisp and clear. I also selected the 18 inch chrome wheels. SHARP! The only things I have to agree with is the Compass has a pretty dull interior and is sluggish to start (only) Once up to speed it can keep up with any 6 cylinder, period!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my compass for 2 years, and I have had no major problems with it, aside from the computer needing to be flashed twice for recall stuff, but that seemed rather minor. I bought the FWD fro gas mileage, but after reading some other posts I appear to be getting pretty bad gas mileage, averaging only 25-26 on the highway, and about 20 in the city. Overall the interior has held up well but it is a bit boring when the "new" wears off. (hard plastic everywhere) I may be a bit biased (this is my first car with less than 220hp), but I think it needs more power! Put a V6 in it! All the safety computer stab. equipment works really well, but that's for another forum.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our 07 Compass one year ago. We bought it because of the warranty. I loved it in the beginning, but in the year, we have replaced 5 speakers, need new tires (only 32,000 miles)and had a tie rod replaced. Now there is a terrible noise coming from the back rear area when the brakes are applied. Took it to the dealer, they said it was a CD case rattling in the cubby in the back, well I didn't know and took off, and it is still doing it. I am not happy I am thinking there is something wrong, maybe the ABS or something. I am not a happy JEEP person at this point. Anyone else have issues with noises in the back end??</TEXT>

<TEXT>This has been an absolutely great vehicle. It has restored our faith in American automakers! We live in a rural area with lots of snow and this is great. Good tight handling, smooth transmission and lots of storage. Gas mileage is around 26-28 mpg. Very comfortable seats with an excellent sound system. We've had no problems so far after 18,000 plus miles in all kinds of weather. This vehicle gives me peace of mind for my family with all of the safety features. Why buy a Honda or Toyota when you can get a Jeep Compass!</TEXT>

Bought for 19000 now I cant even get a dealer to offer more than 7000 for it. Not reliable. Have had 3 Trans, and a motor already. I get 18 MPG in city and 12 or so on Highway. I have 5- SPD and pull 4000-4500 RPM at highway speeds. Suspension is already shot in rear. Good thing for warranty. I recommend Do NOT buy this vehicle. And I really hope someone reads this review and changes their mind. I wouldn't wish this car upon my worst enemy. Oh yeah even the "Stain resistant" seats leave spots from anything.

<TEXT>We looked at both US and import small SUV's and bought Compass based on vehicle cost and availability of CVT. Have taken long road trips and love the vehicle. Absolutely zero warranty or other problems. Average around 27 MPG on road and 25 in city driving. CVT works perfectly in mountain driving and often reaches 30 MPG due to lower average speed. Receive lots of questions from people as to how we like vehicle and know of two others buying a Compass based on our positive experience. </TEXT>

I have all the bells and whistles you can ask for in a vehicle that, I feel, is good looking to say the least. Leather Int.,satellite radio, 6cd changer, moonroof and more! I haven't had any problems except one minor one. after a while of sitting in the garage nose in without use the battery went dead (quick fix no big deal) couldn't push car when in neutral to get a jump! Weird right? Anyway, not sure of the overall long term quality and looking to compare but really, really have enjoyed my Compass up until this point! </TEXT>

<TEXT>After 60K plus miles through all sorts of weather(rain, mud, ice, wind and terrain, on and off road, our Compass 4X4, manual tranny, has been simply a wonderful vehicle, doing it all, reliably and frugally. Transporting family for a night out on the town, long trips or hauling dogs, deer corn, welders and angle iron all over our family's hill country ranch, the Compass hasn't missed a beat. 29 miles plus per gallon on the highway and 22 plus in city driving.

<TEXT>This car is amazing for what it is. The key part however, is "what it is". It is everything I expected. I purchased this for my wife, and If you are looking for a good gas mileage true 4x4 (and not those pesky AWD only things running around), there's nothing better. I have been so impressed that I sold my 2005 Ford and bought a patriot myself. I'm 6'9", and even with me driving a 6'6" person can fit comfortably behind me. This isn't true of most Cadillacs, more or less a compact SUV? The ESP and other features work wonders, and I honestly believe this may be the most versatile drive train on any vehicle. Not sure why they may a 2WD version though. jeep has turned it around big time! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The CVT is great once you get used to it, the electromagnetic 4x4 works great for onroad driving. Gas mileage is good. Easy to clean interior huge plus.

<TEXT>I love my car. It was a gift from my family. There are more positive things about my car than negative however I have had serious water leaking in my car problems. Seattle get a lot of rain. This winter my entire floorboard has been flooded due to a leak from the roof rack. A week in the shop and now I have massive water leaking through the front light dome dripping on the gear panel. The dealership is working with me and willing to replace the carpet. Because I didn't buy the extended warranty, they would not give me a loaner and they want a good review in customer service! I have complained about squeaky brakes and the rust that build up on the tire rim. Their response is that is normal. Lemon law!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather seats. Just the right size for a Grammy. Music system is wonderful! Comfortable. Attractive. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I started looking for something that was fun to drive and had a unique look. As soon as I pulled out of the dealership for my test drive, I fell in love with how it handled. I have taken it on a few road trips and had amazing gas mileage. My only gripe (which is actually a good thing) is that I have had to learn to be to overly cautious with blind spots because I am a little shorter. That aside, I have recommended not only my Compass but Jeeps in general to anyone and everyone who will listen. It is an amazing SUV that gets great mileage (I average 30 mpg highway), haven't had any problems with upkeep, and is it a lot of fun to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior console and dashboard are fantastic. There are so many little cubbies and holders for things, I never have to dig for my phone or a pen when I'm running through the bank drive through. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my Compass for about a month. With all of the features that my 4x4 Limited has, it is a great value. I would have had to spend another five to seven thousand dollars to get a Honda or Toyota similarly equipped. Fun to drive, economical, and the darker colors are not bad looking in my opinion. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seat warmers, fold down rear speakers for tailgating, satellite radio, leather seats. 5 spd. shifts nicely, and it gets decent mileage. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having switched from a 5-speed, V6 engine car, to this I-4 Jeep Compass was a huge difference (but I knew that before I bought it). The Compass has no take-off or get up & go power (so my days of quickly dashing out in front of tractor trailers and other cars are over. SMILES) However, it is still a great car and I am having a WONDERFUL time with it....so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Jeep Compass because I had heard it was a great little SUV along with great reliability....I was very wrong!! I have had the brand new Jeep for only three months and just last week the transmission went out, and it only has 8,000 miles! The passenger door makes a loud screeching noise every time you open it and the rear doors are not even flush with the car. i have to say that is one of the cheapest, and most unreliable cars I have ever owned!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought a 2007 Jeep Compass after trying several other models including the Honda Element(expensive) and the Subaru Impreza(ok). We have had the car for one year and put 18,000 miles. No problems, great in the snow, fun around town, comfortable back seat, averages 24 mpg just like it said it would. A great car that is getting a bad rap by people who don't own one. I would say look to the owners and see what they are saying. The biggest negative is the interior- which I like. And the fact it isn't "Trail Rated"- Hello McFly- not going on the Rubicon anytime soon! Give this one a second look and you won't be sorry.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove at least 6 or 7 what I consider larger hatchbacks like the Scion XB, the Element also nice but to me not worth the money. The Mattrix, the Caliber, which was okay but small inside and the Mazda3 again nice but was 2k more than the Compass and was smaller with less features. I also drove a few others the Kia which I hated, drove like a post office Jeep and the Saturn Vue which was my favorite but came at too high a price around 25K I had to stay under 20K> If I had another 5 or 6k to spend hands down I would have bought the Vue. The Compass is a great little hatchback for what I need, good gas mileage plenty of room</TEXT>

<TEXT>Frankly, a lot of people (men) discount this car because of it's cutesy looks and it's lack of a 'Trail Rated' badge. Bottom line, if you dont need a hotrod, off roader, or a luxo-mobile, take a look at it. This car is agile, does great around town, and is well equipped. The ride is firm, but I prefer it to a cushy, unresponsive one. It's reliabe, not a single problem to date. It's no drag racer, but if you would rather save money in gas, the Compass will make you happy. 18 in wheels look great, and the stock all seasons have no problem with NE winters in the second hilliest city in the country. My wife loves the compliments from fellow young women and heated leather too. </TEXT>

I was looking for a combination of the 2 vehicles and after driving the Compass I knew this was the vehicle to fill the bill.

<TEXT>I special-ordered a tricked-out 4WD Limited and it arrived in April, as promised. After 5 months and 5,000 miles, I'm very pleased with the vehicle overall. Although it's not a great highway car (yes, it's underpowered and strains at speeds over 60mph and on highway hills), the Compass is great in the Colorado mountains and on back-country roads. It's very comfortable for this 6' 230 lb male, turns on a dime, handles very well, and gets pretty good gas mileage (23mpg city/25.5mpg hwy). Almost everything is where it should be, and the fit-and-finish are terrific. I've read comments about the 'cheap' interior. I don't agree. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Wonderfully stable steering, excellent braking, great suspension. Very good sound system (with satellite radio and 6-disc CD). Very comfy seating (leather). Haven't used the ESC yet, but glad it's there. Very well-built. Rear compartment very well thought out and organized.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I fell in love with the Compass within the first 5 minutes of the test drive. It's so much fun and easy to handle. I traded in an Oldsmobile Bravada for this smaller, more fuel efficient crossover and have not been disappointed. It has tighter handling and is easier to manuever, especially when parking. My husband has a Grand Cherokee and it seems much stiffer in its handling. Like most new cars it took a couple hundred miles to break the engine in, but after a little driving under its belt the engine is extremely smooth. Overall the Compass is perfect for day to day driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior design is sleek and classy. There is so much leg room in the back seat I was amazed. Also, the wipe down cargo area is perfect for a wet dog that you don't want stinking up the upholstery!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Is the Compass a 4x4 or and AWD? That's a question that is really hard to find an answer to. The Lock in 4x4 is only good up to 10 mph. The Compsss ia a well planned out vehicle, rides smooth, goes up hills good, has great air-conditioning! Seats are easy to ride on and back seat has good room for adults! Lots of plastic inside, but easy to clean. Engine is loud, and has less than expected take off power for a 2.4 L engine. However at 40 mph and above the passing power is really good. CVT transmission is smooth and takes a little to get use to. The fuel MPG is about 23 as an average. Plenty of safety features, and many options. The Compass is rugged and takes hills very well. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Size of Compass, back seat has adjustable back, drivers seat can be mover up higher, full sized spare tire, predicttable driving, smooth ride, options that are available, easy to service, max. use of space inside, 110 volt outlet for electronic gear. sattlite radio, tire pressure warning system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've read quite a number of reviews on the Compass which would normally deter me from buying it. After test driving the Compass, I loved it. I traded in my Vibe. The Compass is quieter, rides much smoother (doesn't ride like a typical 4 cyl), more roomy. I've only put about 2,000 miles on it so far. It has plenty of pep for me and I'm getting about 30 mpg. People need to take a more serious look at the Compass, despite what the critics say. I don't have all the bells and whistles on my Compass which made it extremely affordable for me and quite the bargain.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car and the next day at about 105 miles started a 450 mile trip. I was not expecting to get 19 MPG on hwy after reading on the Jeep website that you get 380 mile range per tank full. 210 miles into the trip on flat Southern Florida hwy, I had to stop for gas and every 210 to 230 miles thereafter for the rest of the trip and on the way back. Yes A/C was on but 19 mpg. I love the car, the interior and exterior designs but I am very disappointed with the gas mileage.

<TEXT>I traded a decked out Buick Rendevous for my 4wd Jeep Compass, Sport edition. Truthfully I can't tell much difference in the performance and feel. The gas mileage was my main reason for purchase. While it doesn't get quite what I expected- average 24 mpg, it is still way better than my past vehicle. The interior is very comfortable. I can fit our two small children in the backseat with a little room to spare. The cargo space is very roomy. This car is fun to drive, and very comfortable. It even handled some very deep mud on our country road without difficulty. I would recommend this to anyone who is searching for a small SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned Jeeps for decades. Our Compass is a jewel. Our family moved to a small town about 90 miles from a big city where I work. I commute everyday. Our family has over 700 hundred acres of Central Texas Hill Country to roam as well as livestock to care for. I needed a fuel efficient 4 WD for both off and on road. My Compass has over 15,000 miles on it without a hiccup. I've hauled hundreds of pounds of feed and angle iron for welding projects in the back with the seats down, over and through rough terrain without a problem when in 4WD. We've had ice storms and flooding. The Compass handles it all. On the highway, the SUV is quick, agile, comfortable and very fuel efficient. Great SUV.</TEXT>

I've had plenty of stares and at least three women tell me they really like how it looks. The acceleration is good: good from a stop and good for passing.

<TEXT>I analyze every large purchase I make endlessly. To be honest, by the time I purchased this Jeep, I was tired of looking at it; I had reviewed and test driven it so often. But my first real glimpse of what it was capable of came to be during a recent Nor'easter that struck my small New Hampshire town. Six inches of mud, 16 inches of water, deeply gouged trails, and the Compass exceeded my expectations! So far, this Jeep has proven to be versatile, well built, and capable of alot more then one might expect out of a 4x4 "Compact SUV" based on a "Car" chassis. All this, and a comfy leather interior, and outstanding sound system.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Mopar Navigation is great, and the CVT transmission in conjunction with its ability to shift like a manual, makes the most of this peppy 4cyl engine. Yes, I said peppy! The CVT simply leads some to believe otherwise. The stadium seating is also very nice.</FAVORITE>

The CVT transmission takes a bit to get used to but other wise we love the Compass. The seats are very comfortable. Braking is excellent. A little slow off the line but it's not built for speed. Great cargo capacity and easy to get in and out of. The instrument panel is easy to read. Our only complaint is the only power switch for the door locks is on the drivers door. The rear passengers need to unlock the door by pulling up on the door lock button if the driver doesn't unlock the doors.

<TEXT>For the most part, this crossover is a pretty good vehicle for the price and features offered. Handles well and has a firm grip of the road. For under 24K, the features are what you would expect from a luxury SUV. Safety department did a solid job as well. Side airbags, electronic roll mitigation, traction control, and antilock brakes are standard. I can't tell you if they work, but knowing you have some safety back-ups gives you a secure feeling. Cons are few and simple: needs rear seat pockets for storage, cup holders swallow the average coffee cup (they are to deep and located way down in the console), the side view mirrors are suppose to fold in electrically...they don't.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Highway driving is a pleasure (not at all what you would expect from a 4 cylinder), tach reads 2100 at 75 mph and had room to keep going. Ride was even very smooth and comfortable at 75mph as well. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 2007 Jeep Compass is fabulous! In a world of monster trucks and SUV's, this is a perfect compromise for the consumer who wants the space and height of a smaller truck, but drives like a car. The fuel economy is amazing. I am averaging 25mpg (street and highway), which is great because I have been driving it a lot. Regardless of what some of the critics say about the interior being cheap, I disagree. The interior features are amazing, from the YES Essentials (non-stain) fabric, to the power windows and doors, Sirius radio, 6-in dash CD player, ample speakers, universal garage door remote control, cruise control, and Bluetooth handsfree phone feature. Very comfortable. Fun!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Although the Compass is a Consumer's Digest "Best Buy" and an Edmund's Lowest Cost to own vehicle, auto magazine critics and Jeep traditionalists have not had many nice things to say about the Compass, which almost swayed me from purchasing a new Compass. Fortunately I test drove one, and for the money, you can not beat the ride, features, safety and all around capability of this vehicle. It's fun, practical and confident inspiring. Many critics make the mistake faulting this model because it is not like the more rugged, trail rated Jeep line-up. I don't think that was ever Jeep's intent. Kudo's to Jeep for thinking and building outside the box. </TEXT>

True the interior is a little Fisher Pricey, but so many features for the price. Heated seats, Sirius, Bluetooth, 4wd, 18" tires, trip computer, ski rack (dealer after market). I traded in my 2000 CR-V. The Compass is a much tighter drive -- more car like. It is considerably smaller too. I really love it. For me I am an enthusiast for leasing an inexpensive car with all the options. It's economical for us who like features/gadgets and it makes driving fun. If you like that idea take a look at the Compass. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>9 speaker sat radio rocks. Heated seats. trip computer with tire gage, MPG avg., outside temp. Autostick -- lets you downshift 5 gears (without a clutch.) I like the tight cornering too. The lower profile makes for better handling, and the 18" tires are great for bumpy roads (and good looks). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>DISLIKES: CVT at startup in cold weather is balky. Engine is noisy during acceleration. Highway mileage is not what is expected. The Ipod/phone holder is inconvenient to use while driving. You have to turn and look back to see it. Can't use arm rest with holder open. The center front armrest is too far back to be useful. Rear window wiper is too small. Trip odometer control is hard to reach. Location of cruise control is inconvenient. Standard CD player lacks compression feature. Standard sound system bass is poor. Location of rear defrost control is small and inconveniently located. LIKES: Heater warms up fast. Handling. Folding seats. Style.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Body style, formed hood over round headlights, sloping rear window, sharply slanted windshield. Folding seats are great. Cargo area is superb for my needs. Handling is great. Turning radius is small. Large radio controls. Door lock remote in key. Cargo floor. Multiple folding seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I walked in the showroom to take care of some business and it was sitting there. I thought I really liked this truck so test drove it. Came back the next day and asked if they would sell it to me. I really love my Compass; nice lady truck - not big and bulky.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The entire truck is my favorite.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Originally shopping for the Caliber, but they were in short supply .The reason was because the Compass was being built (yes, they share the same assembly plant). It is a great car for the daily commute, especially with the Sirius radio. The rear headroom is higher, albeit the rear legroom is lacking. I should have bought one with option 26E. This would have included reclining rear seats!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy handling in tight spots. Sirius radio. Ground clearance --not too high or too low. Great braking system: Electronic Stability Program and Traction Control.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Coming from a '91 Jeep Cherokee (which I still have and love), this car is the best thing Jeep has done in a long time. Love the CVT! This has everything I wanted in a vehicle and in a Jeep and lots of it, styling, design, comfort, fuel economy, command of the road view, handling is excellent. I have all of the options, 26E package, bright silver metallic, sunroof, 6-disc changer, driver convenience group, trailer tow prep group, full size spare, YES essentials premium seats, everything but autostick and 4WD. I am tired of all the bashing people are doing in the reviews. I drove the Liberty, and am so glad I waited. Great "Badge Engineering" and nice job, JEEP!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the CVT! Interior is simple and neat, exterior is unique, love the little details, like the gear shifter, the flashlight in back, the vinyl floor, all of the comfort and style of Toyota, but I still get to stay loyal to my Jeep brand with this one! Great buy!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I sold my minivan because of the mileage. I compared this Jeep to the RAV4 and other Japanese vehicles. I am so satisfied with my Jeep purchase starting with the price. It is comfortable, economical, and handles very well in the Michigan winter. This car is worth the money and will do all you ask of it. It will not win any races but once you get it on the highway you will be very satisfied. Try it. I think you will be very surprised!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort, sound system (I have the Boston Acoustics upgrade). Economy. Road handling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Since buying my Jeep Compass last year, I have absolutely no regrets. It is the perfect vehicle for young, hip professionals that need more room than a car but don't want to sacrifice style in the process. It comes with a great sound system, comfortable seats, and lots of legroom in the back. Driving the Compass is so much fun! (Get the sunroof- it's worth it!).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sunroof, pull-down tailgating speakers, reclining back seats, audio controls on the steering wheel, Boston Acoustics subwoofer, and the great signature Jeep grill.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I think Jeep made a gigantic step forward in the design of the 2007 Compass. Until I saw and researched the feature of the 2007 Compass, I always thought the Jeep was an off road vehicle. I never liked its design, because it reminded me of a box. I realize that most Jeep models are primarily an off the road vehicle, and that the design has remained the same for years. So, I understand why some buyers are shocked to see a Jeep with a modern design, with its primary use on the highway. It is great for for those of us who live in the snow country, and yet want a family car. It would be my hope that the Jeep designers continue their forward thinking.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the design because I think the Jeep Compass doesn't resemble a box. The CVT is great. I like the easy moving into 4WD. I like the anti-lock brakes. I am happy with a modern Jeep family vehicle that has 4WD. It will take time for previous Jeep owner to get used to the modern design of the Compass.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is really amazing and I love the fuel economy. It has some zip in the city and fun in the mountains. I owned a Honda Element for 3 years and sold it and bought this dandy of a vehicle. It rides great and feels like a car, yet has the room and comfort of a expensive SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather seats, stereo, and handling on the open road, and in the curves in the mountains.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased Compass ~1 week ago after looking at many other small SUVs. Traded in a Toyota Prius as I needed 4WD for northeast winter driving. The pricing was acceptable, being less than most SUV models. The engine seems strong for a 4 cylinder. Lots of safety equipment as standard equipment. Like the lock in 4WD option and the manual shift. On the negative side, however, I'm disappointed in fuel economy averaging only about 23 mpg highway. The vehicle is truly a compact SUV. Not much leg room in rear seating area. Very limited cargo space. Several blind spots w/ solid head rests in rear seats. Front cup holders are inaccessible. Build quality is suspect with lots of hard plastics.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Standard side curtain air bags, traction control, and ESP (stability control). Lock in 4WD. Manual shift. Leather heated seats. 18" wheels provide ample clearance. American made and a Jeep!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've wanted an SUV for a While, but never liked how they handled or the gas mileage. The Compass sits a little lower and drives more like a car (can take turns a little faster. It gets good mileage, but I didn't buy it for this. It has plenty of room and is lots of fun to drive. I notice people look at me a lot, I don't know if its just a brand new car (model too) or just that I'm a good looking guy. Overall I'm very pleased with my purchase and look forward to having it a very long time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The CVT transmission, I just think it is so cool, no gears and constant power - love the feature. The Boston speaker upgrade is really nice, and the computer with gas mileage, miles till empty, and tire pressure is a cool thing to have, but it is a little awkward to use. P.S. the rear seats recline!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only had this vehicle for a short amount of time but in that amount of time I have come to truly enjoy it. What many consider negative features of the Compass truly don't understand what they're driving. Yes, from a stand still it takes the CVT some time to get to full highway speeds. However, short of drag racing or awkward on-ramps, how often does someone get on an expressway starting at 0 MPH? Lack of cargo space? Not really. The Compass has adequate space for everyday necessities, and with the 60/40 back seats I can't imagine not having enough room. I'd target this vehicle at a younger audience who want nice features with an affordable price tag.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The YES captain chairs upgrade is well worth it. Adequate leg room for even the tallest of passengers. Confidence while driving when you know you have almost every auto safety feature available to you, standard. Gas mileage!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I needed an economical small SUV. This is one great small car. It is comfortable, much less expensive than the Japanese competition. Yet it meets all of my requirements. It is economical, comfortable, handles just fine, and zips around the city. On the expressway it can compete with the big boys, just not quite as fast accelerating - after all it is only a 4 cylinder. Try it. You will be very surprised.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style, 9 speaker Boston Acoustics sound system, handling, comfort, gas mileage, sun roof.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>There is so much negative remarks about this car, all from people that don't have one. I personally love my Compass. I had to wait 2 months for it. I have the limited Jeep Green w/ beige interior, UConnect, speaker upgrade, Sirius, and security. But it was well worth the wait. The car looks much better in person than in pictures. I'm going to add Rallye lights to the grill to make it look more like a concept. For the price this car is great. I think the car should be called a rally car rather than a compact SUV. Cargo room is sufficient, my friends love it. And despite the 4 cylinders it still moves quick. Everyone complains about the plastic dash, but if it's durable then who cares.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The extra pep when passing, the bigger (standard) rims (make the car look better). The iPod hookup.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Was looking for a car for the wife. Leaning towards the Liberty, liked the look etc. and great cash incentives right now. From what I had heard Compass had no go. Test drove the Liberty then the Compass. The minute I drove the Compass knew it was the car she would enjoy. SUV look, had plenty of get up and go, plus the ride was so much better than the Liberty. It was what she wanted and is a lot more than I expected. Only options we got were the automatic, Drivers Convenience Group (recommended), the E Package (power windows etc.), Yes Essentials premium seats (recommended). The car drives great, plenty of room, zips down the freeway. Everything we wanted and more for a great price. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Paint finish, Light Khaki Metallic Clear Coat is a great finish. Ride comfort, Drivers Convenience Group (it does have a compass). Look of the Jeep front end and SUV style. Plenty of room inside and like the dash and console. Driver seat adjustment. Overall package is great for the money.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have owned the Compass for almost 2 months and have found it to be everything we wanted in this size vehicle. Love the heated seats and the ride is excellent. All the comfort details are well placed and look great. The styling is right up there with the competition and the pricing is well below others in its group. Have owned a Jeep Grand Cherokee and a Dodge Durango and this is smaller and more versatile than either if you do not need to haul a lot. Totally satisfied.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling!</FAVORITE>
