<TEXT>I bought a new Kia Sorento in Aug 07. In less than a month the engine had to be replaced. In March 08, there was a cooling system problem. In Aug 08, the key got stuck in the ignition. In May 09, there was an oil drain plug leak plus a recall on the airbag. June 09, there was a recall on the stop lamp switch. Sept 09, the key got stuck in the ignition again. This time I was told it was a shifter issue. Just want to warn people about all of the issues that I had. After the last problem I have now traded for a Toyota. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, I love the Sorento; however, at <15000 miles, the rotors had to be replaced and now at <28000 miles they're having to be replaced again. (Not my braking habits! I've been driving for almost 30 years and never had a problem with brakes!) Also, I've noticed the hesitation in speed/acceleration during driving. Sometimes it's slow to respond in a stop/go situation (slowing to a near stop then accelerating again)...kind of scary. I've been told it's because the vehicle/computer is adjusting to my manor of driving.(? At any rate, still happy with the vehicle overall.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle as a family vehicle for my daughter and I. It has met all of our needs. Interior is comfortable. Exterior is an attractive, sleek design. Turning radius is not the greatest. Factory headlights are not as bright as the headlights in my Ranger were. The back glass rattles. I agree with the post indicating that the water from teh wiper blades blows right inside when the window is down. Never had that happen before in any other vehicle. Lower gas mileage than I was told at teh dealership. But those are teh only negatives. Everything else about the vehicle is a positive. Most reliable vehicle I have ever had. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My overall driving experience with this car has been wonderful! My only disappointment has been my break wear. I think my breaks gave out on me earlier than they should have. I actually went thru a set of pads and rotors and wheel bearings I feel way to early for a brand new vehicle. Wheel bearings were under warranty but rotors and pads were not and I was not a happy camper! I bought this car as a result of renting one on vaction and really enjoyed how it handled.It rides smooth handles superbly and accelerates well. I have been on several trips with my KIA and luv how it handles on the open road. I also luv the complements I get of it being a SEXY SUV! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, love this vehicle. Very nice looking and after 19,000 miles no major problems. Very peppy and fun to drive. Gas mileage stinks, but that is true for most SUVs. If that is a major factor in your purchase, then I wouldn't buy it. For us, we only drive 8k per year so it isn't that noticeable, especially with lowered gas prices. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Sorento for almost two years and at first I loved it but after my first service it started hesitating at steady speeds or slowing down. They can't fix it because they only hook it up to a machine that tells them what is wrong and it shows nothing so they keep sending me home with the problem. I have learned a lesson about KIA's and that is to run as far away as you can get from them. They are junk. I know things happen with vehicles but normally you can get them repaired. I hate it. If you buy one you better beware because they are not worth anything when you try to trade them in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The looks of my Kia attract a lot of comments from people. It's black-two tone & sharp. All in all I will never buy a Kia again, looks are not everything. I have had numerous probs from transmission to the smell of antifreeze in the cab. I had to have the rotors replaced after 27K miles. The transmission was shifting incorrectly 3 months after purchase, I purchased it with 11 miles on the odometer, brand new.The smell of antifreeze was so strong it was making me sick. The serv dept told me there was nothing wrong with the car but the last time I took it in for this smell they finally did something, I have not smelled it since.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought it used for $15000 w/ only 12000 miles on it. Been driving it in the mountain for a month w/ no problem. Uphill driving is so easy it will cruise 60mph w/ just a little 2,000 rpm w/ no lost of power at all, unlike my 1997 chevy blazer will do 55mph w/ 3,000 rpm to sustain the uphill driving. I will write more reviews after a year of owning it :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>Outstanding fit and finish. Looked at SUV's for 6 mo and finally settled on the Sorento. Boy what a joy to drive. The looks alone make it a neat vehicle. The warranty and the dealer support is great. we love the way you sit up and the turning radius. The 262 HP is nice also. The 4 wheel dive is excellent and gets me to all my favorite fishing spots in Colorado. Buy one and you won't be disappointed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned our Sorento for almost a year now and besides the gas mileage, it has been an outstanding purchase. The vehicle looks small and agile from outside, but when you get in it and drive it, things improve to an unparalleled level of comfort. The acceleration is excellent, which does not help fuel economy. Brakes are excellent. Interior fit and finish are excellent. Had a new Sonata pull out in front of us yesterday when we were doing 55, and the vehicle's ABS and stability control worked in perfect harmony to avoid a very serious crash. Fuel economy ranges from 20 around town, to as much as 23 on a recent trip to the Outer Banks. Buy with confidence. This is a great vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>ABS, Stability Control, Solid feel of vehicle overall. Quiet cabin. It pulls a 16 ft Stratos bass boat with no problems whatsoever. The engine is an absolute beast for this size vehicle. Incredible. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have 3,800 miles on my Sorento. Owned a Sportage a few years back and went back for another KIA after my Ford Explorer. The last tank of gas, city driving, 21 mpg accurate check. It is breaking in well because it is a 4WD. For my passengers, I wish the back seat had a bit more leg room. Most of the time I drive it alone anyway. I love the gray interior. The paint must be strong because it has been through 3 hail storms since I bought it. In appearance it is just like a Lexus SUV a couple years old. I love it. I drove many vehicles, of all brands, and the only thing that said "BUY ME" was my KIA Sorento. For traveling to my 2nd home in N. Iowa, the 4WD is a must. Great!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior features with the burnished walnut trim - very deluxe in appearance. Convenience of controls and console. Heating system, though no rear heat or air, circulates beautifully. Much better than my Explorer did. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>7500 miles with this Sorento - feels comfortable to drive and has good visibility. In town mpg average is 15- 16 and best on the road at 65 MPH is 25. (accurately measured - not guessing). Most annoying though is the transmission. At 10-15 mph it stays locked in 5th gear and the vehicle will actually start to jump a little as this is too slow for this gear. Step on the gas and you aren't going anywhere in a hurry. The trans should shift itself down to match road speed. This is my biggest disappointment with this vehicle and the dealer says that is just the way it is.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Funny how things end up. I was driving a 2004 A8,top of the line. I was in the dealer every month, and one time got a Kia Sorento as a rental while my A8 was in the shop. Well, fell in love with it, traded in my A8 and never looked back. Fantastic Suv 4x4, no issues, runs great, handle fantastic, fun to drive, good looking. Kia is a great SUV/Truck, simply great. Oh, did i mention the warranty!! WOW! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was very skeptical of the Kia brand as I only bought Fords my whole life so far. But I have to say after only a few months of ownership the value was outstanding. The truck performs great and I only wish the gas mileage was a bit better. No issues with 3000 miles on it so far and I am so happy with it. Great performance and stopping. Awesome value!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this after looking at the competition. Nothing else in this price range (21,000) can come close. Sorry, but it just would not happen. I was very leery about purchasing a KIA and if not for the warranty I would not have considered this car. I actually have to say, that so far it has been just perfect. I have 5,000 miles now, and everything seems to be in place. The only possible complaint is that the dealer did not properly remove all the protective plastic properly. MPG seems to be a little better now that the engine has broken in. I think I am managing about 20 - 21 mpg on average now. I am still impressed with the performance and power of this vehicle and I am very happy so far</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Kia by trading in my Nissan Armada. I was commuting on weekends from my home in Dallas to my parents in Jacksonville, Tx. I went from $65 in gas to $40 and also about 4 more days before I had to fill up. My son has plenty of room in the backseat in his carseat with his books, crayons, and DVDs. The Armada was so high, I always had to open the door for him. Now, he gets on in. I do contract work for a florist and the easels fit nicely. I make arrangements in my home and I have plenty of room to put everything. The engine is very quiet, it handles great in the rain. I love my Sorento!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is roomy, plenty of leg room for a carseat without getting dirt on the seat in front. Great gas mileage. Double phone jacks, and one in the backseat. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our third Kia and couldn't be happier. The Sorento handles great and has a very solid and quiet ride. All of the controls are in easy reach of the driver. I feel better knowing that I have a full size spare tire instead of a "donut". I commute 90 miles a day and feel safer in a Kia than any other vehicle I have ever owned. We have found all of our Kia vehicles to be of the highest quality. Their vehicles are luxury quality at an economical price. Kia offers one of the best warranties around which we have never had to take advantage of. Kia has higher specifications for their vehicles, dealerships, sales and service of any other make of vehicle we have ever owned. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned 3 Cadillacs, 3 mini vans, a 1988 Jeep Commanche (ordered from the factory while I was stationed in Germany), a 1997 Grand Am. Sorento has the minivan's room, the comfort of Cadillac, the fun to drive sporty handling of the Grand Am, and a bigger foot print and smoother ride than the Jeep. Kia has an obvious comittment to safety. They have more standard safety features than the big three at a better price. Michelin P24570R16 tires on stylish machined aluminum wheels, even the spare. I am very happy with my fuel economy, 400 miles per tank, running the AC constantly. Some people balk at the speakers, that's why God made Polk audio.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In the past 20 years I have owned 9 major brand SUVs. This one is by far the best of the lot. All the other simular SUVs cost more but deliver less. Just take a good look at what Kia offers; it makes me think that any review less then tops would be hard to do. The Sorento EX should sell for at least $28,000 and it still would be a great deal. At $25,000, with a V6, what could you buy that compares?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2005 Sportage and upgraded to the Sorento because I purchased a boat and needed a vehicle to pull it. With a towing capacity of 5000 lbs you can't beat it. I got this one fully loaded with the Luxury Package. My Sorento is black with tan leather interior. This vehicle handles great and has more than enough power. Yeah, the gas mileage is not the best, but it is pretty average of other 6 cylinder SUVs. And if you are up for it, this vehicle can do some off roading. The Sorento was rated in the top 14 SUVs as a true off road vehicle. This was done by USA Today 3 years ago.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather seats, sunroof. There is adequate storage space and plenty of little cubby holes for coins and small items. I also recommend the all-weather floor mats. Great for rainy areas as well and mud and dirt.</FAVORITE>

There is also peace of mind with the best bumper to bumper warranty out there. We have only had the SUV for a few weeks. In time we will see why the mfr. is so generous and confident here.

<TEXT>The engine with select shift is fantastic. The heated leather seats are great quality. The ride is solid, and having low range is key. It is fast, the 5 speed auto is smooth, the torque will let you out accelerate most. This is the perfect sleeper vehicle. Quality issues of Kia are a thing of the past, although I think consumers will be ahead of the press on the issue for a while. Sorento did top JD Power and Strategic Vision 2007 awards, so maybe this is being noticed. If you compare this vehicle like I did, when test driving forget about the badges and this is very hard to beat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Kia now makes a quality mid sized SUV. True it is truck based and rides over hops a bit unsteady, but all SUVs built on a truck chassis do. On the beach or the trails this SUV shines. It truly handles light trails like a Jeep, albeit more refined in cabin and appearance to boot. Gas mileage is better than advertised with 26 highway and 20 around town. After I get sick of this vehicle I will use it to tow stuff with, the engine is awesome.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Sorento 2 months ago after long research about the vehicle. I gave it a try because the looks of the car and the engine. When I went to the dealer and tested it, I got impressed and bought two of them, the other for my wife. What I like the most is that it has a smooth ride and the engine is very powerful for the Texas highways. It handles well on bumpy roads. My wife almost crashed hers, but the car handled very well and nothing happened. The drawback of the car is the sound system. The front speakers have an average power but the rear ones are very weak. The car has plenty of storage spaces, cup holders and lighting consoles which are nice features.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this Kia after looking at and driving the Jeep Patriot & GMC Acadia. The 4x4 operation is very smooth. The build quality really impressed me. The wife loves the safety at 5 star rated with knee bags included. The auto-stick 5 speed is awsome. Great power from the engine. Hushed and refined. The price "bang for the buck" is hard to beat. Lots of safety, performance, build quality and features. I shopped for about five months before purchasing. Gas mileage is not bad, 18 mpg in town. The moon roof leaves plenty of head room for the 6' 1" driver. 100,000 mile warantee sold me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Kia Sorento for a little over a month, and absolutely love it. It provides a comfortable ride, good horsepower, great storage, and cargo room. It is convenient to have the stereo controls on the steering wheel so you do not have to reach over 20 inches change the station. Ha, ha. It took a little work and waiting for my dealer to find the color/option that I wanted (Radiant Red with a sunroof), but it worked out. I test drove an Acura MDX and BMW X5, but found the Sorento shared many of the same features, gas mileage, etc. for less money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our Kia as an alternative to a minivan and could not be happier. It's plenty large for a family of 5 comfortably. If you try to open the rear door in your garage you might find it a bit interesting. Living in the mid-west, winters get cold and the wiper defroster is awesome. Spring for the 4WD if in snow climates. Engine has lots of torque and even with enhancement features you might find yourself gripping the wheel with all your might. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty transmission, engine power, the sound the doors make when you close them, visibility, and RWD performance. Plethora of air bags.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Absolutely love my Kia. Excellent performance. Lots of power. Fun to drive. Kia thought of everything with this vehicle. It turns and parks very easily in tight spaces. There is plenty of room for five adults and lots of space in the rear. Gas mileage isn't the best but it is what I would expect given the level of performance/power. Vehicle drives very solid. Handles superb in inclement weather. Only have 1500 miles on it. The only problem encountered was a check engine light coming on which turned out to be a faulty intake sensor. Dealer fixed it in a few minutes and I have not had any other problems. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turn radius/handling characteristics, acceleration, roomy interior, rear seats fold flat for level loading, overall comfort, solid feel, heated leather seats, excellent fog lights, outstanding warranty. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my Sorento for 2 weeks now and I love it! It's so much fun to drive. There's plenty of room, however the vehicle itself doesn't feel too big or "trucky". It's handles great and the styling inside and out is awesome (take a look at the Lexus SUVs, aside from the emblems they're almost identical to the Sorento).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks of this SUV are amazing! The engine has lots of get up and go. The sound system is also great. There's also a lot of handy storage compartments inside the Sorento.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>You have to drive this vehicle. Powerful, fun, and looks great. The transmission is awesome, it's manual and automatic so you can pick your gear. Plenty of room for moving what I need, but not a land yacht with a lot of wasted space. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Transmission. I love all the power and changing the gear as I please.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle is of extreme poor quality. The electronics started to fail immediately (e.g. radio, remote device, doors locks). Lack of quality control is appalling.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The vehicle has high clearance.</FAVORITE>
