<TEXT>Makes driving fun. Fuel is not bad, but could be better - 21-27. Had an oil leak when I first got it, but they fixed it, and it has been good. I did have a problem with the rubber filler along the fenders discoloring. That was replaced, but will need done again. I park in the same sunny place every day. Good visibility over cars in the same class.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy - console holds a lot and has a rear outlet that is reachable from the front, so I can plug in a GPS in front, and charge a phone at the same time without an adapter. The dip in the dash holds the GPS where you need it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Hyundai in August of 2007 and haven't looked back since. It's reliable, fun and roomy. When comparing to other similar type vehicles (equinox, RAV, etc.,) you simply can't beat the reliability and price. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fold down seats that lay flat, roof rack, sound system, heated outside mirrors (I live in MN), windshield that lifts independently of the back door.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned my Tucson for 6 months. We have driven it all over Florida and back and forth to Kentucky a couple times. When it comes to long-distance driving, I can drive for many hours while remaining comfortable. It is also very good on gas. The sound system sounds incredible. I can't say enough about how much I love this little truck. When we travel, we fold down the back seats for our two border collies. It's perfect for them.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The fact that the rear window opens independently of the hatch, the gas mileage, the stereo and the safety features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently purchased an 08 Tucson SE. I had been looking for a compact suv. I needed something awd or 4wd, with enough room to haul golf clubs, get me where I need to go in style, and not cost an arm and a leg. The looks of the vehicle are great, it's fun to drive, I feel safe safe in it, I get tons of compliments and no one can believe that I spent so little on it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety features are excellent, love the roomy interior, exterior design looks sharp, love the push button 4wd, back glass opens independently of door, CD-MP3 compatible, comfortable interior on long trips.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Shopped for a year for the right Mini SUV. Test drove the Ford Escape, Explorer, Saturn Vue, Suzuki, and Chevrolet Equinox, among others. The Tucson's features and Quality beat them all, hands down, not to speak of the pricing. If you want value for your dollar, test one yourself. American Car Makers, especially, still don't understand that. I drive my vehicles for 10-12 years, and if I take care of them, I expect them to hold up, not fall apart before my eyes. Hyundai builds a solid product. I expect to be driving this vehicle for many years to come.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MPG rated at 22 city, 26 Highway. I usually get 24 city, 28 Highway! Roomier and smoother ride than the vaulted Escape. Fit and Finish are exceptional. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my 2007 Tucson for 18 months. It continues to perform pretty much in the way I would expect. The back is quite roomy and will hold luggage for 4 easily. Mostly, I use the back to transport my dog. It's perfect for that, especially with the addition of the cargo tray. I drive 80 miles daily (round trip) to work. I have no complaints about the performance and handling of this vehicle on country roads, expressways and city streets. It's small enough to maneuver in city traffic, but peppy enough to keep up with the demands of highway driving. If you want a small (SUV) truck, this is a great vehicle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, the vehicle is decent but we've had issues with water leaking through the seal of the sunroof after a modest rain fall or through a car wash. Also, there is an associated whistling sound from the sunroof at speeds above 60 MPH. Have seen other Tuscon' have this same problem by making the dealer apply a garden hose over the sunroof. Hyundai claims this is this designed to happen. I don't believe their claim and I did not spend money on a brand new vehicle that is supposed to leak into the interior. Very disappointed and will take my business elsewhere in the future to more reliable auto manufacturers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove about 7 vehicles from my list (I did some homework before shopping) and kept coming back to the Tucson. It had everything I wanted. It was small, stylish and plenty of get up and go. I drove the 4cyl and 6cyl versions. I lucked into a sweetheart of a deal on a 2007 Limited. It has all the bells and whistles I could ever want. If you're considering an SUV, do not write the Tucson off just because it's a "Hyundai." It's the smoothest riding, zippy, most fun to drive car I've ever had. My only bad thing to say is if you're concerned about today's gas prices, this is not your car. I average 18.6--which is good compared to sticker--but at $4 gallon...</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is so nice and comfortable. Leather seats--would have actually preferred the cloth. LOTS of room. I have a car seat and carry a full sized stroller.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought car 3 months ago and I've had it in for service 5 times in the last month and a half for a squealing problem it makes when I first turn it on in the morning. Very unhappy with the dealership and service techs at van dyn hoven for not fixing what seems like a simple problem and offering a loaner vehicle. Gas mileage is less than 20 mpg's. Sunglasses holder to small and doesn't fit glasses. Fuel door broke off already when my husband bumped it with his arm when putting fuel in. Made of cheap plastic. Headrest and armrest are also awkward for me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I honestly love driving my Tucson, Its a fun car to drive especially when your using the Shift/Tronic Shifter in it... It can be a blast... Car can be very comfortable especially for long road trips... Awesome gas mileage, and even with a 4 Cyl engine my car off the line takes off pretty quick and is def. not scared to go fast.. I would recommend this car to anyone who enjoys keeping a nice car, the car is very easy to keep clean, The Tucson now has approx. 9,100 Miles and still runs like it was from the showroom floor. I had some complications with the dealership upon buying the car, and am still a little un-satisfied with them.. But can not bring myself the trade the car in and get a new 1</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this vehicle. I have a round trip commute of almost 100 miles a day and the Tucson has done awesome. I also went on a 2500 mile road trip with it only a month after I got it and went through everything with it. Blinding lake effect snow in the mountains, flat lands, New York City traffic and the it always did great. Its a comfortable ride (kept my teen relatively happy for long trip), stereo sounds wonderful, enough storage too. It's a great looking vehicle too. I get a lot of compliments on the dark metallic grey along with the matching SE trim on the bottom.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the vehicle overall. Considering I spend so much time in it, the ride is very comfortable, quiet, handles great. Wonderful for all 4 seasons. I love the stereo ..

<TEXT>This is my first SUV. I traded in a Toyota Corolla which gave me excellent gas mileage but was a very uncomfortable ride, particularly for my lower back. I was a little nervous about buy a Hyundai based on previous low ratings. So, I test drove the Honda CRV, Toyota Rav4, Ford Escape and the Nissan Xterra. I was not impressed with any of these models. However, The Hyundai Tuscon passed all tests with flying colors (comfort, style, color, reliability, etc., etc. I just love it!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I ve had my Tuscon for several months now. I love the design and layout - both inside and out. Very impressed with the quiet, smoothness of the ride. Handles corners very well. But lacks power on hills. You would expect better from a 6 cyl SUV that only gets 23 MPG. Just things to consider. However, for me the pros outweigh the cons. I am very happy with the purchase. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of space in a small SUV. Very roomy interior. Controls are layed out well and convenient to operate. Lots of extra cargo space (nice design). There were a variety of cool colors to select from. I love the Alpine Frost.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this in February of 07. Had a baby on the way so needed something besides my Mustang to tote a kid. Overall this was a great choice, made after a lot of research. I find the milage to be great, cargo room surprisingly large and driving comfort to be outstanding. I also tested a Santa Fe and even though it's the next "bigger" model, I felt it had less headroom than the Tucson. On the downside, it does seem a little underpowered, especially with the air conditioning running. I also don't like that the power supplies (lighter and rear cargo area) don't have power unless the engine is running. That sometimes makes it difficult to charge the cell phone. Overall, I dig it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is nice but it doesn't get the traction one would expect from a 4WD. The tires have a "B" traction rating which would mean lower end. Other than that it's not a bad SUV. In many ways it's better than the more expensive counterparts. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice looking car. No major blind spots. I looked at the Toyota Cruiser. It's very boxy looking and the pillars present blind spots. I also like the spare tire hidden, not in the way on the back door (like many SUV's). The tuscon is also a very quiet ride. On board computer is an awesome touch.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've had our Tucson SE for four months now and love it so far. We have driven it in mountains on one long trip from Wis. to N.C. and it preformed well. We got 4,400 miles on it so far, and enjoy driving it very much. We have read some reviews saying they got poor gas mileage, so far were getting close to 23mpg overall. We like the size of this SUV its is a very roomy five seater. We also love the color we chose alpine frost.</TEXT>

I am 6'3" tall weighing in at 250+ lbs and have back trouble. Any sugestions for my next car ? Escalade: too big for the garage. Element: too clunky of a drive. Rav4: too long with the tire on back. CR/V: also too long (but at least they put the tire away). Tuscon: Eureka !! It is a SUV for my back and yet it is small enough for the garage. I got the LTD which is luxurious enough.

<TEXT>Only have had the car about a week but it drives great, real smooth and has comfortable seating. I love the Nautical Blue color I have. So far no issues, but I have only 320 miles on it. I am a loyal Hyundai owner (traded in my Elantra plus my husband has an Elantra) and the Tucson does not disappoint what I have come to expect with Hyundais. I got the base model, but boy is it loaded with features for a base model! The only complaint I have is the GLS seems to be a touch underpowered at a 140 HP 4-C engine. But then again, the 4-C gets better gas mileage too. Got almost 400 miles to my 15 gallon tank full, so that's not bad. </TEXT>

I am getting 23 MPG, mixed 1/2 interstate and city traffic. I looked at 4 other SUV; Pontiac Torrent, Saturn, Jeep Compass, and KIA Sportage. The user friendly interior sold me. Entire back seats fold down completely flat (plus they recline). Lots of nice touches. Not the least of which is it's nice looking and has a great projected durability according to C.R. </TEXT>

<TEXT>At 4,700 miles not only has the engine really livened up but the mpg is now 20.1 avg with a DC-area commute. This vehicle has more safety equipment than any in its class or price range and weighs 3,500 lbs so that considered, I am very happy with the mpg. Fit/finish is impeccable. Space utilization superb. Seat comfort/leg/headroom amazing even with sunroof front and rear. I am extremely proud of my Hyundai and when people look it over they are amazed. When they ride in it they remark how smooth and quiet it is. I am thrilled to have a vehicle that's ready for all 4 seasons, can carry more than a sedan, is easy to park and is a blast to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gosh, everything! It's wonderful to have ABS, Electronic Brake Force Distribution, ESC, 4WD, 8 airbags, Tire-Pressure Monitoring System. Can't wait for the icy weather to try out the electric front windshield wiper de-icing element. Foglamps up high make a lot of sense.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my Tucson for only a week and I have to say I am loving it. The drive is rather quite and smooth. The safety features are outstanding and one of the main reasons I purchased this vehicle. The air conditioner is excellent and in Galveston, Texas this is needed due to the heat and humidity. The only complaint I have is the gas mileage. My first tank of gas was averaged out at 17 mpg. This is mostly city. I am hopeful it will improve a little with time. The space for cargo is excellent and just with a base model I couldn't be happier with the comfort. My passengers love the reclining back seats. And the roominess is great. It looks bigger on the inside than it is.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove all the compact SUVs on the market and finally decided on the Tucson. I never would have considered a Hyundai, didn't know anything about them as they are not widely driven in my area, but was suggested by a friend in another state because of the warranty. I read every review out there and liked what I read. I loved the car when I drove it, and it had all the options I wanted standard that I would pay thousands extra for in my other choices (Subaru Forester and Jeep Patriot were my top 2). I prefered the gas mileage and styling of the Patriot and reliabilty of the Forester, but when it came down to it the Tucson won out overall. It is a very stylish car and fun to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It feels very roomy for a compact, and the interior is well designed. Love the standard features (including ESC, tire pressure gauge and extra airbags). The interior fabric is good quality and I love the feel of the leather wrapped steering wheel. And really, the 10 year warranty is just awesome.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I started out looking at the Ford Edge, the Honda CRV and the Mazda CX-7. The Tucson wasn't even on my radar. The need for premium gas nixed the Mazda and $34,000 plus change for an Edge with the sunroof gave me pause, but I was ready to buy. The warranty and standard saftey features of the Tucson made me take a look. I expected to be underwhelmed during the test drive, but was pleasantly surprised. After driving a Jeep Wrangler for 11 yrs, the Tucson had the soft, quiet ride I was looking for. The Limited offered a lot of bang for the buck and I bought one for $24,650 OTD. The $10,000 dollar savings sealed the deal. Very pleased after 1,100 miles. Still in love.</TEXT>

<TEXT>In 8 months our Tuscon has left us stranded (wouldn't start due to the alarm module failing), required a new power steering pump (it was making awful noises), and decided to dump all its 4WD transfer case oil into our driveway. It's also been in for factory recalls. It's spend A LOT of unplanned time at the dealer (twice going in on a flat bed tow truck). It's not very confidence inspiring when it keeps having such serious problems? We like to backpack, and had the problems happened deep in the woods, we could have been seriously stranded. Hyundai roadside service is useless there. The gas mileage is no better than many MUCH larger SUVs which is also embarrasing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This car is a great value on paper and has several advantages over its competition. It's quiet, well laid out and performs well. But the competition is improving and Hyundai will need to revise the Tuscon soon to stay competitive. We regret not buying the new CR-V.</FAVORITE>

Overall I have to say I under estimated it. I LOVE THIS SUV, I had 2 blazers before this and man they were gas hogs, this gets around 300mi off a full tank. It has the same motor as the tiburon so the performace of a 4cyl is equal and I liked that alot! What more is there to say I LOVE THIS TRUCK!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Well I like having the only copper color in NYS as of right now! The interior is more spacious than most smaller SUV's. Performance is awsome I just turned 18 and as you all know we guyz at this age have a lead foot I cant complain she knows how to MOVE!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am so in love with this car, If I could marry it, I would! I got the Desert Sage, Base level model, but even with that, the SUV comes loaded with lots of things standard. I had an Elantra (two of them, actually), so the fact that this is built on an Elantra carriage is great. It rides like a car, but I am ever mindful to not take corners like Speed Racer. I have the 4 cyl, so there isn't a lot of "pep" per se and it feels sluggish on accleration, but I just plan accordingly. Sound system is great in the interior cabin. I like the fold down seats and the lumbar support, but it would be nice if the passenger side front seat had lumbar support as well. Overall, it's a GREAT car for the price!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fold down seats in the back; riding up high and seeing everything; wide panoramic view.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car is great. Right now I am especially disappointed in the gas mileage. It is supposed to get 20 city 26 highway. I do mostly highway travel and I can barely get 17-18 mpg as an average overall.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We love the spacious interior, heated seats, easy stow and go rear seats.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been researching compact SUVs for a year and finally my wife decided it was time to get rid of the 99 Lumina and the Tucson was the front runner by far. All other compact SUVs lack either the HP (CRV & RAV4) or bells and whistles that the Tucson had, and at $2,000 to $3,000 more; if I wanted to spend that much more money I would buy a Mazda CX7. My back doesn't hurt putting my kid into the vehicle anymore. Make sure that you get a V6 engine though.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A smooth ride that handles well, almost like a car; heats up quickly in 10 below Minnesota winter; good sized cargo space; seats fold down flat (doesn't in CRV); safety (airbags and TCS); big windshield; getting out is easy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first SUV and 6 cyl. car so I'm having to make some adjustments. I really like the solid feel of the Tucson. It's very quiet driving down the hiway, feels like I'm gliding. Takes bumps and dips with ease. My friends like the extra room in the rear seats. Wish the rear windows were not tinted as it's harder to park at night but, I may like it better in the summer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the layout of the controls, wipers, fog lights, blade deicer etc. Very solid, feel very safe in it. 5 star ratings for side and front crash.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car seems quiet while driving. It is sometimes fun to drive. legroom in the back is spacious also in the front. The interior design is quite nice but it looks like any ordinary interior. Exterior design is unique but the front looks kind of ugly. You can not judge a veicle by it's design you must judge it by its engine performance and veicle comfort enguine is quite economical and clean and riding comfort is quite good.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather seats, rear space, fuel ecenomy, sterio and it's silent engine (gasoline model)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Liked the look and features. Really liked the price and loved the drive. I went from a large SUV and I'm happy I chose the Tucson. I golf a lot in summer (room for two bags and two carts with shoes, etc.)and ski a lot in winter. Plenty of room for our gear and roof rack for skis. Nice tight suspension. Handles very well. Plenty of clearance for driving on Vermont roads during ski season. Heater works very well. Vehicle is very warm. Seats firm and comfortable.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>* Front wheel drive which automatically converts to 4-wheel drive as needed. * V-6 engine is much more powerful than 4-cylinders found in some of the competitors. * Front seat folds down. Good for tabletop. Also, great for getting the occasional long item in vehicle. * Cup holders</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>From day one this has been a great SUV fun to drive on and off road (more fun off road). Controls all have great locations, but AC light ( don't know if it is on or off during the day with that little green light.) I have always had V8's so this was my first 4 cyc. At first it seemed a little slow to start, but what I soon came to realize is that I almost always had a jack rabbit starts with the V8's. Now I feel real comfortable with the 4 cyc, but what is the best is that I get 25 miles per gal arround town. This is much better than Hyundia's claim of 23 MPG. If your looking for a new car or SUV test drive a Tucson, you will not regret it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The feel of off road driving, the way the back opens up and space to store almost anything.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just received this 2007 SE model as a replacement for my 2006 GLS which I had to lemon law due to charging system problems. So far, no problems with this 2007 model except for a leaking rear window that was fixed. The engine has nice power and the stability control and traction control keep the truck going straight and under control. The interior is roomy and the controls right at hand. Four wheel disc brakes along with dual exhaust are really nice. Mine came with Bridgestone tires this year comapred to BF Goodrich last. The "Bridges" have a much nicer ride and a lot better tread pattern that will do fine in the snow I believe. So far, I'm quite happy and content!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dash layout, rear compartment, four wheel disc stopping power, traction control with stability control is an awesome system. The paint job is really nice and stays shining for a while after waxing! Power is smooth but a bigger V6 would be a lot nicer!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car meets all of our requirements. That's why we bought it. We're a younger couple with a baby on the way and a big dog that goes on all of our road trips with us. It's comfy, attractive, and great for every day adventures. It's easy to operate and I absolutely love it!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like how the glass in the back door opens seperately for easy loading. The dash controls are easy to use, and we love the fold down seats. This car rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought it on 11/15/06. Traded in a 2001 Ford Escape. More room than the Escape. Much better gas mileage. Got the two tone platinum. Doesn't show dirt. Everything within reach. Miss the leather and the 6 cd changer from the Escape, but glad I made the purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Shopped for a resonably priced small SUV, to replace my wifes aging Cadillac, She wanted to sit higher with better visability, and fuel economy The Tucson fit the need very well, only having it for a short time though- so cannot make a determination as to reliabilty--However it sure is very well appointed, and the build quality is nice--terrific feature set for the bargain minded</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only owned it for a short time, but it's got me hooked. I traded my 2002 RAV4 for it, and I have no regrets. (I did like my RAV, so this is not meant to denigrate that wonderful car.) My insurance was about $3 different, and I absolutely love the color. (I chose Alpine Frost, which looked dark in the book, but is rather light and won't show dirt easily.) I'm so glad there was something other than silver available. The V6 moves. After my little 4-cylinder, the power took some getting used to -- unless I wanted my first ticket! The Tucson is comfortable, versatile, and looks good. I'll write again after I've had it for a while...</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The back opens up, rather than to the side like my old RAV. Also, the glass can open separately from the door. Bother of these features make it easier to get stuff in and out.</FAVORITE>

<FAVORITE>Knobs for A/C and Heat...easy to see and use.The rear hatch door with the window being able to open.I'm 6 ft. and I have plenty of leg room and head room.I was surprized how much power the V6 has.Spare tire compartment is nice.It also has a lot of little storage area's through out the interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just bought a brand new '07 Tucson. I traded in an '04 Volvo S40, and initially was a little wary of buying a Hyundai due to the past stigma of these being crappy cars. I quickly changed my mind when I saw how many features came standard on a base model (which is what I got). For example, the electronic stability control system, the 6 airbags, keyless entry and alarm, power locks and windows, ABS brakes, and of course the amazing warranty. We have only had our Tucson for 2 weeks, but we love it! It is well designed and very fun to drive. I would recommend this car to anyone.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The sporty design is great. The standard safety features. All the little storage "niches".</FAVORITE>
