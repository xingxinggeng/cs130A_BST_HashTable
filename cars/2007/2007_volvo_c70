<TEXT>Bought our C70 through the Overseas Delivery Program. You get 2 round trip tickets to Europe (anywhere, anytime, even peak season!), a night at the best hotel in Gothenburg, a free tank of gas (worth about $170!), insurance while you are there, a nice tour and lunch, and of course the car is shipped back. We took the all night ferry to Kiel-a beautiful trip thru the fjords. Ask to book the ferry at the factory, and you get a Volvo discount. We drove thru Germany, France and Belgium then up to Amsterdam, about 2000 mi. The car turned heads everywhere, it gets good mileage and is a practical extravagance. Buy a portable nav with European maps in the US before you go- we didn't, and wish we had</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The top is ultra cool-yet practical. Everything works well on this car. Great stereo!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wouldn't even consider buying a car without Sirius, locking gas cap, and good gas mileage. This car offers the above with the best audio quality of any car I've experienced. The 6 speed manual with use of 87 octane gets me 21mpg between by highway and city driving. I would probably get better mileage with the suggested 93 octane. That is decent considering the car is built solid and the engine is 2.5L turbo. My only 2 complaints is the driver's left side elbow rest is uncomfortable during long rides. Second I continue to experience small issues with the convertible top software. The car sometimes thinks the roof is open when it isn't so you have to open and close it to reset the sensors.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hopefully the feature I never have to use which is the safety aspect. Audi makes a good convertible as well, the A4 but the A4 has a poor safety rating unless they recently improved it. Also the wheels and color coded exterior functional door guard lines and built in mirror signalers look fantastic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I saw my C70 being built in June of 2006 in Udevalla Sweden and took overseas delivery of it in September. It is loaded with the nav system and the premium sound system. The car has been flawless in performance. The car continues to draw appreciative remarks from people, especially when I put the top down or up. I still have the manufacturer's plates on the front of the car. Look forward to purchasing another Volvo in 2010.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Where do I begin? I have had 6 red cars and 4 different convertibles in the past 30 years. I wouldn't trade this one for all of them. Everywhere I go, people ask me about it and compliment its appearance. It is fun to drive, looks hot, and I have had only a couple of minor service issues (I am at 37000 now) and the dealer bent over backwards to correct them. This is my 2nd C70 and they really improved it over the old rag top version. Its quiet, doesnt leak in the rain, and i have the top dowm most of the time! Buy one and go get a date!</TEXT>

<TEXT>More fun in a Volvo than one could imagine. It is different too. Swedish cool that turns heads without being ostentatious. There are dozens of BMWs out there. So if you want something that does pretty much exactly the same thing, but isn't "me too", go for the C70.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Naturally the roof. But over time the small coat hook and lockable storage win out too, which the BMW has neither.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got one of those 6000 imported C70 2007 babies, and I'm really enjoying it. It is Magic Blue Pearl with white interior. Best, most intuitive interior I have ever owned. I think it is called ergonomics. I also get people stopping me all the time to admire the car. Auto trans is a lagger at the light, but acceptable for people who don't care to shift. There is a pull to the right during accelerated lane changes at higher speeds, but again, it is OK if you know it is part of the turbo right twist phenom. I took it to Yosemite and over 9,000 feet mountain passes and the car was fantastic. Overall, it is a great ride, and a nice, safe drive. Let's hope I can get parts as it ages. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Outstanding upgraded sound system, Looks great with top up or down and I love the overall fit and finish of the product, the solid "thunk" of the trunk lid closing, took me back to the 1950s!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only had the vehicle for 7 weeks however I am very satisfied with the performance of the vehicle. The only downside thus far is the gas mileage. I have only been getting about 18 MPG in the city.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My 6 month old C70 has been in the shop twice because of roof rattles, roof still rattles. Volvo just sent out a "Campaign Notice", recall? Another trip to the dealer! After a minor fender bender, repairs took 2 months, primarily due to parts being on "national backorder". One came in a mislabeled carton, it took an additional week until the right part came from Sweden. A week later, the roof and trunk stuck half way open necessitating an emergency tow and more shop time! Apparently few techs are trained to work on the C70. Volvo is not supporting this car with parts inventory/tech training. Some customer service reps were surprisingly rude. Not what you'd expect from Volvo, a disappointment.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This is a fun driving car when you can drive it, better have a spare! On a beach trip, there was room for luggage with the top down. It's an attention grabber, you can't be inconspicuous in it! This could be a great car, if Volvo works out the kinks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had nothing but trouble with this car. It began at about 3,000 miles with a new fuel injector, gas tank & line, then moved on to strange noises upon starting, broken button on seat, first the passenger window quit working, now the driver window won't stay closed. I have had it in the shop 5 times for 8 problems. I am in the process of trying to sell them back this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Volvo C70. I really enjoy the hardtop and the Dynaudio system. I have had to bring the car back to the dealer numerous times for the same two issues. The front windows were not going all the way up when the doors closed. It took five tries before they fixed this issue. The other issue is the full spare tire. Every time I hit a bump of any type in the road the tires rattles around in the trunk. Volvo has looked at this issue at least 5 times and still can't figure out a way to stop it. They are looking into a foam base for it to sit on. They believe it might be a recall issue down the road.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Simply a wonderful automobile... sedan by rainy day, dream car by sunny day! We love our '07 Volvo C70! Nice lines, better looking with the top down. It's an awesome car to drive. Compared it to the VW EOS and thought we would save money by getting the EOS. One drive in the C70, DynaSound, Premium Package and we were both sold! She loves it. I can't drive it enough! Moved from an S80 to the C70 and love the car. Get one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is very comfortable and well constructed. The stereo system is amazing. The convertible top is ingenious. The fit and finish of the vehicle is outstanding. Styling is sleek and mature. The engine power could be classified as peppy. Interior and exterior design is distinctive and elegant.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Top up or down this car is quiet even without the windblocker! The ride is better than the two V6s I have owned in the last 7 years. The center console panel is every 'gadget' persons' best friend!! This is just a WOW car, the lines, the comfort, the style (top up OR down) it is incredible! The back seat is "cushy" (as my 7 y/o son puts it) and the trunk space is substantial even with the top down. Try it, you will love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love to drive my C70, unfortunately, the majority of it seems to be the 50 miles one way to the dealer for the Check Engine light repair. Six times in 7 weeks, less than 5,000 miles on the car. Have a 16 hour road trip in two weeks, wish I had a right arm rest. The center console is positioned for a height of about 6', not my 5'6"</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the top down, and stereo and bluetooth and the way it handles, and the plug-in for my ipod that plays through the stereo.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Volvo and I had concerns about quality prior to my purchase. So far the car has performed well, no visits to the dealership except for routine work The car has a very solid feel and is quiet, not even a rattle. Biggest problem has been getting to drive it! My wife and 3 sons prefer this to our Lexus EX 330 and Acura TL. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It's only been a month or so, but my wife and I love our new C70. Great styling and design, great build quality, and zero initial problems. Sure the engine power is not earth- shaking, but it's plenty adequate. The car handles well, brakes well, looks great, and has lots of distinctive touches. Retractable top is great, the Dynaudio sound is top-of-the-line, and you won't see yourself coming and going, due to the limited volume being built. It truly is two cars in one, and looks as good with the top up as down. It's not an all-out sports car, but rather it's a heck of a stylish, fun, top up/down touring car. That said, it won't be embarrassed in the twisties. Oh yeah - it's safe, too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roof mechanism, the smooth curve of the roof line, the stylish "piano" tail-lights, the "scandinavian Design" interior with stainless "waterfall" console, stainless door sills, and two- tone interior, aggressive-looking yet elegant wheels/tires, Volvo safety features, overall solidness.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great Car! I looked at the BMW 330CI and Audi A4 and the C70 is by far the best! I have the car one week and heads are turning. Ride is smooth and tight, mileage great, and really is two cars in one. Top up or down looks great. No air noise when top down. No regrets!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I thought I was getting a sporty, luxurious convertible; after 2500 miles, it's just a reliable Swedish 4- seater hardtop convertible; Sporty- car is too heavy & the suspension is like my old man's ?92 Buick Park Avenue; acceleration- good; cornering not tight; steering- too loose; also, it looks sporty for a Volvo, but come on, consider your baseline; Luxury- nice overall amenities, but there?s room for improvement (see comments below; also, no sunglass case, for $48K?!); Convertible- definitely an attractive European hardtop convertible with a unique 4 seater feature (it won?t be for long? BMW?s version launches in 07); no buyer?s remorse (yet), but I?m not sure I would repeat my choice</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Convertible hard top; DYNAUDIO option is just AWESOME, like front row seats at a Van Halen concert; simple, elegant, and navigable mid-console panel; minimal blind spots; responsive acceleration; passenger memory seats and mirrors; but no sunglass case in a $48K convertible!!?? COME ON!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The four months that it took for my C70 to arrive from Sweden were well worth it! I've had the car for just over two months now and I absolutely love it. I have the manual, 6-speed. It handles extremely well, and is especially fun on curvy country roads. People stop and watch as the top goes up or down. Fuel economy is better than I expected. It's very comfortable - the bucket seat supports your back and a long road trip is conducted with ease and comfort. And there is genuine room for 2 passengers in the rear seats. Adequate trunk space.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Of course, the hard top is the best feature. But I also like the styling of the center console. The 6-speed manual transmission is great fun!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I ordered this car in September and during the 3 month wait had some second thoughts.Now after two weeks of driving I feel it was a smart choice. It is a pleasure to drive, comfortable, and is elegantly stylish inside and out.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The retractable roof is a marvel. Beyond that I like the road manners, comfortable seating and the Sirius radio. I opted for the base sound system and feel that it is quite good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought my 2007 C70 this past September and the car is simply outstanding! The retractable hardtop-- the signature feature--is a marvel of engineering and truly makes this vehicle 100% versatile--a convertible when I want be sporty, a quiet riding coupe when the top is up, and a nice family car for the four of us on long or short outings. The car is sophisticated but subtle, not drawing unwanted attention and does not scream "mid-life crisis" but is instead a good balance of fun, fashion, performance, practicality, and pride. The engine has plenty of pickup, and the leather interior is luxurious and first-class. All in all, a great car and a real keeper for this enthusiastic owner!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Without a doubt, the retractable hardtop! This feature lives up to its advertising, making the C70 truly akin to owning two cars instead of one! I also like the power seats with shoulder controls (making it easier to move for back-seat passengers) and the Xenon headlights provide great visibility!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The drive is smooth, the back seats roomy enough for groceries but tight for people -- though not so tight as the more expensive kind -- and look is appealing in its lines and styling. One drawback is the accelerator is too close to the brake pedal. Other than this it is a superb auto/convertible.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, a great car for its price. Can't get a hard top that seats 4 from anywhere else. Like the title says, you'll be turning some heads when you lower the top at a signal. It's not built for performance though... looks sporty but really isn't.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I already have 1300 miles on the car and have only had it since 11/30. I have been able to put the roof down twice and have experienced no problems other than my seat belt flapping. I also find the brake pedal to close to the gas pedal, I constantly bump it when moving my foot to the gas pedal. This car is definitely worth the money that I paid for it. I bought the flint gray with off black interior, the combination really looks great. The most annoying problem is getting into the back seat, I just don't like the seats work, would be better if manual.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the turbo and the steering and I know that I will be getting a ticket. I also enjoy not having to put a boot on after you put the roof down.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am coming off a Infiniti G35 Coupe. The Volvo is extremely well built. The car is "tight' and it handles well. The best feature is the hard top convertible. In less than 30 seconds you go from coupe to convertible. Back seats are spacious for a 2 door car. Ample trunk space with top up, not bad with top down. No spare tire. No XM radio option. Standard radio is above average. Interior design is simple and clean.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's my wife's car, but I get to play with it on weekends. Wow what a car, for the price we paid it's worth it. We have a 97 Maxima which has great acceleration, but the C70 takes off like a bat out of hell. The feel is great, have to watch from ending up in someones rearend. The car surprises you as you press on the gas. The car seems to be therapeutic, just get in the car and start driving, and you feel the problems just get left behind. The car is so enjoyable to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The best feature of the car and only because I'm more of an audiofile is the sound system. Feels like your in your den listening to Hi end stereo system. </FAVORITE>

<FAVORITE>Great handling ability and creating a retractable hardtop and room for 4 regular people. I also enjoy the fact that they were able to reduce the exterior sounds when the top is up. </FAVORITE>
