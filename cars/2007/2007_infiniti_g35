<TEXT>This car is a blast to drive and great as a daily commuter as well. Have logged 27K miles and not a single problem thus far. The reliability has been a huge factor. Plenty of room to schlep one or two of the kids around town when needed. Highly recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Push it and it drives like a superb handling muscle car. Cruise and it is smooth luxury!. Tried Lexus, BMW and Mercedes. If you get this car fully loaded with the Tech pkg and it's the perfect blend of them all. I am beyond happy with this car. Gas mileage is a drawback but it has a long list of positive trade offs. Manual Clutch takes some getting used to but is extreme fun once you master it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I dropped my wife off at a wedding, after driving her & 2 friends to the church. There was 4-5 inches of snow already. Cars slipping all over. Not enough time to plow the roads yet. The G35x was AWESOME. Even with wider tires, the g35x's awd and the stability control literally disconnected me from the snowy road. I have a 2000 subaru, and the AWD on that is great. But this car would have blown it away. The G35x is an incredibly competent vehicle. Hands down. It will cruise in great luxury, and will blast ahead of traffic when needed. For sure there are cars that will beat every individual aspect of this car, but as a package, it is impressive as all get out!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've researched a lot of cars and found this to be the best bang for my buck. It is a true sports car, yet a gentleman's car as well. Highway driving is very comfortable. It handles extremely well in autoCross races also, easily beating cars such as the Porche Boxter. My only regret is not buying sooner.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power. Very smooth and quick acceleration. Engine note is wonderful. We tried the Nissan Altima Coupe with 3.5L first and noticed a drastic difference as soon as we sat in the G35. Braking is unbelievably good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second G35X. I loved the first (2004). This car has been even better. I am actually getting better mileage as well. The original Goodyear tires were poor, but a step up from the previous car's horrible original tires. I replaced them with Hankook tires after 29000 miles. No complaints there. I am still on my original brake pads after 41000 miles. I can't believe it, but I have them checked, and they are fine. It might be due to my use of the autostick . This car is a lease, but I will likely purchase it at the end of the lease. I drove the 2009 with the 7 speed auto and 328 horsepower. There was no real difference. The Bose premium "studio on wheels" sounds great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great drive. Fast, fun and handles well. I like it better than my friend's Jaguar XK. Although he gets more stares. The sound system is incredible. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a beautiful and powerful (306 horsepower) car. However, it is a sport edition which means different sized tires. This is a nightmare. Not only are the tires expensive, but I am on my third (yes, I said third set) and I only have 40K on the car. Also, the gas mileage is horrible. It averages about 14-16mpg. Terrible!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is very fast and it looks great in black. The sports seats are very tight. I'm waist size 32. This car can be much more efficient if the top gear is much taller. Unless you're living in a very hilly city, there is no reason to have the RPM above 3K at 70 mph. It feels very wasteful, and it is very wasteful. Another major problem are the tires. The front tires start to feather out and make a lot of noise at around 10K. I had to replace them even though they still have a lot of tread. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have 26,000 miles on my G35 and need to put the third set of tires on the rear. I have been told that because of the difference in the tire size (front & rear) that rear tires seldom last for more than 10,000 - 12,000 miles. Wish someone had told me this prior to purchasing! Definitely will NOT purchase another G35.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been driving this car for approx 3 months now and I still catch myself smiling each time I enter the car. I was actually set on buying the 335i, but decided to test drive the '07 6mt before making a final decision. Unlike the very industrial look of the Bimmer's interior, the G had that sense of warmness that I didn't really feel in the other cars I tested (IS 350, TL type S, A4, S4). Besides the IS 350 and 335i, the G simply trumps its competition when it comes to delivering raw power. I didn't think I could love the car anymore. That is until I started modding the car. So far... exhaust, upgraded springs/shocks, 20" wheels... and much more to come.</TEXT>

<TEXT>WOW, Someone please pinch me. I test drove the Lexus GS 350, Acura TL, and BMW 328i and none compare to the Infiniti G35.

<TEXT>Tons of research of the usual culprits, just couldn't justify the extra $15k for BMW cachet. I got the Premium package. Excellent value. Great torque and HP. Need to be light on the pedal because she really wants to run. Beautiful interior with loads of great features standard (bluetooth, sun roof, incredible sound system, etc.).

<TEXT>I have been researching new cars for over a year and the G35X was a last minute choice. I originally looked at Lincoln MKZ, Lexus IS250, Cadillac CTS & BMW 325. But I have to say I'm absolutely in love with this car. It moves like the wind and is a joy to drive. The only issue I have so far is getting the HomeLink system to work with my garage door opener but that's a minor problem when compared with the exceptional performance of this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Straight up performance w/luxury and technology! Some may not be ready for the new G35 sedan. Only the few owners of this car can relate. A heavy foot can get you in trouble if you're not careful. It will unleash a plethora of power and unlike the rest of the class. Infiniti comes standard w/306 hp. The G35 Sport is specifically designed w/a limited-slip differential for improved traction under acceleration and larger disc brakes & redesigned calipers for better stopping power. Additional cost for luxury & convenience is very reasonable and with all the toys, it is still a lot cheaper than other cars in it's class. Also, you get the credible repuation of Infiniti's reliability & safety</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty & luxurious feel, powerful torque, interior w/large standard 7" LCD display for audio, climate, fuel mileage, maintenance,comfort & convenience controls.

<TEXT>Overall the 07 G35 Sedan is a superb car. Excellent power and handling and the best brakes in its class. Technology and styling make this car practical and functional. Sold a '03 Mercedes Benz CLK500 and the G35 outperforms it. BMW 335i still holds the benchmark for this class but the G35 is a better value. Cannot justify paying $10k more for a similar performing car with less room and options. Disappointing gas mileage, no better than the V-8 Mercedes. EPA of 19 & 26 is a laugh. I haven't had mileage on averaage higher than 19 during the four months I've had the car. Also had some issues with the voice controls for audio and phone. Fantastic car but not perfect.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Leased a '07 G35 Auto Journey w/sunroof & wheels/tires package. Great car for the $$. Fun, classy & just enough room for us & our 2 yr. old... Didn't want to pay for Premium package since I didn't care for fancy Bose, homelink, MP3 player, memory seats + steering & mirrors, auto-lumber support, dimming mirror or bluetooth. But wished it had heated seats, so I opted for the stand alone sunroof + wheels/tires since the G35 Sports rode a little harsh & Journey more suited for us w/the toddler. This car is very very fast (I came from a Subaru Forester XT which was a total sleeper) and wants to go all the time. Handles extremely well and interior is comfy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>That says it all. I have owned this car a week.This car turns heads, more than my BMW528i, then snaps their necks as they watch it disappear. Unbelievably fast, it will challenge you to keep up with it. I bought mine loaded with Tech, Nav and Premium with Rosewood Trim. Love the stereo, Nav, Voice Rec. This car is a true pleasure to drive. I am always looking for excuses to go for a drive. Test drove the Acura TL- S, the BMW330i. The Infinity hands down outperforms them and doesn't look like everyone else on the road. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the Nav, just learning it will keep me busy for awhile, the Nav manual is almost as big as the owners manual! Love the engine, the autorev on downshift and the way it doesn't "shift out from under you" as you lift for a turn!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It is a no brainer. Research and test drive the Lexus, BMW, Mercedes etc. Compare their options, price and driving experience with the Infiniti G35. BMW and Mercedes charge lots more for their cars and they have fewer features (unless you want to pay even more money to them). The BMW and Mercedes only have a single CD player and they have no hard drive record feature like the Infiniti. Infiniti is the clear choice this year. I have driven mine for 5000 miles now and it is absolute perfection. I have driven it hard through corners and up to 145 mph. The car handles perfectly under all conditions. You cannot compare the other cars and the price without saying that Infiniti is the best of all</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is a lot of fun to drive. Hit the gas and the car moves. I love the sound of the engine as the RMPs climb. The technology is integrated very well. I have all the packages and it is going to take awhile to get up to speed on all the car's capabilities. The road feel is excellent, much better than the comparable Lexus. The back seat area could use more room but my teenage boys love riding in the car so much they don't mind the lack of foot space. This car replaced by Audi A6 and is much more fun to drive. I liked the all wheel drive of the Audi so much I go it on the G35 as well. Need to wait for some snow to see how it does.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I think the Infiniti G is a great value play considering the performance and initial quality. More than anything, new Infiniti buyers will enjoy a very entertaining driving experience. This is a fast car that holds the road nicely. I spent a lot of time driving a Journey with 17 inch wheels prior to purchase, but decided to add the performance tire and wheel package. I think the car has a more refined and quieter ride at highway speeds on the 18 inch Bridgestone tires. The drawback is that the 18" tires can not be rotated like the 17's.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a black G35 sedan from Infiniti of Chantilly. Got the works. Although the stereo isn't digital surround, it still was the best in class. great tech features, good bass, hard drive to store all your cd's. The car gets fast, quick. Feels like 40 when you're doing 70. Bought the active steer, suspn.'s a little stiffer, but it handles great. Nav is decent, back up cam had better features than others'. Still haven't used the Intell. Cruise Control, but it's too much fun to drive. Was initially leaning towards a Type-S, but the feel of RWD and the Studio on Wheels sealed the deal. </TEXT>

The bmw was just an overall nicer car. I guess you get what ya pay for. The g35 also has hard seats and loves to burn fuel. I get about 15-16 mpg around town. The g35 doesn't handle as well as a bmw in high winds or at high speeds. It gets loose in the turns at high speeds. Sure hope gas prices don't climb again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the G35 AWD with Premium Pkg, Nav Pkg, Tech Pkg, Rosewood interior, and Splash-guards. The car is awesome. Smooth, powerful drive-train, nice trans (5-spd but that's all you need), tiptronic works great, bluetooth sync'd with no problem to a Sprint Sanyo Katana, excellent sound system, back-up camera is nice to have. Highly recommend the Rosewood interior; without it cheapens the interior. Looked at the the Lexus: IS250, ES350 & GS350 as well as the Acura TL. Evaluating the Infiniti was almost an after-thought. But, for the money and driving experience, the 07 G35 is the standard to beat right now in this class (maybe any class). If looking for a driving experience; look no further.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is absolutely fantastic. it's fit and Finish are stellar, the 4 wheel active steer is amazing and if your ordering a car, don't skip this option! The handling is stellar, the power of this car is actually dangerous for most people.. I wish it had a way to cut the power in 1/2 for valets and the wife :) If you're looking for the king of performance it's either the G35S or the BMW 335i for ($11K more) but I don't see $11K in extra value out of the 335i. The TL is not in the same performance league and the IS350 falls quite short on handling and driver feedback.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This G has real power and you can feel it on all levels. Gives you that great sound of the engine too without being annoying. Coming off a BMW 330; the G is just as good in terms of performance at a much lower cost. Also gets a lot of attention because of its awesome looks/exterior design. Nice space inside and not tight at all in the back seats, unlike others in the segment.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for 2 weeks now and I'm ecstatic over it's head-turning styling and jaw-dropping power. This G35 is the very best in this price range and is far superior, in my opinion, to the BMW 3 series and the Lexus I350. And at a much lower price too! Great, solid feel to the entire machine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a 2002 Passat & wanted to upgrade by buying a new car. Drove several cars like the Lexis IS 250, Acura TL, BMW 325 and others. Then I took out the Infiniti 35X & bought it. It's been almost a month and I can tell you that it's a great car. It has a lot of power, luxury and beauty. The only negative I can think of is that the fuel economy is OK - not great. But, everything else about the car is really ideal. Before buying any other luxury car take the G35X for a ride, I think that you will decide what I decided and buy it. Good luck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The good: Drives awesome and the stereo rocks. Very comfortable seats and well put together. The bad: 6 days after taking delivery discovered a paint flaw in three doors (looks like someone ran their fingers under the clear coat and left a "wax residue" the size of a hand). Manufacturer acknowledges it was a factory defect but is only willing to re-paint all doors, plus part of the front and rear quarter will need to be repainted. BBB says I have no case under Lemon Laws. The car is silver which is a difficult color to match. The manufacturer may be following the law by only offering to re-paint but is it really fair to force a client to accept a repainted new car? In my opinion no.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a G35 S 6MT with the premium package. The performance is awesome. I've driven Volvo S60R, BMW 330i, Audi A4(3.0 and 2.0 T) and this is the most impressive engine. Best selling point was when salesmen let me test drive alone and left traction control off by accident. Car almost went sideways on dry pavement shifting to second with an automatic. Was concerned about its traction control until I found out traction control was off. I later drove a manual with it on. I can say this is the fastest car I've ever driven and blows BMW and Audi away unless you pay the extra 30-40K for Audi S-4, RS-4, or BMW M3. Premium is worth it for the awesome bose studio on wheels and the bluetooth</TEXT>

<TEXT>The new G35 is solid ride and very well built. I'm replacing a 2005 Acura TL which was a rattling piece of junk. There is a world of difference and not for much more money. The style exterior and interior is great much better than the previous G35. It's very, very fast and fun to drive. If you want one of these cars, get at least the premium and tech packages and the wood package is neat also. The seats are stiff and fairly average size - not made for a large person! It's simply a great value for the money and hopefully be great quality and a great alternative to Acura who I feel is slipping in quality. </TEXT>

It is a beautiful car with tons of power and luxury. I got black on black and it looks awesome. Although I have always loved the BMW I just see way too many on the road and the design looks stale to me. Good job infiniti - you have made a huge leap and I bet will sell a ton of the these cars!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the G35x with premium and navigation package (Ponied for the xm radio and xm nav which is a must in the city). In any case, I couldn't be more pleased with this car. Rapid, smooth acceleration throughout the power curve, responsive suspension, really, really a blast to drive. I spent the whole first day with a big grin on my face. Interior and exterior, the styling is just first rate. I went with the black leather interior which against the aluminum trim is beautiful. Mileage for me the first couple of tanks is around 16 mpg, but I'm driving it fairly hard. The acceleration pop of this sedan is remarkable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I went with a 6MT coupe. The car turns lots of heads and looks more expensive than it is. I constantly see people looking at the car and many say it looks like a Porsche. I considered a BMW 328 or 335 coupe, but I liked this car more than the 328 and it was about $7500 less than a comparable 335. My last two cars were BMWs, but the ones just don't impress me. The Aero Package really changes the look of the car for the better. The front seats are very comfortable for people who aren't overweight. The interior has lots of nice details and storage compartments. The car has plenty of power and handles as well as a BMW, although it's terrible in snow. Gas mileage has been around 24 mpg.</TEXT>

Tried and true, mechanically these cars are bullet proof. The AWD keeps you where you're going, and 0-60 in 5.2 is no joke.

<TEXT>The new G is fast, and handles great. The Sport model suspension is firm without being harsh, and the paddle shifters for the 5AT are excellent. Inside all of the amenities are within easy reach, and the layout (especially the gauges) is outstanding. Sport seats are comfortable, and hold you snugly through any maneuver :-) The trunk space is pretty limited, and the rear seats don't fold down :-(, so there's room for even large suitcases, but not wide items. Fuel economy is pretty dismal, but to be fair I drive it in manual shift mode all the time, and rarely shift up to 5th except on the highway. Great car, great price, I'm delighted.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First of all, before I begin my review I have to confess that this is my first "luxury sport" purchase. I drove a Saturn prior to buying this car and man it was like a quantum jump onto another planet of driving. Before I purchased this vehicle, I test drove the BMW 330i and Audi A4/S4. For the price, this car just absolutely rocks. If you are a spirited driver and don't mind the 6-speed, I definitely recommend it. Infiniti has revised the interior to be much more pampering, somewhat comparable to a Lexus. I got the Sport 6MT with the premium package (major perk is that it adds the Bose Surround Sound System). Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought first Infiniti after driving all comparable entry level luxury sedans. Expected to purchase new Lexus ES350,IS350,BMW 3-series or Accura TL. The new G35 addressed former interior design flaws with clean, upscale, functional controls. Seats comfortable and leather and trim match any car in class. The car stands out, however, in exterior styling and performance. It is truly a head- turner and I've actually grown tired of telling strangers what type of car it is...most believe it would cost $40- $50K. 306 hp rear-wheel drive in Journey model is responsive with a throaty sound better than competitors. Only the BMW 3 models compare in class and are not worth the extra $5-8K. Safe buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just picked up my 2007 G35 Sport Sedan (Auto) last weekend and have been loving it since I drove it off the lot. The other cars that I evaluated in my purchasing process were the Lexus IS350, Audi 3.2 A4, and the BMW 335. The G holds it own with all and surpasses them in many ways, most notably price, performance, and driving experience. Considering that each of the aforementioned models are at least 3k more in price I don?t see how one could justify such a premium. Interior and exterior styling is truly outstanding and the sport model is flat out ?tight?. An outstanding automobile!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned my new G for 1 month (my family also has a '97 Maxima (102k mi) and '95 240SX (170k mi)). The new G has classy (mature but not boring) styling, a quality interior (with good rear legroom), gobs of power, a great exhaust note, and it corners like it's on rails. Plus, the Studio on Wheels, easy-to-use dashboard controller, and the quality leather are noteworthy. The auto in Sport mode is amazing! Fit and finish are excellent and everything about the car has a solid feel. I highly recommend it. I had also checked out the 3-series (poor rear legroom, mediocre styling, expensive), Lexus IS (SMALL interior, unappealing styling). The wrong-wheel drive TL was not in the running.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just bought the car 5 days ago. The power is intoxicating to say the least! Brakes are great. The interior is so much nicer than the 2006 model. The seats have good side bolsters for those spirited backroad jaunts. The fuel mileage is pretty poor at 18 mph average so far. Hopefully it goes up a few more points after break-in period. The ride is similar to the BMW 325is coupe I had a few years back, sporty but not too bumpy. Haven't driven in the snow yet, but I assume the all-wheel drive and the narrower 17 inch tires should be ok. Once the snow is gone, this car will get a set of 18 inch sport wheels and tires. I think the Boxster will stay in the garage until spring!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, this is an excellent car, but you have to accept certain Saab-ish or Subaru-ish quirks that come with it. Can not complain about the shift linkage, handling, acceleration, or comfort. The quirks I mentioned include things like memory seats. Yes, the seat will move to the predetermined position, as will the steering wheel, but the side view mirrors will remain still. Also, here are RCA jacks for an MP3 player in the center arm rest compartment, but there is no integrated charger or mount for the iPod. The car also does not have daytime running lights. Overall, these are small gripes and the money saved over a MB, Audi, or BMW is well worth the minor inconveniences. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove the BMW335i, Lexus IS350, and Acura TL Type-S. Very respectable competitors with loads to offer, but... BMW shifts were rubbery, and a 10k prestige premium didn?t feel justified, especially considering reliability and repair cost. Lexus 350i was elegant inside but handling spongy. TypeS was the closest competitor for me, comparably equipped for the same price. High quality 2- tone leather, carbon fiber trim. Handled well overall, but short 20 hp and FWD just falls short of RWD kick. The G35 Sport was crisp, responsive, refined inside and out. Drove both 5A w/paddles (nifty) and 6MT (nicer!). My wife smiled as she left the 5A driver?s seat, ?I see why you like this car, wow!?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I first test drove the BMW 328XI and was impressed with its driving, handling, and exterior appearance. However, the interior of the vehicle was a disappointment. For a vehicle well over 40 grand the interior should be eye catching as well. Later that day I test drove the 07 Infiniti G35x which to me handled just as well as the BMW. The exterior of the Infiniti is just as impressive as the interior. I purchased it fully loaded for just over 40k. I got it in black with beige leather which I receive compliments all the time. BMW should take a lessons from Infiniti on interior. There is no comparison between the two. The 3.5L V6 (306 hp), blows BMW(230hp) away. BMW is in my rear view mirror. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I previously owned a 2005 G35 6MT. The 2007 G35 Sport is more luxurious and powerful. The handling seems ever so slightly less agile, but the overall refinement of the car is obvious in every way. Interior design is now more in line with competitive cars.

<TEXT>Move over BMW 3 series. There is a new winner in that segment that costs thousands less. I drove both the BMW 335 and 328 sedans, Audi A4, Acura TL, Lexus IS (both models) and none compared to the new G35 sedan. Although BMW's steering was more precise and Infiniti has not mastered 0 body roll when making sharp turns, the G35 kills the BMW 3 series and its competitors in every other segment, and again, it's much cheaper. It offers more horsepower then the BMW and the interior is not cheesy looking at all as it is on the BMW. It offers quality and reliability as does Acura and Lexus but still has a sporty feel to it unlike Lexus. Summary: Move over BMW 3 series, there is a new winner!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my '07 g35 sport automatic for about 3 weeks now. I cannot believe how exciting it is to drive! From a technology and performance standpoint, there is no other car that can touch it in this class. You currently cannot even buy a BMW 3 series (at any price) that comes with as many options as this car straight from the factory. The car is definitely as fast as it looks. If you want fuel economy, look elsewhere. Hopefully you don't think scorching acceleration should offer 30 mpg. I'm getting 18 mpg in the city and around 21 mpg on the highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove BMW, Lexus and other cars before buying the G35. For handling, feel, options, and pleasure, the G35 came out on top. For the price with all options, the G35 came out on top. A minor trade off is that the gas mileage is not as good as a BMW or a Lexus. For quality of workmanship, warranty and pure pleasure to drive, I do not think that any other car can compete with the G35 for the same price. It is a true sports car disguised as a family car. It does take a while to learn how to operate the technology, but I find that to be a welcome challenge that keeps me from getting bored on long drives. The navigation system is very user friendly and accurate. This is the ultimate car</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2006 GS35 for the 2007 GS35 and let me tell you that so far it is worth every penny. There are significant differences when comparing the two. First and foremost, the power. The engine is powerful and smooth. You don't hear as bumps in the road as in the 2006. You have to watch the speedometer because getting up to 100 is easy. The interior quality definitely has improved significantly as well. If you want a fun car and reliable car to drive, this is it. Only regret is that I didn't hold off long enough to get this car first. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love driving again. I was a prev. Infiniti owner. I like the reliability, quality & style that the brand carries. I wasn?t that thrilled with the seats & dash on the '06 model, but the '07 is different. The ?07 G35 is stylish, powerful & well proportioned. The cockpit holds you like a pilot: steering wheel is powered & telescoping; seats move back to let you out; push button start; LED screen nicely controls navigation, radio and more. The nav. shows bodies of water, airports, restaurants & gas stations. the steering is tight & it has good shocks. The car does jump a little when stepping on the gas which kills gas mileage but it's worth it</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Spend money for the tech package. Adaptive headlights illuminate the area really well at night. Once you try it, you won?t want a car w/o them. Also, the CD burner is superb!

<TEXT>This car is a great value for the money. It combines performance + technology well just like BMW. I previously test drove the Lexus IS250 AWD and decided to go with this car because it had more rear legroom. Head to head it is a better match up with the IS350. I got it with the Premium package and Nav. I love the Compact Flash slot up front because you can use it to play your mp3s and wmas. You can also store your songs on the 9.5 GB hard drive. Very few cars out now have both these features. You don't even need CDs. The Nav can be used with voice or touch screen. You can also watch DVDs on the same screen if you hookup a video player like a Video Ipod or Zune !</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was debating between the G35 and the BMW 335i coupe. I test drove both and both are great cars. The BMW engine is a bit more refined and the manual shifting seemed more effortless. But the G35 Sport provides 95% of what BMW can offer and is $8000 less comparably equipped. The G35 interior is top notch. The BMW interior is more industrial looking in an 'Ikea' sorta way. I chose the G35 Sport because it is stylish, powerful, well appointed, and won't give me headaches once the warranty is over. I have no regrets purchasing this car, but wonder if I should have waited one more year for the redesigned 2008 G35 coupe....Well done Infiniti!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Not as refined of an engine/transmission nor as surgical in handling as a BMW 3 Series, but the new G35 sedan is the only Japanese sport sedan that comes pretty darn close. The sport level edges the gap even closer, which gives you rear wheel assisted turning. With superior integration of technology and a much improved interior from its predecessor it is difficult to find fault in this car. In comparison, the IS350 has a stuffier interior and a softer ride, much less sportier. The BMW 3 Series is much pricier and has questionable long term reliability. This car is the perfect median when it comes to Japanese value and reliability vs German performance and refinement.</TEXT>

Everything about the car is beautiful from the curvy lines (yes, you can really tell the difference between the 06 and 07 WHEN they are near each other - the 07 is far more elegant) to the luxurious interior. Infiniti has a car that performs like a BMW yet is as luxurious as a Lexus - all for $5 - $10K less than those guys. It's an incredible value. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2006 Audi A4 3.2l was recently totaled. The new G35 was worth the wait. Interior and exterior quality of this car are superb and a significant improvement from the 2006 model. I was concerned that this vehicle would be a cheap "substitute" for the BMW or not live up to my Audi. NOT! In my opinion THIS car has now set the new standard, especially considering the outstanding features and cheaper price. This car is now unmatched: Fun to drive, great power, reliability, luxurious interior, tech options, AND less expensive... Negatives? While I personally would rank overall performance of the G35 best in the class, I would still rank steering precision 2nd to BMW. Fuel economy is so-so.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is beautiful to look at but not beautiful to drive! Overall it is a fun car with very high performance limits. However it has a slightly unsophisticated feel to it - in the clutch and suspension feel and the acceleration is not linear. The brakes are awesome. The rear axle tends to hop with wheel spin which is a letdown. If you don't spin the tires acceleration is top notch. Anything above 8/10s level the car feels flawless. It is in normal day to day driving, particularly the daily work slog, that it can be tedious to drive. Again, for the money this car in pretty much in it's own league.

<TEXT>Just having sold my G35 sport finds me missing this car, not at all. I truly believed this was a fantastic built and designed sports sedan. Having downscaled due to $ concerns, I don't really miss it especially when it rains, for (2) reasons. The HP is enormous and fast acceleration on a rain slick surface spins you out and secondly, after you park in your garage, notice all the water falling from the wheel well and gathering around each wheel. If you have a flat surfaced garage, expect to mop up 8 towels worth of water off the floor. Apparently, the trim panels collect the road splash and slow drip when parked. Add to that a look-alike Nissan styling for $10k less.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Don't believe all the hype folks. I admit that I was also fooled by the sticker in the window. 19/25 MPG. Never happened!!! It gets more like 14/17 MPG. Had to return it on numerous occasions concerning the transmission slipping, and the car trying to over heating on me, excessive water in the head lamps. I have to take it back today for more work. Great price for all you get but it's not worth the headaches in the long run.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Be informed Infiniti provides a list of compatible phones that will work with the G35 on their website. The selection of cellphones is poor and when infiniti was contacted they could not explain how they would keep in pace with new cell phone offerings amongst the various carriers. I was not informed of this prior to purchase and have found it to be a disappointment, due to the fact my freedom of choice in selecting a cellphone has been eliminated.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Infiniti falls short in so many areas. The controls are a foot away from the display for what you're changing (A/C, stereo), the A/C controls are non-intuitive. Bumper paint doesn't match. Dash lights don't match. Body and trim panels vary in fit. Front sport seats are too tight for an average (180 lb) adult. Bad clutch - in for recall today. Cheap floor mats are almost worn out! 14 bolts/plastic cover to replace oil filter and change oil. Front chrome grill easy to chip. Moon roof trim falls out. Redundant service disply in console and in dash. Cheap analog clock should be digital for quick read. Leather not as soft as previous year. Little storage in cabin. Stereo FM separation very poor.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had to part ways with my G35x. The car is great but the power is unbalanced for the handling and weight of the vehicle. Watch out for the MPG. Averaging 20, doing good to get 22 on the highway. The G needs a 6th or 7th gear. 3000+ RPM at 70-75 mph on the highway is poor engineering. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Love that G!! Extras certainly pay off. If you have the means, I suggest the Infiniti cold air intake system with Stillen exhaust upgrades. Purrs like cougar! The car growls upon acceleration. The Billet grill is definitely an eye catcher and I get many double takes. All in all, a well thought out car, with smart perks, easy on the eyes interior design, auto up-down windows, quiet and roomy interior (and I'm 6 foot), smart key, great seats, smooth ride, fantastic cornering, and great acceleration and stopping power. Granted I have some extras on the vehicle which help, but the bottom line, I smoked my friend's M3. I am Infiniti. Hear me roar!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 6 months of use, the car's pros and cons become more obvious. Love the power, handling and braking with an excellent turning circle. Driving over wet leaves, the 4WD system is flawless and solid. The ride comfort is excellent for a sporty sedan of this size. Acceleration is too touchy at standing start and the manual mode auto does have quirks: 3rd gear is abrupt up and down; can't seem to figure out how the speed sensing wipers work (maybe they don't); the non-navi LCD screen could have been put to even better more extensive use for driver info.</TEXT>

Navigation is great, real time XM traffic will change the way you drive and the built in hard drive is a killer feature.

<TEXT>I was intrigued when my local Infiniti service staff started to buzz about the 2007 G35 sedan. I needed more sport in my life after several years in an I35. I got it. This car is a category killer. I bought the G35 Sport w/5 speed auto and most techo options. It's blistering fast, has great handling (stable at any speed and extremely nimble), and has top class braking. It's very tractable around town in D - shift the manumatic for yourself, and it's show time. The nav system is top notch and the 10Gb music hard drive stores 500 CDs. Unlike some I like its looks just fine. Very modern in the Japanese idiom. Downs: stiff "sport" seats, poor mileage. But for $40K you can't do better than this.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, handling, braking, 5 speed manumatic w/algorithmic learning in sport mode, 18" wheels w/ Z rubber, solid construction, modern good looks, excellent nav and music systems, Bluetooth phone link, dash and seat materials, long wheelbase = better rear passenger space and trunk space for class.</FAVORITE>

I am happy to say that I received much more than I anticipated. The styling is classy, the quality is impeccable and the power this car delivers is "infinitely" beyond my expectation. The G has an impressive center of gravity that makes the car stick to the road in the corners. I love all the techno gadgets as well including the nav and hard drive for storing my music on board.

<TEXT>Hung on to my Honda Accord V6 Coupe for as long as possible (wife, 2 small kids and an SUV). I was looking for a 4-dr sports sedan that offered sportiness, luxury, and room for 4. I set my sights on the G35x as well as the BMW3. Once I had a look at the new lines and interior of the 2007 G and took it for a test drive a clear winner was declared. The G35 offered nearly everything that the BMW 3s had with better reliability and for way less money - performance and value!! After 10 months, and 15,000 mi. I just can't say enough good things about this car - I'm too busy driving it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We know the good points. My 6MT is in Lakeshore Slate and I was stuck with the black dash. The bumper paint is shades off from the body panels. The moonroof trim pieces keep falling in. The Washi katana trim in the door differs a shade from that in front of the passenger. The passenger seatbelt receiver is uncomfortably high for riders. The nav/radio console is trimmed in bright silver but other pieces are matte or brushed nickel, looking as if designed for a different car. The purple dash accent lighting differs from gauges to knob highlight rings. After a rain, opening the trunk lets water pour in from the perimeter of the lid. The carpet is a loose warpy fit in back. Mats are cheap, thin.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did tons of research on competing cars from BMW, Lexus, etc. None matched the G35 for looks, reliability, and quality for the price. The car is a blast to drive and very comfortable on long trips. Edmunds Consumers' and Editors' favorite coupe says it all. Granted, gas mileage suffers, but the power of the engine is stunning - when you punch it, hang on, and I mean, hang on tight. One more thing - it gets lots of attention. Want to get noticed?

<TEXT>Very happy so far with my new G35. Decided on a Journey model with Premium package and Performance wheel upgrades - concerned about the "firm ride" reviews from Sport model drivers. I traded in my Lexus coupe for a more practical sedan that could fit more than two passengers and was still fun to drive. I previously drove a BMW coupe and was unimpressed by multiple minor problems though thought it was fun to drive. I basically limited my choices to the Lexus IS 350 and the Infiniti G35, and it was a close call. Lexus is more refined and reliable (based on experience), but the Infiniti was more fun to drive and thousands less, so I figured I'd give it chance. Happy so far!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I also own a G35 coupe and the sedan is every bit as pleasurable and performing. The 4 wheel drive finally got my wife out of an SUV and in hard rains it's been extremely stable and predictable. I'm getting 22.9 to 23.5 mpg on the road and about 19 to 19.5 around town. I'm glad I bought the tech package as the laser cruise control when there are 3 or more lanes is a very nice feature. I don't and would not recommend using it on busy 2 lane interstates. Three things I don't like. When the wipers go on you have to manually turn the lights on. No automatic door locks once car is put in drive. The CD box in the trunk is a pain and makes loading luggage a chore and limits space. Get rid of it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I upgraded to the G35 Sport from a rather outdated Oldsmobile, so I was immediately impressed by the handling, power, and comfort. Not only is the car stylish, it can stand on its own when it comes to performance. The touchscreen GPS and bluetooth are great features that make driving much more convenient. Also, you have about 5 different methods to play music through the car, including the flash drive, in-dash hardrive, 6 cd changer, in-dash player, and the RCA jacks in the center armrest. Gas mileage ranges from 16 mpg in busy city streets, to about 27 mpg on open freeway at 75-80 mph.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Aside from its sexy looks, the GPS nav system, voice recognition, bluetooth for your phone, and XM satellite traffic info are incredible.

The car is tight, and ride is firm but not harsh, the seats are excellent, very comfortable front or back. I put two golf bags in the trunk (they just fit) along with a few other things.

I was looking for something a little sportier than my Lexus E330, but, since I drive a lot, I also wanted a more comfortable ride than what a typical sports coupe had to offer. This car delivers the best of both worlds, delivering a quiet, comfortable ride even with the "sports" suspension, while being responsive and powerful enough to provide the fun and excitement of a sports car. And, by the way, very reasonably priced when compared to BMW, the Lexus G series, and other competitors in this class. Highly recommended.</TEXT>

Test drives and now ownership confirm my research. The 6MT Sport Sedan provides ready power, a stable, sure and agile ride combined with a gently sloping, sexy upscale interior, large fuel capacity and best trunk size in its class. Six speed manual transmission has a longish clutch that takes a bit of an adjustment - about two days in my case. The short throw shifter is crisp and decisive.

<TEXT>Previous owner of an Audi A4. This car is everything I thought the Audi would be in performance and handling. If driven 75 on the highway it will get over 27 mpg with premium gas. With mid-grade I get 25+ in mixed driving (up/down a 2300 ft elev. canyon every day and 70-135 mph on a road trip to MT). I usually drive at 4000-6000 ft elevation. There are a few things that could be improved though. The throttle really closes when you take your foot off the gas. Good for performance driving, but annoying when you have the cruise on or are going downhill. Clutch is a bit touchy. The inside of the trunk lid is painted, but not clear coated. Looks cheap even though most people won't see it. </TEXT>

Maybe because my last car had the sport package. I enjoyed the exhaust note on the '03 better. Got my '07 with all the options for under 37k. Test drove the Acura TL Type S, not bad but nowhere near the luxury or refinement of the G. The 330i was just too expensive with all the options. So far I'm really enjoying this car. If I could just learn how to use all the toys!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Acceleration, bluetooth, voice command and back-up camera. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I started looking around and I narrowed my choices down to the Acura TL S-Type, Lexus IS 350, BMW 330i and the G35. I am an avid lover of the BMW, the Acura would have been my second choice, however the G35 was what my heart told me to follow and I have not looked back since. There is nothing bad I could find to say about the G35. I ended up getting a black G with tan interior. The 9.5 gig hard drive to download music to the car just blew me away. I have owned about 10 cars in my life and driven several others and nothing in or near the G35's class can compare to the performance and handling of this vehicle. Infiniti has upped the ante - can any other automobile step up to the challenge?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Where do I start? The 9.5 gigabyte hard drive for downloading music, the well placed look and ease of use on all interior amenities, look of the exterior (mine is black), the ease of use of the Bluetooth technology and all of the amenities that came with the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Compared all of the competition: Acura TL, Cadillac CTS, BMW 328xi, Lincoln MKZ: no comparison for the money. Great handling, instant response and power, all-wheel drive on demand, simple luxurious interior, superior braking, terrific 10 speaker Bose sound system, and fanastic looks (black on grey (slate) leather). Got the Premium package w/o NAVI. It has all the toys you could need. Just getting to the initial break-in, the car is a "rocket" and solidly planted. Real fun to drive with the 5 speed auto with sport mode and manual shifting. Great turning circle, no torque steer, and if you manually shift, hold on!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine smoothness and response, steering and handling, firm but supple and controlled ride, AWD, Sound system, and looks of the car (a head turner).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was previously a Lexus owner for the past 7 years. Decided to go with the sleek body of an Infiniti G35. Within two months, began experiencing ignition problems - would sputter and die on cold starts. Dealer worked on it for two weeks before it replaced ECM. Problems are back a month later. Infiniti refuses to replace vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>none. lost confidence in new vehicle that can't start cold on first try</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The lease on my 2005 Audi A4 was coming due in a couple of months, so I decided to get an early start on car shopping. Looked at the 2007 Audi A4 3.2 but also stopped at Infiniti to check out the new G35 because I liked the new body style. As soon as I got behind the wheel. It was a no brainer. More power than the Audi and a plusher interior. Couldn't wait until my lease on the Audi was over, so worked out a great deal to get into the G35x. Opted for the Premium package and so far so good. Can't get enough!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Hands free Bluetooth is great, just takes some time to program your numbers. Interior is great, powerful engine and exterior design. More front and rear leg room than the Audi.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In my 20s and single, drove a 1994 300ZX manual, decked out leather. Now that it's been 10+ years and I am 32, my tastes and styles have hopefully improved. My thirst for flat out, eye watering performance has only grown. My wife's toyota solara V6 was growing long in the tooth. As we looked for a new car, nothing made her really get excited, no matter the manufacturer or price range. I had shown her the Infiniti website and we were off to go find one. Once she saw the car and went for a spin. She loved it, I loved it. The car has intense performance and a refined style that seperates it from the cookie cutter Lexus and BMW set. If there is any question of safety and traction, go AWD.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD is automatic much like limited slip differentials except forward to backward. Can be locked in for snow. Opted for the African Rosewood trim, worth every penny at $450. Its real, solid wood and takes the interior with wheat leather far beyond BMW. Audio cannot be described. Must be heard.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Was going to get the 6 speed but living in New England I thought better. Car has everything one would want in a high end auto but the price. Blue Slate on black looks sharp. Navi, and premium package were all I needed but tech package for 1000 more seems like a real deal. Car has 110 miles on it, can't wait to open her up after break-in period. Wish it had standard back up sensors because the car is wide and rear is high. The inside of the car is exact carbon copy of the M35/M45. Reason I bought the car, well, it's AWD, has all the toys and can run with anything under 40k.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nissan V6 306 hp, price, comfort, AWD, and technology - huge step up from my 2003 Jetta GLI. More value then Audi, Lexus, BMW.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did my due diligence before buying my G. I have had a couple of 5 series 5 speeds and just felt that BMW was living of their name more than advancing their car. Test drove the TL 6 speed and did not like the handling or the stereo. Lexus has nothing to offer in the 6 speed (is250?). I test drove the G35 and it was an easy decision. This car has it all - luxury, power, handling, looks, reliability, power, GREAT sound from the premium package and did I say power. I have an I30 5 speed going on 150K miles that I have only put brakes on once. These cars are really made well. This is a no brainer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Was an Acura man. Compared the G against Acura TL Type S. You get more car with the Infiniti. Got through a Maine winter with no difficulty. G35x model the way to go if you get any snow/ice. Step on the gas and you'll get thrown deep into the seat. Great cornering abilities too, I haven't been able to throw it loose from a turn. Phenomenal. Couple issues though: audio system is not straightforward, MP3 cds can only be run in-dash player, voice navigation takes some practice (spend an hour actually programming it to recognize YOUR voice), cheap lining for sunroof breaks free too easily, drinks its 93 octane like a frat boy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Accelerates like a rocket both from zero and highway passing. Definitely get a radar detector! Corners like on rails. Four wheel drive is excellent in the snow. GPS very good. Sound quality great. AWESOME exhaust note.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In 2004, I leased a G35. I had 11 nagging reasons NOT to like this car, in spite of Motor Trend and everyone else. These were poor sound, outside mirrors, gas mileage, seats, etc. In 2007, for financial reasons, I leased a new one. There is NO comparison. The 2007 G35 is greatly improved over the previous ones and now is the car it was billed to be in 2003 and 2004.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a Saab 9-5. Test drove Audi A4 and Acura TL as well as Saab 9-5 but kept coming back to the G-35. Technology / electronics are amazing - back up camera, navigation system, etc. Car rides well and is FUN to drive with outstanding handling and power. Great styling. Mileage better than expected - getting 21 to 22 mpg on highway with cruise control.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my brand new G35 a few months ago and I love my new car. This car is so fast and stable that you will go 100 mph without knowing it. I ordered it in black on black straight from Japan, so I had to wait a month, but it was all worth it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great engine in term of perforamce and acceleration. Love the leather seats, the compact flash drive for music, the build quality, love the bluetooth, love the room in the back seat, the voice command function and the exhaust sound.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned my G 35X AWD for exactly 1 week now and I'm sorry BMW, but this is the "Ultimate Driving Machine." My wife and I took it on a trip to Atlantic City, NJ and this car not only handles great, but has great pick up as well. We got about 21 mpg highway. I traded in my 2005 Lexus ES 330 for this. I looked at the 2007 Lexus ES 350 as well as the IS and the BMW 330xi and the Acura TL. This car blows them all away! While the Lexus has a slightly smoother ride, the G's ride is sporty, but not rough. The G also has more power that any of the others. I got the premium, navigation, and technology packages. The navigation is the best I've seen and the Bose stereo is outstanding. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned many European cars and if this does not scare them, I don't know what will. Car rockets from a stop jerking you into the seat for what seems to be a roller coaster ride. Rear seats are not really for a 6+ and if driver is 6+ only a small child can sit behind. Handles like a dream.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this '07 G35S 6mt for just over a week and it's a just as much a thrill looking at it parked as it is to drive. I have all the available options (tech, premium, navigation packages, 4WAS, factory spoiler, splash guards, cargo net). Shifting out of 1st is getting easier and the low-end gear power is awesome - I wouldn't consider the 5 speed automatic for this beast even with the paddle shifters. My wife drives an automatic but enjoys this manual. It's very quiet on the interstate and the suspension is tight but not harsh - just what you need for a true sedan sports car. The quality is great from fit to finish - just hard to keep it under 4000 RPMs during break-in. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the adaptive headlights at night, back-up camera is great, 4WAS suspension on S is just right.</FAVORITE>
