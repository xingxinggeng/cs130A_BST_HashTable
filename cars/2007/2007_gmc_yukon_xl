<TEXT>This Yukon replaced an 04 Tahoe w/ electrical issue. Love the comfort & interior space. Unfortunately we had it in the shop 7 times for 8 warranty issues in the 1st 6 mo. Now it's going through 6 quarts of oil in just 1,500 miles & I've had numerous other issues that were all warranty related. It's in the shop for no less than a week due to the oil issue which GM is aware of but as advised the dealer not to attempt repair. Luckily I have a good dealer they are trying to resolve the issue but have to tear apart the engine to do so. This all in 19 mo's of use. For the price it's not worth the frustration & days without it! Too bad b/c other than the warranty & oil issues I'd love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort, rides smooth, Seating for 8, sound system, the rumble, easy to use displays and information center. Customer service with the deal! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Replaced a 2001 YukonXL with a 2007 Denali. The quality of both has been great. The 2007 has side-airbags, stabilitrack and higher crash safety. This is not a good tow vehicle, on paper it looks great but the rear suspension is too squirmy - I think it is the air bags that level the load. The steering is ambiguous. A 3/4 ton YukonXL would have been a better choice. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine and transmission - 6-speed and it will hold a gear.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have always driven Suburbans and I love them, but if this would have been the 1st one I ever owned I would never buy another one again. I have had nothing but trouble with it since I've owned it. At 13k my transmission went out and I had to be towed in and 19k the alternator went out. Transmission is acting up again and every once in a while it will say add oil to engine and they can not find a leak anywhere. Dealer had done my oil changes to make sure it is being done the correct way and it will still loose 2 quarts of oil. I am getting ready to trade it off and yes I am going to get another Yukon XL because I do love my GMC's but it will not be the 2007 model. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was waiting for this model to be available from the used car lot. I finally found the one I liked and was not disappointed. How surprised I was to achieve 17.5MPG driving 75MPH. I love every feature in this truck. Great improvements in the steering, suspension and transmission. the truck is much more stable and smooth on the road compared to 2001 model I had before. Great job GM!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this Yukon XL 4WD 2007 model back in June 2008 from the dealer in Amman / Jordan. It has a 16 inch standard rims with narrow 245/75 wheels. Unfortunately, this SUV is the worst feel car that I ever drove. You feel uncomfortable in the 1st row, extremely in the 2nd, and worst in the 3rd. It feels like riding an open pickup truck and not at all like an SUV. The suspension is poor, rigid, and when you ride over a bump, the whole SUV shakes like a one rigid piece. Overall, a very bad experience that I will never repeat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After being a happy owner of an '03 5.3 Yukon XL, we upgraded to the Denali in '07. What a great vehicle it has been! The main reasons for this selection were the upgraded features, the towing ability, and generous cargo/people space. The burble of the 6.2 reminded me of the string of late 90's TransAms I did time in. Things that made the GMC the best choice over the Navigator were interior ergonomics, the discrete (if not slightly understated) luxury, the engine/6-speed with manual shift selections, and the interior decor (looks great in tan/brown) two tone). Almost two years later, we have not been disappointed. We have had no quality or warranty issues what-so-ever.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The towing capability of the 6.2V-8 is amazing. Pulling a 7,000lb rig is done with such ease, I can't believe that the stated towing capacity isn't something well north of 10,000lb. Also, I am very fond of the exhaust note/tuning - a great rumble!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>First, I am a volleyball mom, buses the kids great with room to spare. It is also my ski vehicle and I haven't missed a great snow day yet with the 4WD, traction, and ABS. In the summer it tows my 5500 lb. boat over Colorado passes to my favorite lakes. It also towed my 30 ft. travel trailer up the entire California coast. Lastly, it tows my motorcycles to my favorite off road trails. I have only bottomed out once! Great tow with room for gear!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Automatic start button on keychain, seat heaters, auto rear door (can ice shut), handles great even when towing, ride heigth, rear heat and air conditioning, dual climate controls, great sounding stereo, stops on a dime for an SUV, auto dimming mirrors, back up sensors are a must, information center</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great family vehicle. Love its style and comfort. We got a good deal 10,000 off msrp. Only problem is a phantom rattle or vibration in front at low coasting speeds. Dealer can't seem to figure it out. Also we did not get leather so the seats are a terrible lint trap. They collect everything from lint to hair. Towing is great. The fake chrome interior door handles are bad, had to be replaced due to chipping. At that price you think it would be cheaper to do it right the first time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was our third Denali. First 2 we loved, but new body was a headache. Constant downshifting with trans and dealership wouldn't acknowledge problem. Friend who's a mechanic has same computer as dealer and tells me all types of codes appear with his computer. Says they don't want to have to do recall with auto sales down (opinion). Paid cash and was dissapointed from day one. Poor gas mileage. Other than that, very comfortable and nice equipment. Have friends with either Yukon or Suburbans or Tahoes and everyone seems to have some type of tranny problem and dealers are looking the other way. Please beware of GM SUV's now. We just have to sell ours.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like my Yukon, it is easy to manuever and I like to drive it. I previously owned a 1995 Yukon XL and still have it running in good condition at over 200,000 miles. It is more sturdy than the 2007 and I thought that I was getting the same value when I bought my 2007.

<TEXT>I recently purchased my Denali for my expanding family. It is definitely much better than the Escalade. The power 2nd row seats are great and the DVD system is even better. Kids are much quieter in the back. You can watch a DVD in the front screen while parked. Navigation is easy to read and the denali handles very well. Great steering and stopping power. Power liftgate is a great option. Gas mileage is improved with the 6 speed transmission. I sit at 1500 rpms at 60 mph. If you want a stylish and reliable suv, keep the Denali on your list! Only problem: can't read the instrument gauge! It is black and hard to see during daytime. Need it in white! Black interior is very nice</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle has set new standards for me. I am a Suburban driver so I am new to the GMC family. This truck is really nice to drive so comfortable when on a long trip or in town. The Bose radio system has unbelievable sound. My Denali has every option you can get and they all have been great. The only thing is with the price of gas today the mileage could be better. But if I would have wanted 30 mpg I would have gotten a Honda or a small car. I just got 18.2 mpg on trip with the air conditioning on. Don?t be afraid of gas mileage with this truck. The performance with the 380 hp engine has plenty of power for you.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the Bose radio system, rear camera, room, ride and the power of the 380 ponies under the hood. The heated steering wheel and seats are also a plus. The many settings of the adjustable seat are good for my bad back.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my 2007 Denali XL but I have had major issues with it. Guages will quit working while driving, tells me to services suspension system, airbags, and tire pressure. Radio will not work, air condition freezes, windows wont roll down. Service dept has failed to fix it or find the problem. It has been in the shop 3 times. Also had leak in the rear damaged carpet and roof liner. Love the truck. I have been driving Denalis since 2000. I get a new one every year. Huge improvement from 06. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the exterior styling of this vehicle and the actual driving experience. After 16 months, still love the low rumble of the engine, the power and the smooth ride. Also pleased with the space for both passengers and cargo. Most complaints are minor design flaws noted by other owners. Front console needs compartments, 2nd row needs under-seat storage, 3rd row should fold flatter, remove easier. Main complaint is the brake dust rusting on the sides of the vehicle behind the wheel wells!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really think the exterior styling makes it one of the sharpest vehicles out there, 2nd only to the Pearl White Escalade which is $10k more! I think the MPG is acceptable for the size of the vehicle and the power it has. I like the park assist feature, Bose stereo, XM radio & mp3 compatibility.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great truck. With newborn twins and two older kids along with 2 dogs this truck fit our needs very well. Was very happy with the truck until the 12000 mile service. There is already a TSB. If you get any knocking in the engine, engine warning lights, traction control or stabilitrack error messages- go to your dealer! Cylinder #3 was self-destructing and they will not let me drive it due to safety concerns. Will see how long a new engine takes and am concerned that the new one will have the same issues.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an all-round great vehicle except for a few minor things that are ruining the experience. It has the worst high beams since my wife's Aerostar van (a candle anyone?); electrical gremlins have surfaced - the headlights go out while driving and then mysteriously return later - dealer can't diagnose and OnStar can't find anything; while idling, the truck activated the windshield washers and emplied the tank; problems with the rear view camera that were fixed with upgraded contacts. Driven responsibly, the fuel economy is on par with my 2005 AWD Yukon XL (a bit worse in town and a bit better on the highway). Tons of room inside yet remarkably easy to park in the city.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine (accelerates faster than anything this size should!), the speaker system, heated steering wheel, review camera, nav system, cabin materials (leather seats are much nicer than the vinyl look leather from previous generation), the ride (even with 20" wheels)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the newly designed 2007 model Denali with all the options. With winter here in Idaho, the accumulation of 1/4 inch of ice on the rear bumper, blocks the lift gate from opening. With the automatic lift gate option it keeps trying to open until it completes its cycle with all of the grinding that makes you cringe.. There is no splash guard to keep the tires from throwing snow and ice on the running boards. The build up of only a few inches does not allow the doors to open, or it drags the bottom of the door. When the snow melts on the roof it runs down between the door pillars and drops out the bottom and freezes on the running board, keeping the door from opening, or rubbing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded in a 2006 BMW 530i for our 2007 Yukon XL Denali (we have infant twins). My only complaints are some of the "luxury" aspects of the vehicle. Some of the interior design is 2nd rate for the price (dash board, area between seats, display, etc.). It rides great at all speeds. My wife was extremely nervous because of the size, but now has no fears. If you have a big family, this is your car. Plenty of space, plenty of power, plenty of quality. For all that complain about gas mileage-what do you expect? The vehicle weighs 7,000 lbs. It is the safest for my family. It carries my family with gear--sorry mini-vans, but I can pass cars with no problem at any highway with a loaded car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Of course this Denalli is awesome in every way. I thought our 03 Yukon was the best thing since sliced bread, but the Denalli made it seem like a 2 for 1 deal at KIA. But have you ever removed your third row seats? If you don't have a chiropractor you better get one. Why are these not folding flat yet? It makes me cringe when we need the space! Where's the hood light? Also a vehicle in this price range really should have air conditioned seats. And last but not least, as expected the stellar gas mileage. Obviously OPEC subsidises these vehicles in order to keep profits up, I mean this truck will outrun most sports cars on the road today but you'll never pass a gas station.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased on 2/23/2007 to replace my 04 Yukon XL Denali. It has a lot of upgrades for only 2k than the 03. The steering is much improved along with handling. The updated NAV and dash layout is great! Entry into the rear seats is much easier with power fold up. The sunroof does not make the presure noise of the past. Six speed trans is very smooth and increased MPG by 5 already. I miss the old seats, and dual tip computer on the steering wheel. The cruise is better, but like the old stereo controls. The center console is larger, but glove is smaller. It seems like lots of vinyl instead of leather with lots of plastic. The dash is hard to read in daylight and missing 2nd visor.

<TEXT>The vehicle performs very well. Towing a travel trailer across the country I got 12 mpg which I thought was fine. Solo it gets close to 20. Over 6,000 miles it has used no oil and the computer says to change it at 15,000 miles. The fit and finish was a little disappointing. I need to take it to the dealer to have the strip on the passenger side replaced as it is falling off. The right rear wheel well also has a slight defect. Other than the finish problems the vehicle performs very well. The navigation system is very good and performs exceedingly well. It got us out of several problems with detours.

<TEXT>Purchased this car on 01/02/07 to replace our 2001 Suburban LT 4x4. Demo with 1000 miles on it. Immediately drove from SF Bay area to Lake Tahoe for a week's vacation. Remote start was unbelievable. Start the car from the house, 10 minutes later, the car is warmed up, heat on full, heated seats on, etc. Such a pleasure! Kids love the DVD with wireless headsets, mom can listen to her music, too! Handles the mountain altitude extremely well - the 6-speed automatic really shifts smoothly on the steep inclines.

I love the space (Expedition lacked terribly), love the look, love the package (I got it loaded out), love everything about it (except of course the MPG... but was expected!). If you are looking for a wonderful SUV that is large enough to take a family of 5 (3 boys and mom and dad) on vacation yet nimble enough to park in the Walmart parking lot, this is it!

<TEXT>You will not be disappointed with this vehicle if you bought it to tow or carry people or both. Don't skimp on the engine choice. This big boy is worth the extra cash! Just plain fun to drive if you like performance. Pulling a boat loaded with gear for over 700 miles was a pleasure. I had to look in the mirror to make sure the boat was still there. The daytime reading of the instrument cluster is a pain. GM could take a lesson from Lexus in this area. Otherwise I am perfectly happy with this purchase, except I have to look for excuses to take it somewhere!! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The remote fold-in mirror accessory is awesome! What a neat toy. The manual shift feature is a riot to use for some one who likes to "gear down". Keyless remote is another fun toy. This baby is full of fun toys.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased '07 Denali XL as a replacement for BMW X5. For us, this car offered best combination of luxury, performance, and price. Interior design and trim are outstanding, 6.2L V8 is responsive and quiet, and suspension is soft, without sacrificing handling performance. Turning radius of this car is actually amazing, given its size. Right after break-in period, we are getting about 17.5-18 mpg on highway (driving between 70 and 75 mph, with 3 adults and 3 kids and some luggage, mostly flat road, AC cooling off 100F outside to 71F inside). Day to day mix of highway and city gives us around 14mpg. Compared to X5, this is about 1 less on highway - 2 in city, but w/ cheaper gas</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Space, space, space. There are very few vehicles with this kind of space, this level of trim, and this level of performance. V8, 6-speed, Autoride, DVD/XM/NAV system is probably one of simplest to use I've seen so far. Power liftgate, and easy access 3rd row are a big hit w/ Mrs.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had mine for a week+. I've had two other Yukon XL Denalis with an '05 the last. This one promises to be the best. One major flaw and a safety issue is that you cannot see the instrument cluster in daylight. Night viewing is fine. Before buying check that out and ask the dealer to guarantee a fix. The old Denalis had a built-in mud guards & the '07 doesn't so you should consider adding that or the sides of your vehicle will be a mess. With these two items fixed I would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone wanting a BIG SUV to tow a trailer, boat or just to haul a bunch of "stuff" and/or people around in relative. I didn't expect great mileage and that expectation was fullfilled.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Adjustable chime & turn signal volume, back-up camera, remote start, split third row seat, auto wipers, locking glove compartment, sliding sun visor, remote open/close rear cargo door, folding of second row chairs, feature programming and overall interior & exterior look, fit and finish. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just upgraded from our '05 Yukon to the '07 Yukon XL (due to a new arrival in the family). I was skeptical that there would be little to no difference in the actual ride quality, but I am no longer skeptical. This vehicle is hands down more comfortable than the previous models. I won't purchase one with leather until GM can prove that it can install leather that doesn't wear so horribly. Ours is an SLE, but opted for the rear entertainment, remote start, and XM as well. I appreciate that you load the DVD to be played in the front of the vehicle instead of the rear. I must say that the ride rivals that of my parent's 2005 Lexus LX470. Test drive one, you will feel the difference</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Remote start, rear entertainment, easier to fold bench seats in the middle, clean & easy to use audio system, very comfortable seats, you can load the DVD to be played in the rear entertainment system from the front seat (it loads above the CD player), fuel economy isn't bad for a vehicle this size.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>GMC has hit a home run with 07 YukonXL Denali. Priced way less than Escalade ESV and much tamer looks, this SUV has it all. We've owned it just under a month and the family loves it. Great ride, lots of power..and yeah yeah..could use better mileage. Entertainment system a hit with the kiddos,and Dad loves how it handles. Get one, you'll love it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auto Open tailgate, remote start, DVD entertainment. 2nd row buckets are great. Lots of room to move around back there. Great attention to interior detail design.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Only days with my new YukonXL Denali and it's clear GM has hit a grand slam! Awesome ride, excellent comfort, power to spare at 380HP, DVD is great for the kids, 20 inch chrome wheels dress it up, build quality seems great, this vehicle (Black Onyx and Black Leather interior) is a head turner. Sure gas mileage could be better (currently 11 to 13 MPH around town...expect it to improve slightly). GM did their homework and got the voice of the customer in designing the new Denali. Impressive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride is great...interior design is friendly..DVD system is great...and 10 speaker Bose stereo rocks. The 20 inch chrome wheels dress it up. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our third Yukon second Denali and it's great. Its drivability, style,accesories and comfort are exceptional. My wife bought it for me for mothers day and we have driven it everyday since. It has plenty of power, handles bumpy roads with the smoothness of our Lexus. The interior with the XM radio makes you want to just sit in the car. We were discussing putting in a DVD and sit in the back and watch a movie but it did not come with popcorn. seriously very happy with this vehicle.</TEXT>
