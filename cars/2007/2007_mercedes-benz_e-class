<TEXT>Purchased a CPO E320 Bluetec with 24K miles. Impressed with build quality, drive ability, features. I'm 6'4, 220 lbs, and have plenty of leg, hip and headroom both as a driver and as a passenger (can sit comfortably behind driver's seat which was set to my specs). Took a 1K mile shakedown to NW PA and averaged about 35.5 mpg in mostly highway driving between 70 - 75 mph. Stone quiet, provides a great sense of confidence in ride and handling qualities. Only quibble is the COMMAND radio system, for its apparent sophistication, has no satellite radio standard. I do not miss nav - that's why I use AAA maps!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased a CPO Bluetec with 24K. Dealer experience was excellent. In two weeks have put on two thousand miles of primarily highway driving between 70 - 76 mph. Average MPG is slightly over 35. Systems are A-1; everything is intuitive. Extremely comfortable and supportive seats in MB Tex. Will check back in after first D service in 8 K miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a '07 CPO E350 Sport/ Premium 1, Blk/Blk with 21,000 miles for $31k Aug 09. The car is very solid and well-built - no chassis flex, creaks, or rattles, very stable (runs likes it's on railroad tracks - smooth, stable and tracks very straight even at high speeds). Great value for a car with an MSRP of $55k. Acceptable performance; but it's no rocket or track-day thrill ride. I also own a '06 BMW 330 w/ sport package - the E350 can't match the 330 in terms of performance but it is certainly a very comfortable, solid, spacious, safe and prestigious (if that sort of thing matters to you)car. Very happy with the purchase, a top-of-the-line Accord will run you about the same money!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car with only 13K miles off a lease return. The 382 HP makes this car a rocket sedan. It rides like a luxury car but peforms like a sports car. The most pleasant surprise has been the gas mileage. On my first major highway trip I got an astounding 32 MPG while averaging 75 MPH! It takes a lot of restraint to hold back the reins on this thoroughbred. On my commute I normally get 26 MPG. The only problem has been the low profile tires. I've ruined two tires and bent two rims on pot holes. This is without a doubt the most fun I've had driving a car in the past 35 years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a black '07 e350, and it's wonderful. It has the sport package and only 21,055 miles on it! It was a lease, but i gotta say, that I will from now on, most likely buy Mercedes. The only "problem" that we've experienced, was the transmission ECU got a glitch, because i was shifting with Touch Shift while in comfort mode for an extended period of time, and i freaked out the tranny, so it went into limp home mode. i put the car in park, turned it off, and started it up again, and it reset itself, and everything has been fine since then. It is a wonderful car, and anyone looking to buy, should get one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After over a year of researching, test driving and contemplating, finally chose a CPO MB to replace my older '98 MB E320. Compared Lexus ES350, GS350, A6, Acura TL, RL, Infiniti M35, G35 None of those vehicles came close to matching the REFINEMENT of even my old E320!

<TEXT>So far this car is so much fun. It seems to have tremendous accelerating power and it drives like a dream. It has the sport package and the Conti tires, but it still drives very quietly and feels like total luxury. I just came out of a truck so maybe I just don't notice what the other reviewers are talking about. I chose all black with black birdseye, with premium I, and this car is HOT! So far it's great but I don't have a grip on the mpg yet. So far it's reading 21 on the display and I've been doing mixed driving. Hopefully I will see 25+ on the hwy like others have said. I almost went with another brand, glad I chose the E-class Mercedes. Looking forward to seeing the all new 2010.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Coming from an '06 330i. This car is feels like it's built like a tank. It has such a heavy feeling my wife feels really secure with. I think it feels too heavy, and a bit too soft, but not like a Lexus at least. You can feel the road below you, just with a filter whereas the BMW lets you feel everything. The engine is quite good, lots of torque in low RPMs. Fuel economy is not as good as a BMW, but respectable. Dealer installed Continental ContiSport3 tires. Wish they used something else -- they are really loud. And the navigation really is terrible -- only can direct you to a number range on any given street. Welcome to the 21st century, Mercedes!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just picked up a CPO 2007 E320 Bluetec. This is my 3rd Mercedes-Benz diesel ('74 240D 4 speed - 440K miles on it when the engine died due to loss of oil, and an '84 300D turbodiesel - sold at 337K miles and it's still running strong, from what I hear. This one is by far the best of them - I cannot imagine a car needing anything more than this car offers - quiet, fast, excellent fuel economy, beautiful build quality - it's all there. Only concern I had was repair cost, so I extneded the CPO warranty by two more years, to get me through 2013 - it was certainly cheap insurance, considering the labor rates and parts costs if something does go wrong out of warranty.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mercedes-Benz build quality - this car is solid, tight and incredibly well- built. I love (and have missed) that Mercedes vault-like 'thunk' when closing the doors, hood and trunk. Fuel economy and performance is excellent - 28mpg around town - no road trips yet, but can't wait!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my Bluetec for a little over a year, tons of power and torque. You could not guess you are driving a diesel. It is fast, quiet, luxurious, and most of all economical, getting 26 mpg around town and 32-34 on the highway. The $1,000 premium for the diesel over the E350 is worth it,( just look at resales between the E320 vs E350) test drove both with little to no difference in performance or comfort. Love the classic understated good looks, the pre-safe technology, and all the other safety features. Once I drove this car I questioned why would I drive any other car in this class ( test drove E350,BMW 528I, Cadillac STS, Infiniti M35, Lexus GS350). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Diesel. The best power plant I have driven in years. Great areas are the sound system, luxurious interior with real wood trim, and not faux metal, front seat comfort, and distinguished front end. The pre-safe technology makes me wonder how I lived without it. Reliability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Arctic White with P1 package (18" wheels, Sirius, heated seats, etc,). I was originally looking at a brand new C300 4MATIC but was disappointed that the C350 did not have an all wheel drive option. My other car is an '02 WRX and I was not looking to buy a naturally aspirated and less inspiring performer, which I found to be the case after driving the C. I picked up this beauty, fully loaded with the remainder of the original warranty, plus 100,000 miles that comes with the CPO status. This vehicle is absolutely stunning.

<TEXT>I've owned a BMW, a Lexus, a Corvette, two Subaru's, and two prior Mercedes. The Bluetec gets the ribbon. It has a tight, solid, heavy and luxurious feel, but the torquey motor gives it plenty of punch. I feel safe in this car, even at high speed. It has air bags everywhere, and the TeleAid system (similar to OnStar). It has a tight turning radius and is no problem to park. Visibility all around is excellent. And it is not ostentatious to the point that vandals want to mess with it. The automatic tranny does have the annoying and well-known habit of "hunting" between 1st and 2nd briefly when starting out, but I've learned to ignore it! My friend's Audi had the same problem. No biggie to me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The fuel economy is great. Around Seattle (very hilly, lots of stop and go) I get 25MPG. On a recent trip to Phoenix the computer was reading 41.3 MPG on flat highways at about 60 MPH. At highway speeds a 700 mile tank of gas is no problem. Also, the car's service interval is 1 year!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Cars don't get much faster and more fuel efficient than this BlueTec diesel car. There are almost 400 foot pounds of torque and almost 40 miles per gallon. Why buy a Lexus or Toyota or BMW when you will be slower, and consuming more fuel. Plus, the other cars' value will drop like a rock in a few years. I am pleased, very pleased with the MB E320 BlueTec. This is epitome of engineering and pizzazz! </TEXT>

<FAVORITE>The fuel economy is great. Around Seattle (very hilly, lots of stop and go) I get 25MPG. On a recent trip to Phoenix the computer was reading 41.3 MPG on flat highways at about 60 MPH. At highway speeds a 700 mile tank of gas is no problem. Also, the car's service interval is 1 year!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Cars don't get much faster and more fuel efficient than this BlueTec diesel car. There are almost 400 foot pounds of torque and almost 40 miles per gallon. Why buy a Lexus or Toyota or BMW when you will be slower, and consuming more fuel. Plus, the other cars' value will drop like a rock in a few years. I am pleased, very pleased with the MB E320 BlueTec. This is epitome of engineering and pizzazz! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Break dust is too excessive. Windows need to be tinted somewhat. Side mirrors should automaticaly close when car is turned off considering the cost of the car. Back seat is too small. Although there are 3 headrests it really is not comfortable for 3 adults. Headrest adjustments on the passenger seat fails to perform</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the fifth MB I've owned, and this one's the best. It handles beautifully, and is a delight to drive. But, the GPS has me screaming! It takes me the long way, and through neighborhoods no one should drive this car through. I now print maps from my computer before I leave home, and don't rely on the one in my car. Too bad.

<TEXT>This is my first MB and I bought it for reliability, economy and style and it has not let me down. Economy is amazing. I get 26 mpg in town and 28- 30 mpg on my 55 mile commute (at 80- 90mph!). Passing is effortless and silent, it really has quite a good mid- range punch. The 580 mile range is also great, a lot less time is spent at the pump. A 13,000 mile service interval is also a time saver. You can hardly tell that it is a diesel at all. The motor only rattles at low rpm, low speed with the window down. I've had just one issue, a buzzing speaker which was fixed under warranty. One small gripe is turbo lag, but you learn to drive around it. Buy one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love cars and the Bluetec is fun to own. Diesel power is amazing, liked the pull/torque better than the 350 gasser. Smooth and quiet. Not a handling machine, but this is a lux cruiser, not a sports car. 7-speed trans is great with the diesel's short power band, but it's a little jerky when cold. Smaller brakes than the 350 with larger wheels, but same tested stopping distance. Styling is subdued and refined, so I'll like how it looks for the long haul. HK sound system is really good. Nav works well, updates quickly, but a pain to enter addresses.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned Mercedes E-class wagons since my first purchase back in 2000 when a bought an E320 wagon. That car was great, then I purchased a 2004 E320 wagon, better but not excellent, then came my E350 4MATIC. It has so many options to choose from that the tested price went from a 55k MSRP to a 66,000 dollar family mover. It has a much more powerful engine and handles much better too. Also it offers equal amounts of gas mileage although it weighs more and has a more powerful engine. It has 270 hp and is all this 2 ton car needs to reach 60 mph in 7 seconds. Has the same horsepower as my wife's Lexus ES350 yet weighs 550 lbs more and still has the same acceleration times. Very great car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Distronic is cool although seems pretty useless unless you pay zero attention to the road ahead of you. The COMAND navigation is great and not as complicated as most poeple have claimed.

<TEXT>Test drove many luxury vehicles before deciding on the E350. Great offerings from other manufacturers. Electronics not as reliable as Japanese models, but only BMW felt as solid and refined. By far the best E-class to date. Very smooth with very little noise intrusion. Good accelleration, solid handling & strong, consistent braking. Relatively conservative styling, but still an attention magnet. The no-cost Sport pkg gives the styling a bit more edge, but still classy. Navigation isn't 3D and you can't type in the name or # of a business you wish to travel to, but otherwise, no complaints. Harmon Kardon sound system is great for most listeners and is far beyond earlier Bose systems.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first Mercedes and I'm very impressed. Test drove a 2006 E320 CDI last year and the difference between the 2006 and the 2007 model is substantial. The 2007 is much more quiet both inside and out. The torque produced by this engine is amazing. Considered a Lexus GS but this Mercedes just presented a more luxurious profile to me. The dealer I purchased from also installed the 18" 10-twin-spoke rims which really made this car stand out. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had one of the best expiriences driving the new Mercedes Benz E63. For some reason I just did not find anything wrong with the car for me to say oh they should have done this like this or anything like that. If you like the E55 then you'll love the E63. Not only does the car have speed that you need but also the handling that we all seek for. Taking turns at like 40 mph the car sticks to the road like it's on railroad tracks. Anyways long story short, if you have the money, this is the car you should get. I am a hundred percent that you will not regret buying this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently submitted a review of my new 2007 Bluetech. In this review I stated the problems I was having with the 7 speed transmission. I am happy to tell you that Mercedes has installed new software to eliminate this jerky shifting problem. My local dealer and Mercedes in Germany was involved in this process. It has been a week now since the update and the transmission is now shifting as smooth as silk. In fact, the transmission is shifting much more positive throughout the entire speed range. I think Mecedes and my dealer has done a great job solving this shifting problem and eliminating it. The entire process took about one hour. I thought you like to hear the good news.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Now that the transmission problem is eliminated I can not think of anything I do not like about the Mercedes BLUETECH. Great handling, lots of power, very good mileage and comfortable ride. Additionally, the great service at my Mercedes dealer is making the ownership of this car even more enjoyable</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had trucks for most of my life so I knew I had to get an all wheel drive car. This car is tops. I expected a little more power take off from the line, but the ride is so smooth you forget about it quickly. The interior is beautiful, and the trunk is loaded with space. I would have liked a little more radio control on the steering wheel though. And the turning signal switch is a little close to the cruise control switch and I hit it by accident sometimes, but I'll get used to that. Otherwise its the best car I ever had. I just bought the chrome kit for the headlights, exaust pipes, and tailights to top it off. All in all its a beautiful car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car replaced my 2000 E430. Much more power, with a much sportier feel. Got the sport package which is a free option this year. Tremendous exterior finish. The old car drove like a golf cart with immediate response and acceleration. The new one provides extraordinary power without realizing it due to the lack of jerks forward or acceleration kicks. Interior controls take a bit of instruction, but all are aimed to make sure the driver is comfortable. I have one in black and white exactly as pictured.

<TEXT>I traded a 2005 E320CDI for this 2007 BLUETEC. While my 2005 was a very good car, the handling of this BLUTEC is much improved, particularly the steering. The outside mirrors also are improved. I also have a transmision problem, it shifts jerky on take off, in first and second gear. Had it at the dealer several times for this problem. The dealer did confirm to me that Mercedes is aware of this rough shifting and is working on a solution. I was told it has something to do with the tourque curve of the diesel engine. I was given a Mercedes code number and was told the fix would happen after January first. I am sure Mercedes will get a handle on it very soon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned some very nice vehicles (Porsche, BMW, etc) but this is without a doubt the finest sedan I have ever owned or even ridden in. Smooth, quiet, comfortable with excellent handling and almost shocking acceleration. Unlike most cars (especially hybrids), the EPA rating is accurate. Took it on a long trip recently and got 38MPG with the cruise set at 75. I see no reason at all to even consider an E350. Ultra low sulphur diesel is still a bit hard to find but getting better every week. What's in the tanks at most gas stations is usually ULSD but most stations haven't been certified yet. Luckily, I only have to look for fuel about once or twice a month.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car for my wife, but maybe somewhat for myself as well. Luxury package, sport package, upgraded 18 inch spoked rims with the low profile Conti tires.

The Lexus simply lacks pizazz and road feel. The other day my better half rubbed a curb and cut the tire.

<TEXT>It was tough to let go of my '99 E430, but the 2007 E550 Sport made me forget in less than 6 seconds, zero to 60. The car is a perfect blend of luxury and power. I was close to buying the BMW 550 but the new E class facelift, Sport Package,(if you consider close to $70K free) 384 horses and add-on 18" AMG 5 spoke wheels with staggered Michelin Pilot Sport tires changed my mind. Time will tell in terms of reliability but I had good luck with the 99 E430 and I expect the same here. I am pleased so far with the 25MPG on the highway. The trunk is deep, not wide. Not easy to sling one golf bag, let alone two, in the trunk. I'll deal with it. The electronic trunk closer makes it worthwhile.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Adjustable suspension (sport v. comfort), heated and ventillated (not AC) seats, wood/leather steering wheel and the 18" AMG wheels. The car is definitely a looker and if you don't like who's looking, you can leave them in your dust. The NAV is intuitive, but the system in the trunk takes up width.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It was tough to let go of my '99 E430, but the 2007 E550 Sport made me forget in less than 6 seconds, zero to 60. The car is a perfect blend of luxury and power. I was close to buying the BMW 550 but the new E class facelift, Sport Package,(if you consider close to $70K free) 384 horses and add-on 18" AMG 5 spoke wheels with staggered Michelin Pilot Sport tires changed my mind. Time will tell in terms of reliability but I had good luck with the 99 E430 and I expect the same here. I am pleased so far with the 25MPG on the highway. The trunk is deep, not wide. Not easy to sling one golf bag, let alone two, in the trunk. I'll deal with it. The electronic trunk closer makes it worthwhile.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Adjustable suspension (sport v. comfort), heated and ventillated (not AC) seats, wood/leather steering wheel and the 18" AMG wheels. The car is definitely a looker and if you don't like who's looking, you can leave them in your dust. The NAV is intuitive, but the system in the trunk takes up width.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just leased a new '07 E350 with permium and sport pacakge. This is my first Benz and I love it. The sport pacakge is smooth and tight at the same time. Has a very nice feel to it. The 7 speed auto is very smooth, but downshifts late and sometimes does a little gear hunting.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The look and feel of the car inside and out. CD changer </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I can't say enough about this car. The fit and finish are 2nd to none. I love the Burl Walnut wood. The manager explained the high strength low alloy steel that Mercedes is famous for. This gives the car a secure heavy feel for the road and is rated extremely high in crash tests. I drove the V-6 and was impressed with th 268 horsepower but fell in love with the V-8...wow! Air conditioned/heated seats are a nice addition to the soft leather. This car was leased and I must say there is a good chance I'll buy this car when the lease is over.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power of the engine, the quiet cabin, and the feeling of "What's not to Love".</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I leased my E350 because of a deal that I could not pass up. My previous car was a 2000 BMW 528 w/ sport package. My E350 includes the Nav system, Sirius radio, and rear shade screen, but no sport suspension. Overall, I like the car. I never thought I would own a Mercedes. The car rides very nice on the road, but you get a floating feeling if you try to push the handling through turns. Power is more than ample and it gets relatively good gas mileage. I have got a supension squeak that occurs every time I get in the car when the car is cold. The dealer cannot seem to find, but I will give them another try. When this lease is up I will go back to a 530 BMW for better handling.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Satellite radio, cruise control, Navigation system and overall dash board layout.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A rocket with decent fuel ecomony. Comfort with a killer sound system. A joy to drive. I love that black birdseye wood trim and steering wheel. The sports package is a must</TEXT>
