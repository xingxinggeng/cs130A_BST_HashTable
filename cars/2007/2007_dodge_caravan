<TEXT>I bought this van new for my family needs. I have 27,000 miles on it now and have had no problems so far. The only complaint I have is the transmission downshifting from 2nd gear to 1st gear. It has a very hard downshift that is very noticable. If feels like I'm doing damage by driving it with this condition. I started noticing it around 800 miles and thought maybe it was just breaking itself in. I took it to the dealer and they said that they could find nothing wrong with it. I personally think that they don't want to acknowledge the problem. Other than the transmission, I really like the van.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Now have just under 80,000 miles. Van has been excellent. Still have original tires and brakes. Only part replaced was a rear bearing hub. Highway mileage on straight run is 26 mpg, consistent 20 mpg in town. Van has been my first van ever and would easily buy another due to versatility. Have not had the transmission issues mentioned in other posts. I have zero complaints.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Dodge Caravan, and my family and I love it. I had my first one for almost 12 years and almost 200K miles with minimal problems. This one has most of the bells and whistles and I got it for $22K; a steal. I have the 3.8L engine and it really is more than I needed, but because of the package, I had no choice over the engine size. The 3.3 is more than enough unless you are pulling a load. Reading some of the other posts I guess that I was lucky since I have had no problems whatsoever with this van. It has a smooth and quiet ride, pretty quiet interior, and extremely comfortable. The stow and go seats just made it better. Overall, a great family van suited for long trips. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The stow and go seats, powerful engine, smooth and stable ride, automatic doors, and the video and six-disk changer. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this van! I have a 1997 version of this faithful van and found this one to be much better. Mine is the quitest car I have ever owned! It is as quite as my Mercedes so I know what I'm talking about. Great car for road trips.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The storage areas. Seems everywhere I look there is a place to put stuff. The great thing about it is that no one can see my gear when looking at my van. Great facture far not being broken into.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the noisiest car I have ever driven. Sounds like the transmission is already in trouble after only 4000 miles and earlier. The road noise is awful . Could be the tires. Will take it back to the dealer next week, but compared to my 2000 Voyager its just noisier and parts internally and externally seem flimsier. Hope they are not going back to their old poor workmanship compared to Japanese cars.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very good price compared to the toyata I almost purchased. But for a difference of about 5k. I stuck with the Dodge. Design is quite good, but not that much of an improvement over my 2000 Voyager, although I love the way the seats fold down. Took a long time to get that. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am happy with my 2007 Dodge Caravan SXT 4dr Minivan (3.3 L 6cyl 4A). Also I got lifetime powertrain warranty that no one offers out in market. Also my friend had it for 3-4 years & has low maintenance cost. Compare to toyota & honada you pay more & get same by the way when you buy dodge help US economy not foreign county</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just the facts: Vehicle bought new; enjoy driving but transmission has been problem from start. Hard shifts up and down but not 100% of time. Happened so much now that I'm picking up squeaks from the fact that the front end is jarring so much. I had rented another new vehicle in '07 from a car rental co. Enjoyed it much which cause me to desire one. I put over 5000 miles on the rental. I bought the current one new; put over 4000 miles on a trip. It started having troubles with the transmission that was noticeable at probably 500 miles. Enjoy driving it but HATE this problem. First new Chrysler product purchased ever and last!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stow and Go package; still offered cassette tape with CD on this</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our first minivan. I love the roomy interior, the styling and the seating is comfortable. However, it is the noisiest car I have ever owned. Something, which I believe is the passenger sliding door, is rattling. But the dealer does not hear it. When you drive on a bumpy road it feels as if the car is going to fall apart. We have had it in to have the brake drums replaced due to noise and now it is making the same noise from the front. I still really like the van, but I hope the dealership can find the source of the noises and rattles and fix the brakes once and for all. It only has 6500 miles on it, we bought it brand new.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the 5th Chrysler/Dodge minivan that I have owned, and the worst of the bunch. Good design intention, failed execution. Radio does not get local stations, transmission had to be re-programmed, (that would fix tranny problems also in these reviews) driver's door re-aligned twice, overhead console loose, failed cup holder, weatherstripping falling out of driver & passenger window and hitting people in head, failed resistor in blower control. Must say dealer is absolutely great, but manufacturer built a lemon for me and will not own up to it. E-mailed Dodge web-site, called them, and still no satisfaction. It seems like they want to drive their customer to other makes. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Basic design, prefer smaller wheel base for parking in city. Built-in Bluetooth </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Driving and comfort not an issue, the caravan performs. It's the transmission thats driving me crazy. When slowing down the tranny is trying to downshift 2nd to 1st is a real pain. The clunking or grabbing is a real nuisance. What's worse is Wellington motors is denying that Chrysler had issues with this tranny and still is selling these vans. Chrysler Canada aside from trying to give me $50 gift certs.keeps telling me their engineers are looking into it. I have been told that the fix would be there early Aug.2007 that was moved out to the end of Sept to the new year and now I havent heard from anyone.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Outside of the tranny issue i find the van performs great. rear seats removal is a big improvement from the last van I had which was a 1999. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT> I bought a 2007 Dodge Caravan on 07- 02-07. Transmisson was bad the day that I drove it off the lot. Have had it worked on twice by the dealership. Still have the same problem as day one. Chrysler can not fix the problem and like anything else you buy, if it don't work, it should be replaced. I get get mad each time I pull from my drive. Never fails that I get a hard shift. I did not buy the van to have this problem. I would like to know if Chrysler has plans to make repairs in the near future. Vehicle has learned my driving habits by now. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE> Can't say, as I've been upset ever sense drving it off the lot.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We replaced a 1994 Voyager with this 2007 Caravan. The spirit is the same, with a tidy wheelbase and four bucket seats, but the new Caravan is smoother and quite a bit bigger inside. It is getting the same mileage--about 17 mpg in short trips around town and about 24 mpg on the highway--but is noticably better in acceleration despite having the same basic engine as the '94. My wife wanted the short wheelbase minivan for its maneuverability around town and is very happy with it. I find it a pleasant car when I drive it, particularly cruising down the highway. A piece of weatherstripping needed to be replaced on the front door, otherwise it has been perfect so far. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Space, maneuverabilty, four comfortable bucket seats. Low price for what it offers. Sirius radio is a nice bonus.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned over a dozen vans in my life, from every American manufacturer. This van has proven to be the most economical one. Reasonably priced to start, the gas millage is decent at 23 MPG combined city hwy, and Insurance cost are low. With 15k have had no issues except a less than smooth transmission downshift which the dealer says is normal. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tight turning radius on short wheel base. Very quiet ride</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Minivans are the way to go for all my gear and traveling with or without family. The stow away feature is a must, but lowers the van too much for bad dirt roads. What you get for the money is far beyond what a car or SUV can deliver. If they would only come up with better gas mileage. I think that a continuously variable transmission would help a lot. Also a computer assisted economy mode, and maybe a smaller engine. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The stow away is fab. The new reverseable seating with table is also. You can make a great deal. Do try for side rear air bags, if they are not standard yet. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My Grand Caravan is comfortable, has excellent crash ratings,with plenty of room inside, and has reasonable performance and economy(acceleration is only adequate). I liked the safety of side air bags, the rear backup alarm, pretension seat belts. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The versatality of the quick change Stow and Go seats makes this both a cargo or passenger van. I liked the remote door openers for shoppers with hands full.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We wanted the 2008 GC or TC, but excise tax in Puerto Rico is huge, over 30% on top of full MSRP, so when new 2007 SXT model became available at liquidation sale at under $20K, we jumped at it. Nice surprise was that SXT came with additional options cruise control, power driver's seat, power slide door and 6 CD player we didn't expect, so we paid $5K less than invoice and avoided taxes altogether, and dealer drove new car over 100 miles to us where we had a mechanic verify it was new. Hot PR weather requires AC on full time, so gas mileage is only three quarters expected. I'm only 6 ft. tall but still find pedals short and side door controls scrape my legs in front seats. Otherwise, OK</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cruise control lets me rest feet from pedals</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really enjoy the Grand Caravan SXT, special edition. It seems to be roomy has a lot to offer and was a lot less money than the Honda, wish we could have waited for the 2008, but very pleased with this van.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stow and Go, DVD player in the dash with our family is great (not on the unit like GM) Sirius radio for 1 year is neat too</FAVORITE>
