<TEXT>I first test drove my kia initially as a joke. I needed a fwd car to commute for school even when the roads where covered in snow, so it was time to say good-bye to my rwd firebird. I also needed something low-mileage considering I now drive 600 miles a week. I was surprised while test driving the spectra. It was more powerful than i expected, quiet, subtle yet well controlled body and suspension movements, packed with tons of standard features, great stereo, ergonomically correct controls, mid- sized interior room and driving dynamics, and the overall sophistication of the entire package. All for $7300 that included the remainder of the factory warranty. More than "basic" at a "basic" price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Visibility, crome accents, ease of controls, interior room, no squeaks or rattles, driving refinement compared to most domestic cars, mp3 stereo, 30city 38hwy mpg, lively 2.0L, smooth shifts, quiet, 6 standard airbags, great brake feel, gauge cluster, air filtration, power heated mirrors, TPMS.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've always owned Hondas so when it comes to the Kia, it had to go a ways to measure up. It has. It has 27,500 miles on it, purchased it with 24,000 but it looked and drove like new. I'm pleased with it. Now, if it lasts as long as my Hondas did (200,000 or more miles with regular maintenance), I'll be happy. Resale isn't worth anything but I always buy to keep for many years, hopefully. I really like this car. It's as good as my last Civic. And used, it was about half the cost with this low mileage.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's responsive. The trim and interior measures up. And it's not a bad car for the highway. Quieter than I expected after reading former reviews...</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just want to help others looking for a car and are interested in a Kia Spectra EX. First off, Highway miles is excellent, but the all around town use could be better. I love this car. The outside style is nice. The inside is great. Everything is power. The only this car didnt come with, was a sunroof. On the highway this car can move. and around town as well. I'm 6'0, and I have no problem. It is roomy for me and my three kids (two 6 year-olds and a 20 yo). When I originally went to buy this car, I compared it to the Corolla, the Civic and the Sentra. Out of all the cars, this offered the most for the buck and how can you argue with the 100,000 mile warranty. Dealer maintained.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the inside comfort and the ride. It is a little loud at times, and when the AC is on, you can feel the car "push." All power. This is the PERFECT car for an all around car for the price. Hopefully the Kia name will gain popularity like Honda, Toyota and Nissan.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased a 2007 Spectra with around 40k miles on it. Only problems so far are a blown speaker when I bought it (didn't realize it initially.) So far though the ride in the car has been great. I was coming from a 2000 Kia Sephia, and this is leaps and bounds better. Kia certainly has come a long way from when they started. My bf has an '06 Corolla, and the '07 Spectra is actually comparable which says a lot considering the prices between the 2 had a $3000 price difference on the used market at the least. The MP3 jack is a great addition and the interior is quite classy. Much better choice then a very old model Honda or Toyota.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MP3 jack. Nice interior with attractive fit and finish. Smooth ride. Quiet ride. Good acceleration. Nice keyless entry features on a super-low priced car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got this car after my 2005 Honda Civic EX was (unfortunately) totaled. I bought it used with 35k miles and it now has 38k. Let me stress that I absolutely LOVED my Civic, so I wasn't exactly thrilled about getting a new car. But after 3000 miles, I've learned to love my Spectra almost as much as the Civic! It only has about 30 more horsepower than my Civic did, but it's very noticeable. The engine is extremely quiet upon acceleration, and I have to watch out or else I'll end up doing 80/90mph without even noticing. Fuel economy is great. I've gotten up to 430 miles on 12 gallons (close to 500 on a full 15 gal). The seats are very comfy (I drive long distances often). Great little car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My daughter's first car - she wanted the Spectra5 from the start but I made her check out ALL other makes and models first. Long process but worth it since the Spectra5's value is far superior: vibrant styling inside and out, standard equipment that is optional on others, superb warranty, excellent safety features and of course, great gas mileage. Go ahead and check out the others but you'll end up in the Spectra5 when you're done! </TEXT>

<TEXT>After hearing about safety issues with older Kias (side impact problems), I was a little wary of getting into one, but that has apparently been resolved with the new models. I have had my '07 for almost 2 years now, and it is one of the best, most dependable vehicles that I have ever driven. Smooth driver, but you have to watch your speed (my gf hit 93 MPH without realizing the first time she was on the HWay), I've personally gotten it up to 112 without struggling (I know, bad!). Fantastic fuel economy, good factory sound system with AUX input, intuitive cruse control paddle shifter, GREAT pickup and 0-60 acceleration. Solid feel to doors/trunk/hood.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>FUEL ECONOMY! I cannot stress this enough, I spend about $30 a week on gas, and still put on about 30k mi a year. Constantly surprises people when I let them drive it, they are expecting a weak econobox, and get surprised by the pickup</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After driving LHS, Accords, Regal, Impala for years, I love this high quality minimalist car. The doors clunk nicely, all needed equipment is here (pw, heated p mirrors & r. defrost, remote lock, cruise, auto) and it drives like a dream. I love taking this car out for a cruise, because of its maneuverability, agility, solid brakes, easy steering, and overall high capability. Never would have considered a KIA, except we saw an ad for $12,000 cars and paid a little more for this. New. I always buy ABS. But these 4-W-discs are well dialed in, great feel, strong. So mine is non-ABS. This car reminds me of my 91 Camry and 93 & 94 Proteges: fine-handling, very capable small car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Straightforward, simple dash and controls. Good torque and power, great cruiser at all speeds up to 100. Heat, air, defrost all function well. Excellent handling and brakes. This car is a joy to drive, it's instinctive and about drives itself. Great warranty. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought new in 07, wanted to trade it in for a camry, well, disapointed to say the least, i still owe $12,xxx.xx and resale value is only $7,xxx.xx so I am kind of stuck with it. Has been a good car other than my key getting stuck in the ignition. Got fixed real fast. Also, th dealer will not cover you with a loaner unless you are getting the 30 and 60,000 mile check up. I wish I knew this before I bought.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car as a commuter car. Drive 25 miles daily to work. It is so comfortable and fun that we now use it almost exclusively. Took it on vacation this year and drove 2600 miles in 2 weeks averaging 36 mpg at 67 mph. At 80 mph it averaged 31 mpg. Snappy does not like 91 octane gas but does best with 87 octane.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My tire pressure sensor system did not work for 5000 miles after I bought this car. This car is an excellent car with power and excellent gas economy (rare combination indeed). The dealership really did suck though. There was a graduate incentive, and this was not followed up on by the dealer. Lost my 500.00.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I believe in best for the money. I had a 2002 Passat before this car and love everyday in my Spectra 5. The car handles great, almost as well as my Miata. The interior is excellent, the seats are supportive and the room is amazing. It feels better built than a Corolla, is faster than a Matrix and has almost as much interior room as my Passat. In crash tests it gets two excellent and two good scores, so Edmund's is wrong in that department. The engine has guts and gets great mileage. I loaded it to where I could not see out the rear window and drove it half way across the country and averaged 37 mpg. Take into account the cost, equipment and warranty and I had no problem deciding to get it</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Better car than the press lets on. Handles very well, responsive brakes, great ride. The room inside surprised my 6+ foot tall friends. Edmund's says the engine is noisy but it has a great 4 cylinder growl when accelerating and its not all that loud. If Toyota sold it the press would love it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I rented a 2007 Kia Spectra EX and a 2007 Ford Fusion for two weeks each before deciding to purchase a Kia. The Kia interior is ultra modern, while the Fusion is dated and cumbersome. As a musician, I was impressed by the Fusion's great sound system -- that's about all. I upgraded the sound system of my Kia and now my car is almost perfect. The car handles beautifully and the transmission is excellent. My Kia is fun to drive and I look forward to each trip, whether short or long.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This has been a good car so far. I am not thrilled with the gas mileage, I get about 32. Somtimes that dips to 29 mpg. I had a 94 Escort wagon 5 speed that got 36 no matter how you drove it. It would keep up with the KIA too! Otherwise I have really enjoyed the car, runs great and is comfortable even with all the seats full. Stereo is really nice. Insturments and extra features are really nice. Really has the other companies beat on added features I think. No problems mechanically and I am at 20,000 miles today. Some times if it is really low on gas it does not start on the first try. If you turn the key off and try again, it starts everytime, wierd but not a problem.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6 CD stereo is super, cargo compartment very nice, alloy wheels are great, mirror and rear defoger with wiper is very nice. Roomy cabin is very comfortable, 5 speed tranny is responsive and smooth.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did a lot of comparing to other cars when I went into the world of 'compact' cars (I was seriously looking at cars like Corolla, Mazda 3, Focus, Civic, etc.). For the price of this car and what you get, I find that the Kia Spectra was the best choice for me. I was looking for an all around fuel effecient, comfortable, reliable 'get around town' type of a car. The cabin is very comfortable, the style is nice and the car performs great! It has all the power options, a CD player, and even great tires! I'm very happy with the Spectra. I'm 6' tall and the driving is comfortable and the console is very user friendly. If you're looking, test drive a Spectra!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the inside. All power options (except the sunroof). The console is nice and very user friendly and has the CD player. I love it! Very comfortable roomy front.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Brand new sedan that looks beautiful in sand beige metallic, and light interior. Has all necessary amenities and many standard luxuries. Handles great with impressive speed on the open road, especially for a 4 cyl. Acceleration acceptable, but allow for somewhat sluggish start on freeway entry ramps, for example. Body is naturally low to ground, but very little road noise in a comfortable, easily controlled drive. For all-round usability, at a reasonable new car price, the Spectra sedan is a good buy with an outstanding warranty. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This was my first Kia, I had known a lot about Kia before, and was waiting for the lease on the current vehicle at the time to run out. When it did, I went straight to the dealership. It was February, and it was COLD (Michigan) so I took the red EX on the showroom floor with a spoiler. It was an '06 model. It was a great car, loved the gas mileage, and very comfy. Handled the snowy icy roads surprisingly well, got many good looks. Couldn't believe the power for a 4 cyl! Took it to Florida a year later (3,000 mile round trip) and drove mostly 90 all the way there and back, the spedometer doesn't lie, it goes 140!! It was very solid, very little wind noise. Faster you go, the less wind noise.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I did a thorough search when looking for a new car (Mazda, Ford, Hyundai, Toyota) and decided on a Kia Spectra. This car came standard with everything I needed. Some options like air and six airbags came at extra price on the other cars I looked at. I was amazed at how quiet the ride was and what a zippy little car it is. So far in mixed driving I have been averaging 32 mpg. The sound system is fine and the car hugs the road even in a heavy downpour. This car came with 4 wheel disc brakes that work so well I think anti-lock brakes would be overkill!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Six airbags and alarm system, great fuel mileage, wonderful handling, nice styling, good placement for controls. A warranty that is matched only by Hyundai.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Although this may be considered a "practical" car, it's still fun to drive. The vehicle is as composed at 90 mph as it is at 55 mph. The radio and climate controls are large and easily laid out. Noise isolation and a weak engine are the cars only real vices. Engine and road noise will have you speaking louder or turning up the radio a few notches. Off the line acceleration is feeble at best.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Happy Spectra Owner</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have been driving Jaguars and Cadillacs for a long time. I decided I needed a small economy car. I did a lot of research and decided on the KIA Spectra... and I love it! I am not at all disappointed in this car. This Spectra is quiet, solid, comfortable, zippy, it handles beautifully and is fun to drive. It is also a bargain to buy new. You really can't put it in the same class with Corolla and Civic and others because you can drive it away for so much less money. This is a fact that is often missed in the reviews. I am convinced that I got a great car, an economical car (I am getting 28-26 mpg) and that I definitely received value for money. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a Pathfinder, yes, and I am glad I did, no regrets. Great gas mileage, car has pep, it's fun to drive. I've had no issues at all with car. I've been in for first service and they were awesome. I got the sports package and it beats all comparable cars hands down in styling and utility. I get compliments wherever I go and the cars actually turns heads. I think the sports package is worth the extra money for the features and styling you get. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gosh what's not to like. There are so many cool features on the model I bought. The only thing I don't have that I did in prior vehicle (Pathfinder) is power seats and leather seats. I don't miss the power adjustment and leather. That stuff is always cold or hot!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Kia Spectra5! The Kia is sporty to drive and responsive in its handling. No complaints. The 5 speed manual is smooth, and the engine is surprisingly powerful. I like that the look is understated and not so in your face. It grows on you after while and I look forward getting in the car and drive to my next destination. Fit and finish and attention to detail is first rate. Very roomy for a car this size. Lots of storage and handy appointments, even "secret" compartments. Last but not least is value for money. This car costs considerably less than similarly appointed cars, like the Mazda3, Honda Civic, Nissan Sentra, VW Golf. Highly recommended! 5 Stars *****. :)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Impossible to leave the headlights on, accidentally. When you open the driver side door all head lights and interior lights shut off automatically. Other manufacturers may have this too, but this is the first time I took note of that feature. Great front speakers! (See also improvements). Storage!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Pros: Sporty, roomy, great mileage, comfortable ride, every option you would need, the fit and finish is great. Cons: A smidge noisy at higher speeds but to be expected in a smaller less expensive car. I am 6'3" and over 350 lbs and I have ample room on this car. I also have 2 young boys and they have stated that they have more room in the back seat then they did in my Nissan Frontier Crew Cab. I can fit my golf clubs and pullcart in the hatchback with out having to fold down the seats. This is a great car for someone looking for a gas sipper who is on a budget. It has the flexibility of a Mini-minivan, and the feel of a sportscar. I know Mazda has Zoom Zoom but my Spectra5 has zip zip.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Prior to purchasing this car, I had a 2006 model, which was a spectacular car. I never would have guessed that the 2007 model could top it, but it did! The exterior and interior have some great new accents - minor changes, but wow! Especially the interior - silver accents on the dash, armrest controls, and door handles give the black interior a touch of class. The speedometer has a new look, too, and it's easier to read at night. I haven't measured, but I think the 2007 has a bit more clearance. I've not bottomed-out on any potholes yet. Best of all, there's a bit more space both through the hatch and the rear passenger doors. I can fit my folding tables in the 2007, not the 2006. Awesome!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great styling, smooth drive, excellent gas mileage, comfortable. Driver's seat adjusts three ways! Quiet, power everything, lots of storage, 60/40 split rear seat, iPod input, head and leg room, turns on a dime! Air conditioner quiet and cool! Cruise control standard.

<TEXT>Plain and simple I love this little car. First time buyer of Korean car. Rides nice, love the mileage, no problems so far in the 6 months I've had it. The sunroof package is great. I noticed some small amount of road wander though, but it's still worth the money. I bought some Kia accessories to really make the car look sharp. I get lots second looks on the highway. I got the car in red, love it, plus it passes a lot of gas stations. I am averaging about 34 mpg. So far, so good, no real complaints. It's a quality built car that I think you should test drive. I got the 5 spd. I think Kia is on track to surpass Japanese quality or at least equal it for far less money. I would buy this car again in a heart beat.</TEXT>

I have found good reasonable performance from the engine, the suspension, the transmission, the fit and finish inside and out is good and the car is not "plain Jane". It is a stunning car just as it is. Then there is the price. I will report more after a few miles have been put on it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought it, broke it in and then drove from L.A. to Zion Nat'l Park to Lees Ferry to Grand Canyon and back with car fully loaded (included two bikes on a hatch rack). I even slept in it twice. It handled great and was always comfortable! I love it! Pros: spacious, good control placement, storage!, good handling turning when driving aggressively, looks. Cons: odd acceleration - tends to over-rev, rear speakers. Bottom Line: I've looked and this is the best car for the dollar for space, fuel economy, comfort, looks. Another may handle a bit better or jump faster but Kia's the best overall.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Alloy wheels and standard options, MP3 player/iPod jack, terrific interior design and smart hatch opening design that gives you maximum floor space with seats down all the way to the hatch; great storage pockets, nets, etc. Best warranty out there and lowest starting price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car was bought primarily as a commuter with the occasional 700 mile trip to see the grandkids. We've had it for about a month and the mileage has ranged from 29.7 to 35.1, well within my goal of 30 mpg average. Overall my expectations have been exceeded, not only in gas mileage but overall value and general soundness of the vehicle. No rattles or squeaks noted, and the doors close with a solid thunk. I am especially surprised by the sophisticated standard features on this car - tire pressure monitors, 6 airbags, heated mirrors, iPod input, 6 way adjustable seat. We are extremely satisfied with Phil, our Spectra.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great compact sedan and gives you more than expected for the money! The fuel ecomony is awesome. I am currently getting 34 mpg. For a 4 cylinder, it really zips around.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Super experience with the KIA dealership. Test drove in pouring rain, handled great w/o abs. Got the EX w/ auto trans. Simple controls, easy drive, decent safety features, and impressive looks for 17,000 car. You won't win the Indy 500, but you'll look great driving in everyday traffic and save $ on gas and laugh at people in their big, expensive gas guzzling SUVs and trucks. Warranty super, so no need for ext. warranty. Auto trans, cruise, and rear spoiler, and I drove away paying less than 17000. KIA has arrived. Give it a try.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy to get in/out. Comfortable ride. Good acceleration, fairly quiet for small car, great handling. Exterior looks amazing for price of car. Gas mileage will ease your pain at the pump.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The car performs very well and is amazingly quiet and well mannered. A long drive does not beat you up. Mileage at mostly 65 mph with periodic in town stop/go was 43 mpg - really! Conversations are in normal tone of voice at 60+ miles per hour. Many conveniences on the EX model I thought would cost more and do on competition models. We are happy with the car and look forward to saving gas $$. Also rated very "green" top 30. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power everything. Great air conditioner. Very quiet for a compact. So far gas mileage. Good acceleration in the city. Functional dash design - easy to reach and use. Standard tire pressure sensor for each tire!! Really!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>There was nothing out there from the big 3 (or 2?) that combined the fit & finish, ergonomics, and gas mileage of the Kia Spectra5. I am replacing a Grand Marquis for my 110 mile round trip commute. At 6'1" 230 lbs, not many small cars fit me well. Kia seat is comfortable and everything (switches, etc) is where it should be. First tank of gas got 32 mpg in decent traffic, second tank in stop and go and stop traffic averaged only 29 mpg (my prior car got 19.6 and 12 mpg respectively in these situations, ao this is much better). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Aux radio input, gas milage, head room, leg room, control layout, hatchback, quietness (relative to other small cars).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car! It is the perfect size for me. It drives great and the brakes are awesome too! It compact enough to fit into smaller parking spaces but roomy enough for my 6 foot 4 inch brother to sit comfortably!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Spectra for a little over a month and I love it. It is a very comfortable ride. I get around 400 miles to a tank with combined city/highway driving. All controls very easy to reach.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car! I checked out a lot of cars. I sold cars for over 10 years, so I know what to look for. I was amazed that "KIA" quality had surpassed Hyundai, and in some cases the Japanese imports as well! I drove the 5 speed and I know it has a lot more pep. But I was quite pleased with the overall performance of the automatic. So the auto won out. It's black and handles great. I took it to the coast first weekend so I could drive on the beach...what a blast! My only complaint is I wanted the power moonroof but you have to get the ABS option as well (package). And I did not want ABS, so no sunroof. All in all a great car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car is comfortable and I fit in well even though I weigh 250 lbs. Although a decent car, I probably would have been happier with a Toyota or Honda. Engine seems very noisy in the morning and quieter in the evening. All in all not a bad car but not a great one either.</TEXT>
