<TEXT>I have had this truck for two years with no issues. I have a 6" lift, 35" tires, magnaflo exhaust, airaid intake and throttle body spacer, and I pull a 7x14 enclosed trailer loaded with toys and I get about 14-15 mpg, that is going up many big hills, and going about 65. I didn't buy this truck for gas mileage I bought it to play with and tow with, great choice.....at least my dodge doesn't have spark plug issues.....(5.4L)any guesses?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 2005 Dodge SLT 4x4 in on a Cadillac for my Wife, and regretted doing so as I missed it so much, so I bought the 2007 when I had the opportunity. It is a 2007 SLT Sport 4x4 with the Hemi and it is a fantastic truck. It sits outside day and night in uncovered parking in the hot Arizona Sun, and it has never let me down, doesn't over-heat, and the truck still looks like Brand New. The Arizona Heat can cook an interior, but so far, nothing has warped, nor faded. Now mileage totally stinks, and it gets worse mileage with the 8/4 Engine than the V-8 Hemi did in my 2005, and gets roughly the same mileage as my 1973 Dodge Powerwagon did with a 360. It averages only 12 MPG, which stinks!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power - 345 Horsepower and lots of torque. The Ride - Okay it's a little bumpy, but it is a 4x4 and with the 20 inch rims, it rides a little rough. Visibility - Great visibility with no blind spots.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Before I bought this truck I read every one of these reviews. Now after owning it for a few months I'm surprised they were so positive. I thought I'd add my 2 cents. Put simply, if you buy a truck to use a truck. Avoid this one. I tow and use my truck alot off road. Build quality is extremely flimsy. Tranny has very irritating and weird shifting tendencies. Road wander is horrible in this thing. The slightest little bump will send it bouncing all over the road. If you just go to and from work, and Home Depot on the weekends and don't mind the bouncing into the next lane when you hit a bump. This truck is for you.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Never had any issues with the truck. Truck came with the 20 inch wheels which is what I liked. It also came with the Hemi motor, and its really response when the pedal is floored. The Hemi is sensitive on the brands of gas, so its best to use a popular brand.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For the most part I really love this truck!! Awesome looks and can't beat the power of the hemi! But it is headed to shop for the fourth time for leak in back window. When it rains, the storage buckets under the back seats will have water in them. Can't seem to get it stopped. Also, truck comes out of reverse occasionally. Doesn't happen on a daily basis, but just enough to worry me. Thank goodness I have the lifetime warranty on the powertrain so that it will be covered if it gets any worse. Really hope they can get the leak fixed because I love my truck and don't want to have to end up trading it due to one issue!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great truck so far. Very dependable with respectable power from the little 4.7, but horrible gas mileage. I don't drive it too hard and have never got much higher than 15 mpg, even on the highway. I think it drives pretty smooth for such a big truck. The best part to me is the look it has. Mine has the chrome 2o's and i think it looks better and tougher than any other. I would recommend this truck to anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have to say overall I love my truck. It's not perfect though. The gas mileage has never really improved that much, the driver door doesn't seal very well and at highway speed there is a lot of wind noise. I have a leak from the front (probably by the looks of it the front trans axle) which is going for service next week, the Hemi engine when driving at highway speeds and switches to 4 cylinders will cause wheel spin on ice/black ice. This is a major problem for those of us north of the border in the winter! I also pull a 29' camper trailer with my truck and I wish I upgraded to the 2500 when I purchased my truck 2 years ago. Overall I am happy, but I will consider a Ford next time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned GM vehicles always and we were looking for a good lease deal. Dodge was the greatest. We hesitated getting Dodge because what some people say but that truck had such an extreme hard life and never left us stranded. Never any transmission problems or anything. Up huge hills with 5 snowmobiles on the back of a trailer to the rug, burnout competitions, snowmobile trails you name it and it did it. It went awesome but the lease is now up. At 33k it still goes like new!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Truck ran fine until it hit 2,500 miles, then it was a check engine light, after getting truck back from dealer all warning lights would come on at the same time when the temperature got over 95 degrees outside and the truck would start cutting out and would not start on occasion. After being left stranded three times and no fix from Dodge we took a loss and traded it. Might have had better luck at a different dealer service department.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First off I must mention this truck has the old model 4.7L motor and not a Hemi or the 250HP 4.7L that came out later in 2007. The truck has been fun to drive aside from being a bit underpowered on the freeway. I have used the 4x4 on weekend excursions and the truck is plenty comfortable for longer vacations.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is by far the best truck I've driven or rode in. The 5.7 has nothing but power. Fuel economy around 18 on hwy at 65. Around 14 in city. The backseat is huge. I have a friend that's 6'4 and has plenty of leg room. The heated leather seats and sound system are awesome. I have no complaints. Compliments everywhere I go. I. Bought with intentions of a family vehicle and it will serve great for that and work. The rear room is more than any SUV or car. By far the best vehicle I've ever had.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only had it for about 2 months so far but it is truly awesome! I got the "ThunderRoad" edition, which (as best as I can tell) included bigger/better tires/rims, better stereo/speakers, and nerf step up bars. The ride is quite smooth and the interior is very comfortable. Obviously the mileage isn't "peak", but it's a V8 truck for heavens sake so that really shouldn't be a complaint for any owner - that said, however, I've averaged about 18.5 mpg so far and even have a cellphone snapshot of it hitting 21.1 mpg at one point (all highway driving obviously - but 21.1 in a V8 pickup truck...awesome!)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The high ride and the feeling of overall security. You drive the highway and don't feel you're being moved by a gust of wind off an 18- wheeler...oh, and speaking of, it's so quiet inside - I mean no road noise whatsoever! Oh yeah, and it's American company and American assembly - support the USA.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Overall this truck has been excellent for the money. My 07 4.7L Ram 4X4 has plenty of space and offers a very comfortable ride. Have had no problems except for with the 4WD system. I have 25K and have already had a problem with the front drive axles slipping off the front diff splines making it very difficult to drive in the snow. As of yet no word on whether Dodge will fix it under warranty. Transmission does shift difficult at times but other then that excellent mpg. ranging anywhere from 12-22MPG depending on city or freeway driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've always been a muscle car guy. When I test drove my 5.7 Hemi (Big Horn Edition) i enjoyed having that power on demand. This truck was the best value for the buck. Hands down. Plus the lifetime warranty is unmatched. I've had the truck for over a year now and have not had a single problem. Great for Hauling my muscle cars around! Actually gets better fuel economy while towing on the hwy! This is my first truck and what an amazing truck it is!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I own the 07 Ram 1500 SLT Quad Cab with the 4.7 V8 automatic. About every 2-3 months there's always something crapping out in it. Off the lot it had a module bad, that wouldn't allow the keys to program. Starting issues that are still not resolved because it wont duplicate when the techs are looking at it. Both fog lights broke. They fixed that. About 3 months later check engine light. Some canister failed. Took 2 weeks to fix that. 9 Month mark, trucks starts to pull. They replaced a bushing. Took 2wks for that, still pulling. They aligned my truck to a faulty machine..they admitted their machine was bad and got that fixed. Radiator fan will grind under heavy stress and engine temps. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Dodge. I love the truck but will not be able to keep it after warranty. The engine light comes on with regularity. Luckily warranty has covered the new computer, all the code checks, leaking shock, wind noise adjustments. Warranty has not covered my TIME to bring the truck in and wait. If Dodge could fix this issue I would love the truck but will not be able to afford it after the warranty. My advice, lease one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great truck so far. I was immediately attracted to the truck's appearance, but when I drove it I was very pleased with the ride and comfort. Nice quiet ride. I previously owned a Jeep Wrangler, and needed more room and more cargo space. The truck works quite well with our Child Seat and the occasional trip to Lowe's. I purchased the truck with the 4.7l V-8. It's a good engine for getting around the back roads where I live. I don't do much towing, although I did pull an enclosed trailer with ease. I also really like the simple and functional interior. I was raised on GMC's, so purchasing my Dodge was a risk, but so far I am very happy with my choice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Decent gas mileage, for a full size truck. Nice interior room. I love the looks of this truck. Ride is excellent, and very comfortable. Sits nice and high. Even though I did not purchase this vehicle to tow, it towed very well, the couple times I have towed. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I can't really say anything bad about the Dodge Ram. Its a very nice truck overall. Fuel mileage is about what is expected from the 5.7L Hemi. I average around 15mpg on constant short trips. The interior is very nicely layed out in 07 compared to past trucks. The radio is adequate. The amount of storage space in the cab is just amazing. Overall, if you really need a real truck, this is the one to get. If your looking for good gas mileage, look elsewhere. This is one truck that doesn't hide what it really is.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Mopar, and I love it (SLT 1500 BigHord w/5.7 Hemi MDS). I've always been a Ford fan, but with the price and all of the opions, it cannot be beat. Also, since DaimlerChrysler helped design parts for the U.S. Army's M1A1 Tank, they should be able to produce a great truck:) Need nurf bars if you or your spouse are shorter than 5'10" or a free hand to help pull yourself in. Love having 345hp if and when I need it. Gas mpg is acceptable for the power that can be unleashed - 17-20hwy 12-14city, learned to be more light footed.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The roomy interior is great when you have to haul two children around, and still have room your tools; mean, aggressive look; rear under the seat storage; and knowing the powertrain is covered for as long as I own my truck. Also, the chrome 20's look awsome and a Hemi!</FAVORITE>

I got the smaller V8 thinking better econ, but the Hemi seems to get 20 mpg, I avg 12-13 with city/hwy mix. Get power options (long reach to pass window), but get the cheapest radio they have and put your own system in. You think it won't matter, but with windows down at speed, you can't hear it. The 20" wheels look great (w/shortbed rough ride..but fun), get the 15" stock and put your own 18" wheels on.</TEXT>

<TEXT>A loyal Ram 1500 4x4 buyer: 1990, 1999, 2005 & most recently an '07. I had an '05 Ram 1500 quad 4x4 w/Hemi and was disappointed...Poor fuel mileage and a terrible ride. Fitment was also poor. Because I rarely used the 4WD I opted for the 2WD this time. I am very happy with my choice. I got a very good deal at the Dealership (a lost leader deal). With the 4.7 eng I get 20 MPG on the hi-way and it is still new. Off the line it keeps pace with the Hemi, but the Hemi is superior at higher speeds for raw get up and go. Never the less the 4.7 seems to be more than adequate. This revamped model seems to have ironed out the product line's prior deficiencies. It seems to be a very good value. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Opt for an SLT with the power seat, anti-slip rear-end, sliding r/window, auto trans, tow package and yes the floor mats are optional too. If I could only choose one option it would be the power seat. I can't quite get comfortible in the standard seating arrangement. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I got the SLT reg cab w/the Hemi, only one I've seen. I was looking at quadcab but suprising amount of room behind seat & I feel that it looks better; a real hot rod stance. Truck is big; size & ride hight seem a lot larger than Ford/Chev. I love the black prl (the crimson color is pretty, but couldnt get 1 w/the Hemi around here). The rack & pinion makes for easy manuvering over old-style idler/pitman arms, parking is no prob. I've put 6500mi on it -city traffic around 14-15mpg, I got 19 yesterday on the hiway at 85mph (thank you MDS). best was 23 on 40mi drive at 55mph. The Hemi is awesome! It pins you to the seat & goes right now. I hung with a Vette from a stop for 1mi. Get a radar detector.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Large dash knobs for radio/fan controls make for easy adjustments esp w/gloves. Some have said they didnt like the seats but I'm in my truck 6-8 hrs/day. They are wide, deep & supportive.

<TEXT>I just traded my 2005 Ram SLT1500 with 4.7 liter V8 for a 2007 Ram Big Horn Edition SLT1500 with 5.7 liter Hemi multi-displacement engine. I was looking for the higher tow rating and the lifetime warranty (however my 2005 had a nice extended Mopar 7/70 warranty on the powertrain). The 2007 is a wonderful truck. The Big Horn comes with 20 inch wheels that look super but may take a little away in the towing department. The Blue Tooth hook up is great as is the satellite radio. Both of those items are in demand and appreciated. The chassis is excellent for driving and pleasing to tow with. Nothing beats the look of a big Ram. I got a great deal too as the 2008's (with less rated HP) were here!</TEXT>

<TEXT>More than avg mileage on it first 9-months. Around town, yep, MPG falls to 13-15. My truck has Hemi with multi-displacement engine, since a lot of my 14,500 miles highway I see nearly 20 MPG! Thats pretty great considering size. My former vehicle a 4-Runner got around that MPG but 'hated' that thing! I have the big-daddy 20's and aluminum rims, look much hotter than chrome! All in all I love this truck. OK, one bad part, has had weird transmission issues. When placing in reverse a grinding meshing sound occurs sporadically. Its actually in shop now, I hated to take it in I love driving it. Providing that isn't a major long term issue I will be more than happy to recommend this truck 100%!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>20" tires and aluminum rims, MDI engine and nearly 20MPG on highway!, Sirius radio, under rear seat storage is great use of typically lost space, overall look, Love that it sits up 'high' but gotta have step side rails - I thought my Suburban was big - shoot - I had to "learn how to step up and in".</FAVORITE>

I had the 4.7 V-8 and got 19 MPG on the highway. I?m very dissatisfied with the mileage of the 1500. I know I got the Hemi. But I?m only getting 12.5 miles per gallon of mid-grade gas and I don?t gun it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the satellite radio. It gives me the stuff I want to listen to and few commercials. The radio controls on the steering wheel are just great. I don?t have to take my eyes off the road to change stations or volume. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this Dodge based on the styling, a short test drive and aggressive pricing I was able to obtain. After 3,600 miles, I am wishing I had checked a few of the options boxes differently or gone with the competition. I liked the looks of the 20" rim and tire package available as part of the "Big Horn" package. Living with this wheel and tire package on a daily basis is tough. The ride quality is horrible, especially on broken pavement but its not smooth even on fresh pavement. I have seen this complaint on other reviews and I would recommend not getting the 20" rims and tires. I also find the seats very stiff and lacking in upper lateral support. If your bigger this will be fine. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, 5.7 liter Hemi, decent mileage if your light on the gas, (I get 17-18 freeway) Satelite radio is awesome.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first Dodge and so far am extremely satisfied with the exception of the fuel economy. Best I have gotten on complete interstate driving at 70 mph is 15.6. Mostly I average around 13. That's after installing a Magna Flow exhaust system (added 1 - 1.5 mpg). Color, trim, wheels, etc. are amazing and people are always telling me how great it looks. Rides like a dream and plenty of power. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The smooth ride and power. Chrome wheels and 20" tires are worth it. Lots of storage. Sirius radio.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased my Quad Cab 1500 Laramie after looking at all of the major competitors. Each one offers nice features, but, the Dodge gave me the most for my money. Got the leather, premium wheels, Hemi, satelitte radio, power seats and much more for the same price as other Brands base models. It was too big of a difference to pass up!</TEXT>

<TEXT>There was no option for this trim level/cab config. with the 5spd auto, so I had to put this under the 6spd manual. This is my first brand new vehicle, and I love it. I've already put 850 miles on it in the first 8 days of ownership, had 30 when purchased. The 4.7 is more than adequate for the truck, despite a 4,500 pound curb weight. The 5 speed auto shifts smoothly, almost imperceptibly. Nice V8 rumble, even through the stock exhaust. Fit and finish seem to be top notch, on par with or better than my mom's '06 Sonata. Gauges are big and easy to read, nice aqua back-light. Enormous cab, more than enough room for even the tallest person. Roomy center console with the split bench seat.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Huge cab, huge center console with adjustable dividers, ample door panel storage space, ground clearance, fit & finish, white faced gauges, overhead console, nice factory wheels, keyless entry, power windows (never had a vehicle with them before.) Oh yeah, warranty... lifetime powertrain.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my fourth Ram P/U. First one was in 1999. Last one was in 2004 and was stolen. took a while to replace it,but was worth it. Hard to compete with Chryslers discounts. My seconed Black one, this time with Added Chrome Bling. Love the ride and HP on Demand. Great for Towing my new Searay. Will be Adding new chrome wheels soon to replace Factory 20" Fake chrome. Buy a black one and make it shine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Love this truck. I test drove different models of trucks for 3 weeks before I decided on the Ram. I could not be happier. Power, looks, style, you name it, this truck has it. The ride is so smooth it's like gliding down the highway. Expecting my first child and therefore took a close look at all features of the trucks I looked at. Hands down, Dodge took the cake. I get a safe vehicle for my wife and child. And, I still get to ride in a very sporty and great looking truck. Already had a garmin so didn't need the nav system or bluetooth. However, all of the other upgrades make this truck the king of trucks.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the smooth ride and the aggressive look of the exterior. The heated seats and dual side airconditioning are definitely a plus. I love the design of the leather seats and how the rear seats fold up to expose more storage and a fold down floor panel. This truck is a real head turner.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Happy after a month of riding this monster. Very quiet inside. Engine audible only during fairly heavy acceleration. Impossible to hear the Hemi while cruising. Powerful, comfortable. Responsive, sedan-like steering. Great braking ability. Stable in sharp turns. Love the Bluetooth handsfree phone system. Interior free of rattles or visible defects. Feels like a livingroom on wheels. For a smart shopper, the Laramie is worth the extra money. From other reviews it seems the SLTs have some interior quality issues, not the Laramie. Great truck for my family and our three dogs. It's early for conclusions but at this time the average gas mileage is 14-15 mpg - mostly freeway. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the 2007 Big Horn SLT 4Dr Quad Cab SB 5.7L HEMI. And I love that truck. More power than I need, but I like having it. The truck looks great sitting on those 20in rims. All around a very nice truck. I have not had any trouble at all with fit or fininsh, that was the only thing I was worried about before buying it. I guess the guy that put my truck together was on top of his game that day.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My new Ram replaced an '03 Ram Quad Cab. I am very pleased with the performance, handling and comfort of this vehicle, which is smaller and more fuel efficient than the Quad. The smaller 3.7 V6 engine is ideal for me as I do city driving but have the need for a full-size truck for hauling. I have owned Ford and GMC trucks previously and none of them gave as much power with a V6 as this truck does. Dodge has made a lot of refinements in looks, style, appearance and comfort with this truck. My vehicle has the SXT package which is a notch above the base ST model. It is well-equipped with power options, cruise, Sirius, offers good value and good looks for a very reasonable price. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Attractive dashboard layout, easy to read gauges, easy to read daytime and well-illuminated at night. Very good stereo sound for a factory-installed unit. Adding Sirius was a great addition. Fun to drive, maneuvers great. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the 3rd new truck that I bought, the first Dodge ever. Why a Dodge, well, it was the cheapest! It has power, plenty of it! Even with the upgraded 20 inch wheels and 35 inch tires it can tow almost anything with its Hemi. However, it has three problems, fuel is the biggest, never has it come close to what Dodge says it does, on average it gives about 11 MPG, 13 on the highway if the wind is behind you, 10 in town no matter how you drive. Another problem are the stiff seats, they are very uncomfortable after seating for about 30 minutes, I get off and sit in my brother's Chevy 2500, and immediatly notice the diference. The other problem is the off- center stearing wheel to the driver.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power. That says it all. It is a powerful truck. Not only that, its pearl coats on the paint looks great. Mine is very sexy with its flame metallic paint with pearl clearcoat, on lots of chrome. It's a head turner!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well this truck is just outstanding. With its 8,500 lbs in towing copacity it will easily cary my 4,600 trailer camper, and our 2,200 lb boat. It has room for all 5 of us with room to spare with its six passanger seating arangement. A real big look too. My neighbor said it looked like a little Mack truck. With a few accessories this will be a truck that turns heads, and hauls like a Ram. The short turning radius has even my wife happy. Thank you Dodge</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the look of the Dodge Ram 1500 Hemi. It has that man's man truck look and the power to back that look. Match that with the massive 20" chrome wheels and the truck has that "Git-outa-my-way" attitude that the competition works hard to protray,but never achieves.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hard miles with the minimum maintenence has stuck me on the Dodge truck. I purchased a used Dakota with 150k miles and sold it two years later with 214k before buying my Ram 1500. I was hoping that the Dakota wasnt a fluke because you know sometimes it just depends who was working the factory that Monday when you get those trucks that just keep on going. But my 1500 has not dissapointed yet, I've put a hard 52k in one year and it runs like it just finally got broke in.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The cruise is ergonomic and much better than the turn signal models. And I love that little space behind the seats, even in a regular cab you can recline a little bit.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> Have had three new style Dodge Ram 1500s. O2 O4 and my new '07 Amazing truck. Never had a problem with any of them. I pull a 9000lb car trailer. Truck is amazing, tons of power without initial expense of a Cummins Diesel. I call it my huge sports car. Handles like a dream, great styling. Huge interior (I need every inch of it, so if anyone would know its me..lol). New features such as remote start, sun roof, lane change signal flash, power delay relay after engine shut off are wonderful additions. People can't believe such a big truck can be so fast. Build quality superb.Nice fit and finish. Totally happy. Will buy another!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned 2 Ford F-150's and have nothing negative to report about them. However, I didn't know owning a truck could be so grand until I purchased my new Ram 1500. The difference in power is amazing. I barely touch the accelerator and the Hemi can throw you in the back of your seat. Styling? I get looks all the time! I highly recommend the Dodge product - the truck represents raw, rugged power. And isn't that why you want a truck? I just got this truck and already looking forward to my next Ram (the Mega Cab!) in a couple of years, if things work out anyway. Go get the Dodge Ram - you will be very happy you did.</TEXT>

My dad has a Chevy w/ a tonneau cover and gets 20 MPG highway with it on and 17 MPG with it off, my truck without one gets 19 MPG, I'm looking to invest in one to see how good I can get.

With a cold air intake, throttle body spacer, true dual exhaust with Flowmaster muffler and a power chip the truck is hard to handle. Pushing around 440hp. Ford and Chevy haven't got anything on that hemi.</TEXT>
