<TEXT>This is it, great truck for the money. Rides like a expensive car, do not even feel the transmission shift.Two years and still get compliments. Powerful V8, pushes me back in the seat. Leather seats are great for long rides, COMFORTABLE. Great sales person at dealership, still checks on me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I couldn't be happier with this truck. We just turned in our Mercedes R-class and bought this '07 leftover. It rides better than the Mercedes by a long shot and it's a heck of lot more fun to drive. It has everything we wanted including Nav and RES. I'm looking forward to many many years of driving this thing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought used in December 2008. First car payment and not impressed yet. Tranny had to be worked already. Supposely had the certified check over and they forgot to reset oil light and do the recall tranny then. Hope this is not the beginning of seeing the dealer every month. Gas mileage is terrible reads only 12.3 avg. But I love the look and the interior especially the leather seats and dual climate control. Have not haul anything yet. I so far enjoy it though</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first SUV after a series of three mini-vans. The Explorer is very well built with no rattles or squeaks. Since it is built on a truck frame, the ride can be a little rough on certain terrain. I really wanted a Tahoe, but the Eddie Bauer Explorer comparably equipped was 10K less. It is a little smaller vehicle, but for 10K it was worth the difference. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This vehicle is full of safety features. I like the styling and the quality of the build. The power third row seats and power step-rails are nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love my Explorers, this is 4th one to lease and least expensive, RWD V6 in high $20's others were EB 4X4V-8's near$40G. Never any trouble with any of them, very safe, do almost anything when safely handled. Lowered ground clearance such a plus in ride experience. Get higher mileage lease, you will want to drive it everywhere. Great stereo, Great Visibility, V6 is sluggish when punched, V8's were great and mileage diff miniscule between the two. Power to pull most anything, didn't even need 4x4 on last one in NE OH winter, RWD just fine too. XLT int fabric is boring. Get the leather & heated seats, fantastic. Recommend for anyone with good taste and who expects more from their vehicles</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very safe feel, command of road conditions, sharp frt end looks, classy SUV, nice 18" tires & alum rims on relatively less expensive model, good mileage 19-25, great stereo- Sirius ready, mp3 plug</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the best Ford I have evere owned. My family are Ford truck buyers. This truck is excellent in design and performance. The interior is high quality leather and very quite. Having the fold flat third row seats is something that is essential when hauling kids or large items. The fuel economy isn't that bad considering that there is a 300 hp V8 in it. I get an avg of 19 mpg. This is a great buy for truck lovers or families.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned an Explorer previously and it was great! Something went seriously wrong with this model. Since I have had it (9 months), I have had the e-brake handle break, the rear struts go out, the seat belt actually come apart, and my drivers seat control panel fall completly off. I didn't even have my car back a week from the mechanic and then this morning water came leaking through the buttons for the reading lights(and no I did not leave my sunroof open). The dealership said one of the drain tubes for the sunroof must have a problem and they would need if for at least three days. So if you cannot tell, no I would not recommend this vehicle, nor would I recomend any Ford prior to 2004.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our 07 in 07 and have over 20k on the clock. It is an awesome road trip car and tows my 4k lb boat very well even with just the V6 (make sure to get 373 gears) we get 19-20 mpg in mixed driving. Bad weather is joke with the traction control and auto 4wd. I wish I had better mpg but it's a body on frame truck that ways 4000+ and has 373 gears, it's only going to do so well. All in all it does very well hauling, towing, and cruising, and I always enjoy driving it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This Explorer rocks! The most stable and quite vehicle that I have ever owned. I have the 4.6L V8 which has been at 19 mpg city/hwy combined. The only thing that I don't like is the 6 spd tranny. It makes the V8 lag. Should of put the 5 spd that comes with V6. Good quality interior parts. Smooth looking exterior for a truck. Explorer has 13K miles with no problems so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this Explorer almost a year ago and have zero problems. I am very happy with it thus far. The 4WD plows throw snow and mud. The traction control is also great in icey conditions. I love the safety features for the family. Everyone who rides along is confortable and satisfied to the fullest. First times usually cant find the exit handle, but I think its kinda funny. The V8 has plenty of power, but hay I could always use a little more. My one compaint is the amount of interior plastic. Come on, can't we spring for something a little more solid.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just purchased our 07' Explorer and we love it. I have done about 1 years worth of research and had narrowed it down to either the Honda Odyssey or the Explorer. We choose the Explorer because we are still very young and wasn't ready to go to the mini-van yet. This Explorer so far has been great, drives smoothly, no sounds, very stylish and lots of extra room which is very important to us with having 2 small children. If you are looking for a new ride with plenty of room for your family, and cargo storage this one is it. Gas mileage is also pretty good, we get around 22 mpg which isn 't bad considering that it is an SUV, although there is always room for improvement.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned a lot of Fords and this is the worst. The V8 with the 6 speed transmission lurches from 1st to 2nd gear and again when slowing it feels like you've been rear ended. Ford has issued a lot of TSBs and none can fix the problem. Dealer won't or can't do anything for you, and Ford is playing the deaf ear. Mines been in the shop 6 times, had a Ford engineer confirm the problem, and they still won't buy the darn thing back. I'm going the Lemon Law route to get them to take the lemon back. Too bad for Ford!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This iteration of the Explorer has been given a bad rap by the Consumer Reports mavens. It's a competent, comfortable, reliable ride with only one bad habit: it drinks too much. If you need serious hauling capacity, sweet highway manners, bad-weather & bad road capability, and aren't averse to a little interior luxury, this ride deserves a look. I've had it for almost a year, and it's been a pleasure from day one. It laughs at winter (and we've had a bad one so far).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Mustang V8 and the 6-speed tranny. Power and pep, smoothly delivered. There's serious cargo capacity in this vehicle--biggest among all the competitors I checked out. The 4Runner was my 2nd choice, partly for this reason.</FAVORITE>

Dashboard is elegant, and instrument panel are easy to read. Great features, such as suede, heated seats, memory seats and on-board computer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a 1 year old rental through a dealer - $20K less than new price. Alternatives considered were mini-vans (domestic and Japanese), other mid size Japanese SUVs. Though reputation was strong for Toyota, I found Highlander was very cheap feeling and felt I was doing better here. After 4 months with the vehicle, I am very happy with it. No problems, good fuel economy (highway) though nasty when driving only short distances in town with a cold engine. Traction and control in Canadian winter is amazing, easily able to take logging roads that left other vehicles stranded - with barely a reaction from the traction control system.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Picked up the Explorer in March of 07, so far it has been one of the best SUVs that I have owned. Taking it to Vegas twice getting about 22mpg. Feels and handles great. Acceleration from 0- 40 great no problems at all. I opted for the V-6 engine since I only drive on the highway and don't do any heavy towing. DVD Entertainment system was a must for my 2 year old daughter. Overall I am very happy with my Ford.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my explorer for about a year now and i still hate it. first off i'm a mountain biker. When i tried to haul a trailer full of weight weenis CrossCountry mountain bikes the Explored bogged down. also there needs to be some fairly substantial mud flaps on this car. Very disapointing V8. No one can figure out where the inner door handles are and the outside look is about as plain as you can get. this car is unbelievably clumsy and lurpish in real 4 wheelin situations i don't trust it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2007 Explorer rides very well, the seats are comfortable, and the interior noise is minimal. The driver buttons/controls are well laid out. The tan leather seats look dirty after six months, and the leather does not continue into the rear pockets in the seat backs. The V8 drives nicely, and the transmission is very smooth, except when coming to a stop, where it jerks forward and makes a clunking sound when from 2nd to 1st gear. The dealer recalibrated the transmission...issue is not resolved at this time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We just are getting to the one year anniversary of our Explorer. We love it! Plenty of room for our kids and their soccer, baseball, volleyball stuff, etc. We just finished a trip to Houston, about 350 miles round trip and got our best mpg yet, a little over 22 hwy! That was with mid-grade fuel and running 75 mph for the most part with some Houston traffic built in. Here's hoping the 2nd yr report is as positive! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Ford really hit a home run with the Ironman package! Not only do I like exterior appearance with the black cladding but the two-tone interior against the metal look dash sets off nicely. The heavy duty rubber floor mats are perfect for an SUV. The only thing Ford could do better is fit and finish. They do such a good job everywhere else I hope that they can get everything to line up better in future models. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had my Explorer for just over 3 weeks now and just love it! I have had Ford Trucks for about 18 years and wanted something with more room. It drives so much nicer than a truck and I find myself alot more comfortable in the Explorer. I love the chrome both inside and out and feel that Ford made some great choices on the interior. Sure the rear headrests are big but I just fold them down and have no problem seeing out. The V-6 is fine for me since I don't plan on hauling anything and the ride is nice and smooth, handling is great! The Explorer is built solid and has a great design with quite a bit of room inside. I'm lovin' it! and feel you would also...</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gosh I love just about everything. The keypad is a nice touch, Satellite radio is cool, Machined aluminum wheels, Lighted outside mirrors, Auto dimming rear view mirror is great at night... and of course the five star ratings in all frontal- and side- impact crash tests!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I drove the Toyota 4 Runner, Jeep, Hummer H3, Comander and Nissan Pathfinder. All were OK but the Explorer won out. It had more room and the ride was great. I had a 95 and this one stickerd for $5,000 less with similar options etc. I cannot believe how much better it got in 2 years. I got the Iron Man because I do not like to be a little different. Unlike the 05 the back is totally flat. I just love this SUV. I am 62 and drive on the beach so a 4X4 was a must. I had 0 porblems with the 05 with just over 40.000 miles. I leased that one. I bought this one because I plan on keeping it 10 + years and put to many miles on the last one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 98 Expedition in on my new Eddie Bauer Explorer. I loved my Expedition and had a hard time giving it up. Have been driving the Explorer for a little over a month now and no major complaints, this truck is pretty awesome. My rear headrests fold down, so no obstruction visually. The looks of the Explorer inside and outside I really like, more so than any other mid-size SUV I looked at. A friend of mine bought one and I guess seeing it a lot it sort of grew on me. His "roof console" came loose a few months after he bought it, but the dealer took care of it no charge. So far so good with this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Eddie Bauer Explorer. I needed to special order to get a 5-passenger V-8 with the leather/suede interior. It was worth the wait. As the vehicle is routinely loaded with 400 - 900 pounds of cargo, the V-8 was a must. This Explorer has a base weight 500 lbs. more than the '98 V-6 it replaced and the V-8 is needed for decent performance when loaded. Around town mileage is about 13 with vehicle not yet broken in. This is about the same as my past V-6. The added size vs. the past model makes it the max. that will fit in our garage, and one mirror must be folded to do so. Good build quality and, overall, still the best of mid-size SUVs but see below for design-related concerns.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The suede seats are cool on hot days and comfortable on cold days. The added size of the current model enhances ease of carrying bulky items. The independent suspension improves ride/handling over the previous generation.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have not owned the Explorer long but so far we love it. We really planned on buying a Tahoe, but we bought the Explorer similarly loaded for $9,000 less. Of course, the Tahoe is a little bigger and we actually thought it drove just a little better than the Explorer, but not 9K worth. The Explorer seems solid as a rock, no rattles or squeaks whatsoever.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power folding seats are great. The surface is really flat when the seats are folded all the way down. We really like the layout of the dash and the exterior appearance, especially the chrome wheels.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just bought mine this month and it's a nice car, but there could be some improvement. Like the floor mounted shifter gets in the way when I'm driving and trying to change the A/C setting or when I'm trying to look for on coming traffic and the oversized rear headrest get in the way; both 2nd and 3rd row. And there seem to be a little bit of lag in the 6 cylinder engine in range acceleration. Other than that everything else is good and since I keep the 3rd seat folded down I can at least see out of the rear window. Rear quarter windows are a different story.</TEXT>

<TEXT>'07 E.B. Explorer 4x4 V8 is our 5th Explorer/Mountaineer since 1997. Our new Explorer is the best riding and quietest by far. We do get some wind noise on the highway but the interior cabin is very quiet. We opted for the 'preferred Suede' seating. It's soft to the touch and my wife I are happy because neither one of us like leather (it all feels like Vinyl to us.) The ride is very comfortable. Access to controls are good. We don't know if the climate control has a problem or if there's a design issue, but we have to keep the temp at 76 or higher to stay warm. Not thrilled about the huge headrests in the 2nd row - blocks view so we folded them down. V-8 doesn't 'seem' as powerful?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have test driven almost every SUV and crossover in the market that were all similarly priced. I have never owned an Explorer in the past, but this is an unexpected pleasure. This truck is one of the best SUV's that I have ever driven. The ride is quiet and smooth and I don't know why it has been written that the Explorer V-8 needs more power, this truck can haul! Low end and highway. The interior is smartly designed and easy to navigate though. The Nav system and DVD system are also very easy to use. The sound system is outstanding.

<TEXT>Pick up the truck 2 days ago. During the first 2 days of ownership, I have to say that we enjoy the truck very much, quiet, smooth, wonderful stereo (audiophile) equipment, user friendly DVD and fully integrated Nav system. Independent suspension is probably one of the best in the market. Ventilated disks are very responsive. The award winning V8 definitely deserves its reputation as one of the top 10 engine of the world. The gas mileage is the same as Duratec V6 and is better than most trucks in the market including Japanese competitors.</TEXT>

Had to hunt around NJ to find a XLT with a V8 and the 2007 appearance package, which makes it look a lot cleaner. The new V8 is awesome, quiet with a little growl when stepped on. Very smooth acceleration. Would not buy the V6, just too slow. Extremely quiet and confident ride. Also, the best thing about any Explorer that nobody talks about is that the seats are very comfortable. Perfect seating for cruising around with your arm hanging out the window on a nice day. Like a real truck. </TEXT>
