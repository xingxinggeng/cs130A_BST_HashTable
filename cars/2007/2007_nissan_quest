<TEXT>I got this van for more room when I had my second child. Not that I have 3 things are starting to look "gray"! I love the seats and actually think they are comfortable except the third row is not made for adults or more than 2 car seats. My recline handles on my second row seats have broken on both sides twice! The interior is very cheaply made and not worth the money on any model. There are only 2cup holders in the front which is a hassle. It drives great and is awesome on long trips. In town the gas mileage stinks. I wish we would have done more looking before we purchased this van. I do love the power and reliability. So I love a little and hate a little. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This van has been a sorry purchase from the start. 7 months after we got it, I called the nav number and they told me I needed to buy a new $280 disc as any addresses newer than 5 years in Houston could not be located, next the tires have gone bald after only 32K miles, Nissan canceled this feature and now we are to pay for all new tires and sensored rims as Michelin or Nissan will come thru. It is cheaply made and has all the packages on it, even tho we can't get some to work. Head rests are uncomfortable, also leg room on front passenger side. For the price it's an utter failure and can't believe Nissan won't stand by owners problems</TEXT>

<TEXT>This van is drives like a car. We used to have a Honda Odyssey, and the Quest definitely drives like a car. We have used in around town and for long cross country trips, and the van performed well under both scenarios. Interior space is good for the driver and in the second row. Whenever I have been seated in the front passenger seat it doesn't feel comfortable. The 3rd seat row is very cramped and the bench seat back is too short. Definitely not a place for adults.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car 1 1/2 yrs ago & have no problems with it at all. About the front seats, the upper lumbar is angled too far back so you never really can press your back against it. I love the interior, very spacious inside although the ext design makes it appear more sleek. I recently took it for a 1000K mile trip w/ 3 adults and 3 children. It was very easy ride, comfortable and felt safe. Lots of power and gas mileage was very good on hwy. It sure stinks in the city though (15/24). </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car because my wife wanted her dogs to have easier access to get in. It is a beautiful van! Mileage is not what they tell in the city. Its way better on long vacation trips. So don't by this one unless you can afford the expense to have it. It takes some work to keep it clean inside. So in other words this better be your second car. Specially with the games they play with the cost of gas. When gas was at its most expensive, close to $5 a gallon, it cost almost $70 to fill up. Now that gas prices have fallen to $1.50 in our area, its under $30 a tank. Is the inside as good as I saw 4 years ago. No. I miss the center console idea, I saw in another friend's Quest.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior is beautiful. Inside materials could be better for what you have to pay. Even at the cheapest model. Too much plastic for a $30,000 car. For a van engine is great. It sounds like a race car when you speed up!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wow, a great looking "minivan"? I was completely impressed with the modern design, sporty look, awesome 27 mpg hwy etc. I've had the van for 1.5 years and am worried about reliability. All automated doors/sensors/gauges are giving me funny issues like doors sticking, sensors going out. Then I had to replace the tires at 30k runflats. Only one tire is available at $350 apiece!! So I need a truck now and am giving the van to my wife since I cannot sell it until it's paid off. After 1.5 years only worth 19k trade in. This van has everything skyview, dvd, nav, etc. and it dropped 20k in 2 years. I'll never buy Nissan again! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Modern design, good gas mileage, cool feel for a minivan. Nice leather, functional dvd, great xtra features if they worked (only 32k miles) nice rims.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We drive that car on horrible northern Canada roads and up to now (2 years of ownership) absolutely no problem with it. We knew the Odyssey reliability is better than the Quests, but the price and style of the Quest finally got us, and we do not regret at all. The front seats are not very comfortable, but the rest is good. Good value for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>While our van is still fine, I don't see it holding up well over the test of time. I researched many makes and models before settling on the Quest. This was my first van purchase - going from a convertible sports car to a minivan, I found the Quest to be the most stylish looking on the market. Our tire sensors are always lit on the dashboard - very annoying. When we got 500 miles on the van, we had to have a fuel pressure tank (or something like that replaced.) It sat on the dealership lot for 30 days before it was fixed. Overall, I wish I'd spent a little more money on a higher end van. Nothing has broken so far but I fear it's just a matter of time. Very cheaply made inside.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>DO NOT BUY!!!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>We traded our 04 quest for an 07 quest. Huge mistake. The 04 is nothing like the 07 at all. Storage is very limited. Seats are uncomfortable. Air barely blows any air. Heat takes forever to heat up and blow. Cloth seats get very dirty due to pattern chose on material. Lots of things that are plastic have broken, air vents, cup holders, etc. It gets horrible gas mileage. I drive to school and back and I use a tank in three to four days. That is going nowhere else approx. 14-17 mpg... not good at all! Not very roomy. Our sliding door kept popping dealership said couldn't fix when window shattered in a million pieces!! DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Four bucket seats. Seven seating arrangement. DVD player with cordless head phones. Seats fold flat when have to carry big items. DVD player up front for easy access for parents instead of under seat like the 04 quest. Love the look of the QUEST!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I purchased this car, I loved the features. Now, almost two years later, I regret buying it. While still very pretty, for a mini van, every thing is breaking. The rear cup holders, the rear sonar, the rear cover. Every little piece of plastic that can break is breaking. I could understand if I was hard on the vehicle. But it is mostly city driving, which the mileage is horrible, 11-13 miles per gallon. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded in a European luxury sedan for the Quest, an appropriate car for a growing family. Both me and my wife drive the van and it takes time to get used to it but once you get over the gas pedal softness, it becomes comfortable. Has ample power and gets OK gas mileage. Some of the materials they used to make the car are cheap and breakable. The only problem so far is the tire pressure sensor. Knowing that there are problems with the sensor by reading similar reviews, it seems like Nissan should have a recall for it. It accommodates 7 comfortably. From the outside, it is better designed than that the other box vans that you see on the road. The kids love it because of the ample space.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great family car. Have had ours for about ten months and 5,000 miles. No problems. Highly recommend the car, and have no regrets what so ever. Take a look to see how many recalls there have been on the 07 quest, and you will understand why I think so highly of it The only draw back is the lack of snow tires for this vehicle (225-65-16).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this van with 3 miles on it! I wanted a family car and I really liked the way the quest looked. Thus, I bought one. This was the worst purchase I have ever made! It has been to the dealership 7 times since March! I have had 4 tire sensor problems, that the dealership can't fix! I also had a mildew smell coming out of my vents! The dealership told me that something could have crawled into the van and DIED and that this would not be covered under my warranty! I would have to pay for them to fix this problem! A brand new van!!! Finally, the dealership has the smell in the vents fixed, but the tire sensor is still flagging and the van doesn't qualify as a lemon per Nissan. DO NOT BUY!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought a new '07 Quest last weekend. We liked the looks of the "un-minivan" but choice for an entry level model was very limited. They really move these models so you don't get much selection. The interior room was light years ahead of our 1999 Quest. Power was nice also. Did not get leather but cloth interior looks cheap and probably prone to catch dirt in the waffle pattern. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We compared it to our 1999 Quest. Lots of room in all three rows. Love flat folding seats. Wide doors are nice. Real 5 speed tranny, none of that CVT crap. Excellent passing power. No expensive run-flat tires.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Trade in 1999 Mercury Villager (Quest clone) with 120K miles. Except for tach, everything still worked. We thought that the Nissan Quest would be as reliable and useful but now we are wondering if the extra cost of a Honda or Toyota would have been a better choice. Maybe we should have bought used. On the way home, the button that slides the seatbelt adjuster up and down broke and fell into the door post. This was after 30 minutes of ownership. Three days later, my wife tells me that the A/C does not seem to blow as cold as it did when we got it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Much bigger and roomier than our old minivan. Power to spare, especially when loaded with 4 grandkids. Love the regular instrument location and dash mounted shifter. Center instrument cluster would have been a deal breaker. Thank goodness no CVT but a nice 5 speed. Flat folding seats are great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Quest is a great van, I even managed to get 32 miles per gallon, (cruise at 67 miles per hour). On the other hand there are two main problems with the car, first front driver side seat moves. Second the tire bounces, but that is not a Quest problem that is a Goodyear problem, you cannot balance the tires the only way to eliminate this problem is to have the dealership replace the tires. Nissan dealer tested 16 tires before they found 4 good ones ? test was called road force, it fails every time. It?s not dangerous it?s only irritating. I also had problems with vibration while braking while driving through hills of West Virginia.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First the bad news after 500 mile road trip. Front seats don't provide the comfort/quality support that second row seats do. Longer seat bottoms like the second row would be the fix for tall guys. The seat covering on front of the driver and passenger seats bottoms will not stay attached to the seat pan. I noticed this in the first 30 miles. It's on my list to fix. The hood, headlights and grille don't line up correctly. Gaps are off on lift gate. Low speeds 18-22 MPH on gravel roads leaves the trans hunting for right gear. Not enough storage areas. Steering wheel is too far from driver when seat is back. Tires vibrate even after dealer balanced them before I took delivery.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Now for the good. Power is great due to gearing and trans combination. Design looks good. Drives well with good balance between sporty and comfort. Standard features on base model are all you need. Extra light when turn signals are on. Open feel. Quiet, conversation easy amongst all passengers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I initially purchased a 2004 Nissan Quest SE and I absolutely loved it (DVD player didn't hurt). My 17-year old son was involved in a bad accident in my 2004 Quest. He walked away without a scratch; the car suffered all the front end damage but my son had not one scratch. Unfortunately, my 2004 Quest had to be totalled because it absorbed all of the energy and the frame was crumpled behind the engine. Well - I had 2 days to shop for a vehicle and I kept coming back to the Quest. I bought the 2007 Nissan Quest 3.5S in chestnut brown - it is a beautiful car and my 8 yr-old twins love the car. I highly recommend the Quest.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I swore I would never buy a minivan again, but I'm glad that I took a chance on the "un-minivan," as Nissan has touted it. It feels like a car to drive, handling and driving so well you forget you are in a minivan. The stereo is great, and the spacious interior is wonderful. I had 3 large SUVs before going back to a minivan, and I don't miss a thing! The cargo bay is great for groceries and the captains chairs are a nice feature, as are the dual DVD players for both the second and third rows.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased a 2004 nissan quest se, it was good to us. I feel comfortable knowing my family is safe, my wife tested that, thankfully the van passed and my family walked away, the van made a full recovery. I take that heavily. So in respect to the van I looked for another and bought my 2007 se. It's like falling in love all over. We checked out the competition but found things we didn't like in all of them. Now the Quest, that's a cool Dad, a happy wife, and an entertained 4 year old - did I mention dual 8" screens and skyviews. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Very nice outlook. Looks classy, drives good but not at all reliable. Electronics inside the car trouble you frequently. We have been to dealership once every three months with problems. They can't call it a lemon but can't figure out the problems either. Nissan extended our warranty which did not help. High end vehicle such as Quest should be more reliable. If you are planning to get 100K out of this, be prepared to have 2nd or 3rd car handy. Tires wear out quickly (unusual category of Goodyear tire). Gearshaft gets locked (I could not move it from Park to Drive. It got stuck at passenger pick up area in the airport, fun!). None of my impressions are exaggerated.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Plastic bumpr unsafe</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Someone rear-ended me and I got a horrible whiplash and the rear was bent badly at 30 mph. Turns out that the rear bumper is made of PLASTIC, not a steel bumper like the Toyota Sienna. Also, the headrests are ergonomically wrong because they are too far back so it does NOT protect you from a whiplash. The Nissan Quest also rides too low to the ground so it tends to scrape things and the long wheelbase got me scraping the pavement which took out a baseball size hole in my the van's body. The wheelbase is too long so turning radius is huge so you can't make a U-turn and parking is difficult because it always require backing up and forth.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This van offers style & performance for those of us who still love driving but need to accommodate lots of passengers & gear. The sky view package adds a unique airiness to the interior & the kids love it. With the skyview package, there are 2 TV monitors for the integrated DVD w/ 2 cordless headphones so adults can listen to radio when the kids are watching a movie The rear view camera/sonar system is indispensable for the reverse- driving-challenged. The foldaway seating is easy to use, & the interior design has thoughtful, practical details. Definitely order the PAX/Navigation package if you like the latest technology (I didn't & wish I had). The low city gas mileage is the only downfall</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a guy who has to drive a minivan. To be honest, I didn't even look at or consider any other minivan. Nissan is the only one that had any kind of style. I did wait until the 07 models due to the previous quality and design issues. We've had it 5 months and we have not had any problems. It looks great, rides smooth, the interior has a clean, modern feel and it handles exceptionally well for such a big van. Everything is in reach and works as advertised. The red chili seats look great with the gray exterior and trim and they look unlike any other minivan. My only problem is getting the kids out of the van, they like it so much!</TEXT>

There is no other mini van model that provided the features that the nissan quest comes with. The only feature that I missed on the quest is that it doesn't come with the turn indicators on the side view mirrors and the rear windows are fixed. Gives u the best features that u could get for the named price. The best comfort that ur $'s could get you. Overall layout of the gadgets is one of a kind. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at both the Nissan Quest and the Honda Odyssey. Pricing was about the same as I purchased the top end vehicle. I drive a lot and wanted comfort. The interiors of both the Quest and the Odyssey are well done, good looking and functional. Exterior wise, the Quest makes the Odyssey look like a cardboard box. Honda does stick it to you though, every bit of trim is high priced and extra. Drivability, is the Quest's side. The Honda has loose steering and hesitates on acceleration. I could say a lot more, but between the two, buy the Quest. It is the hands down choice. And you do not have to deal with the Honda Arrogance and high interest rates for financing. </TEXT>

<TEXT>i'm one of those "i will never drive a minivan" people. then i became a parent, and quickly realized that the only way to successfully transport said baby and his entorage was do (gulp) get a bigger car! we looked at toyota and honda before settling on the quest. for the price, it had a lot of the features that cost $10K more in the ohter two brands! not to mention it was by far the best looking...not that hideous girly shape. we also LOVE all the interior room, and the 3.5 engine (same one as the z car) has a lot of get-up-and-go that i totally didn't expect. i enjoy driving it in spite of myself, and my son's car seat goes in and out effortlessly. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We are new to the minivan thing so i can only say moving from the 2005 Nissan Altima I am very pleased with the Quest so far. Drivability has been great, it handles very well for a minivan and has plenty of room to boot. Looking at the 06 model versus the 07, I have to say they are moving the design in the right direction on the styling.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The fold down seats are very handy and it expands the capabiliy of the van a lot IMHO.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought this van after looking at the Honda, Entourage and Town & Country. The Entourage and T&C left a bit to be desired and the Honda packaging options meant we were spending a lot of money for some options we wanted and a lot for some we didn't. The main option we would've liked but wasn't available was AWD. The interior was by far the nicest of all the vans and although there wasn't as much storage as the Honda (lazy susan in floor), the fact that no seats had to be removed to have cargo space really helped.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall I can't imagine being more happy in any other van, but I wouldn't give 10s to anyone, hence the 9s. It drives and handles a little better than our 2004SE. Controls are more intuitive. Although still getting used to the new information display, it's been very nice so far. Overall arrangement is a little crammed, and the center storage area disappoints. Although that could just be my unique way of using storage areas, unquestionably if you liked the ability in 2004 models to swing your legs around to get in the back area from the front, that's no longer easy to do. Phone and DVD systems work very well and the audio ROCKS! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just traded in our 04 Quest SL for an 07 Quest SL. Our 04 had 34,000 miles on it and never once had to be returned to the dealership, other than for routine maint. We've only had the 07 for a week so there isn't a lot about reliabilty to report yet, We are most impressed with the power/smoothness of the 3.5L engine and 5 speed auto transmission. This 07 seems even more refined than the 04 in fit/finish. We were glad to see the addition of left side sliding door and traditional location for speedometer over steering wheel. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DVD and Stereo system, right/left sliding doors, easy stow 2nd and 3rd row seating. Most comfortable and spacious layout of all current competition.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my new '07 Quest on a Thursday and left on Friday for a 4,600 mile trip with 2 kids 6 and 7. The built in DVD player is great, so are the wireless headphones! The ride is smooth and overall my Quest is very comfortable! I love the extra options in the minivan that I did not have with my Tahoe and I really like the increased gas mileage!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The builtin DVD and wireless headphones The automatic slide passenger doors and rear door</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have tested Odyssey, Sienna and Quest. We wanted to buy anything other than Quest as we were bored with Nissan in the past. Sienna was good and were about to buy it but when we test drove 07 Quest SE fully loaded, we were pleasantly surprised. Steering is much smoother, accelaration for once outpaces Sienna. Interior: leg space is much better than Sienna and with multiple skylights, my daughter fell in love with it. Ride is superb and very comfortable interior, it is a sheer joy for our family. It was more expensive than Sienna 06 XLE but is superior and rollover testing was also excellent (highway safety...). Until a redesigned Sienna or Honda Odyssey are available, 07 Quest seemed best!</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>engine stalls</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Engine stalls and will leave you stranded, vents don't close so you always smell the outside or get hot/cold feet, sliding door does not close properly because it keeps reversing, many rattles and squeaks, vents in the ceiling keep falling, dealers don't know how to fix things so you keep going back to fix the same thing. Dealer does not do an oil change when that's what I asked them to do because oil is still dirty and they said that's the color of their oil but when I took it back a week later for an oil change, it's a clean and clear color. Tires are a weird size and are very expensive because only Goodyear sells them.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>low price but you get what you pay for and that's no reliability.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We compared the new Quest with both the Toyota and Honda vans and this newest version outpaced both. The comfortable seating that folds flat both in the second and third rows, the larger interior volume, stylish exterior, skyview roof all were Quest advantages, but it's greatest attributes are it's driving and handling qualities. It simply out runs and outhandles the competition hands down. We have not had the Quest a long while yet but so far, we are really impressed and love this Nissan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I Purchased 2007 Nissan Quest SE (Smoke color with gray leather interior) recently from Fairfax Nissan. This minivan is loaded with cool features, very comfortable ride. Yet to test the fuel economy on this. Dual screen DVD is a plus and 10 speaker Bose system with 6 CD changer and MP3 playback is sweet. Automatic seat adjustments and heated seat options are well thought of. The tech package includes Bluetooth connectivity to the cell phone. Unfortunately, my cell phone is Audiovox and it is not listed as its compatible phones. So, yet to test this feature. Overall, very satified with the car. The second row fold away is good option, but doesn't completely folds flat.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dual screen DVD, MP3, Seat positions memory, rearview camera, and the PAX system. Though not tested yet, the hands free Bluetooth connectivity for Cell phones sounds great.</FAVORITE>
