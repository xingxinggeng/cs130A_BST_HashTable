<TEXT>The compact size for parking ease, great old-school styling, reliability and 4.0 V6 power are the major features that caused me to buy the Ranger over the competitors. I have not been disappointed, after 32,000 miles and 3 years I'd buy it again. I manage to get 16 city and 22 highway by being careful and using cruise control when I can. More than enough power for heavy loads and towing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Just a lot of fun to drive compared to the many other vehicles I have owned! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I'm an assistant ranger at a Boy Scout camp. We do a lot of work and rely on good trucks. This Ranger is the best truck we've ever had, great little workhorse. Does everything that our F-150 and Silverado can do, and is better off-road, especially on hiking trails in the woods. I've hauled trash, lumber, dirt, gravel, stone, concrete, tools, trailers, boats, even another truck. In 3 years it's gotten pretty beat up at camp, but I'm confident it will last for many more years, then we'll buy another one. Starts up every time, 4wd is great on dirt roads, engine gives just enough power, and it just drives and works like a bigger truck. Love this Ranger!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine is perfect for fuel economy--we're on a budget. 4wd gives it great traction, especially on hilly dirt roads with a full bed. Trans is nice and smooth--no complaints when shifting.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The greatest thing about the Ranger is it just flat out works. Yes there are other newer trucks out there, but for the money it is hard to get any better than the Ranger. I have had no problems with it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the stance of my Ranger. I have the 4X4 XL regular cab. With this package it just looks right. It has the best proportions and the cab has just the right fit for 2 people. Bigger families look other places.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned 2 Rangers do far and loved both. Bought my 07 with 250 miles on it, and have put 38,000 miles on it with out a single issue. I would buy another Ranger at the drop of a hat. My Ranger gets 22 miles per gallon, only after some aftermarket parts, but I love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I'd have to say the 4-wheel drive and the 4.0L are the best features of the XLT 4x4. I wanted the bucket seats, but the dealer didn't have them on the lot.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this truck used. I had a 1991 Ranger that was pretty worn out and would finally start needing some repairs so I bought this one. Previously a fleet vehicle I was impressed with all that I got for 11,500 dollars. XL truck, but with 5 speed auto, and 4.10 axle ratio, extras were A/C (necessary in Ohio) and an under-rail bed liner. It had a little over 18000 miles on it. I work in a scrap yard and needed a solid truck. That's just what I got with fuel economy averaging 23-28mpg combined city/highway. Drives like a bigger truck and so quick too; especially for a four cyl. engine. Much stronger than my 1991's 2.3liter. No serious rattles, and white so scratches are not an issue.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cup holders are standard on all trucks, great stock bed liner. Far better fuel economy than driving the F-250 I used to use when I needed a truck. Fun to drive. My wife even likes driving because she can see all the way around. Excellent and responsive ABS brakes.</FAVORITE>

I get well over 34 miles to the gallon. Overall I like this truck and to think I was going to buy a Cavalier </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'll be completely honest here! I have a bare bones 2007 ford Ranger no AC, no CD, no tilt, no power anything, and 5 speed. I love it! I commuted about 50-60 km a day each way so roughly 100- 120 a day km and I still only fuel up about every 5-6 days! I'm not talking babying it down the road, I'm talking about putting my foot down and opening it up.I do my regular oil changes and tire rotation and one year and about 25,000 kms later is has yet to fail me! Again I'll be honest, you want power and size in a small truck? Get a Dakota. If you want reliablity and wicked MPG definitely get a Ranger. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Far and away the manual 5 speed feature! I just love dropping gears in this little unit and blowing by people. Comfortable ride as well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Peppy 4 cylinder, suspension stiff which is OK by me, great gas mileage (avg 28, 30+ highway), drive a lot of dirt roads and no rattles after 10k. Old design, but smallness helps with gas mileage. Seats are great but I'm 5'8". Ride height good. I'll keep it until I die (am 56). I'm a Ford family.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE> AC feels like it could do my house, torquey engine, great gas mileage is an understatement, fun to drive, the 6 ft bed is OK by me, wanted a LB but nothing in region late in year. Besides, I'll just pay someone to deliver heavy stuff. That's the way we're all headed. Quiet interior. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This was my father and I's first pickup truck and overall we are pretty satisfied. It's a decent size, good off-road cap, good quality, reliable, good-looking, and fun to drive. The only thing i have a problem with is the gas mileage. During the winter i averaged about 13.7 City and 18.5 highway and during the summer about 15.7 city and 20.3 highway. This could be better. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Ranger, 1st was a '95 4.0 STX. I like the extra room in the super cab and overall styling, but not the performance. 18 mpg highway (and I drive easy) and no low end hp or torque. My '95 was 10 times better in low gear off road and got 23+mpg to boot. I don't feel the extra hp (47) from the new engine and gas mileage flat out stinks for a V6 of this size. I've got friends with big diesels that get almost the same mileage with twice the performance! As stated by Edmunds, the truck's strong point is off-road, so why give it an engine that produces it's power above 3,500 rpm?! Have had no mechanical/service issues with the truck in the first year of ownership.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smaller wheelbase is nice off-road. Can't decide if I like the torsion bar suspension yet. Definitely not lift friendly for off-road mods. 4.10 gears are a must with this engine to get any acceptable performance. Can't imagine this truck with 3.55 gearing - would it even make it off the line?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the way this truck rides and handles. It can take a beating and the 4x4 is something you need, especially in New England winters. I've gotten as high as 25.6 mpg in the summer. It's preety good on gas for a 4.0 v-6 compared to other competitors 4.0's. I reccomend this truck for some one that want a truck that can get low to moderate jobs done.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My new Ranger has been in the shop 13 times in one year - 7 times in the past 2 months-Only has 15,000 km. Problems started first month-serious clunking in the steering in mid-turn & when accelerating from stop.Inner Tie rod ends have been replaced 4 times in 2 monthsc- last ones were Ford's new/improved ones, as a result of TS Bulletins and serious problems. Also had intermediate shaft replaced twice and lower steering shaft once. Finally no clunking - only been a week - I am wary. Dealer told me several other owners have the same problem. Ford avoiding a recall? In my mid-40s, owned 28 vehicles all makes...never had such an unreliable piece of metal in the driveway (and I am a Ford fan). </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just past the "One Year of Ownership" mark, and all's well. In that time, my Ranger has yet to so much as rattle, and this despite 22K L.A. miles in a single year. As I've stated in my earlier reviews, by 2007 truck standards, my Ranger borders on "antique." Literally every other truck on the market rides more smoothly, get better gas mileage and provides greater and more cleverly packaged interior spaces. That said however, few offer Ranger's total combo of rugged styling, "just right" size and seemingly military- spec durability. For those desiring a classic, comfortable little truck, adeptly able to tackle your basic chores without busting your bank account; Ranger's still #1. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy and comfortable interior; supportive seats covered in durable "I can't believe it's not cloth" coverings; stain-proof vinyl flooring (in Sport and XL); functional dash layout (even if it does date back to 1995!); general reliablity/durability; low cost of ownership </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I needed a new vehicle for driving to work and back and decided to get a lower cost pickup so I could haul stuff if I needed to. This little truck feels bigger than it is and runs great.

<TEXT>Nearly 16,000 miles on my 07' Sport Supercab, and all's well. Even after that many (abusive L.A.) miles in only 7 months, my truck has yet to so much as rattle! Without any exaggeration, it feels as though this truck was assembled for military duty; so perfect"is the build quality. Granted it's still the most dated appliance in its genre, but certainly that 1,000 years of production history has served to iron out any bugs from the system. For anybody looking for a classic compact truck, without pretense, of just right"size and certainly impeachable build quality - Ranger warrants a solid look. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Compact size makes for easy manuevering, parking. Roomy extended cab. Tank-like build quality (there isn't so much as a screw out of place in my model!) Excellent and very functional dash layout (everything in easy reach). Modern touches (e.g. iPod/aux input) in an otherwise classic pickup. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I originally picked up this Ranger FX4 Level ll because of price. All the foreign trucks were considerally more expensive. I have a feeling this is an American website, so I hope you can relate. It is completely loaded with leather, power everything, A/C, six-disk changer, a class three trailer hitch, bed liner and something Ford calls "Wear and Tear Package". Essentialy this truck can be returned with up to $3500 damage at the end of the lease for which I can walk away from having to pay. All for $361. a month taxes in for three years. Hell, they're giving these trucks away. And this truck looks absolutely awesome </TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently brought a Ford Ranger Fx4 level 2 due to its low price and standard options on the vehicle. My experience with this truck it ain't great. After 2 weeks of driving, the wheel alignment was off, battery died have to get it boost. The truck is a gas guzzler. It doesn't provide a lot of power, throttle response is very slow. Bottom line, the truck isnt worth buying. Ford commercial looks good on TV, but where they get you is when you purchase their vechicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>3 months, 6,500 miles and all's well! Thus far my Ranger's been as regular and reliable as an atomic clock, and L.A. traffic what is; I drive the heck out of my little truck. I still couldn't imagine myself in any other vehicle - Ranger's "perfect fit" size, tossable handling, excellent ergonomics and (so far) bullet-proof quality make this truck a clear winner for me! While far from the most modern or refined choice on the market, for anyone looking for a "real" and wholly usable little pick-up that, well equipped, won't break the bank - Ranger certainly warrants a look. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy (extended) cab, still excellent fit and finish (even from a dash design dating to 1995!), smooth ride at speed, simple "basic truck" design (no foo-foo I wanna-be-a-car lines), smaller, more maneuverable size, general feeing of solidity, very-modern touches (still lovin' the iPod input jack).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am very pleased with my Ranger. It easy and fun to drive and I really like the styling. The suspension is firm but not harsh and the steering response is excellent with good feedback. The automatic transmission's shifts are smooth and precise. The I4 engine has plenty of power and has no problem keeping up with 75 mph traffic. The ABS provides excellent straight line stops. The instrumentation is laid out well and all of the controls are within easy reach. The cloth bench seat is comfortable with good support. Fit and finish on my Ranger is good. There are no rattles or squeaks and wind noise at 75 mph is low. The fuel mileage is good at 26 mpg in combined street/highway driving</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got the 2 door SuperCab XL about three months ago. The Ranger is really not that bad a truck for the price. My biggest complaint would be that something has come loose between the headliner and the trim on the right side of the truck, and it makes a buzzing sound right in my left ear. I'm gonna have the dealership take a look at this. I think the interior could use some more attention to detail, too. This truck has SEVEN different intermittent settings for the windshield wipers, but has exposed bolts holding the radio/fan control console onto the dash. Do we really need seven different wiper speeds? That aside, the truck really runs well and the gas mileage is great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4 cylinder with 5 speed manual runs great. Plenty of power for the size and fun to drive. Seats are actually pretty comfortable. The ride is fairly smooth for a truck. Good looking truck. Nothing comparable in the price range. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I need both a commuter vehicle and something I could haul things with and found the perfect vehicle to do both. This truck gives me great gas mileage while allowing me to do the numerous weekend chores that require a pickup bed. The 2.3L engine is responsive and well suited for a vehicle of this weight. The 5 speed manual tranny adds a bit of fun as well. The price was very reasonable, under $13,000 with A/C. Great value.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>2.3L DOHC engine and 5 speed manual transmission provide good power to weight ratio. Gas mileage and price are strong selling points. A solid little truck that looks good. Like buying a 32' Ford pickup, only new.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I special ordered this truck with all the options I wanted. I waited about 6 weeks for it to come in. After a few weeks I noticed light spots in the paint on the cab sides while in direct sunlight. I did not notice this before since it had been overcast. The problem was pretty bad so I let warranty handle it. Now, the metallic in the paint does not match. The dealer and Ford think this is acceptable and not noticeable but everyone else notices it without me pointing it out. Now, I have a new truck that I do not even want. The dealers response is that is the best the paint match will be. No more Fords for me. I am considering taking a hit and buying another product. I am extremely hacked off.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased 4 cylinder with automatic 07 Ranger based in part on positive reviews. Found truck to have poor build quality with little support from Ford. Makes excessive vibration from exhaust and very loud transmission whine in low gear. Dealer and Ford customer relations say this is normal for this type vehicle. Vehicle in shop 4 times within first month of ownership. Paint on tail gate and bed sides has large metallic runs. Door out of alignment. Ford fix for exhaust vibration is to install clamped on weight on exhaust pipe aft of converter. Fixed door alignment problem. I'm afraid to have paint work fixed as the color won't match. Buyers, better due your due diligence before purchase. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased my shiny new Ranger Sport Supercab this past Sunday. Traded in a Mercury Sable for what'll be my third Ranger - and hopefully not my last! Mine is well equipped with the power package, tilt/cruise, 6CD, etc. Certainly there exists, and I could have chosen, a roomier, more powerful and even more efficient truck, but few of these (if any) would have offered Ranger's combination of just-right sizing, proven safety, and long term durability. For me, for the money, and for the long haul, Ranger fits like a pair of old shoes. Trading in my second one a few years back was about the stupidest thing I ever did, and I couldn't be more elated to once again own my "dream truck." </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>"Not too big, not too small" - Ranger offers space for a guy my size (6'1") without feeling cumbersome or bloated. Rugged, almost timeless exterior styling. Smooth and hushed ride at cruise. General feeling of "heft" and solidity. Modern touches such as an input jack for my iPod. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am sure I'm one of the select few who have "traded down" from a 2006 Tacoma to a 2007 Ranger. My brief 2.7 5M SR5 Taco experience included two trips to the dealer for a bad rear end (in which the whole "pumpkin" was replaced) and two trips for a clutch/shift problem that wasn't resolved. The Tacoma is vastly over-rated. My 4x4 was bone jarring on the road, had no torque, shifted like a bucket of bolts, and got just 20-21 mpg. But so much for Yota bashing. My 2.3L XLT gets GREAT mileage (31 mph), shifts smoothly, and has enough power to get up about any hill without downshifting. Yep, the platform is dated, but it still looks good, works hard and is really worth what you pay. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Ok i admit it I love big trucks. In fact I almost bought a Sierra work truck for $11,900 this summer but couldn't get past the 17 mpg I'd be getting. So I went to the Ford Dealer and looked at the Rangers. I bought an XLT long bed 4 cylinder 5 speed model and it's been great. Great on gas, great on performance and great on usefulness. The 2.3 liter motor is torqued down well and the size of the bed for a compact truck is great. A real 7 foot long bed tops Toyota and Chevy. The exterior of the Ranger is a timeless well executed design. It is a truck so you do feel bumps, however tooling around town getting 28 mpg is fine with me. The inside is nothing new but there has been some updates.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seats are great. 28 mph with usable 7 foot bed. This truck saves you $1,000 a year in gas over the full sized trucks. If you don't need the payload or towing capacity why drive around with all the excess all the time. Good price and great resale.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this truck to haul motorcycles and go camping in the deep woods. This truck is a little monster and is capable of outperforming some of the larger full-size pickups when it comes to off-roading due to its smaller size and lighter weight. The larger wheels, Torsen rear-end, 4 wheel drive, and Bilstein shocks make this truck fun to drive. It performs well in the city as well. It can get between 250 and 400 miles on city or highway roads. It drives really smooth on the highway. The interior and exterior styling is excellent and I would recommend getting the Pioneer sound system as the stock radio and speakers are a little weak. Overall, an excellent truck for the adventurer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Shift on the fly 4 wheel drive, Torsen differential, interior safety features, 6 disk cd-changer, 31" BF Goodrich AT's, Bilstein gas shocks, 3 skid plates for protection. Exterior styling. Rugged look.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just bought this vehicle and I must say it is much more stylish than some of the previous years...love the new front. The inside is a little narrow widthwise. Headroom is just okay. Plenty of leg room. Wish seats in the extended cab were standard. Very cute little truck...hope it lasts a good while. Ford does offer an undercoating for rust protection for $299 but I elected not to get it. I would recommend this truck over Chevy, Dodge, GMC, etc. It is not a bad value for the price. The dark gray looks very sporty.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty look of exterior. Standard XLT wheels are very nice. Wheels are bigger than the Dodge Ram 1500 just traded. </FAVORITE>
