<TEXT>By the title you've surmised it's blue in color. Buying at carmax you don't get a color choice. But color aside our 07 Vera is one great ride more standard features than any vehicle I've ever owned. We have a big family 2 kids who are going to be monsters and 2 dogs who are monsters. My only concern is the light Grey interior not good for boys, very supportive seats, good lumbar support, great exterior views, no blind spots, headlights a different story projector lowbeams have a sharp cutoff of light very good. The highbeams shine into lowflying aircraft. Adjustment I'll have to call on NASA for that. Screrws, gears, plastic not enough time. Or patience well about run out of characters.........</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>TPS, great stereo system, seats supportive, great visibility, privacy glass no charge for third seat. Spare tire not a favorite. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased out Veracruz Limited in August 2007 and have since driven it for 12000 miles. To date not one screwdriver has touched it. Nothing has been tightened, nothing has been repaired, and nothing has been replaced in the two years of driving. It is the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned in my 65 years of driving experience. I heartily recommend this vehicle to any one that places a high value on reliability. Its excellent design, construction, a 5 year bumper-to-bumper warranty, and 10 year warranty on the drive train makes this vehicle hard to beat in the automotive world. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is really nice to drive. My husband who is 6'4" fits comfortably in the middle row, my 3 kids also fit very well, with room to spare(including a car seat). We have really enjoyed taking this car on trips. It has a lot of get up and go power, it rides smooth like a luxury sedan. We have been so happy with this purchase, we will more than likely purchase an upgrade in a few more years. I definitely recommend this SUV!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After considering the Rav4 and the Santa Fe, and neither fitting within my budget ($23k out the door). I looked into used Highlanders and the Veracruzes. Found some 2007's with all the perks (premium packages - leather, etc.), everything but the DVD player or navigation systems. This Veracruz is the most comfortable car ever! Soft on the road, and powerful when needed. Gas mileage is not the best (15city/22highway), but acceptable. The seats are super comfortable, the interior space is great! Even the 3rd row is not bad and I've sat back there (I'm 6'0). Everyone who's ridden in it loves it, and I think I'm a future Hyundai owner for life! Price was sweet at $22,300 (walkout) w/29k miles.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>High off the ground, large sideview mirrors, comfortable seats, nice interior blue dash lighting, soft ride, powerful, quiet!, and the rear sensors for backing up are AWESOME!, sideview mirror signals, sunroof.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We went shopping for an SUV 2 years ago. Test drove Toyota, VW and third in line was this babe. Both myself and my wife were so baffled with the quality of the vehicle, we decided to buy it immediately. sort of "love at first drive". Gives us about 19 in city driving and has given as much as 27 on highway. 2 years and we still love this babe. Engine revs freely (responds well with Shell gasoline) and is surprisingly quick off the line. Quality of materials inside the vehicle is awesome.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchase my car in June 07, going down from a Sequoia. The Veracuse reminded me of a Lexus, but a Lexus it ain't. The seats in this car have never been as comfortable as my old Sequoia and I find the velor type material difficult to clean. The all wheel drive has been very reliable on my mountainous road, but the mileage is not good and that was the reason I traded my Sequoia in. With that model I was getting 17.8 mpg and with this vehicle it's the same or 18 mpg, what a disappointment. Now that I have 55,000 miles on the vehicle the right ball bearing has gone and the latch on the center console broke. I think Hyundai is working on improvement, but I am ready to try something else</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hello, I just wanted to share with you folks my experience with my Vera-cruz limited. I now have had it over two years now and had one minor recall on it to install a better fuel filter. The car is so beautiful, I never get tired of looking at it and I have a two wheel drive and I get 24 miles per gallon, and I am amazed at the Lexus quality it has and this is my 7th Hyundai, and I will be getting the new 2009 Vera cruz with the same color and equipment as I just love this car as it has a lot of class and I can only say to you folks that buy a Hyundai and you won't regret it.. The car has the ultimate package on it and I love the 605 Watt radio and ten speakers and the dvd, wow what a car we love it</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>605 Watt radio, adjustable petals, strong engine but should have the gegesis 3.8 290 horse engine in it, super comfortable ride, high quality inside and out, beautiful styling, and great warranty, and no problems after 2years and love the Michelin tires, and the black diamond paint, and is very quiet ride </FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Disappointed</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle in the FWD Model and not the AWD version. It is horrible in the snow, I had other FWD's and they blew this vehicle away. It gets stuck with just a dusting of snow. It also hydroplanes on the Interstate with just a little rain. The divers side window would not go up and had to go abck to dealership to correct the problem. The brake rotors had to be ground down to get rid of the shimming when the brakes were applied. I am very disappointed at the 29,000 dollar vehicle. i am getting rid of it to get something I can feel safe driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The only nice feature with the vehicle is the style although, there is a very bad blind spot on the rear quarters that almost got my family killed. The lights are bright and this is also a hazard, since everyone hits you with theirs, even though you do not have yours on. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Read the warranty close;you'll need it. Stranded twice for massive power loss on highway. 3 times to the dealer for elec. glitches like alarm system malfunction. Warranty only allows for two roadside rescues per 12 month period; we needed more. Amazingly, if their vehicle breaks down more than twice in any one 12 month period, you have to pick up the towing fees to get them to fix something that's under warranty! You have work hard to get over 20mph in this car. Around town in gets 17 or so if you keep your foot out of it. If you drive like it's a 4 cylinder, you can get 22 on the highway (with a tailwind). If we could rewind the clock we wouldn't buy this car. Pay the extra $ for a Toyota.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Road noise is very high in this car, which I enjoy since it makes the premium stereo hard to hear.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I purchased 07 Veracruz AWD Limited Natural Khaki on mothers day May 07. We know have 25,000 miles on it, and it has been the best car we have ever owned. Our friends always ask "is that a Lexus?" The car is great on highway and in the snow, the only problem we have had was the TPMS light staying on, it was a module that needed replacing, no other issues.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the LTD instead of the SE because my wife wanted the power liftgate. The ride is the smoothest I've ever had and my passengers do not fail to notice this. The steering is not sporty but luxurious. To avoid high RPM I come off the stop light at 3500 rpm and at the first shift I increase the pressure on the accelerator and it holds it's own but the power is there if you don't mind reving to 4000. The automatic A/C and dimming mirrows are special and the controls on the wheel along with the power liftgate says LTD. but here' the topper: We pulled up to a family picnic and my wife said that it felt so good that she didn't feel like getting out. After 32 years, I finally did something R</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased a Veracruz Limited AWD on Mothers Day in Sacramento. The ride is very nice overall, some jolting over potholes. Very secure feeling, and great look over the road. Great overall size, not as cramped as Santa Fe, but not as sporty as Santa Fe.Difficult decision deciding on VC or SF, both have great features. The front end is not my favorite feature, so I purchased a mask, looks great.I also purchased the gold package on emblems, looks great on Natural Khaki color.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The minute I saw this CUV I knew I would have to own one. I bought the GLS because my husband has a santa fe limited and I dont use half the things in his car. I love it, its drive is so smooth and its pretty much soundproof. My daughter just turned 16 and with all the airbags and safety features I dont feel like im going to die when she is driving it. I never thought that Hyundai would make such a beautiful vehicle with so much space, the third row is great for toting around my daughters friends and the gas MPG is amazing for a car of this size. I would reccamend this car to anyone. People always ask me about it and want to take a look at it, and im always happy to show them.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>This is a Hyundai???</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>We bought this after searching every maker for a 7-passenger SUV that was fun to drive, looked good, felt good, and got more than 15-17 MPG. It's not an ugly minivan/round box SUV clone, it didn't cost $50K+ like the luxury brands, and it gets 20+ MPG combined driving while taking regular gas (unlike virtually every other premium- swilling luxury SUV - that's worth another 1-2 miles per gallon if you do the math). 1000 miles in, I am amazed! It is so far an awesome vehicle and comes in cheaper than the 5-passenger Lexus RX (whose look it very conveniently resembles) - plus it outperformed the Lexus in a Washington Post auto review. Good fit and finish, great warranty. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very comfortable seats (leather). XM radio (I just left the Dark Ages). Bewildered stares at traffic signals. 3rd seat folds down flat for excellent cargo space. The warranty. Nice smooth ride and decent acceleration.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my new Veracruz for a few weeks now. So far, love it! Very intuitive controls. Super quiet. The handling is more luxury, less sport, but it has great pick up when you need it. The second row bench is very comfortable - my kids like it better than the Dodge Durango, the Nissan Maxima, and the Infiniti G35. The seat material feels like a super soft suede, very nice. 100x better than the Pilot. I cannot imagine getting a comparable vehicle for anywhere near the price (under $30k). </TEXT>

<TEXT>We just picked up a Veracruz the other day and what a beautiful vehicle. During the first test drive I was shocked at the smooth ride and quality, very impressed with what they have done in the crossover segment. Considered a minivan but this drove so much nicer. When the truck is running you can't even tell, no noise or vibration whatsoever. This is the base model and it has everything you will need and then some. AWD, 3rd row seats, 18/25 mpg, 5 star safety rating, rear heat and a/c, fabulous exterior and interior design, XM radio and more! Even has puddle lights. If you are in the market for a crossover you have to check this vehicle out b/c you will be amazed at what it has to offer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Blows Pilot out of the water. Purchased fully loaded SE. Logic 7 audio is easily on par with Bose. Mistaken for Lexus RX by friends especially after riding in it. Dead silent inside, 2nd row very comfortable, and 3rd row not bad either. Gas mileage not too shabby, transmission shifts like a dream, good call on the Aisin 6-speed. Great value for the money. Navigation not an option, but I am in the opinion that if you don't know where you are going, you should not be driving. If you must, a portable navigation system is cheaper and makes more sense. Drive it for yourself if you are shopping in this class. You are shortchanging yourself if you don't. Don't let the badge fool you.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My husband and I just bought the 2007 Hyundai Veracuz yestterday from Somerworth Hyundai. Despike the fact that there is no incentive for this new model from Hyundai, we are able to get an excellent deal from this car dealer shop. Highly recommended to other protential hyundai buyer in New England areas. In terms of the performance and functions of this car, it does drives like a mini van without the "grand father looked of the car". The gas mileages is better then other mid-size SUV with AWD. Based on the mileage rating sheet of the Veracuz (3.6L) has better mileage than our 2003 model Hyundai Santa Fe with 4WD with 1.8L. This is a great buy for the money for different look. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have had our 2007 Vera-cruz for a year and a half and it has been as usual a very good experience and other than a fuel filter upgrade recall the car is flawless and we are so proud of this beautiful black-diamond beauty and every time I drive it I am excited and feel like I am a Young kid again. The car is so smooth and the select shift is great and when we went to Florida I got 25 mpg and drove from Atlanta to cincy on a tank of fuel, and that is 500 miles, so if you people who complain about bad gas mileage, if you drive sensible you too will get this mileage. Love the high quality finish and the gorgeous inside and out and in my opinion it is the most beautiful suv on the market. Thanks</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought mine in July 07'. I bought the lowest model because I had some doubts about the maker. But I'm very very pleased with this car with 15000 on odo. No problemo. Doing about 19.5mpg mostly in the city. The only regret is that I..We (actually my wifes' car) didn't buy higher model. We should have bought at least the SE. We test drove all and yes, ALL suv and cuv in the similar class and it came down to VC and Highlander. Highlander was a nice suv also but we have no regrets whatsoever about choosing VC. Those who are in the market, I highly recommend VCruz. Test drive and see for yourselves. I can't wait to trade for higher model. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After being high pressured by the dealership, we finally signed on the line. Now with 13000 miles, we are beginning to wonder if we made a mistake. at 10,000 miles we had to return to the dealership, because my wife (primary driver) got stranded. At first they said it was the transmission, next they said it was the throttle body. After a week in the shop we got it back, and every time we slowed down for a red light, the transmission would jump and slip, then the drivers seat quit working. We have never gotten better than 22 mpg on a 500 mile trip, and around 1+ in town!I am not a happy camper at all!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got a year-end closeout deal on the 2007 Veracruz Limited. From the first few days I had sporadic issues with keyless entry not working, memory set seat and steering wheel position not resetting or sometimes not responding at all. Radio presets often jump back to 1st preset-no matter where in the 6 station order you are, power windows and ignition refused to move on 2 occasions. The kicker is the feeling that the power-train slips and one time refused to engage after I came to a stop at a red light. Everything begins working once I restart the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Hello every one, just wanted to share my fellow Hyundai Veracruz 2007. I now have 10,000 miles on my car and it continues to impress after one and a half years of ownership. My Veracruz is black diamond and saddle interior, and it still is drop dead beautiful, and as I approach the car I just thank god that I have such a beautiful car and drove it to my college at Florida state and got 26 miles per gallon with the air on driving 65 mph, so continue to be very impressed with the Veracruz and I highly recommended to Hyundai that they at least offer the v8 engine, and offer the full 375 hp engine and not de-tune it like its brother the new borrego with only 337 hp, or offer the 290 hp 3.8 engine</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>600 wat radio,dvd,ultimate package,sport shifter,if driven properly you will get at least 24mpg,and i get 26 with two wheel drive.love the genesis,but if Hyundai would offer the v8 engine from the genesis with the full 375 hp,or the 3.8 with the 290 hp from the genesis,i really love this car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my Veracruz for about six months now. It was my plan to a buy a Toyota, as I have owned two and knowing the quality of the car. This car is the equal to the Toyota and a bit better because of the warranty. Buy this car, you will not be disappointed, and rest assured with the warranty. This car averages about twenty miles to the gallon. I am satisfied as this car is a mid-size and carries up too eight people. Again buy a Hyundai save the difference in cost and has a better warranty. So far my car is perfect.</TEXT>

My first incident happened at approx 1,000 miles when my fuel pump failed to get enough pressure and my car almost left me stranded in the middle of the desert. I had to take it back right away to get fixed again. At 7500 miles, I had to have my fuel pump replaced once again because the car kept seriously lagging on hills and sometimes would not start or start rough. Now the ESC off light comes on, wouldn't go in reverse for 20 mins, and once again lags on hills. Interior is nice though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This SUV was on my list when I bought it, but the $5200 off list convinced me. But within a week of driving, I found it was not meant for someone over six feet tall (I'm 6-2). It's smaller brethren, the Santa Fe and Tucson, have significantly more leg room. I can not drive this for any length of time at all, and am looking to replace it with something more driver friendly. A good vehicle otherwise, but what the hey . . . .</TEXT>

<TEXT>I checked several vehicles in this category and the limited Veracruz was the best for the money. Looks good,rides smooth is comfortable for my larger family. I was a bit disappointed in the dealer service when the oil cap was left off and in Phoenix. They made me drive to another dealer since they wouldn't give me a oil cap. Have called the orignial dealer for an oil change, (said it was free) and have had no call responses. I hope the durability of the car is better than the dealer service so far. Highway miles are so far averaging 22-23 and not close to the 26 advertised. I am not pleased by the drop I see in the resale value to date. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased the 2007 Veracruz and actually loved it for a while. After 10,000 miles, the transmission starts to have some serious problems. When traveling at 45-50 mph, the transmission automatically drops into a low gear, where it becomes noisy and starts rumbling and vibrating. We took the vehicle in for service on 4 occasions. The service dept would not even admit a problem until a corporate technician verified it. Even then, they said that there was nothing they could do to fix it. The reviews comparing it to a Lexus might apply when brand new, but not with 10k miles on it. We tested 3 other Veracruz models at the dealer, but the same problem was present in each (to different degrees).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently had a head-on accident in my Veracruz (airbags did NOT deploy), with $13,000 worth of damage and I am getting absolutely no help from Hyundai National Consumer Affairs. In fact, they sent me a letter regarding my vehicle and the accident and stated the wrong vehicle in the letter - they mentioned I owned an Elantra. I will be getting rid of my Veracruz and never purchasing a Hyundai again. Customer service says a lot for a company.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my Veracruz less than six months. Before buying this car I researched a number of cars. My plan all along was to buy a toyota. With my comparsion of cars I tried to throw the Veracruz out of the group.After driving the Veracruz it was a done deal.The one and best feature of the Hyundai is the warranty. No one tops this and it speaks for the car. Remember when the Toyota came into our market we were not sure it was as good the U.S. made cars. Hyundai is now in that space. I am here to tell you after owning two toyotas the Hyundai is its equal and one step better with the warranty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This winter in the Chicago area gave us our fair share of snow, and when I bought this vehicle I would never have thought this - but there were times when the snow was heavy that I took the VC instead of my Suburban! The topper is - the VC is only front wheel drive va. the four wheel on the Sub. When I bought this car I was worried about how my clients would view it when we went to golf or dinner. Most thought it was a Lexus and everyone not only loves it, but thinks I made the smarter choice when comparing the two. One client with the Acura CUV decided on the VC as his next car and another with a Lexus - traded his in for the VC as well. Love it! Smart car, great feaures.</TEXT>

<TEXT>With 826 miles on the vehicle I was coming up to a stop sign, heard a pop in the steering column and lost all steering on the vehicle. You could spin the steering wheel completely around. Coasted to a stop, had it towed to the nearest Hyundai dealer. They found it was an assembly line defect in putting the steering column together. They were very sorry it happened, but insured me they had never seen this before. They acted like my radio knob had fallen off. If I had been going down the highway at 60 mph I wouldn't be writing this now. If you have a Veracruz I would recommend you have your steering column checked. If it happened once it can happen again!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Guides show driving position leg room of 41.5 inches but it is nowhere near that. Actually found that it is 39 inches - 2 1/2' less than the smaller Santa Fe and Tucson. Painful driving position for anyone six foot or more. Driving seat back intrudes into driver's back and constantly feels like a rod across the back. After less than two months, am looking to dump it for something more comfortable. Ride is very rough over road joints or any potholes, minor or otherwise. Feels like a rattletrap over normal roads. Otherwise, a great SUV. </TEXT>

I dont think I could buy more car elsewhere.3rd row is very usable and everything is laid out conveniently. Turn radius is better than all others I tested. No cheap plastic here.

<TEXT>In early 2007, I reviewed many mid- sized SUV's to replace my leased 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I was interested in the Dodge Nitro, but Chrysler wasn't interested in giving me an attractive lease. Same for the Jeep Patriot, no dealing with these folks. So I went Toyota and test drove a Highlander .. nice but boring. Tried a Honda CR-V.. the seats were so unconfy a test drive wasn't necessary. Went to Hyundai and test drove a SantaFe nice but the Veracruz was a no brainer!! I leased the GLS with the optional moonroof and heated seats. Four months later I was T-boned in the passenger rear quarter (not my bad). The ESC system worked great to stabilize the fish-tail and help me stop safely. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride is the quietest and smoothest I have ever experienced. The base sound system is awesome especially with the XM package. The blue interior dash lights are very cool.

Wanted to leave behind the "Minivan feel, look, and life- style", but still needed plenty of room for cargo of the human and Home Depot sort. Love the look of this vehile (mistake it for the Lexus), very comfortable interior, including fold-away back seat. We also got an excellent offer for the one we bought, a combination of 1) Dealer incentives 2) Manufacturer/finance com incentives 3) Willing to take last year's model for a few buck off.

I knew I was going to take a beating but did not know had badly. Short version, no dealer in the Eastern Carolnia area would give me more that 25k, the car had a sticker price of 35K, that is 11K dollars in three months. Went to Stevenson where I bought the car, 23K was the best he would offer. I asked him if he thought 12K $ in 3 months was right and he said, yep, that's about right.

Comparing it to other Crossovers/SUV's and I think the fuel milage is damn GOOD- I can average about 22mpg in mixed driving, my previous Jeep liberty never got over 19-20(98%in 2WD)...and this is a beauty over the crappy Liberty and about 20% larger with AWD.

The styling and features are comparable or better than any of the competitors irregardless of price. The deal closer is the value ? this is a great car for just over $26K. I chose the base model GLS. I didn?t care for leather combinations in the Limited and really didn?t want the other add-ons. The dealer had a leather package from Katzkin that I had installed through the dealer. It matches the interior perfectly and is installed on all three sets of seats and the side panels. I am getting between 18 to 21 MPG in mixed driving. I would highly recommend the Veracruz.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought VC LTD FWD last week. I was considering RX350 or MDX. However, I was able to get the same kind of car for much less price. The only different is there is no "L" logo on the hood. It has "H" instead. The one that I got came with Ultimate option package with price tag $36.5K. It was hefty considering it is Hyundai. However, with my trade in, I got it for $30K and I was extremely pleased with it. This car has not been advertized much. Once PR reaches the public, the popularity will go up.

<TEXT>My wife was interested in the Santa Fe a couple of years back when she purchased a very new chevolet equinox which we were pleased. Driving the new Vericruz was an awesome experience. Of course the price was considerably more, but it was much less the the Lexus Suv of comparable design. Great ride, better drive with 7 passenger accommodation and still short wheelbase. All the bells and whistles of an expensive SUV. The power tailgate was an important feature for us. Only negatives primarly relate to accessories not yet available. Dash has good controls but console does not provide uncovered storage area. ENJOY!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was anticipating the arrival of the Veracruz as I was looking to trade-in my mini-van. I had it narrowed down to the VC and CX-9 (GMs were just too big). Seeing the Limited made-up my mind. After 2000 miles am getting 18 mpg (all city) which is slightly better than my Caravan was getting. Driving it is a dream. Easily fits 6 when we need it too (not often). Although it doesn't have bluetooth or a NAV system, which I didn't really care about, a good portable aftermarket system that does both (iPOD compatibility too) can be added for $300-500. It's quiet, comfortable and easy to maneuver around. It's my first Hyundai and I would recommend it to anyone looking in this class.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have no real complaints about this car. Came down to the CX9 or the Veracruz. the VC won out price, warranty and dealer experience. It looks great, rides nice too. Perhaps a bit stiff, but its an SUV afterall. Lots of storage, very good fit and finish, leather nice quality too. About a 1000 miles so far, and not a lick of problems.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my Veracruz on the first day of august and so far, my experience with this so called "LUV" (Luxury Utility Vehicle) has been phenominal. The powertrain has plenty of power on the go, the cabin stays quiet all the time and the fit and finish is I dare say comparable to Lexus and MB. The seats are very comfy, and my children and wife get plenty of room in the rear. So far, I'm only concerned about the front headrest. My son starts complaining about his sore neck after about an hour drive. So far, this vehicle has been great. I'm planning to go on a 500 mile trip to chicago this weekend. I'll write another review on fuel economy and dependabily of Hyundais that my wife still doubts.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The dash looks sleek and luxurious, cabin materials, fit and finish, sound system, comfy seats (I find it really comfy myself), wide cabin, sexy looking exterior, elegant looking interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We just purchased a fully loaded Veracruz Limited AWD with convenience package and more. It was the most expensive car the Hyundai dealer had ever sold. It rides well and is very comfortable. My critique is that it is skimpy on the cupholders, lacks automatic adjustable rear seats, needs more storage nooks, the engine is noisy, and it lacks bluetooth. But it is a very attractive car, without too much fake wood, and a good value if you aren't looking for snob appeal. And who can beat the warranty? I am glad there is no navi system since we have a Garmin. It's a deal compared to the luxury brand crossovers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>So far (only 1000 miles on my VC) and I'm extremely pleased. The ride is great. The a/c cools quickly. The sound system is great. The seats are very comfortble. We purchased a limited w/ ultimate package and one of my favorite features is the adjustable pedals/steering column. Seating for 7 is comfortable no matter which seat you are in. Exterior is very nice. Definitely a classy looking vehicle. So far mpg has averaged 19.9, I hope this will improve a little after the break in time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Needed a replacement for an Expedition eating me alive in fuel bills. Veracruz fit the bill. Build quality is extremely good (near Luxus) and it rides well. Some say the ride is too soft but in a vehicle like this it's a good thing. I have driven it for 2100 miles (in 3 wks) & it runs great. Long 6 hr drives cause little fatigue. It delivers 22.5 mpg on highway and around 17.5 local driving. Handling is good (but no sport car) and the engine is responsive. The best part of the drive train is the 6 spd trans. Its smooth as silk. No joke, as in the TV commercial, my friend entered a nearby Lexus RX 350 thinking it my car. That said, the $31k I paid was money well spent. I am happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far this is a great suv. I have 3 kids(1,3, and 8) so the third row was absolutely necessary and does the job quite well. I am replacing a dodge durango with this one so I am used to plenty of space and the veeracruz delivers. Access to the third row is very easy and folding it up and down is a lot easier than the durango. The fact that the veracruz is built on the same frame as their minivan makes the ride VERY smooth. The handling is also very good compared to some of the suvs in its class. Before going ahead with this choice we also test drove the Outlook, Acadia and Pilot and by far the veracruz is the best bang for the buck. I am recommending it to everyone looking for an suv.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I bought a new Veracruz 6 weeks ago. Our main reason for purchasing the Veracruz is its safety features. Our main concern is that this vehicle has now been back to the dealership twice with electrical problems. On both occasions the vehicle would not start - the dealership seems to think it is just the battery (despite the battery checking out OK). The electrical equipment is also behaving very oddly. Clearly there is a major electrical problem with this vehicle which makes us concerned about the many electrical and safety features on this vehicle. Our advice - wait before buying this vehicle. We either have a lemon or Hyundai has a major electrical issue to resolve.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the GLS with the premium package (sunroof, power/heated seat) and have a very well appointed-luxury in my view, 7-seater crossover SUV for under $27k (we paid $200 over invoice) with a 10 year warranty. Incredible. This vehicle is rock solid, beautiful inside and out, and extremely quiet. We made a 300 mile trip with 4 + baby and all were quite comfortable (baby slept the whole way) and we had cavernous room for luggage/baby stuff. Flip the 3rd row and you still have room for the baby stuff. I cannot recommend this car more highly -get over the Hyundai "stigma" as it is wholly unjustified. Car of the Year right here... </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm the previous owner of (2)Santa Fe's (2001 & 2006). Fell in love with the Veracruz when I went car shopping with a friend. I love the Hyundai warranty (10 year, 10,000 miles) and the car is unbelievably comfortable, stylish and great performance. So glad that Hyundai finally has a luxury vehicle and believe me this crossover is really luxurious! I have people stop me all the time to ask about the vehicle. I've never had that happen before. It is a pleasure to drive, a nice smooth drive and much quieter interior than my Santa Fe. It really is outstanding. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had originally planned to buy a Honda Pilot, but the Hyundai dealership is located next to the Honda Dealership and thought I'd take a look at the Veracruz. After the testdrive, I was sold. I got a good price (2% over invoice). My friends all love the car. Seven of us (all adult males) went to a ballgame and everyone felt comfortable (I was a little worried about the guy in the middle seat of the 2nd row). So far, I'm getting 23.1 mpg (with an average speed of 27 mph), much better than I expected. I teach at a college and have had several students approach me and tell me how hot the car looks. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's soooo quiet, seats are very comfortable. The dealer offered a maintenace package that I thought was a great bargain (all sschedule maintenance for 5 years for $800..more than half off normal). A colleague at work said he couldn't believe I could afford a Lexus on our salary. :-) </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the turn-around vehicle for Hyundai. Beautiful styling, features, comfort, quiet, refined ride and handling. Much nicer interior than the MDX or CX-9. Love that it takes regular fuel. The Ultimate package was worth every penny. The sound is fantastic and the stereo controls intuitive and very easy to use. Cannot say enough about this CUV! I am no longer a loyalist to the Japanese manufacturers...A Winner!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased a Veracruz for my wife's birthday. I'm a Honda guy so buying a Hyundai was a "leap of faith". Also considered a Pilot. Despite the $5K savings for purchasing a Pilot, the VC is simply a better, more refined vehicle for my needs. Build quality is outstanding. Quality of materials is first rate. The VC does everything well. Everyone thinking about a CUV should give this vehicle a chance. Throw out any pre-conceived notions about the brand and enjoy the Veracruz. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned a '99 Lexus RX300 since it was new. When we were recently faced w/my husband losing his company car, we assumed we'd get the RX350 because we've been so pleased w/our first Lexus. Well, in our opinion, our new Hyundai Veracruz has blown the Lexus RX out of the water! The smooth, quiet ride, the very many luxury features and the gorgeous body style can't compete with the Lexus, or it's over-blown price tag. We have 2 months before we give up the company car - the Lexus has been collecting dust in the garage while we take our awesome Veracruz everywhere! I never thought I'd be a Hyundai owner, but I couldn't be happier with it. You MUST consider Veracruz if buying a crossover!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the styling and the interior is fabulous. So far, I'm averaging about 19.6 MPG in all around driving and it is not even broken in yet. I test drove everything in its class, but something kept bringing back to the Veracruz. I pull a 3500 pound boat, and it pulls it much better than my 4.0L, V-6 Explorer did. The engine and transmission are both smooth and refined. Sometimes I can't tell if the engine is even running. I owned two Hondas prior to this, but I could not purchase the Pilot over the Veracruz. The Honda dealer's arrogance just pushed me right into the Hyundai dealer's showroom. Time will tell, but I'm very pleased with this vehicle, and highly recommend it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The silky engine and transmission combination! The Shiftronic Transmission makes it sporty and helps when I'm pulling my boat. The stereo set up is awesome! My dealer offered a 20 Year/200,000 Mile Powertrain Warranty. How do you top that! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Compared to Honda Pilot, Mazda CX9, GMC Acadia and a couple of others. Hands down this is the best overall value. Limited package makes this ride similar to the Lexus RX. My brother in law has one - very nice car... but pushing $50,000? That's crazy. This one is so close to it in power, looks, toys, and build quality that it's a no brainer. Just found out that Motor Trend confirmed what I think! (See July, 2007 - Comparo Shock! Hyundai BEATS Lexus) Only had it a week, but wow. This crossover is the perfect soccer mom car (and I get to drive it on the weekend family trips - it's a cool rig). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Limited Package (the value in this is unreal); near perfect balance of power and fuel economy; power lift gate - not really a necessity... but it's cool; chiller box - good for bottled water; styling - chickish, but not overly so; quietness - wow, is this a Hyundai?</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I test drove nearly every vehicle in this class and the Veracruz wasn't even on the list until recommended by a friend. It soon became the benchmark for all others in its class. OUTSTANDING interior room, TONS of bells and whistles and safety features STANDARD (on the Limited with the Ultimate package). Peppy engine with a smooth transmission and extremely comfortable ride (on Michelin tires, no less) make this the perfect family vehicle. And, for $34K (for the FWD Limited LOADED) that included the warranty upgrade to 10-year BUMPER-TO- BUMPER coverage...aside from normal maintenance, this vehicle is stress- free to own. Thanks, Hyundai, for building such a classy vehicle.</TEXT>

Cool box in the center consel, 110 outlet, LOTS of seat and shoulder room, awsome stereo, cool blue-lights in the interior, tons of safety features, memory buttons that remember EVERYTHING, "Intelikey" system, Conversation mirror, powerful engine, smooth ride...and on and on.</FAVORITE>
