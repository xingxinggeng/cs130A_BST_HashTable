<TEXT>We got the A3 because it was fun to drive and was a luxury wagon. Last week my husband was stopped in traffic on the highway and was rear ended by a Dodge Caravan going 50-60 MPH. The A3 is a total loss with over 19,000 in visual damage alone. The safety features in this car can't be beat, while my husband has some injuries he was able to walk away from a serious multi-vehicle accident.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this A3 with 7000 miles and it displayed very little wear. After driving it for a month in icy and snowy conditions I am very impressed. The stock all season tires get the job done but the fronts are worn a good bit. There are no rattles and the s-tronic transmission works very well. Handling is excellent and the mileage is decent considering the power and weight, about 20mpg in mixed winter driving. The A3 tends to be very touchy when accelerating from a stop, it's jerky and hard to achieve a smooth getaway. The brakes are excellent. Overall, I'm very pleased with the interior quality and look of the A3. I drove the 2.0 turbo and I feel the V6 is considerably better.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, handling, rear space for hauling, seat comfort, exterior design and overall looks. Very fun to use the paddle shifting and S transmission mode. A3 sounds great under hard acceleration and yet is quiet when cruising. Great stereo.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have an A4, love it, decided to get an A3. Worse mileage than our truck, turns 3000 RPMs at highway speed, can't even make 10MPH in 1st gear. TERRIBLE design point. We've contacted Audi, they blame everyone else (dealer, etc) - but it is the worst design I have seen in 30 years of buying cars. Lighter than the A4, same power (V6), smaller, and about 10MPG worse than the A4 - blows my mind. We won't touch Audi again - due to Audi USA refusing to discuss, acknowledge, suggest fixes (ie, different gear ratio in the differentials). By the way, I'm an engineer, have extensive auto experience...</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the premium package with the white exterior and dark grey interior. This is a good looking car, BUT I have had so many problems with it. Exteriorly, the trim on the sky system keeps on popping off. I had to bring my vehicle in 4 times to get this fixed. The Pirelli tires that come stock are terrible! I had to replace the fronts under 20000 and the rear 25000. Now I am having engine problems with the transmission. Recommendation: don't purchase this vehicle! Also very noisy while driving past 60 mph especially if you get the roof racks, which are also junk. Mine broke the first week I got them. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The car seems pricey for an A3 sized chassis, but the car seats everyone comfortably. The hatchback also can fit a lot. I bought a big grill at Home Depot and the sales associate looked at me like I was crazy for thinking the grill in its box would fit in my car. It did. Hatchback closed. The car accelerates and handles great. I do seem to go through tires a bit, and I've been told that by mechanics that the A3 does seem to chew up the front three tires faster than normal.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It has been very reliable. There are none of the squeaks or rattles identified in other reviews. It brakes confidently. Steering is wonderful and acceleration makes it plenty quick without being stupid fast. What the reviews don't tell you is that this is the ultimate city car. Compact, practical, quick and stylish. Yet it will pour itself done a twisty back road with verve. It's only weakness is touring on US freeways. For that you need something heavier with a longer wheel base. But since 90% of my driving is in the city, I couldn't be happier with my choice. Beware of the clutch take up on the DSG transmission. It is set agressively. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DSG tranny is great for urban driving. More fun than a traditional automatic, less work than a clutch. Handy hill hold feature. Sky roof gives a cool vibe and lots of fresh air. Love it. Great motor, steering, brakes. You know, the stuff that counts. Impeccable Audi style inside and out.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great, versatile car. It offers a fun to drive, economical vehicle that can also hull a large amount of equipment, especially with the rear seats folded down. I don't think any other car on the market has all of this. I purchased the S-line with just about every option available. I can't imagine living without rain sensing wipers now. Which leads to my dilemma. I will have to replace this car before the warranty runs out. I have had three major issues with the vehicle with a total down time of well over a month, and this within the first year of ownership. I hate to say it, but I cannot recommend this car based on its poor reliability.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. I have approximately 6000 miles on it. I like the feel of the car - very nicely done - and the pick up, but the engine noise is a bit loud. The manual says to shift earlier - right. I am a bit disappointed about having to choose between the Ipod plug or Sirius. For this kind of money you would think they could figure out how to include both options together. I really love the sun roof and moon roof. The drive is smooth and the seats are comfortable. I drove everything from the Fit to the A3 and by far this was the best car if you are looking for a hatchback. The only problem I have had was a bad sensor in the fuel tank set off the engine light, but it was fixed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my A3 because I wanted a vehicle with smaller dimensions than my '98 Passat, but I wanted many of the qualities I enjoyed in the VW that I didn't find in Japanese or American vehicles. The dimensions for parking in crowded Seattle is a blessing. The acceleration performance is wonderful, and handling is very good but not great. The practicality is what I wanted. I finally was convinced that it made sense to now own an auto trans mainly because of the excellent 6-spd. twin clutch auto. I realize I could have purchased a VW Rabbit/Golf GTI with many of the same qualities and features for far less, but I wanted the more premium features of the Audi, and I prefer its exterior design.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The A3 is delightfully deceptive, looking small on the outside but airy and roomy inside and appearing underpowered by a 2 liter engine but providing more get up and go than many larger engines. In addition, it's beautifully assembled and it handles like a true sport. Fuel efficiency is good, averaging 29 mpg. The iPod interface works well, the sound system is super, the steering responsive and sure, and the wipers clear without clatter or skipping. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had my A3 for over a month and absolutley love it. The only option I wanted and got is the Open Sky System, which has worked pretty much flawlessly. I've been averaging between 29 and 30 miles per gallon (highest slightly over 32, lowest slightly over 26). Runs fine on 89 octane and hasn't required the addition of any oil. Cargo room seems endless (I can fit two large laundry baskets behind the rear seats without having to fold them down). I have noticed an occasional light rattle in the driver's side A-pillar, and, when approaching speeds of 80 mph, a humming noise from the passenger side of the front sunroof. Also, parking brake is obstructed when front armrest is down. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Open Sky System, 6-Speed manual shifts excellently, 2.0T engine runs great, not too much electronic garbage, good gas mileage, great cargo room, good handling, exceptional performance, impressive cruise control, overall a great value for the money, superior build quality, excellent front cupholders.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Finally got rid of my SUV for this joy. Drove it on 1200-mile (both ways) trips and seats were comfortable enough not to have to stop every 2 hours, fuel economy was impressive, and you feel like you are glued to the road at highway speeds. Trunk space leaves a little to be desired since you can't even fit golf clubs back there without folding the seats down. Great car though. Wish you could get the options offered on the web at the dealerships without having to buy the entire packages.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Coming off a zippy Mazda RX-8 sportscar, I really was dreading switching to the A3. I thought that a "wagon" really could not be that fun to drive, or perform well. I was wrong. The 2.0T with the DSG transmission and the S-line package is a blast to drive. The steering is a bit light for my tastes (the RX-8's was perfect, so maybe I am just spoiled), but handling, acceleration, power and shifting are all top notch. The Open Sky package was not one I wanted, but I now find it a great way to make the driving experience more enjoyable. The only gripes I have are the control system is a bit too complex and maybe the seats could be a hair more comfortable. Fuel economy is great though.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I upgraded from a very unreliable, but fun to drive, manual, VW Jetta 1.8T. I was nervous about staying in the VW brand but the second I drove the A3, I knew I had to buy it. I thought I'd miss the manual tranny by getting the DSG, but it's more manual transmission than automatic and I don't miss the stick at all. The interior quality is outstanding, the seats are not as comfortable as the A4, but still fine for daily driving. The Open Sky system is a splurge, probably not worth the 1100 MSRP sticker price, but I couldn't imaging the car without it. Golf Clubs don't fit in the back without the seats being folded down, but there is a ton of rear passenger leg room. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It's light, powerful, precise, well-balanced and stops well. Great mileage in Drive mode, wildly fun on mountain roads in Sport mode. Bluetooth and see-around-corners lights and seat heater work well. Very comfortable for driver. Premium comes with good electric seat - for the driver only. Passenger seat manually adjust with big wheel to tilt seat, like our 87 VW Cabriolet - this is a horrible method. Air conditioner works fine on first trip. If restarted when warm, air wants to freeze you, so it ceases to be automatic. Bose stereo is great, but CD changer is very hard to reach and ther is no iPod input! And no workaround except FM transmitter, which is not good in saturated FM market.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased my A3 2.0T after much research and driving the competition. I kept coming back to the A3, and so glad I did. This little vixen grows on you. The DSG, coupled with a very flat torque curve, makes acceleration so effortless that I find myself glued to the rear view mirror. I don't think "Audi made me do it" would stand up in court. Fit and finish is incredible. The sound system is very good (I wanted premium but settled for stock, and no complaints). I've been doing the conventional break-in (vary your speed) and still averaging 27 mpg. Overall I'd have to say this is the finest car I've ever owned. If I win the lottery, I'm going for an A8, but still keeping my A3!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted a 4-door hatchback for flexibility but didn't want to compromise on performance or drive a huge wagon around. There are a lot of sedans in this price range, but the hatch and folding seats give much more utility. I settled firmly on the 2.0T after reviews and test drives, even though it lacked AWD. I drove the 3.2 solely to prevent buyer's remorse and curiosity afterwards, and that was the one I had to get. Outside the trip I took to break it in, I've put more than 2K miles on it in 3 months and that is with restraint (daily commute is <10 miles RT). It is much more fun to drive than my last car (01 Grand Prix GTP) and sometimes I drive past home and just keep going.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The DSG is incredible, though takes getting used to. The stereo also kicks. Car always feels very solid and you can tell the difference between AWD the FWD in cornering. Better (subjective) engine tone than 2.0T. Interior build quality and materials are incredible and comfortable on long drives.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Audi about 9 month ago. It is an ok car overall but very poor quality. So far, I've replaced radiator, check engine light went on twice, and constantly have to add more oil to the car because "Low Oil" light goes on. These are just major problems. It is still fun to drive (when it is not in the shop) but it doesn't perform as new anymore. Another thing to mention is fuel economy. I though it would be an economical car. The gas mileage is great on the highway ( about 29 mpg) and is horrible in the city and stop and go traffic, where I get about 15 mpg!! Considering that you have to buy premium gas, there's no savings. Also, the car is very loud and noisy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove the 3.2 All-Wheel drive but preferred the 2.0T. The 2.0T was more responsive and felt torquier down low. Impressive after coming from a VR6 GTI. I wasn't sure I could give up the MT for the DSG but after driving the car for a couple of days there was no going back to a MT for me. I drove this car back to back with a Mazdaspeed3 and with the DSG I could drive the A3 faster than the Mazda on the same course. The A3 is just too easy to drive fast with DSG. There is some road noise as others have commented on which I atribute to the tires and stiff sport suspension. The ride is very good given the handling abilities of the car. The fit and finish is first in its class.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Okay, so I just bought my new A3 3.2 AWD Quattro today after driving the Volvo S40 T5 and the Acura TL-S. The Volvo was nice, but not in the same class, and the Acura was a great car, but a bit bigger than I wanted. The Audi is an awesome car. So much fun. Some folks say that the power gain in the 3.2 isn't worth the increased price. My feeling (having driven both) is that the 3.2 provides a much more steady power (no lag) and is better suited to the AWD. I felt the same way when I chose my VW GTI VR6 over the 1.8T a few years back. Steady power from the very low RPMs. Beyond that, the build quality is great, the nav system is awesome, and I'm smiling!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 6 months and various trips and weather conditions the DSG A3 keeps going strong. With regular DSG manual shift mode or "S" auto mode we see 24-26 MPG regularly. Unsolicited guests comment on the smooth shifts and strong acceleration. 80 MPH comes too easily on crowded highway jaunts with minimal road noise - keep an eye on the speedometer in Ohio. Snow saw the traction control readily as the wide Pirellis floated and spun. May need winter snows if really interested. Quattro would be nice with the 2.0T. Saw the "check engine light" after a severe temp swing but several key starts apparently reset it before the dealer got a shot. Near 7000 miles and no warranty returns. Fun and sporty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As the owner of an '05 S4 Cabrio, I am a bit spoiled. When it came time to buy a winter and commuting car, I decided to test drive the A3 2.0T with DSG. Honestly, I am not sure which car is more fun to drive! The DSG is such a seamless AT that the car just wants to go, and has almost undetectable shift lag. Put that together with the supreb handling, unparalleled Audi cabin, and high fit and finish overall, and you have one sweet little ride. The hatch and knock-down back seats make it a pretty versatile car as well. My 14 year old keeps telling me about all the chips and performance equipment we could throw at it, but why bother?

<TEXT>Torque steer is nearly absent, dive/squat is absent. Nice power, but could probably use another 30hp. Good pulling power down low for a turbo. Turbo lag is absent. DSG needs to be revised so that it holds the gear at redline in manual mode. Brakes are intially soft which dosen't inspire much confidence. However, the car is extremely well balanced for a front wheel drive car and is very, very fun to drive. Rear cup holders are useless and frail. Otherwise the interior is very thoughtfully organized. Needs MP3 aux. input in base stereo. </TEXT>

<TEXT>When I first saw this car I wasn?t in the market for a new car. I was driving a GTI 2002 and was pretty happy with it until I saw the A3 and fell in love with the looks. Then I drove it, wow!!! No other car has the full time all wheel drive and this much power to boot. The transmission is outstanding. You just point it in the direction you want it to go and it goes with precision handling, dry or wet surface. And sport mode brings the car to another level. I am a big fan of a good 6 speed manual transmission, until I drove this car in sports mode. Everything a manual transmission does without the human error. Perfection. I can?t wait for an S3 or an SR3, hoping it will come out.</TEXT>

The power (and efficiency) of the 4 cyl is amazing. The DSG is a great fun. Once driving, a guy in a Mercedes followed me to a stop light to tell me what a "cool" car it is. The nav system, while a bit complicated, is great. How did I live without it before? Great car. I'd recommend it to anyone. Kill your SUV and get this. You'll be glad you did.

<TEXT>Test drove Honda, Subaru Outback, Mazda CX 7. Drove the A3 and knew this was the car for us (well, it's actually my wife's car). We live in an area where straight roads are rare and curves are the majority. The 6 speed manual is the smoothest and easiest I have ever driven. Living in the mountains, I vowed never to own a 4 cylinder car. But the 2.0 Turbo climbs up long grades in 6th gear with no problem. Steeper grades I have to shift between 3rd, 4th and 5th gears and that just means I am in for whole lot of fun. My wife calls this my mid-life crisis car but she looks pretty hot driving it herself. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the car with DSG, premium and open sky. Red exterior, black interior. The car looks hot, people stare at it all the time. Great performance, great pickup. The mileage has been great so far, going to tahoe from the bay I avg 29.3, coming down I did 28.5 (i was going a little faster). I'm 6'3" and fit well, don't have a whole lot of head room, but it's not an issue. Wish the trunk was a little bigger so my dog could fit a little better (great dane mix), but folding the seats will take car of that. Too bad it doesn't come with quattro in the 2.0T. I would highly recommend this car, it just puts a huge smile on my face everytime I take a turn or press the accelerator. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Tired of the stiff ride in my Crossfire, I needed a bit more room and ease of entry. Enter the A3. Just as fast with a turbo 4 banger as the XFire, and a "softer" sporty ride. Quicker than my wife's 2001 TT, the A3 can pass life's slowpokes with ease, yet makes for a nice "everyday" ride. I can get all the nine luggage pieces of my drum set in easily with the rear seats folded down...and still have room for a friend. Great car for city, highway or the twisties when you can. A month of driving the A3 and it's still love!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The direct injection turbo 2.0 is smooth as glass and quick as a cat, but the DSG tranny is plain fantastic. From "drive" to paddle shifters, it makes magic on the A3.

The interior is spacious, comfortable, with a clean design. We searched most entry-level luxury sedans but the A3 was the clear winner - nothing even compared to the driving performance of the A3.

<TEXT>Third Audi, coming on the heels of a 2001 TT and an '03 A4. This is the Goldilocks car: not too small, not too big, just right. Our commute got shorter this year, so this is basically a city car. Shopped the 330i, the IS 350, the new A4, and the G35. Loved the A3's functionality and nimble, cut-and-thrust attitude.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine/transmission combo, with DSG paddles (my first automatic ever). Beautiful interior, typical of Audi. Handling beats the TT (at least my early model.) Stand-up-and-shout Brilliant Red color. Great tactile sense in the interior design. My insurance company thinks it's a four-cylinder wagon!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my forth Audi, through All Roads and A-4 Avants. $ for $ and pound for pound the best car Audi makes excepting for the discontinued All Road and the A-4 Cabrolet converible which is some $ 12K more expensive to equip. I can do 35-37 mpg with a wax job and no head winds, so I can barely eek out 550 miles to a 13 gallon fill before hitting reserve, but if you want to hold 80 mph on 65 mph interstates and zip past some others in the passing lane, the economy will still hold 28 to 30 mpg. While it does not have some of the useless "bells and whistles" of the A-4 cousin, it's all all around functional car with plenty of storage. Suggest you buy Continental Extreme Contacts, a great all season/snow tire with smoother ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fits my 6'2" frame nicely, pleasure to drive on 500-800 miles day trips, seems like it almost turns by itself like a bobsled by just leaning one way or the other, well almost.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a blast to drive! Short story ? I needed to trade in the 330CIC and get something a little more practical as I was losing my winter driver (16 yr old got her permit) and my wife wouldn?t dare part with her MDX. After a lengthy search I decided to go back to Audi (have owned 3 in the past) to drive the A4. I noticed the A3 and it was love at first stomp on the gas peddle! The DSG is unreal (paddles are fun), pick-up (turbo lag? NOT) is explosive and car is extremely comfortable. Gas mileage is great (30.5 on a recent road trip) & the creature comforts are nice (open sky, cold wthr, premium pkgs.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DSG rocks, sticks to the road like a bad reputation, 2.0T loves to run, leather seats are supportive/comfy and this car makes a 40 yr old have fun driving! Thought I'd miss the convertible, I don't! Oh, gas mileage has been great!</FAVORITE>
