<TEXT>The Speed6 is an amazing car to own and drive. We have had our for almost 2 years, put 36K miles on it, and plan on keeping it around for a while. A Cold Air Intake was installed at 30K miles, does not affect warranty since it was a MazdaSpeed part, but makes the car pull all the way to the redline. Now it is easy to spank WRX's, and give Evo's and STI's something to think about. Slid off an icy road into a snow bank, a check engine light came in so had to take it to the dealer. First time they had seen one in the shop for any reason. Real world gas mileage of 23 in town, 28 highway after the CAI was installed. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Monster acceleration, one of the most comfortable backseats we have ever had, good stereo (with the Bose package), like owning an Evo with nice leather. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Excellent drive, poise and performance. In the winter it is great in snowy Ottawa. 2 seasons of SoloII and SoloI on the tracks, fantastic. There are some gripes. Namely due to the price some components were how i say "left cheap". Being a mod freak, this car serves as an example of what 1000$ of aftermarket parts can do. Purchase a short shifter to replace the mushy shifter feel, drop in cold air intake and a rear engine mount and immediately you have what this car should have been out of the factory, pulls hard now until redline, shifts are precise and no more engine thuds on hard starts. For the price, the 1000$ is negligible and actually fun to do if you are into cars. Now it is perfect</TEXT>

<TEXT>After the recent ice storm I was struck again by how great it is to have all wheel drive. It is very transparent and usually unneeded by me living in the Southwest, but super whenever it rains and a Godsend in ice and snow. I still love the push in the back from the turbo's midrange torque and the great handling and reliability. I average a little under 20mpg because I can't keep my foot out of it, as many BMW and Mercedes owners have found out along with a few Camaro's. Great car and a sleeper in any race!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car for a year now and have had no problems whatsoever. It is still startling fast, especially in the midrange, and has an amazing amount of torque for a 4 cylinder. That allows me to even skip shifts up to higher gears when I feel like it, and doesn't call for me to constantly stay in a certain RPM range like so many turbo's that have more horsepower than torque. I love AWD and the great job Mazda did with the software settings that control the suspension based on driving and the road conditions. I get over 20 MPG avg. and well over 25 on the highway. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD, great body lines, direct injection w/turbo that gives high horsepower and torque from a 2.3 L four cylinder at over 20 mpg in a sedan.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had the car for about 9 months now and am pretty happy. Car is quick and handles very well. At 15k miles check engine light came on though. Purge valve already went bad? It has a little too much lag for my taste compared to my Audi 225tt that I had with an apr ecu upgrade making less hp. Engine seems more like a v6 than a 4 cyl turbo. It doesn't seem to throw me back as much, as the power band is more consistent. Great car overall though. Just need some winter tires! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned dozens and dozens of cars over the last 40 years and I presently have a Ford Lightning and a Suzuki Hayabusa as well so I wanted a four door that wouldn't lean in turns so badly that it would scare me in an emergency, or had mediocre brakes when I am used to having truly great binders verging on racing brakes (especially on my bike) that can get me out of trouble if necessary. I love this car. I had a Mazda 3 before that I had sold an Acura CL type S to buy and never regretted it for one minute. Mazda is simply world class in giving you great handling with very little compromise in the ride quality. The Speed6 excels in every way and it's better than the Porsche Boxster I had. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All wheel drive- you drive on a wet surface and it's like you haven't lost anything- traction, acceleration, braking,turning compared to a dry road. How inspiring (& confidence building)is that in a heavy downpour? The stability control is so unobtrusive it allow some wheel spin and drifting!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I used to be the proud owner of a 2005 RX-8, which I loved, but due to reliability issues (blown engine at 36K miles) and poor fuel economy I decided to look for a replacement. It took something really special for me to give up my RX-8, and the Mazdaspeed 6 was just that. This car is faster than my RX-8 and way more torque down low. Handling is real close to sports car territory even though it is a sedan. More of a grown up hot rod, but a little too much so, a bit more flash would be nice. Also very luxurious, tons of features, and great fuel economy for it's performance level (0-60 time close to a Mustang GT and avgs between 23 and 26 mpg most of the time, try getting that in a stang) </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tons of horsepower & torque, sharp looks, great fuel economy to performance ratio (the base 4-cyl Mazda6 gets the same mpg and has about half the bhp!), tight handling, every amenity under the sun (grand touring model), AWD, 18" alloys, only available in manual trans (the way nature intended!)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am 23, am an extreme enthusiast and let me say I could not be more proud of my Mazda. I blow pretty much every comparable car out of the water. Better performance than an equally equipped 2008 WRX, and still better gas mileage all thanks to direct injection to the spark plugs. Thanks to the incredibly intelligent AWD system, being able to drive 100+mph in the rain brings a sense of extreme satisfaction. I never drive with traction on unless its snowing. DSC prevents 5800rpm shifts, very sharp turns, and launches, and can actually end up killing you because its so intrusive. AWD system is obviously one of the best ever made. You straight up embarass most cars out there for under 30k.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>FWD biased AWD is incredible for weather and predictability. Black on Black is gorgeous. Use the 7k differce between the EVO/STi price tag, and get yourself a bunch of bolt-ons that add about 20hp ATW each. Red gauges are simple and perfect. The launch on this car destroys ANY single axle drive car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I''m an 18 yr old male, so I was looking for the fastest car for my high shcool grad present. I tell people that this car is based on performance, but does not lack at comfort, style, fit and finish, or anything for that matter. The clutch could be a little more sporty, and its not full time 4wd, it's 2wd until only when you need 4, and those are the only things that don't throw a smile on my face instantly. I was looking at a wrx sti and the evo, and this is def in that class. I get like 20-21 mpg primarily in the city, and I'm not shy about using all the rpms. It'll beat your friends cars in performance, looks better, probably costs a little more, but it's all about priorities.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Torque from a 4 banger, horsepower, not much turbo lag, cornering abilities, sound system, virtually keyless, short throw shifter. Smooth ride, fit and finish, big cabin, interier/exterior looks. The best thing; blowing doors off people at any speed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In 18000 miles now, I've been to the dealership 5 times, 4 for service, and once for a check engine light (put crappy gas in it), handles very well, a lot of fun in the rain/snow with traction controll off. Quick off the line. Not quite an STI in performance (heavier and less hp) but really comfortable and a lot nicer inside. Have no doubts about taking clients out in it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the last MS6 that I could find in the cities of Madison, Chicago, Milwaukee and Indianapolis. The car is a great deal and really, really fast. I just got rid of a 2002 5-series (with the 2.5 engine) and this car just smokes it at any speed and is much more agile. Even going from 70 to 90 MPH is a very quick surge. There is just a bit of turbo lag, but it's minimal. A great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in two vehicles before buying my Speed6, a Dodge Ram 1500 and a Ford Focus ZX4 sedan. This car blows them both out of the water by a mile in terms of quality and character. I cross-shopped a few different cars, mainly the Mazdaspeed 3, Volkswagen GTI Fahrenheit, Volkswagen R32, Subaru Legacy GT. I've driven 1000 miles already in 2 weeks, and I absolutely love this car. I find excuses to run errands, and it makes my daily 90 mile commute something to look forward to. Best vehicle I've ever owned, and this is my 7th car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I would have to say that the MS6 is one of the most underrated cars on the market today. Its styling is very subdued and classy, not flashy and obtrusive, which I think helps its appeal. The interior is clean looking with on fuss. The electroluminescent gauges are cool and glow a nice red-orange color. But the defining feature of this car is the performance. This car is awesome! Handles very well, for how large it is, without a harsh ride. Acceleration is in-your-face fast! And the AWD is great for slippery surfaces, especially snow, just needs better tires. Tame when it needs to be, and extremely fast in every way when you want it to.</TEXT>

I have owned BMW, Audi, Ford, Toyota, Jeep, Saturn, Lexus, and Nissan. Now, this is my first Mazda and let me tell you if will not disappoint. I have so many comments on its exterior design and how the lines are clean and they flow. This car drives like a dream and is TIGHT. I am very picky about tight steering and no rattles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>For those of us who don't want to catch the eye of a policeman or look like a Fast&Furious reject, the MS6 is ideal. Like carrying a concealed weapon, you don't have to scare the mundanes as you go about your daily business... but the potential is there when you want to bring it out. With the exception of a heavy short-throw clutch and burly centering-springs on the shifter that need a while to get used to, this is an easy car to drive well. Its poise and balance rival a BMW 335 or Audi A4, and for so much less cash. The interior polish isn't quite up to those standards, but whaddaya want for 27K? Highly recommended for gearheads who don't want to hang with the baggy-pants set.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Outstanding suspension/4WD. Powerful engine that wants to GO GO GO. Room for 4 adults in good comfort. Upright seating position with tons of headroom for over-6-footers. Eight million cupholders (well, okay, six). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a great car. The AWD ensures no torque steer and enhances handling, Mazda gets 270 horsepower (!) from a 2.3 liter 4 giving both great gas mpg and huge performance partly due to the direct injection - runs much cooler, and allows them to put the intercooler on top of the engine and route the ram air into a sealed box around it just like old muscle cars. Extraordinary handling as good as an M3/Audi RS6 with better reliability. Short throw 6 w/3 engine maps, normal/sport/snow, is a great idea. Heavy steering and heavy clutch problems don't exist in '07 so Mazda musta listened.The '07 Speed6 at $30k is simply the best sport sedan under $60k made. They only built about 4k of em so hurry! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, performance, no turbo lag, keyless entry/exit, heated leather seats side bolstered with opposing color stitching.

<TEXT>Owned my Mazdaspeed6 for over a month, and I'm enjoying every moment of it. This car truly defines my idea of a sport sedan. 270 bhp, a 6-speed manual, quick handling, and a comfortable interior. Its 'sleeper' looks keeps red light racers as well as the law looking elsewhere. A slight adjustment to the clutch pedal height has smoothed out an otherwise awkward (high) clutch, but nothing to cry about. Mazda was right to keep the slush box out of this car, as a true driving enthusiast would never want an auto. The car moves thru turns beautifully. The ride is stiff, as you would expect, but not so stiff it's bone rattling. I find myself smiling a lot more than I used to... I wonder why?!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fast...Zoom Zoom. Handles well. Interior is comfortable (I'm 6'5"), and roomy. Enough adjustment to make most people comfortable driving. Sleeper styling keeps unwanted attraction to a minimum. Not many around, adds to its appeal.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was in love with the car for a while, but only 3,000 miles in I noticed the fabric (I have the sport) on the driver's seat was wearing already. It's fraying on the bottom, and I'm a small guy at 155 lbs. The dealer did say it was covered by warranty, but apparently they will only replace them once... not a good sign. It's an odd complaint I know. The other is the wheels and vision. I had a hard time adjusting to the wide turning radius, which resulted in the wheels getting a beating - my fault I know. Otherwise, the car is a blast.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fast. Fast again. Do not buy for a teenager! So far, I love this car. I've only had it 1500 miles, so it's too short for a reliabilty rating. I'm an older adult who appreciates a fast 4dr sedan that doesn't look like a toy boy racer. It's understated looks and power are great. Rides smooth and quiet. In fact a little too quiet, I may have to open the exhaust a bit for more of the deep power sound it deserves. It sticks to corners like it's glued to the asphalt. But the ride is very comfortable, a nice blend of sport and comfort.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's easy to nitpick this car, really. It's pricey for what you get in some ways, and a deal in others. It beats the pants off the Audi A4. The Mazdaspeed rides quiet and with surprisingly well damped bumps. In fact it rides quieter than many entry level luxury cars with softer suspensions. Riding around at 60 mph with the radio on I don't hear the road at all. My knocks against it are the wheels, the tailpipes, the sub-standard turbocharger, and the slightly plastic look of the interior.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for almost three months now. It has major loss of power. I have taken it to the dealer three times now and they finally tell me that the throttle is backed off because of low octane. I can only get 91 in Utah. They should not sell this car in a market that doesn't have the correct fuel. They have done all the PCM upgrades and it has not fixed the trouble. I would avoid this car like the plague if I had it to do over knowing what I know now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am thoroughly impressed with my Mazdaspeed 6. I did a lot of research on the vehicle comparing the TSX, Accord, Camry, Legacy, and Altima. I ultimately chose the Mazda because it simply outperforms any of the other sedans I drove. This car neatly combines the fit and feel of a classy sedan and the performance of an AWD sports car. Perfect for me! The price point is 10-20k less than sedans which offer similar performance such as the BMW or Audi. If you are a person who does not need to brag about owning a BMW or Audi then this car may be great for you.</TEXT>

<TEXT>To compare the MS6 to the EVO or STI is to miss the whole design philosophy in creating this car. Mazda designers clearly stated that the MS6 is not a competition of the above rally inspired track cars but rather against the more refined legacy GT and Acura TL. With this in mind this car can be judged on its merits. The MS6 is a near perfect balance of speed, civility and understated elegance. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Cannot believe the power. Is a real speedster, and surprises many beemers and mbz racers. Have only put 2000 miles on it so far, but some was trip to SF from the OC and got 26+ mpg at "somewhat" over the posted speed limit on the 5. Also, coming down Hiway 1 on return trip this thing drives like it is on rails. My wife is equally impressed, although she maintains that on the first ticket she will take away the keys. Love the shift pattern and feel of the clutch/shift engagment. Still takes some getting used to the start up from signals, but it is so much fun to drive like others I look for errands.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I needed a new family car (I have 3 teenage sons) and had a realistic budget to stick to. I had a deposit down on a Honda Si and had taken a new GTI for a spin. I saw a MazdaSpeed6, looked up the info. on the internet, took the car for a test drive - it was so quick that I scared myself and had to pull over to take a breather with a huge grin on my face. Tons of power, handles like it's glued, cruises great, interior is spot on, exterior is understated. I like that it is a sleeper. I drive spirited - can't wait for my next errand.

<TEXT>I've been a "boy racer" all my life. The past ten years I have had two 3000GT VR4's (AWD/TwinTurbo) and a 300Z Turbo. I finally decided I needed more of a family 4 door, but was dreading being miserable in a sedan that had body roll, automatic, and no torque... until I found the MS6. I am more than pleased. I cannot comment on reliability, but I'm more than thrilled with the performance and handling, especially for a mid size sedan!</TEXT>

<TEXT>As a long time Mazda owner and the owner of a 2004 Mazda 6 V6/5speed, traded in at 60K miles for this 2006 MazdaSpeed6, I have a couple of things to say. The MS6 I own is a piece of junk that has had rear end whine since 1100 miles, has chewed up 2 sets of front tires in 3400 miles, has had a CEL a couple of times, and most importantly, Mazda will not keep their word. I've not driven this car for 6 weeks which is how long Mazda took to decide what to do after reneging on a promise of a buy it back and replace it with another different Mazda.

<TEXT>You might not be able to get better value for the money than this car. It's got all the power you'd ever need, has plenty of room, and the fit and finish are gorgeous. Love the center stack, console trim. Although the 2.3L turbo has a tiny bit more turbo lag than the GTI/A3, it's quite minimal. The styling is also a huge plus. Overall it's slightly understated, but the bad domed hood, 18" rims and upgrading styling really give it that mean look. Highly recommended!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was very content with my 2005 Mazda 6 until I test drove a Speed 6. It's handling, acceleration, and ability to take bumps and curves is unbelievable. It takes all the attributes of other recent small muscle cars and combines them with a big car feel reminiscent of a larger Audi or Saab. Although externally a Mazda 6, and sharing a similar interior and weight it drives completely differently. This car does 0 - 60 mph in 6.2 seconds.</TEXT>
