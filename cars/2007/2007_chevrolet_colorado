<TEXT>My First car I ever bought. This car did alot of 5 hr trips to Mammoth Mountain. Also it was my commuter car... Easily hit speeds I shouldn't have been driving and very roomy. Love the fact that I could fit 6 people in there and did it often. I am still beating myself up for trading this car in for a Jetta... Ugh, the jetta blows compared to this truck!</TEXT>

<TEXT> I have owned this truck (my First) for a few months now and love it. It was used with a little over 9000 miles on it. Very easy to get in and out of. Have the 4 cylinder model which has plenty of power for me and is good on gas. Everyone who has been in this truck comments on how smooth the ride is. There right... takes bumps and bad roads very well! Just one heck of a smooth ride.. i still am amazed to this day how nice it is. The interior is not as nice as it could be but is not that bad either. in all i am pleased with this purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have enjoyed this regular cab truck. after reading the edmunds review my resonse is this is a truck not a muscle or luxury car. I average 21 - 23 city. 25 - 27 highway with the I4. it has plenty of power. I had the bed fully loaded taking my son's stuff to Iowa from Michigan. I got 24 on the way there and 27 on the way back (empty). I have had no major issues with the truck. It is comfortable to drive and I am a big person. Plenty of leg room. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been very satisfied with my Colorado except the service department's bloopers. They created more problems than the truck would normally of had. It has needed work but I would not trade it for any other. I get an average of 26.9 to 28.6 mpg. I guess it depends on how you drive. I do a lot of hauling with it and have pulled my 10' trailer with no problems. Going up hills, it has more power than expected and here is West Virginia that is inportant for all we have are hills. I would recomend the Colorado to anyone as a small economy truck. the tires stink and were dry rotted so be careful but they gave me new ones after 15,000 miles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased this vehicle to replace one of our Security fleet Chevy Cavaliers. Vehicle has excellent acceleration, comfort for driving and setting in. Fuel mileage is near 30 MPG in city & hwy driving combo. Have used to pull a loaded 8' trailer & didn't notice any changes except fuel mileage dropped to 24 MPG.on the hwy. As a security vehicle we have engaged in high speed chases with many different vehicles. The Colorado hasn't been out-run yet or out-performed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I started driving this truck in 2/08, it is my company vehicle. It has as much leg room as my 07 Tundra Double Cab and rides just as good. It did way better in WI winter conditions than I expected. I regularly get 25 mpg on the highway with an aluminum cap and 300 - 500 lbs of tools and stuff in the back. It doesn't have many options, but it hasn't had a single mechanical flaw. I put 100 - 220 miles on it daily and I find the seat in my cheapee model comfortable. Seems to be a little more cabin noise than I would like, but it is so much more comfortable and roomy than S-10's. This is a standard cab with the 4 banger.

<TEXT>Bought truck new. Has been fine other than the lousy fuel economy. 260 miles or less per tank of fuel on the highway, so I am not sure how you others are getting such "good" mileage. Have had the Reduced Power / Check Engine warning light come on 3 times in the last month. First time they said it was a bad battery cell, the second time they asked me if it had been jumped off, to which I answered no! Now I wonder what they will blame it on. It is under warranty thank God and either it will be fixed or else. I am not happy right now and would not recommend the truck to any buyer. I had a 98 Ford Ranger that never gave me a problem. And Chevy is wondering why they are hurting? Duh!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I enjoy my 2007 Colorado Crew Cab Z-71, 4x4. I get about 18 mpg on a tank, with the 5 cyl and Automatic trans (75 - 80mph on highway). Keep in mind I have the trailer towing package and 3.73 gears which are deep. I have the limited slip rear end, so I have a "true" 4x4. I don't think 18 mpg is too bad for a truck like this. One tank I got 20+ mpg. It's solid, well build, far and away better than the S10 (which I also owned). Unlike the S10; my Colorado is comfortable enough to use for those 1,000+ mile trips. I just wish Chevrolet was bright enough to offer the diesel engine, which is available in the Isuzu 370...only in Japan; but, it is the same truck as the Colorado and Canyon.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>While it is loaded with every option, including power sunroof, I wouldn't say it has any features that you can't get on another car, or truck. So to say "favorite" features...I like power options. Hey, I traded a 2002 Cadillac DeVille in on my Colorado, so I might be a little spoiled on features.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I now have owned the truck for 9 months and have almost 11,000 miles on it. I am still very pleased with this economical, reliable everyday truck. I'm still getting 19-20 mpg in everyday driving (even when running the a/c), with 26-27 mpg on trips (at 70-75 mph, no less). The only repairs it has needed in 11,000 miles are a new driver's seat cushion (to fix loose upholstery) and a new HVAC control head (to fix a temperature knob that wouldn't go all the way). Other than those two minor things, it's been completely reliable. I'm a very satisfied owner, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the truck based on my own experience.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I replaced a 2001 GMC Highrider or ZR2 with the purchase of this Z71 4X4. Big difference in build quality between the two with the older model far exceeding the new models parts. No skid plates on new truck, rear drum brakes opposed to disc on the old model however this does get good milage and is a good everyday truck. I have taken a couple 200 mile trips and vehicle is very comfortable and capable. Time will tell how reliable this model is, old ZR2 is bullet proof and is still in the family, son drives it and is going strong with no problems at 110K miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I adore this truck. It's my first, I've wanted one for years. It's comfortable, I love the look, the mileage is good. Just didn't expect to have it in the shop 6 times in the year I've had it. Starting issues, noisy brakes, injector issues, and computer software issues with no fix. Thank God for my warranty. Gets a little sluggish on towing, but I only own the base model. So it didn't surprise me to have to baby the brakes when I have a 950 lb load in the bed. It's rates to tow approx 4k lbs, but I wouldn't pull more than 1k with what I've got.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 3 months, I am very happy with my new Colorado. I purchased the ext cab model with 4 cyl engine, RWD, and auto trans. I use it for commuting (mix of country and city roads) and for light hauling. Most of the time, I am alone in the truck. For the way I use the truck, it works very well. It's economical (19-20 mpg). It has enough room to carry my stuff, and my family can ride along when they need to. The truck is comfortable and very well equipped for what I paid ($16K). The only problem I've had is a loose spot in the upholstery, which was fixed under warranty. It may not be exciting or refined. But, if you're looking for an economical, reliable everyday truck, this is a good one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a new 2007 Colorado 2.9L Automatic, even after reading negative reviews. I'm a consumate Chevy fan but must say that I've had more problems with this vehicle than others. I am hoping everything that will happen, will occur during the warranty period. Had to drop the transmission, fix a blower motor, and now have a leaky roof brake light. Everything has been fixed first time. Excellent ride. eavy and smooth. Good looks and comfortable. 22mpg around town, 25 Hwy at 74 mph. The verdict is still out whether the bugs will all be worked out within original warranty. </TEXT>

<TEXT> Really like the truck. The looks of the truck (z71) is awesome. The 4 door has plenty of room inside and I like the interior. As for power, I think the truck gets along just fine. Why people think a truck needs to be faster than an old muscle car I'll never figure out. The ride is good for a small truck. If you hot rod it, it will suck gas. Drive it normal and it does real well. We average 22-28 mpg mixed driving. No long trips yet. The traction control is annoying. When turning into traffic from a stop on wet roads it will make the truck bog then take off. Could be dangerous. Turn it off and it does just fine. Would rather not have it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The room of the interior fits our small family fine. Nice sounding radio. Looks of the z71 pkg. Pulls a trailer with 2 fourwheelers with no problem.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At less than 10000 miles reduced power and check engine light kept coming on about every two or three weeks. I called the dealership and waqs told that I would have to drive it in with thr reduced power on for them to find the problem. As I write this the truck is under the garage and will not start. Put in new battery and stil nothing. Will call dealership tomorrow and have it towed to the shop. Very disappointed in a truck that's only a year old. Never know what going to go wrong next.</TEXT>

I'm not sure about the reviews that say this truck is underpowered compared to foreign trucks with V6's. It's a truck, not a dragster.I have no complaints on acceleration. This is a solid truck.

<TEXT>A very enjoyable and capable truck. Bought a 3LT Z71 4X4. Gets pretty good mileage 20-22 MPG to and from work. On a road trip (2000 miles) we got 23 MPG. Plenty of power when you need it but not the fastest. Got leather seats and is comfortable. This truck is way ahead of the S10 I replaced. Bad side: Had issues with steering shaft at 500 miles. Only to find out it was a common problem (GM knew) and then had to wait due to nationwide backlog. If they knew this upfront, they should have fixed it prior to selling it. As a result I have a bad taste in my mouth about GM (and we are a GM Family). May consider another brand on next purchase. But since it has been fixed we have had no issues.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had this model for one year. There have not been any problems thus far and to myself it is an improvement over the S-10.There are gas issues...to wit: using 87 octane will cause the engine to be stubborn or bucking as such. Using 89 octane takes care of that. But the tires are something else. The are Generals made in Mexico and they are absolute junk! I would think that Chevy Division would do something about this. No use in going the warranty route since the replacements will be of the same junk. Three of the four tires have bumps on them. Lastly, the hand-brake release needs to be better engineered since at times I have to pull, pull, and pull on the brake release handle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have 2500 miles on the truck. Taken two trips totaling 800 miles getting about 25 mpg on highway and 18-20 normal driving. Pulls 3000 pound boat ok. Seems kind of small from the Z71 ext cab I bought new in 04 but traded for gas mileage and it is doing better than the 14-15 the Z got. If getting the 4cyl, go with the 5 speed if you plan to do any pulling. It will run highway speed with a load in 4th without much trouble but 5th is useless with a trailer. As far as driving empty, it has plenty of power, haven't had to take it past 5000 rpm yet when pulling or passing. Mine has the 3.73 gear ratio I think this is the best ratio as it would be turning a lot or rpms in 4th with the 4.10.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rides really good and it is quiet at speed. Passing power is good from 50-70 but you have to use 3rd gear. Factory receiver hitch is a nice feature. Ride height of the z85 suspension package is good for hooking up to a trailer.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Truck looks excellent. Acceleration is great. Been having fuel efficiency problems for the last two weeks since I took the truck in for recall of computer. Computer had to be reprogrammed because the truck would not idle upon cold start. Truck is brand new 4 cylinder automatic, but is guzzling gas like a full sized pickup. I got better gas mileage on my old V6 4x4 SUV. Dealerships are trying to make me wait thousands more miles (break-in?) before they remedy the problem. Ride is fun but bouncy. Cheap interior but still nice looking. Base seating has absolutely no adjustment worth a darn. I like the truck, I just want better gas mileage.

<TEXT>Now that I haved driven this truck for 6 months, I wanted to update my initial review of 9/24/06. Most of the rough idle and cranking problems were solved with a software update to the onboard computer module. Soon after, I had to take it back for a defective ignition switch. (Engine would die suddenly while you were driving along!) Since that first month, I have had no problems whatsoever with the vehicle. I will say that this is the first vehicle that I have ever gotten so many questionnaires about.(5 so far,I think.) Most included a new one dollar bill.

There still is a little too much plastic on the inside, but overall this is a fun truck to drive. I can't speak to the reliability until I've had it awhile. Steering is crisp and responsive. Braking could be a little better. The interior cosmetic changes are nice too.</TEXT>

I will admit that the interior plastic could be firmer but I am sure the factory has reasons for the flexible plastic now used.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good steering, decent braking. Interesting shifting with the 5-speed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2004 Toyota Tacoma for this 2007 Colorado because I wanted to go back to Chevy trucks. Two days after I got it, the engine, when cold, cranks and dies, then idles extremely rough until it warms up. Dealership service tells me they never heard of a Colorado doing that before. Translation: "We probably can't fix that" The truck is fine bodywise and interiorwise, but in my humble opinion you might want to wait until they get all the bugs out of this new 4 cylinder powerplant.</TEXT>
