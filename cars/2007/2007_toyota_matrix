<TEXT>Just purchased a 2007 base model w/ 5- spd, the "M Theory" package, and 36000 miles. Right off the bat got 31 MPG cruising at 77 MPH w/ AC on intermittently. Then cruising at 71 MPH on the way back w/ AC on full time got 35 MPG. So far I like the way it handles, the power is acceptable (but not sports car fun), but most importantly it a very useful car (parking, cargo, cost). "M Theory" is purely for looks, bright color but not worth extra $$$ for most.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this Matrix used with only 8K and the original warranty - traded in my turbo 07 Forester which required premium gas and got 22mpg when premium went to $4.50/gallon. Computed the mpg on the Matrix with the first fill-up - got 36mpg!!! I cried! I love this car. I consistently get 32-36 mpg combined. Miss the sunroof and AWD of the Forester but got such a deal on the Matrix - bought snow tires and traction now as good as AWD. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>For some reason I love the looks of the Matrix more than the Vibe - I smile whenever I see mine or others out on the road. Mine is sky blue, love the color. Love the ride. Love the interior space. Love the features and reliability. Most of the same features as Subaru but cheaper - better value!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a Subaru for the Matrix and I miss the power. The Toyota is a nice solid car and fits a dog well, lots of storage, very comfortable driving and comfortable for four adults. The center console is messy and doesn't fit a coffee cup w handle. Acceleration is kind of lame, you have to be light on the gas or you'll squeal the tires. I'll keep it because it's so economical and dependable. I haven't put a cent into it. But it is boring and really pretty terrible in the snow we have in Michigan. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good mileage, comfortable. Excellent storage inside, good dog car (cleans easily, good spot for the dog in the back). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased this car two years ago and haven't had any trouble with it. It's engine is noisy especially when the air conditioner is being operated. Driving up hills can add to the noise. The interior is useful and it comes it handy when transporting odd shaped objects. All in all I would purchase this vehicle again. I have to say it's a great transportation car and the price was just over $13000.00 (new) gas mileage is only twenty -two combine but gets a good 32 mpg on the highway to and from Vegas. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior. Sound system sounds pretty good for factory system. High mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a 2005 Matrix until I was T- boned on driver side after a minivan ran a red light at 50 mph. Car was totaled, but I walked away with all limbs & I was so happy w. the safety of side impact that I bought another Matrix (2007). I love it! City MPG on manual trans. is about 29-30 MPG (I calculate it every so often). I am only 5'2" so I like that the seat raises and I don't have to be too close to the steering wheel. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats, Remote Keyless Entry, look of car, hatchback & interior space/room, location of cup holders, easy clutch/pedals to push, great for shorter peeps</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Can't say enough good things about this car. If you're short, this car will fit you very well - no longer have to have steering wheel in my chest to reach pedals. My husband wanted me to buy one with extra (6 total) airbags but they weren't available in L.A. area. Fleet Mgr. found one from Oxnard area. In that pkg I got nicer wheel covers, moon/sun roof, 5 CD changer and the extra airbags. I think my stereo rocks. Maybe I got a better one? Used the car to move things out of my mom's estate. I have picked up materials for kitchen remodel. Have averaged 30 mpg in heavy traffic & city driving. I'm sure I'd get 40+ on long drives. When necessary I can punch it and get the power I need.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned my Matrix for about 13 months now. I have to say that I?m constantly reminded of how good of a decision it was to buy this car! I traded down from a 4runner, and I have to say that I don't miss the cargo space. The cargo space provided in this matrix is unreal. The driving performance is good, the interior is good, and the fuel economy is good. Lets be honest if you're looking at this car it?s to be economical, and you can't expect top of the line performance for the price. But for versatility, there aren't many out there that can't beat this. I definitely recommend this for anyone trading down from a SUV. Handling is firm and responsive, and fun to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the Speedway Blue M-Theory Special Edition. Awesome 17" wheels & spoiler. Chicks love the car! Seriously. Mine's a 5 speed & still has little power, but I don't mind. I usually get about 32 mpg, but I drive about 80% city miles. Haven't been on a long road trip to test strict highway mileage. I'm 6'3" & car has plenty of room for me. The seat is only halfway back! Ride is a little rough with "sporty" suspension on M Theory. Occasionally clicking sound in brakes, dealer says is normal - that's a little annoying. Fun to drive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is such a fun car, considering it can seat four adults in comfort or carry a whole ton of stuff. The back seat is easy to drop flat, yet is a real full-size adult seat when it is up. Despite being a proper little utility vehicle, it also has great handling and a peppy engine - you never want for power yet the fuel economy is great (35+). I do believe you need to choose the manual transmission with the available power here - the automatic is much slower and also harder on gas. And I think it's a looker! One of my favorite details is the optitron gauges - I know those are becoming much more common these days, but I like how easy they are to read.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The fact that I put on over 24k in the first year of ownership should tell you how much I like this car. My highway mileage when keeping the car between 65-70 has been routinely 38 mpg. In town, 29 mpg. In terms of "fun to drive factor", this car has not disappointed. By fun, I don't mean lots of torque. Think nimble, like a Mini Cooper or other small wheel base car with perhaps a little more oomph. The power is more than acceptable for a commuter car. The capacity is deceiving, with the seats down, I fit 8' lumber with no prob. Headroom is excellent, my 6'5" friend sits inside with room to spare. DIY maintenance has been easy with only oil & filt change and tire rotation every 5k.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mileage. Reliability. Capacity. The fact that I still smile everytime I drive it. Capability in snow & rain. Mine is 2WD, and I still take it off- road & have needed to winch it out only once. I love the styling, I looked at its sister, The Vibe, but it didn't do it for me. Tires have nice grip.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have loved driving my Matrix on trips and around town. The gas mileage is OK. This is my fifth toyota and I find myself constantly comparing, which I should not do. I find that there is a lot of room especially when the rear seats are down. A mat would have been nice to cover the whole cargo area. I have read many revues on the car but have not yet seen my pet peave yet, which is a roof rack. It is so very expensive to fit this car with a roof rack. I cannot believe it's not an option. But I guess, given the overall performance, gas mileage and especially the handling, it still comes in as a number one car for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a nice car. Excellent mileage, easy to drive, comfortable, for a small car. Lots of road noise, but it's a small car. The deal killer for me, is you can't lock the doors with the remote if the door(s) are open. You get home from shopping, it's raining, you have to get out, unload your stuff in the puddle filled driveway, getting your stuff soaked, fish your keys out of your pocket, lock the car, and get your stuff. Had I known about this "feature", I would have not bought this car. Instead of pushing the button, you have to hold the button on the remote to open the glass hatch. It's faster to use the key. Bad design choices.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our Matrix this summer to replace our aging and unreliable Plymouth. It has been a great decision so far. We have taken it on several weekend trips and it is a great travel car. Lots of room in the back for the bags and the dog! It has also been useful in around town driving. The fold down seats in the back are one of the car's best features. We never need worry about bringing home bulky items. I don't find problems with highway driving that others have mentioned. No issues with wind or milage. We average 30-31 mpg around town and 40+mpg on the hwy. Though heavy traffic or driving consistently above 65 mph drasitcaly reduces fuel economy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After having been driven an Aurora and spending thousands of dollars on gas and repair, I decided to buy a Toyota car.

<TEXT>After 11,500 miles the Matrix is finally broken in enough to review it. The usable space is fantastic. It has plenty of zip for city/town driving (especially w/ TRD performance filter). Ours is loaded as possible w/ sunroof, wheels, upgrade stereo, ABS, airbag package, trim package, etc. These cars look silly w/o the extra trim IMO. My disappointment rests in the cars rattles in the dash and elsewhere. Way too new for this, and whatever happened to legendary fit and finish. Lousy Gdyr tires and their harsh ride had some to do w/ onset of rattles (better ride and fewer rattles now w/ Michelin tires), but it's still no excuse. Best mileage thus far has been 33 mpg (highway), disappointed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>At the risk of sounding like all the rest, this car is fun to drive. It's a great car for the practical value- seeker that wants a decent level of extras without settling on an "econo- box". The XR sport package gives it just enough style to stand-out and satisfy the sport-minded. Mind you, the true sports-car enthusiasts aren't even looking at this car...this is a car for the person that wants a basic car with a little bit of everything and an emphasis on fuel economy. I've been getting 34mpg in my 1st 4500 miles on a 70-mile/day commute in mixed traffic conditions. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Tight steering, peppy pick-up. Comfortable seating. Super cargo versatility. Moonroof and ventilation are very good. I'm sensitive to claustrophia and this car feels open and airy. Quiet compared to my former Honda CR-V.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a change. I drove a V6 van before. The car only having a 4 cylinder has been a joy to drive. Instead of buying an SUV during my midlife crisis I have downsized to an efficient compact.The cargo area is great. The fuel consumption is low. I live In the second most traffic congested city in North America (Toronto). We pay $1.00 per litre of gas ($4.50 per gallon of gas). </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Toyota Matrix is a great car for both versatility and fuel mileage. The hatchback is very convenient, great for hauling the family around and a trip to the hardware store. I generally get 27 to 29 MPG averaging 40 miles an hour to and from work. Highway is better, city is a little worse. Car has great pickup and is definitely fun to drive. Looks great too. I would strongly recommend the premium package with sunroof as it is a great deal for the money. Have driven almost 21,000 miles in less than a year and still love the car and plan on keeping for a long time. Road noise can be a problem but you get used to it. It is very hard to find other faults with this car. Handles nice too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Life long full size pickup owner here, but decided to commit to reduced fuel use. I parked my full size pickup and purchased this for a work vehicle. I farm for a living, and I was thinking of a Tacoma, but was not sure the mileage would be good enough to switch, so decided on the Matrix. Fuel mileage is 30-32 so far, on 1000 miles drive, with short distance on and off pavement driving. Loads of fun to drive as well! I couldn't be happier! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel mileage, hands down. I have not gotten less than 31 mpg yet, and I drive a lot of small trips, and into farm fields with low speed driving. Small light easy to fit into tight spots, fun to drive. Roomy interior, I am 6'2" 235 lbs, and am quite comfortable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought ours despite all the reports that the steering wheel is too far away, etc. I am 6' 4" tall, (wife 5'4") and I am very comfortable in the front and rear of ours. My wife and 10 yr old daughter love it too. Our gas mileage runs about 27 overall, but our first trip got 38.5 MPG!! Beats the minivan we traded for it big time. We like the cargo room and are very familiar with the Toyota reliability. We are pleased in every way with this car, even on trips. We highly recommend any Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far I love this car. I downsized from a full size truck and was not sure if I would like it due to the size difference. But the money saved in gas says it all. This car is fun to drive. Even with a 1.8 under the hood it has a quick start. There is room for a family of 4 to fit. My son is 6 foot 2 inches and still has leg room when sitting behind me. Car has great cargo room. I love the fact the rear glass opens separately from the hatchback door if you need to haul something over 8 feet in length. I have only had this car for a week so I will be doing a follow up review in a few months.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you're looking for a combination of cargo room, gas mileage, styling and performance this is the logical choice. More sporty looking than the Vibe in my opinion. If you want to look good while saving at the pump it's this or a mini-cooper. You can probably fit the mini-cooper in the back of your Matrix if you fold down your back seats, but all I need to fit inside is two bicycles, so no problem. If you're like most people and don't really need an SUV, this is the smart mpg alternative. The manual trans is more fun to drive, but I can eat better in traffic with the automatic. This is not a sports car, so don't expect pony car power, its fine especially compared with other 4 bangers.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Cargo room, 34 MPG, sunroof, driving height, red exterior, fog lights (cool factor), driving lights, nice 6 speaker 6 CD player. I have to admit I like seeing the outside temperature, however I'm not sure why b/c I live in FL. 115v outlet is great idea, way better than cigarette lighter. STYLING!:)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With the gas prices soaring, I decided to trade in my SUV and get something with better gas mileage. The snag was that I still wanted the cargo space that my SUV gave me. That is what lead me to the Matrix. Honestly it is doing the job in excellent fashion. I haven't had it for long, but I know that it will prove to be a good buy. The drive quality is good, and responsive, the handling is better than I had expected. All in all it has everything that I was looking for. I definitely reccomend this if you are looking for space, fuel economy, and a sporty good look all rolled into one reliable, affordable vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got rid of my Nissan Pathfinder for this ride. I've put 800 miles on it so far without any problems. The manual tranny shift is at hand level which makes changing gears pretty effortless. Overall the vehicle is quite nimble and fun to drive although the engine is noisy in 1st and 2nd gear. Once up to speed it rides well. Mileage is a solid 26 city, 29 highway. As others have noted the suspension is stiff so when you hit a bump or pothole you feel it. As you know the storage is fantastic with hatchback convenience. If you haul a lot of outdoor gear like skiis, camping equipment or a bike this is the car for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT>With gas prices threatening to be higher than last year I decided I needed my highly modified Oldsmobile Cutlass to NOT be my daily driver. A fully loaded Yaris is a rarity, but a loaded Matrix M-Theory is not. Compared to others the options to price seem very good. The best mileage so far has been 28 mpg of combo driving. That was with the dealer's complimentary tank, which leads me to believe it was over filled slightly. 25 mpg is the norm. Performance is anything but. The engine is NOT performance oriented at all. If you want something quick this isn't it. However it does handle quite well. Ride is firm, sometimes harsh, but still comfortable. For looks and features I'd recommend it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This vehicle has every option that I could want. I consider that good for $22K. Others in this class would run about $3k higher for all the options included. The 7 speaker stereo with 6cd in dash changer isn't bad either (: While the mileage isn't phenomenal, it's better than most in it's class.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I can't say enough good things about this car! I've had it since December, and already put almost 8000 miles on it! The gas mileage is amazing (~35 miles to the gallon) on the beltway. The design and handling are great! It's a smooth ride, and there is more than enough room for myself and my family of four! More cargo room than any of the other "wagons" out there, and it's a cute sporty mom car for the young at heart who aren't ready to graduate to the minivans, but also not willing to suffer the cost of fuel in an SUV!</TEXT>

This Matrix has already pulled itself through the snow, is a joy to drive, reliable, and the gas savings is amazing! I also got everything that I had in the Jeep into the Matrix. Yes, it is smaller and the steering wheel is a bit closer to the dashboard than I am used to, but it is worth getting used to it over time. Definitely check this car out!

<TEXT>My Matrix XR replaced a Honda driven 10 yr, 250k and loved. I have yet to develop same affection for Matrix. After 10k it seems reliable, functional, economical, fun to drive. 5 sp shift is smooth but has a unique click sound each shift. Some design features are at times inconvenient or annoying. Visibility out side and back suffers. Front and rear seat headrests are always in way, same for body/roof posts. Warning signal for unbuckled seatbelts is loud, obnoxious. Why all the noise when passenger unbuckles to remove coat or briefcase or box is on passenger seat? And panic button on the key fob is horribly designed. How many times have I accidentally set it off? Please don't ask my neighbors!</TEXT>

<TEXT>So many practical reasons to own this car: excellent gas mileage, lots of cargo room, Toyota reliability, flat-folding seats. But what sold me on it was that it's just a fun car to drive. The handling is enjoyable, the engine is more willing than its 126 hp would imply, the interior is cockpit-ish, the 6-cd sound system is decent, the seats are comfy with cool fabric, and the ride is nicer than the competition's. It's a nice mix of good stuff for the money. I was considering a Civic, but the Matrix had more cargo space, a nicer ride, a nicer interior, and was way more fun to drive. The auto I test drove was good, but I recommend a manual trans with any small engine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have to laugh re: those people complaining about "rides like a truck". Probably most have not HAD a truck. Definite car-like ride, I have 1,000 miles. No rattles, good layout inside (agree with the remark about the blower speed knob in front of transmission lever when in "park", although one would usually use the a/c when driving). Handles well, good acceleration for this type, no tire squealing, no rattles, and I like the styling better than the pontiac Vibe. Good stereo, I have the ABS and sunroof too. I got it for cargo space, flexibility, and true hiway mpg of over 35 (31 around town) .Mostly I use my motorcycle but sometimes I need a car, and a Corolla underneath - great.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable seats, adequate acceleration (it IS an economy car - my previous truck could pull 8000 lb and had a V8, but got half the mpg and more "busy" ride), versatile interior. I like cloth interior (leather too hot in Florida).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Rented a brand new '06 Matrix (1K miles) on a vacation trip. We were thinking of buying one, so it was a great to test one out for an extended period of time. Gas mileage was great, but it lacked power (was very loud as it kicked into lower gears on hills - 2 people and luggage), accelerator was very sensitive, and the interior felt very cheap. Seats were comfortable for a few hours but sagged after a while. Should be OK for local commutes. Exterior shape is pleasing to the eye but put together cheaply. We hit a small pothole at low speed (5mph) and one side of the front air dam popped off. Found out that it was held together by plastic screws when I went to snap it back together!</TEXT>

I love the comfortable seats, the high seating position, the interior space (headroom in particular) and the incredible gas mileage. You won't find a better value in this price range, all things considered.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable seats, well-finished interior, great gas mileage, perfect size.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>While the gas mileage was a definite plus, the lack of power in this vehicle and the size of other vehicles when driving the Matrix, made me get rid of it. I didn't have any problems with it mechanically. I guess the 4 cyl ran as it was supposed to. I haven't had a 4 cyl for years so maybe it is just me, but the car lacks power and is loud. Low profile made for uneasiness driving in rainy weather. Being in Western PA, I felt that I should get rid of it for when it snows. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After my 98 Pontiac Sunfire became too expensive to fix, I had no choice but to purchase the Matrix XR, 2007, sport suspension. After driving it for almost two weeks now, I can say I like the handling, the way it drives around the corners, good mileage, roomy inside. The only thing annoying is sometimes something rattles from the dashboard, but I can put up with it. I wish it had more power going uphill, but then again I like my mpg (actually around 30). I like to drive fast.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I only have 200 miles on my Matrix XR but I already love it. The seat are high which is great. I can drive next to the smaller SUVs and the seats are just as high as the person next to me but the car is smaller. The seats are amazingly comfortable in front... back seats too. I love my Matrix.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Driver seat sits high is height adjustable. Back window opens without having to open the whole hatch. Headlight reminder beeps so you don't accidentally leave lights on. Just breaking it in so I'm getting 30 mpg. Tires are lower profile & wide.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Matrix is a Corolla wagon and is very similar to the Dodge Vibe. It has been a fun car to drive. What it lacks in power it makes up for in gas mileage. The interior of the hatch-back trunk is plastic so things can easily slide around. There are nets but we bought a mat that has helped to keep things from sliding around.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seats can go down in the forward direction. The manual is nice because we did not like the way the automatic shifted gears and it saves more on gas.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Car handles pretty well. Also pretty generic looking car with number of issues. 1) My new car dash rattles ( I know, take it to the dealer). 2) 4 speaker stereo is bad, you can't hear it when sitting on back seats. Back seats are very uncomfortable, too. 3) Interior seat covers cheap. 4) Outside paint is very thin and pretty easy to scratch. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My third day in this car, and I love it! This car truly is a very practical alternative to the SUV. It's fun to drive, and styling is good. Very roomy interior and plenty of room for cargo. I drove a mid-size SUV for years, but honestly, I don't have kids and I'm not hauling lumber, so why waste the money on an SUV. I'm very happy with my Matrix.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Daytime running lights, dash board configuration, many storage compartments, cupholders, cargo area, glass hatch pop, Very happy with this car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased a 2007 Matrix XR at the end of August. I wanted a car with a reliable reputation and ABS that went a bit beyond the Corolla that has been in the family for the last 5 years without any problems. I carefully read all reviews and find the car (to date) worth the investment. The fold down seats in the back are an advantage when the extra space is needed. Gas mileage (open road -36/37 mpg); city and open road about 27) is very good. I recently had the opportunity to drive my sons 2000 BMW 320i. I found the Matrix to be better handling; of course he can get to 40 mph or more in a 35 mph zone faster. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage and handling with wide profile tires are among my favorite features. Also, the height of the driver's seat provides a positive SUV feel. Storage space is a plus along with the braking and air system. All Matrix owners I have encountered say the car is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded a Pilot that got 18 mpg in on this Matrix for the same reason as everyone else. I have only owned it a week so some of the ratings of 9 are minor things, really not worth mentioning in detail. A squeak here and there on the interior but overall a solid vehicle. I was amazed at the room inside. Being 6'4", I couldn't believe the room. I am looking forward to driving by the gas stations. I am curious to see though how it does in the snow. Overall, a positive experience and I would recommend this car to anyone.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior room in the front seat. Glow of interior at night. Automatic lights. 4 Cyl has a surprising amt of zip.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 1,000 miles, I have no regrets. Bought for its gas mileage and versatile interior which are even better than I expected. Ave. 29 mpg local and 37 mpg highway. Driver's seat is high, but I'm short so its fine. Added side air bags, stability and traction control, ABS, window tint and leather seats. The versatile interior is great whether carrying groceries or lumber. A more powerful engine would be nice, but I'll take the mpg. A comfortable car mostly driven locally. I have no doubt this was an excellent purchase.</TEXT>

<FAVORITE>Gas mileage was the primary reason for purchasing; the overall performance and appearance as well as eye-appeal were frosting on the cake.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I agree with the previous review that the Matrix is possibly the best compromise in size, comfort, fuel economy and handling. Zippier than the bigger beast I drove before, but definitely not the greatest sports-car handling. Love the storage and gas mileage. Put my bike in the back on its side with the seats down without removing the front wheel. I upgraded to get the side airbags. Stereo is excellent. Great for mostly city driving, with lots of potholes and stop-and-go driving. Plenty of headroom, but for someone 6'1" I'd rather sit an inch or two lower than the seat will go. Still breaking it in--but I've only filled up the tank once in the past month. THAT I can live with!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first car since 1972 or so, I can't remember, and that was a Toyota Corolla/great car that gave me 41 MPG on highways thru Texas. Great car and I never forgot it. I have been driving vans and trucks since and this year we decided to by a car and I went to the Corolla first and then to all the competitors too I test drove them all and wound up with the Matrix, drives like the Corolla and had tons of room with seats that go down and even the front passenger seat goes down. To make a long story short we love the Matrix and our first tank of gas on the highway with the air going did 37.3 MPG Next tank was city at 30. Third tank 33 city & hway. What can I say.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I guess the seats and all the room in the back. Nice cruise contol I use it a lot and keeps the engine rpms low adds to the gas economy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Matrix is quite possibly the best compromise in size, comfort, fuel economy, and good looks. A quiet and smooth drive, with "peppy" acceleration I did not expect from the horsepower ratings. Great fuel economy (28.5 mpg in 80/20 city/hwy driving), and spacious interior. This was my SUV "alternative," and so far, so great. I'm personally a big fan of the exterior styling, although the interior dash could use a "refreshing" a la the new Camry. Toyota quality is excellent - the doors close with a solid "thwump" - not that empty, hollow-door feeling.</TEXT>
