<TEXT>Overall, a very nice car with an air of high luxury. As for reliability, had a squealing noise which was a pulley bearing subject to recall. Dealer fixed with no hassle. We now have a strange rattle from the vicinity of the differential. Of course, it stopped when we took the car to the dealer and hasn't yet returned. Performance -- acceleration, braking, handling -- is just okay by my standards but I race cars, so I have high standards. This is primarily my wife's car. For the typical purchaser of this car, the performance is more than adequate. Not too happy about the high depreciation, but we plan on retaining the car for a while. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior of our car is its best feature. We have the two tone ivory/black leather, with dark ash wood and chrome trim. The fit and finish and overall look is outstanding. The interior looks better than most $100K cars.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I went from a Boxster to a CLK350 Cabriolet because I started to play a lot of golf and needed more room, but couldn't bring myself to buy an SUV. Mistake! The trunk is small - won't hold two sets of clubs easily. Even with one set, I have to pull out my longer clubs and put them in separately. The back seat very difficult to get into. Front seat won't stay forward unless you readjust it. What a pain. Windscreen completely obnoxious to install/remove. The most annoying thing is the "ding ding ding" when you open the door. I hate it and dealer won't shut if off. Enough to make me sell the car. If you press a button on steering wheel though, you can shut it up. Beautiful car otherwise.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got a 2007 CLK convertible. Good looking. Fun to drive. But, it has been in shop for 4 times for different problems, started at month 3. Today speakers stopped working. I remember the sale person asked me to buy extended warranty. I said MB is supposed to be a car with high quality. He said not true. I did not believe his word. Now I regret. No more MB.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I previously owned a 2003 CLK500 and let me tell you that the new 550's engine completely blows away the previous version. The accelleration and overall performance is incredible. The exterior and interior are stunning. Practically every time I drive it someone is telling me how beautiful it is. Go get one today.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an extremely fast car, with terrific brakes, a genuinely usable back seat, and decent trunk space (for a convertible). Unfortunately, the steering detracts markedly from the driving experience. Drive the new 3 series convertible, and you will wonder why anyone would pay almost double for the Mercedes, as the 3 series is loads more fun to drive. I had the 3 series, but traded it because of the minuscule trunk space and issues regarding run-flats. I like the AMG--but I have to admit-- reluctantly--that the 3 series was much more fun, at just over half the price, and it gets much better gas mileage. However, given the trunk space issue with the BMW, I am glad I made the switch.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Thumbs up CLK class</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Mercedes has taken the CLK to the next level. Purchased a 350 coupe w/sport suspension and have enjoyed the car from day one! Suspension is a nice balance between sporty and smooth...it doesnt beat you up. It is a blast to drive and has an elegant design. Performance and handling compares to BMWs and Porsches we've owned. Access to the rear seats is a little cumbersome, but if I wanted easy back seat access I would have gotten an E- class.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My chief complaint of this car is it has no locking glove compartment. For God's sake Kia's have locking glove compartments. How do you turn your vehicle over to a valet? Presumably a Mercedes would likely visit valet parking more often than most? Add to that, access to the rear seats comes from lifting and pulling forward the rear seat. Cars half its price have electric motors that do it. Its like driving an old Euro taxi. Build quality, first year, 3rd brakelight lens cover fell out when trunk closed, whining belt pulley,seatbelt not retracting correctly. Wife's '06 E series needed new tranny first 3 months of owning. Not your daddys Benz.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned the CLK 350 CAB, a 550 CAB, and now upgraded to the CLK 6.3 AMG. This car is exhilarating--the engine is amazing, the suspension is almost perfectly tuned--it provides a nice balance between a firm, sporty ride without beating you up, it has back seats that are actually usable, and it flat out goes! I have a few minor gripes-- for a car in this price range, things like NAV, Xenon lights, etc. should be standard. Gas mileage is poor in the city, but surprisingly not bad on the freeway--I average over 24 mpg cruising at 80 mph. Drive one and you will likely buy it--if it's too pricey, opt for a 550, but get the sport suspension--it makes a huge difference.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having parted with my '05 Audi A4 3.0 Cab, I knew I would have to do with out the topless experience. What I didn't know was that I would have to do without a locking glove box. I would also have to lift and push forward the front passenger seat to let someone in the back. Much like an old European taxi. At this price point you shouldn't have to make these basic sacrifices. We have two Merc's at home, when leases end, we will have none! Ever.</TEXT>

The looks of this car are stunning with the AMG package. Not to mention a hand-built engine that is to die for. The price for this car is a little on the high side for the market but in comparison to the M6, it is an overall better car. Highly recommend for any high performance car enthusiast, it will be a nice treat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. Candidates: M3, 911, S4. The highway is not a race track. No do I have to endure the harshness of my 996 to have neck breaking speed and a boat load of "cool factor". This thing is a serious wolf in sheeps clothing. The power, torque and hp, is amazing. The ride is plush, more body roll than my Porsche and BMW, even with the sport suspension, but I got over it quick enough. It is still well composed in the twisties. I am waiting for my H&R lowering springs to arrive and for $600 the body roll be gone. Cops don't even notice it. Great car! Of course it eats tires and gas, but a car with 386 ft #s of torque should!</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you get a CLK550 Cabriolet, the sport suspension option is a must have. Had mine trucked down to N. Cal. from Wash. State, since it was only one in Western USA with sport suspension (for me), run flats (for wife), backseat side airbags (for son), and P3 option (best front seats). It has every opt. except power trunk closer. This is the best Mercedes I've every owned, and been loyal customer since bought 380 SL in 1982! Solid build, no problems, performs better than last year's AMG model for $20K less, quiet with the top up. 0-60 mph on mine is much faster than 5.1 sec. spec. It can go 65+ on 25mph curved exit w/o ESC. Wish I could take it to Germany and drive it on the Autobahn!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the car with what I think to be the standard exterior styling package which makes the car look like an AMG tuned sports car (with AMG rims etc). Has beautiful Cappuccino Brown/Black Leather-Sport leather seating with an amazing leather interior. More comfortable interior than any coupe in its class. Test drove new 3-series coupe but fell in love with the powerful CLK. with 3500 miles, still have fun and remain comfortable driving the car. Must get Xeon lights and ventilated multi-contour seats for maximum comfort. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My first MB but not my first driving experience. I have been chauffering my Mom in her S500s for years never dreaming I'd be shopping for a MB myself. Test drove the CLK550 and that was it! What a jewel. A real pleasure to find the combination of coupe and convertible with such style and pizzaz! It is perfect. Few things ever are. It sure suits my fancy and makes my day just a little brighter and more interesting. The one complaint I have aesthetically is the choice of rag tops. Whatever happened to that beautiful "buff" colored cloth. Black, Ash and Navy don't suit every one's taste!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just upgraded from 350 cab to the 550 cab. The engine on the 550 is amazing. Too bad the rest of the car lags in comparison. The suspension is downright sloppy. Straight line acceleration is exhilirating, but the smile on your face quickly fades if you have to turn, as it is plagued by execissive body roll and lack of control in corners. Stereo is so-so, and seating, even with the p-3 option pdg which includes upgraded "body contour" seats, is still far below the support and comfort of a BMW. If the BMW 335 convertible were available, I would have bought it. But it is not so I will enjoy this car for my 3 yr lease term and then trade for the more comfortable and sure-footed BMW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned the car for 2 months and everything has been up to expectations. Drove it from NJ to FL and back, and it was quite comfortable. Very little wind/road noise for a 'sporty' car. The new 7- speed auto is ultra smooth and quick. The new BMW 335 may have better handling/acceleration, but the CLK looks better and is more luxurious inside and out.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a nice car, but the driving experience leaves much to be desired. The Harman Kardon stereo is mediocre at best. The steering wheel presets aggravatingly will not scan presets. The computer should be reset so you don't have to mash the gas pedal to the floor to get a downshift (and then when it comes, it is jerky and more power than you want in most instances). The seats do not have adjustable lumbar support. The nav is unduly complicated and slow and does not work very well. Compare this to a bmw 3 series and it gets blown away in terms of comfort, functionality, and performance--the only thing this car has going for it is that it Mercedes did a nice job with the exterior. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven many cars in my 72 years This is the least user friendly car I have ever owned. MB has too many engineers who are really playing games with car functions. They have made life complicated for no benefit. Dealing with some of the menus and subs is distracting and takes the drivers eyes away from the road. I can't advise anybody to buy this car and would actively discourage anybody from doing so. MB is not alone Simplicity is what is needed! It seems that this is the way many manufactures are going and it is a mistake One should not have to be an engineer or a computer scientist to understand the car. The operating handbook is poorly laid out. Why should the operation of lights be on 8 pages?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ease of lowering and raising top. Ability to adjust seats. Comfort of seats is excellent. Place for glasses is good.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My experience is only 1 month old, but if my initial response is any indication of the future, this is one fantastic vehicle. I have owned over 80 cars in a lifetime of ownership from BMW and Jag to Corvettes, Porsche etc.. My CLK 550 is one of, if not the best of the bunch out of the box! Very fast and very smooth. Handles incredibly well under all but ice and snow for which I have no experience whatsoever. It will stay in the garage for sure during these periods! Fit and finish is everything one can expect from a $60K vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gushing power and handling. Smells great as well!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Picked up my new black (not metallic) CLK550 two weeks ago. Just passed 1000 miles. My previous cars included 330i, 911 C2, Audi S4. Never have owned a Benz before. This Benz is incredible. The car is supremely solid and capable. The engine is a beast you simply can't miss experiencing. 391 lb-ft of torque without a turbo is so much acceleration you won't believe it. And I have owned some very quick cars. That engine sound! 7-speed paddle shifter is also wonderful. Requires some practice in making it do what you want when you want. Anything over 3000rpm is all you need. For the truly adolescent (like me), you will walk away from M3's and 911's quite nicely. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine. Transmission. IPod integration. Trunk is surprisingly large. Back seat is surprisingly large.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am amazed at the acceleration of the new CLK 550. The overall fit and finish is truly outstanding. The top goes down within 20 seconds and the sound proofing when it is up is very quiet. This is my first MB, I have been driving Audi's for the past six years, including the 4.2 A6. The acceleration of the MB leaves the Audi in the dust. I look for any excuse to take the car out for a spin. It has been an awesome driving experince.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great interior. Clean and classic. Wonderful engine, excellent muffler note, and love the convertible.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have put about 1600 miles on the car so far and love it. There are a few minor things to quible about, but overall this car is an absolute blast to drive. Faster then a stock M3 and a lot more comfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first MB but not my first driving experience. I have been chauffering my Mom in her S500s for years never dreaming I'd be shopping for a MB myself. Test drove the CLK550 and that was it! What a jewel. A real pleasure to find the combination of coupe and convertible with such style and pizzaz! It is perfect. Few things ever are. It sure suits my fancy and makes my day just a little brighter and more interesting. The one complaint I have aesthetically is the choice of rag tops. Whatever happened to that beautiful "buff" colored cloth. Black, Ash and Navy don't suit every one's taste!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The wrap feel when the top is down and the light, bright ceiling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just upgraded from 350 cab to the 550 cab. The engine on the 550 is amazing. Too bad the rest of the car lags in comparison. The suspension is downright sloppy. Straight line acceleration is exhilirating, but the smile on your face quickly fades if you have to turn, as it is plagued by execissive body roll and lack of control in corners. Stereo is so-so, and seating, even with the p-3 option pdg which includes upgraded "body contour" seats, is still far below the support and comfort of a BMW. If the BMW 335 convertible were available, I would have bought it. But it is not so I will enjoy this car for my 3 yr lease term and then trade for the more comfortable and sure-footed BMW.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior looks. This is a fine looking auto, better looking than any of its competitors. Engine performance is amazing. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned the car for 2 months and everything has been up to expectations. Drove it from NJ to FL and back, and it was quite comfortable. Very little wind/road noise for a 'sporty' car. The new 7- speed auto is ultra smooth and quick. The new BMW 335 may have better handling/acceleration, but the CLK looks better and is more luxurious inside and out.</TEXT>
