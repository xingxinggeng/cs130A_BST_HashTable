<TEXT>My 2007 X5 has been nothing but a nightmare and the worse vehicle I have ever owned. I've owned many new BMWs (3, 5, and two 7 series) but my X5 is a completely different experience. It is a loser, a huge disappointment in terms of quality control, problems, but the worse part is how BMW has handled the issue - which is VERY poorly. X5 was in for recurring service issues 2+ months in 1st 2 years for a series of false engine warning lights, Ele issues, rear hatch door problems, and cosmoline that drips onto glass/paint. No support from BMW. Had to retain attorney as BMW NA could care less. BMW NA Execs clearly more concerned with their stock options than long term customers. Bye bye BMW! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I need to preface this by stating that my previous car was a 2002 745i, so I can handle anything gremlins can throw at me. So those individuals complaining about a few service issues are just whiners to me. So let's get to the heart of this. This car is a beast: It growls and snarls with the ferocity of a caged dragon. It throws you back into your seat and gives you butterflies in your stomach yet acts with the utmost refinement when traffics forbids its potency. The way its sport mode flies through its rpm bandwidth is breathtaking. It does everything extraordinarily & nothing mediocre. Its technology is prolific so glitches are par for the course. Drive one; it is truly beauty and the beast.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Impeccable service, head-turning styling, racecar-like handling & acceleration, throaty V-8 growl that sounds like a Mustang, plethora of technological features, a sport mode that actually pins you in your seat - all with the practicality of an SUV. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Beware the 07 BMW x5 re-designed 3.0 model has major flaws with the transmission. BMW has admitted to the issue and does not have a fix therefore recalls have not been sent out. A $60k car should not have a major fault. The car runs sluggish especially going up hills - it has a hard time shifting into the correct gear. The X5 does not accelerate well from a stopped position and it feels as if it is going to stall before it recognizes you are trying to accelerate. In the past 2 months my car has been in for service 5x times for a week at a time. I have been in contact with BMW North America at this point. BEWARE. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am amazed at how good the X5 is. A completely different vehicle to the old shape and to my surprise (didn't think it was possible to better that one) much, much better too. The iDrive is a little tricky at first but it's child's play once you get the hang of it. I test drove the Audi Q7 before and it drove like a tank with noticeable gear changes. All-in-all this is a great 4x4. I would recommend it but then again mine was made in Germany.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great riding car. Great design. Terrible starting problems. Have had 4 random no start situation. Two in garage, but two out on roads where tow truck was needed. Car has been in shop 8 days with this problem and have not been able to find problem to date. Scary, as you don't know when it will not start. Am getting rid of car now and will buy a Lexus for dependability. I have been a BMW owner for last 20 years. They have over the teched the car. Was told it has over 50 computers in it. Problem is, how many work properly. Do not buy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned the X5 for only a year and twice now I encountered a parking brake malfunction. The first time this happened was on Thanksgiving day! Had to get the SUV towed from the gas station, manual hand brake feature would not work. Just today, just went to buy groceries and the parking brake malfunction went on again! Had to wait for tow truck for over 2hrs. No other options but to have SUV towed. Very inconvenient! And have to wait until Monday for dealership to open! Even more inconvenient! Other than this, had to change 2 tires twice due to nail punctures, run flats cannot be patched, spent over $1000! Changed one tire, SUV not even a month old! Not safe for long drives! DO NOT BUY!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first BMW and my last. At 55k one would expect greater reliability. The cabin has been filled with squeaks and rattles, even the headrest squeaks. The dashboard has been taken apart twice. Consistent major malfunctions, abs, awd, hill descent, cruise, have shut down (5) times in less than a year w/out warning. Running boards are useless makes it difficult for entering, exiting vehicle. The 3.0 lags at low speeds, always needing to shift into sport mode. The ride over uneven road surfaces is punishing. Steering is very stiff always need 2 hands at low speeds. No available option for a remote start due to the complex wiring. The quality, material of the sunvisors is poor, not even a place for sunglass</TEXT>

<TEXT>The X5 with the V8 has nice acceleration and a throaty growl. The ride is noticeably harsher than our MB GL450 and neither really exhibits excessive body roll. On worn highways I often try to drive to the side to get a smoother ride. I really regret getting the side aluminum running boards, they make it much more difficult to get in and out. While many reviews say the iDrive is easy to learn, I sure wish BMW would add more dedicated buttons. The GL450 is much easier to use to access the map, radio, etc.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a porsche CS for the X5. The X5 is perky but not as fast as the CS. The X5 is nicer to drive on long trips and has features like bluetooth & ipod. Tire wear should be better and cheaper. The iDrive is a breeze to use as is the voice command function, very cool. Great suv but do your own homework.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My loaded X5 has 14000 miles . Week 1, faulty oil line, spent 1 week at the dealer. 1 month later computer crash, 4 more days at the dealer. This month transmission failure ,1 more week at dealer. Now I am told that I need new tires for 2500.00. Yes the x5 is fun to drive and great looking but is not worth the price tag. Just bought my wife loaded 2007 MDX for 20000.00 less than the X5. It might not be the high performance machine but it has not been back to the dealer and it really has better options. Stay away from the X5. </TEXT>

<TEXT>For those new owners of a BMW X5 3.0si, there are several units with a problem with the A/C blower motor. If you have heard a grinding noise coming from the inside of the A/C vents, you have it! The part is in back order. If you haven't heard the noise, contact your dealer and ask if your car has the problem. Pray that your dealer is honest and will tell you the truth. Very, very frustrated with the brand. A $60K should be flawless. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th BMW X5 and the first one I am not in love with. The interior is noisy. The transmission does not seem as responsive as previous models. The sport seats are not comfortable. The iDrive is very buggy. Has been in the shop several times already. My previous X5s never saw the shop once except for an oil change. Will try to sell this one. Kind of disappointed since for the last 10 years every car I have owned has been a BMW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This new BMW X5 is a shocker. The SUV/SAV is so cheaply made on the interior that it buzzes and rattles over all roads. My 12-year old insisted that the back seats felt like sitting in the plastic bleachers at a school ball game. I like BMW and I'm shocked that this car ever left the test facility. It's all engine and suspension, and performs well, but the build quality is cheap. The leather seating surfaces are hard and felt like vinyl.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The navigation unit pales in comparison to that of Honda/Acura. The X5 is nimble, unmatched in its ability to handle quick turns. The acceleration is very good, considering the low gear takeoff. I found the steptronic transmission feature allows for smooth quick acceleration in M3 to M6. The transmission seems to work a little harder in M6 than in D6. I have 5100 miles on mine in 3 months. I really enjoy driving this SAV. The third row seat is only for kids under 5ft and under 120 ibs.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd X5, and was, I thought, a no brainer to purchase. Wrong! Part of my disappointment may come from the fact that my previous X5s were 4.0s This car feels underpowered and slow in many situations. The seats are very different from my old X5. I have yet to find a comfortable setting; have driven 10,000 miles so far. The X5 has changed its size slightly, but enough that it is difficult for a short person to enter. My runflat got a flat at 5,000 and they would not fix it, only replace it for $400+. Car has had some computer glitches; got towed away DEAD at 3,000; dealership never could figure it out. The info screen goes dead sometimes for no reason. Not a great BMW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has issues. Please be aware that i-drive software is buggy and still a work in process. Many of the features do not work. Stupid stuff like tilt steering, brightness on display, push buttons for radio stations. Biggest issue with this vehicle is the problems many are having with the transmission. High revving and thump upon slow down. Car will spend much time in the shop.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second BMW and my new X5 supports my previous statements about BMW being the best ownership I've ever had. This X5 does everything right. The computer controlled transmission operates exactly the same as if I was making the decisions myself. The X5 drives amazingly like the Porsche 911 I recently owned, probably because of the Sports Package and 20" wheels that I insisted on having. This SAV is as close to perfect as any of my previous vehicles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was so excited to get one of the first 4.8i's in production (November 2006) to the point that I never considered that the car would be anything but better than my old 2003 4.4. As of late April 2007 I'd take back my old 4.4 in a second. The new X5 is a pig. Much slower, less comfortable (the sport edition seats are incredibly uncomfortable)things like my cell phone can't charge when the car is off,and that unbelievibly annoying seat belt alarm (you can't put groceries on the passenger front seat as an example) makes really angry at BMW. And yes I will sell it shortly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Amazing handling, very responsive, particularly for it's size, feels smaller and lighter than it is. Interior design, very thoughtful and attractive. Bullet proof on ice and snow, Xdrive, sport package plus all the numerous electronic aids simply work. Over-engineered, takes much study and trial and error to use myiad systems. The iDrive is just plain tedious - flying the F16 was easier! Bottom line: if you like to drive, this is an easy choice over it's peers.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>BMW handling, just plain magic, a scalpel in a world of axes. Excellent power train. Rock solid in ice and snow. Gorgeous fit and finish, inside and out. Highway mileage, 20+ at 75-85, quite surprising, credit the new power train.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My 3rd & last BMW (two 7 series and this X5). With 1300 miles on my 4.8 X5 it had to be towed to shop while I was 800 miles from home when the electronic transmission would not shift. Computer updates were no help. As I write this from my motel room after 2 days of waiting, the factory folks are still scratching their heads. Other than the reliability issue the car is very rough riding. Wind noise is too pronounced for a luxury car selling at this price point. The ventilated seats are superior in overall comfort to the hard buckets which are standard. The runflat tires cost abt $500 each to replace and should be an option not standard! </TEXT>

<TEXT>After in-depth comparisons to Mercedes ML 320 CDI, ML500, Lexus GX 470 and Cadillac Escalade, the BMW X5 won me over quickly in a variety of areas from build and finish to actual ride, drive and handling. Most of the others offered spongy-swaying rides, not the X5. The V8 is a beast and the 6 cylinder is more than adequate and the mileage is much better. Certain option packages are well worth the cost like the Premium package, the Technology package, Sport package and definitely the Active Steering as well as the Comfort Assist. The Active Steering provides an incredible increased handling effect. And 4 yrs/50k mile bumper to bumper INCLUDING maintenance is sweet as well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>BMW has done an outstanding job with this redesign. The old and new X5 both perform well, but the new X5 adds REFINEMENT to the equation. Wind/road noise are hugely reduced. Interior quality is greatly improved. The sport package with active suspension hugs the road, yet gives very smooth ride quality with minimal lean in corners. Contour seats are excellent, although the active "massage" seats are a little weird (like having a python slowly undulate under the seat cushion). No squeaks, rattles. No defects. I tire of the computer-challenged press who constantly complain because they can't learn all iDrive features in a 10-minute test drive. I love the control it gives over vehicle functions.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth/quiet on highway with excellent handling. BMW's upgraded contour seats are the best seats in any car, period. Stiff chassis feels ultra solid. Heads up display with nav system. Well-placed cup holders, storage bins. Upgraded stereo, bluetooth phone.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought new 2007 X5 sight unseen. Ordered in October, picked up car in January. In gently rolling area the X5 3.0 seems underpowered. The transmission is constantly shifting and feels like it is straining. If you really put your foot on the gas, it's not as noticeable. Love the design, in fact am trading in for the X5 4.8. It's going to cost, but my mistake.</TEXT>

This car is smooth, confident, and looks beautiful! I test drove all the midsize type SUV such as the Acura MDX, Mercedez ML350, Audi Q7 and Porsche Cayenne.

<TEXT>This is one of the best handling SUVs (or SAV according to BMW) I've driven, equalled only by the new MDX. But what differentiates the X5 from the MDX are the tangible and intangible qualities of a BMW (handling, quiet cabin, solid build, "growl" of the engine, great styling and the looks you get on the street). We loaded the car up with lots of toys - let's hope it's as reliable as their airtight 4-yr maintenance program. The only areas of improvement are the unnecessarily complex iDrive and limited legroom in the 3rd row.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 5th X5 and it's a huge improvement over a vehicle that was already very good. It's quieter, smoother, more comfortable, handles better, has greatly improved interior convenience. The upgraded "contour" seats are outstanding. Sport package, technology package, premium sound system are worth the money. I'm one of the few who likes iDrive and this is the best one yet. I wish I had known that you can't see the heads-up display if you wear polarized sunglasses. Ventilated, massaging seats are probably not worth the cost. 3rd row seats add weight to the vehicle and will rarely be used unless you plan to haul elf-sized people or kids. Heads-up windshield display is not worth the money if you live in a sunny climate and wear polarized sunglasses. 350 hp is adequate, but it would be a much more exciting vehicle with an additional 30 - 40 hp. </TEXT>
