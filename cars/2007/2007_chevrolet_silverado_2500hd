<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle to tow a travel trailer which it did very well in the beginning. I dont have a lot of room so I'm going to list the parts that have been replaced on my truck at 50,000 miles.Front Locking Hubs,Pressure Relief valve,Rear end,Complete Engine with turbo,Turbo,Front axle, I paid $38000 for this truck and am now over $13000 deep in repairs the warranty would not cover the engine they said I drove through to deep of water and it sucked it into the intake from the bottom,bad investment on my part I guess these 4x4's arent supposed to leave the pavement.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought new to tow 5th wheel. 6.0 liter gas engine/auto tranny/cloth interior. Getting 14mpg around town (speeds range from 60mph to 30 mph, stop and go) Have not had an unladen trip on the highway yet so I don't know the mileage there but will by the end of July - I'm hoping for 18mpg. Paint is thin and scratches very easily - a big disappointment for me. Interior is dated; exterior is boxy, reliability has been good but I only have 6k on the the beast. Build quality is average. Ride is stiff even at 50psi in the tires. It does have power! Lookout boys, it's gonna unwind!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A fan of cloth interior. Gauges easy to see/read. Big interior (crew cab) </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I own a rare 2007 Silverado 2500 HD model, of which only 166 were made (and only 10 in my color red). It's registered with GM Vintage Vehicle Services, and I have the appropriate documentation. It's a 9200 lb gvw tank that can pull 12,900 lbs. It's a dream to drive and gets up to 32 mpg highway, although rated at 25 mpg. It's a dream to drive and I can go from Vancouver across B.C. through the mountains with only tapping the brakes 3 times due to automatic grade braking and auto-manual push button shifting. I have it in car shows all the time, yet its still a working truck used for trailering. I'm extremely happy with this awesome vehicle, which gets same fuel economy as my first new Toyota.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfort, power, good looks, great gas mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have now had my '07 duramax 2500HD for two years (see review under by name) Over 30,000 miles later, I am even more impressed with this truck. I have had exactly no major issues.... None! This is not what I had expected since it was an American made truck. This is our car of choice for long trips...it is so comfortable. Gas mileage seems to be getting a little better with diesel engine (around 19 to 21 on long trips, 16 to 18 in town). I would buy this truck all over again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this as a replacement for my 2001 crew cab duramax. I was a little worried about if it would be able to tow my 12000 lb trailer since it has the 6 liter gas engine. As it turned out it has no problem whatever towing it and the 6sp allison tranny is a joy. The mileage could be a little better but since regular gas is alot cheaper here than diesel it works out alright. I especially like the built in trailer braking system instead of having the aftermarket unit hanging under the dash. After 20000 miles I have not had a single problem with this truck . It is as tight and quiet as the day I bought it. I only use it for towing our 35 ft camper. Again love this truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Definitely the Allison 6sp Transmission</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great performance, have to check the mirrors to see if the car hauler is still behind me when I'm towing. Interior seems smaller than my '04 but still comfortable. A little too much bling with the chrome bumpers and the bulges in an attempt to make it look bigger than it really is. Had the front bumper painted black to match the body color. Looks a lot cleaner.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Allison tranny and the duramax. Effortless power with great mileage, 18 mpg on average, and when towing 13 to 14 mpg</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I get poor gas MPG with the 6L VORTEC V8 which should be bore tech because between the crappy shifting in the 6 spd trans always shifting drives me nuts and the 9.5 Miles per Gallon, with only a work box on it. Plus the suspension in can not hole the work box, Max payload is 3800 lbs. and the box alone weights that. Bad choice by me, and listening to the salesperson get rid of an old truck and not paying a little extra for what I really need. Bad part is I would loose over $8,000 dollars to sell it, Plus what it would cost to get a new one! Upgraded suspension cost installed, $3875! </TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2500HD rides so much better than a 1500, especially on long trips and going over the mountains. Pulling a car trailer with a 55 Chevy you don't even know it is back there. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>New grille design and the overall look of the truck. I love the Desert Brown metallic with the cashmere interior. A little different than the standard white, black or red trucks out there. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>For all of its power, heavy duty cargo and towing capacity, and rugged looks, its handling capabilities, ride, and interior make it a dream to drive and ride in. Chevy has done it! No longer the so-so looking truck on the road. Its body style makes this truck attractive to even the died-in-the-wool Dodge or Ford enthusiast such as I was prior to the 2007 Silverado HD truck I now own. I love the suspension, electronic 4- wheel drive shifter on the dash and towing capacity of the Vortec 8 cyl., six speed transmission. This truck does not even flinch a little when it is towing my 10,000 pound horse trailer with equipment and our horses. We live in Wyoming so it tows up and down hills.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great truck! It has, what seems like, unlimited power, pretty good gas mileage and outstanding creature comforts. The interior of the truck makes long drives easy; I wish I had this truck in college, it would have made the road trips even more exciting.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2007 Silverado because of the new design, and I needed a new truck. The truck is great, runs great, smooth, quiet, and has plenty of power. The only thing I don't like is the gas mileage, I have 2000 miles on my truck so far, and mostly highway driving and I can't get better than 11 mpg. all and all the truck is nice, but the fuel economy is not worth buying a truck like this.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just turn 6,000 miles on our 07 2500HD crew cab with Duramax diesel and we love this truck. We traded in our 04 1500 extended cab for this truck. We looked at the 07 2500 classic trucks, but glad we waited. Vast improvement inside & out, higher bed sides on outside, completely new interior inside, no more cheap plastic pieces. Thicker leather on seats, great new dash with radio that can mix memory between FM, AM & XM for each "FAV" setting. Towing is incredible, beats any gas engine, any size. You can barely tell you are towing, very comfortable, able to tow our trailer up Mammoth upgrade on 395 with cruise control on, passing all the sad little gas engines on the side of the road!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Redesigned interior, including black leather. Fit and finish is great, and nice upgrade on materials. Intergrated brake control. Duramax diesel, pulls our toyhauler & bikes (10,000+ lbs) w/ little effort & very quite. Easy flip up back seats w/ flat floor, leaves big interior space. Camping mirrors.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just put 6000 miles on our 07 2500HD crew cab with the Duramax diesel. We replaced our 2004 Silverado 1500 for towing our toy hauler, which is 10,000+ lbs when loaded with bikes. It tows with ease, very comfortable even up steep grades. Handeling is good, corners well too. The cabin is also much nicer, leather on seats is thicker than on our 04 truck. Overall interior fit and finish just as nice as any import. The trailering mirrors are great, much bigger than previous and with smaller miror on bottom. I can now actually see cars in blind spots. Overall we are very happy with our upgrade to the 2500 HD with Duramax diesel, just a great truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Black interior, new for Silverado, hides the interior wear and tear of being a truck pretty well. Trailering mirrors. Quite cabin, even with diesel much quieter than 07 gas truck. Radio memory channels that you can mix AM, FM & XM. Much less plastic on exterior, so easier to wax. Split back seat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just got this truck last week. Very comfortable to drive. Power is amazing, particularly off the line. Very quiet. Won't fit in the garage as it is too tall and long. A bit disappointed with the Bose sound system. Nice but certainly not audiophile quality. Nav system very user friendly. In new body style, they changed the passengers dome light from an airliner reading light to a more generic light. Result is that the light cannot be turned away from driver at night resulting in too much glare. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, interior, gotta get the Nav system, quiet, adjustable pedals. Seat fold up in back giving space from floor to ceiling</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After having two Z71 Suburbans, I gave in and purchased a truck that could pull my 30ft. RV and still be driver in the city. This is a great truck, quality is tops. I have almost 4000 miles and have not had any problems. I have also noticed that once the truck warms up, the mileage is not bad for a big gasoline engine. I have averaged 16 on the road and around 13 in town. Considering the size, power etc. this is not bad. The six speed transmission is great for pulling. My RV weighs in at about 7500lbs and you can't even tell it's there. I have driven in North Carolina pulling the trailer in the mountains with no issues. I haven't missed my Suburban. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first diesel and I am absolutely amazed at the quick response in acceleration. I've only put 1600 miles on it but average 15 mpg around town and just over 17 hwy. The interior is absolutely great. Instruments are easy to read and with the steering wheel controls, don't have to look around to do most of the common things done while driving (cruise control, radio station, volume). The dash information center is great, mileage avgerage, distance to go before refill. The added feature of integrated brake control for trailering is fantastic. The 180 degree rear doors are really great when loading goods or people in the back seat. Diesel is very quiet. You can actually talk while driving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>What an amazing truck. I have had it for a little over a month and put almost 3200 miles on it. New Duramax is incredible. Very little turbo lag. Everything about this truck is the way a truck should be. All the toys and finally a power rear slider integrated trailer brake rear parking assist. Navigation is easy to use and ride is actually improved</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The performance of the Duramax. Quick, responsive, and no push the pedal and wait. It's there always</FAVORITE>
