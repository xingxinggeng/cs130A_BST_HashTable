<TEXT>This car is awful. I feel so unsafe in this car plus it is so uncomfortable and I am very short. The car rattles and the mechanics can't find the problem. Gas mileage is not what they say it is. The tires that come with the car do not last. I would not recommend this car to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We drove 2 new Civic manual trans for 12 yrs each with no problems. As for the Fit: Wire harness recall. Starter motor replaced at 34,000 m. Broken front axle, and manual trans. replaced at 39,000. We've lived in the same place since 1984, same driving conditions, same avg. miles per yr. Fit's a relatively new model, and its reliability hasn't really been tested until now. We'll soon know if the car's Fit to be called a Honda.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I test drove the Fit, I listened for road noise/cabin noise because I drive quite a bit. I should have driven the car longer. The cabin noise is simply overwhelming at times. I will consider other tires to see if this helps, but the noise is so loud, it makes the car feel cheap and tinny. Don't get me wrong: I love this car - I just can't stand the amount of road noise I hear. And my wife doesn't like the stereo playing at full blast in order to drown it out!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The MPG is fantastic, but I mostly love the maneuverablity, handling, and ability to park just about anywhere.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I get 40 mpg on the hi-way! If it is cooler in the season and the a/c doesn't need to be on that little car is great. It will drop down to about 37 mpg hi-way with the a/c turned on. I'm planning on driving it up to NE Georiga next month, so the truth will be known on the mpg then, but It's great to fill it up on a meer 10.00 while others are laying out 20-50 dollar per fill up</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 3 years and 25k miles, I haven't had to change a thing, not even the windshield wiper rubber! It lives up to the Honda reputation. Ample room and flexible seat arrangements allows you to carry big or long items, saving the cost of buying a truck. Its headroom is larger than most SUV and midsize cars.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's all wrong ! The transmission setup is really awful. The gearing ratio into first gear and second result in a noticeable hesitation as the computer tries to match up with the short gear and the computer fuel delivery system. These tiny engine/trans crammed into a tiny space don't leave much room for clutch travel. Whereby we have a short time to ease the clutch out and get moving. The feel is not really smooth at all, and I have always enjoyed sticks. But in this car, get the auto and spare yourself the grief. This car even chatters backing up a hill. I am sorry I bought mine, it's very peppy and looks racy and cute, but I can't get comfortable with the transmission.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is fun to drive (in good weather) and gets great mileage, but beware of driving it in the rain or snow. It just doesn't handle snow and ice like all the other Hondas that I've owned since 1974. I actually had to have it towed once and the snow wasn't really that deep. Tires are expensive and hard to find. A big part of the money you save in gas goes towards maintenance and tires. $$$ I should have purchased a Civic.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Has been 1.5 years and still running well. I like its practicality, roomy interior and simple dash layout make it easy to control - too simple that it looks a bit dull. Good engine performance for its class, although the AC lacks it sometimes (good maintenance would be to minimize it). Having much trouble with its huge front pillar, making a blind spot when turning.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went from a Tundra to a Fit. The savings on gas alone is close to the monthly payment. Being able to fold the seats flat I have been able to fit everything that I have needed to. It is a surprisingly fun car to drive and I can fit the kids and enough stuff for a long weekend. Only complaint is a creaking sound from the dash.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is not good if you are planning to have children, you cant fit the stroller in the trunk with many grocery bags. The back seat is small and with the car seat you can only fit one adult. There is not much leg room for a tall man in the passenger seat, your knees hit the dash board. Unless you live where the roads are paved smooth this car isn't for you, if you go over a pebble it feels like you wrecked the car. I didn't know the tires didn't have locks, and some low life robbed all my alloy wheels and tires, cost 1,000. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned 5 Hondas over the last 10 years and may be a little bias, But Honda has done it again. At first I was turned off by the small engine & the kind of high price for its class. I decided to give it a chance and took one home for a test drive. Very impressed with power of little engine, however dont buy if speed is your thing. I bought a manual and have had no problems getting where I need to be and getting on the highway works great for the most part. Very impressed with build quility. solid car with great gas mileage. If good gas mileage and quilty are your thing then this car is best in its class. Only had car 2 weeks will make another input after 3 months.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a very fun car to drive. The acceleration is peppy and responsive. Handling is tight. The gas pedal is very "loose", even the lightest tap gives a response. A/C is not very powerful but gets the job done. The sound system is excellent. Cargo room is amazing. Head room up front is fantastic, there is no way I would hit my head getting in or out. The body is well put together, nothing feels or looks flimsy. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MP3/WMA feature on the stereo, auxiliary jack for MP3 players, cup holders on the doors, flat-folding seats (which sold me on it over similar models like the Matrix), bright colorful dashboard lights, quiet, comfy, roomy, love the color. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a great car - period. Honda has done an excellent job of reinventing the hatchback concept for the new millenium. Two roadtrips (ATL-DC and ATL-SC) so far and no complaints. Car is fairly quick, responsive and smooth, reminds me of a BMW to drive (except I'm getting 36 MPG at 80 MPH). In general, I favor European cars (BMWs, Mercs, VWs, etc) - but Honda has done an excellent job of integrating an intelligently-designed vehicle (great safety features, innovative cargo handling, excellent fuel economy) with outstanding road feel, handling and suspension.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>MPG - hands down. My search criteria during the shopping process was a minimum of 30 MPG. And as we were downsizing from a VW Eurovan the car had to manage cargo well. This Fit certainly does that!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had some fun cars in my life including a couple of bimmers and a 911SC, but this one takes the cake for pure fun. Like a horse on its way back to the stable, this car seems to be happy doing whatever it does. I bought it for its practicality (load capacity is great for a car with so small a footprint plus mid 30s fuel consumption), so the fun is a bonus. One problem, my wife loves it too, so we have to split it's duty while the Passat wagon stays home. She wants to sell the Passat and maybe put another Fit on the driveway. I won't argue.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The standard equipment, mechanical, safety and ride-handling characteristics rival the premium brands. Dual front, dual side, front-to-rear side curtain airbags, ABS, versatile seating arrangements (MagicSeat), and upscale interiors are wonderful even to the base Fit (I have the Sport AT trim). Paddle shifters in my Fit are awesome too, close to totally driving in manual without the stick-shifting and clutch. MP3 aux outlet is a nice bonus too. Buying the Fit is like buying years of fun, safety, security and total peace of mind. If you can stretch budget, go for the Sport trim MT or AT.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was really not even going to look at the fit but my mechanic encouraged me to. Well I'm pleasantly suprised. It's got the fuel economy for my weekday commute and lots of space for my weekend dogwalks and camping trips. It's got more zip than you would think but it's not the Civic and it does get chucked around a bit in high winds. Bad thing is there aren't many of them so there are no real good "deals" to be hand. But at the price you really can't got wrong.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having owned my Fit for 6+ months I do NOT and will NOT recommend it. IMHO Honda needs to start over. I have lots of issues with it. First is the Windshield wipers. WHY does that passenger wiper have to swing all the way into the drivers view? I feel this is a Safety Issue. However I guess Honda doesn't care. I could go on and on with all my gripes with the car. There are a few more that NEED to be mentioned. The Seats are not comfortable for long rides. The gas tank, making annoying sloshing noises. (For those that don't hear it I have to say HMMM...Are you DEAF?!?) Rear license plate holder allowing the plate to rattle. The paddle shifers on the steering wheel (boggles my mind WHY)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The color, I got the Metalic Blue AWESOME color, the 'Magic Seating' is pretty nice being able to haul bigger items... Which is probably what makes the seats so uncomfortable if one sits over an hour on them.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having owned an impressive list of performance cars I was not expecting much from the Fit in terms of performance but I was badly mistaken. This car is a blast. With a few aftermarket upgrades I made(suspension springs and lighter wheels) this car handles as well if not better than a Mini. The lack of horsepower is just not missed when you have such a wonderful chassis to play with. Gas mileage has been 38mpg on average. Build quality is excellent. Paint is good. No rattles to be heard. If you are a car enthusiast forced to "downgrade" for a while, this car is no downgrade!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car really feels much bigger than it really is. I was trying to drive it under 55 and it wasn't easy! The car responds and is very willing. 75 miles and the gas gauge has hardly moved. Should get better after break in! Took bumps very well. Didn't feel like the car was gonna shake apart! Got passed by some big rigs on route 80 on my way to upstate NY and the car held the road. I didn't feel small at all! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the layout of the interior. Everything is logical and within reach. Gauges look really cool a night! Great headlights. I live in the country and didn't have to use my highbeams. Seats are actually very comfortable. I am 5'10 and 215 pounds and I had plenty of room. Really great car! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The sport model with the larger wheels is so low you will hit concrete parking slabs and curbs. Since the front end slopes down, it is impossible to see or judge just where the front end is. Also I am getting much lower mileage-averaging 27 mpg if I coast a lot and never tromp on gas pedal and I use A/C at all times. The car is very nice looking with an exceptional interior and comfortable seats. The paint is very shiny but seems to scratch very easy or I didn't see the scratches when I bought it because it was sunny and car shiny. I wait to hit a pot hole or speed bump too fast and take off the sport attachment to the front bumper. Other than the above I really like the car and interior room.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride is what you would expect for a small car but the seats are very comfortable. The interior design is very attractive and the seats fold a number of ways so that the interior space can be used to suit your needs. The car is attractive. Safety features are excellent and just come on the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only put 1000 miles on my new Fit Sport manual, but I must say I love it. It handles like a dream. Nice, tight steering. The clutch and shifter throws are short and the acceleration is peppy. The stereo is loud and thumping and plays my my iPod tracks great through the auxiliary port. How many seating configurations does this thing have? There's room to tote my 6'4" self, my girlfriend and our baby, plus about a month's worth of groceries (if we wanted to buy that much, which we don't). Or, it can haul a household appliance. What's that you say, Mr. Salesman... delivery is extra? I think I'll pass. I traded down to this car from an Audi to save money and gas. No regrets.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Each time I drive away in my Fit, I feel I as though I'm privy to a best-kept secret. Who could want anything more than this li'l car offers? It has great pick-up on flat terrain, and the most standard features in its price range, not to mention the infamous Honda reliability. It holds a vast amount of cargo, and the mileage is far superior to any SUV. Who needs to spend $10k more-for what? You can drive away with no guilt, given that kind of savings, and you're making a better choice for the environment to boot. This car is responsive, fun to drive, and feels solid. Call me Zippy and guilt-free! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good pick-up on flat terrain. Great cargo capacity. Reliability, pricing, and safety crash ratings sold me! Spacious cabin. Interior lighting is neat. Decent sound system. Storm silver- good color. Seats higher off ground - easier access. Handy wide door swing too </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We love our new Honda Fit! After test driving both the manual and the automatic, the manual was the way to go! With a manual transmission, you get great control in the acceleration (we traded in our 1990 Acura with a V6 engine). It's quick and responsive and has a great u-turning radius. We can't wait to go on our road trip in August! We plan on driving this car for 20+ years too! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It has amazing cargo room and multiple seating and cargo configurations. We seated 3 people with 3 road bikes (two on a roof rack and one in the cargo area with 60-split back seat down). We also like the windshield wipers. Of course the gas mileage is great, even better than EPA highway ratings!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've been very pleased with my Honda Fit. It handles well and is quite peppy for a small car with an automatic. They truly did squeeze the maximum interior space with into the car. It has a good stereo/CD player as well. People are definitely interested in it. Folks ask if it's a hybrid I say "not quite but it does get 30-36 MPG". Six airbags and ABS as standard features is pretty decent in the safety category.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Fit Sport for a year and 13,000 miles later I still love it. This is the first time I've actually enjoyed driving a car. It's dependable, easy to park anywhere, comfortable for adults and children and I can put so much stuff in it. I also appreciate the fact that this car has many great safety features and an interior that's easy to clean which is important when carrying children. The Fit has redeemed my view of the powerless 4 cylinder car. It feels wonderful to drive a gas efficient car that overall looks and feel great inside and out. However, I suggest some minor tweaks related to noise and the interior.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having put 1200 miles on a Fit Sport, I find it meets the purpose for the purchase - fuel economy of 36-37 mpg! My driving is 70% hwy & 30% city. The little Fit is larger than my Civic, and offers more versatility. At 6'4" I look like a circus clown getting out, but I'm the one laughing at the gas pump. It's fun to drive, handles well and based on my comparision with other micro cars, seems to offer the best overall quality with regard to materials, ergonomics and handling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have 2000 miles on my Fit and like it all right. It doesn't have the handling, stability and gas mileage that my 94 and 96 civic HBs had. I've about had it with cars that you can't see where they begin or end from inside until you bang them against the curb. The front clearance is too low. But it gets decent mileage: 43 hwy mpg best thus far. The seats are not very comfortable. You ride low and feel every bump. Not so in my civic HB. Cabin is loud and the engine and trans buzz and rev a bit on the AT. The shifters are nifty in sport mode but trouble in D mode. Seems they should disengage in D mode.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Each time I drive away in my li'l Fit, I feel as though I'm in on a well-kept, wonderful secret! This tiny car delivers in every way. I researched a lot before purchasing and am so glad that I didn't spend 10k extra on the alternatives. No need. The interior is spacious with great flexibility. On level ground, pick-up is good though not so hot on hilly terrain. Large windows are nice, however interior heats up a LOT when parked. Cargo room is fantastic. This car is very zippy and loads of fun to drive. The price point makes it a real winner, especially given Honda's great reliability and safety crash ratings. The Fit is guilt-free, fun driving at its best! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for three months, 2100 miles so far. My concerns are the following: the engine revs when I step on the brakes (but not always). The brakes seem flimsy and just don't feel right. The paint job seems to be cheap. I'm noticing orange peel surface and there are spots, especially near the windshield, where the clear coat is worn off or never existed. I don't seem to get the gas mileage that I should be. I drive about 85% city and usually get about 31 mpg. I don't think I'll keep this car long and I worry about how it will look and run after 2 years. Don't get the chrome shifter knob. After three months it comes loose all the time and no longer lines up properly.</TEXT>

She is getting 30-35 with the Fit in the first 1,000 miles of driving. Very pleased so far. Versatile, fun to drive, economical, and (we hope) reliable. We are a "Honda Family" and also have a 2003 Accord (son at college), 2005 Civic (daughter), 2006 Accord (me), and now the Fit for my wife.

I am averaging 38-39 mpg with 70/30 hwy/city driving, air on all the time. Versatility is awesome. Love the storage. Auxiliary connection for iPod is great. I would save the money on an iPod connection and just charge your iPod before you leave home. It sounds perfect connected to the auxiliary connection. Got my car in 3 days, no wait time, lucky I guess. Extremely happy I bought this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been very pleased with my Honda Fit. My basic manual version gets 37 mpg regularly, which is about equal to the goverment estimates. It is the first car that I have had to come even close to the expected fuel economy. I am particularly pleased with the extremely low rolling resistance. It gives a sense of frugality and adds to the engines performance.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car is very responsive and hold the road well. It has much more of a sports feel to it than I had expected.

<TEXT>We bought this car to replace an '04 Scion xA that my wife loved. That car we gave to our daughter in grad school. When we went to the Scion dealer and discovered they are no longer making the xA, we went next door to the Honda dealer. 5-sp manuals are apparently hard to get, but he found one at a deal in the next state, and we got our's in a few days. It feels bigger, more substantial, quieter, and smoother at highway speeds than the xA, but it's not quite as fun to drive. It might be the standard 14" economy car tires--the Scion has 16" standard--thinking of getting 15" tires and alloys. It's certainly quick enough with the 5 sp manual.</TEXT>

It's much quicker than many other 4cyl cars I've owned in the past. Sure, my wife's 225hp V6 Jeep blows it away, but then again, the Jeep maxes at about 21mpg on the highway.

<TEXT>The Fit is so much fun to drive I can hardly wait for an excuse to use it. The 5 speed is a joy to use. Space inside is well beyond what you should expect by looking at the outside. The rear seat system makes it great for all my hauling needs. My first few tanks got between 37 and 39 mpg. My last tank got me 47.7. I am thrilled with that. I found a Scangauge very useful in getting the best mpg. The ride is sporty and the engine pulls well from bottom to top rpms.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive and great mileage. The rear folding seats make amazing space. The engine has a nice power band. Quiet ride is nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having previously owned six Hondas, three CRXs, one Civic hatchbach and an Integra, I'm not new to the Honda family. The interior of this car is really well done. I love the options that you have with the seating. The feeling of the steering wheel is great and the gauge cluster is beautiful. Well I do have a few gripes with the car. I only average around 30 mpg with this car and I have a very light foot. The road noise is excessive. I might be the only one but the stereo is ok at best. Also I don't like the placement of the paddle shifter at least the way they follow the steering wheel when you turn. But for the price it is a very well equipped car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have put over 10000 miles on this car. My prime reasons for purchasing this car was safety reasons and mileage in an economic package. I get an average of 38 miles / gallon. My best results was a staggering 49 m/g traveling @ 65 m/h with the worst at 32. I am pleased with the functionality. My teenage boys like to drive it, but do not want to sit in the back. The younger kids don't mind. The car has a lot of room, a good sound package. The engine can be a little noisy at higher rpm. The advantage of the VTEC engine can be felt if driving alone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I waited 10 months to get my Fit with a 5 spd. Honda has decided to make almost 90% automatic. It was worth the wait, though. I love the car. It is a perfect replacement for my '90 Civic wagon. I've noticed a lot of folks complaining about the interior noise. They don't realize this car will be noiser than a sedan with a trunk! Compared to my '90 wagon this car is very quiet and huge. I love how it drives. I love the neat layout and all the amenities are a sheer pleasure.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought a new base line Honda Fit several monthes back and absolutely loved the car. Last week my wife was driving home when another car hydroplaned and crossed the median. She hit the side of this car at 60 mph. Our Fit was totaled but my wife walked away with just bruising from the airbag and seatbelt. The other driver had to be cut out of the car and spent several days in the hospital. The front of our Fit was destroyed but the internal integrity of the cabin was never compromised. We have a new Fit on order and would recommend this car to anyone. We primarily use it for cummuting in Denver and were averaging 40 mpg for our base model 5 speed manual transmission.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I initially began my search for a car with proven gas mileage and performance for its size. I initially looked at the Yaris, in this category. It had poor visability for a man my size. And most importantly, it lacked the standard safety features the Fit has. (ABS and Side-curtain air bags) I am very happy with the Fit overall. And it comes from a world-class automobile company like Honda. Renowned for reliabilty. This would be my first Honda. I normally consider no less than a Toyota.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Style. The innovative head lights are unique and the space in it was well engineered, in making the best of it. It is a great car for the money. It has no problem achieving the revised EPA ratings. I just love the idea that I can drive as far the big SUV, next to me in traffic, on about 1/3 the gas.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Honda Fit is getting hard to find in the Michigan area and I was so sure from the reviews that I wanted one that I purchased one without having seen one. When it arrived the next day from a dealer in the next state I was even more impressed than I had expected. I tend to judge a car in part at least by the sound of the door closing. A cheap car usually goes clunk but the Honda Fit sounds more like my Audi A6 and has a very satisfying sound that, to me at least, signifies good engineering. I'm just a little miffed about the lack of an iPod connection since it would have added about $0.50 to the price of the car and they gave one to the Canadian models. I'll find a way to add one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy - innovative use of space - nice engine compartment - lots of features in the base model - nice visibility - peppy engine - great steering - great tachometer - nice looking interior - lots of luggage space - good headlights - brakes seem fine - I love the red, white and blue instruments.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned the 2007 Fit Sport automatic now for two months, and am settling in nicely to the small car experience. My goal was to purchase a high mileage car for my 62 mile per day commute, one that was both comfortable and possessed an element of forward thinking design. I believe the Fit accomplishes that nicely. I was in that category of Americans who didn't want to give up their spacious minivan or SUV for something little and dangerous, but I knew that the time was coming to get on the conservation bandwagon. I researched sub-compacts for over a year, finally settling on the Fit. Initially it seemed startling to be zipping down the highway in my bright orange sweetie, but all is well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The CD player, nice head room, visibility, cuteness factor of the exterior, roominess of the cargo area, happiness at the gas pump when in Oregon fuel is $3.44 a gallon (and I'm getting 40-42 mpg hwy!), how I feel safe with all of the air bags, and just generally fun to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I think this is a great car. I got a Thule fit kit right after I got it so I can haul bikes. Can carry 3 bikes on top and 4 people inside comfortably. Has enough power in mountains even with 3 bikes on top, but just barely. Few issues I have are with the low carrying capacity. Also, no interior lock switch reachable from hatch. Illuminated interior makes it difficult to realize you don't have lights on at night. Magic seats are amazingly useful. I actually do use all the modes quite frequently.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove a Hyundai for 20 years and this is my first Honda. I have owned this FIT for three weeks and have 1500 highway miles on it. The gas mileage, which I am very thrilled with is between 36-40 mpg. Acceleration is great and this car corners very well with very responsive steering.I commute 53 miles each way to work and the cruise is wonderful. Air conditioner cools very well. The suspension is a little rough especially in work zones where the road is on the berm, and the noise in the cabin is a little louder than I was used to with my Hyundai. Driving at 65mph with the front windows partially down caused the front end to bounce up and down quickly..scary.. Cheap carpets. no arm rest.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage is terrific. Responsive acceleration and steering, plus corners great. I feel like I am driving a sports car. Open window plan, and roomy cabin. Magic seats have already come in handy. I do really enjoy this car, inspite of the few flaws I see. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first real trip in wifey's new Storm Silver Fit sport automatic was a combination of surface streets during afternoon rush with high speed expressway on the return trip. Total ride was 140 miles in one sitting. My car is an Audi A6 3.2 Quatro. This Fit Sport is as quiet and rattle free, CD player is nearly as nice. Interior is completely acceptable, build quality as nice, paint is quite good. The car handles bad roads and X-way ramps better than the Audi. What's wrong? The accelerator pedal is uncomfortable to work at low speeds and the engine needs better mounts or engine balance shafts. It is buzzy when it's working hard. That's pretty often. Sunroof please?</TEXT>

<TEXT>After our last car died, we wanted a fun, safe, fuel efficient, commuter, for grocery hauling that handled well, and will last 200,000miles without fear. We researched and test drove several other cars (Yaris, Mazada 3i, Versa and Focus). None could combine all the features the Fit provides. The most difficult part was finding a 5MT Sport Fit that wasn't marked up $3k over MSRP. Thankfully a little patience paid off. The auto-paddle shifters seem to drain a lot of life out of the little engine, thus purchsing the MT. Overall, this is a great little car! I do not believe we could have found a better Fit for our lifestyle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Zippy for 109hp, very well tuned suspension. Excellent use of space. Fit and finish is top notch. Mileage has averaged 36 with mostly 65-68 mph freeway driving. For a short wheelbase, the Fit is confident on the freeway.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I expected more from this car. I've had it for about 9 months, engine has to be broken in by now but the mileage is terrible. Barely get 400km on a tank and thats 50/50 city, hiway. I don't drive that hard either. My friends with domestic v6's get something close to that. It is fun to drive, kind've like a go-cart but because of all the little things, I'm considering trading it in for something else. The auto tranny doesn't work for this underpowered engine either, there's too much downshifting going on at the slightest hint of throttle. I wish I did more research rather than be blinded by the fact that it was a new Honda. BTW the orange colour doesn't work too well for this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car! After researching for a year and having to deal with an unreliable BMW this car is terrific. The quality of build is great, handles well in the mountains, ice, snow, and rain. On rougher roads it is quite noisy in the cabin but quiets on smoother surfaces, could use some insulating material to dampen the noise. I opted for the all weather mats and cargo tray which are very helpful having a dirt/gravel driveway, they are very easy to clean. The heater works well, have yet to fully try the A/C in hot weather. Great versatility in seat designs, went to the store and brought home 2 boxed shelf units and 2 adirondack chairs with a few bags and groceries also!</TEXT>

Great car for the money. Interior layout with the "magic seats" are just that-magic!

<TEXT>After a lot of research and thought, I traded in my 2005 Subaru Baja for a leaner gas minded Honda Fit. The interior is actually roomier and the ride is just as smooth. The noise factor, however, is a disappointment in that the Fit has a loud engine and is not as quiet in terms of outside noise. I love the paddle shifters on my sport model, as well as the rear wiper, fantastic stereo system, easy to use and reach controls, bright dash lights and open window plan allowing lots of light. The controls are solid and feel expensive. No problems with acceleration or high speed. So far, it has handled well in the snow and rain, which was a big concern for me living in Upstate NY and giving up the AWD.</TEXT>

No problems at all - no squeaks, rattles, troubles of any sort. It's very solid on the highway, even at 80 mph and heavy traffic. Gas mileage overall, 70% suburban commute and 30% Interstate, is right at 31 mpg. That's about 28-29 in town and 37 highway - I have a rather heavy foot. Lots of room inside - my coworkers always want to go to lunch in my car because it seats 4 large adults quite comfortably.

<TEXT>Ratings are in the context of an economy car. Extremely fun to drive (90% of Cooper level fun), but you get the utility of a much larger car. Gas milage is very good, but not great (~32 mpg city in winter). I'm hoping for the high thirtes on the freeway in the summer. I test drove vs. Yaris and Versa, and MUCH preferred this over either. If you value comfort over handling and can live with less gas milage, you may want to consider the Versa - it's a bit cushier but much less fun to drive IMO. Cost is a bit higher than the others, but ABS, airbags, etc are all standard here. If comparably equipped, the competitors lose their pricing advantage..</TEXT>

<TEXT>I put 1400 miles on it in 3 months. So far I am very happy with it. Compared with other subcompacts and compact cars, Fit is very quiet and stable. The engine buzzes when its speed hits 80 mph and above, instead of 75 mph, as reported by Edmunds editors. I am comfortable with that since I seldom drive faster than 75. I found it runs very stable and well under my control even at 85 mph. Many compacts might be like floating in the air when you hit this speed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Since everyone else has been raving about this car, i decided to check it out. The space and functionality were nice, but it was the suspension that really set it apart. Before this I had driven a Yaris and a Versa, and they both handled like a 90's SUV (the Yaris in particular felt like the Bronco II). I was therefore pleasantly surprised that this car's steering wheel was actually hooked up to something. This thing can corner like no one's buisness. Its fun to drive factor is off the chart, and i got it fully loaded for under 16 k. In typical honda fasion, it beats just about everything on the road, but just isn't racy enough to inspire anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving this vehicle for almost a year, as of this review - 2-21-07, I have a few minor complaints. 
1. The display for the radio unit does not show very well on a bright day. This appears to be a non-standard size unit. I would replace it if I could buy a off the shelf unit and just plug it in without a custom adapter kit. Honda needs to change this design. 
2. The top of the windshield needs to be better tinted or make the windshield smaller. Both the driver and the passenger have to use the sun shade to keep out excessive sun light even when not driving into the sun. 
3. The head lights seems to be aimed too low. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive ~90% city driving and just hit 31 mpg w/ 3000 miles on the odometer. Still no highway data, but mpg is still improving. Keeping the speed under 70 makes a huge difference in mpg. Great shifting w/ paddles and terrific handling. Interior design is excellent and w/ magic seats, I fit my 6'11" surfboard inside. Lack of dead pedal and center armrest was solved by buying after market from Zeta Products. Added Clear Bra and tinting to prevent chips and help the weak A/C. Relatively poor driving position and Honda needs to add telescoping steering column. Great car for the money and while inexpensive, the Honda Fit is in no way cheap. As basic transportation, it's a good buy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My first car was a 90 Civic hatchback, so it's been interesting comparing the similarities and differences. Much easier to enter/exit, more useable space, much more power (even with auto). Having a small child, the rear seat height and tall roof make it relatively easy to put him in and out of the car seat. Took looong roadtrip with my wife and child and enjoyed the comfort of "relax mode" even with the trunk full of stuff. Great highway mileage (37-40), but city mileage has been lackluster for such a small car (23-26). So far, that has been my biggest gripe. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This Honda Fit has turned out to be a very reliable car. I have driven it for roughly four months, and the car runs like a dream. It's also a very good gas sipper, and I only have to fill up its tank roughly every 10 days. Not only it's a good little subcompact for someone who just wants an inexpensive thing to commute in, it's also a cute car. I get compliments on its looks from time to time. Overall, it's been a very good car, and I highly recommend it to a routine commuter who wants something that's economical and yet appealing to the eye. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really appreciate the looks of the interior and exterior of the car. I like the way the dashboard has been laid out, and I especially love the color of my car, this vivid blue pearl. I also like the design--the 4 doors and the hatchback trunk and the "magic seats" are very handy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my fit because I was working in AZ and living in CA. With the current cost of gas I needed something with good gas mileage. I can travel from Redlands CA to Lake havasu AZ and only use 5gallons of gas doing 70mph the whole way!!! The car handdles really good up in the mountains, and on the freeways. I feel that it is a little under-powered going up and down the hill but then again its only a 4cyl. Im glad that I bought my FIT I wont sale it for anything. Its priced well and will save you a lot of money at the pump for sure.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>If you get the "sport" edition like I did you will love the paddle shifters on the steering wheel!! Its like your driving an indy car. I also like the hatch-back design with how the back seats fold down and you can put a lot of thins in the back.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have just gotten past the break in period and love the car even more than I anticipated. It really does feel like a '93 CRX. The interior is beautiful and, except for a temperature gauge, seems well equipped for a basic level vehicle. I haven't taken any advantage of the seat configurations yet,the dog is always in the back seat, but the seats are comfortable and well made. I also tested a Yaris. I must admit that the Yaris has a sharper exterior design but the FIT is far nicer on the inside and much more fun to drive. My first calculated fuel tank got me 35 miles/US gallon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a Sport MT in June. I live near Cripple Creek Colorado and drive to the Springs.(104Mi, 2 Hr) I average 42 MPG. Power up the pass is adequate.I recently drove to Georgia and found that when I exceeded 65 mph my mileage dropped to 35 to 38. At lower altitude it was noticibly more powerful. Wind and large trucks did not seem to effect it.The radio is great. It looks small but is roomy inside and a hoot to drive. Handling is a little stiff but sure. It's not intended to be a luxury car. My first snow experience tested the highway treads standard on this car. I will change them before next winter. Fit and finish is beautiful. Ride is quiet with room to haul all your stuff.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>What a deal for $15700. The dash is bright and easy to read. The stereo is great. Handling is like a sports car. Seating is such that you don't crawl out of it. Nice for ladies and older folks. Headlights/driving lights are great out in the country.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My first brand new car - have normally driven v6s or v8s. Took time to get used to v4 engine, but once you figure it out, that's when the fun begins. It turns on a dime and the versatility of cargo space is incredible. I moved a friend with just my fit--she couldn't believe this little car that could!! Agree that the two back headrests cause blind spot and would have liked a moon or sun roof option but all in all, it's your best bang for the buck!! Not to mention the side curtain airbags and sound system which is pretty good for standard. Love my car and love the mileage!!</TEXT>

This car exceeds all my expectations and makes me wonder why so many others are paying so much more to get less value than I have with my Fit. It may be small but it doesn't look or feel like a low priced car. I'm proud to own and drive my Honda Fit!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Fit is truly an excellent vehicle, and suberbly "fits" the role it is expected to do. It has a surprising amount of room in the vehicle, and with the back seats folded down, it can accept an amazing amount of cargo. Performance is also a big plus, with strong acceleration on freeway entrance ramps and for passing. Gasoline mileage is also very good. On a recent tank, with about 50% highway and 50% city driving, I got about 36 MPG. Driving at reasonable highway speeds will yield about 40+ MPG. Handling is also excellent, reminding me of my old Honda CRX Si. All of the above, coupled with comfortable seats, make the Fit a fun car to drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got a great price by shopping on- line. I bought the Honda Fit because I took a new job that has a commute of 200 miles per day. The commute is mostly highway and I average 36 MPG when adhering to the posted speed limit. When I go with the flow of traffic, I average 30 MPG. Responsive steering, smooth ride for a small car, interior roominess, a (standard) good sound system., great gas mileage and overall reliability are the reasons I bought this car. The only negative is the unimpressive paddle shifters on the steering wheel which can be accidentally activated with an errant finger movement, and they are functionally limited. They should remove them for their 2008 model. </TEXT>

<TEXT>In its class segment, nothing beats the Honda Fit. This car has comfort, performance, fuel economy, and awesome utility all built into one car. Handling is spectacular for its class, but acceleration is about average although it has good kick off the line. Utility is beyond description. The seats in the Fit are able to be configured for nearly any cargo load and the different seat configurations are a snap to put in place. The front seats have a slider lever on the seatback so that you don't have to hunch over to move the seat forward. The only gimmicky part of the car is the paddle shifters in the S model I have. They are not as easy to operate as one would think.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Hi, it's been 1 month since I submit my first review. I put 1600 miles on it. It's very smooth and you'd be more than happy with its power as long as you are not a racing car driver. Still in break-in, its highway mileage already hit what is listed. I got 46 this afternoon! (of course, air-con was off, and I used N for a couple of times:-) I love the ease to pull it out from parking lots because it doesn't have a sedan trunk! The ride is quiet but is not as comfortable as a mid-size sedan. You shall avoid Fit if you require a soft, comfortable ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I waited 3 months for a vivid blue 5 speed, and I'm glad I did. I love the color and I can't stop looking at it. I've driven almost 1000 mile in the first 2 weeks and I love the handling and great gas mileage (36 MPG on 2nd tank with mix of hwy and city). The only way to go in this vehicle is a manual transmission and it is so much fun to drive. I had a 96 Honda Civic Hatchback before this and the fit is much more quiet on the highway. For such a small car there is so much space for everybody to "fit" comfortably in the back seat. I look forward to having this vehicle for a long time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Vroom vroom baby!!! This little car has a lot of "get up and go" as my mother put it and it is soooo much fun to drive. I picked up a queen size, four post bed frame last week with ease all because of the 40/60 flip down back seating area. Also, the seats flip up for a different kind of space. I use that feature on a daily basis so my dogs don't get the seat furry. All my friends are jealous of my seemingly "never empty" gas tank because I get such great gas mileage. Oh and the color!

As a matter of fact driving my Fit in Chicago is (dare I say it?) almost fun. The utility in this car is amazing. I've had a lawn mower, a weed wacker (both Hondas), 8 bags of mulch and fertilizer and all sorts of small plants in the back. All delivered in one trip. Who needs an SUV?</TEXT>

<TEXT>We had to unexpectedly buy a new car when our Chevy Malibu developed fatal issues. The Fit was on my short list of replacements. I found one certified preowned and jumped on it. It is easily the best, most enjoyable car I've ever owned. The interior room is nothing short of amazing. I'm 6'2", so whether I can fit into a car is a big concern for me. The Fit is a little snug, but not uncomfortable in the least. It literally zips around like a big go-kart; the power from such a small engine was a pleasant surprise. I'm still on my first tank of gas, but so far it appears to be getting around 40 MPG highway. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my Storm Silver Fit Sport 5 speed manual on April 21, 2006. I purchased the car as it was being unloaded from the delivery truck. I have driven 8000 miles in the 5 months I have owned this car. Have had no mechanical problems. The only real "problem" I have had is with the windshield wipers. The wipers have been changed twice by the dealer & both sets "jump" accross the windshield when I use them. I plan on having them changed again. A few things I don't like about the Fit are: 1. The car could use another 15-20 horse power & as much more torque. 2. No center console.3. No sunroof. 4. Configuring seats into "lounge mode" could be easier. 5. Rear seat head rest could be smaller</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Honda Fit Sport automatic just over a month. The gas mileage the first three tanks, all 75-80% city driving: 24.6, 23.7, 24.7 mpg, less than I had hoped for. In every other way, it has been terrific. The braking, steering, and acceleration from a city stop are all very sensitive and responsive. I had the goal of purchasing a safe, reliable, economical, environmentally friendly (qualifies as LEV) fun-to-drive and not exorbitantly expensive vehicle. I feel like that's what I have. I test drove Yaris, Versa, Mazda3 and researched many others. For the best price, I went about 75 miles out of Los Angeles after extensively contacting Honda dealers' internet sales folks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the fit as a commuter, It is the most fun car in the economy class. Makes a boring 20 mile commute a little more bearable. Great Interior room, (my truck sits idle now that my fit will carry all but the largest and dirtiest stuff). Decently built for the price and tons of safety features for the kids and myself. Looks like a smaller Matrix, Not a goofy echo or yaris</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our family is really enjoying the Fit. Our small family of three and our full size dog "Fit" perfectly. Great amount of space and our gas mileage is around 38 mpg. I do alot of highway driving. Some things I would add to the base model. Cruise control, can't believe it isnt available. Center armrest. We have had no trouble with the car and would recommend it to anyone looking for a small car with great versatility.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Read about how great the handling, space utilization and build quality in this car before I bought it. Was concerned about acceleration and design/features being dated. Car has met or exceeded my expectations in everything, is fun to drive, and I would recommend it to others looking for a good car in this price range. Also own a 2006 Civic which is a more recent design and wish some of the features (steering wheel radio controls, better road vibration isolation, sunroof, ULEV engine, better dash layout, and better soundproofing) were incorporated into the FIT. Overall, the Fit is a fine car and I have no regrets on my purchase.</TEXT>

It handles like a dream and has enough get-up-and-go to excite most people (in spite of having a mere 109 horsies under the hood). Fabulous purchase for the the money--I was able to purchase an economy car without feeling like I was sacrificing. My boyfriend and I also own a Toyota RAV4 and have actually been quibbling about who gets to drive the Fit. It's suprisingly spacious.

<TEXT>We have owned our black Fit (automatic) for 2 months and love to drive it. However, our gas milage (mostly around town) is only 26.5-28.6 MPG, much lower than we expected. The a/c is anemic as well. We were in a limited time frame to buy and ended up paying $1000 over the sticker price for the only Fit in our area. I'd love to see this in a hybrid, minus the dealer bribe and that would be much closer to perfect!</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a great car this has been. 15K miles and it has been a charm on the city and believe it or not awesome on the Highway (granted that is a revvy engine). It's so fun to drive and what is a driving experience without the Fun?. Once you get on the High Revs during Highway it is amazing how stronger it feels right there past the 5K revs! and you feel so secure and planted to the ground that you even think you're going much slower! Now, that's impressive for a lil' car. I almost forgot, ah the Interior Space. All My friends can not believe how spacious it is inside.

<TEXT>I got my fit because my old car, a 96 nissan maxima, had all but bit the dust. The second it rolled off the truck and I sat down in it (I bought it pretty much sight unseen :-/) I imediately fell in love! Its a beautiful car! At 6'2", I still have about 3 inches of headroom, thats more than I had with my 'luxury' automobile. Another thing I had missed was cupholders. This has one for every passenger! Horray! But seriously, this is a blast to drive. Very peppy and the paddle shifters make driving low-rev to save gas a breeze! My coworkers had been making fun of me as I was waiting for devlivery about how small it is and such (theyre all huge truck drivers)but they saw it, that stopped.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fit Sport MT, 250 miles. Initial impressions: 'Wow' Super nice build quality and interior materials. Classy instrumentation. Smart handling. Fit doesn't know it is not a sports car! Very precise electronic steering and 'by-wire' throttle control. Fun and spirited drive with relatively firm suspension. Great headroom and leg room for a car this size (how did Honda do that). More headroom than Civic, Accord, and CRV. Fit Sport Audio has impressive audio quality; only one CD slot but with iPod Music Link, access hundreds of tunes. Seating for four is comfortable. Magic seat arrangements and hatch make this car seem like an Odyssey Mini. Nothing but fun. Due to break in gas mileage TBD.</TEXT>

Living in Orlando, parking is a premium at some locations, but the Fit fits anywhere! Economy was my initial goal during purchase, but I've been pleasantly surprised with the "Zip," this car has, especially in city traffic.

<TEXT>I recently sold my 2005 CRV since my wife and I had 2 SUVs, and we decided to downsize to 1 SUV (and be a little bit economical) so we went with the Fit.Prior to the CRV I had a 1999 Mazda Miata which handled incredibly.I test drove the Nissan Versa, since we wanted a compact 4 door, but in the meantime I had a deposit on the Fit.So it was between the Versa(drove nice also)and the Fit.My wife was impressed by the size of the interior of the Fit, which she noted that it did not feel much smaller than the CRV, deceptive interior size. The steering and feel on the road reminded me of being in the Miata, however with much more interior room.I know why the dealers can't keep them on their lots.</TEXT>

In addition, my father-in-law is 6'4" and can sit anywhere in the car comfortably.

<TEXT>So far 1126 miles, the fit has lived up to its advertising. I was loading boxes into the back of my Jeep Grand Cherokee and they would not fit so I borrowed my wife's fit and they all went in the back with the rear seat in the up position. The only fault I can find is with the driver's seat back for my legs to stretch (5'9") my arms are to darn short to reach the steering wheel comfortably. My 5'3" wife finds it perfect. The sport has a high quality sound system and the vehicle is quiet enough at highway speeds to listen to classical music. Handling is superb and you can do 80 mph and not know it.

I wanted an xB badly, but for the price the Fit had everything I wanted and needed, plus had higher NHTSA safety ratings than the Yaris and xB (my other two choices). We test drove a Toyota Yaris, but found it to be claustrophobic, less functional (space-wise), and cheaper feeling on the inside. After a test drive of a base model AT Fit, we were sold! The cornering and handling of the Fit is amazing, and it really drives like a little go-kart. It has minor issues, but every car does, especially in this segment. =)</TEXT>

<TEXT>Me? No. So if you're one of those peeps, this car's not for you. It looks like a very popular hybrid, but so much better and more budget conscious! Living in TX, I have to compete with a lot of V8 and V10 trucks (no, not horses). I am proud to say this little fuel efficient wonder zips through a sea of gas-guzzlers in a world of urban sprawl; and I'm a manual-tranny-drivin'-leadfoot! More features come standard with the FIT than any of its competitors: ABS, airbags, CD player, auto-locks, auto- windows and A/C! First tune-up? 100,000!

I drive as much on the freeway with 75 mph speed limit as I do in small towns at 35 and am pleased with performance of both. Not as comfortable as my Odyssey EXL van, but not as costly either and I am not tired after a long day of driving so it is fine.

<TEXT>Driving this car around, you would never think it was underpowered with the 1.5L engine. I bought this car based on the purpose of commuting 160 miles a day in the near future. After taking a small roadtrip, I got 36 mpg highway and A/C running almost all the time. You might of read reviews of the car not having an arm rest, but I've really hardly noticed it missing. One of my favorite features is the AUX input for the stereo for my Sony MP3 player. While others say the suspension is firm, I believe that it's perfect for a daily driver. The 5 speed transmission shifts smooth and accurate. I highly recommend the Fit for those that need an affordable car with just the right amenities.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a domestic car salesman. I drive a Fit! This car is an absolute hoot! Tons of room (I am a 250 lb man), very nimble, very versatile. If I sold them I would be wealthy! Problem being, Honda cannot build enough. I love this thing and plan to keep it a good long time!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the Fit. It is fun to drive, gets great gas mileage, is very stylish and is the most versatile vehicle in its class by far. Having the side curtain airbags standard is another added bonus. I have no major issues with this car and with Honda quality hope to drive it for 200k miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely love this car, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a small ride that doesn't feel cramped or cheap. I'm 5'10, and I Fit just fine in the front seat, with room to spare. The lack of the dead pedal and center armrest? No big deal to me, as I lived without these things in my last car (Ford Escort). I wish my car was getting better MPGs (it's barely breaking 30 each week), but I will say that the MPGs improve everytime I fill her up. I also wish she was a bit more powerful and had a few more "advanced" features (and that she was a bit cheaper, considering the lack of some of these features), but those are minor quibbles, as I adore this car and I'm so happy I bought it. :)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really like the sound system, the versatility of cargo space, the roomy interior, the "fun to drive" factor, and the unique look of the car, both inside and out. The gas mileage, while not as good as expected, is still pretty good, especially on long highway trips (that's when she's at her best).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>i just purchased the Fit. WOW this car has some pep to it. From 0-40 it's pretty quick but then after that it slow down a little. Can feel the bumps in the car a LOT. Car feels really light, no dead pedal and even when you leave your leg up there is a little bump right in front of the seat it feels a little uncomfortable. Other that that the car is great. Love the inside and out.</TEXT>

<TEXT> Acceleration onto a highway or passing requires some thought. The Auto could end up being deadly slow. The paddle shifters cannot be used when there is any angle on the steering wheel. Because it is an economy car there are compromises. The carpeting is about 2 steps above roofing felt paper. With a little more HP and torque this car would be an absolute hoot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Nice kick when starting out. Fun to drive and is rather nifty. But after the initial kick and going up any sort of slope, the engine kicks in pretty loud. I have small inclines when driving to work and I have to rev it up to go up those hills. Mileage is very bad. Only getting 26-27 mpg. Was hoping for above 30.

<TEXT>I just picked up my new white Fit yesterday after waiting almost 2 months to get. I thought that I was getting a black one, but when the white one came in I totally loved it. It's an exhilarating car to drive and I love its versatility. It's a little slow on the start, but if you have and use the sport model (I have that) you can shift through the gears and you feel with the use of the paddles that your in a raise car. I already cannot wait for an arm rest to come available as an option, because I really miss that from my Jeep and my previous Honda Civic!</TEXT>

I just can't seem to say enough about my Honda Fit Sport. I call this car my "Orange Scooter" because I just "scoot" place to place. No hassle getting in or out of tight places,etc. Also, the color is great, does not show the dirt and easy to keep clean. Plus, it is a cheerful color. The sound system is fantastic.

<TEXT>I have had the Fit (base manual) for about one month, and have about 5,400 miles on it already (wanted to get a few on it before I did a review). I can't say enough about the great gas mileage. I am getting over 38 on average with a mixture of city and highway driving. Highway only I cleared 40 mpg. For a small car it is very roomy and comfortable, even on the long trips. Anti lock brakes and 6 airbags are a nice feature for a small inexpensive car. Wish I had gotten the cruise control. No noticable lack of power except when the AC is on.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I ordered my red Fit in mid-April, got it at the end of May. I love the small size, the roominess, and the "cute" factor. The car is pretty comfortable, though it has a bit of a "hard" ride; but it handles well. I am getting around 28-29 MPG with 2000 miles on the car so far. I had a Geo Metro and this car is only 10" longer. I am less pleased by the very low front ground clearance. I almost tore the front bumper off yesterday on one of those invisible cement parking barriers at the local bookstore. The car will stall if I put it into gear too quickly upon starting in the morning. There are a couple of other minor issues I will have to deal with at the first oil change. Good car, though</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Size, size. I live in the city and it's nice to have a small car here. But inside it's huge! I am an artist and have put 42" by 60" pieces in the back. Handles well,too. Design is very European, and very classy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Honda Fit far exceeds my expectations. Good gas mileage, great handling, amazing interior design and space, superior saftey options standard compared to other cars in its class, and a good list of options all at a relatively good price. After comparing option to option with similar cars (go add on safety features, options etc to a Yaris or Versa and watch the price jump!), you will see the fit comes out at a good value. And due to good design on Hondas part it's also the most practical and fun to drive of these new crop of compact cars in my opinion. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had to drive my new Fit 1100 miles home from where I bought it. EPA said 38mpg hwy and it achieved 44mpg on one leg of the trip. On hilly sections it got as low as 36mpg. City mpg does stink though. If the AC is on, it'll dip into the 27mpg range with ease. My only beef with the car is the AC system. The day I bought the car I had to shell out $200.00 to have it tinted as dark as was legal and it is still hot as hades driving it. The second the AC system cycles off, you can tell it and it almost blows hot air at you. To describe it; just like you cracked the window on a 95+ degree day. It stays on 4 to drive comfortably. Overall, the car is awesome. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The peppiness of first gear is great. The Fit will dart across an intersection with no effort. The first gear of the 5spd automatic is extremely low and hits it's power range quickly. If you are wanting fuel economy, why even bother shifting? The automatic gets better mpg anyway. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a sweet little car that feels, sounds and rides more like a larger one does. The instrument cluster is simple and attractive. All the information you need is easily available. Five-star crash safety ratings, an extraordinary amount of room inside, a surprisingly quiet ride even at freeway speeds, plenty of performance (due in large part to a very smooth 5-speed automatic transmission), great gas mileage - and it is really fun to drive. The Sport model also has an excellent sound system. This is a typical Honda product: good-looking, smooth-riding, well-performing, well-built - a terrific value even at the window sticker price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power steering is tight, responsive and very easy. Nothing sloppy in the way this car drives or in the way it handles the road. The car sits up a bit higher than many small cars - easy to get in and out. Space for just about anything is ample. Our 6'5" son sits comfortably front or back.</FAVORITE>

The mileage is perfect for my long commute and I love having the aux input to the stereo.

<TEXT>For superior fuel economy, reliability, comfort, aesthetics, and just plain fun, the Honda Fit fits. The first two weeks after I bought my new Fit Sport, my daughter and I took my new car on two road trips. It outperformed our expectations in every area. Expect people to ask about your car wherever you go. It's cute and sassy and attracts attention. If MP3 connection, remote keyless entry, and cruise control are important to you, choose the Sport version. The trim that comes standard on the Sport is sexy too! I've owned Honda 70's CVCC Powder Blue 5 door wagon with manual choke, 80's Civic and Accord, 2000 S2000, (a Volvo850) and now this car. I may have to buy a second Fit for my kid!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This little car has lots of interior room. Gets great gas mileage. But I am giving it a poor review. The paddles that are position behind the steering wheel (used for standard transmission) will engage if you are driving in automatic at lets say 70 miles per hour. I accidentally tapped it when I used the turn signal and the car down shifted and went into standard mode. The car immedialty slowed while the engine reved up. I was terrified! It goes back into automatic after a few seconds but that long enough to cause an accident.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have a Fit Sport MT. We are very pleased with the Fit's ride, comfort, fuel consumption, and overall performance. The car performs well in stop and go city traffic, on country roads, and on the highway. Good ventilation with windows open for driving around town is refreshing. Concerns raised in early automotive reviews haven't been substantiated by our experience. The car handles hills, passing, and highway merges easily. Buying the Fit was unexpectedly stressful because of difficulty with supply, delivery dates, and color selection. This situation would be improved by ramped up delivery of the Fit to US dealers, and more reliable communication regarding inventory and availability</TEXT>

I started getting great gas mileage but now it dropped considerably. However, that may be a result of having to run the AC on high much of the time. After owning a gas guzzling SUV, it is nice not to have to be running to the gas station all the time. My family of 5 fits fine and I can accept the bumpy ride</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Fit 90 days ago. So far, so good. Its fun to drive and is pretty comfortable. Clearly a step up in the sub compact market. Downers are no arm rests, and small fuel tank. 2 more gallons would make the range awesome. But for now I still have to pull in to fuel more often than I would like. (but it only costs $20 so I don't complain much) If the longevity is up to Honda standards and crash ratings come in high then this will be a very big winner for Honda.

<TEXT>I traded in a Honda Accord EX - we wanted a smaller, more fuel efficient vehicle. The other MAJOR bonus is the possible seat configurations. For those of you who may occasionally need to haul something, but don't want an SUV, the seats are awesome. The interior space feels much larger than the car actually is; I was worried that the car might feel toy-like because of the size. I should have known better. It's a Honda - it feels solid and rides smoothly. The amazing part is, there isn't very much difference in seating and storage space than the Accord I had. The only significant difference we noticed was the depth b/t the front and back seats. Overall, we're loving our little FIT! GO! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the: --color (but beware, the storm silver is hard to get, and you will have to pre-order with a deposit. I suggest calling all area dealerships before driving around.) --the Magic seats! So many possibilities. I used to work for a furniture store, and after SUVS, a hatchback is the best. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Nice little car. I bought an AT Sport maybe should have waited for a MT Sport. The transmission consistently hunts at highway speeds (70-80mph) at any hint of an incline. The gas tank under the driver's seat encroaches on legroom. Excellent interior as well as handling and braking. MPG has been okay: 32-36. The 1.5L is not a typical Honda 4 cylinder, very coarse at high rpm (>4000rpm).</TEXT>

It handles wonderfully, parks easily, and the gas mileage is superb! All for a base model car with power windows/locks, AC, stereo, and awesome safety features!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Everything you touch in the Fit feels more like Acura than economy car. You won't feel like you have a 'cheap' car. The car handles brilliantly, accelerates very well and is fun to drive. Holds cargo behind the seats like an SUV (capacity rated nearly identical to the Honda Element) and gets 30-35 MPG. It's smaller than a lot of cars out there but all the airbags and the excellent crash test results are comforting. Its strong chassis does not bang and thud over rough pavement like some of its competition. A little more expensive than much of its competition (not so much when comparably equipped) but worlds better! We love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I live in the desert, so I always have the air on this car is a lot less peppy with the air on. The gas mileage suffers by about 7 hwy. MPG and 5 city MPG with the 5 speed manual having the air on. I think this car would be much better with a 6 speed transmission, on the Hwy. at 80 it is running at 4,800 rpm's in 5th gear. The gas mileage is still great just not as great as I had dreamed about.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the interior room the car has for as small as the car is. I traded in a 2001 Dodge Durango for this car and I think this car has just about as much interior space.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I replaced a 1986 Civic Si with this weak sister in April. Big mistake. My Si got about 15% better fuel economy and would run rings around my Fit. Top speed in 4th gear (5200 RPM): 101; top speed in 5th gear: 83. No kidding. 83 MPH. Disgusting. Oh, mediocre acceleration as well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I use my Fit to run around town, drive to work, get groceries, take short road trips (2 hrs), etc. Typically it's just me in the car but at least a few times a week I'm hauling two or three other tall adults along with me. I'm 6' 1" and the rest range between 5' 10" and 6'. Handling is responsive, engine is reliable, and fuel economy is great. The Fit usually gets between 30 and 32 mpg with a mixture of city and highway. However, I drive pretty aggressive so I'm very impressed considering my '03 Montero Sport averaged 16 to 17 mpg. Stereo works great but I'm not an audiophile. I wish the AC had a bit more cooling capacity but after getting darker window tinting this is not as big of an issue.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really appreciate the MP3 audio input. I love the storage capacity and how easy it is to change the seating configuration. I love how well the car handles both on city streets and on the highway. Feels safe and stable at 70mph. Love the look especially with the spoiler and sport rims.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Fit is a great urban runabout that was purchased to replace a 2002 Corolla. Reliability has been 100% over the first 30,000 miles. Comfortable front seats, easy gear change with the 5-speed stickshift. Engine is a bit short on torque, but then it's only a 1.5 liter. The OEM Dunlop tires were awful, and only lasted 18,000 rough and noisy miles. The replacement set of Coopers have been much smoother, quieter and better in the snow. Honda's fueling systems are so good that the car runs at 3,000 feet or 11,000 feet without any discernible difference. Would have bought the base model, but cruise control was not available - even as an option.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth fuel-efficient engine, that runs happily on Colorado's 85 octane gas; razor-sharp steering; cornering grip is limitless! Plenty of space inside; versatile rear seats & trunk area; solid build quality; tiny turning circle; makes the iPod sound great; 44 mpg on the highway at 70mph.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is fun to drive. had it since mid 06 sometime. Was trading in my explore for a accord or civic when they were putting them on the showroom floor. Was impressed with them and bought the first one from that dealership. Have been happy with it every since. Have had it on a 3400 mile and 2 2200 mile trips. Love it. have 43,000 mile on it. I use Royal Purple oil because i believe there is no better oil. Have done nothing to it. Kept my tires checked and oil change. My wife drives it instead of our Accord 6 cyl. She love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been driving my car for almost two years now, putting 100 miles daily. I love it. Fit is efficient and reliable. I waited 5 months for this car, back then it was "a new thing on a market". I already know it from Europe - they also loved it there. I put a lot of highway miles daily but it is no so big expense anymore. I easily get 40 mpg. It is surprisingly spacious inside - I often have a full trunk and things fit easily. Everything works well. The only thing I had to replace was tires, after 36,000.There is one thing that I don't like - the noise of the engine inside the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought a new Fit in 2007. So far we've seen an incredible savings in gas: anywhere from 32-38. Zoomy, responsive. Seats are a bit cheap and uncomfortable on long drives. We bring a pillow to sit on. Driver's legroom is not great for tall people. My husband is just 6 feet and needs the pillow to give his legs another few inches. Not many bells and whistles but that's not why we bought it. Very dependable so far. Great cargo space. We have been able to fit a TON of stuff in the back when you put the seats down. We joke that we can "fit" it in any parking space and we can "fit" anything into it. Handled well in the Vermont snow. Backseat is not super roomy but it's not terrible. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is everything you can ask for in a small, fuel efficient vehicle. and then it goes a step further. it offered handling and steering feel that is superior to the civic ex coupe and is trounced only by the si in terms of handling prowess. The controls are logically placed, the interior is top notch and a few steps ahead of all the cars in its class, that being that it also the oldest design. Economy is great, i average 33mpg mixed spirited driving, and maintenance has been very cheap. no major issues so far, as is typical in a Honda. Other sub 17k cars make you feel embarrassed or even bad getting into them everyday. You look forward to the drive with the Fit.</TEXT>

<TEXT>12 months and 60,000 miles. I think it's broken in. It is what I expected it to be. Get 40 mpg when I drive like an old man. My highway mileage is closer to 35 mpg. The ride is on a par with my Mustang GT. The workmanship is ok. The power is about what is expected from a 90 ci engine. I will say the acceleration is about like my old Buick 225's. 455 vs 90 ci. I'll take the 90. Passing? Chose the right gear, keep the rev's up and it does ok. Center armrest? Get a big, long, round pillow. A/C can't keep up? Tint the windows. Doesn't perform like you wish? It is what it is. Pretty darn good car, especially when you look at the price. Cheap carpet? Oh well, look at the price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>2nd review now that owned a year. 40+ hwy mileage, 26-29 city. Previous mileage problems now blamed on gas pumps. Car is stylish, very comfortable-great seats but don't clean easily with very nice interior design. Car has much more storage room than one thinks with very versatile interior. Front of car is very very low and often hits. Front of car is not visible so cannot judge distance and will hit parking blocks. Car has no pick up but then gets the mileage. The ride is comfortable for such a small car and handles nicely and zips right along on long trips. Load maximum is 850 which isn't much and wasn't discussed. Paint seems to mark easily and is necessary to wash with care.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This little car is worth a purchase if you are looking to save some money. It is extremely fun to drive, has a great looking interior, cargo space is suprisingly big (although it doesn't look it), and it is a Honda. This car has good acceleration, is lively on the highway even with 4 people in the car (though some may not think so)... remember this is not a Porsche. The magic seats are a great feature to load large items that a sedan will never be able to store. Test drive it and you will see what I mean.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our last car gave in to our dog. He sat in the back seat with our kid. Lots of hair and bad smells. Now, I have a huge hatch for our dog, still leaving the magic seats for our boy and our stuff. So cargo room is fantastic. Driving is so easy due to visibility, steering responsiveness, and very logical placement of driver controls. There are fewer small storage compartments than a Yaris, but I have all the storage I could use. Not wanting to ride a couch with wheels, I enjoy feeling the bumps in the road while sitting in very comfortable seats. The Fit is fun, functional and fabulous.</TEXT>

Had to travel 50 miles to find a dealer with the color and manual transmission we wanted - they're selling like hotcakes.

I averaged 34 miles to the gallon on my first tank, which will only get better as the engine breaks in:) I have two children and we aren't having any problems finding room for everyone and their stuff!

<TEXT>I'm happier with this car in the one week that I've owned it than I was with my Beetle... the first car that I ever loved:) This car is much more practical for today's varied needs. The design puts safety first, and flexibility a close second. This car can be set up like a computer lounge or a comfortable ride for the dogs... I can't say enough good things about it! Also, I just went on a 400 mile trip and was comfortable the entire time listening to my Ipod through the 200 watt speakers... was never bothered with engine noise or felt like I needed to 'stand up and shake out my legs' from sitting too long. And I was smiling at the gas station!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is just everything I wanted in a vehicle--a mini SUV-type that is practical yet fun to drive. It is unimaginably responsive. I was surprised that on the open interstate I easily took it over 90mph and not once did it feel out of control or blown about by larger trucks. In fact, just about anything is larger than the Fit, but you don't feel that way inside. I sit up so high that I feel that I am in a big vehicle and have to stop myself from taking on a Hummer! It is the tiny little thing with a big bad attitude. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love how the passenger airbag turns off when a child is recognized to be in the seat. I love the height and how I sit up off the ground. I love the way it feels HUGE inside and it can comfortahly seat 5. I love the way it handles. I love my Fit!!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Guys, I'm very impressed!. I was thinking to buy, stay with it than give it back to get a Civic. Well, after experience it... no more. I will stick with it for good!. Absolute fabulous. Designed for the city but much better composed during trips. It even makes you feel you're going slower than what you're actuallly going!( Here's why: My family and I went to Tucson, after the first hour on the trip I was pushing it a bit (to TEST ;)) going 100MPH at some stints, then I was in shock when my wife asked me "can you go faster than this" thinking I was going 65MPH or so. The exact same perception I had! and why I was pushing it to check .Now that's composure! Try it!</TEXT>

What a lack of foresight for such a great automobile company. Does this mean people who buy this vehicle should not take out of town road trips? Of all the design innovations, why were the folks at Honda that dumb to not include a engine temp. gauge. I live in Phoenix. Ever tried driving up to Flagstaff, AZ with the air conditioner on?

<TEXT>I have had this car for almost a week now and it is one of the best cars I have ever driven. With gas prices heading no where but up it's a good choice for us ladies who care little about speed and performance. The safety devices include six air bags and although it's a small car it feels so roomy on the inside. The ease of reconfiguring the seating is really nice. Don't even have to worry about breaking a nail when doing it. The controls are easy to understand and readilly accessable. It's the perfect Mom or Grandma car but I feel that the guys may not feel manly enough driving it. I chose the Sport Automatics since I like all the added features in the package. FIT is GO for us Gals!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Spent a lot of reading about many choices before test driving and narrowed it down to the FIT. I just love how it drives and I feel very safe and secure in it. Excellent positive "feel" of the wheel to the road. Like hearing the gears changing. AC works very quickly. I like the MPG I'm getting- a lot! Don't like hearing the gas sloshing around though. Performance is amazing, have to constantly watch speedometer and this from someone who my kids laugh at for going the speed limit. Boy are they surprised! That's actually why I didn't get a Milano Red. Braking is very smooth. I am very happy with this car and expect to have it many, many service-free years. Everyone says it's so cute too!!</TEXT>

Anyway, drive home on US HWYs as well as Interstate... driving speed at about 70-80 with no problems. Didn't notice a "buzz" or even too much wind noise.

<TEXT>We looked at the xA, xB, accent, Rio, Spectra, Civic, Sentra, Corolla, and others but after testing the Fit ...no contest... the Fit is far better than the others... its combination of looks, feel, room, features, price, & mileage are unmatched... definitely need to get the Sport... more than worth the extra money... the Civic has less room, less flexibility, less features, and less looks (opinion), all for a couple thou more... only advantage is more power. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought it for my wife who is a SUV driver. She absolutely loves it. She doesn't complain about the size or the power. I drove it for a couple of hundred miles and it was a blast to drive. Stock stereo is quite good. The origami seats are really innovative. I'd recommend a sport model with a stick shift. Stock tires are O.K but with low profile tires you are going to love it even more. We are getting 36MPG on both city driving and highway. Be prepared for the firm ride. </TEXT>

<TEXT>With 700 miles and 1 week in Honda's Fit, I'm enjoying the ride! It handles exceptionally well in the twisty Santa Cruz Mountains with enough power to keep up (and pass) most everyone. The interior is roomy and comfy with lots of of space to haul big items. The 5 speed manual has short, precise throws and the electric steering gives enough feedback for spirited driving. Despite it's small econo car looks, it is ready for a long drive with so many standard features (even more on the Sport model I own). The mileage so far is around 34mpg (twice my trade-in). The price point 'fits' the feature content. Everything works so far and I'm very happy with the Fit.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dash layout is clear and easy to use. The folding 'Magic Seats' create an incredible amount of room. The 5 speed shifts short and smooth. 34mpg really helps in light of the gas price increases. Small on the outside makes it easy to park. The quiet ride makes long commutes easy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I knew I wanted a hatch so I spied this in the latest car and driver. The FiT blew the competition out of the water. I checked it out and signed the same day. I love the handling. The suspension feels like something more likely to be on an acura and the electronic steering is amazingly precise. The sound system is great (especially that big, bright, blue screen). The shifter is precise and the clutch is light. This car truly makes city driving fun! It could use a few things like a dome light, armrest floormats and some more horesepower. But all of those things can be added so its not a major gripe. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We had done our research and were waiting for the Fit to become available. One drive was all it took to confirm that it was well built, great looking, roomy and fun to drive. It has nearly the leg room of our '03 Element EX and a phenomenal amount of room overall. I am 6'4" and can actually use the back seat comfortably with the front seat slid all the way back. The only things missing as options are a satellite radio and a moon/sun roof. The Fit really wants to get up and go; it's a blast to drive. It feels peppier and bigger than the Civic. It has side curtain airbags and numerous other safety features. I expect reliability to be typical Honda: excellent. Try one & you're hooked!</TEXT>

<TEXT>As soon as you sit in this car, you start bonding with the intuitive dashboard, attractive interior, firm no nonsense seats, sweet sound system and maneuverability. Take it out for a spin and at 33 mph city and 38 hwy, it makes driving fun again. The FIT A/T Sport with paddle shifters is suprisingly fleet and delightfully responsive. The seats are like oragami. You can fold them every which way. The result is a huge amount of cargo room and/or comfort for back seat passengers. Parking is a joy and so is the price tag at $16,000 out the door. This car is selling like hotcakes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very sensible vehicle. Stick shift is very accurate (my reference is Mazda3 2.3L 5-sp), and well mated to the engine, which has suprisingly enough torque to accelerate without frequent downshifting. Dash is well-laid, everything visible and within reach. Seating position is too low w/o height control, and that does not let the driver take advantage of the large windshield and short hood: visibility forward could be better. Cargo space and configurability is excellent, would be outstanding even for a much larger car. Nice rims, and right size tires for the car size and weight. Everything about this micro-van says "practicality", yet it is fun to drive, too</TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned this car for 1 week and had to trade it in. This has to be the most uncomfortable seating position in history! I was either too far from the wheel or too close to it w/no leg room. Drive it for more than the 15 minute test drive, youll be glad you did! The seat is poorly designed as well. I'm amazed that Honda sells these things so well in Europe (but I hear it has an adjustable seat height there). When fully loaded with friends, the ride suffers and can be harsh over bumps. Buy a Civic instead!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I wanted small wagon, and investigated most of the obvious choices. By the time we test-drove the Fit we had a pretty good idea what we wanted, and were both impressed immediately. The clinchers were the standard side airbags, antilock brakes, and the price. We've owned it for a week now. It's a blast to drive, the manual transmission is silky smooth, steering and brakes very responsive. The forward visibility is unbelievable as is the interior room. Main complaint is that the suspension is pretty taut. If you're looking for a budget-priced wagon, you should check this car out.</TEXT>

The handling is great for such a seemingly tall car. I traded in a mazda protege5 for this one and I gotta say, you wouldn't be able to tell that the mazda cost over $7000 more retail than the Honda. It is impossible to keep it slow and steady in this car, all you want to do is just red-line every gear from stoplight to stoplight - yes, it's THAT fun.

<TEXT>The Fit is one sweeeeeet ride. Comfortable, economical, great shifter, zippy performer, handles well. Even though it is a four-year-old design, it shows why Honda garners so many awards and loyal customers. I have heard it compared to the Chevy (Daewoo) Aveo in looks, but The Fit is a much more integrated design, and the interior is light years ahead of the Koreans. No other small hatchback, urban runabout or wagon comes close to the Fit, except perhaps the Scion xA. It is Storm Silver Metallic, sort of an almost charcoal grey, with black interior. The only major flaw is the lack of a sunroof option. Honda, great job! I will surely take a close look at the next-gen Fit in a few years! </TEXT>

<TEXT>If you need a car that is going to give you excellent gas mileage, is functional and surprisingly peppy, this would be worth looking at. With folding seats in the front and back, the entire inside seems to open up allowing one to transport large items with little difficulty. I purchased to extended warranty and feel good knowing that I have bumper to bumper protection for the first 120,000 miles or 6 years. The only drawback thus far is how the vehicle manages bumps and pavement breakups. On those occasions, the ride can be somewhat 'primitive' - hold on to your fillings! Power locks, windows and remote mirrors as standard accessories are nice touches. Overall, for around 15 grand, a terrific deal!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>nice job on the dash! Big, easy to locate and read guages. The lighted blue gauge accents are head turners. The fan on full blast creates quite a windstorm. Entering and exiting the car is a snap - no small feat for a subcompact car. I am 6'3'' and easily fit .</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was recently on the hunt for a new car- something small, reliable, and fuel efficient. Fuel prices are off the roof and are only expected to get worse by summer. I was researching on a few small cars, such as the new Yaris and Rio, but they didn't seem to have the thing that I wanted. The second I stepped into the Fit, I immediately knew it was for me. The interior is stylish and high quality. The exterior is also very stylish and looks like many European cars. The thing that amazed me that most was the ROOM INSIDE! WOW! The seats fold down and there is a GIGANTIC amount of space. The performance is also amazing. So smooth, sporty, and quiet. Like a dream. The fit grows on you. I love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The amount of space, the comfort, and convenience. Great audio system, excellent on long trips; it amazes me how people get cars with less space for 4 times the money. The Fit is also very stylish and extremely fuel efficient. You will love it when you first drive it! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Fit is fantastic. I needed something fuel efficient, and something to transport dogs and bikes. I looked at other hatchbacks, new and used, and this seemed like the most bang for the buck, even brand new. I was in awe at the amount of interior space for such a tiny-looking car. With the back seats folded flat, I can fit 2 bikes, luggage, 2 dogs and 2 people! I can also fit both dogs in the back/hatchback area and 4 people in the car simultaneously. I have friends that borrow the Fit to move furniture (chairs, dressers) - something typically reserved for trucks, but the Fit can handle it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had four new Hondas over the years plus one Prelude I bought used. I thought I could trust Honda to build a good car. Wrong. My wife's car is a (shorter) '95 Tercel 2-DR automatic. The mileage is low on the Fit because the Tercel is more fun to drive for all small-load trips, both grocery- store and X-country. Here's why: Seats too low; no lumbar support; paddled steering wheel uncomfortable; body too wide (turn radius, parking, traffic); ride jittery and steering too quick (needs constant attention on frwy); instruments poor, and disappear in sunlight; fast cornering not fun; windshield posts too thick (pedestrians); transmission gasps; mileage mediocre. The brakes are good. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I currently have 23,000 miles on my Fit Base model that I purchased for my wife in September 2007. I have had no issues period with this car. It has made several east coast trips in the last few months. One trip down to FL averaged 42 MPG (with a tail wind)!!! That is just as good as my 1996 Civic CX that has 420,000 miles. The ABS system in this car is awesome, even while trailering to motorcycles. I made my own trailer hitch and have been moving everything I own down to FL, much cheaper than renting a truck. The interior is extremely comfortable, and the ride feels sporty even while lacking the get up and go to match it. All in all a great quality car well worth my cash.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The dash layout is perfectly ergonomic, everything within reach. Fuel economy is awesome. I have been using this car to move from NC to FL pulling a trailer with anywhere from 1,000 to 1,500 LBS each trip while averaging between 26-29 MPG! (Don't tell Honda Service)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I keep saying that "I love my car". My family is sick of it. I ran my fit to the empty line on gas. With air conditioning blaring on high all the time, it gets 25/30. With it on low most the time, I got 34/36 mpg. Yes, 36 mpg while commuting highway! It took over a year for my Fit to even show decent gas mileage, but they dealer had warned me about this, and knowing a great number mechanics and tow companies helped with not hading ridiculous expectations. It runs well, and with constant upkeep and regular checkups it shifts perfectly, and does not pull as a few other reviews have said. Keep your tire pressure up properly, and the noise goes away too. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Fit! I live in the city, and the Fit's small size makes parking a breeze. But, I'm also a performer and I need to haul all manner of costumes, props and set pieces to and from shows. Despite the Fit's deceptively small exterior, I can pack a TON into the back. And, when I'm not hauling a full load of cargo, my two dogs and I pile in and we can zip around town. My only criticism is in regards to gas mileage. I've never achieved the 31-38 mpg range advertised. I average about 26 mpg in the city and (if I'm lucky!) 30 mpg on the highway. Other than that- no complaints at all!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've driven my Fit for almost 2 years now. I don't have any major complaints. I drive a 30 mile commute twice a day on highways and average 36 mpg- cruising at around 75 MPH. I can get 3 grandkids (one in a booster seat), a large Lab in the back end and 2 adults up front. I've carried large boxes and lumber with ease. A 1300 mile road trip in my manual transmission Fit was most comfortable and economical.

<TEXT>This has been one of the best automobile purchases I have ever made. The mighty Fit continues to impress me with its amazing cargo space and fuel economy. I've averaged 33.8 mpg with a low of 30 mpg (100% city stop & go driving) and a high of 40 mpg (100% freeway at 75 mph). As a drummer I'm able to load a full kit with all hardware and room for a front passenger...amazing! I've also moved furniture and other large pieces. When someone helps me load, they always say, "This won't fit in that little thing...whoa! It did fit!" I did replace the wheels and tires with a larger foot print as the stock wheels seemed to travel a lot on grooved surfaces. Highly recommended!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Although I'd like to have a little more umph out of my cars, it's really hard to complain about the Fit. The 5sp transmission shifts smoothly and the suspension hugs the road like a much more performance oriented car would. There is plenty of space in the interior and the rear seat are truly "magic" as Honda quotes them. The rear hatch is huge, especially considering how it all looks from the outside. Overall I love the car. Great fuel economy, more than ample space, and best of category handling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Honda. I bought it to replace a Ford Explorer because of the gas prices. I still wanted a vehicle I could throw a bale or two of hay in the back and this fit the bill. I fell in love with it immediately. It's a blast to drive and the stereo system is great! I think it's comfortable and peppy although I have to admit I haven't even used the paddles yet. I only drive about 7 miles in it a day and have to say the gas mileage hasn't been what was expected. As for the armrest, yes that stunk but I had a custom one made for about $100 and it's not one of those plastic ones from Hong Kong. It looks custom. I highly recommend it all my friends and my stepmom is even considering one</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car executes its purpose wonderfully! I have two car seats in the car and even on long trips with all of the kids stuff (such as a pack-n-play in truck), this car still has room. The transmission is wonderful, and even though it must shift down to 4th gear in the West Virginia mountains because the engine is small, it does it with grace. I have driven better cars, but none that were offered at this price point. The car darts in and out of traffic, navigates tight parking lots with ease, and is terrific on gas. The only reason why I would ever get rid of this car is if we continue to only have one car and a third kid comes along. Until then, the Fit is Go!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car in Feb. 2007 and have already put over 31,000 miles on it. I often drive rather quickly (on interstates, highways, and back roads) and have never gotten below 36 mpg. The Fit's suspension is pretty stiff which may turn off some drivers, but I think it makes little little car really fun to drive on twisty roads. As someone who often gets buyer's remorse with large purchases, if I had it to do all over again, I would still buy the Fit. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning this car for 7000+ miles. Heres my review. Gas mileage is great. However ive owned alot of other hondas. The interior is functional, however made of cheap componets (all plastic) and its easily dammaged. Road noise is excessive above 70mph (due to no sound reducing materials to save weight). The car is functional as a daily driver. I love it. The 2 biggest gripes i have, are the paint is cheap! And auto car washes will destroy your car. And the wipers, well used them before you buy. Not as functional as they planned, smearing and passanger wiper arm is huge and flutters in the rain. I give the car a 7 outta 10, after owning 5+ Hondas.</TEXT>

I've avereged 35 on mixed city and interstate driving. The sound system is good for CDs, but FM reception is relatively poor. Seats are more comfortable that I expected for a small car. Visibility is excellent; it feels like you're sitting higher than you really are. I love the large, flat front window, but the back window gets dirty a lot from slush blowing upward from the back tires. When on low-beam, the front lights are set too low, so it is hard to anticipate road hazards or read signs</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 10,000 miles in 4 months, I was expecting the car to settle in and drive more smoothly, plus improve gas mileage. But, it didn't! There is something in the automatic transmission called "Engine Braking System." This is a horrid piece of engineering. On deceleration to an intersection, it grinds the car down to a stop by itself without touching the brake. Don't know what this feature is for, but it has been a little dangerous in city driving. I hope there is a "fix" soon from Honda. I think it may be contributing to my less-than-expected gas mileage of 26-30. That said, I am very happy with the rest of the car! Decent power, great cargo capacity! But should have waited for a 5sp manual.</TEXT>

The 200-watt stereo is quite adequate, with an unexpected amount of bass coming froms the mids (no sub). Space is amazing! It's much roomier than it looks; at least, that's what everyone has said to me when they've got a ride.

My 86 SI was noted for its spritely acceleration at a 0-60 time of 9.8 sec but the Fit is considered a dog with the same numbers. I drive in the foothills of the Sierra Nevadas and I amazed how little I have to take it out of 5th gear. It will easily pull out in fifth from about 20 mph without stumbling. I would say the engine and tranny are well mated. It is quiet for a small car and it shifts better than my 86 which was lauded for its smoothness. Its a great car that needs nothing.

<TEXT>Terrible seats and driving position, no armrest nor left foot rest. Automatic transmission has a 3-4 second hesitation when you step down on it at low speeds, 2-4 mph, before it downshifts to 1st gear. This is very dangerous at intersections, and has almost gotten me t-boned on several occasions. They are all like this, according to Honda, who could care less. I drove 2 others and they have the same hesitation. Honda should be forced to recall the automatic Fits and fix this dangerous defect! This has really soured me on Honda, even though I had no problems with previous Hondas. Not enough power. Gas mileage less than expected. Handling, cargo capacity good.

<TEXT>Now have 37,000 miles and out of warranty. No reason to go back to the dealer except routine maintenence. Still look forward to driving it daily. I've read many comments and here's my take: Who wants to steal 10 gallons of gas when pickups hold 35 gallons? No need for a lock IMHO. Plenty fast, just accelerate in the 4 - 5.5K rpm range. It can take it all day. 4 people with A/C in hilly territory - yea, you have to row it some. But with 4.30/1 gears it jumps off the line. Small tank - it's OK cause I keep enjoying confirming the 35 mpg average I get using all 109 HP. I've forgotten about the dead pedal issue. No lit vanity mirror, locking glovebox, and armest not a deal breaker.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really have only one major complaint: the automatic transmission. It lurches and bucks on acceleration. Also, when braking or coasting to a stop, something under there is helping me stop. It is called the "engine braking system." In theory, I suppose it's a good thing. But it is very annoying. It makes the car surge when it upshifts. I feel like I am losing control. I'm very disappointed with this little bucking bronco. Otherwise the car is great! Great features (stereo), great handling. Good performance once I get it up to highway speeds. The gas mileage is a little disappointing. I get 28 to 32 mpg. Was hoping for mid 30s. Wish I had waited for a 5-speed manual.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>I Love my FIT!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I love this car! This car has more room than my other Honda and Nissan (Xterra). I love driving it, the gas mileage, the handling, the way it looks... everything about it! We've had 2 tall adults, 1 teenager (5'7") and 2 kids (11yrs) in the car with no problem. When we got out, people were looking at us like "How in the world..." I'm looking forward to the 2009 Fits! If you're looking for a small gas friendly reliable car, FIT IS GO!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The airbags, the interior room, Magic seats, radio... just about everything.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought a slightly used Fit Sport with 6400 miles on it Sept '07. I really like it, drives a bit different than my old '94 Camry Wagon,probably shorter wheel base and better suspension is the reason. The Fit is actually peppier and handles better than any car I've owned except my Old RX-7. It fits 4 adults easily, holds a full grocery cart of stuff behind the back seat without any hassle. I love the various seat configurations. nearly as much cargo room as the Camry Wagon had with easy access. Interior & exterior quality are top choice, but seats could be a bit better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I took delivery of my new '07 Fit Sport, 5 spd. on September 22, 2007. I have driven about 1800 miles already. I bought this as my commuter car and I will be driving over 40,000 miles a year. Overall, I think it's a super vehicle. I could live with little issues such as no lock on the gas cap or the glove box, small fuel tank, etc. The only real issue I have with the car is the tire drumming/thumping over washboard surfaces and sharp bumps (5% of my drive). The ride does not bother me. It's the drumming of the tires that is killing me. I've lowered my tire pressure to just over 30 psi but it does not make a big difference.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love this car. Great gas mileage, great handling, and just great looking (I might be one of the three people on Earth who actually likes the aesthetics of the Fit). I have always preferred smaller cars, and now I have a small car that can actually carry cargo. No more borrowing a truck from a friend! Very convenient for city driving- I can fit into any parking space, and have no problems executing U-turns on narrow roads.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First of all, I think the fit is an excellent car. After living with it for a year here are the lacking features: no locking gas cap, no dead pedal, no centre arm rest, thin carpet, the front of car is too low (may hit curb), hard to see front of car, blown easily in crosswinds, slightly noisy, seats get slightly uncomfortable after 1-2 hours. When I bought the Fit, I had a budget in which I could have purchased any car. I bought the Fit because: excellent reliability, great versatility WRT interior space, looks nice, fun to drive, good value, good fuel economy, has ABS and 6 airbags. I can easily live with all the minor deficiencies of this car because of the car's good points.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Cute car, good throttle response. Very weak engine on just rolling hills - always downshifting. Car would be hell to drive in mountainous terrain. Have no idea why Honda did not and does not swap this 1.5L for the Civic 1.8L. Increase HP from 109 to 140 with better gas mileage, engine would still fit. No brainer from my perspective. Have 3000 miles over the first month, and have been getting 28- 30 in 50/50 city/highway driving. Terrible, should be getting at least 34 and on straight highway at least 37 MPG. Message boards do seem to vary a lot on the mileage reports. Honda, why can't a 2600 pound car get 35+ for mileage when my 2003 Civic averages 33mpg city and 36mpg highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove a Mustang prior to this purchase, which was based on Honda's reputation and fuel economy. I didn't miss my Mustang like I thought I would. The Fit is fun to drive, easy to park, and gets great gas mileage. Back seats are horribly uncomfortable. The side airbags are nice too. Like a mini- SUV. However, my husband was just in an accident in his Fit and I must say while the airbags & seatbelt did a great job protecting him, the car is a total loss while the vehicle he hit was barely damaged. The damage was to the front driver-side part of the car, and the fender, dash, door, etc. were all shoved back, roof wrinkled. Like to see the metal strenghtened so it's safer. Speed was 50-55 mph.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I haul a bunch of stuff around, often a really-large number of articles--had always used a van (Dodge minivan), which was very good for this purpose. Test drove the Fit, the Yaris, the Versa, the Scion xB. My new Fit is, well, perfect for general driving, and on most days, I have plenty of room for hauling stuff, with lots better MPG's than my van. Saving lots of money in gas in this fine little car that has a big, useful interior. Rear seats fold absolutely flat, leaving bunches of room. My first Honda--probably won't be my last.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fold-flat, "magic" seats. Easy to park. High seating position (compared to many small cars). Great gas mileage. Relatively small console (who needs a stinkin' big console? not me)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I absolutely love this car. I bought it a couple of weeks ago after test driving the Yaris (boring). I love the gas mileage and it's a blast to zip down the interstate. It's also easy to get in and out of parking spaces, which is definitely a perk now a days. I wanted the cruise control, which is why I opted for the Sport. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Took delivery on 8/29 and have about 150miles on it already. traded in 2000 accord EX, with some dickering got price with tradein to under $10k. This is a fun car to drive, a/c worked excellent in our heat wave, pick up is excellent, visibility excellent. as with other Honda's, came loaded with everything I needed. Keyless entry is a dealer installed option which I don't need. Since I just got the Fit, hoping the Honda relability is there. Buy one</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Honda. I bought it as a replacement for my wife's old Ford Escort, but it has become my car of choice. I am a big guy (6'2", 225 lbs.), but this little car is very comfortable and spacious. The seats offer excellent lower back support. Reports of sluggish performance are absolutely untrue. The Fit is lively, responsive, and fun to drive. The manual shift is the smoothest I have ever used. The fuel economy is better than I expected--up to 41 mpg on the highway (at 70 mph) and 35-38 in mixed driving. The cargo capacity, with the rear seats folded down, is amazing. My wife and I love this car and hope to have it for a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT> Some of the online reviews of this car had me worried while I was waiting for mine - but I love it!! We just returned from a 2600 mile vacation in it, and found it to be great on the freeway and even passing at highway speeds. This was with a fully loaded car, four adults and all our luggage! We took 4 large duffel bags,two stuffed backpacks and a large cooler!The seats could be somewhat more comfortable, but it was no less comfortable than my 97 civic and I find it to be a more peppy car. I would buy this car ten times over, I have owned both a 300 hp car and motorcycles, and this is both fun to drive and safer! My blue sport is the Honda I've been waiting for!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fit handles well. The manual transmission shifts easily and the Fit accelerates nicely for a 1.5 liter engine. he front seats are comfortable; the back seats tolerable for short trips. The floor mats have anchor holes, but there are no mat anchors and the front mats slide around. Gas mileage thus far nearly 38 miles per gallon, mostly suburban driving. Front air dam scrapes on low angles. Easily accessed oil filter for d.i.y. types. Could use a locking gas cap. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>38 miles per gallon during break in period. Handles nicely, accelerates briskly. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well, I just purchased a new fit the day before yesterday, august 14th, and what can i say other than I'm immensely impressed by Honda's attention to detail. I was looking at many other vehicles, ( mazda 3, yaris, versa, etc ), and ended up test driving the fit and falling in love. This is the most fun to drive car I've ever had, and my past has had a 99 Celica, and a 91 mustang in it, both of which aren't slouches in the fun department either. Its aggressively styled, and is miserly on fuel. The audio system is great with some adjustment, and the overall feel of the car is excellent. Good job Honda, you've outdone yourself with this little beauty of a daily driver. :) </TEXT>
