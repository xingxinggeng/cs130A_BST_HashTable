<TEXT>Had no problems so far with the vehicle at almost 35000 miles,comfortable heated front seats, large blind spots to rear, mirrors could be much larger as in former Pontiac Grand Prixs previously owned, much road noise, when sun roof is opened impossible to hear or talk above 30mph, noisy tires</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Like complete colored keyed interior, no gray dashboards and steering wheels which 2010 have, good stereo with xm, excellent heat and ac, poor rear vision, mirrors too small, mileage 21 city, 24-28 highway, great trunk space especially with rear seats down, like storage area under rear seat, </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Powerful engine but 305hp keeps it below competitors, FWD kills the fun, 16mpg, interior quality is really bad my radio or my exhaust makes rattles inside the car really annoying and embarrassing. Single exhaust with dual tips very deceiving You can't even modify it to a true exhaust. Due to the side mounted manifold mount and the single pipes dug in to underbody. The fun went out fast never buying a chevy SS ever they ruined impala SS. The only good thing it's the comfort ride and size. If u looking for a performance sedan look at legacy gt or charger rt better or same mpg better speed and size and a hole lot better quality by far and most of all fun to drive! </TEXT>

<TEXT>A very acceptable form of transportation. I went from a Malibu to the Impala; missing the outside temp gauge, rear folding seats in the Impala LS vs the Malibu LS. No telescoping steering. MPG is good for the size of the vehicle. Handling is terrific in straight line :-). Overall a decent car for the price. Check the NHTSA website for recalls and technical service bulletins this car is riddled with them, most are minor but worth considering if you are going to buy one. This is a company supplied car for me so I don't get much say in brand choice. Honda and Toyota have nothing to fear however.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just LOVED my Impala and thought I couldn't have been more satisfied with a car like I had been with this one! However, I have noticed in the past month or so that the door molding is tearing out of the door, the trim between the front and back doors is getting spots sorta' like the paint is fading off and NOW - TODAY - IT HAD TO BE TOWED IN TO THE SERVICE SHOP! I have less than 35,000 miles on my car, the battery is fine but there is problem with the electrical system. Also, I get disgusted with the tire sensors too!!!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was the third Chevy I bought in succession. The prior two were a 1998 Monte Carlo and a 2003 Impala LE. I chose the SS for the added torque and performance that are missing in the V6 Impala models. The car handles well and the performance is there when needed. Gas economy is fair. I have had no mechanical issues with this car. I have all regularly scheduled maintenance done either at the dealers or at the local Jiffy Lube. I tore the fiberglass front running it up on some snow in a parking lot last winter. I am sure that this will be an issue at lease end. I was surprised at the amount of damage for such minor impact. The front design of the car is unforgiving for minor impact</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, Power, Power. Car runs hot off the line as equipped. Part of my daily commute requires a high-speed merge onto an interstate. Chevy SS never disappoints. Car does require high-octane 90 or better. If you try plus grades, you will notice drop off in torque, hear results.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Powerful and great in gas. For those of you that are having problems with the tire pressure monitor system and your warranty expired it is easy to fix and all under $50 (for each tire but usually not all sensor go at the same time) Just get the sensor on an online auction and go to your local tire shop. They will install it for about $15. To reset it is easy just follow the owners manual.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like everything on it. For those DIY's you will appreciate how easy it is to reset the tire positions, the oil light and even to add a new keyless remote. You don't have to go to the dealer for this as in other cars.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you are looking for a car with all of the 'bells and whistles', look no further. This car is comfortable, stylish, provides a smooth excellent ride, and has a really good fuel economy. It is really a well made and low maintenance vehicle. We bought ours 2 years ago, and have just under 20K miles on it. The only problem we have had was this past winter with the Onstar feature freezing up, but other than that no problems.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall nice car. I have 28kMi and no problems other than the typical tire pressure monitor sensor. I lowered the car 1 inch with Eibach springs because I did not like the body roll and the noise dive experienced with the original springs. Ride quality suffers a little with the new springs but overall worth it for me as it makes the car look much better and it did help reduce the body-roll and noise dive dramatically.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for a couple weeks now and absolutely love it. I went with the black on black color scheme, and recently had the windows tinted for a more stealthy look. The instrument panel and exhaust note remind me of my old '91 Camaro (305 V8), and with a proper launch this car is even faster. I would prefer RWD, but I am still very impressed with how well my new Impala accelerates, rides, and handles. The exterior styling is pretty low-key, with the exception of the rear spoiler which is in my view a bit much.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you are looking for a practical sedan with style and power, this is your car. This car is a real sleeper. GM has finally gotten the audio system right with XM, Ipod jack, and Bose speakers. The interior is very nice and the 303 HP V8 5.3L packs a lot of power. I had an '02 Impala and put 120k on it in 5 years with only a catalytic converter issue at 60k which GM fixed under warranty. This '07 is much nicer. The ride is quiet and smooth. The fuel management system is only noticebale by the savings at the gas pump - the power is there when you need it. I only wish that it was RWD. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle has been trouble from day one. I?ve been averaging 15 mpg. Vehicle is incapable of driving straight, three alignments and a new set of tires helped marginally. Been running tires around 40 psi (10 above recommended) and this seems to help slightly. Key fob has been replaced once, antenna twice, window switch, brake pads, vehicle has a no start problem, rear view mirror vibrates, temperature gauge broken, clunking in rear suspension, reflashed ECM, squealing from alternator, exhaust rattle, and a number of other problems that I can?t think of at the moment. I?ve had the car to multiple dealerships, and they only seem to be able to fix the simplest of problems. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my company car and all I have to say is this GM car is junk. Fortunately for me, I didn't have to pay a penny for this car. I have nothing good to say about it and a lot to complain about. My biggest complaint is the uncountable number of design "flaws". For example, when you open the trunk on a rainy or snowy day, water or snow spills into the trunk compartment! The car also has poor handling, cheap materials and a build quality that leaves much to be desired. Spend your money on a Toyota, Honda or Nissan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My SS has all the options. I've only owned this car for a month and have about 1000 miles on it. So far, I'm very pleased with it. Car appears very well put together, best of any GM product I've had experience with. I haven't experienced any rattles or squeaks. It's hard to argue with the performance of this car. Suspension is a nice compromise between ride comfort and reasonable handling. A good driving car. I'm averaging about 23mpg in mixed driving, but 30mpg looks doable on the highway. The fairly loose torque converter hurts the mpg in stop-and-go situations, and I'm not sure exactly why they made that choice. Minor point, though, IMO. Seats are a bit flat, radio is ridiculous.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a fabulous car. All it took was one test drive and it was sold. The power is tremendous, yet it is comfortable and rides very smooth, even with 18 inch wheels. It's nice to see an American car company finally stick it to those imports. There is no way anyone would even think about buying a Camry or Accord after driving this. Faster, more solid, and a little less money. It's great!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, a few members in our family have the Toyota Camry and have been trying to get us also purchase one. However, for almost the same price if not cheaper, the Imapala was the better chose for us. Roomier inside then the Camry and bigger trunk space. Love the feature for the air conditioning. I can set mine seperate from the drivers setting. Also enjoy the features for viewing your tire pressure, odometer and how many miles left before the next gas pruchase. All around this car is superior over any of the Nissan, Toyotas, Kia etc. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned this Impala 3LT for about a month. Overall, the quality and performance is quite satisfactory. I am impressed with the quietness of the interior and the power of the 3.9 V6. The vehicle is smooth and stable on the highway. However, I do have some suggestions for improvements. The floor mounted shifted needs a gear indicator. The front bucket seats need more lateral support/bolstering. The dashboard section containing the gauges is bland...where are the ammeter and oil pressure gauges like the Mercury Gran Marquis has? Is a tachometer really necessary in this car? The DIC should be separate from the speedometer. Why is there no key- operated lock on the glovebox?</TEXT>

<TEXT>The LS is the value here. I think you will be dissapointed if you spend more the upper trim levels; hey, it's a Chevy not a Mercedes. I found it to have better handling and braking than Ford 500. Handling is even better once I replaced the stock(cheap quality) tires with the Pirellis that the police package Impala uses. Would not have purchased if it didn't have 100k warranty. Not all cars on the lot are flex fuel so pay attention. Also, watch out if buying used: used rental car fleets tend to not have ABS or head airbags. Had a bad radiator cap that took two visits to diagnose. Other than that, flawless. I have 11k miles on it after 5 months of ownership. </TEXT>

<TEXT>If you drive it, you will buy it! The SS version is a great all around car. I still have not enjoyed the Bose music system because I cannot get enough of the exhaust sound. Has 800 miles on it and no problems whatsoever. The interior is very functional, back seat bottom folds up to reveal a storage area that can take a beating versus the leather. Trunk is very large and the ride, while some say it is not firm enough, is almost perfect. The tire replacement cost is going to be high (18") but the car's performance and workability is a big plus. I recommend a test drive of the SS version. Once you do, you will not consider the lesser versions.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is exceptionally well designed and built for the money. Biggest praise goes to the performance as the car will actually break the drive tire loose when cruising at over 30 mph if the accelerator is pressed hard. The active fuel management is a great innovation and definitely improves fuel economy when the car is not driven hard. For anyone out there who is dissapointed in this system just lay off the accelerator a bit and it will perform its intended function quite well. I've driven this car for just over 2,000 miles now and the ride and handling are superb, steering feel and response is best of any vehicle I've ever owned, brakes are balanced with great stopping power and pedal feel.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature on this vehicle, of course, is the V8 engine. I also like the steering wheel controls for the radio and cruise control. The heated leather seats, large no nonsense gauges, overall ergonomics, and clean looking dash are a winner. Interior materials have a sporty yet quility look. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have always been a Chevy fan. After Chevy dropped the Camaro I was disappointed like millions of others. I hope the brain behind that move got canned. They have now returned with a true performer. Chevy started the muscle car era with the '55 Chevy. They have now built a car that others will follow and try to catch just like the '55. This car is a bargain for what you get! I'm very pleased!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a 2007 LT3. Car looks good, nice interior, good build quality, handles well. 3.9 engine is smooth and offers very adequate power. Gas mileage is disapointing. I had a 2003 with 3.4 engine that would get well over 30 mpg on hwy and mid to upper 20's in town driving. LT3 with 3.9 gets 16 mpg in town aND 25 on hwy.

<TEXT>Overall, the 2007 3.9L Impala LTZ compared well with the our previous GM car, 1998 3.8L Lumina LTZ. The engine performs well with nice pickup, but sometimes lugs down in 3-cyl mode before switching. With 4000 miles on car, the average fuel economy for 87 octane fuel is 20 mpg for combined city/highway driving, which is alright but not a good as expected. Engine access for maintenance work is much improved. The car does sound to be less sound proof than older car with noticeable wind and road noise, not sure if this is due to rear-door driver-side alignment.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Much improved interior robustness and styling. Very thankful of improved trunk design tons of space and rear seat access. Love the heated seats and firmness of the car on the road. Auxillary input jack for stereo for iPod use. Digital driver information center.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I never rate anything a 10! Only had this car for 7 weeks - 1600 miles but so far am well pleased. Fully loaded. Imperial blue/gray interior. 20 - 22 mpg with very little highway driving. Leased 3yr/36000mi. Selected for style and features to replace a 99 300M. Great trunk space for 4 golf bags. Quiet riding. Suspension seems a little rough on minor road bumps and seems to hesitate a bit when going from 3cyl to 6 cyl mode in city driving but overall driving is a pleasure. I'm a large sedan type of a guy and this was a good choice especially with the lease incentive and rate and my GM Mastercard rebate.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had a 2000LS (Great car) and so I bought a 2007 LTZ. The 2007 car is smaller and the back seat has little leg room, leather seats are not comfortable, back seat sholder belts are ratchet type and close to smallest size and won't relase without releasing the belt(everybody that uses these complains there too tight) I'm getting 16 to 19.5 MPG which includes 25% highway driving and 3 cylinder engine mode( I'm an easy driver and this is much worse then the 2000) The outside mirrors are smaller and have a bad blind spot,(beyond me why they don't incorporate a small wide angle mirror into the rearview and why the insurance companies don't promote this). Make sure the car serves your needs! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>XM radio/cd/ MP3 radio together with the Bose speakers is nice. Various upgrades are nice. I would have preferred the option of getting the E85 engine like the LT3 has.

<TEXT> 2007 Impala SS is a slick pavement grinder while having a refined and quiet ride. The MPG's are not as high as advertised, but the performance and drive-ability help to make up for the MPG deficiency. It is very difficult to back this car up as the rear vision is hampered by the high rear headrests, spoiler and raised back end. The interior dash and displays are cheap looking, operating and feeling. There is a lot of front interior leg, hip and shoulder room but the rear leg room is compromised, especially for those over 6ft. Exterior road noises are sufficiently</TEXT>

<TEXT>It was time to replace the minivan (family truckster) this year and I wanted to improve on my fuel economy, so I went shopping for a car. Of course I researched right here on Edmunds and narrowed the focus to two cars, the Chevy Impala and the Buick Lucerne. The Lucerne is nice, but the Impala was nice too and an awsome value. This car is like the person that shows up in kakies and a polo shirt to the party and offers to help imediately! Nobody notices this person but they are indispencable. So it is quiet, moves out well with the 3.9L (I used to have a Mustang GT; this car is quick!), handles well, and I am averaging 24 MPG in city driving! An all around best buy in my opinion.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I waited two months and a day for my new Impala to get here. I ordered it on 6/14/06 and it came in 8/15/06. I was on pins and needles waiting for it. Now that It's here I love it. I like the AFM (6cyl to 3cyl) for helping with fuel economy while it only has a few less hp (233hp) than the 1999 Mustang GT 4.6L 35th anniversary editon convertible (260hp) that I'm replacing. Having said that, going from a RWD to a FWD and from a V-8 to a V-6 I'm really noticing a lack of performance. Now, I realize that a sports car is supposed to run better and faster than a family sedan, so I'm not comparing apples to apples, but I'm really happy with the ride and performance of my new Impala!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Everyone who recommended that I get a Camry or Accord raised their eyebrows when I said I had chosen an Impala. I got it for its E85 compatibility, the wide bench seat and column shifter, and the great fuel economy for a V6.

<TEXT>Having looked at hundreds of reviews and test driven at least a dozen different used sedans,I settled on the Impala. Why? Power. The Impala LT has 211 horsepower, the equivalent Camry only 155. The difference on the road is not slight. Nor is the price. The 2007 Camry I was looking at was going for 19,000, The Impala for 14. It was no contest. I tried a Honda Accord and the seats nearly destroyed my back just in a test drive. Way too hard as was the price. The Impala is a light, very quick sedan with bucketloads of power. The transmission wants to clunk out of first gear unless you hit the gas. This is a car that WANTS to be driven quick. A light, excellent handling, powerful sedan. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet, quick handling, excellent sound system with killer bass. Good fuel economy, decently comfortable, Canadian engineered, designed and built (one of the reasons I bought it).

Now that I just rotated my tires, it doesn't happen quite so often, but it is annoying. On top of that, in the MN cold weather, the radio doesn't turn on when starting the car - just makes a static sound so I have to turn it off until the engine warms up. Haven't brought that to the attention of my dealer yet. Otherwise, this is a smooth ride and I get lots of compliments on how it looks. I feel very safe in it, too!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I thought I would update my 01/21/08 review to help fellow readers; my ratings have been adjusted a little bit. Since Jan '08 I have added a complete Magnaflow exhaust system, K&N intake, and had the car extensively dynotuned. I realize these are steps most owners will not take to fully explore the SS's capabilities, but if you do-- wow! Highway MPG is up slightly, 0-60 times are down to the low 5's, HP is now around 335. Friends and clients often ask to drive the car; they love the room, the power, and how tight the car feels. My SS is Silverstone Metallic & garners many "That's so classy!" comments. The only downside is that I've had the steering shaft replaced under warranty. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Without a doubt, "The Sleeper Factor". I found the ride to be a bit harsh with the OEM 18" wheel/tire combo, so I switched to a 17" LTZ wheel/tire combo which I found on eBay.

<TEXT>I bought this car because of the high safety ratings. It proves to be a well built and reliable car. It has a nice exterior design, classy look, without being too trendy. The interior is very nice. I love the dash with the woodgrain interior. This car offers lots of room inside and has ample trunk space. The V6 engine makes this car a joy to drive. I love the alloy wheels and the design of the car. The bold look of the car is very sophisticated. I went into a store and bought a six foot long plant, to my suprised this fit in the inside of the car. I didn't need to use the trunk. Good gas mileage, smooth ride, nice design and reliable. Who could ask for more? Now I want the 2010!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car last summer and have had several problems ever since. The tires and its sensors have been going bad since day one. Had all sensors and tires replaced. At 16K miles, the AC compressor went out and busted the drive belt. Transmission leaks in the upper seal and gasket, which I took care of in my mechanic shop. Suspension was replaced on the left side due to a minor accident, but it's still not the same. I'm really disappointed with this vehicle. I've wasted a lot of time getting this car in and out of the shop. Both my parents have new Chevys and that's all we've owned. I guess I just got the bad one in the bunch.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was attracted to this car by the advertised fuel economy (32 highway), the exterior looks, and roomy trunk. I am very dissappointed in the fuel economy & performance. In reality it averages about 26-27 MPG on the highway. Also I find that the car is not very responsive & often I am flooring it to get enough pickup to pass on the highway. And worst of all, I am thinking of replacing it soon and it has lost mot of it's value. In fairness to the car, it has been very reliable and I feel it is built solid but it is not very fun to drive and I wouldn't recomend it to anyone who is looking for something more sporty.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car. It is comfortable, elegant interior, and the performance is excellent. My last three cars were Acura TL's (02 Type S, 04 and 05). I loved them but have had my eye on an Impala for awhile and decided to give it a try. I think this car compares equally well in just about every category. I miss the bluetooth of the TL, but the ride is much more comfortable. Not quite as sporty as the TL, but still fun to drive and the 3.9 engine performance is outstanding. MPG has be great. Average over 30 on the hwy and low 20's in town. Excellent for the size of the car. The car is an absolute pleasure and has restored my faith in GM. </TEXT>

I do not do a lot of highway driving, but a friend of mine has a 2008 Impala and he says he gets anywhere from 31-34 mpg on the highway with non ethanol gas. So far I have had no problems with this car.

<TEXT>The 2007 has lost of neat extras and they are mostly driver enhancements such as direction, mpg avg, mpg instant, temp outside, etc. I will be honest and say that I like the interior lay-out of my old 2003 Impala much better and this car seems smaller inside. But, I do like the steering wheel in the 2007 over the 2003 model, more comfy on the hands. The trunk is definitely smaller and does not have the back seat pull downs that allow access to the trunk or longer storage for those items that just don't quite fit in the trunk. The exterior of the 2007 is more sleek and sporty but I really like the look of my old 2003 better. The car is still amazing on mileage as I generally avg 30+ mpg. </TEXT>

The 3.9L engine has plenty of go. Wish that the interior had more space with smaller driver middle console and more rear foot room. Power seats really reduce the rear foot room. Have had several chips in the windshield, very odd. Re-circulation of cabin air now runs compressor hot or cold (same as air conditioner or defroster running) takes away fuel efficiency.

<TEXT>We owned 2005 Impala; loved the car. No trouble with it. Bought a 2007, was told it was a program car, later found it was titled to a rental car company. Since we bought it, we have had it in the shop 3 times for steering. The last time, they had to replace the gear box and pump. It has 35,000 miles so is barely under warranty. Apparently the steering cannot be fixed. Still steers okay sometimes, not okay others. Intermittently radio has no sound, you can turn station selector and change volume control. Service dept. can't duplicate. The heater has also done this, but not for the same length of time. Gas mileage is horrible and gets worse with each fill up. Down to 22 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased LT3 with 3.9. Thought it was a classy car and good value. Performance is more than adequate for V6 but mileage is very disapointing. Previous car was 03 Impala with 3.4 which would easily get over 30 mpg on highway with high of 37mpg. I have to drive my 07 LT3 carefully to get 24/25mpg on the highway. I would think that with the technology Chevrolet put into this car - cylinder deactivation and variable valve timing - the 3.9 engine would do far better. Even my old 3.8 litre cars got better mileage than the 3.9 engine. Road noise and wind noise are also excessive. Too bad they couldn't get it right. This could have been a great car. Sorry, but my 2003 Impala was better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>On the heels of 15k miles, this adequate vehicle continues to provide just enough to keep us positive about the purchase. Just some front axle noise and a/c fan whine remind us that at this price point you get some irritants. Tat's just how things seem to shake out with the domestics of our time. You know, you hear something weird and think about taking it in while under warranty but somehow know you will really be wasting your time and effort in doing so because the thing still goes in gear and drives. It's generally as good as new, getting 29.5 hwy. mpg, clips along good enough on trips. Not a stand out by any means but adequately comfortable/economical.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Impala LTZ is a solid value with good performance with the 3.9 V6, which comes from it's older brother the rock solid 3.8. Styling is nice inside and out, but I would think for the price Chevy would offer climate control, a coin holder and better outside mirrors. I opted for the LTZ over the SS, due in part to the tires are cheaper to replace, the V6 runs good enough for any need I will ever have.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have an ?06 Hemi Charger and an SS; the Charger is my spouse?s, and the SS was a replacement for a company car I had. I did not want another Charger, so I went looking for a conservative looking sedan I could take clients out in during the week, yet still have fun with on the weekends. I think the SS has satisfied both criteria. Notes for performance buffs: installing the $20 GM strut tower brace from a 1999 Buick Regal GS in both the front and back significantly reduces body roll. Second: Taking 20 minutes to swap the soft rubber upper motor mount bushing for a stiffer one will greatly reduce the driveline lash w/o sacrificing comfort. Third: you'll love the sound at wide open throttle! </TEXT>

I only gave the car a seven for build quality as after only six months the car began dripping transmission fluid. A trip to the dealer let us know the transmission casing needed to be replaced. The car was at the dealer for a week although they did provide a loaner. Other then that its holding up well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>OnStar, gas mileage, looks good, big trunk.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had a '60, '64SS '71 '77 '89 '95 and now an '07 Impala. I have it 10 months now and I have to say, I'm impressed. Sufficient power, comfortable front seats, road driving 32. In town, 26 average. Actually quieter than my '03 Mercury Marquis. Probably the best (mileage car) I have ever owned. By the way, I have a contact in Oshawa Canada where these are made and I am told the Impala quality control is strict and tight with constant inspections. It's not Grandpa's old big monster Impalas, but I am rolling with the times and this looks like a winner.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nice ride, great mileage. Power to carry four people around the mountains with no apparent strain</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a company car for me. I travel a lot and it's about 40% city mileage and 60% highway. I seldom drive over the posted speed limit and have been rewarded with hwy mileage as high as 36 MPG RT from Houston to New Orleans. Most trips 31-33 MPG I have had lots of different company cars and this one is the best ever. I've yet to find a convenient E85 station so it's been all regular gas, so far. Trunk is spacious. Flip and fold seats are great. Aux input for iPod is nice. No problems yet, with just over 30K 1st year. This car is a winner! 1st time I ever had a basic model that gets compliments about how good it looks from strangers. The best Impala ever! A keeper!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage, improved styling, Aux Jack for iPod, good performance, very comfortable seats for long trips, extra outlets for charging Blackberry, cell, etc. Smooth trunk interior for loading large suitcases or boxes without snagging/obstructing hinges. Great car for a salesman and small families.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I previously owned an 03 Impala and the 07 is a much better car. It has much more power and gets great mileage. The interior is great except for the faux wood trim. The exterior has nice lines and it is a sharp looking car. The flex fuel feature is neat, but E85 has mileage limitations. The traction control is improved and you don't notice when it engages like the 03. The rear seats fold down which is nice, the 03 that I owned did not have this feature. As soon as I took delivery, we drove from Chicago to DC. I had 4 adults and a child and everyone was quite comfortable. I love this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The additional features of the computer are nice: tire pressure readout, fuel range etc are great. The 07 gives you the ability to turn off the lights, while my 03 did not which was quite irritating. MP3 jack is a nice feature. The storage compartments under the rear seats are good to have.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2000 Corvette for this car and I am very pleased. I have had far fewer regrets about giving up the C5 because of the Impala's goodness. The Short Block V-8 sounds great and the car is extremely fast. It handles very well for a family sedan, and though it is not a Corvette, it is still a lot of fun to drive and is far easier to live with day-to- day without giving up all of the "fun factor". Pay attention to this one, if you want practical and sporty! I have a hard time remembering that it is a front drive car- very neutral compared to some other front drivers I've had, unless I really floor it hard from 0 mph. Build quality is excellent-no defects. Great Job Chevy!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Bose/XM sound system with iPod hookup and hands free cell hookup through OnStar is excellent. Excellent appearance.Clean, uncluttered design, in and out. The 5.3 engine runs and sounds great. You can not beat the sound of a short-block Chevy V-8!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great power--surprised me when I had to use it. 21mpg w/ a/c, 26-30 w/o. A little too much noise for me interior at 60+mph, but then depends on roadway-- why whine, huh?, but great traction, room for 3 in backseat, but a little cramped for 6 ft tall people--trunk not squared at backseat junction. Never used OnStar so far, so dunno if I need it yet. Controls well positioned, easy to operate. Have about 8K miles on it so far with only oil change and tire rotation--no other problems. When I go to dealership, always look in repair lot to 07 Impalas, very little there and customers I talk to are pleased w. their Impala's. When I reach 15K miles will write another review. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Reserve power available when needed. Leg room great for me and navigator. Gas mileage good (21 w/ a/c and 26+ w/o a/c, but am in Central Texas and need my a/c except in winter. Safety features are great as is sound system.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Very nice car for the money. Fast comfortable and better fuel economy than I would have expected. Combined fuel economy has been 19mpg..have gotten as high as 28.9mpg on the highway. Wanted to buy a Chrysler 300C but decided to keep the $10k in the bank. I have not had any problems with the car and would recommend an Impala to anyone. High praise from a Mopar buyer. For a front driver with a V8 the torque steer is not all that objectionable. I wanted to buy an American car and after 31000+ miles I am happy with my decision. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V8 is smooth, fairly fast and not real thirsty. Seats are very comfortable and seem to be wearing well. Good trunk space and I especially like the flip and fold rear seat. Very good radio....my son and daughter tell me so.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Very good car! Ethanol (E85) compatible with good miles per gallon. Spacious and quiet interior make this a joy to drive. Traction control and excellent crash safety ratings makes this a good all around car! Sleek and stylish exterior puts the competition to shame!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>E85 compatible. Remote start system. Traction control. Large interior and spacious trunk.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I both drive Impalas and the LTZ is our 7th Impala since 2000. By far, this LTZ is superior to all the others. Power, styling, comfort, Bose sound system (fantasic); overall a great car. Gas mileage, however, is a disappointing 22-23 mph no matter how it is driven. Although it has 233 hp, would expect better mileage. This car is loaded with every option, including the fire engine red tintcoat paint. The car turns heads; hopefully not the State trooper's (LOL). Have 8600+ miles on it since April 25 with no problems whatsoever. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I looked at lots of cars before chosing the Impala. Hondas and Toyota's don't stack up in the quality and solid feel when you close the doors. Auto insurance is also lower than buying foreign, I checked with insurance companies to help decide which car was the least expensive to own.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats and view. Power to spare even with the 3.5 V6 engine.</FAVORITE>

One long trip in my 3000 miles. First GM car in 30 years, having bought mostly Japanese. Test drove Camry, Accord, Saturn. This had the best ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After having a van for my last 3 vehicles and wanting to get back to a sedan, I had a decision to make. My final decision was the Chevrolet Impala LT2. After having the vehicle for 4 months, I have generally been very impressed in most phases. At this point I am very happy with the car. I rate it a 9 out of 10.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite feature is the remote starting of the car. In the hot Florida weather it is nice to start the car from a distance, and when getting into the car it has cooled because the air has come on in full mode. Very clever.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have been stranded twice with this vehicle. In both instances it was the security system that failed. It wouldn't allow the engine to start. Upon replacing the failed security system electronics, other electronics controlling the anti-lock brakes and tire pressure monitor subsequntly failed. Have problems with the front passenger's side suspension (rattles) that are still not resolved. Vehicle was at the dealer for repairs to the suspension issue when it was discovered that the steering rack and axles needed replacement (this occurred at around 12,000 miles). Mileage when using E-85 falls by about 35% but vehicle operates fine with this fuel. Average vehicle, nothing special</TEXT>

<TEXT>Expected better mileage on the highway. Window sticker shows 27, not even getting 20 as of right now. Engine wants to stall at stop lights with air on max. Water gets inside door frame when washing car, have to dry out inside of door frame. Sometimes there's lifter or valve rattling. Too much power for a front wheel drive vehicle, can get away on you if not careful. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the OnStar. Phone sound coming through the speakers is great, comes in when my cell phone drops out, shows call minutes left right on radio readout area. </FAVORITE>
