<TEXT>It's really a good car and all of a driving experience. I work home-office so do not use the car a lot - only 7,500 miles per year average, however, it is quite enjoyable to drive it every time I go the airport and go to pick up the kids at school.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fun to drive, great handling (for a SUV) with the 19" and sport package, a little rough riding at times though. Comfortable and decent fuel economy (premium fuel uhh). No issues to date, Nice sound system, nav is just ok, but the bluetooth rocks. An overlooked small SUV that competes very well all around, careful price jumps with options! Good Value if you buy 1 year old.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The BMW X3 is a perfect car for a person who likes performance, styling and great handling. Mine has the sports package and M styling and looks terrific. I had driven BMW 5 Series cars for 20 years, but needed occasional storage capacity to carry a drum set. I also have an X5 which is beautiful but it doesn't come anywhere near the X3 for performance and handling. The fit and finish is top notch with great features like the full length sunroof. I also enjoy the sitting position which is higher than a sedan but not so high that you sway with every bump like you do in most trucks and SUVs. One great car....</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a 2008 CR-V and simply was not happy with it. It is wonderfully versatile but it had no power, was noisy, had a rough ride at times and the seats were very uncomfortable. After 3 months I traded the Honda for a CPO X3 and I couldn't be happier. With the X3 I really have to watch my speed. The engine is silky smooth, its quiet, and feels solid as a rock. It may not be as roomy as the CR-V but I can definitely trade that for the joy of driving. If you are considering a small SUV think if you are buying it for yourself or for others. If you care about passenger comfort and versatility then the CR-V is a great choice. But if you want to have a smile on your face get an X3.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased my 2007 X3 with 24100 miles on it a little over a week ago. This is the best handling SUV I have driven. Lots of power from the 3.0L straight 6. Very comfortable seats. Stereo sound quality is excellent. Much better than my '04 330ci convertible. I tried the sport package on another X3 and the ride was too rough for my taste. The aesthetic updates for '07 look great. Bluetooth is not always clear, but works okay. Also, the throttle tip-in is a little touchy and takes some getting used to at low speed. I was looking for a small SUV that was fun to drive, this fits the bill nicely. The Japanese companies can't compete with German build quality, ride and handling</TEXT>

<TEXT>I guess I expected more from my first BMW. My wife hated the way it drove around town, so now it's mine. The transmission is definitely a design flaw and there should be a recall. On the highway it rides like a dream. It's like riding on a rail and it takes discipline to stay below 100 mph. I had a lifter noise and after several visits to service, they had to replace the cylinder head. That was another nightmare. The dealer and BMW should have made a better effort to compensate for my inconvenience. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Second BMW (first being M3). Purchased pre-owned. Love almost everything about it. Has just about every possible option and package. Love the 19" wheels. Did have to adjust driving some to accommodate for brake assist and trans system. Once I have done that, it is fine and very enjoyable to drive. Do not have problems others have mentioned. Just took a judicious right foot. Very comfy sport seats and great thick M-sport steering wheel. Now that we have a baby, it is perfect. Not my M3, but a good compromise for the time being. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been a BMW and Saab owner for the past 20 years, I have to say that after driving the X3 for the past year and a bit I am still very happy that I have it! I enjoy driving and I travel a lot, I go where it snows and where it's hot year round, I have found that this SAV performs well in most situations and is fun to drive. I have had very few problems and they were all minor ones. The auto transmission that I have operates differently in sport mode providing the burst of torque when you need it but I did not have issues with the transmission as noted by other reviewers. I have also noted that as more miles were driven the fuel economy has gone up close to the stated 26 MPG HWY.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Given that it is a sport activity vehicle it is fun to drive, I also like the premium sound system and would recommend it as an option as well as the xenon active headlights, the active steering option and the upgraded leather seats, I travel a lot and this option was very worth while.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought this vehicle used as I could not afford new. Unfortunately previous owner never serviced vehicle. Had to take into local BMW dealer 4x before we got the throttle response issue cleared. Car hesitated and bucked, was scared to be in traffic when I needed quick acceleration. But the warranty is awesome, treated like a queen at dealership given loaner each time, who still does that? No other automaker I know of. Computer need to be defragged and re-booted so we could start fresh. It worked, my little baby is performing fantastic and I love driving it, it truly is a driving experience like the ads say!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second x3, the 1st a 2004 so I expected a better BMW but what I got was what others are complaining about: poor shifting patterns at speeds under 40 mph. Has been in the shop for software fixes but no improvements and the techs tell me they don't notice the problem. The sport drive is horrible and this is called a "sport utility vehicle". This is not what I expected from BMW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Driving along a back country road and slump. The transmission felt like it dropped out the bottom. It left me stranded since when I turned it back on it refused to recognize reverse, drive, any gear whatsoever. Since then I have had a "software update" and it is still extremely sluggish in first gear and before I know it I am in third at a snail pace. Highway driving is excellent but in traffic a nightmare, and unreliable shifting. I was told this is a worldwide problem by my dealer regarding X3 transmissions and although this is happening to several X3's it is not large enough to recall. There needs to be a recall. Lurching and shifting so hard that it bucks is not acceptable for a BMW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our 3rd X3, and I loved the other two, both 2005s. This seems to be a different vehicle. Same great finish and handling, but awful acceleration. As written elsewhere, it is bothersome and dangerous. I loved the responsive, fun to drive qualities of our other X3s. This one makes me scared to enter the highway. Not so fun. Once you get past 40, it is fine, but getting there can be tough. Sometimes you punch it and boom, other times you count to three before anything happens. Someone is going to get into an accident because of this. We went to the dealer and they tried a software fix, but it only made it marginally better and we seem to have lost 1-2 MPG. Disappointing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>There is a lot of complaining about the automatic transmission version of this machine. I bought an x3 manual with 6000 miles on it in February 2008 and have put 8000 miles on it since then. This is a great vehicle if you like driving. Fantastic low-end torque. Great acceleration in 2nd, 3rd and 4th. 5th and 6 are highway overdrives. Corners flat in aggressive driving. Have never had better brakes. Pulls a utility trailer loaded with stuff for the dump like its not there. I was skeptical about BMW reliability. No issues so far and the 100,000 mile warranty should have me covered. It doesn't have all the cup holders and storage that a Japanese vehicle has... drives much better though.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine! This thing wants to be revved and driven. Handling is great. AWD is better in Vermont winters than a 2003 Land Cruiser and 2006 Honda Ridgeline, both sold. Performs great in all weather conditions. Passes cars on highway like they are standing still, like a four cylinder liter bike.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I finally had enough. Took a major loss by trading in the 2007 X3. Bought the car for 43K and got 29K in trade in ! The transmission problem in my opinion is dangerous and makes the car unpredictable in many situations (turns, acceleration from stop). Although I brought it back to the dealer for the fix, the problem persisted. In my opinion, it is a disgrace that BMW has the audacity to label this thing the "ultimate driving machine". I have been permanently soured by the BMW brand. Goodbye !</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this car for my wife who was reluctant to own since she doesn't like the tight, sports car like ride. She prefers the soft, floating on air feel. Well, it's mine now. The X3 has a lot of get up and go, and you just have to breathe on the brakes to stop the vehicle. On the highway, you need self-control to keep it under 100 mph. It's like riding on a rail. However, around town in stop and go traffic, it is not smooth acceleration and shifting. It lurches off the line and then quickly starts upshifting. It's what my wife did not like about it, and I have to agree. All things considered, it is an awesome vehicle and has a real class aura about it. I highly recommend it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Transmission shifting issues - shifts so jerky it will actually make me car sick. Have had back to dealer 2x for updates, shifting improved, but not even close to acceptable for any vehicle, but this one is $40k+. Dealer told me fix is to shift manually - no thanks, I didn't buy a stick shift. Live in western PA, lots of hills, car will not shift out of 2nd gear starting up a hill unless speed exceeds 25 mph - that's about 3500 rpm. When you take your foot off the gas, it throws you like hitting the brakes! Terrible engineering from a premier automotive company.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this as an American Spec X3 in Germany with the Manual 6-speed and most options; a superb driving machine. For an AWD and SUV like vehicle, it does very well on gas mileage - getting 25 hwy and 20 city, and that is at 90 mph on German Autobahns. The vehicle handles very well and the steering is outstanding. I think the 6-speed manual is key to driving pleasure and better mileage (contrary to specs) - but could not imagine using in city traffic and most state side driving stop and go conditions.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my x3 in 12/06. My first Bimmer! The third time I drove it, it quit on me. It was in the shop 9 days to re-program a computer problem. The hesitation problem others list is a perfect description of my x3. Sometimes, the hesitation has absolutely scared me. I have had a sidelight casing replaced due to moisture, have an obvious rattle from the sunroof cover and have had the lifters clacking since I bought the car. Today, I am headed to the dealer to attempt to negotiate my way out of this car into another. The only reason I'm going back to BMW is because of the known problems and my chances of recouping some of the losses on it. Do not recommend this car to anyone.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle to be both fun and utility vehicle. The transmission behaves so erratically it is downright dangerous. On more than several occasions its lack of response has cause near fatal accidents. It typically hesitates between 2-3 gear which is where you are at when entering a turn-about or merging into traffic quickly. The sports drive mode down shifts so hard that you swear you have been "rear-ended" by another driver. BMWNA has tried to pass this off as part of the "adaptive" or learning features of this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>There is definite hesitation when attempting quick acceleration. The gps is horrendous! Neither my husband nor myself have figured out how to enter addresses.

<TEXT>Original impression of X3 3.0si on test drive was quite positive. I purchased a certified X3 3.0si with 12K miles. Car handles well and has powerful engine. Transmission is erratic at best. Sometimes does not engage at all, others shifts very hard and can cause nausea in passengers. BMW service can't find issue which suggests that they have not figured out optimal transmission match to the 3.0si engine in the X3.</TEXT>

A very few, very minor issues: oddly placed cupholder on passenger side, for example. But have experienced none of the transmission problems others complain of, and the overall quality is high. This replaced an Acura TL. I liked the TL a lot, but like the X3 better. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is, without question, the best automobile I've ever owned. It is powerful, responsive, agile for its size/weight and BMW's N52 straight-6 engine is buttery smooth and quiet. (Although one doesn't hear it inside the vehicle, from outside the vehicle the X3's exhaust note has a nice bit of a growl.) I opted for the 6-speed manual transmission, and I must say it takes a bit of getting used to. The clutch pedal has a lot of "travel" in it, but the engagement point is a fairly narrow area quite near to where the clutch pedal is in its undepressed state. I'm impressed with the fit and finish of the vehicle and it just has a nice, solid feel to it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the memory-adjustable sport seats. The most comfortable and supportive car seats I've ever felt. The computer function, which lets one cycle through: (a) avg. MPH; (b) avg. MPG; (c) outside temp.; (d) time; and (e) cruising range remaining, is quite helpful.</FAVORITE>

This is my first small SUV, I am a car guy but I travel where there is snow a few times every year and I wanted to be able to take something on my trips that would drive like a car but be able to take the weather with no worries. I think I found my vehicle, The handling on the X3 is great and I don't find the suspension too stiff, I did not order the sport package. My X3 was ordered with the luxury package, the 18" wheels; front seat warmers; servo-tronic steering; upgraded radio and xenon headlights. So far I am very satisfied with this X3, I look forward to every drive, every day. My advice is to go and test drive one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I used to be very much against SUVs. I had a purchase and sales agreement all drawn up for a BMW 3 wagon, and then at the last minute I asked the sales person to let me drive a 2007 BMW X3 in a 6 speed manual. WOW, I was 100% sold. Coming out of a Volvo V70 T5 wagon, I needed the practicality of a wagon to haul items for my business. The 3 wagon did this job but was a bit tight. The X3 had more room without sacrificing anything in performance. So far the experience with the vehicle and BMW have been nothing less than superb. Sure, it is not a cheap drive, but the fit, finish is unbelievable. I am getting 23-24 around town and 27 mpg on the highway. I HIGHLY recommend the 6 speed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my new X3 a week ago and it is a total nightmare. I did not know that there was a major engine hesitation with many of these vehicles, and mine is very bad and even dangerous. The steering is not aligned due to either a wheel alignment issue or the wheel itself is not centered. The controls including the navigation system are way too complex and awkward, and using knobs to control everything is absurd. My car has cosmetic defects on the fabric on doors and pillars, and it looks like they totally left out the quality in this SUV. Overall, should have got the RDX.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased an '07 X3 for my wife six months ago and we couldn't be happier. City parallel parking made short body length important factor. Ultimately we chose between the Acura RDX and the X3. This '07 X3 had a far superior engine compared to the '05 and '06 versions that we test drove. In fact, the older engines disappointed quite a bit. This vehicle handles like a 330. The AWD was flawless over the New England winter. Mileage is good for an SUV. The ride is just a touch stiff, but much softer than my M3 on city roads, and overall its a joy to drive. Storage is far better than a sedan. Reliability has been perfect. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was hesitant while buying this car after testing both Acura SUVs, Lexus RX, Mercedes ML, Missan Murano, Infiniti FX, Porsche Cayenne and Audi Q7 and it performed the best. The only thing I disliked about the car is the limited availability. I live in Maryand and the closest I could find was in Virginia, 400 miles away from my dealer. I got the sport package and love it. The seats are more supportive than anything. One thing I would recommend on the car is getting a warranty on your tires. I got a nail in my tire after 1200 miles. It was a $450 tire. Luckily I got it insured. One thing that BMW never has gotten right on any car they have made is cupholders.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We had a 325xi wagon for the past three years and really enjoyed it. We were not sure that we were going to get another BMW because we wanted to save some money on the payments. So we went and drove a ton of cars and decided that we liked what BMW had to offer in either a new 325 wagon or an X3. The X3 had the best pricing incentives for a lease so we went with it. The car is a base model with auto trans. It handles like a BMW. We like the leatherette for clean up and comfort. The radio could be better for the price. The DTC is miserable. We turn it off all the time. It makes the car hunt around in 1st and 2nd gear trying to avoid losing traction. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The interior is well appointed and everything is within easy reach. I'm a little disappointed on the sound system, I was told by my BMW rep that iPod connectivity was standard. It does have a port, but you pay extra for the integrated cable for control on the sound system, the speakers really aren't all that, my jeep grand cherokee was better in that aspect. I have only had it 4 days, but I just love it otherwise. I look for excuses to go for a drive, the gas mileage seems to be ok except when you get on the gas hard, tranny seems rough. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Huge sunroof, power, handling, 6speed auto with manual option is loads of fun. Loads of leg room, comfortable seats, Love the auto up/down windows. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>BMW's European delivery program is one of the best. Our car was waiting in Munich with a tank full of gas and ready for our trip across Germany, Switzerland and France. Our X3 performed flawlessly over international roadways and narrow back streets. We enjoyed traveling 1500 miles before leaving the vehicle in Nice, FR for shipment to the USA.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sliding down an icy North Cascades highway convinced me skid control is paramount consideration. U.S. safety standards are based on crash tests. By then it's too late! BMW's all-wheel drive with automatic traction and stability control makes it one of the safest cars on the road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT> I just bought a 2007 BMW X3. I test drove a different one, then took the one off the showroom floor in the color I wanted. I did not notice hesitation on test drive, but immediately noticed on mine. It is a week old and I hate it. Not to mention the stupid plastic handle that my knee constantly hits. The hesitation is horrible. It does it from a dead stop, and while driving at slow speeds. It is unacceptable to me-I want to return it. The transmission is so erratic, that passengers complain about the rough and jolty ride-it is embarrasing to tell them I spent so much on a piece of junk. I think I made a mistake. This is going to be my last BMW. I should have bought the Nissan Murano! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Okay, I have myself to blame. I buy a new car every two years, last one was a 2004 Acura TL--not the most expensive car I've owned, but far and away the best car in every category. I read the reviews for BMW X3 and know the car was not higly thought of in the past--but that 2007 was a NEW year with many improvements. The gas mileage is bad! 18mpg city/highway. The tranny is rough, and at low RPM there is almost zero torque and a rough go until about 25mph. The electronics are less than high tech--the radio is pathetic for a $44k vehicle--and the rear seats, despite what the catalogue said, do not fold flat, making the rear space useless for boxes, dogs, and anything else. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I drug my husband to test drive the Lexus Hybrid SUV, he drug me to test drive the X3. On paper I really thought we would like the Lexus better, but the X3 won hands down. Easier to turn into a parking space, felt roomier in the front, so much fun to drive. I'm only 5'4" but felt I could see out of the X3 better and with more personal space. Now my husband and I are at odds over who gets to drive the SUV (it's MINE). Who would have thought?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The feel of it driving - I really feel the road without sacrificing comfort. It's like driving a sportscar that has room for my family & my stuff (I'm a Realtor & have lots of stuff).

<TEXT>Just completed my first commute in my new '07 X3 - it turned the twisty mountain roads into a flat, straight freeway! The V6 is very quick & smooth, handling is fantastic and up/down shifts by the 6 speed auto trans were imperceptible. The brakes are almost too good, as I am learning to be very gentle with the brake pedal to avoid stopping too fast. Looked at CX-7, RDX, RAV4, CR-V & Edge - the X3 was far and away the most fun to drive while getting better mpg than CX-7, RDX & Edge and only 2 highway mpg less than Rav4 & CR-V AWD. Storage room with back seats up or down was equal or larger than these other CUV options. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, acceleration, fun to drive, reasonable mpg, awesome brakes, hands free Bluetooth phone, NAV/sound system, solid build quality, the extra large sun roof, adaptive headlights, park distance control, 4 years free service - and absolutely check out the "Comfort Seats" option for long trips! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great vehicle dynamics; silky smooth transmission; good trunk space; switched from FX 35 which was a great car. Has less interior storage compartments than FX 35. Nowhere near the interior quality of the FX. My X3 has a sticker price of 44k and can you belive in that price is not even a car alarm included. But what is bothering me is those very cheap controls on the radio as well as steering wheel. The radio control button is awful! BMW please! I also miss that beautiful vehicle information screen. Sound system just ok. Car has a little wind noise at speeds above 55 mph. City mileage 18-19 mpg. Highway 24-25 mpg so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I always said I would NEVER drive an SUV! I'm not. I'm driving an X3 and it's probably the most fun and convenient car I've ever owned. Normally those two words can't be used in the same sentence when describing a car. I'm disappointed in the gas mileage but other BMW owners seem to be fine with it. The interior is divine!

<TEXT>This is my second X3. Traded in a 2005. This is one of the best handling cars/SAVs out there. You just can not do better then the X-drive system. Get the 18" wheels and Premium Pkge. The Xenon headlamps are great. I get 19 to 20 mpg driving to work, but if you drive around 70 mph you won't get 26 mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the X3 in Germany and have had the pleasure of driving 100+ mph on the autobahn for the last 3 months... sooo fun!! Handles like a dream, both in snow and on dry pavement. Steering is quick and responsive. The inside is roomy and quite comfortable. The size is perfect... large enough to pack everything I need and more, yet small enough that parking (even in Germany) is no problem. I didn't get the navigation system because I already had a Tomtom. I ordered a side dash mount from ProClip so the GPS doesn't take up space on the windscreen and the placement is excellent. Top quality vehicle!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats that heat FAST. Large sun/moon roof is fantastic. Bluetooth works flawlessly. Park-distance-control is a real joy. There are a lot of little extras you can program into the computer (like having the blinker only blink 3 times when changing lanes).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Time to downsize from Lincoln Aviator. '07 X3 is perfect size and 1/3 less to fill gas tank. Fun to drive, agile, smooth and quick. Interior disappointing. Have an '07 BMW 328xi and expected equivalent interior comfort features on X3 but BMW did not provide them: (1) heat/AC system is not dual, has no vent in rear seat, and no heat circulation when engine off; (2) leather/comfort of sport seats inferior to 3 series; (3) radio Bluetooth features are limited compared to 3 series; (4) heated seats weak. The iPod add-on connection is awful - can't hook-up while driving, shows "Track #" not song name, cord too short, takes glove compartment space - use standard auxiliary. Park assist feature annoying.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this for my wife who is very difficult to please and was coming out of a 5 series wagon. This vehicle does everything well and even she is impressed. Most vehicles that are this much fun to drive are not at all practical, but this vehicle does it all. Everything about it is top quality. If you drive it, you will want to buy it. Don't bother with the sports package. The standard seats are more comfortable, and the standard front facia is much better looking.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This one has it all, styling, handling, utility, safety and everything you would expect from BMW. I thought it was too overpriced until I drove it. It is but it is such a wonderful vehicle I thought I would give it a try and was amazed at the lease payments because the residual value is so high. I don't think you could find a better small SUV or SAV, as BMW dubs it. I love the size, it's agile and offers utility. It's definitely a sport ute!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a really loaded 2007 X3. It's an unbelievable machine. I buy new cars very frequently and have gotten kind of bored with them. The X3 has given me that teenage excitement of having a car again. I really enjoy driving it. Its acceleration, handling and braking are just awesome. All of the latest safety features are in it. The fit and finish are top notch. The leather interior is beautiful. The transmission can be used in regular automatic drive, sport drive and manual. Hands free communication and BMW assist are very convenient. The BMW is in a class by itself. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The title of my review says it all about the 2007 X3. The exterior styling is just amazing. I can't tell you how many people have come up to me after seeing the X3 and said to me "hot car" or some variation of that. And it's an SUV!! Performance is excellent, you really need to hold this baby back on the roads. The new 260 hp engine is just perfect. Handling is incredible too. The interior is upgraded and beautiful. You really feel molded to the seats, they are so comfortable. The X3 just exudes class in every way. You just feel so great sitting in it, and driving it is just plain fun.</TEXT>
