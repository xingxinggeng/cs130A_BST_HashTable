<TEXT>I just purchase my first BMW (2007 550i) I test drove the 528 and did not like the lack of power. The 550i is a BEAST and is a dream to drive, I can't stay home, I take the longest way home and the acceleration is orgasmic. I will never drive another car other than a BMW. Worth every penny. Not sure what my gas mileage will be yet, but so far not bad for a V8 engine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow - what fun to drive. I wish I had the extra power of the 550 or the 535, but this car has it when you need it. I like to drive it in Drive Sport as it really hugs the road, and gives me the extra boost of speed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought my Certified Pre-Owned with 18K miles. Mileage is only mentioned a few times in the reviews, so I thought I would confirm the reports of excellent mileage ... I'm getting 24.5 to 25.5 around the Wash DC beltway, about 70/30 highway/streets. I'm looking forward to a road trip to confirm the high highway reports. The comfort of the seats is also amazing. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Best car I have ever owned and truly a pleasure to drive. I commute 100 round trip daily and I look forward to driving this car even after 3 years and 55k miles. Corners like a dream, gets up and goes fast enough but keeps you out of trouble. I have every option available except the night vision and active cruise control. You must have the sports package as the looks and performance can't be matched. Bought this car new with only 3 miles on it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is really a great car. It has so many features - even after having it for a couple of months, I'm still finding new features all the time. I just found that there are 2 compartments in the arm-rest. I've been told the lower compartment is to keep drinks cool. This car drives great, is very comfortable and smooth, and with all it's function, it looks great too. I've driven a 3 series before but with 2 kids and car seats, the 5 series is definitely the right size.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got a CPO with 28K miles. Drives like a dream. I opted for the sport pkg with no regrets. The only glaring disappointment was the Logic 7 Sound system which leaves a lot to be desired. My Civic SI factory upgrade system was better! For a lux car that retails for 60k new the Logics 7 system should rival Acura but falls far short on fidelity plus a boomy bass. Too bad for such a quiet car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>There is much to like about this car. Performance, styling, and reliability. It also seems to maintain value. There are some frustrating features on the car - the iDrive takes some getting used to. Something that should be simple, like tuning the radio, switching from CD to radio, even the climate control, has been (in my opinion) over-engineered. Often multiple steps are required to perform a function that could be more easily done with the turn of a knob. The sun roof is very noisy (after the sale, the rep. said all 5-Series have excessive wind noise when closed). I usually just keep the interior cover closed to avoid the noise. Interior cabin storage is non-existent, but the trunk is large.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2007 530i new 2 years ago; I traded my 2004 530i in when I reached 45K miles. I have not been disappointed with either of these cars! The handling, comfort and power are great. I test drove a 2004 525 when I was first looking because the dealer had one with the Sport Package but I chose the larger engine and didn't regret my choice. The 50K no charge warranty is great but honestly, the dealer makes things up so they can fix my car, e.g., change the wiper blades, etc; I have not had any real issues with my cars.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought this car about two weeks ago and I love it. Just a beautiful car. Drove Hondas and Toyotas before and no comparison. I can see why people stay with BMW. The car just feels well put together. It feels solid on the road. I got the sport package and I like the wheels and seats that come with it. Great handling and acceleration although there is a little lag when you punch it which probably wouldn't be an issue with the V8. Fuel economy, however, is very good for this type of car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car last year, so far it has only been back to the dealer for the free maintenance. I live in snowy Canada so a car that handles well in snowy weather is important, this car was absolutely exceptional last year. Performance, balance and handling are superb. The xi add on is well worth it. Last winter was a very heavy snowfall winter and I drove the car without snows, it drove like it was on rails, some of the roads were unplowed, slippery, and the car handled it without a problem, it gives you a great feeling of safety and it has not let me down yet. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned 5 other BMWs including a 7 series. This is the best one I have had from an all around driving experience. The 6 cylinder has outstanding acceleration, not much different from the 550 I test drove. Gas economy is amazing for this kind of car. Handling is fantastic and overall ride is close to perfect. I convinced my 82 year old dad to buy one and he now feels the same way</TEXT>

<TEXT>When you drive this BMW, you know that a great deal of effort went into every facet of the automobile. The way each sound the reaches your ears and the car reacts to bumps and especially the way it drives down the road. I've had this car for about 18 months and 16,000 miles. Each mile is a pleasure, and every drive is too short. X-drive is great in snow and rain, i-drive is still revealing new functions but works well for me, but the standard radio is just ok. Standard seats are comfortable for hours on end. Highway driving is smooth and quiet, very easy to cruise at high speeds. I've leased this car and really do not want to ever give it back. Just do it, you only live once.</TEXT>

<FAVORITE>Though just about every single magazine hates the iDrive, I am very happy with it. There are a lot of things that can still be improved but I think it is very user friendly. If you know how to write your name, you shouldn't have a problem with it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Sadly our first BMW only went 20K before being involved in a driver's front end collision last week. Damage was so severe the car was totaled. It did its job however as the front, door and side curtain air bags all deployed and kept the wife protected with no major issues. BMW Assist was calling the car within seconds of the accident as well as calling the police. Overall it was a well built car and we had no major problems with it. The brake issue I mentioned in my previous posting never returned. We are now looking at an 08 528i or 535i with the turbo. The 07 held its value fairly well. In the 18 months we owned the car the value dropped 28% </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought my first BMW (530i w/Sport Package and navigation) one month ago to get style plus sporty performance. Had driven Nissan Maximas for prior 12+ years. This car has delivered as I'm inventing reasons to take the long way home. Went on a 300+ mile trip and it was extremely comfortable. Interior build quality, mechanical and electronic performance is very solid. The sport package with 18" low profile tires is a must as it really sets off the look and you get added handling. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Black Sapphire Metallic paint; steptronic transmission with sport and manual mode; 18" tires and wheels; great handling; comfortable seats; front and rear park distance control; voice activated phone and navigation; Logic 7 sound system.

<TEXT>Overall the car is great. This was our first BMW. Nice looks, nice interior comforts. Very nice leather. My only complaint so far is with the brakes. An annoying squeak develops when the front brakes get the slightest amount of dust on them. I did not expect this from a $50K car. Also, when I have the steering wheel and seat in a position I like, I cannot see the upper portion of the speedometer We are happy with the car. The ride is amazing. At high speeds in the rain it handles very well. Recently got a road force balance on the tires and that made the ride much better We purchased the car in black. I would not own another in black. Hard to keep clean.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather interior. Sleek looks. Good visibility out all windows. I especially like the 6 speed steptronic and use it all the time. Wife opts for normal automatic tranny mode.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Over the years I've owned many BMW products; 7s, 5s, X5s, 2002 and on and on. None of them can match this particular car; it is truly incredible. At first I was not sure about the "Bangle" styling but I have to admit that as the car has aged it has really grown on me and I now love the styling. It will run with a Porsche 911 without problem, and on a cruise from Florida to Michigan it was superb. The car is almost a year old and has never had a single problem nor been back to the dealership. To quote Lee Iacocca "if you can find a better car buy it!"</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car after owning other luxury cars. It outranks the others by far. The handling and solid ride speaks volumes. The downside is it is so smooth on the open road, you have to watch the speed - it is moving faster than it feels. Quality and handling along with style. One small issue is that the cup holder needs to be re-designed, it's not in a good place. I am totally sold, all my cars in the future will be BMW. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a long term Audi owner (have had six), who decided to look around when they dropped the free maintenance. I test drove the new Audi A6 wagon and the BMW 530xiT. The BMW did just about everything better than the Audi and the monthly lease rate was better. The choice was a no-brainer! The 530xiT ride and handling are first rate, as is the build quality. The engine is exceptionaly smooth but could use a bit more low end torque. Winter performance, especially with snow tires, is exceptional. The iDrive is not as scary as expected but could be better. I like my BMW so much that we replaced my wife's Audi with a BMW 530xiT too! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 9th BMW and I am pleased that BMWs have not lost their edge. Great handling, adequate power (I miss the torque from the MB E500 I had), very good build quality. The car is a roomy 4 door sports car. The 255 BHP 6 is good but torque is a little low and you tend to be aware that the 6 speed auto is being used rather a lot. I get a little hesitation when I make a sudden demand for acceleration which can be a little disconcerting. Sports package worth the money for the contour seats alone. They are the most comfortable seats in the business. Fuel economy is excellent. Superb car worthy of the BMW name. Just annoyed that BMW introduced the 300 BHP engine just after I purchased my car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Its been over 12 years since my last bimmer. There's lots of new technology, but most importantly the fun-to-drive factor is still there. Adequate power from the 215hp, very comfortable ride, solid feeling car. Only two disappointments are the Nav and interior storage. Severely outdated and lacking basic function of search-by-name. Who decided to leave this out? Interior storage is minimal. Space in center armrest is laughable. Those gripes aside this is a great car.</TEXT>

Unlike the Lexus GS 350, this car has a real trunk, way more fun to drive than anything in its price range.

Let's start with peace of mind with BMW's bumper to bumper warranty, smooth transmission, more than ample power (367 hp!!), luxurious interior & amenities, iDrive is not bad once you get use to it, bluetooth, nav display is wide & split screen for other features, tons of improvement from prior models, too much to list, running out of space.

<TEXT>I've had the 2007 530i with manual transmission for about a month. What a great car! Test drove the automatic but it wasn't quite as fun to drive. The handling, ride quality, and acceleration simply brings a huge smile on my face. Like other reviewers, I always take the long way home. I have owned Lexus and Volvo and there is no comparison. This is truly a driver's car. If you really enjoy driving, this is your car. Also, I am averaging 28.5 mpg combined driving (another plus for getting the manual transmission).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned several Mercedes and thought I would never switch. I went to get another Mercedes and their emphasis on cost cutting is apparent. I drove the 530xi and was blown away. Interior appointments are outstanding, fit and finish exceptional and the driving experience is beyond compare. This car is absolutely dead stable (and nearly silent) at 130 mph with amazing handling even in heavy rain. You can get an E-Class Mercedes for less, but there is just no comparison. The 530xi is worth the few extra bucks - it is clear that this is still a pure German built vehicle (like Porsche). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Premium stereo is mind-blowing and the navigation with real-time traffic is outstanding and a huge time saver.

<TEXT>Picked up in Munich, and hit the Autobahn; although keeping break-in RPMs below 4,500, was still able to enjoy high speed cruising. Ended in Naples with 1250 miles a week later. Delivered to USA in early November. Currently 6,500 miles and enjoying more every day. This is a unique car, after driving 1995 Audi S6 for ten years, 175,000 miles, this car had to please me alot. So far, it has delivered. No real issues, although iDrive technology learning curve is initially steep. Mounted snow tires on new wheels to blast around this winter, and can't wait to return to summer driving conditions. Likely the best ride for the sporty minded sedan generation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 550i just a few weeks ago, and what an incredible ride that car, let me tell you. Not only is it POWERFUL, putting you back in your seat, but it stops on a dime. Having a "racing" background I can tell you that you need to get the 5 series for its handling and power delivery. Everything else, just about is a plus. The monster power in the 550i is invigorating! Have fun! Please just make sure that the Homelink garage door opener works before you drive it off the dealer.

<TEXT>The car is wonderful! I picked it up in Munich as part of BMW's European Delivery Program and subsequently drove it 1,000 miles on the Autobahn throughout Germany and Austria this past December. It cruises at 130 mph just as easily as it does at 65 or 70 mph. It is actually more comfortable to drive at higher speeds. As with my past BMW, it has a tendancy to want to pull you faster down the road - like a race horse always wanting to go ever faster - be careful to keep an eye on the speedometer! The interior is very nicely appointed and well equipped. The iDrive is not as cumbersome as others have claimed. I think the iDrive becomes an issue for those drivers who are not tech savvy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The iDrive is not difficult to operate if you own either a Blackberry or Palm Treo - they operate under the same general principle. The navigation system is a must! Nav system also allows for voice recognition. Definitely opt for the split fold down rear seats to compliment the already huge trunk!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this 530i to replace another luxury sedan. Riding in the 530i is incomparable, you feel like a billion bucks, well at least a million. Go compare a test drive with other luxury autos, you'll feel the difference. In the end, all else is just not a BMW and you get what you pay for.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The iDrive is easy once you get the hang of it - slight lag time. Navigation is great. The sports package sets the car off with the 18" rims and lower profile run flat tires. Braking is excellent and you just feel safe in this car with its cage construction. The car just looks sporty and classy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Now in the shop for the fourth time to fix the (apparently) unfixable Sirius satellite radio; entire radio failed once; engine valve clatter and transmission "clunk" is annoying, but not yet troublesome. Great car otherwise, but clearly not up to manufacturing and reliability standards of Lexus, Acura and the other "Pacific Rim" manufacturers whose cars I have owned in the past. Even more troubelsome than the two Mercedes we recently owned. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first BMW I have bought. The car looks and rides better then any of the other cars I have owned (12) over the past 25 years. It may be a little high for most budgets but you will not be disapointed. Worth every penny. I only got Aust and had to have the navigation.

<TEXT>Having owned an E430 4-matic and Audi A8L prior to this, I'm getting used to the smaller car. The iDrive system is terrible compared to MMI of Audi. Acceleration is a bit slow but handling is awesome in all weather conditions. Interior finish is a bit 'cheap' with too much vinyl and tacky plastic buttons for this price-point! Fold down rear seats, Bluetooth and headup display are nice features. Getting 19-20 mpgs driving around northern NJ. I look forward to 7- series xi next time. </TEXT>

Only downside thus far is Nav System - I found the maps to be outdated when compared with my Garmin C330 GPS - interestingly both BMW and Garmin get their maps from the same source (Navteq). Hoping a new and better map will come along soon. This is a peppy and fun car to drive. Can't wait to test the AWD in the winter. Highly recommend the stick shift.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Exceeds my expectations! I do a lot of highway driving. Averaging over 29 MPG with about 20 on the local roads. This car is not only fast but comfortable as well. I focused on getting the colors I wanted (Monoco Blue and beige interior). I did not want nor bought all the extras; just the winter package and navigation. This car can zoom when I need the speed to pass. Cruising is awesome with navigation and the standard sound system which is excellent. The dealer did a great job on the pre-sale and delivery and what's wrong with 4 years of free maintenance. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>BMW handling and the power of the 4.8L V-8. No doubt the 360 Horsepower and torque (3,400 rpms) standout over the competition. This car is only slightly less powerful than the prior version of the M5. There are many standard features, e.g. bi-Xenon, Dakota leather, etc. so options desired are few.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought the 550i after looking around for a few months. I wanted the performance but I was concerned about the fuel economy. If you can believe the gauge on the car, I am getting 28.6 MPG on the highway. It is only rated at 25, so that is excellent. When I fill it up again I will verify that number. This car is a pleasure to drive. It's quick, quiet, and comfortable. Sport package not necessary. Automatic is best for most. There is a 1300 dollar gas guzzler tax on the stick shift. </TEXT>

I continue to love the exterior design. The extra hp in the 2007 is noticeable. The stereo upgrade was worth it. The rear sunshades are a real nice, classy touch. The Monaco Blue is a deep rich blue. The Bridgestone run-flats in the 2007 are a MAJOR improvement over the Dunlop run-flats in the 2004. Did not get active steering on the 2007 - more turns of the wheel but better feel for the road. Still getting used to the comfort seats (standard on 2007 SP) but I think I will like them better than sport seats on 2004.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is solid but the front seat is a bit deep and the back of your legs at the knee will touch the seat and forces you to slouch forward for clearance or inflate the lumbar support feature to move you forward and clear the behind the knee issues. You see, for a 5'7" adult like me and my wife is 5 foot even the rear seats are too deep and makes small adult legs float and not reach the carpet which makes your legs numb after awhile. But the car is solid handler so it washes out. </TEXT>
