<TEXT>Purcheased an 07 AWD with 24K miles from an individual, next day the engine light was on. My auto tech son put on scanner and in 5 min said it had a bad catalytic converter. Vehicle still under warranty so took it to a dealer in Denver area next day. Their highly trained techs took two and a half hrs and diagnosed catalytic converter needed replaced. Ordered parts and need to go back to fix...sometime. Dealer rep had a real unpleasant attitude. Only experienced this once before, also with a GM product (03 Pontiac). Swore I would never buy another GM product...should have learned my lesson previouly and stayed away from GM related items also. Will I ever learn??? </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Like styling, room and performance. Just took a 120 mile trip to mountains with 5 grandkids. Had enoug HP and torque to pull the mountain passes smoothly and we were all very comfotable, averaged 23mpg. Pretty good for this size vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Car horn stops working every time I go to car wash. Stereo/DVD replaced twice first year and a half. When stereo/DVD goes, turn signals stop working. I drive from gas station to gas station. Gas mileage is probably worst in class. Will stick with Nissans and Hondas in future.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>More Disappointed</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>My previous post "Disappointed on 08/14/2007" describes our early issues. Since then, catalytic convert changed, in shop 3-4 times because of engine shutting off in traffic, engine light on sporadically, engine stumbles sporadically, fuel gauge acting up, passenger dashboard airbag panel cracking. Everything in this vehicle is controlled by the computer, fuel, timing, transmission, etc. I have asked the dealer several times to please replace it. They "Will not replace one unless a catastrophic failure occurs." Overall hatred for this vehicle and frustration of trying to get it fixed has made ownership of another Suzuki product impossible. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We were naive when we purchased the Suzuki. We liked the power and style. Then, just months later with 7,000 miles things started to go wrong. It started rattling, the suspension dilapidated, the car's computer died, the power steering died. Now in September 2009, it has 66,000 miles and looks and drives like its 20 years old. Now it is only worth $6,500 and we have become upside down on the car. Overall, I think this is the worst car in the world. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my XL7 with approx 70 miles on it. First couple of months it was back at the dealers for repairs, spent more time there than with me. Then, going over a bridge and it sounded like a gun went off in the cab! The airbag on the passenger side went through the 1st stage of deployment in the dashboard. Took it in, no codes registered. However they did replaced the airbag and the dashboard. Now, here it is a few months later and it happened again! Same side.. first stage of deployment, no codes, but now Suzuki is saying.. sorry no codes.. it didn't happen.. I have the perforation mark in the dashboard from deployment! Everything is the same as the first time!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I am now stuck with this car because of the deprication, I purchased this just over 1 year ago for $24,000 and now I can only get $10,000 for a trade in value. (I owe a lot more than that) Even at the dealership I originally purchased it at. Fine, let the pregnant woman keep driving an unsafe car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have bought this car in 2007. I fell in love with this car and still am. The price was good, and I also have 2 kids and they like to be in the back seat. I bought this car in case family comes to visit we can all go somewhere in one car. Oh and for the cargo it has quite a bit of room. The under storage that comes with the care all you have to do is just get like a screwdriver and look at the two screws. Once you take it out it has even more room and better. I love this car and wont get rid of it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Attracted first by looks, then acceleraton, then sound system, then fit. 2wd w/traction control. Car has a tendency to wander almost as if each wheel at times has a different amount of power than the other. We drive it but not as often as we would like because. Dealer has no explanation. Seems better without traction control. Wouldn't buy another one if it had a hint of this behavior. Love my 92 Jeep and 95 Subuaru. Suzuki looks good in the driveway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We just purchased this rig a few days ago with 33k. The first thing we did was take it on about a three hour trip. We love the roomy interior. Seats were pretty comfortable. I had plenty of leg and head room. The accellaration was great! Fuel econommy accoring to the onboard trip computer hit 26mpg on the freeway. Lots of cargo room. For the price we feel this is an excellent value. I see some people are whinning about cheap inerior panels. Sure they could be better. If you want better get off your wallet and buy a Caddillac or something. For the price we feel this rig is an excellent value. If we wanted nicer we would have spent more money. This has all the features and comfort we need.</TEXT>

<TEXT> Had to sell at 24000 miles. Was using Quart of oil every thousand miles.Very expensive synthetic oil I might add. Lot of road rattles for a $30000 SUV. Poor gas mileage 13 city. Depreciated too much first 2 years. 2 accidents backing out of driveway because you can hardly see out the back.Dealer had in shop long time took the engine apart could not find the problem. Figure I would sell back to them out of frustration.Disapointing vehicle we planned to keep 7-10 years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I bought this in Nov 06 I loved it. I still love it but I am having problems when I start it and the check engine light is on. It is at the dealer now. They supposedly fixed it but it did the same thing the day after I got it back (1400 bucks later). I still love it very much and just want them to fix it. Starting to worry.

<TEXT>I bought this XL7 brand new in August of 2007, it was back at the dealership on December for a loud noise coming from the front suspension whenever I turned or passed on a bump. It was there for about a month until finally they figured out what was wrong and fixed it. Now about 3 weeks ago the same noise came back, but guess what? The local dealership closed and now I have to drive about 4 hrs. to the nearest dealership because Suzuki wont allow me to take it anywhere else here locally. Stay away from SUZUKI, their customer service is horrible, they talk to you in a very unprofessional manner, and when you have a problem you are basically stuck with it.American cars are better...</TEXT>

<TEXT>well, going on 2 yrs and this has been a very good car for us, comfy on long trips to Montana from seattle and was even getting 27 mpg on that trip. Generally getting 19 around town. It has a large gas tank compared to most SUVs in its class even though I honestly wish it was a 20 gallon tank. HUGE cargo capacity for this class of suv, you can really load it up. It's not top notch but we only paid $19 grand for it, Got around great in 6 inch snow and just cable chains on the front tires. We looked at trading it in but after looking at all the other SUVs, the fuel economy, and the cost of those SUVs we decided to just keep it. Unfortunately, this car really lost a lot of its value.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you are stuck with one of these, be aware it has no value in a year's time. Terrible turning range, cramped cabin, very uncomfortable seats, they're too short for your legs, makes long trips tiring. We have 2 children and the 3rd row seat really is a waste, because you need that room for storage. The dash quality is cheaply made and started puckering after 6 months. After 2 days of this vehicle, we knew we'd made a mistake!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Solid comfortable ride city and highway. City gas mileage could be better. We average about 14 but that's at 25 to 35 mph and a lot of traffic lights. Drove from Louisville to Miami fully loaded and got around 23 to 24 at 75 to 80 mph. You can haul a lot of stuff in it. Small back window creates an adventure at times backing up. Vehicle is very peppy and the blizzard we had last winter did not phase the all wheel drive. The only problem so far was a brake light went out but the dealer replaced at no charge</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our XL7 after reading and researching all the midsize SUV's. The honeymoon was over about 3,000 miles into it. We have had to take it back to the dealership 3 or 4 times because the "motor mount" kept causing problems with the ignition and thumping and knocking noises from the bottom. We also had trouble with a clicking sound in the odometer area. They told us at the dealership that it would resolve itself...not. Love the look of the car and would be 100% satisfied if we hadn't had to keep going back for repairs (the same thing each time) Seems like Suzuki didn't work out all the kinks on the 2007 XL7. We probably won't buy another, but what do you do? We'll keep it for now.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am extremely happy with my XL7. I traded in my 2004 Grand Vitara, as soon as the re-designed XL7 hit the showroom. I am in love with this vehicle! I get many compliments on the aerodynamic look of the vehicle! The handling is outstanding, gas mileage is better than the Grand Vitara, much more spacious than my husband's 2007 Honda Pilot (he's envious). Dashboard design is beautiful!! Suzuki has a real showstopper here!!</TEXT>

I'm very wrong, can't believe the XL7, it's wonderful, can't think of anything other than why is it not as famous as the others in its class, they need to do some more advertising, this is a great car that people should know about. It's a joy to drive, looks fantastic with the peace of mind of 100,000 miles! Suzuki has come a long way from the 80s and 90s. Just try it, you'll love it! </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought an XL7 luxury package with a sunroof and 3rd row, and we LOVE it. Two days after we bought it we we made a 6 or 7 hour trip to Virginia and the car performed great, we figured gas mileage wouldn't be too good since the car wasn't broken in but it got 23 mpg and was comfortable on the trip, with size and style and features and great price and warranty I have no idea why these aren't more popular, we are very pleased and look forward to many miles with our XL7. If you are considering Pilot, Highlander, or the like you should really shop at Suzuki as well.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for more than 6 months and am completely satisfied with it. It is roomy, powerful and fun to drive. Handles very easily; it's very fast. Great cargo space when 3rd row is folded. I am looking forward to testing the trailer hitch because one of reasons to buy this car was 3500 lb trailer towing ability. We had couple very long trips in it and I can say this car is very comfortable. For example my wife and I drove from Grand Rapids, MI to Niagara Falls, NY. It took us about 12 hours to get there and in the end of the day we still had a lot of energy to walk around and enjoy the Niagara Falls. I feel very confident when I drive this car in any season.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I just purchased this vehicle last week. We looked at the Pilot, Santa Fe and Highlander. In comparison to all four vehicles, the Suzuki has more leg room, bigger cargo space, more fuel efficient and better features. If you are looking to place a child in the back seat, it is very child friendly. Also, I am 6'1" and I sat in back of all vehicles (all 3 touched my knees) and this had the most leg room. We were searching for a vehicle with a lot of room for a reasonable price and this vehicle met our needs. Look at all 4 vehicles for yourself and you will see the difference.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Shows you how many miles until empty, how much time life on your oil, how much pressure you have in all 4 tires, great breaking system, rear leg room, large cargo space (especially for a large family), dual exhaust.

<TEXT>I shopped, drove, and pretty much evaluated every mid size SUV under 30k MSRP I could get my hands on over a 2 day period. After sitting down and discussing what we liked and didn't like about each vehicle the XL7 came away the winner. The ride is smooth, it has good throttle response, steering and handling are impressive. I took it up into the mountains and had a ball with the manumatic shifter. Things like leather heated power seats, power sunroof, AWD, Auto Temp Controls, etc., were out of reach cost wise in other vehicles were within our budget with the XL7. Smooth sporty body lines and a price in the low 20s sealed the deal for us. A 7yr-100k warranty, this one is a no brainer. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth ride, responsive handling, leather interior. Even the standard radio sounds good. Cruise and radio controls on the steering wheel. Fit and finish inside were impressive. Mileage was low at first but is gradually improving (mixed driving is avg 19mpg at 450mi). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The day after we brought it home we noticed fluid spots in the driveway. Under 3000 miles and the seals in the transfer case had to be replaced. The vehicle seems different now. At first we thought that we were experiencing road feedback because the vehicle feels like it's surging ever so slightly. But while on a smooth road recently, it felt like the transmission stumbled a couples times and then caught again because it pushed me back into the seat when it occured and it felt like a hard thunk. The vehicle is going back to the dealer for a look see but I doubt that they find anything. I also noticed today that a bolts holding the drivers door stop on are working themselves out. I want out!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought the XL7 after a lot of research and going to toyota, honda and hyundai dealerships. The XL7 is very well priced SUV for 7 with nice features for price about 4-5k less than others and it really does have third row seats you can sit in. The other SUVs had them for the sake of just having them. Suzuki could have done better with interiors I think. There is a little engine noise while while taking off but on the whole it's value for the money I think. Took it on a long drive and it was clearly a winner. My advice test drive Pilot, Highlander, Santa Fe and XL7 before you buy one because it's only then you will know if you like it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It took me lots of reading and thought to choose, but when all was said and done I am happy we bought this new XL7. My wife still has the older version which has proven to be extremely reliable and worth its own. The new one, side by side, shows a complete redesign. We have all the added safety features and third row (all worthwhile) and our children are fascinated with the DVD (it even comes with wireless headphones). Driving is fun, the leather interior is a big plus and the seat is wider than the old version. Seat belts are all 3 point and it has 8 airbags (6 side 2 front). The AWD and the automatic stability control do not affect the joy of driving it but it feels different than our old one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We love the roominess felt inside (height) and the extras like leather, DVD, electric seats. Larger cargo area with extra storage beneath. Drives nicely. The MP3, wireless headphones and extra spaces. All the built in safety features. Love the reliability.</FAVORITE>

Mine is the base model and does not have the 3rd row of seats, so I have loads of cargo room which is great for groceries, and the kid's sports gear or whatever else I need to haul. It rides very nice, getting in and out is easy because it's not that high off the ground, but it's not too low either. But when you're driving it, you feel like it's up a little higher than a car mostly because of the adjustable seat. I'm short, so I have it the whole way up. All in all, the more I drive it, the more I love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the DIC, Driver Information Center, it tells you average MPG, average miles left before needing fuel, oil, battery life and tire pressure. Auto headlights and auto climate control are very nice. I like where the power window switches are and they have a red light on them to find in the dark. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a excellent vehicle inside and out. The engine is phenomenal and it drives like a luxury sedan. Loaded up six adults (2 over 6' tall) w/child seat with ease. Suzuki really hit this nail on the head.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rear DVD player w/wireless headset, remote start, the interior lights, you can turn off the daytime running lights, information computer and 7 passenger seating.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Suzuki XL7 is a fun crossover SUV to drive both on the interstate and in the mountains. Areas of future improvement should be the brakes, which require a significant amount of pressure, and rear view visibility is limited. Fuel economy on the highways has been fair at 24 mpg. After 3500 miles not a single problem. Good value for the money. If you do your own oil changes it is no fun to get the oil filter off since it is easier to take out an appendix.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, simplicity, driving position and comfort level.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I really like this SUV. VERY SAFE. Many safety features and strong crash test rating. One of the best warranty programs available. I upgraded from a 2004 Isuzu Rodeo (which I never had problem with) to the 2007 XL7. I love the interior, very comfortable drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The XL7 has a different design and appeal than most other SUVs on the market. It has massive head room and a ton of storage compartments. The interior is cutting edge with all modern technologies. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A crossover for everyone in the family. For dad a sporty powerful suv. For mom versatility and room of a minivan. For the kids style with dvd & gaming input. For elderly parent easy of entry and exit (ladder not needed). We bought the limited w/dvd and everyone just loves it and after 12 years in a minivan, that's a lot for a crossover. If you are looking for a crossover or minivan, don't overlook the suzuki XL7 '07. Fit and finish was great on ours - 2 months and 3 thousand miles, 19.2 mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling, interior styling, safety features, loaded for under 30,000.00, warranty, 3rd row.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I became a Suzuki fanatic when I bought my '06 Aerio. It's little but has a powerful engine. Now my wife drives a brand new XL-7. It is roomy, handles like a fancy sedan, responds excellently and there's no way it compares to the Equinox. I tested both, the XL-7 has European window switches, a charger 4 manual speed, and most importantly my whole crew (3 kids), grandma, and grandpa fit comfortably in it. My salesperson provided outstanding customer service. I paid under $23,000 for it. We are very happy with it. We can't wait for the summer and drive it up to Yosemite. It;s too fancy for off road driving. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The futuristic styling of the front.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I did a thorough comparison of vehicles when shopping. The XL-7 compares very well for the price with other vehicles in its class. The trim level I selected includes a DOHC/252HP V6 engine with DVD/Sat radio, leather and 7 passenger seating. It is hard to find all this for the price that I paid in any other make/model. this truck is very fun to drive and looks great too. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The comfortable seating, exceptional head and leg-room, and sturdy handling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After sliding off the freeway in my 2004 XL-7 during a bad winter storm (and then rolling and totaling it), I knew I wanted my replacement to still seat 7, but have front/all wheel drive instead, and side curtain airbags for all 3 rows. Low and behold, I bought the 2007 model. It is much improved over the old version. I LOVE this car! I've had it two months and have had opportunity to drive it on snow and ice. It handles amazingly well in adverse conditions. My gas mileage has been steadily climbing and at 2,000 miles it is already at 20 mpg. The one downside: the stereo/DVD system stopped working and had to be replaced.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The leather seats, DVD system with wireless headphones, 3rd row, AWD, smoothness of acceleration/shifting, and lots of front row storage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The XL-7 is a good vehicle for the money. It offers a touch of class without spending $1,000s more. You do not have an option of things like high intensity headlights or a backup camera, but it has a good list of toys. I wish it had better leather and less engine noise.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The navigation / radio. I like how it has an an aux input for my MP3's and the sound quality is above avg. The navigation works great!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is one outstanding stylish SUV. The value for the price is incomparable. The Suzuki dealership in was a very nice and professional experience. I did most of the legwork over the Internet including the 1.9% financing application and approval process. This was a no hassle experience in and out in under two hours.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the standard equipment at a very reasonable price including AWD for under $24,000. There is an abundance of interior space in all rows of seating. The engine has a lot of pickup with little effort and is very quite. It is extremely comfortable even on long road trips.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle for my wife but I have driven it considerably. We needed 3rd row seating and compared it with the Ford Freestyle and Honda Pilot. We thought the ride was comparable to the Pilot, but the features, price and appearance were more attractive. We love it. It accelerates well, has a smooth engine, and considering its relatively small size, it is surprisingly comfortable for the 2nd and 3rd row passengers.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The XL-7 has great handling and a nice stereo with MP3 and iPod connection capabilities.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The XL-7's driving comfort and ride are great. Its styling, especially the headlights, is unique and bold. I already have 4,000 miles and have never encountered any problem. In terms of safety, this SUV is deemed excellent as it is equipped with all available safety features. The engine is very powerful with 253 hp coupled with variable valve timing, thus passing is very quick. I purchased this car simply because of the engine, styling, and most importantly the affordable price. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love the XL-7. I was the first one in the country to own a new one. I crashed my old 2003 XL-7. I went looking for a new vehicle and could not find anything as big with all the features for under $30,000. I purchased the luxury model. It has three rows of seats, side airbags, all wheel drive, leather, heated front seats, and a DVD system for the kids. The DVD system plays MP3's, that's over 1000 songs per DVD. Also, it's a dual mode system. That means that the kids can watch a movie and I can listen to my radio. This truck's cons include the lack of heated mirrors. My 2003 XL-7 had them and the Grand Vitara has them. This is a nice feature when driving. Also, it has no Sirius radio, factory system has XM and no converter. The only saving grace is a front auxiliary input. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The heated leather seats and dimming mirror. I love how the DVD system is dual mode so that the kids have wireless headsets and I can listen to my radio.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We tested more than five SUVs with third row seats and we found that the Suzuki XL-7 provides the best value. It has a long list of standard features. Suzuki did not do a great job to advertising the XL-7. Some features were not even listed in their specifications. Many web sites have the wrong information too. For example, the driver seat is 6-way power instead of 4-way power. It has reading lights for the second row, not just the front row, etc. Our local dealer is very nice, and they have no-hassle pricing, which is far below invoice. I noticed small paint problem inside of the front window frame this morning. But overall the vehicle seems to be very well made. And I do not notice any cheap materials.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the DVD/CD system that supports MP3/WMA, the auto/manual transmission, and the on board computer that can display trip information and vehicle information.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Coming from the 2004 the current model is vastly superior in ride comfort, dimensions, power (252 hp!) and technology / features. Suzuki really went all out with the gadgets: remote start; navigation; power seats; quality leather & materials; chrome wheels; even tossed in the free vehicle alarm and XM satellite radio! Compared to a similarly equipped Murano the XL-7 is approx $10,000 less. This is an extremely safe vehicle with side curtain airbags in all 3 rows. Suzuki really got it right with the new XL-7.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The list is long: voice command touch screen navigation; XM satellite radio; compass / dimming mirror; aluminum roof rack; and the passenger seat folds up to be used as a desktop for your laptop; four (4) 12v power outlets; personalized computer options; individual psi readings for each tire!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This SUV was bought by my wife, mostly by mistake, s she was interested in the Grand Vitara, and was talked into this piece of junk. It is without a doubt the worst vehicle I have ever owned or driven. Suzuki has some really great vehicles that they design and build, such as the Grand Vitara and new SX4. This ain't one of them! We sold it at a loss a month after we bought it. The previous evaluation was undoubtedly written by a dealer employee or salesman. Rating it a 10! Give me a break. It gets lousy gas mileage and has a noisy / thrashy engine. Its fit and finish are the worst I've ever seen, mismatched plastic, flimsy trim falling off in your hand. This is a thinly disguised Chevy Equinox, which is rated very low!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>None, we hated every inch of it. I would prefer a Yugo or Peugeot! At least I would expect one of those cars to fall apart in your hand. Lucky it has the great, long Suzuki warranty, because you'll need it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have a 2006 Grand Vitara and love it. We had a smaller car that just didn't seem very safe, so we decided to spring for a second SUV with a third row of seating. We looked at Durangos, Chrysler Pacificas, etc... Nothing seemed as luxurious and spacious and priced right with high gas mileage, as the 2007 XL-7. When I drove the XL-7 vs. the other vehicles, the visibility and control I had were awesome. With two children, and a dog, this vehicle was the best purchase we have ever made. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The AWD, roomy third row seating, Climate control etc...</FAVORITE>
