<TEXT>My sister and I both have the 2007 commander. Mine has 38,000 miles and the sunroof and windshield are leaking. The water shorted out the radio. Windshield has been repaired 2 times. My sister's has leaked since day 1. I liked the jeep until it started flooding. Rides good. Don't like the second row stadium seating. Cannot see out the back window with 3rd row up. I am past the warranty, so I am riding in a flooded car with no stereo. The cost for repair is $900. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drives well on the street and in dirt. like the heated seats. Looks much better than a minivan and easy to park</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have read up on reviews online and found that there are many people that are having trouble with their jeep stalling out while on a freeway or driving down a road. This has happened to me 4 times now going 70 mph. We are contacting a lawyer b/c we get nothing but the run around when contacting jeep. We have taken it in and they find nothing. What are we supposed to do? Just take our chances and hope not to stall while someone is tailgaiting on a freeway? I am putting my life at risk every time I get into that death trap. So what do I do..I still owe money so I would have to trade it in but HOW do I in good conscious trade in a car that has almost caused a accident? </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I looked and looked and looked for a SUV that fit us and our 3 kids without the size of a suburban. We absolutely love this jeep. The gas mileage isn't great but it is fun to drive, it seats seven, and its very comfortable. We went with the V6 because there wasn't a need to pull anything, but it still offers plenty of power and get up. I am confident that it could pull a ski boat and 7 passengers with no problems. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Leased a 2007 Jeep Commander in Clearwater, Florida. My Jeep developed a horrible leak. When it rains I get a standing puddle of water on the floor on the driver's side. Dealership said it's a maintenance issue and said it will be $100 to blow out a sunroof drain line because it's clogged with debris. I argued there is nothing in the owner's manual addressing this "maintenance" and pointed out that there are also several service bulletins issued by Chrysler addressing this issue. They said this is the customer's responsibility. No wonder Chrysler is in trouble.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is a great looking car and has all of the interior features I would need. It would be great if it had more power but the power it has is enough to get you around. The gas mileage averages about 13.5 miles per gallon but other than that it is an excellent car. The only problems that I have had with the car were that one of the tire pressure sensors was messed up but that was covered by warranty so it was no big deal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the exterior styling and the front seat comfort I do not think is matched by any other SUV I have driven.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We got the Limited with the 5.7 Hemi and all the bells and whistles. So far we have been very pleased. This truck will go anywhere and the third row seats, although cramped for adults, really serve our family of 5 well. The powertrain is awesome, although the fuel economy is definitely poor(as we knew before the purchase). The towing abilities are also well appreciated. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the SUV in June 08 and I haven't had any problems with the vehicle yet. The gas mileage is horrible but the car drives wonderful. I ran over a large screw driver this weekend and I drove 15 miles with it in my tire because I couldn't pull it out. The guy at Tires Plus had a very hard time pulling the screw driver out of the tire. It took him about 15 minutes to get it out. When he finally got it out of the tire, it didn't need to be replace. He put the tire in the solution and there was no damage. Wow!!! I hope I have good luck with the rest of the car like I did with the tires. Also I wish the 3rd row could have a been more comfortable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I purchased a Jeep Commander Rocky Mount. My wife loved the look of the commander and I liked the lifetime warranty. Soon after purchasing it, one month, a loud whistling noise started coming from the dash. After three trips back to the dealer they stated they didn't know how to fix the problem. Since then, if you try to close the front two windows along with the sun roof, the sunroof will open itself back up. Again they stated there is nothing they can do because they don't know how to fix it. We are now involved in a lawsuit forcing them to buy it back. They are trying to say we have to pay them to buy it back. do not buy this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the commander, comfort is great. 700 mile trip very comfortable. Wind noise(whistling) on passenger side that NO ONE can hear but us and anyone that rides with us( how funny is that) Service says there are not service advisories on it (why not? Jeep forum is FULL of complaints.) The service department thinks we are crazy. Lately it only happens once in a while. but changes in temps will be happening very soon here in LA. We shall see.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my Chrysler Pacifica for the Commander. I loved the way it drove and handled and was looking to only upgrade. Once I drove the Commander it was surprisingly pleasant and I liked the sporty look. People often mistaken my "P" for a van which I hated. What I don't like is the 3rd row seat (for kids or small adults but ok), it blocks visibility when head rests are up, passenger seat sits to low, very hard to see stop light when stopped, rain collects at driver door, need better cup holders in 2nd row, and air vents make noise when opening to defrost. Gas mileage could be better. Thank God I live 5-10 miles from work and my daughters school. I miss the "P" but beginning to love my "C"! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I really love driving this vehicle. You sit very high up which gives good visibility. Very roomy and love the rear park assist. Love the look of the exterior. I had a major problem with the vehicle leaking from the sunroof, windshield, and driver's side grip handle. The dealership tried 4 times to fix the issue but were unsuccessful. It needs a better water draining system from its roof. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our Commander late one afternoon. It had a cool look to it and a third row seat. Which needs to be ditched..you can't see out the back window but through an 11x14 space. The main thing that I hate about the car is the canvas seats that, we were told were stain resistant and water resistant..wrong! My seats are horrible looking and I now have camo seat covers on the back seats because I am embarrassed for the way they look. The windshield whistles when you get past 60 mph. There is no leg room in the front. If I turn the corner hard enough the tires screech. It's been in the shop 2x for power steering failure, in the middle of driving, 6 more months on our lease, PTL. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The color and looks, chrome detail inside. I guess the over all look sold me on it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Jeep with the first still in the family. My Commander is very comfortable, spacious and quiet. I've had it for 11 months and the only real problem experienced is with the rear shocks or springs. From the first month, I had the shock replaced, then replaced again, now going back for the 3rd time. The constant squeak is very annoying. Steering wheel has also started whistling - odd? If I can get this resolved, I will be very happy with my Commander.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The look of the Commander, leather heated seats, NAV system, back up camera is a real plus, love the stadium seats and backseat sunroof, good power and great comfort when on a long trip.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love everything about this car with one exception, this should be a 5 passenger vehicle. Do not buy it if you plan on using the third row. As it is now, both the second & third row are way too cramped. Two adults in the second row are uncomfortable after 30 a 30 minute trip. If you only have small kids in the second row you're fine. This car is not as large as Jeep seems to think it is. The seond row seats do not slide back & the third row is a complete waste. Gas mileage sucks, but you already know that if you are looking at this type of vehicle :-)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my Expedition on the Hemi as my teenagers are working their way out of the house (the third seat in the Ford was no longer really needed) and I wanted a smaller vehicle. I still needed a high tow capacity truck and the "if you need it, it is there" third seat. In short, the vehicle was a great buy with the rebate and had quite a few features that my Expedition did not have. Lots complain about gas mileage: I get 17.2 hwy (better than the Ford). The ride and comfort are better than the Expedition. It is also quieter. The interior needs some refinement - fit & finish is good but style could be improved to give it a higher end feel (it is slightly tacky IMO).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable leather seats and all of the little nooks & crannies for storage. Kids & adults love the stadium seating for the second row. Good storage with all seats folded flat and the dogs can ride comfortably as well. Great skylights and good maneuverability especially for parking.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I finally got a Jeep and I am so glad I did. I got the base model awd, but it has really come in handy with the snow. I love the large windows, adjustable seat. I love the outside desgin, and the adjustable driver's seat makes you feel like you could go right out the roof it seats so high. I have read that some drivers say the seat is not comfortable, it is only not comfortable if you sit too high. The stereo system is great. A stylish, comfortable vehicle that is a pleasure to drive and ride in. Oh, I got rear ended by a Subaru, totalled the Subaru, and I have to point to point out the dent on my car or nobody even notices it. The funny thing is, I was going to buy a Subaru.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded a 99 Wrangler due to a growing family. Test drove minivans but this is so much nicer, even Toyota and Honda. Kids love the stadium seating and I have found backing up isn't as bad as others have made it sound because of park assist and good mirrors. Amazing in snow due to the stability control (ESP) system. Wider and taller than most mid-size vehicles so it feels spaceous but not as huge as a full-size. Fits in parking decks no problem. Great ride (not too floaty) and very maneuverable. Leather is very nice and seats are very comfortable. Third row has plenty of room for an adult but seat sits a bit low for really long trips. Rear hatch opens low enough to clear standard garage door.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stability control, satellite radio, seats fold easily. Third row access much better than CX-9 and easier than minivans due to higher ceiling. Three rows of air bags and ESP - very safe. DVD system. Trip computer. Front seat small item storage. Park Assist. Sun roofs. Better mileage than full-size.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my Commander a month ago and I love it! I had also considered the Patriot, Chevy Equinox and Ford Escape, and am glad that I chose the bigger SUV. I recently took a 1400 mile trip and it rode great on the highway and I felt very comfortable and safe. The gas mileage was decent considering how big this car really is, I am averaging 16-18 city and 19- 21 highway. The only problem so far is the CD player which first wouldn't take in a CD, and now it does but reads "Error." Overall, I love the ride, looks, and it goes through snow like nothing!</TEXT>

We had to have a 3rd row seat and 4x4.Considered other larger SUV's (Tahoe, Yukon, Escalade, etc.) Found this one used with low miles for a great price. The only thing it didnt have was a DVD system and a hitch. The dealer added those items plus tinted the windows for no cost. That was the seller for us. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was worried the 3.7L engine would not have enough power but it is adequate. I have 2 children in car seats and an 8yr old and there is plenty of room. We are talking large Britax car seats and I was still able to pack my 3 kids and my friends 2 elementary aged children in the Jeep including her with no problems. I love my Jeep, I wouldn't trade it for any other vehicle out there! The stereo is great for not going with the upgraded system and the rear ac/heater and reverse sensing are wonderful. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned this now for three months and love the sportiness. However, the estimate of 16/22 mpg is way, way off base. I average 10-12 mpg. city and recently took a trip and averaged 13- 14 mpg highway! Not sure yet if this is worth the upsides of the vehicle. Only other complaint is no cargo nets when hauling groceries in back...stuff rolls out of gate when opened. Third row does block rear view and very little leg room when used. Fine for every day but not as comfortable and roomy for long trips. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Driver seat moves to where I can get comfortable. Good engine power, reasonable economy for V8 SUV. Transmission shifts crisp, automatic 2 speed transfer case is very quiet and works properly. I had reviewed and considered Ford Explorer, Expedition, Dodge Durango, Chrysler Aspen, GMC Envoy and Chevy Trailblazer. There were 2 warranty problems from the get go: E-brake was not connected from the factory and there is tick noise in front axle dealer is having trouble finding. Other than that I like the vehicle. It fits our needs with style. Mine actually was not a Limited edition but it was the only style I could select to complete tis review. Mine was a Sport edition with the 4.7L engine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased this due to the 3rd row, as that was the main factor in buying it. I absolutely love the car, it rides amazing (we don't do any offroading) and I feel 100% safe with my family and my 2 year old son, with the side airbags. But with the 2nd row having a small amount of leg room, there's barely enough room for his car seat, I don't know how he'll fit in it in a another year while still in his car seat. Also, wish it was a bit lower to the ground. Stadium seating is great, but takes away a few inches of cargo room.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Jeep Commander is a really fine SUV. I shopped the Expdetion, Tahoe, Armada and Sequoia. Finally decided on the Jeep. The overland has a lot of features for the money with the incentives Jeep offers: Bluetooth, NAV, rear DVD, 3rd row, rear sensors, heated seats, auto high beams, sunroof, tow package, tons of airbags and more. It is a little small for the price when compared to the true full-size utes like the Tahoe, but usually is adequate and the smaller size comes in handy in most daily tasks. But my point is with the new 2008 Liberty in the line why does Jeep still offer the Grand Cherokee? The Commander is the better buy and much closer to the cool/trendy Grand Wagoneer.</TEXT>

The 4.7L has plenty of power and when driven sensibly can average fine fuel economy on the freeway. This is our first Jeep product and we love it so far! I would recommend the Commander without reservation to any family that needs to haul people and stuff on a regular basis. This is my 13th brand new car and I think it's my favorite!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our family of five (6,8,13) fit perfectly in the Commander with room for friends. It is the perfect size for us. We live on a country road and it handles the bumps with ease. It rides very well on the highway and exceleration is adequite. The sound system is very good and I love the manual shift auto transmission. We have not tested the mileage which I usually don't until after the second oil change and start using synthetics. I will pay the extra fuel costs for the comfort. I have the same issue viewing traffic thru the rear glass with the third seat in the upright position. The rear sensing alarm is cool. Jeep offered a lifetime full coverage warranty for $1100 that was awsome. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Commander as the family shuttle, realizing its limitations in that regard; it is not a mini Van, so in that capacity it is just adequate. It is not just a suburban taxi, it wants to play. It is a 7 seat 4x4 SUV and as that, it stands out as you leave the road and hit the trails. On the roads the Hemi's power is effortless and always available. Inside it is very comfortable and my three kids (10, 9, and 6) love the stadium seating and the moonroof. It is quiet inside and the sound system is excellent.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First of all we have had issues with our Commander from the first week. When accelerating it sounds like it is going to blow up. There is a loud humming noise that comes from the dash when you reach 55-60 mph. Also, our Jeep is full of rust! All of the seat hardware components (including the headrest) are rusted.

<TEXT>We have owned this vehicle for about a month now and we love it! We went with the Rocky Mountain Edition and it is different and fun to drive. It has a very comfortable ride and makes any rough road feel like nothing. My wife and I usually race to get in the drivers seat!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We love being able to have seven passengers! Other favorites are the Boston Stereo, six disk changer, Sirius satellite radio, comfort, back up sensors, quiet interior, interior design, moonroof and skylights, chrome 17" wheels, and of course the looks! We also like the Goodyear Fortera Tires.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Excellent interior design with a very comfortable ride. It quickly and easily converts from 5 to 7 passenger seating. The 4.7L V8 flex-fuel has plenty of power, and having the flex fuel option can help your pocketbook at the gas station. The only negatives to the vehicle are that the gas mileage drops about 25% (not just a mile or two per gallon but the highway mileage drops from 20 to 15!) and one annoying design flaw is that it is easy to strike the key with your knee which actually turns the vehicle off. On a recent trip I actually did this twice. The jeep is as good off road as any Jeep I've owned and the Quadratrac II works beautifully. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Our kids preferred this vehicle over the Trailblazer and Explorer because of the stadium seating. They still love it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned it a couple of weeks and I love it. The only drawbacks are gas and the rear view window. The rear view is mostly covered up by the 3rd row seat. But overall I love this SUV. I switched from my mid-size Camry and so far I think I did a great choice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The looks and the feeling of driving a real SUV with the comforts of an automobile.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our 2nd Jeep. We traded our '05 Liberty for this. The "Overland" rocks. We love it. It rides much nicer than the 2wd Liberty we had. Very quiet at highway speeds. Easy to get above 80 and not realize it. The Hemi is smooth and effortless. Mileage is lousy...but hey, it is a Hemi, we are expecting that. Kids love the skylights. Plenty of room for 2kids, dog and camping gear. Looking foward to CampJeep in VA this summer. We love our new Commander Overland. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Backup camera, backup sensors, NAV system, 4WD QuadDrive II, rear DVD player. Great sound system. Satellite radio. Bluetooth. Sport shift. Lots of other automation and toys. Solid/tight assembled interior. Remote start. Power lift gate.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Acceleration from 0 is pretty good. The only time I find myself wishing from more power is when merging onto a highway. The QT1 is real good, it perform excellent in the snow, dirt, and moderate off road.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>QT1, space, comfort, stance, stability, it's got great footing.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>54 year old Wash, DC granny loves power and stares of Steel Blue Hemi. Nav screen is huge and awesome! But should work as a front DVD too. Open front doors during rain to exit, allows water to pour onto control panel. I fear what that's gonna cost. 3rd row seat is a joke - leaving no room for even 2 grocery bags. Overland is the elitist of Jeeps and should come standard with mud guard mats to protect carpet year round. Suede seats should be optional. 3rd row head rests are too BIG and block 85% of back window so I ran into a Toyota while backing into a handicap space. Front slide moon roof is too small compared to my 1989. Back moon windows should open. Rear DVD cover always falls off. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Noticeably glaring overcoat with lovely steel trim without loud engine on the Hemi. Big storage box.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have a 2007 Commander Limited with the 5.7L HEMI. I have driven it 2500+ miles so far. Mileage is better than what I expected based on other reviewers. I took a 250 mile trip and averaged 20.1 mpg using the cruise control set at 70 mph. I calculated this manually and the onboard computer confirmed it. Overall, I'm averaging 16.5 mpg on combined city/highway (25%/75%) driving. The ride is very smooth and it handles like a smaller vehicle. The torque/acceleration with the HEMI brings a big smile to my face. My favorite SUV so far (had Toyota 4Runner, Lexus RX330). The seats are comfortable and 2nd row leg room is better than advertised (stadium seating makes this row sit higher).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Boston Acoustics sound is better than in my Lexus ES330. Rear backup camera and park distance sensors work great. The 3 sunroofs make the inside feel really open. Power liftgate is very handy. The built in in-dash 6 disc CD-changer recognizes MP3's. Sirius Satellite radio is great on trips.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just purchased the Commander Sport, and we love it. The ride is smooth and the seating is comfortable. The appearance is impressive. We are very impressed with the turning radius. Not as happy with the gas mileage, for a 6 cylinder, we only averaged about 17-18 mpg on a recent highway road trip, and close to 15mpg in the city.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>7 passenger seating, stadium seating. A great ride for the price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned my Jeep Commander for a little over 6 months now and absolutely love it. Rides so smooth even over rough terrain and poor roads. Sound proofing is great and love all the amenities that came with it. Stereo is awesome for being factory, Boston Acoustic package imaging is first class with adequate power. Anti-roll stability electronics has actually help correct the vehicle one time when I approached an off ramp a lil bit too fast and started to lose control. Vehicle corrected itself with appropriate deceleration and braking of proper wheels. I was thoroughly impressed. However sometimes when entering and exiting certain bumpy rotarys I have had same electronics make vehicle stumble.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Heated seats, sound system, sunroofs, stadium seating,interior space, and storage compartments,rugged and beefy rims and tires, low tire pressure indicator built in instrument cluster, rear seat reclineability, rugged cloth interior, multiple cigarette lighter ports, built in information center </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased the Commander fully loaded with a 5.7L, HEMI. It comes loaded with navigation, DVD player and seating for 7, 3 sun roofs. This large SUV is totally responsive and stays on the road on turns with the quadra-trak system. We have owned other large SUV's and this one is the favorite of the American made SUV's.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Favorite feature is the responsiveness and the tight steering, more like a sports car.</FAVORITE>
