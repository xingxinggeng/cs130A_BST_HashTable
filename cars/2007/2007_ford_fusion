<TEXT>I love this car! It has a sleek look to it(Sporty yet elegant). Great sound system. Havn't had any maintenance issues after 50,000 miles. Really good handling(I had to swerve sharply on the highway once and the car was very responsive and easy to control). Very comfortable and plenty of space(even in the back seats). Great car for long comutes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system, handling, 17" wheels, interior layout(The analog clock for the SEL is a particularly nice touch). Ford's extended warranty and pre-paid service plan(Though I haven't had any maintenance issues yet, the extended warranty and service plan are a great peace-of-mind).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Is fact now that a control arm defect is confirm, but at 25,000 mile is maintenace service were from dealer. So do you want to replace the problem for $419 with the same defect product. Also, if tried align with defect product will cause gas will burn faster and wear you tire faster. Also engine correction on V belt replace. To must problem. Plus a copy of MADZA 6 suspension, i should have just but Madza. Rate now of $10,000 and less and year and model, if paid more you got robbery. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall I am very pleased with the purchase nearly 3 years later. I still get compliments on the cars styling. For a purchase price less than $25,000 the car was a solid value. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling is excellent esp. with the 17" wheels. Sound system is also quite good. Leather seats are comfortable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2007 Ford Fusion SEL used in October of 08' with around 24k on her. I had read many reviews on the car before my initial purchase and was willing to take the leap. I also hated my 2003 Liberty, and refused to purchase a GM or Chrysler product again. I had never owned a Ford product before, and was a bit nervous. However, I have been greatly impressed with the vehicle thus far. I love the leather seating, although it does not seem to have the quality of other vehicles. A little premature cracking, etc. I have experienced some odd cabin noises, various creaking and such, mainly from the passenger seat and console. Get up and go is fair, gas mileage could be better. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>What I like best about the Fusion is the fact that there are many after market accessories. Chrome galore, the list goes on. The seats are very comfortable and have so many seating variations that sometimes I feel as if I am driving a different vehicle from time to time. Styling is fantastic!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I owned my Fusion for two years. Purchased new in 2007. The car has had its issues (most of the headaches were caused by the dealership), but overall, I am happy with it. The handling, the leg room, quiet interior are a few highlights. The one feature that stands out is the AWD. It works, and it works well. A few bad winters with the standard package of snow, ice, freezing rain, slush, and the occasional ham-head soccer mom with her 23 passenger SUV sliding backwards in my lane did not hinder the car's ability to make it to point B, and back to point A. The location of the auxiliary input is also a plus. Located in the center console with an extra 12 volt DC outlet was an excellent idea.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Fusion used and immediately loved it. I hadn't planned on buying a Ford and was really looking at the Camry and Accord but I fell it love with the Fusion after the first test drive. It looks great. It rides and handles great. Its not a sports car but I have no problem passing on the freeway. I have been getting 27 MPG with mixed driving. The few small complaints I have about it have all been fixed in the newer models. My car was totaled by a drunk driver while it was parked in front of my house and the only car Im considering to replace it is another Fusion. Just a great car that is well made and thousands less than any of its competitors.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fusion - a merging of diverse elements into a unified whole. Fits the description of the Ford Fusion I bought - 2007, one owner w/ 18,200 miles. I studied and researched several cars before deciding on the V6 SEL Fusion and I have not been disappointed in the least. Class and style - a head turner. Very comfortable and responsive. Hope the long term reliability holds true.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car in Nov 08, with 7800 miles. Living in Western Pa. and traveling 100 miles a day to work and back. I was looking for something that had great handling in the snow. The AWD V6 is very responsive and great traction on snow and wet roads. The Fusion's has allot of room and a comfortable ride. No problems. I put 20,000 miles on so far, have been averaging 22 combined and 26 HWY. The design is awesome, Ford has a real winner in the Fusion. I would recommend this car to anyone. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>My opinion</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>The way it is build feel like a Toyota Corolla handle. Problem with value stem in the first years. Fuel burns like a toyota corolla one tank get you to dallas, as for the fusion half tank. Steering is bad sway can lose control if high winds of texas. I believe that the computer is outside the firewall and in texas were is flood i would not buy this car if i know. Plus I would not buy this car for 16,000 nor 13,000 for a value of the depression is quick. The only way to keep track is if is sold at 11,000 to 12,0000 and that is the max price. At 24k plus miles i am think of trading it off already. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Fusion after test driving the 4 and 6 and the awd. I settled on the awd v6. It felt that it drove through bumps and didn't hop like I felt the fwd does. The v6 is almost too much for stop and go, and the brakes are super sticky. I'm not too fond of the tall back end. I'm 6'2" and have a hard time backing up. Also the drinks are right under your shifter or your arm. And the window is so tall I can't put my arm on it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Get the appearance package. The faux leather seats fool everyone and are quite comfortable.17"rims,lower profile tires are well worth the extra price. Rear spoiler is subtle, not a big wing. Spoiler has led lites. 6cd mp3 radio is very good. No need to upgrade unless you're an audiophile nut! Handling. This is where the suprise is. It is by far the best riding and handling $20K car out there, period. Even more expensive cars can't compare to the ride. My wife says it's just as comfortable as any BMW. Getting 29 mpg mixed driving when driving like grandma. 35mpg all highway with cruise set at 65. 25mpg when driving like a typical NJ/NYC person.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my Fusion for two months. Overall, an excellent car. My driving is 100% city and I am averaging 20 MPG. There really isn't anything on the car I don't like, other than I haven't found a good dealer to get my car serviced at. Have had a quirky thing happen - the information center says the driver's side door is open when it really is not. Will have it looked at when I go in for my first oil change.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my new Ford Fusion. I get compliments on it all the time. It rides way smoother than my Mother's Chevy Impala and it is quieter too. I love the 6 disk in-dash CD player. The gas mileage could be improved a lot. I am only getting 25mpg on the highway right now. The biggest problem I have with it is my windshield. I have had my car a month and a half and I am going on my 3rd windshield. The first one splintered the 2nd week I had my car. The second one, within two days of getting it fixed it had splinters twice from small rocks hitting it. I am a highway driver so I expect rocks to do damage. But I have never had a windshield break this easily this often. It's expensive and ridiculous.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I always liked the looks but after a test drive I was sold on this Fusion. I swore away from buying Fords or any other North American cars for the last 20 years because of reliability problems compared to Japanese makes. But the Fusion is really reliable according to Consumer Report surveys. So you get a really good car with a V6 and 6 speed transmission for the price of a Japanese 4. It's a great car to drive and I love the way that 6 speed transmission responds and keeps the revs down even when you're blasting down the highway. Sure mileage could be better but that was my choice over a 4. My only disappointment was finding out until it was too late that I couldn't tow a trailer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Ford Fusion has it all, well almost. The car has sleek lines and handles like it. The 6 speed automatic is flawless and never searches for gears. The car is very quiet on the open road, very little wind noise at all. Compare this car to the others in the mid-size segment and it is a winner! You cannot go wrong with this car. I love it as much now as the day I bought it. I chose options such as ABS, heated seats, traction assist, and leather interior. With X-plan pricing and a rebate to boot, I couldn't go wrong. Neither can you!</TEXT>

<TEXT>While I only have 2,000 miles, the build quality is excellent, design and styling exception for US designed car and general thought behind car is above the rest, including Toyota and Honda. Have every option but navigation, however, there are a couple of design changes needed. The area visible once trunk is opened becomes a catch all for dust, dirt, etc. here in the desert. A better/redesigned seal on trunk is warranted. Plastic louvers are below windshield wipers needs to be improved, as it is a catch all as well. Headlight illumination could be improved and gas mileage is very poor in city stop and go driving (less than 20mpg); however, highway is approaching 30mpg. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I did not realize how well these cars handled until I drove one. There is a ton of power, when you hit the gas it goes fast. And it still gets about 28 MPG on the freeway. Also, I'm a big guy. So, I needed a car that I could fit into easily. The interior of this car is huge and it also has a massive trunk. Great for sports equipment or large subwoofers like I put in mine. I would say this car is a fantastic balance between luxury and price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned 10 new Pontiacs, 2 new Toyota's and this is my sixth new Ford and this one is the best of all. It does everything well, good performance, reasonable gas mileage for its size, and its comfortable. I like the style and enjoy driving it. The extra powerpoint needs to be outside the center console, it's hard to reach even if the console were empty which is never the case. I would like to see a super sport edition with a V-8, some gas shocks and a supercharger. This would rival the Impala SS and still be sensible enough for adults. Fusion is fun with lots of potential. If it proves to be reliable over the long term, Ford has a winner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our 2007 SEL AWD V6 Fusion is an exceptional automobile with many features you might expect in a car costing thousands of dollars more. Its distinctive, bold styling was one of the deciding factors as were the reliability statistics. This car's superb handling attributes are one of its significant pluses. My wife and I highly recommend this car to anyone who is in the market for a quality, mid-size family sedan that is fun to drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got my '07 SEL V6 leather Fusion and like it a lot. Sharpest car on the road and the Redfire paint and spoiler are awesome. Extremely smooth transmission and the V6 is as powerful as I'd ever want/need. Love the lines on this car but not quite sure about the rear tail lights yet, but they're growing on me.No interior rattles and am amazed at how well this car corners with no roll. Only issues I have so far are with the fit and finish in some areas. You get a lot of car for the money so maybe I shouldn't be complaining about the fit and finish?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a young working professional and after the first 1K miles, I'm very pleased with the Fusion. I've been a Jetta driver the last 6 years and this car has been a nice transition from import to domestic. I put a lot of miles on my cars and make frequent roadtrips, so I wanted a reliable sports sedan that wasn't a beast on gas. I opted for the SE model with the appearence package including leather-trimmed seats with red stitching, sunroof, fog lights, spoiler and upgraded tires and wheels. The ride is smooth, the styling is sleek and the overall quality has been quite impressive. The seats are extremely comfortable and make driving very enjoyable.

<TEXT>My Fusion has 3,000 miles on it. Fit and finish are excellent. The heater fan, in defrost mode, makes more noise than I expected. Otherwise, interior is excellent and quiet. Automatic transmission shifts nicely. 4cyl engine accelerates noticeably faster than my 6cyl Ranger at low and high speeds. Fuel economy averages 29+mpg with 35% stop-and-go city and 65% unimpeded highway (63-67mph)on cruise control. At each fill-up, I have figured the mileage manually to check the computer. The computer is accurate. On the highway, I have seen 33.6mpg on the computer at 63mph. Excellent value at an affordable price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely love my Ford Fusion. It is the best car I have ever owned. I went from a convertible which was very noisy to the quietest car I have ever had. The thing that attracted me first was its exterior looks. I test drove several other models including Saturn, Dodge and Toyota but the Ford Fusion was the best. I bought the dark blue pearl and it looks great with the chrome grill. It accelerates well too. I have to drive up a lot of hills where I live. It also has a great sound system. I also bought it for the traction control and AWD because of bad winters. I plan on owning this car for many years to come.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Test drove a SEL Fusion after driving a 2007 Altima. Not only was the Fusion $3,000 less, but it has all wheel drive. The Fusion has a great ride and handles great, probably due in no small part to the premium tires. During a recent snow storm, the car performed great on frozen slush and ice. The audiophile/Sirius sound system is also terrific (much much better than the Bose system in my Murano). The fit and finish of the car are every bit as good as the Altima. The only flaw I've found is a little flashing on the door panel. Controls are logically placed and the ergonomics were well thought out. The heated leather seats are very supportive and comfortable. Another plus is the large trunk.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our 2007 V6, 6-speed automatic transmission AWD SEL Fusion is a fantastic car EXCEPT for the horrific in-city gas mileage, a pitiful 13 mpg after 1,800 miles. Our terrain is flat as a fritter. The climate is mild (56 degrees on Feb. 27) and we are both conservative, gentle drivers. The car did, however achieve 26.5 mpg (going) and 24.2 mpg (returning) on a recent 360-mile trip. It's the in-city, stop-and-go travel, 95 percent of our driving, that is the killer. I find it incomprehensible that a 3,300-pound, mid-size car would have such terrible in-city mileage in the year 2007. We enjoy everything else about the car. Ford has a winner here. But the mileage situation needs to be addressed</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 2200 miles I can say: great fun to drive. Excellent on highway with minimal road noise and no cross wind disturbance. Transmission shifts smoothly and silently. Braking is straight and secure. Super climate control system with heated leather seats makes cold weather no problem. Seems very well built with excellent fit and finish. Tall riders love back seat leg room. Large trunk and fold down seats allow surprising storage. Agree with previous comments about less than perfect rear visibility at the corners and turning radius a bit wide with 17inch wheels but still parks easily. </TEXT>

Other than that you can't buy a better car for anywhere near the price. I have all the luxury options except AWD and have had no problems with anything on the car.

<TEXT>This is a fun car. I have read some reviews where people say I wish it had auto on off lights etc. It comes with auto on off lights in this trim. Feels sturdy and secure, handles very well in snow and ice. Interior is fine but needs to be adjusted e.g. Nav system should be up higher so driver doesn't have to look down to see it etc. You need rear spoiler or else third brake light blocks your rear view.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently traded in my Subaru and was intrigued by Ford's new AWD Fusion. It looked like a good package overall, so I gave it a chance. I'm impressed. The powertrain is quite refined, maybe not on the level of a Camry, but very good. I'd love to see Ford's larger 3.5 in this car. The transmission has been very responsive, and, oddly, I feel has gotten better over time (upshifting, "knowing" my driving style). Fit and finish is better than I've seen in almost any car in its class. I've been averaging about 21-22 in suburbs and some highway, but I'm a fairly aggressive driver, so I'm pleased. So far, I would definitely recommend this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>i will feel guilty if i don't share my great experiences with you. Great price, great car and great dealer! Ford should tell the truth, instead of 23/31 MPG, i get 27/35 MPG for the first month and first 1000 miles. Yes, as the reviewers here said, I-4 is a little bit noisy when the engine speed is higher than 2000 rpm at local driving. However, when you drive it on highway, man, it is so quiet. I am a Ford lover. Compared to other Ford cars, you can see Ford pays a lot of attention on it and try to regain the No.1 position of family car! Taurus lost its No.1 in 1996. Fusion is very competitive from all aspects; compared to my Focus, it is worth to pay the extra money. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior design is great: simple, clean and neat. Sound system, 6 disc CD/MP3 player, information center, the steering wheel is also my favorite. Did I say that?

<TEXT>I was kinda nervous because Ford never had the best reputation, however this car is very awesome! I got the I-4 SE with the appearance package which has the best rims you can get (aluminum with painted inside pockets) and the black vinyl with red stitching and red fabric inlay. The quality seems very good, the ride is awesome and smooth, virtually no road noise. I am very impressed! There is a lot that is standard with this car, which is nice for a change.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering wheel radio and cruise controls, speed compensated sound, nice stereo, cup holders and compartments everywhere, standard iPod jack, trip computer with average MPG, trip times, lets you know when a headlight is out, smooth ride, excellent gas mileage, peppy 4 cylinder, very nice!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Loving it. Mine is Silver Birch with a rear spoiler, power moonroof and nice tint. I have had mine for a week now. I test drove this 4 times to make sure I was not hallucinating. The power of the dohc v6 is excellent. I would have bought the 4 cylinder if the deal would not have worked out on the v6. The styling is strong, distinguished, classy, understated, smart and masculine with "man-grille" up front anchoring this good handling ride resting on sweet styled 17" alloys. Handling is great for this segment. Fit and finish makes this easily the best Ford sedan ever. It is the "poor mans" CTS and does have Caddy drivers looking.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior stands out and makes this car unique in its class. All the Japanese imports look alike and frankly they all need ground effects to be noticed. The Fusion looks strong, sleek and husky with out ground effects. Nice wheels, spoiler, grille and lights. Nice interior, a huge step for Ford.</FAVORITE>

Put on 2500 miles in less than a month. Very comfortable for long drives and averaged 28 mpg! Comfortably seats 4 (took a trip with three friends, shortest being 6'1", and everyone had plenty of room).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am getting 27mpg in mixed driving. I love the smooth ride and the way it corners. You really have to look at the appearance package - it comes with leather-like seats with black and red cloth inserts, 17" wheels, smoke chrome grill, upgraded radio (I love the iPod jack that plays your iPod).The manual transmission has a nice feel. The fog lamps work very well.This package is only about $300 more. I also got the rear spoiler. Not one problem with car. Only thing I would suggest is after about a hundred miles I would open her up a little bit to seat the rings, I babied the car and found I was a quart and a half low on oil, so I set the rings. After adding oil, the more I drive the car the more I like it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This AWD model has the great handling I love in our Subaru. The engine is responsive enough for everyday driving. Some people complain it's underpowered but for the price and package it's a great value. If you want Mustang or Corvette speeds, go get one of them. This car handles a turn like a wide receiver - sure-footed and quick. Some people complain about road noise but I haven't found it objectionable. My son said the engine, when revved hard, sounds "like Lightning McQueen" (from the movie Cars). That's fine with me. The other feature I enjoy is spacious front and rear seating. I'm 6'4" and there's still room for a real person to sit behind me with no discomfort.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a pleasant family sedan. Even with the 4-cylinder, it cruises smoothly and quietly at highway speeds. I'm getting over 28 mpg (manual trans). Clutch engagement is easy and smooth. After driving more powerful cars, the biggest adjustment is I need to downshift to safely pass on two-lane roads. At 80-mph the engine is turning about 3500 RPM and sounds a little busy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Smooth, zippy, tight, quiet, with great appeal, inside and out. I bought this car for my daughter and she loves it. We looked at/test drove Cobalts and Focuses first and then found that the Fusion is way worth the extra $1,500 we paid. Only driven it 300 miles so far, but it truly is a quality car at a great price. The 5M is gutsy, quick, and feels like a 6-cylinder, not a 4 banger. Visibility is excellent in all directions.

<TEXT>I waited to review this vehicle, because I really wanted to try it for a month before giving my final impression. One thing that I've like about what Ford has done with their cars has been the conservative design of the interiors. Nothing flashy, everything is in a place that makes sense, and the quality feels fine. Some people have complained about engine noise on the 4 cylinder, but I don't think it's that obnoxious. It's a fun to drive car for a mid-size. I'm impressed with the fuel economy, it gets about as good of mileage as the Focus I used to own. It makes my 30 mile commute to work painless, I enjoy driving with this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really do like this car, but the only problem is that there isn't enough power. I would've gone for the V6, but they didn't have it in a manual. In any case, the reliability and build quality of the car is great (my family has owned 4 Fords in the past and this is definitely the best). The interior isn't any worse than the Accord or Camry, but all three are pretty ugly. The interior design is simple (which is a good thing) and the leather wrapped stick feels great to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The display for MPG, distance to empty, trip time, trip distance, etc. Very helpful when I'm driving up and down the 5. Also, the moonroof is a great addition, although may not be worth the extra $600. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was originally thinking about an Impala or used Camry. I am very glad I chose the Fusion. I have averaged 32- 34 MPG on two lane highway, 29-30 MPG on interstate and overall about 27 MPG. We have one young child under a year old and have plenty of room for everything during our long trips home (~400 miles). The only drawback is turning radius which I was aware of before buying the car, but it does not turn on a dime, more like a nickel. I have 13,000 miles on it already and have enjoyed them all. I drove several late model Dakota's previously and this car is just as fun and enjoyable to drive. I recommend it fully.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first new car, purchased for college and expecting 15k a year. So far I'm impressed with the car - it's comfy with a nice ride and it's quiet. It's practical with lots of room for people and things but also fun to drive thanks to the great handling. I purchased the awd model due to where I live - we get snow; in fact the day I bought it I drove home in snow very confidently, car has lots of grip. Only things I can think of needing to be addressed are build quality (just a bit) fuel economy could be better I think and the engine could be better which I hear is on the way (but even that engine now used in the MKZ isn't so great). Mine was loaded except for navigation system. I paid $24,000.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very sensible - sedan but feels like a coupe...very good handling (and I don't prefer front wheel drives) very easy on fuel unless you jump on it, but the power is there when you demand it. That's because of a very well tuned six speed transmission. Definitely go for the six cylinder six speed auto transmission...smooth power, less hard working engine. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It doesn't have those stupid "Objects in mirror may be larger than they appear" jive etched into the mirrors. (OK, seems picayune, but I'm glad they got that out of their system).

The Ford Fusion saved me over $7k and it was a practical purchase. My vehicle is fully loaded without the Navigation System and the spoiler. This is my fourth brand new vehicle from Ford that I have purchased over the last 15 years and so far I had a very good experience. I had a 1992 Ford Thunderbird with over 180k miles and recently a 2003 Ford Focus ZX3 with over 60k miles. I highly recommend this vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have always owned Hondas, but I decided to trade in my Accord on a brand new Fusion. It was a great idea. Instead of having to put aftermarket parts on my car to make it be appealing, the Fusion already comes with chromed-two tone leather-carbon fiber dash-and nice head and tail lights. I have mine in black with black and grey leather...it looks better and is just as reliable as any factory Honda out there. So why would anyone pay more for a Honda, my Fusion is one of the best ideas I've had in a long time</TEXT>

<TEXT>My new Fusion is awesome. Bought it new with 3k miles on it, the dealership used it for the commercial accounts salesman. It is the SEL model with auto transmission, and 4 cylinder engine. It drives great, the suspension and handling make it extremely fun to drive. I have gotten as high as 37 mpg on a trip from Bangor ME to Coventry RI, about 338 miles; that was a little bit more than a half of tank. I was skeptical about getting a 4 cylinder, but it has some good pep when needed, so no complaints. I was told the 4 cylinder was the same engine used in the Ford Probe. I have never been a fan of Ford, but this Fusion has changed my mind.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Fusion without ever seeing one in person and I really love this car. Gas mileage has been up to and over 30 MPG from the beginning. I also don't have any problems getting started from a full stop of punching the pedal to get out of a tight situation. The reports of slow response to gas pedal input just aren't as bad as they are made out to be. I am also 6'4" tall and have zero issues with leg and head room. I also have no problems with the turning radius. My previous vehicle was a Ranger which had a larger turning radius, so the Fusion's tighter turning is a nice change of pace.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got the car and drove it to PA from Texas and back. Mileage averaged about 26.5. No problems. Torque steer a bit strong. Transmission somewhat hesitant to upshift. Tight steering and no flutter in the rain. Overall seems like a good deal for the money. Was about $3K less than an Altima with comparable fit, finish, and performance (I own two Altimas). Not going to get excitement but a solid competent, cost effective performer. I paid about $22.3 for it so the deal wasn't super but it wasn't bad either.

<TEXT>I bought my 07 Fusion w/ 30k on it last year, and it is a great, all-around commuting car. It doesn't have the acceleration and power that I prefer, but it more than makes up for this as far as ride quality is concerned. It is one of the SMOOTHEST riding cars you'll ever have. I literally keep falling asleep while driving due to the low wide noise and smooth ride. The interior is very nice and neat, and of course the exterior meets a tame middleground between sophistication and sportiness. The seats aren't the comfiest, but they're good. So, if you have kids and a tight budget, and you're not a speedster, this is a great car. It's reliable and doesn't feel cheap.</TEXT>

It drives like a dream, looks like a concept car, feels like a luxury sedan, and costs half as much! I have been averaging about 28.5 MPG through mixed driving and I have a very heavy lead foot.

Good mpg, very comfortable and roomy, though those who are 6' or taller with long torsos may find head room a bit tight. After about 40,000 miles, no problems, averaging 27-30 mpg in mixed driving. 4 cyl a bit whiney but what ones aren't?

<TEXT>Getting rid of her Camaro, my wife needed a family car. We looked at the pricey Camry, Prius, Accord and Mazdas out there and landed on the Fusion. Mainly for the styling, room, and price tag. We bought it used with 10,800 miles on it. She does a 60/40 HWY/City driving that yields great mileage. Constantly getting 25 mpg in the city and 31-37 mpg on the highway. A recent 200 mile road trip yielded 34.8 mpg at 75 mph with A/C on and 4 people plus luggage in the vehicle. We really love the mp3 input jack that allows for unlimited music tunes through our trips. She drives 25 miles one way to work and gets an average of 30.6 mpg with her city/hwy driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been very disappointed with the quality if this car. I have had to replace a front wheel barring not 2 months after purchase and have had transmission problems this car does not have the power you can't pass unless your going down hill or have plenty of room it does not feel safe on the interstate. The battery terminal went bad and that had to be replaced too. The interior is cheap and the seats are already separating (I weigh only 125 lbs) and the trunk doesn't say open. As far as design and comfort I love it that is why I purchased this model. Unfortunately you'd better love it because there is no trade in value my $16,000 car is only worth $7,600 depreciated 1/2 in 8 months.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When my wife and I went shopping for a new vehicle for her, we were open minded, we spent the summer looking at just about every vehicle in our price range. We couldn't agree on anything, as goes with pretty much everything else. When we took a Ford Fusion out for a test drive, we both liked it. We did take a few other cars out for test drives, and nothing compared to the Fusion, and I knew we wouldnt be happy with anything else. We settled with the 4cyl, because she mainly drives around town. But I was shocked when our family went to visit relatives 200 miles away, and with our boys, 6 and 15 years old, who didnt once complain about being cramped, and a trunk load. still averaged 28.5 MPG. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's fun to drive. We like the overall appearance. And plenty of legroom which is hard to find in a midsize car. The 4 cyl engine is impressive. This was a well thought out car. And the stereo sounds awesome for a factory unit. If you are looking for a new vehicle, don't overlook the Fusion. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Planned on a Altima. The selling price gave me more car for my money. Overall quality is very good with the exception of noticable gaps along the door at the main pillar. The traction control has too much lag. It can be kind of irritating when getting started at a green light. The climate controls are set too low so I have to take my eyes off the raod to adjust. The four cylindar cruises very well on the highway. Road noise is very good for a car in this class. Rear visibility is not the best. The car handles very well. Taking a 270 degree off ramp at 50 mph is kind of fun. Overall, I would recommend this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall the car is just average. There is nothing amazing or fun or neat about the car. Seats are above average in terms of comfort. The car also has some decent visual appeal at first. However, the fuel economy stinks and the technology is outdated. Ford has improved on the reliability but still does not have great fit and finish. There are little rattles and weird clicking sounds. The engine flat out stinks. Needs dual vvti to help with power and gas consumption. Car also needs bigger output, possibly a 3.5 liter. If you are going to buy American Ford probably is your best bet but I only bought the car because I was on Ford's discount plan. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the car ,bought it because of the AWD,car is very functionable and lot's of space ,comfortable to drive. Had a Lincoln LS before and the finish and quality is right up there. Really like the storage compartment in the dash and media controls on the steering wheel.Fold down passeneger seat makes it very easy for carrying longer items. The AWD is awesome, freeway mileage is 32 -35 mpg, city mileage as low as 16 mpg with mild driving. Installed rear back-up sensors (offered in 2008) as rear visability is poor. I would definitely recommend this. I would absolutely buy another one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I own this Fusion SE for more than 1 year. You can not complain a lot on this car, except the power seat: I don't use it every month. It has no problem from the day I bought it. I drive almost all local and I can get 28/26 during summer/winter season, which is same gas mileage as my wife's Focus SE. It is better than my colleague's new Accord. I love the sound system and use it everyday. The power features are very convenient. Compared to Focus, it is so quiet. The computer is also a great feature. Now I hope it can be 10 years problems free. Best wish Ford can gain reputation again and be "proud to be made in America"! </TEXT>

<TEXT>No car can match the features in the same price range. Very pleased. Consistently gets over 35 mpg hwy, 30 city. Best was 40.1 mpg on a trip of 280 miles, fully loaded! Most of car (60% +) is Mazda 6, platform, so this is no recycled Taurus. Very agile at 3100 lbs, brakes stop hard, and 4 banger has same acceleration as a 5 cyl Jetta. Seats are super comfortable, and trunk is large, equal to my midsize cougar. Best bang for the buck. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased this car in January 2007. It had great gas mileage and is a very very good looking car in my opinion. There were only a few things I think should be changed. The 4 cylinder really lacks power, to the point it drove me crazy! The 6 cylinder would make it a wonderful car! The only problem I had was the brakes making a snapping sound, especially braking after backing up, I saw several different Fusions that had that problem. Other than that it was an awesome car. Very reliable and solid, I think Ford did a great job with this car overall.</TEXT>

When I drive conservatively I can get 30mpg on the expressway. My combined mileage with the V6 is 23mpg with a 50/50 mix of driving. No squeaks and rattles. No expensive dealer service. Oil changes every 6k miles with Mobile 1 and K&N oil filter. This is a great car. Sirius is great! Only nit to pick is that the AC/heat blower could be a little quieter. Seats are also very comfortable for long trips! Go drive a Ford! Oh and this is from a former Honda owner! </TEXT>

The handling is great which is what makes this car fun. The leather seats are very comfortable and the interior is modern and uncluttered which I like. The quality has been impeccable. The car has not had so much as a loose piece of trim. Hats off to Ford.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Make many 2000-mile round trips for work. At 6'0 240 lbs., '05 Civic was cramped. Intended to get an Accord, but they weren't dealing. Heard Ford was, so checked out Fusion. Have 11000 mi. almost exclusive long highway drives on this Fusion. Great combo of power, comfort, and fuel mileage. Doesn't seem to be geared to be peppy at low speeds (compared to Civic), but going 90 before you know it; and handles very well on open highway. Noticeably less road noise than Civic. I cruise between 70 mph and 80 mph and get 31 mpg on trips. Seat adjustable enough to get comfortable with plenty of leg room. Same with steering wheel. Very happy with this vehicle - and wife really likes it too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Rented this car while mine was in the shop for one week. Initial reaction. No low end torque (read: no get up and go)but nice and responsive when anywhere past 20Kmph. Quick sporty feel, handled well. Very pleasently surprised with this Ford product. Compared to a seven year old Civic it rattles far more when the stereo is turned up showing, to a degree, overall build quality. Very enjoyable drive and I will miss it although it would be in tough competition when I buy next. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great responsiveness, great looks, nice stereo in the upgraded SE. Plenty of power to weave and pass.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After many months of research and driving other vehicles, I finally found the car that fit me! I have a modified 91 Mustang GT 5.0, so I like fast cars that handle great. The V6 SEL AWD Fusion does both! The 221 HP is great, and not near as sluggish as the Buick Lucerne V6 that I drove. Not to mention the racey grille and spoiler! The interior is awesome- I got the Med. Light Stone leather interior and the Audiophile stereo system which rocks! The exterior is black. Only change I plan to do is to have the windows tinted. I get stares and comments (good ones) from Chevy owners. Ford did a great job with this car! Blue Oval Proud!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling, smooth transmission, AWD handling. Interior layout. Am getting 21 mpg, which is pretty good since I'm trying to adjust to an automatic tranny after 16 yrs. of driving vehicles with 5 speed transmissions. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have to admit, I like Fords so I may be a bit biased. However I also like quality. The Fusion gives me the best of both worlds. This car is a real winner and I have encouaged people to drive this car. I owned a 2000 BMW 328i with a sport suspension and I think the Fusion handles nearly as well. I would have never believed it had I not driven the car, but it's very impressive. The V6 has plenty of power and I really like the 6-speed auto. There's a little initial hesitation with a good stomp on the accelerator but the higher-end torque is nice. On top of that, it's a sharp looking car that people notice. Ford did a great job with the Fusion and hopefully they'll sell many of them.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling & performance is fantastic particularly in AWD model. It corners like a champ and is very solid in heavy rain (bring on the snow) The stying is impressive too - great looking car. One-touch sunroof controls. Multiple 12V power points a plus. Trunk very roomy. Instrument panel is attractive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Surprise! Ford really means it when they say this car can beat the Camry and Accord. Don't take their word for it, give it a try. Eerily quiet, smooth, elegant interior with the leather package, smooth-shifting six- speed automatic, and decent fuel economy at 25 MPG in mixed driving with the V-6.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sits high for its size, interior is very tasteful, smooth in every aspect, strong useful acceleration with the V-6 and the six-speed automatic.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My husband bought the Fusion for me for my birthday and I totally love it! I do have to say that I am a first time Ford owner (I never thought I would say that!) I am very impressed with the reliability, safety features and overall design. Not to mention the 25 MPG (HWY miles)! The cost is very reasonable for all of the gadgets and accessories the SEL V6 comes with. The sunroof has also impressed me, it is much quieter than what I expected when it is completely open. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6 Disc in dash and satelite radio. Great MPG, controls on the steering wheel. All of the air bags. Large trunk and large cup holders; perfect for traveling. The analog clock is a nice touch. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Ford Fusion is not the most refined or most powerful sedan, but it is adequately powered and handles better than any sedan in its class. If you are looking for a car that is fun to drive and looks great, you should at least give the all-wheel drive Fusion a test drive. This car responds to steering input instantly and it just sticks to the road. The Fusion not only handles great, but it also has a very comfortable ride. The interior is not flashy with a lot of gimmicks. It is a simple and straightforward design that I have always enjoyed from Ford. The seats are comfortable</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All wheel drive, great handling and comfortable ride, good factory stereo sound, simple but clean interior design. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is fun to drive. It has the extra kick I was looking for without having to move all the way up to the sports car class. Also looks great, I still get plenty of comments.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>V6 has reasonable power at a good price. Not quite a Mustang but it still moves when I accellerate. Heated leather and automatic AC.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only had my car for 2 months. I purchased it used. It was just something about this car that I had to have. I even had the dealership go out and find this specific car. I must say I am very pleased with it. I love the way it feels and the way it drives. Not to mention, I get lots of compliments on this car. I love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>While driving to work in my 2005 F150 Lariat and complaining about the price of gas I thought I all ready have a F350 how many trucks do I need. Went on Fords web page and looked at what cars they had to offer. Loved the looks and capabilities of the SEL awd. Went out and traded in my dream truck for a 2007 Merlot V6 awd SEL. Now 6000 miles later in 3 months I still love it. I'm averaging 27.4 mpg mixed driving. Car handles like a dream. My 16 and 18 year old daughters think it's a cool car too.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Picked up a loaded 2007 SEL AWD. Ablast to drive and comfortable too. Have NAV and sunroof. All in all love this car for the price. I get 21 mpg around town driving as fast as I can go in an AWD car. Pleasure to drive on the highway. Nice Job Ford.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD, avg 21mpg but it just begs you to floor it everywhere you go. Fast enough to be fun, but not so fast it's scary, and M3 it's not.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ford really put out a great car to replace the Taurus even though they turned around and brought it back. The Fusion makes everyones heads turn if you know how to fix one up. From the 16 year old Fast and Furious wanna bees to the 70 year old church driver the Fusion is the car to want. Great driving and great looks. I love my Black Beauty!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The design is one of the best that Ford has came out with in several years.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is simply awesome! I just bought the 07 SEL V6 (sans AWD), and it will scoot! It feels like much more power than 221 hp, at least for someone trading in a 3.0 Ranger. The exterior styling is absolutely stunning, while the interior is elegant. The price is great as well. I simply took in my truck, told them what I wanted, where I needed to be in the payment, and drove off the lot a happy man. I would reccomend this car to anyone. Truthfully, one of the best values on the market! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Chrome grille, clear taillights. Info panel, a/c and audio controls on steering wheel, audio input jack. Comfortable seats, white stiching for the black leather, fold down front passenger seat, key fob, roomy, audio system loads MP3 cd's and switches folders quickly. The engine!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is OK. It isn't the greatest, and it isn't the worst. It is comfortable, but underpowered with the 4 cylinder engine. An Accord or Camry would leave this car in the dust. My car had door panels which rattled, and rather than waste my valuable time going back to the dealer, I tightened the screws myself. Where is quality control? Anyway....the car rides nice, and it is obvious that American car making has improved a lot. Regardless, for what amounts to the same price as an Accord or Camry, this car is missing "the little things", things like a coin holder built into the center console, and a locking gas cap.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Sportiness, roominess, quality, reliability, good price, good MPG, good looks. These items don't usually all go together in the same car. I like all the thoughtful features on my SEL, puddle lamps, heated mirrors, lumbar support, telescoping steering wheel, climate control, compass. These are great things that often get thrifted out. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased my Fusion at the end of April '07. I have driven the car 10,000 miles since I have driven it out of state including two road trips from Detroit to Charlotte, NC. The car has no squeaks or rattles. The headliner near the power sunroof was not finished properly at the factory and the edges of the material were mis cut and has a visible open material edge. That is the only flaw in the entire vehicle. I owned a Cadillac Catera and other luxury vehilcles in the past. This car rivals them for style, performance, quality and features at a much lower price point. This car is an excellent value and a good quality, reliable alternative to buying foreign</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>IPOD jack, Sirius satellite radio, power moonroof. Handling the twisties! The overall look of the vehilce. Quality assembly materials in the interior</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I opted for the Fusion as my first experience away from Toyota. I have owned a 2002 Tacoma, 2004 Matrix, 2006 Corolla, 2006 RAV-4 and 2006 Tundra. The Fusion was an amazing value at $15,977 for the Automatic S. I could not believe all the standard features on this so called "stripped down" model. Great Stereo, and awesome fit & finish. Added 18" Rims and now this car looks like a 25K luxury auto! Could not be happier with the peppy gas sipping 4-cyl. Ford did it right and now we are considering an Edge for the family SUV!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The price. Aside from that, everything that was included standard on the S. AC Auto door locks/windows, keyless entry, CD/MP3 stereo (sounds great w/ only 4 speakers).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When compared to other models in this class this vehicle is a steal. The performance, comfort, style taken into effect this vehicle should start at $24,000 but who is complaining.Test drive Fusion, Camry, and Accord,and see for yourself, plus you can keep several grand in your pocket.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very responsive, plenty of torque, at its best when driving in the higher rpms. Acceleration coming out of a curve is great, this car just hugs the pavement and wants to perform for you.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have loved this car since it was introduced in 2006 and when I got the chance to get a new car, I immediately looked for a Fusion. It's a great car, fun to drive and very reliable It packs a large punch that you might not expect from a V4.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After searching for months, I came back to the Fusion. This car is a winner! The styling is unique. The V-6 is worth a little less MPG than the 4 cyl. - as it shifts flaulessly, is very quiet and has plenty of power when needed. By far the handling is the best. After learning the underpinnings are from Volvo, "no wonder!" I thought - as my last 2 cars were Volvo and this car handles like no other import car. The interior is fresh and simple - not gaudy like Camrys' fake beach glass glowing controls and old folks boring "bisque" color scheme. Get all the options even if you think you don't need them - I did and I'm glad - very good value. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great handling,fully adjustable steering wheel. Like all the backlit buttons during night. The spoiler is a must - it frees up the backwindow view, is not flashy, and has LED lights! The Auto Climate control is great as are SEL steering wheel controls.</FAVORITE>
