<TEXT>as of 10/19/09 I have taken this vehicle to the dealer at least 6 times. it lights up like a christmas tree inside the dash board. check engine light, steering wheel, tire monitor all stay lit up and dealer can't seem to find the problem. I quess what they say, you pay for what you get is true, the forenza is cheap and is not worth the aggravation that comes with this car. I would not advise anyone to purchase this car, or you will be mad as hell the way that I am.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car new. Since then I had to have my passenger door painted. My windshield wipers are rusted my rear view mirror always has a vibration. Also like many others I had a door handle break. Now every time I drive my car looses the gas my car looses speed. Now it has a leak under the engine as well. This is very unsafe and of course they tell my nothing is wrong with my car. Not reliabe and not safe. Worst car ever I will never buy another Suzuki. Don't waste your money no wonder they don't make these cars anymore.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this car EXCEPT that the door handles have broken 3 times!!! And, the paint on my door handles is peeling off! We bought this 2007 model in 2008 with a new full warranty, so the door handles have been replaced for free each time. But, it is a pain to schedule and appointment to have it done. Also, I feel like the dealership thinks I'm crazy and that I am actually abusing the door handles and breaking them. But, I am paying the bill each month and I expect it to work properly. I must say I am very happy with this car- especially the air conditioning, speed and gas mileage. I was worth every penny!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>So, bought the car in Aug 2007, first month it was in shop 3 times for a vibration/shake. They finally after first aligning, rotating and balancing tires, then supposedly replaced tires because they claimed there were flat spots figured out it was bent wheel axles!! Then again in the shop 3 weeks ago as the engine seemed to have a strain on it and then wouldn't drive. They claimed it was the sensor in the transmission, then got it from the dealer and that same day they had to have it towed as it would not shift into gear at all!! They told me they replaced the shifter cables. On the first time into the shop for the transmission they told me the radiator was never bolted into the car!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I will have to say that despite all of the negative reviews on the gas milleage, mine does great. I usually get 25 mpg which is a giant step up from a SUV that only got 16-17 mpg. I mainly drive city too. The car is inexpensive b/c that's how it was built. So naturally there are downsides to it. The one I hate the most is the paint wearing out on most everything on the interior. It just would have been better to leave it the grey or tan plastic colors undernear. There is one more thing I don't like -- whenever I start it up and immediately shift gears, it will "jump" really quick and then will return to normal. Other than the above complaints, it's been a great car so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car used with 13K miles on it. Now I have 29K and I am really beginning to hate it. In the last year I have replaced 3 door handles, 2 sensors for oil pressure, and the tachometer just quit working. My overall thought on the car, it was a good attempt but it stinks. If you are looking into buying a car like this, my best advise to you would be dont buy it. P.S. Tires are ridiculously hard to find and are very expensive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My husband and I purchased our Suzuki Forenza in August 2007. We have been satisfied with it until about a month ago when two door handles broke off, so we took it and had them fixed. At that time, for some reason the service tech did not know how to get our car out of gear and a spring was broke in our gear shift. We got that fixed. Now, two days ago, I was driving to work and the car slipped out of gear by itself and went into neutral. I immediately took it back to the dealer and they put a transmission relay switch? on it. Within the last month, I have had the car at the dealer's 3 times. Not very satisfied with this car at this time. Would never buy another one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The interior door handles broke on the front driver and passenger sides. Electrical issues....Occasionally, the emergency lights flash when opening the door and will stop when the ignition is turned on..several trips has been made to the dealer but they cannot find the problem. It also causes the AC to randomly blow hot and cold air while in the on position.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for two years and i have had nothing but bad things to say about it ever since. It was labeled as getting 31 MPG highway, estimated. It gets 24 MPG highway. With the fuel costs over the past couple years, it almost killed me to drive this car. I had to fill up about every 3 days to get back and forth to work. The inside passenger door handle broke off in my wifes hand a few weeks back. High quality plastic that stuff is. Now the break pedal gets stuck and makes my taillight stay on and drained my battery the other night. The fans inside the engine well came loose when 3 of the four bolts fell out, now the hood release wont work either and I cant keep my hood closed. JUNK!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like driving this car because it looks good and it's pretty roomy for a sedan. Going from a Corolla to this the extra room is amazing. Perfect for the baby car seat that I have to fit in the back. Not a problem with it so far and it's at about 25000 miles now. The manual shifts great and the speed is suitable enough for a four cylinder.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car for my 60 mile one way commute to work. I only bought it because it was cheap as it was a 2007 I bought in 2008 from a new dealership. At this point I would definitely reccomend this car to anyone. It has decent pickup (No race car) great highway mileage, and has cruise, cd, MP3, A/C and the works. No reliability issues either. I am still a truck guy, but for a compact, I love my Forenza.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I get about 20-25mpg, driving about 70% highway, 30% city. I guess that's average these days. The acceleration isn't great, at least with the automatic transmission. After about 6 months, the inside passenger door handle snapped off when my sister(weighs maybe 100 lbs) was getting out the car. Sometimes I smell freon when using the AC (inside air). Let's hope the warranty covers those!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for 10 months and put 20,000 miles on it. It's very dependable and very spacious in the back seat for my two toddlers, I even have room for a third child, if needed. The trunk is huge for lots of storage. Sometimes when you go over 85 mph, it starts to shimmy a little. The gas mileage is alright, not the best, but not the worst either. Overall, a great car at an affordable price. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I needed a car that was reliable and I didn't have to spend a fortune on. While browsing for a few days I came across this car that only had 8500 miles on it for $9980. One reason for the price drop was they dealer took the stock rims off and replaced them with 15 inch black rims with hubcaps on them. That was alright with me though because I can always replace that. My Forenza is a manual transmission and unlike what other reviews have said on some Forenzas mine accelerates perfectly fine. The one and only complaint so far that I have about this car is that if the tires pressure is not perfect I get a light on in the car because of the TPMS. Overall though, good car so far!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roominess of the car. In it's class I think that it is actually one of the best. I for one like the exterior design also.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ive driven the Forenza now for 6000 miles and the mpg on it the last 3 months has been awful. 12mpg 3 tankfulls in a row(unacceptable) and that's city driving. Summer highway driving was ok (27-29) but if I were to buy it again I would get a manual tranny. Ive read it does better on the mpg. Other than that cars been ok. Power is enough for my needs. Just one issue with an engine light had it checked when I went for oil change.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall this car is a good value for the money. We bought this car on functionality and overall price. We have been fairly pleased. The car performs more or less as promised. Handling is good and power is ok. The mpg has been less than average in the city and better than average on the highway. The car get 15-16 in the city for us, but over 30 on the highway. We have had to take the car in 3 times in less than two years. The orginal tires where horrible, felt like they were out of balance and this grew worse with time. Two times they checked the balance issue, stating it was a tire issue. This has been fixed with different tires. Also we have had a cold idle issue too. 16,000 mi.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My boyfriend and I bought our Suzuki Forenza about a week ago and I love it! Although ours is a 2008, it's still similiar to the 2007. It's a great vehicle. The exterior design of the car is excellent, and the interior has more than enough room. We have two small children and we are both still young ourselves, so the exterior and interior fit our needs very well. It's a great vehicle and I would recommend it to anyone!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased my Forenza, and love the fact that it's a 5-speed manual. I replaced the factory tires with the rims off my trade-in. Big leap for me from a 92 accord with 347,321 miles to a brand new Forenza with 54 miles. Love the car for the price. I looked into a newer model Honda (04,05,06) but they were just as pricey but without the warranty, so I chose the Forenza with the warranty. With the way I drive it'll be 10 years before I hit 100,000 miles. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my Forenza! I have the '07 black/premium package with leather interior and spoiler. I haven't had any problems with it. If you are the type of driver who likes to zig-zag in and out of traffic this car is not for you because the acceleration speed is moderate. I was a little disapointed with the gas mileage at first but I now put mid-grade gas to get better mileage and ride. The good really outweighs the bad. You can't have luxury expectations when driving a economy car! This car is doing just fine for me </TEXT>

<TEXT>Hey, I really love this car. I think it's awesome. I have not had any problems with it and I love taking curves fast and driving fast. I only pay $200 a month for it and I put zero down also. It is not a bad car at all. If you go buy one, don't forget to ask for the $1,000 rebate. It puts the car at less than $14,500 for the 2007 model. If you find a 2006 model you can get it for $13,500. I read the complaints that some have about the resale value. Well you just bought a new car you can't expect to resell it for more...it's not house. The best thing to do is just hold on to it and have fun with it hey it does have a great warranty and it looks really good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car looks quite nice from the outside. It also comes standard with air conditioning, a CD player, and heated mirrors. However I have had multiple starting problems with this car even though my Suzuki dealer claims this problem is limited to the '06 models. It also gets bad gas mileage when compared to other compact cars. I was driving a SUV so I did not notice it at first, but 21 mpg for a compact is bad. Also, the automatic transmission sucks too much power away from the already small inefficient engine. When I am going up a hill on the interstate I have to keep my foot on the floor and still lose speed. The engine is also quite noisy and does not like to go above 60 mph. Do not buy this car.</TEXT>
