<TEXT>I own a 2005 BMW 530I and have owned Mercedes, a 1999 JagXJ8, and love cars. The Camry Hybrid has better acceleration then you would think. If I drive it rather hard I average about 33 miles per gallon. If I try to not accelerate on every stop I can get up to 38 miles per gallon. This is not bad when you consider the size of the car, comfort, styling and for the price compared to the higher priced cars a very good deal.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2007 Camry hybrid used a little over a year ago. Hands down the best car I've ever had. Its quiet, smooth and has all the power you'll ever need. With the CVT transmission there's no shifting. Most people think hybird = no power. I'm 51 years old and this car has as much power as any that I've ever owned. I bought my Camry with 59,000 miles on it. It now has 78,000 miles on it. I've only had 1 problem. It didn't start at 20 below zero. I can't wait to see how long my brakes last. I was told 200,000 to 300,000 miles they look great so far. Oh I almost forgot I get between 38 to 41 mpg March though November and about 35 to 38 mpg in the winter.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Wow where do I start. I think the biggest for me is the low mait. CVT transmission, braking system, mpg, hands free phone, and all the safety features .</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Hands down the best car I have ever owned! I put 60,000 miles on it in two years and have not had to do a thing except change the oil, and that only has to be done every 6,000 miles! Just had it in the dealer for normal service and they told me the brakes look new!!!!! How is this possible. GO BUY ONE AND IT WILL BE THE BEST CAR YOU'LL EVER OWN.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I work in outside sales and drive 30-35,000 miles per year. I have 73,000 miles on my 2007 Camry Hybrid. This is my third Toyota car and in over 350,000 miles of driving them, the only non-regular maintenance replacement was a water pump on my 2000 Camry at 142,000 miles. My son still has that car with 176,000 miles on it. I love my Camry Hybrid. I don't know about other reports about tires. Mine came with lifetime free tires and oil change. They just put on new tires at 72,000 miles. The old ones had just hit the wear markers. My only complaint would be that the ride is a little mushy. At this point I prefer comfort to racing performance, and this car is very comfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is absolutely the best car I've ever owned, and I've owned a lot. It is very well thought out, fun to drive, carries all the luggage my family of five needs for a long trip, and the fuel economy is typically 40 mpg or better. As a mechanical engineer I'm quite impressed with how this car is put together, specifically the merging of the gas engine and electric motor to the transmission. The seamless crossover in power supply is awesome. I'm about to go buy another hybrid Camry, something I never thought I'd do.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy is twice what my other vehicles are, translating into half- price gas, which is very welcome right now! Now that hands-free calling is required in my state, the Blutooth capability has turned into a wonderfully useful benefit.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We are now approaching 30,000 miles and the good news is that the car has had nothing but routine maintenance. Mileage is as advertised but dips into the high 20's in winter city driving. The OEM tires were shot at 22K which is not acceptable. The dashboard creaks like Noah's Ark, especially when cold and the interior plastics and fit and finish are below par. The car is a quiet and comfortable cruiser and is as non offensive as you would expect from a Camry. Power is great for a hybrid in this fuel mileage class. The cruise control in un-nerving in the hills - set it at 75 and it will vary between 72 and 78. Overall we are pleased but this is not a great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted to write this review for two reasons. First, to indicate my impressions on the car. Second about Edmunds ratings. The car itself has been great and all that was advertised. I have averaged about 36 MPG, 42 on highway trips. The trunk is smaller than a normal Camry, but it has enough height to make it very usable. I have it loaded with leather and Nav, most people don't really see the difference between this and another loaded Camry. Very please thus far and have had no problems. Edmunds seems to rate this vehicle low, but i don't think they rate almost any hybrid high unless it is like the high end Lexus LS ($100K). Edmunds tends to rate on pure power and not usability</TEXT>

<TEXT>My hybrid rocks! I average 32.5-36 MPG in mixed driving over numerous foothills. And that's with aggressive, always first off the blocks, fastest on the highway driving. With highway trips, I will easily exceed the max 40 MPG average on the dash readout, especially when I adopt more hybrid-like driving habits, i.e. drafting large trucks, timing stop lights, and not speeding. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, I love my Camry hybrid. It's got great features, it's good looking and it's super quiet. I had an old Toyota Avalon v6 before which was more powerful then my new Camry and I still remember v6 performance. This Camry could be a little faster, but you can't complain averaging 36 mpg (50% highway, 50% city). Mileage is all about the way you drive anyway. You can get as high as 45-46 mpg in a city or as low as 30 mpg when you do not care at all on a highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After reading multiple reviews, I decided to test drive the Camry. The first thing I noticed was the silence; this car is quiet. The only time you will really hear the engine is if you punch the accelerator. If you drive cautiously and conscientiously, slowly accelerating and decelerating, you will definitely get 38-39 MPG. I'm averaging 500 miles to a tank. The extras: MP3 stereo, leather, sunroof, GPS, bluetooth make this by far the most geeked out car I've owned. The ride is smooth, if not really exciting, but then again, on a long trip you won't be stopping for gas as much either ;). The hybrid batteries do take up some room in the trunk, but I can still fit a full size cooler in.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The bluetooth capability for hands-free cell phone use is a huge safety feature. Every time you drive the car, it will track your fuel consumption and relays your average when you turn off the car (even going so far as to grade your performance: over 36 MPG, the car gives you an excellent rate).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I picked up my car on 3/30. My dealer had to trade for the color I wanted, Gray Metallic. I rode along with the transporter to make sure he kept the speed under 65. He was wonderful, and kept it under 60. I had the opportunity to listen and watch as he drove. At most times you had a hard time knowing if the car had not stalled, since it was so quiet. We drove 100 miles back to the dealer and it averaged 38 mpg. On my drive home, it averaged 41 mpg. It had little road noice since it comes with Michelin Energy MXV4-S8s. I also have a 2006 Camry Solara SLE Conv't. I will never again buy anything but Toyota!!</TEXT>

The Camry Hybrid is not going to win awards for performance (though it is not bad, just kind of average), but it is well designed and looks great. It also gets great gas mileage (I am getting 36 mpg so far). Well worth the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is amazing! I vow to buy Toyota hybrids for the rest of my life! It's pretty powerful, very safe, and beautiful, and of course GREAT on gas! There is plenty of rear space, and front space as well, and lots of cubby holes to stash your stuff. The stereo is pretty good. I can go on and on, but I won't because everything I have to say is positive! GO BUY THIS CAR! And today the Brake Assist System prevented me from getting into an accident! Was blinded by the sun, and almost went through an red light, but the brakes just clamped and the car stopped on a dime, honestly! I never stopped in such a short distance with any other car!

<TEXT>Owned car for 2 months. No rattles/squeaks mentioned in other forums. Perfect commuter. Road noise is noticeable but tolerable & easily over come by excellent stereo. TCH has virtually no engine compression braking, so it coasts great for good mileage, however this leads to more than normal use of brakes in hilly country. This is really noticeable when driving on slippery roads. You can?t use compression braking to slow down & the CVT has no lower gears to shift into. Shifting the CVT into ?brake? mode slows the car dramatically if there's enough initial speed to generate regenerative braking. May be why ABS, stability/ traction control & airbags everwhere are standard.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had Camry Hybrid for about 6 months (6,000 mi). Overall, I am very pleased with the performance of the car. The ride is smooth, the engine works with aplomb, and the brakes are superbly effective. The keyless system is great once you get used to it. In the minus column, my center console constantly squeaks unless riding on a perfectly smooth road. The dealer so far has been unable to fix it. My second gripe is that water collects on the exterior lower door sills (usually dirty road water). This may not seem like a big deal, but sooner or later your pants will brush up against this water (in my case sooner and often). Keep a spare pair in the trunk.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had it for 3 weeks and about 1200 miles. We are just thrilled with this car! The combination of sophistication, engineering, convenience features, styling and value are unbelieveable! The quality is excellent -- first car we ever bought that did not have to go back for any "adjustments". It is fun and nimble and incredibly silent. Pick up is fair, but if you step on it the engine and electric motor together give it some kick. Mileage in January has been 34-35. The single setting heated seats work very well. The turquoise center stack around the nav screen is too bright and when you dim it the gauges are not bright enough. Try an after market interior wood kit -- awesome!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my hybrid on the 6th of Jan 07... beautiful car inside/out. Bought it fully loaded ie: nav/leather & comfort pkg. Took it for a business trip to Sacramento (approx 400 miles R/T) and averaged 37.8 mpg highway miles and I believe the mileage will improve slightly as I drive it more. The voice activated Nav system is easy to figure out, hands free blue tooth is awesome, keyless start is a beautiful thing, very comfortable leather seating. The exterior looks as good if not better than the Lexus ES 350. Got lucky and got the exterior color I wanted (jasper pearl), there was one with that color in California and it is mine. It's a head turner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I came from a Lexus ES 300 and I very seriously looked at the ES 350. The ES 350 was $8,000 more and was not as smooth or quiet as the Camry Hybrid. The ES has 90 more HP, but the Hybrid accelerates smoother and almost as strongly as did the ES. It is much quieter. I of course love the 36+ MPG that I'm getting on regular gas. The big short fall is the lack of memory seating and trunk size. The Bluetooth phone works great. </TEXT>

<TEXT>For about six months, I researched the TCH and finally purchased it in December. I love driving this car. I am consistently averaging between 38-40 mpg both city/highway. The power and acceleration are adequate and I'm saying this coming from a six cylinder Nissan Maxima. The interior is great, despite the plastic everywhere and the exterior...well, the few times that I had to go to the gas station (and other places) I always get great comments about the look. TCH...I'm lovin' it! If you are wondering if you should buy this car, wonder no more. If I based my selection on the test drive, I probably would have missed out, but now that I own it, it's a dream to drive</TEXT>

If I drove more in the city I could easily avg 42-44. The car teaches you how to drive it. Yes, it ultimatley means less aggressive driving, but that's not a bad thing.

It really deserves to be Motor Trend's Car of the Year! You deserve it, go by one! I did!

<TEXT>The vehicle is fantastic. Toyota took a major step up with the new Camry and the hybrid system is a pleasant plus. Fuel economy started at about 36 MPG and is now about 39 MPG with a daily city/freeway comute of 75 miles (13,000 miles on the car now). The ride, handling, interior quiet and interior creature comforts are excellent. Performance is comparable to our 2001 Avalon with better low end torque. The CVT transmission is a dream. We were considering the new ES 350 but opted for the Camry Hybrid instead. We are very happy with our choice. This car is very near the ES 350 in fit, finish and features at a lower cost and excellent fuel economy.</TEXT>

This is my first Toyota and I have always heard about there great quality. So far, the satellite radio and bluetooth have been replaced, the heater/ac controls are getting replaced, the driver's sun visor has fallen off, the remote start only has worked once, the center console pulled apart removing a phone charger, the passenger map light died and all this in only 4000 miles.

Not only does it nearly eliminate all wind noise, on the freeway, it is so quiet that it makes listening to music a sheer joy. The mpg indicator have even prompted me to decrease interstate speed to decrease the mpg indicator (as it decreases it show greater mpg). The control panel is a joy, not only to view how many miles I've traveled since starting the car, but also to view the actual mpg being recorded since last fill up, even thought I continue to zero the odometer & do the mental calculations.

<TEXT>I have had my Camry hybrid for about 2 months now, I sold my 2005 Subaru WRX STI and although I gave up some performance, I have been pleasantly surprised by the Camry's acceleration and handling. Intergration of the gas and electric modes is almost seamless and the CV transmission is great, all typical Toyota. I live the mountains of northeast Nevada, 6,500 ft elevation, and most of my driving is on the highway and in mountains, not hills. Mileage has been averaging around 35 mpg and thats not taking it easy trying for good milage, 80-90 mph is not uncommon and the car has plenty of passing power. Great car, highly recommended.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have 6000 miles on the car, which has developed many rattles and annoying clicks. I have been back to the dealer three times, and if one click or rattle is fixed, others appear. Very disappointing for Toyota. I have owned Toyotas my last six cars and was excited by the hybrid. The engine is smooth, but the car is a crate as far as body construction. Nearly everyone has a rattle in the console, the drink holder make noise if you have a drink in it.

<TEXT>The Camry rides so smooth. On a long trip it is great! There is hardly any inside noise. I love the handsfree phone system. The seats have more support and adjust very easily. The gas mileage is great too!! I am getting over 35 mpg and that is mostly highway driving. You can't tell when the engine starts while driving. No jerks or power jumps. The gauges are easy to see and the monitoring system is wonderful. I do like my music and the Camry has an 8 speaker and 6 disc system. I would recommend for any generation to get one of these.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Has as much or more power than any prev. vehicle I've owned. Very quick take offs when needed! Really performs well. Hugs the curves. Has a smooth ride, almost like gliding, especially in electric mode. First couple tanks of gas, we got just over 36 MPG, but that has consistently gotten better. The stereo is out of this world!! I think it comes standard. This car has been mistaken for higher end cars, one thought it was a Lexus, another thought it was a Mercedes. People always overestimate the price of the car. Overall, I LOVE THIS CAR!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The beauty of the car. It gleems. I'm usually not into aesthetics, but response to this car is amazing. They love the Jasper Pearl color & the shape of the car is smooth.

<TEXT>The TCH has delivered. It took some getting use to, since I previously owned a VW Phaeton with every feature and a 335 HP engine. Thus far, I have been pleasantly surprised by the way it handles in the rain. I had to 'adjust' my driving style to maximize the MPG capability. I have averaged 40+ MPG overall since obtaining the vehicle. It looks like during the cold months, 37-38 MPG. I have a rattle in the dash currently... nuts! One of the things I like best is the TCH looks like other Camrys. If you want to stand out for whatever reason, this car is not for you. If you want to save money, help the environment and reduce dependence on foreign oil, I would suggest consideration of the TCH!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My favorite features are Bluetooth, XM & GPS. All of these features are helpful while traveling on business (pleasure for that matter). I also like that the car gives 'instant' feedback on your driving through a variety of gauges and information. Keyless entry in the rain or with pkg's... super!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great midsize hybrid. I test drove the Accord and the Camry and the Camry seats much nicer and looks better too. It rides well, handles easily, comfortable inside (my father in law is 6'3" and sits well). It took some practice to learn to drive it optimally, but I do get an average of 41 mpg on the freeway at 70 mph. If the traffic is bad, I get up to 55 mpg in bumper-to-bumper traffic! I drive it 40 miles a day on the freeway and is definitely worth the money. If you want a comfortable midsize hybrid, this is definitely worth a test drive. I would buy it again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>What a fantastic car! We?ve had it for about 2 months now and are really impressed with the quality and the technology built into this vehicle. It drives soooooooo smooth and is so quiet. Is it because of the CVT? Possibly. It makes you want to drive more. Terrific mpg which is competitive to that of the smallest conventional engine Toyota cars (I think only Yaris has a comparable mpg with the Camry Hybrid). True, mpg not as good as the Prius?s but the Camry is a much heavier and better car, IMO. We bought for it safety (7 airbags plus all the other safety features you can find) and comfort but we also end up saving gas and helping the environment! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchase this vehicle in July of this year. When I first drove this car it felt really big, I have since gotten use to the feel of the car, I realize that it's not as big as I first thought, I also had to get use to the slow take take off from the traffic light, but after driving this vehicle you get use to this and you drive accordingly, also I get very good mileage per gallon, also I like the fact that the car is keyless all in all I like my car it drives excellent it does have speed too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>One of my favorite features is how big it is on the inside, also if I need to get something in or out of the trunk if I'm outside of the car as long as the monitor is on my person all I have to do is lift the trunk and it opens. Keyless is the way to go.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this car for two months, and it's great. I've found a few tricks to getting better gas milage. I noticed it only after getting better gass milage during the initial breakin period where I tried to vary my speed. After playing around and changing driving styles, I figured out the secret. With the car warmed up, when you reach cruising speed, take your foot off the accelerator completely, and slowly return it to the point where the car maintains speed. At under 42 MPH on level surface (or downhill) the TCH will completly switch to batteries, and on the highway it seems to put the car into an "econo" mode. I get over 45 MPG highway with this trick.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car for a week/480 miles and love it! Very sharp exterior appearance in silver, interior is comfortable and spacious (leather and moonroof added by dealership). I traded in a V6 Hyundai Tiberon and was concerned about responsiveness and pickup, this car does not disappoint! I commute 60 miles/day and am thrilled with my fuel economy...I'm getting 40+mpg every trip (and the "Excellent!" message, which is fun). There is a pulsing (I think "surging" may be too strong a word) at higher speeds as the computer combines the two power sources, but none of my passengers have noticed it and it's the nature of the technology at this time. I love this car, and highly recommend it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Lots of fun features even on base model. Fuel economy, "stealth mode," and head-turning looks.

<TEXT>A very impressive auto. Have driven over a week, 550 miles on one tank, 36-37 MPG, mostly highway. All the fuel saving feedback really has an effect on how you drive, which is a positive for me--I was something of a leadfoot. Leather seats are quite comfortable. Plenty of room, even with sunroof, for tall driver. Quiet on freeway, and particularly at lower speeds; it starts nearly silently. Good sound system adjusts to what road noise there is. Just as much pickup as my 2000 Accord SE 4 cyl.; no problem keeping up on highway. Bluetooth is cool; so is nav, but still learning how to use it. Really a technologically impressive vehicle for $30K. At least as cool as my relative's Lexus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I initially was disappointed with the mileage at 29 mpg in the city. I took a 500 mi highway trip and averaged 44 mpg. I am currently getting 32mph, and I baby the car (slow takeoffs, gliding, etc.) I anticipate the mileage will drop to the basic Camry mpg when I am using the heater in the winter, and the car doesn't shut off at stops. I suspect the car performs better in warmer areas than cold. The navigation has been adequate, but, gives different routes than my Garmin Nuvi. Bluetooth works well. The sound system is adaquate, but, not exceptional. The trunk is small, but functional. The slope of the window allows for excess condensation and lots of water wiping. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned a TCH for over three months, the mileage has been around 42 MPG on every tank since 2500 miles. It must have some brake in parts that take time to jell. It now runs on pure electric at 40 MPH on the flat and indicates over 60 MPG at 80 MPH on the flat. Great car and with the miles we put on it, the pay back will be quicker than the six years I estimated. The ride is not equal to the Volvos that we own, but the design is very quiet at speed. I'll keep mine until fuel cells are up and running.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an incredibly comfortable, quiet, and well thought-out car. Am averaging a little over 40 mpg, driving 60 - 80 mph on the highway about 70% of the time, with 20 to 40 mph city driving about 15% of the time, and stop and go big city traffic the remainder of the time. I find myself becoming increasingly obsessed with watching my driving habits, but still drive this like a normal car - I haven't become a complete hybrid geek... yet. With the tax credit (currently being phased out), the cost compares very well to similarly equipped gas Camry. Handling is good for this type of car, and exceeds expectations for a Camry (earlier Camry handling too soft for my liking). Try it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After months of automotive reviews and test drives, my wife and I finally decided on the 2007 Toyota Camry Hybrid and I have to say we are thrilled. This is a wonderfully designed and built machine. The ride is smooth and quiet and incredibly luxurious. My wife has a 2007 Lexus RX 350 and she kids me that she wants to trade vehicles because of the quality of the Camry Hybrid. The engine has plenty of "get up and go" and my fuel efficiency has been unbelievable. Toyota has made believers out of us. If you are seriously considering a hybrid, I would recommend this vehicle. Get yours before the IRS tax credit is reduced due to high volume of units sold. Enjoy!</TEXT>

The tire pressure gauge system really works. One of my tires lost four pounds and the light on the dash came on, checked the tires and sure enought one tire was leaking so it was caught before it went flat. The keyless entry system is great, just push a button. Has controllable rear air for the back seat passengers. Car is the most quiet car I have ever owned.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I have both been very impressed with the Camry Hybrid. It drives very smoothly, the car feels very solid, and we do not feel cramped at all (I'm 6'3", and she's 5'10"). Tons of leg room. Plenty of features - we were considering going for more options, but the base car is quite loaded and feels futuristic. Mileage has been excellent, but not quite the 40/38 advertised. We've enjoyed driving it so much that we each want to drive it, and we think of reasons to go out in it. We speed less in it, as we enjoy our time inside and don't want to waste gas. This is an impressive car with a great design and sharp looks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I must first say, this review is coming from a person who has always owned sports cars and doesn't consider herself the typical 'camry driver'. I have to say, that after doing some research on my camry hybrid and reading reviews stating that it lacked power, and the interior was cheap. I was somewhat nervous about my purchase. But, I have found that not only is it the most comfortable car I've ever owned, but the power is far above what I expected. It took me a few weeks to get used to the ICE shutting off, but since then, I haven't looked back. My only warning would be: If you need your speed to drive recklessly look elsewhere. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Over the years I have owned and driven over 35 cars, the first of which was a 1950 Packard, five of which were Toyotas. Now I own a Camry Hybrid. This vehicle is very exciting to drive and anyone that has ridden in it with me cannot belive the technology that goes into these vehicles. I have never been let down by any Toyota that I have owned. I am confident that this TCH will give me many years of inexpensive happy motoring.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, maybe not in heaven but very close. Averaging 36 mpg mixed city, highway with 1500 on the odometer. The a/c is a blast and so are the cvt transmission, audio system, brakes, steering, and everything about the car. Wow factor - was just stopped pulling out of a parking lot by a couple. They were wondering why they did not hear any engine noise. When they realized the Camry was a hybrid they wanted to know all about the car & couldn?t get over its looks. Frankly, after 2 months, neither can I. Seat comfort, layout, headroom all are tops. Frankly, you really have to scrape the barrel to even find something you can?t give a 10 to. Toyota has a keeper. Oh, the $2600 tax credit ain't bad either.</TEXT>

<TEXT>They hybrid engine takes a little getting used to. It's now two weeks after I started driving it, and I find I am getting over 40 mpg in mixed city and highway driving. I traded in a 2004 Camry for the Hybrid and the improvements were quite noticable. This is a comfortable, sprited well engineered vehicle. A family car that is great to drive. The gas savings put this car over the edge as far as being the right choice for the family sedan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Fuel econonmy on the highway has been better than EPA predictions, while results around town have been lower. The primary reason for the lower fuel economy around town is I drive up and down quite a few long and steep hills (>6% grade). In terms of comfort and general functions, the car has excxeeded my expectations. I'm still learning all the navigation and voice recognition features, although, I'm not sure how useful this stuff is.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The poor mileage is biggest problem (34). Not significantly better than gas camry V6. Lack of trunk space is very close second biggest problem. No, on second thought, it's a tie for first. NO TRUNK SPACE. Minor problem: very poor AM Radio reception. Much worse than other Toyotas I've owned.

<TEXT>I have had an excellent experience. I have been averaging around 35 MPG combined city/highway driving. In contrast to what is reported, my best mileage is coming from open highway driving vs bumper to bumper city traffic. I recently took it on a 500 mile trip of open highway driving and averaged 38 MPG. In the city when it is in electric only mode, I average about 35 mpg. This is probably because the electric motor is too weak to drive the vehicle unless the grade is completely flat or downhill.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I gave up my IS 300 which was only getting 24 mpg and required super unleaded gas for the TCH which has averaged +/-40 mpg and takes regular gas. That and the fact this is more of a family car makes the daily 90 mile commute (Playa del Rey to Irvine) somewhat bearable. I went with the base model in magnetic grey because no dealer (went to 4 and contacted 10) had the set up I wanted (grey & leather). No complaints so far. Only quirk I noticed was the low gas light came on and the cruise range stated 29 miles, but when I filled the tank, it only took 14.5 gallons. I guess the car is very conservative about running out of gas. Probably could've waited another 100 miles.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, I'm very happy with 07 camry hybrid. It makes average 36-39 mpg with mixed driving (65% city, 35% hwy), which gives me around 550 miles per gas tank (usually 13 gallons). Performance is sufficient for normal commuting but don't expect v6 performance (even with claiming 192 hp). I had my old 96 avalon V6 which accelerated faster but only made 19-22 mpg.

The Tilt/Telescopic wheel really makes it comfortable for me as the wheel adjusts over my knees!! The new TCH looks great too! I've owned it for 2 weeks and am getting 44-47 mpg combined mileage.

Traded in my '05 Camry LE for the '07, Barcelona Red w/Moonroof option - delivered w/11 miles direct from the factory. 5 weeks waiting time arrived 2 weeks early! 3 weeks of ownership & this car drives better than advertised & has exceeded all my expectations. Smooth handling, terrific steering, quiet, comfortable interior, great sound system, keyless electric start, good visual displays, great new eye-catching exterior design & best of all, it's fun to drive. My advice... if you can afford the added cost of the Hybrid over the regular model, run to your dealer & order one... NOW. You won't be disappointed!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After owning a '02 Prius for 3yrs. What a kick in the pants. I loved my Prius and the awesome performance but had to upgrade to the Camry (my 3rd). This car only has 6 options all else are standard features. We got the windows tinted and put 18" BBS rims on (not standard options). Talk about a grand driving experience. Only wish that Toyota would include the memory seats. Looks like I might have to get one for the wife also so I can fix that. For anyone debating about the Hybrid technology don't worry Toyota is cutting edge and about 10 yrs ahead of the competition in that case.

<TEXT>I had reservations about buying a hybrid. I was concerned the engine wouldn't have the pick-up-and-go power when I needed it. I took the Camry Hybrid for a test drive, and I was pleasantly surprised. The ride is smooth and quiet, but when I stomped on the gas, it really picked up a moved! I'm a little spoiled and I like creature comforts. I love the leather seats and as the temperatures have been in the mid-30s in the mornings lately, I like having the seat warmers. I like having the auxiliary jack to plug in my iPod. My one complaint is that they didn't offer seat memory.

Happy with our purchase though the interior is not up to typical Toyota standards. Car has been spot on reliable. No rattles or squeaks or bumper issues.

Between the adjustment and accommodating to the car's slower take off response it is a little tricky learning to move out into traffic from a side road. I am beginning to catch on and adjust. The car is responsive, but who wants to full throttle a hybrid when you are not in a pinch? It has a smooth quiet ride, sometimes eerily quiet. It took me a while to figure out how to dim the night light level on the instrument panel. There is a lot of light around the CD player.

<TEXT>My 07 Camry was delivered with every option for MSRP (dealer installed XM @ + $449). With a little effort most should get close to the EPA milage 41/38 per gal. This car replaces my 328i BMW and is equal in quality of workmanship and most features. Next week I'll test AZ mtn roads and uphill driving performance. The seating is very comfortable and ride quite. The synergy drive is smooth and many gauges are available to monitor energy useage. For those who just want to fit into the crowd this car doesn't scream HYBRID, like the Prius. The Navi-system is better than the Avolon and other 2006 Toyota models, many neat features. take delivery before 9/30/06 get Federal Tax credit of $2600.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It is fun to drive it is fully loaded, but with everything, it is kind of distracting. Learning how to drive it so you get all the gas mileage you can is really the only challenge so far. I have a heavy foot with a lot of sudden stops so it takes practice for me, but it is comfortable and fun to drive. The only draw back is the trunk with the batteries it takes up a lot of room. It has wonderful power and it is very smooth driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I have been driving a 2002 Camry 4cyclinder XLE and love it dearly. Never a moments trouble with this auto and fairly descent fuel efficiency.. avg 23mpg. Last month we purchased a 2007 Camry hybrid EXPECTING that this Toyota would be as elegant and fun to drive as the 2002!! The interior of the 2007 is not as nicely appointed as our former Camry and the overall driving experience is inferior to our 2002. The shifting process from gas engine to the electric motor drive is far from seamless and the average fuel consumption is only about 29mpg. We are both quite disappointed with our new Camry. The limited trunk space is also a major concern to us.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Pros: Still has plenty of power for a 4 cylinder and scoots up to 80 in no time. The GPS is a must!!! Comfort is respectable. (Apply leather conditioner to soften up the feel of sand paper for leather.) Very spacious and as a package (Hybrid) comes with many perks. The smart key is awesome but takes a couple days to get use to. Plenty of small storage places. Cons: Only expect an avg of 34 MPG. Big disappointment!! On the highway at 55 MPH with cruise control you will avg 44. But I travel a lot and cruise at 75 not 55. Also be aware that your trunk space is not what you expect. The batteries take up a lot of the trunk. The plastic in the car is okay except for the handles on the doors. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Upright driver's position and ample knee space make the '07 Camry the most comfortable car in its price range. My May 10 Test drive of the first hybrid in the area was a solid, quiet experience. Almost a month after taking delivery, I'm still doing demos for my friends. Consistently matching the sticker mileage ratings has encouraged me to improve my driving skills. In normal driving, the synergy drive is so smooth that is does little to call attention to itself. If I remember to pay attention, I sense engine shut down at full stops. The 4 cylinder note can be heard on long uphills and the regenerative brakes have an inobtrusive, but distinctive sound. The motor's torque is powerful!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a 1997 Ford Explorer- lovely gas mileage of 12 miles per gallon! Funny -- I drive 25 mi one way to work. Getting expensive to work these days. So,I went to test drive a camery xle when the hybrid (which I undersood wasn't even out yet) was on the lot. It is everything I wanted, gps, moonroof, heated seats and excellent gas mileage (rated at 40 / 38). The car was a delight to drive -- the price is about the same as a totally decked out xle. Except you have the tax incentive and the gas savings. The math and decision was easy. I absolutely love the car!! I average 38 miles per gallon. This includes mountain, air conditioning, freeway and city road driving. </TEXT>

I was not expecting to be excited about this car, I bought it to try to do my part for the environment/oil shortage. I am now excited. It's handling is exceptional, the mileage is better than advertised, it is well made and quiet. We traveled over 600 miles on our first 14 gallon tank of gas, and I am told the mileage will get better.

I really like the Nav screen and the "Consumption" display, I find myself paying too much attention to the MPGs. There is a small lag in power when you first try to get up to speed. In my opinion this is cause by the CVT. I would like to see a little more power, like the Highlander Hybrid has. Overall, I am very pleased with the car. I don't think I'm going to average 40 MPG, but I will come close and I'll do it in style.</TEXT>

I'm pleased with the quality of the fit and finish. I traded "down" from an Infiniti and I'm not disappointed. No it does not have a Lexus interior, but remember this car starts life as a $20,000 base model. Options help make it more comfortable, but it is not and should not be considered a luxury vehicle. With that said, I have no problem living with this car even if it seems like less than what I'm used to. I didn't buy this car to save money, I bought it to save gas. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The new Camry Hybrid offers a great deal of wonderful acessories including the ability to extend your MPG with its new Synergy drive. The car has plenty of power to get up to highway speed. However, once you reach 70MPH the car has a tendancy to lunge forward searching for a comfortable speed. The steering is dicy at these speeds which is also quite disconcerting. The interior materials look and feel cheap. Too much plastic! Even with the upgraded leather it is hard to believe that this car costs over $30,000. Toyota needs to get real when if comes to their pricing. The batteries form a wall between the trunk and the fold down rear seats which makes it impractical to load long objects. </TEXT>

Of course one of the main reasons I bought it was that it is a hybrid. A little over a year ago my wife and I passed a gas station sign (in our conventional Toyotas at the time) and the price of gas had headed well over $3.00 and we looked at each other and decided to look at hybrids. I ended up buying the Camry hybrid and she bought a Prius. Boy are we glad that we bought the cars with gas hovering around $4.00/gallon now!! We plan to keep the cars for as long as possible and we believe that in the end it will save us money.</TEXT>

Since then the actual mileage on the 2008 and 2009 models is more realistic. Just had to replace 4 tires at 19,000 miles, after being serviced at the dealership regularly. This was another disappointment. The car runs well, but purchased it because of the anticipated mileage. The government credit did not turn out to be the full $2,600.

<TEXT>I loved my Ford 5.4 SuperCrew truck, and was worried about the transition, but I have no regrets. Bought when gas was a low point, so that was in my favor. The Camry has all the extra features of a 'normal' car. I like the way it gives you all the tools to track mileage and optimize your driving habits for the best gas mileage (I have the nav console). Performance is just fine; not a rocket, but certainly not a dog, either. My mileage is generally 36 combined, w/ my best being a bit over 39 on a long highway trip, which conflicts w/ the better city that gets advertised. Only issue, to date, is a rattle around the sunroof. The trunk is adequate, albeit a bit small.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Since purchasing our Camry Hybrid back in November 2006, we have had absolutely no problems of any kind with this vehicle. The Camry rides and drives just as well if not better than many other luxury vehicles, but with much better fuel economy. The only strike against the Camry Hybrid would be the loss of trunk space due to battery storage, but overall this is a great vehicle if you are looking for good fuel economy and a fun car to drive. I would highly reccomend this vehicle to anyone that still wants the luxury car ride and ammenities, but still gives you good fuel economy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Overall ride and handling is great. Instrumentation is also very good, vehicle lets you know anything and everything that is going on with this vehicle from a tire that is low on air to even letting you know if you are getting the maximum fuel economy by displaying excellent on dash.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the 50th Anniversary Edition. Overall I like it (now 2.5K miles). Traded BMW X5 SAV 3.0i; wanted to drive green. Averaging 29-32 in town, depending on how hard I accelerate; 36-42 on freeway. It does promote one to drive better. Disappointed in lack of Toyota quality - rattle in dash; ill-fitting door bits. Now dealerships (all in my area) have no moldings or spoilers available for after market, because of Anniversary Edition. Very annoying.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is quiet, comfortable and great for the environment. It ha lots of great options, features that integrate well together. The Bluetooth and the nav system work very well together. The biggest problem is that most of the operations of the nav system and the phone are disabled when moving. This means that a user has to pull over, sometimes into a dangerous place, in order to operate these features. Older versions allowed for an override, but the current version does not. It should be the consumer's choice to operate while driving, or to pull over, whichever is the safer option.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After my wife driving an Explorer for 4 years she was ready for a change. Wanted a Hybrid due to her job going back and forth to patient's homes in the city. Went to drive a Prius but saw the white 50th anniversary edition Camry on the dealership floor. She is very happy with the car and I am happy to drive it as well though I consider myself a car enthusiast. Mileage has ranged from 28 in the city on 95 degree days with the A/C cranking to almost 40 on the highway without the A/C. The ride is a little bouncy due to the extra battery weight and the brakes are a little touchy but nothing annoying. The CVT is a little droning when accelerating. Overall we really like the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Replaced a 2002 Acura TL Type S, went from fast driving to a more relaxed pace. Hybrid has made this transition easy. While responsiveness and acceleration is less, overall performance is on par. I drive a little slower, don't take the passing lane as often, but end up arriving in the same amount of time, but feeling more relaxed and having used way less gas. I still routinely hit 80 MPH, but try to keep it lower, while averaging about 38-39 MPG. Interior is comfortable and very quiet. Handling is a little soft, but adequate. No major complaints: steering wheel is too narrow and hard to grip for long periods, rear visibility is difficult, brake pedal angle is to high. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned my Camry Hybrid for 15 months. It is without a doubt the best car I have ever owned. It is so quiet, handles great, roomy passenger space and not a single complaint. I have made 3 trips from Corvallis, OR to Bozeman, MT averaging 39-41 mpg, which includes drives thru mountain passes and typical speeds of 75 mph, 3 people in the car and loaded with baggage. In my first year, I have saved $800 in gas compared to my previous car (1997 Volvo wagon) in just the first year. Overall, I am getting about 37.5 mpg. In winter weather, the mileage drops within the city to about 34-35 mpg. The Camry Hybrid has plenty of power and acceleration. I easily pass cars going up steep hills.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I usually burn less than 6l/100km, sometimes as little as 5.2l/100km on a weekend trip. Excellent fuel economy. It is not slow, it has plenty of acceleration. The ride is very smooth but I would prefer it be firmer to improve steering responsiveness. The fact there are no gear changes adds to the smoothness of the ride. Moving off when the light turns green is not noticeably different than other cars with an automatic transmission, even if the engine was not running during the red light. Plenty of room, comfortable for four adults, no bad seats in the house. In the first year of use, I have had no problems to report except my wife could let me drive it more often.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This car is so quiet it spoils you for anything else, all luxury cars should go hybrid! The keyless system is easy to get used to, very natural in operation. It saves gas, but without having to make any compromise other than the purchase price - which I thought was reasonable for what you get.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Now nearly a whole model year old, this TCH is still our favorite. Gas mileage is almost too good - mixed city/highway driving yields high 30s to very low 40s. If you set the cruise control for 60 mph on the highway, expect to be rewarded with 42-43 mpg. (OK, you will get passed a lot.) The car has comfort, well laid out dash and controls. It fits us in all respects except for the arm rests. Our experience suggests buyers duck the GPS option. We found a good after market GPS superior as it is both more accurate and easily moved between family cars. While we appreciate the performance, it does get on to the interstate system easily, but the TCH is no "muscle car" either.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just retired and wanted a full size car with excellent mileage. Camry hybrid is the definitive. Chose the 50th anniversary edition because we wanted something unique. It also had all the features we were looking for such as GPS, leather ans extra sound reduction. 1st 1,000 miles MPG averaged 34 MPG... 33 in town and 39 highway. 35 MPG overall is very reasonable. There are several features available to help you learn to maximise MPG and I find the consumption screen most helpful. Using this screen you quickly visualize your driving habits and what is needed for MPG improvement. We have had many prople stop us in parking lots to ask about the hybrid features and comment on the car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>35+ MPG on a full size car. Every luxury you can imagine at a reasonable price.

<TEXT>I'm getting 40 mpg ave. on freeway and street driving. You have to use common sense too to save gas. If you're going downhill try to keep your foot off the gas pedal. Uphill, try if you can to use cruise control to 65-70mph and let the onboard computer regulate the gas - this will recharge the battery greatly. Cruise control is not recommended for those with poor reflex.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the car for commuting about 120 miles per day. The car has performed flawlessly. It has consistently gotten about 37 MPG driving at 70 to 80 MPH up down a mountain pass (climb is about 2500 feet). The car has surprising power (passing on the mountain uphills is no problem). The car is fun to drive and handles well. And, it constantly reminds you to conserve in driving by having an "MPG" gauge instead of an RPM gauge and by having the dash board display a deeper blue the better you are with gas. If you want a car that is comfortable and fun, gives great gas mileage, has room for more than one person, has plenty of power, chose this one.</TEXT>

After struggling with the owner's manual for the first week (running out to the garage at 1 am to try a new found gadget), my wife and I now use every gadget in the auto. Our gas mileage has been less around town than advertised, however, on a trip, with the cruise, we average 42. I drive as I always do and have not changed my habits to get a few more m/p/g. We are having a slight problem with the bluetooth, however, I don't know if it is my phone or the car system. This car is a dream to drive and own.

<TEXT>Be assured that the Camry Hybrid is simple to operate, don't worry about getting used to it. Once you own one of these (or the Prius), you will not want to go back to a non-hybrid. They use twice the fuel and are not going to have the resale of a hybrid. I love the door opener and combined with the starter button, what could be better? Recently, I had to rent a car and the only one that was available was a Chevrolet. It's an OK car, but I am glad the trip is over, so I can get back behind the wheel of my Camry Hybrid. At times, I rent cars for long trips so I don't pile up so many miles on my Camry. Long story short, get a demo, buy one, start saving gas money!!</TEXT>

With just over 500 miles on the car we are consistantly getting over 35 MPG and have recorded 41 on several short trips in and around town. The quality of the build is amazing in that the fit and finish is exact. There is a slight hesitation when starting out, but you quickly disregard it after awhile. The engine response is very good when the electric motor kicks in. The new Camry is a big car and there is plenty of HP to do the job.

<TEXT>We purchased the Camry hybrid in hopes of saving lots of money at the pump. We have done that and then some with the rising of gas prices. The features (Bluetooth, navigation, instrumentation, etc) are far beyond what we are used to in a car. The car has held to between 36-38 mpg in the San Antonio area. We do a lot of stop and go and some highway for 10-50 miles at a time. It is neat to watch your progress on the huge screen the camry provides in dash. I only wish the Bluetooth was a little better as far as picking up your voice. You have to be very quiet to have a normal conversation but it does the job. We also received the $2600 tax credit for being one of the first to purchase. </TEXT>

I have a very heavy foot on interstate - still getting 37+ on the highway and steady 35+ in town. I do not drive any differently than previous car. I suspect that mileage would be greater with a little finesse. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Big car feel but definitely small car economy. Navigation system is superb. I like the integrated XM radio. Vehicle is extremely quiet except on hard acceleration. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Will have had the Camry for one year in a few weeks. The car is great. The only problem was the same as a year ago and that is the size of the trunk. Hope this will be improved upon. Also the nav system is WAY to hard to work.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>40 mpg, heated seats, great seats, push start, great ride and overall comfort.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Wife was tired of the gas guzzling GMC Envoy so we read up on the hybrids and concluded the Camry the best choice after the test drive. The options and extras are what you would find in a Lexus, really nice! Quiet, classy, comfortable ride, and the most FUN I've had driving a car in a long time. The wife loved it so much, she wouldn't let me drive it, so I went out and bought me one. Traded in my 2001 Montana minivan and am having a blast with it. I am 6'2, 340 plus and have more than enough room to enjoy the ride. The best road mileage I have gotten is 52.7 mpg going 60 mph (no a/c). Best in the city was 44.3 mpg. It constantly beats the sticker ratings of 40/38 all the time!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car has exceeded all expectations. I drive to maximize mileage, live in upstate NY where I am getting about 33 during the winter, 40 during the spring and fall and 36 in the summer. Because of the battery, truck is limited but fine for us. Absolutely amazing vehicle. Can run on battery at 40 mph and under and will almost always take advantage of electric when necessary.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really can't say enough about how much I enjoy driving this car. The ride is smoother and quieter than my Lexus. I can't speak more highly of any car that I have ever had or rode in. I started out not caring if we got a hybrid or a 6 cylinder but we found just what we wanted in the hybrid so we bought it. After having driven it almost 800 miles I just love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>GREAT gas mileage, roomy interior, navigation, handles like a dream.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It's been almost 2 months since I've owned the Camry Hybrid. I've been getting an average of 37 mpg after 4 fill-ups. This car has all the features and technology that you can find only in luxury cars like Lexus and Acura. I've changed my driving style since I started driving it. I no longer put the pedal to the metal on green lights, I drive at the speed limit and I try to use electric only whenever possible. Also, I started to laugh at the big fat SUVs and how much gas they're wasting as the speed past me. :) </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quietness of the car. Technology such as bluetooth, navigation, hybrid, fuel economy, design.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love this car! I've only had it for about 10 days but look forward to driving it every day. I love construction zones now! Can set the cruise control at about 27 mph and run on nothing but the electric engine, (sorry everyone behind me). I love shutting it off after driving and getting the "Excellent" rating. I'm still trying to figure out the optimal mpg way to drive it and having lots of fun. It's nice to be able to wait in front of my kids' school for 15 minutes for them to get out and be able to run the a/c in 90 degree temp. and not use any gas or emit any polution. This is a great family car, safe, reliable, great mpg, and low emissions. This is my 2nd Camry, first was 2002.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The CVT, so smooth. On screen engine usage (gas or elec). Smart key, rear a/c ducts, all the standard features are great. JBL stereo, bluetooth, steering wheel controls, Toyota reliability. This is the only car I've bought that I actually read the manual! Actually enjoyed reading it too!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have never been a toyota fan, but this car is very impressive. The hybrid drivetrain is amazing, and this car is pretty much loaded with everything except wood trim. The mileage is superb (~37mpg overall). The new body style is cool.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fuel economy, high quality leather, technology is awesome. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We had to wait 4 months before picking up the car and learned after filing our taxes that we were not entitled to the whole $2600 tax refund as we had anticipated. But we are exceedingly satisfied with the car. We are getting 42-44 mpg on long trips going 65-70 mph. Very quiet on the road and no noise when starting to drive with electric engine operating.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very practical car and very modern technology inside as well as with drive train.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Through 11 months and 16,500 miles the Camry Hybrid couldn't have been better. Average mpg is 35.2 with 40 plus mpg at sustained highway speeds (65-70). The performance is more than adequate for hill climbing, two-lane road passing even on hills, and merging onto freeways. The electric motor seems to work like a supercharger. I am very pleased. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It feels as though you're driving in a cloud. The kids fall asleep in it instantly even though the powerful stereo system may wake them. It's a very quite car. You do not hear any noises coming from the engine and for me that is a plus. You get over 600 miles to the tank full and it only needs 17.4 gallons to fill up approx. I love my Camry. First time owner and will continue buying Toyota from now on. It's like buying gold. Try it out I think you won't regret it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I enjoy the comfort and the smoothe interior design. The stereo system and the phone system is A+. Handsfree Bluetooth It works marvelously. My wife loves it too. It saves us a lot of money on gas and it's very comfortable. You need to drive one to feel the difference. </FAVORITE>
