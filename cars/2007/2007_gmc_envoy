<TEXT>Drastic improvements needed with cup holders - terrible wind noise - larger brake pedal - seat belt B pillar should be adjustable. Good power good audio difficult GPS system throw it out and start over. Use Mapqwest as a model. Nice interior fit and finish. Easy to drive and park. Inadequate sn visor size Use same as Tahoe. In general its a pretty good car with all the goodies but definitely NOT professional grade.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Air compressor - driveability - Reasonable gas mileage. Workmanship in build is great. (Thanks Canada)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the 6th SUV I have owned. The others were Fords. I hesitated buying the car because of some review I read but I liked the looks of it so I bought it anyway. I have been extremely happy with the car. It drives and rides well. I have the Denali so it has about everything on it. I wouldn't call it a workhorse but in the Oregon where I live it fits the needs of the typical small family. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I activated and use OnStar, XM radio and the built in cellular phone. These services have shown their value. I also like the 4 wheel drive selection that allows the car to decide when to engage 4 wheel drive. This is very useful in a rainy climate.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have to say, I went from a VW New Beetle to this beautiful GMC vehicle. I've only owned Chevy's in the past (excluding my short stint with the Bug), and I am so pleased that I purchased this SUV. No, the gas mileage isn't the greatest, but the satisfaction and pure enjoyment that I get out of driving everyday makes up for it. I hope to have this car well over the 100k mileage mark as I travel from duty station to duty station across the U.S. I am a proud owner of this GMC! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Safety, comfort, style, convenience, DVD player (for my daughter on long trips!), easy maneuvering, sound system and XM radio, and storage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We've had mostly fords,after 10 yrs with a 97 GMC Safari AWD & no issues we decided to look at GMC. Our 96 Lincoln continental 96 was nothing but trouble & poorly built so we didn't consider Ford. We tried the new Saturn Outlook and found it to be "too large" & the cost w/options too high. We test drove the Toyota Highlander & offroad Toyota as well as the Nissan SUV. The Toyota was souless & they wouldn't negotiate. The Nissan was ok but the interior was bland. We chose the Envoy Denali because we wanted the towing capability, durability of a truck and the better fuel mileage the Denali's 8 cylinder with 4 cylinder cutout offered. We average 18 in city and 22 hywy. 1 yr later we r 100% hapy</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great styling with 18" chrome wheels, fantastic Bowes Stereo w/ Sat stereo,heated seats, beautifully appointed interior, sunroof/moonroof, individual temp controls, 6500 lb towing ability, ultra smooth & powerful engine driveline with 3.42 axle ratio for low rpm cruise & best fuel economy</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this SUV because I was really drawn to the style and outside appearance of the vehicle I also fell in love with the interior. I have leased Nissan vehicles in the past and my husband talked me into looking at GMC. I thought it was everything I wanted in an SUV so we purchased the SUV instead of leasing. I travel on the highway 90% of the time and I was so disappointed in the wind noise of this vehicle I knew something had to be wrong. Why would you make such a classy vehicle and forget about quality. After taking it to the dealership three time we were told nothing is wrong with the vehicle that is just the quality of GMC. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the Envoy after driving my 99 GMC Jimmy nearly 200000 miles. After test driving competitor models, I returned to GMC for a vehicle with more features and more for my money. The Envoy has been flawless in performance. The mileage isn't the greatest but accelerating easy has me exceeding the estimated mpg. I am getting 16.5 mpg city and 22-23 highway. The Envoy has good visibility and drives off road reasonably well. I am still impressed by how comfortable the seats are. Storage and space is impressive. GMC just needs to add some of teh features of the Acadia and they will have the perfect mid size SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride is far better then any competitors comparable model. I also think the interior lay out and comfort are superior. Improved styling over earlier models such as steering wheel, gear shift, and seats. Ability to change options through display on instrument panel and steering wheel buttons.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just love this car. It's like driving a Cadillac on a GMC budget. Quiet, powerful and handles like a sports car. It stops on a dime, corners better than any SUV I've ever driven and sticks to the road like glue even on rain-slicked highways. With it's high body placement, I have no problem driving on construction sites and don't have to worry about driving through a heavily rocked area or up/down a dirt embankment. My last vehicle was a 2004 Buick Rainier. This is the same GM body but it is miles ahead of the Rainier in every catagory. If you want a truck with class and comfort, this is your ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Envoy Denali is a pleasure to drive because of it's luxury and performance. Build quality is outstanding and the option packages include the DVD and Nav systems. Even though the Envoy is going to be replaced by the Acadia, it's still a great vehicle at an affordable price. I love the creature features and the safety and security of the front and side air bags.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Denali interior is top notch with the leather heated memory seats to the Nav and DVD systems. The stability track and the ride leveling make the ride smooth and secure.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was very hesitant to purchase the Envoy because I was driving an extremely reliable 2007 Toyota FJ Cruiser at the time. The FJ Cruiser was a fun vehicle to own, but there were a lot of design flaws I could not get past. Most of all, the suicide doors made it very difficult for people to get in and out of the back seat. The Envoy provides such a quiet and comfortable ride. My wife and I carpool to work most of the week, and we look forward to our morning and afternoon drives in our Envoy. I am fairly sure that the next car I purchase will also be a General Motors vehicle. I encourage anyone that is shopping for a safe and comfortable SUV to test drive the Envoy. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Some great features include OnStar, dual-zone manual climate control, cruise control, etc.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought mine 1 year ago and now have 31000 miles on it. I have had all kinds of cars and one other SUV in the past 25 years ranging from Fords to Mercedes. The comfort is fantastic. The ride is solid, secure, sure,and quiet. You get behind the wheel and you feel safe, confident, and in command. It is not fun but I do not think it was meant to be. It is hardly a sports car. But, if you want something that is comfortable on the road for long stretches, solid, safe, roomy, powerful, versatile, this is it. Even my dog loves riding in the back (sometimes with one of his friends). I recently drove it from NY to NC and back with my fiancee and her son. The drive was so easy. I just love it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Envoy, my first was a 2002. It had massive engine problems at 2000 miles and after I totaled it from hitting a deer, I got a new one. I primarily got it for the high comfort great looks. It has little problems that make it spend days at the shop. It has also lost most of its value over the 5 months I've owned it. I would not buy another but I would rather buy an American car rather than some Honda or Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving a '98 Tahoe for 9 years, with its poor brakes, poor gas mileage, and sloppy handling, it has been a real pleasure to experience the performance of my 2007 Envoy Denali. The 5.3 litre V8 out performs the 5.7 in my 98 by far and the gas mileage is at least 30% better around town. I haven't found anything I don't like about the car. Well, just one, no glove box light.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased new the day after big snowstorm.The 4WD is awesome and unobtrusive - really gets the job done. Also took from Ohio to Florida and back, great road vehicle. Fuel economy didn't suffer despite speeds of, well, lets just say well north of 70 MPH during the entire trip. Tire pressure monitor system saved our bacon when we picked up a screw in a tire in GA. The alert allowed me to change the tire before it went down and destroyed itself. Really nice vehicle. This thing has awesome legroom. I'm 6" and can totally stretch out. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great power for an I-6. Decent stereo w/ XM. I have the Carbon Fiber styled interior - looks awesome. Very quiet and easy to drive. Corners great - better than the reviews say it does. Several little storage compartments in cargo area. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought it 03/23 I have about 2050 miles and they are excellent miles. This is a road machine, you set up in a commanding position, ride comfort and handling prowess are all superior, It has a very confident and agile feel to it while rolling down the highway, has 18? wheels and responses very well to rapid moves. The inline 6 cy 4.2 liter w\291hp is extremely responsive when you need it. The Envoy is a very quiet ride, wind and road noise are minimal. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power of the in line 6. The auto volume, auto dimmer mirror, the leather the faux wood trim with the brushed nickel finish, XM, OnStar, 6 disc Bose rocks. Hands free phone is a great feature. Tire pressure monitor. Handles great in turns</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was very impressed with the comfort and performance of the 2007 Envoy, so I bought it. It drives very smooth and my kids enjoy the ride in the back seat. Even on railroad tracks or on pot holes, you almost do not feel the bumps. I am impressed with the fuel economy even though it has a lot of power. Excellent air conditioning for the hot summers. Great vehicle for the price, you won't get a better deal.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I would highly recommend purchasing an Envoy Denali. I test drove a Toyota, Honda, and Nissan and were really dissapointed their quality of exterior styling, ride and handling, and est EPA. I love the 100,000 warranty, XM satellite radio and how quietly it drives with all that power!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I would absolutely recommend an Envoy. The guy on the next review who can't figure out the NAV should take a second and read the owners manual. My 8 year old read the manual and figured out the NAV in 10 minutes. I have not had one problem with my Envoy. The quality is outstanding and it drives excellent. Compared to the Toyota, my Envoy is affordable, looks great, and I feel very safe driving it. GMC gives me a 100,000 mile warranty, and sends someone to fix my flat tire, for free! Now that's professional grade.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Compared Rendezvous, Buick's new Acadia, and TrailBlazer. I was looking for smooth ride, and a vehicle that felt like if I step on the gas I wasn't taxing the vehicle. \As soon as I test drove this I said "this is it!" Traded a 2005 Nissan Pathfinder LE with 30000 miles, don't miss it at all! Tried some foreign models, never felt like I had a solid car. You must try this vehicle if you are looking for a SUV. Not too big, not too small. My husband liked it so much, he traded his 2006 Ford for a new GM Sierra. We will keep these for a long time. Both have the solid feel 40 somethings are looking for. Paid about the same as low and mid end foreign vehicles. Got better ride and quality.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine, and the ride. Gas mileage is better than 6 cylinder Nissan. Every option is easily accessible to the driver. Seats are very comfortable and versatile. Ease of parking and taking off. Headlight washers, love them! Unobstructed view. Memory seats make getting in and out very natural. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I absolutely love driving this vehicle. That V8 w/302 horses under the hood ensures your entry onto the highway is a seamless transition. The ride is extremely comfortable and quiet. It rides just as smooth as my 2006 Lexus GS300 AWD! This is a well built vehicle with nice amenities. The Nav system does eliminate the 6 disc CD, however, I never listen to CDs in the car. I listen to my XM satellite radio. My wife and I test drove all the competitor's product and decided to purchase the Denali. What a great decision! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I really enjoy this vehicle. I personally like the nav system and don't really care about the whole "CD" issue. Oh by the way, I also own an '06 Lexus GS300 AWD and my wife owns an '06 RX330 and neither one of us listens to CDs. We do however enjoy our subscriptions to XM satellite radio. I test all the competitors products and found that the Denali was equivalent to the 4Runner, Pathfinder and the other American products as well. I love driving this vehicle. I drove it from Herndon, VA to Knoxville, TN and it performed extremely well and was a very comfortable ride. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We love several features. OnStar services to include the personal phone number for the vehicle, V8 engine with 300 plus horses, rear seat option to attach headphones and listen different radio stations than the driver, memory functions, truck space and the stability of the ride in curves. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Envoy Denali is far better than the Toyota Highlander and Honda Pilot that I drove for years. The Highlander and Pilot are so ugly, and the quality was questionable.. I thought Toyota and Honda were supposed to have good quality? The Envoy Denali has superior performance. The wood trim looks far more premium and the chrome looks fantastic! I will never go back to a Japanese vehicle again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>You hear all the hype about GMC being "Professional Grade", don't believe it. I purchased an '07 Envoy with a Nav System. This Nav system is a waste of money. It is DVD based like most, but the one thing that GMC did that all other makersdecided not to do was to only allow the in-dash unit to accept one disc at a time! For a $2000 option, don't waste your money if you want to Nav and listen to your CDs! Get the 6-disc in- dash and buy a TomTom or Garvin that rides on the dash. It is cheaper and better that way!</TEXT>
