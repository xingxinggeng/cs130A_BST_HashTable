<TEXT>Don't buy Altima with CVT if it does not have ABS. The issue occurs at speeds over 45 mph. If you slam breaks so they lockup until car comes to complete stop transmission locks up and throttle is stuck for up to a minute at a time. Nissan refused to correct this issue saying that this is intentional to protect transmission. It happened to me at intersection and I was able to duplicate this every time at will. I have traded my car and bought a new one. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Disappointed</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>The brakes in my 2007 Altima are horrible. I began hearing squeaking noises after 1500 miles. I went to the dealership 7 times with no resolution. Rotators and brake pads were replaced several times with still no resolution. It's awful that the EXPERT could not repair the braking system. I went thru arbitration and won, but they wanted me to pay them 1,600.00 to walk away from the car-are they crazy?? I could trade the car in with 0 out of pocket fees. I will never recommend Nissan to anyone. To have purchased a brand new car and then experience probs with the brakes so early on is ridiculous. Customer service was also rude and not helpful. Good riddance. Don't buy Nissan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the altima 3.5 sl loaded. I really like my altima but it has had a lot of problems. I am in arbitration right now for Nissan to buy it back because they want to switch out engine because they can't figure out what is wrong with it. It was stuttering and not running smooth. After 30+ days in shop, they recommended total engine replacement. Starting at 18k miles, I had headlight, sun visor go out. I had to have belt and tension pulley replaced, master cylinder replaced; emergency brake light was coming on. Brake wear out fast</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased this car used with 31,000 miles on it. Have had it for 3 months now and am really happy with the car. Great styling inside and out. Rides very smooth and no wind noise. I stand 6 foot and I am very comfortable in this car, my knees are not pressed into the dash. The only complaint I have is the stereo, the sound quality is awful. I assume it's the base stereo option. I'm thinking about upgrading the whole stereo system because of the sound quality.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2007 3.5 V6 CVT SL with 40K & I love it. This car was loaded w/lther, Bose, turn signals on the ext mirrors, b/u camera, Nav, XM Sat, 6 disc chngr, sunroof, bluetooth phone etc. I chose this over an 06 Acura TL. Yes, its true. I went shopping to replace my much loved 03 TL Type-S. I just could not rationalize spending 2K more & get less. This car has 270hp & rides smooooth. Its black on black. The Bose is fantastic. If you can buy an Altima that is loaded, you won't find a better value, how do they sell Maxima's next to this...? By the way I would not have bought the 4 cyl version, only 170 hp.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car brand new in 2007. I can't tell you how excited I was to get it. I had so much fun driving it and I got an endless amount of compliments about it. I don't think you get as many miles per gallon as they say you do, but it's still great on gas. The key never has to leave your pocket because there are buttons on the door, trunk, and a push start button to start the car. I got hit head on last weekend and my car is totaled. I can't tell you how miserable I am thinking about how much more I could have enjoyed my car. Just remember, for the 20 some thousand you are paying, don't expect the world, but expect so much more than you would from any other can in its class.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 2 months of searching and test driving, I ended up with an Altima SE. I drove; Camry, TL, G35x & Accord and by far the Altima was my favorite. It's sporty and has everything I wanted in a car. Please know it does drive somewhat like a sports car, so if you want a smooth ride go for the Accord or Camry. This car is the whole package, from the redesigned exterior to the dash and interior, I just really like the way it looks for a 4dr sedan. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had Acuras for 12 years and decided to go with the new Nissan as a change and in response to high fuel prices. Tried the Honda, Nissan, Toyota and choose the Altima because of overall package for price. Aside from the recalls which I had expected given the first model year of new model, I have had a number of issues that should not have happened and have lead me to believe it is not worth the price. To top it off, I do not believe Nissan places as high a value on dealer customer service. I would not recommend Nissan cars or their services and I am trying to get my money in order to unload this car that is just not good enough.</TEXT>

My rotors had to be turned already and don't get a remote starter to the tune of 549.00 for this really bad car. I'm trading this thing in next week. What's it gonna be like at 40000 miles??

<TEXT>Great car for the money. I bought it brand new and it is now 2 years old. Nissan did a wonderful job of picking nice features to include and leaving others out to provide a wannabe luxury car at an economy car price. This is a very comfortable car, and performs wonderfully on the highway. I have added a K&N filter and that has given me a few extra MPG. The mileage is not as good as advertised on the sticker, but is still exceptional. I get about 32ish on the highway and 26 in town. The car handled very well in the snow. The only maintenance I have done is change the oil and clean the air filter in these first 26000 miles and I have had no problems at all. Just a great car. Highly recomended</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sleek look. HEATED SEATS!!!!! (great for Rochester winters) CVT is great on gas mileage and provides a smooth ride. Plenty of pep for a 4 cylinder. Nice leather interior. Folding rear seats really help when hauling bulky items. Cupholders that WORK and are easy to clean. Excellent storage all over.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had many Honda Accords and a few Camrys. I traded my 2007 Accord EXL with navigation for my 2007 Altima 2.5SL and don't regret it. I never had a Nissan before, but was persuaded by a friend of mine who has had 3 Maximas with no problems. I have had the car for about a month now and have about 3200 miles on it. My gas mileage is great with a combination city/highway of 26.8 miles per gallon. My only issue was that the car drifts on the highway. I had the dealer look at it and they said that everything was okay. I asked if it could be the tires (Continental tires were installed at the factory). I replaced them with Michelin tires. I haven't had an issue since then.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, style, power, comfort, looks, XM radio and navigation. I bought a 2.5SL and they replaced the original stereo with an aftermarket Pioneer stereo with nav and XM at delivery. It looks like the factory Bose with nav and a lot less money.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In terms of looks, driving and performance for the 4-cylinder segment, this is a great car. Haven't been able to compare to the new 2008 Accord yet, which looks to be nice but not as sporty as the Altima. This car is very responsive in acceleration, braking and steering. Really fun to drive. Controls are all easy to reach and understand. Good selection of features/packages. Nice redesign in both exterior and interior. I have an S Conv package, with added leather, sunroof, fogs, spoiler, ABS, alum kickplates, splash guards and floor mats. Couldn't be happier.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT w/175 HP and 180 lbs/torque, and great mileage. Huge gas tank (20 gal) so less frequent fill-ups. Design, quality, driving characteristics, lights. Just about everything.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 3rd Altima SE since 2002 and I have to say this one beats my 02 and 04 altima SEs hands down. Its faster, more stylish, more comfortable, better on gas and you can see and feel the Infiniti side of Nissan in this car. Fuel mpg is about 22 city 28 highway (note I like to drive fast). I test drove a Mazda6 v6, Honda Accord v6, Toyota Camry v6 and some Ford and Chevy cars and I must say the Altima was the best all around car in its class. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Drove Toyota for 20 years. Seduced by sheet metal on '07 Camry, traded 2000 Avalon for 4-cyl. LE. Big mistake. We were not happy. Traded for 4-cyl. Altima w/SL pkg. You get SO much more car for the money with Nissan!! More power, seamless shifting, quicker handling, quieter, slightly better mpg, bluetooth, heated seats. Bose stereo is awesome, better leather and controls. For this model, Toyota loses in ALL categories!</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I test drove the 2.5L/4 I found the vehicle nimble and quick at low speeds but requiring some time to 'wind-up' at faster speeds in order to pass/merge. The 3.5L/6 on the other hand was like a rocket that I had to keep tied down. It was almost annoying driving in the city because the bloody car just wanted to blast off! It absolutely hated stop and go traffic and red lights! The 3.5L was a noticably heavier vehicle and had a lot of brake lurch. Again, the 3.5L hated stop and go traffic but on the highway it was a dream. Too bad the car drank so much gas! I opted for the 2.5L because of this plus the $6000 less in price. No seat issues.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was shopping for gas economy and yet did no want to drive a death trap or have low quality feel, Altima was it. Its been two days, I put on 269 miles & used not quite 1/2 tank of gas. I call it my 4 cylinder luxury car! While it's not a sports car it does handle well and has good power. I find the overall quality and feel to be top shelf. This is a great value and am sure the reliability will be as good as the other Nissans I've had. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bose, I like the way the presets can be fm, am or satellite radio without having to switch between them. The modern technology. The gas use meter, I've made a game out of keeping the meter in the higher gas saving side. It looks good too, I have teens and it meets they're approval! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was all set to buy the Passat (also a lot of car for the money) and decided last minute to drive the Nissans. Drove both the Maxima and Altima and it was clear as day that I preferred the Altima, much more fun to drive for me and newer technology throughout. Slightly less luxurious than Maxima though. So far, I love this car. Pure pleasure to drive and I hate when I arrive at work and have to get out of this thing. I think it is the right combination of size, comfort, sport and economy to win the category hands down. I can say this after having driven the Passat, Accord, Camry, A4 and countless others. My second choice would have been the Passat. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The V-6 is very strong, and the styling really turns heads. The stereo could have a little more output, but the sound quality is good. The intelligent key is very cool, but it does take some getting used too. Many in the Altima forums have complained about the gas mileage, but my first trip yielded 33 mpg with 90% highway driving. I picked the V-6 because much of my driving is in the mountains and it was actually a better deal than the I-4. I've gotten mixed comments concerning the premium fuel issue, but most who have the V-6 have run regular fuel without problems. In conclusion, I believe this is the best value on the market in a midsize sedan. Period.</TEXT>

<TEXT>All I have owned before were Hondas. My husband and I were ready for a change, and I am glad I made it. The day I picked it up it was 98 degrees outside, my 4 cyl Accord was a dog with the A/C on, took the Altima home with the A/C blasting and it never skipped a beat. Love the "no shift" CVT. Gas mileage is right where I left off with my Accord, hoping it gets even better with more miles, and a long trip under it's belt. This is my first car that is actually "purchased" and am glad this is one I get to hang onto for a while.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in 2004 Altima for 2007 with SL and electronics package. Recent road trip easily yielded 34-36 MPG @ 60-65 MPH with A/C. 70-75 MPH drops mileage by about 3 MPG. City MPG so far is about 22 MPG, lower than the rating but about 10% better than my 2004 Nissan with the same engine. Mileage should be even better after adequate break-in. Interior design overall is very good. Seat bottoms are a little firm. Ride is excellent, some road noise on bad surfaces but generally very low noise factor. Exterior design is an eye catcher, have received several unsolicited compliments. Integrated bluetooth phone generally works well, some trouble with voice commands but still learning.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've considered Accord, Sonata and Camry. I'm happy I made the right decision. I had the car for 2 months so far. Very good engine power (forget the 6 cyl) and brakes. Very fun to drive. Mileage about 20/28 mpg with 1,300m so far. Roomy interior. On one hand, disappointed with some creaky plastics on the door panels and below the driver seat. On the other hand, the dashboard is very attractive and made with very good plastic quality. Nissan should use a better plastic quality for the door panels. Overall very nice car! I would recommend this car to a friend.</TEXT>

Had the car for 1 week went on a 12 hour round trip and go 32-34 mpg driving 70 to 80 mph. Have always been a cloth person but I was glad to go with the leather. Always been a jeep person but I love this Altima. It's my first.</TEXT>

<TEXT>10s across the board. After driving the competition (Fusion, Accord, Camry), this Altima smokes them all. Best in class looks, performance and option/feature availability. The interior is comfortable yet sporty. Great lines on the exterior that does not blend in with all the other cars on the road. Performs very well and still gets around 23-24 MPG hwy/city combination driving. Drive one and you will be impressed. Very happy with our decision to purchase (as you could probably tell).</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought this car but since I live 3 hours away from the dealership, I have had that much time behind the wheel. I traded a 2003 3.5 se for the 2.5 S. That power difference from the two are like night and day, but I saved a few thousand and am overall happy with my purchase. The new style is better than anything in it's price range. It actually looks better in person than in photos. I chose the 6 speed manual over the CVT, I drove both but the CVT did not offer that same sporty feel as the manual. Overall, if you want a greal looking reliable car in this price range - this is it. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I still can't believe how great this car looks. I'm sure the "awe" will wear off eventually, but it beats all other competitors in styling both inside and out. The 2.5 is not fast, but it never feels lost for power. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the new car. Have had it for a week and it is every bit as fun to drive as I'd hoped. Best of all, since I sprung for the window security etching and the lojack, the discounts we got on our auto insurance makes it no more expensive to insure than what I was paying for my corolla. I haven't really pushed the engine much, but I can tell that if I did punch it, I'd be pressed back into my seat. It rides and handles very similiar to my wife's more expensive BMW 325is. In other words, it corners like it's on rails. Ride is stiff (sport suspension) but the roads here are pretty smooth, so no big deal. Steering is very precise, not mushy at all. I'd definitely recommend the car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The fit and finish quality is excellent. The layout and handling are near perfect. The push button start is cool and never gets old - a constant reminder that I'm living in the 21st century! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just a few days of ownership and have mixed feelings. Glad we went with the 4 cyl., power and handling seem fine. Traded a Murano and that car was so much heavier than the Altima along with quieter. Drove on the highway in pouring rain and one would think we were in a tin can. The interior compartments are loud with our belongings rattling around. Even the side door panels feel cheap. Haven't found my Bose system to be anything special either. I do love the keyless entry. Love the navigation, much improved from our last one. Gas is too soon to tell, hoping it gets better. Perhaps I'll enjoy it more as I get accustomed to it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2.5S with convenience plus package gives all the "must have" features at a reasonable price. Great bang for the buck. The CVT engine is very smooth. Mileage is great, 28-30 mpg so far with mostly city driving, yet the car has plenty of pickup to accelerate onto the highway with ease. Keyless entry without having to take the key fob out of your pocket and push button start is great novelty feature that comes in very handy. Both front and back seats are very roomy on inside, seats are very comfortable. Could not be happier with our new Altima! </TEXT>

<TEXT>At first I was skeptical about the new Nissan but after test driving it, the car surprised me in many ways. I bought the 2.5 SL package and I love everything about it. It is a nice quality ride with great sound (if you get the Bose). It looks sharp and runs even sharper. I really have no complaints so far either. For a four door sedan, I've recieve many compliments for its sporty look and great looking interior. The new Nissan also gets great pick-up for a four-cylinder and has excellent gas mileage. Excellent choice of a car for the price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the SL package. The bluetooth, 6-disc CD changer, Sirius satellite radio, Bose sound, moonroof, dual climate control, heated seats, and leather are all pluses. CVT is also a cool feature along with the autostick or what I like to call, "the cheap mans stick." I also love the gas mileage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I decided to wait 6 mos before writing a review of this car. Let's say that it's just ok for a daily driver. The v6 is advertised as having 270 hp, somehow I think that's not entirely true. The AC is lacking punch, The steering is ultra light, the handling even with SE trim is floaty, build quality is better than last gen but not by much, the brakes are pretty much dead if one must make a sudden stop from say 50 mph, lots of fade, the gas mileage is horrible even when taking it easy on the engine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is exactly what you pay for: lots of room, great gas mileage, peppy engine, and great looks for a car at around $20k. I got the Premium Plus option and have everything I need without paying a fortune. Loading this baby up gets pricey real quick, and the 2.5 gets it done adequately, although it may sound a little loud with the windows down. The CVT is really smooth and takes some getting used to (can't notice the shifts). Great on the highway with ample power for passing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love it! I went for the fully loaded SE model with tech package. I was deciding between the Lexus IS, Infiniti G35, Acura TL and the Altima blew them away, and for 10k less! The bluetooth is amazing. Using my cell phone through the car has perfect sound quality. No need to yell. The CVT is also impressive, power will never be a problem. The acceleration is so fast that I haven't even come close to flooring the gas pedal. One thing to note is that the CVT does "hold" the car when you let off the gas pedal. Similar feeling to when you have cruise control on and are driving down a hill. Only major gripe are the seats. Very stiff and uncomfortable, even with the lumbar support. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have traded in our third Accord for the new 07 Altima. Very good driving impressions so far. It came with the SL package that included leather interior and moonroof along with other conveniences. Lot of storage area in the trunk. Although you need to get used to it, the CVT is something else. The 4 cyl. engine outperforms some 6 cylinders out there. Folks at Nissan did their homework well. Definitely, a car to drive.</TEXT>

The Altima has more room and you can get a navigation system on the base model. I got the 3.5 SE with the technology package and added the rear spoiler and fog lights and I love this car.

I tried the Camry, Accord, Jetta and A4 and this was my top pick. The 6 spd manual is very easy to use with a light clutch, beautiful exterior design, lots of leg room front and rear, beats the competition hands down, from acceleration to interior design. If you want a fast (0-60 MPH 5.9 sec) and high quality (rivals G35 and Lexus), try this car before you make your decision. You will be impressed, drives like a much more expensive car than it is. Great road trip car, comfortable with little road noise. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched all the mid-size sedans. I love the Infiniti G35, but opted for mpg over high performance. The Camry and Accord are too boring. The Altima looks better and the 2.5L CVT gets better mpg than the other two. I orginally wanted the 3.5, but drove the 2.5l and was impressed with its power! (I drove 5.3L v8 before.) I agree that to get some of the features I wanted I had to buy the SL and the Connection package to get the Bose and CD changer. But really for the price it is still affordable. </TEXT>

From its classy and streamlined style, roomy interior, to the powerful performance from the 4-cylinder CVT, I love this car. I didn't test drive the 6-cyl, it was over my budget, but the 4 has me merging into traffic with no problems. The CVT is buttery smooth. Interior storage and cup holders are plentiful, a huge advantage over my 2000. My BF and I find the firm seats supportive. Rear seat psgrs have great leg room. I love the pushbutton start and the push button entrance feature on the doors and trunk - no fumbling for keys. Getting 30 mpg so far. Love showing it off - very happy!</TEXT>

The gas mileage is wonderful, especially with the way gas prices are right now! I get so many compliments on it! It drives so smooth! I go through at least 1 car per year, but I think I might keep this one for awhile. It is just the best one so far that I've owned. Definitely a keeper! If you are looking to buy an Altima, I would put it at the top of the list to check out. I love it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought January 2007. Have only driven a thousand or so miles due to other travels, but the 4-cylinder engine is exceptionally well matched to the CVT transmission, giving it as much pull as a much larger engine. The bluetooth connection is the best I have ever heard; it almost completely cancels road noise for the listener and allows great range control for volume within the car. The seats are comfy for the short drives we have taken it on and our one highway trip averaged in the low 30s for mpg at 70+ mph. My experience with other new cars tells me this will increase as it the mechanical bits loosen up a little. She jumps off the starting line with an amazing amount of kick for a 4-cyl.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Before this Altima, I had an Infiniti Q45 and I am glad I traded it in. This Altima has plenty of room, it performs on the road with plenty of power considering it has only a 4 cylinder engine. I get great gas mileage (22.5 mpg city driving: short trips, 5 miles or less). I love the keyless entry and start. I don't have to look for the keys to enter the car or start it. The only drawback I see is the engine noise when accelerating. I have had this for 5 months already, and I have not had any problems with it. I compared the Altima to the Camry and the Accord, and I consider you get more for your money with the Altima. I love the dual exaust pipes and the exterior look.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Minus side: If you have spine, back, or neck problems, this is not the car for you. The seats are unbelievably hard, do not conform to the body and poorly designed headrests do not allow driver to sit straight & lean against the back of the seat. Even with power seat adjustments, this car is very uncomfortable, although it may not be a problem for younger folks without back problems who seem to be the majority favoring this car and its "sporty" drive. The headrests also present a safety issue because they are difficult to see around, increasing strain on the neck. On the plus side, it is a beautiful car with lots of power.

The build I purchased has no lumbar adjustment and my back constantly aches after 20 minutes or so of driving. I am 6'2" and 220 pounds so my experience may be very different from others. My old 2000 CR-V had far more comfortable seats. Perhaps time will soften the foam. :) </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is an excellent car for its price range. It is a good fit in size for a person 6'2. The fuel economy is good, 30-31, but not 35 as rated. Its standard safety features are a plus. The car is a little noisy on initial acceleration but is quiet at speed. Acceleration when driving at 55 mph, then passing is quiet and quick. The cvt transmission does not work as well when the engine and weather are both cold (below 30 degree weather) , the high revving before smoothing out made my daughter think it was defective. Heat and air fans are quiet and effective. Seating position and comfort are very good. Seeing around the headrest and rear visibility is a bit of a challenge at first drive. </TEXT>

This is a fun car to drive. Nary a rattle, fit, finish are excellent. Why pay more for a G35 and RWD. Torque steer is gone. I can't rate the 2007 highly enough.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought my first Nissan after looking at many midsize sedans. Really liked the new design of the Altima and for the money it comes with great features: push button start, keyless entry, CVT trans, steering audio controls and all the airbags. Drove a few other sedans, but the CVT 4 cyl really has the other companys 4 cyls beat, love the pick-up and sound of the engine. Noticed some bad blind spots in some other makes, no problems in the Altima. The layout of the interior is well thought out, everything is easy to reach. Have only had the car for 12 days but really love it. Went on one drive of over 150 miles and it rode very well. Drive a lot of mixed city/hwy and last fillup got 28 mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT trans, steering wheel audio controls, moonroof, overall steering/ handling on the road, keyless entry and push button start, its so nice not to have to get out the keys!! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just traded my '07 Camry XLE for the Altima SE V-6 with premium and sport packages. It also has stability control known as VDC by Nissan. This is truly an awesome car, that provides a firm but controlled ride, lots of power, handling is superb as you might expect in he SE version. The Bose stereo is nice, but not as nice as the JBL synthesis I had in my '05 Avalon. The CVT transmission is nothing short of spectacular. there is a slight learning curve. The Nissan has a sportier interior than the Camry that was more luxurious. The leather is of a high quality. Gas mileage is just ok, but still acceptable. I am pleased with my decision and look forward to enjoy the ride.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've written one review already after owning the car for a couple days. It's now been 2 months. I have to say overall not a bad car but having driven it 2000 miles now I am concerned about drift. Even with no winds the car tends to drift especially at higher speeds (65 plus). And the drift is sudden left or sudden right. Sometimes it can be quiet alarming. I've never owned another car that did this. Could be just mine. Going to the dealer next week to get suspension and steering looked at but be careful and pay attention to the test drive before buying and if you already bought like me then pay attention and get it looked at if needed</TEXT>

The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have some of the features that was install or come standard with the car is signal light in the side mirror, and the on star. Overall the car is a wonderful car. Drives very well on the highway and city. For a 4 cycle is has a lot of power. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Thank you Nissan for making the Altima available with a stick in all trim models. Especially now, that the Maxima does not come this way any longer. My SE M6 is a true pleasure to drive. Good power, awesome looks, decent interior. I was ready to buy the new Camry back in October, but someone convinced me to wait a week or two for the new Altima. And, boy, was it ever worth it! It is a beautiful car. Unlike the Camry or the aged Accord, the new Altima has FUN written all over. Thank you Nissan! I couldn't possibly find a better car for my middle-age crisis.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Within 3 weeks after buying my car, I stopped for gas. After refueling, the car would not start. I tried to contact the consumer affairs number in the owner's manual. They stop answering at 5 PM Eastern. I contacted the dealership where I purchased the car. They told me to call one closer to where my car had broken down. No they couldn't tell me where there was a closer dealership. They suggested I "find a phone book." Have you looked for a phone book along the interstate lately? They then informed me that I was "on my own" The next day, I contacted the consumer affairs people at 1-800-Nissan- 1. Confirmed that this is what I should expect.</TEXT>

<TEXT>There are many qualities that I enjoy about my Nissan Altima, but there are a few that I am not so crazy about. I will start with the positive qualities first. The 2007 altima's interior is very spacious. I also really enjoy the push button start.... The audio features sound great, and it looks much sportier than some of the other cars in its class. However, I do have some complaints about the car. The driver's seat is very uncomfortable after about 20-30 minutes of driving. I find that my back usually hurts after long trips. Also, today it was 70 degrees here and my inside temp. said it was 41! The check engine light comes on from time to time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Had my Altima in frost white for a week. Fully loaded with light leather, keeps it cooler in Florida when the sun's out. The CVT is great, sooo smoooth, you can't feel any gear change, and the engine has great power.It can catch you off guard if when you first pull away. The sat system is well, not bad to use, but has a large manual. You need to sit down with it for a while to understand it. Great ride, good sound with the Bose system and the back up camera is good if not a bit gimmicky, I still use my mirrors. 'Plenty' of space in the trunk, its quite deceiving when you look at it from outside.I'm very impressed with the whole car and I did look at quite a few and got the lowdown about them.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our second Altima. We just traded in our 2002 with 93,000 miles and got the new 2.5S with the SL package. One word to describe it is: AWESOME!!! It is black w/ black leather interior. It drives like a dream with the CVT transmission. We have heated seats, bluetooth, XM, Bose sound system and much more! These are all of the perks of a much higher priced vehicle, in an Altima. We thought about Camry and Accord, but you just can't compare the features for the price and quality of this Nissan. If you haven't driven one, do so before you buy your next vehicle. You will be glad you gave Altima a chance! We love ours!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had the car for about a month now and I love the performance. The CVT trans makes it accelerate like it is in one gear the whole time while you hit 70 mph. Nice smooth feel driving around town. The bump are noticeable but what do you expect from such a sport susp that will hug a corner like a smaller car. Car seats fit well in this model with the anchor. Every time I take off with my kid she says WhooOOO, my thought exactly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had this car for less than 48 hrs. and finding out a lot of things I really don't like. Sunroof was not working, so I was really down thinking I had to take it back to the dealer. After some reading I find out it just doesn't work like it should, and this is the gist of what I really hate about this car. Nothing is directly controlled. Everything from the "pushbutton start" to the sunroof and who knows what else, is just a signal being sent to a cpu to run a sequence to do the work. Had I known this, i'd never considered buying it. I told the salesperson I'd gladly pay more not to have the stupid electronic key thing. It's just an expensive trinket waiting to break. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After reading a few reviews, I don't understand many of the complaints--this car is not so bad. We've had it for two months now, and it is a fun, stylish, well-performing car with lots of room. And we also have a C5 'vette and a Mustang GT to compare to. Handling and acceleration are very good, and noise level is better than the BMW 735 we had. Unfortunately the in-town gas mileage is about as bad as the GT, ~17 mpg--the 'vette gets 19-20! And the GT suspension is much less comfortable than the Altima. In comparison buying, it was impossible to get a Honda in the colors and options we wanted, Toyota doesn't have a V6+MT, and the others were too $$. Plus we got $2500 off MSRP. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I almost bought a Maxima, but drove an Altima at the last minute and was sold. This car is a blast to drive with the CVT. The engine is very quiet and interior cabin noise is almost as quiet as my Lexus. The suspension is a bit firmer than I'm used to but not overbearing. I immediately traded in the stock tires for Michelin pilot exalto A/T's and noticed a huge difference in snow performance and a slight increase in ride comfort. I am also removing the crap bose speaker system (paper cones) for Orion. Don't really care for the placement of the front dash speakers, makes for an odd sound stage. Overall, for the money.......this is a great vehicle, way to go Nissan. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have the 3.5 SE, CVT with minimal options...actually almost none other than spoiler, mats, fog lights and kick plates. The 2007 is a vast improvement over the previous model in design and fit and finish. Body gaps are minimal. Interior materials seem to be a much higher quality. One reviewer mention big blind spots but must be using badly adjusted mirrors. Virtually no blind spots. Engine is smooth and can hit higher digits really fast. CVT is great and does a great job of moving to a lower ratio when you need the engine breaking. I'm glad I got this rather than the manual. Seats are firm which I like. My lower back doesn't ache after my hour long commute. Handles like a smaller car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love this car. This is my third nissan (sentra, and 200sx) and I'm glad I stuck with them. Having owned 2 others, I know how reliable and problem free they are. With the altima, you add to that styling, power, and exceptional comfort and room. But, at a much better price than a camry or accord. the CVT is amazing. It allows for a noticeable boost in power even at high speeds, but will also employ engine braking on steep slopes. The interior looks as if, well, nissan finally figured out how to design a car interior. And the "intelligent key" is quite impressive. Kind of makes the act of fumbling around for keys seem primitive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought my Altima about a year ago. LOVED this car all summer. It's quick, very light handling, and has very responsive breaks. But then it snowed. I live in rural central New York so we get some serious snow storms, I spent most of the winter in my apartment because the car was so bad. I have driven front wheel vehicles all my life and have never had a problem, even in storms when people with trucks didn't want to go out. On ice, however, this car is GREAT!!! Just not if there is more than a dusting of snow on the road. So if you live in a southern state or never leave a city up north you'll be fine. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After 9 years in my 97 Maxima GLE, I thought I wanted an Acura TL or TSX, but the premium fuel requirement and stiff ride put me off. My dealer had a 2 yr. old red 2.5SL with blonde interior and I was sold. So far I really like it - lots of nice features - dual climate control, rear A/C vent, compass/autodimming/Homelink rear view mirror, manual shift mode, steering wheel audio controls. The on-center feel/highway tracking doesn't seem to be as good as the Maxima, but it drives very well. I miss the quality of the Bose stereo and the lateral support in the driver's seat during corners. Mileage is quite good so far and it pulls very strongly.

As other reviewers have said there has been nothing but recall after annoying recall. I absolutely loved driving this car, but about 2 months ago, it started to just not feel right. Long story short, I just had to have the front breaks completely replaced (calipers, rotors, etc) and had to have a NEW TRANSMISSION installed. All was under warranty, but give me a break! I love the way Nissans look, and they are FUN to drive when they run correctly, but I will never own one again. I highly UNrecommend this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car used with 19K on it after cross shopping many other models. Great car for small family (< 3 kids). This car is a quick performer with a sportier ride than many competitors (e.g., Camry). I get better than advertised gas mileage with the manual when I am easy on the gas. The controls are logically laid out and easy to use. I like the keyless feature (it's even easy to replace the FOB battery), but HATE the FOB itself (see below). I have driven manual trans. cars for years and years, but this one is very difficult to drive smoothly, especially from 1st to 2nd. I suspect that the gear spacing is just poorly planned. With the exception of the FOB this is a great car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Let me first say, I get a new car about every 2 years, because I get bored easily. This car is everything I had hoped it would be. It is loaded with the 3.5SE, 270hp, leather, and navigation. It had 32k miles, but drives like brand new. The comfort is excellent, but could use a little softer seats. The performance is up there with the best. It competes with most BMW's, Mercedes, Jaguars and other high dollar vehicles. Braking is better than others have given credit. Handling on the SE is excellent. Controls/interior design is perfect for me. Overall this car is outstanding. I see keeping it in my driveway for a long time. Now my wife wants one after owning a loaded 06 Passat.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have always owned SE's (Nissan/Toyota), so typically we don't really consider non- SE models. May re-think this next time. When you initially drive the 07 Alt SE, you'll get an inital rush similiar to driving a Z. However, just like the Z, for the long-term make sure you really want to live with the sport-tuned (SE) model. It does indeed handle impressively, but not surprisingly it does not soak up bumps all that well on a less than smooth road. This is exacerbated by the very firm front seats. In other words, Nissan really took things to the limit. I suggest taking very long test drives before making your decision, particularly with the new CVT trans.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have 1,100 miles on my 2.5 SL. Very powerful and fun to drive, but it does not get the rated mileage. I am 6'4" and have plenty of room in the front seats. The back seat, however does not have a lot of headroom. The computer is not accurate as far as displaying the miles per gallon, but is a nice touch. I test drove the Camry (did not like it) and the Accord (close second). My only concern is whether it will hold it's resale value. There is more engine noise when the car is cold and when accelerating. Cruising is OK.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a former Rental car manager. I had a different car everyday. I have driven everything from a Camry to Infiniti G35. My last car was a Honda Accord 04' Was totaled 3 weeks ago on the freeway because of three things. Black ice, Bad factory tires, no traction controlled. I am actually excited when I get in this car because you pay $24k for a car that is worth $38K. The CVT has constant power. Getting on a freeway 0-80 mph with no shifting in the trans is amazing. It handles like it is on rails. (cornering is good). The last model altima's I drove had a lot of torque steer. Nissan fixed that problem on this model. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just recently bought the 2007 Altima with the CVT..I got the SL package, Bose Stereo with Sirius, Rear Spoiler, splash guards, and ABS. Man this car is fun to drive. For a 4 cylinder it has some good pick up. I definitely recommend that you get the Bose stereo..The car I bought invoiced at $24,915 and paid $24,500..so I'm happy with that...and Pebble Beach exterior looks sharp with Black leather interior. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first purchase of a brand new car. I love everything about this car. The intelligent key is AWESOME! Door unlocks when you get within a certain range as does the trunk. The instrument panel is laid out very nicely and the instruments are very easy to use. Altimas are mainly known as being drove by a lot of women but the 07s look sporty enough for men to drive. The front is a cross between a Nissan Maxima and a 350 Z. Gives it an aggressive stance. The back end reminds you of a Lexus. Lots of room on the inside. Trunk is HUGE. The seats are very comfortable. Ride is very smooth. I jump in my car just to drive down the street because its so fun to drive. I HIGHLY recommend</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 3 weeks 07 Altima 3.5 SE has been a lot of fun to drive. Looks great inside and out. Great interior layout. I'm glad Nissan got rid of their childish scoped orange speedo/tach. However fit and finish still has some significant body gaps (granted its only been in production a few months). CVT isn't all that quick nor fuel efficient (average 20 mpg in mixed driving), what was the point in doing this? This car does not coast along (or even down large hills). Hopefully it will be reliable to makeup for this. Suspension is very stiff, you will feel every bump in the pavement. Also has HUGE blind spots (so does Camry SE) making highway merging difficult. </TEXT>

<TEXT>i love this car,a lot of bang for your buck.good power for a 4 cylinder, great aerodynamics, good interior design. love the smart key, makes feeling of german luxury. all round this is a great car,my only gripe would be the quality of the factory paint, i only put 500 miles of all highway driving and noticed many paint chips on the nose and lower passenger side door. i live in new york and we really have not had any snow so salt wouldn't be to blame. i think car manufacturers are cutting many corners to turn in more profit!i will contact nissan to try and solve this matter being i am leasing i do not want to incur any more damage and be held responsible when my 3 years are up.please get the nose mask</TEXT>

<TEXT>I sold my 2001 Maxima for this car. The 2007 Altima SE V6 6-spd manual is an incredible sport sedan. It's slightly bigger than my '01 Maxima, has 50+ more horsepower than the '01 Maxima, was thousands cheaper, and gets better mileage. It's basically the fastest front wheel drive car you can buy. There are two exceptions... the Mazdaspeed 3 and the Acura TL Type S. The Mazda 3 is almost the same price and is smaller than a Civic. The Acura TL Spec B is a 38k machine and is only 0.1sec fast in the 0-60. The 6speed manual is taken right from the 350Z and is a dream. Motor Trend specs the 0-60 in 5.9 seconds... in a front wheel drive car! I get ~24mpg average and ~27-28 highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car 2 days ago so take it for what its worth but I've been an altima owner for over 7 years now. I just traded my '00 Altima SE for this '07 Altima 2.5 S with the SL package. I really liked my first Altima but all I can say now is WOW!. What a difference. If the '00 Altima was the epitome of playing it safe, dependable, all around family sedan then the '07 is all those things but on super steroids. This car is awesome. I wanted something safe and that had seating for 2 adults and 3 children comfortably for those family times but that also had the get up and go and sporty look so as to be fun to drive. This Altima does it all and does it well. I couldn't be more satisfied</TEXT>

<TEXT>i have the 2.5 S with sl, tech, and abs pack. wanted an 07 g, but pmt made the budget too tight. this is a very solid compromise. interior materials are better than in past versions. though they kept the body style similar, there are a lot of little changes that make this a great looking vehicle. all my ratings were based on the features of the car...ie it's a 4 cylinder, but as far as four bangers go, excellent performance...and so on. i haven't broke it in yet, so gas mileage should improve. reliability has been constantly improved every year on this line, and based on the materials used inside, i think it will improve again this year. if not, i'm only in a 2-year lease, so no harm no foul.</TEXT>

The acceleration is great once the car is broken in, passing is easy and breaks are great. Love the push button start, everyone that sees it is like WOW just like a Lexus or Mercedes. Makes ya feel good. Only bad thing I would say is that the fuel economy is rated 22- 26. Window sticker says actual is more like 18-24. I'm getting 16.7mpg mixed driving. But hey guess you can't get it all, performance and mileage. Overall, GREAT CAR!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great car. It is very close to Honda/Toyota levels of fit and finish. My 3.5SE has the Sport Package and an auto dimming mirror. The interior is nicely styled and the instrument cluster is very bright and easy to read with good radio and HVAC controls. The seats are well shaped though they are a little hard and don't offer a lumber adjustment. The ride and handling compromise is great; it handles very well without punishing you when you hit a bump. Overall, reliability should be on par with Honda/Toyota. This is a great contender in the midsize category. I highly recommend this car if you don't want to overspend on a Toyota or Honda; their dealers who don't ever offer deals. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love my V6 engine with the CVT. The CVT keeps the engine in the optimal power range so you can always accelerate hard no matter what your speed is.

1) cvt transmission - no stress over timing belts like the ones in toyota/honda 
2) More of a car vs price you pay - intelligent key, push start engine, stylish front panel + lot roomier than toyota/honda & above all slick exterior design (makes me feel like I'm driving G-35 OR Lexus IS)

<TEXT>Got my 2007 Altima new in 2007, and now have 30,000 miles without any issues. Quiet, comfortable, economical, and reliable. I have the 2.5 engine with CVT and get about 22 mpg around town and 35 mpg on open road. The CVT is a great invention because it allows small engines to provide power or economy, depending on driver demands. This is a "drive by wire" vehicle since the accelerator goes to the computer, not the engine speed. The 2.5 engine is adequate and uses regular gas so don't waste your money on the 3.5 engine that requires high test gas. If something happened to this car, I would definitely get another Altima.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It is a good little car. It has good acceleration even with a 4 cyl. It is good looking and stylish. It does not get the gas mileage that the tags said, but I had already known that none of Nissan's vehicles get what the tags say. The paint chips easily and it rusts easily when the paint is chipped (keep a bottle of touch-up paint on hand). Plastic cowling on bottom of car makes it a pain to change the oil by yourself. The intelligent key and push button starting are great features (I have to keep my friends from playing with the door locks though). All in all, it is a good little car that will work well for you as long as you pay attention to it once in a while.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car, but with the standard seats it's not comfortable on long trips--no lumbar support, and the head rest pushes your head forward in an awkward position. But I think that is typical of most cars nowadays. The tires typical of Nissan OEM tires only lasted about 36K miles. Great acceleration esp. considering mpg which is 27-28 on the highway. The main beef I had when buying this car was that you are forced into buying a $10K "technology package" if you want the nice stereo with Sirius radio. The standard stereo does have an mp3 jack which I use for my Sirius plug-in. Electronic key is great & prevents locking your keys in the trunk.</TEXT>

Car is very sporty compared to the Impala we traded, like the "quick" responses of this car.

<TEXT>Just a word of warning for anyone wanting to keep the CVT Altima for any length of time. My CVT just imploded with 46,000 km on it. Maybe warranty they say, maybe not. Takes two days to do the paperwork to get the new transmission approved... if it gets approved. Not impressed. The car is very noisy when driving and lurches when going downhill. I will never buy another CVT again. I can only imagine the cost of replacement for this thing. This will be a real cash cow for Nissan as the trannies start to fail.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in an suv for this vehicle because I was looking for something with better gas mileage, saw the window sticker on this car and thought it was good, it says 34 highway, it's more like 20 highway! The paint started peeling off my bumper at 1,000 miles. I have had my brakes fixed 3 times for squeaking issues and the car only has 13,000 miles on it. If you have a problem don't waste your time trying to call Nissan Consumer Affairs, they don't return calls. I have owned many vehicles and this is by far the worst! The car rattles, my cd player screen goes blank, it's just not a good vehicle at all, especially for the price. Never again will I buy another Nissan!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my 2007 Nissan Altima SE with the 6-speed transmission. It handles like a dream and can accelerate as quick as anything that I have driven. I am getting close to 27 MPG even though it is only supposed to get 19/27. I love the fact that I could get a reliable mid size sedan with a 6 cylinder engine and a manual transmission. It truly is a sports sedan that Honda and Toyota don't offer; a 6 cylinder with a manual transmission.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We loved the styling and perks of the 2.5SL, and we loved the car for the first 2500 miles. Its been downhill fast from there- the car has been in the shop about 10 times in the first year of ownership. In addition to many smaller issues, we have had the transmission replaced, the exhaust pipes replaced, and the computer reprogrammed three times for a very rough idle. The car rattles like an old chevy truck, and they can't figure out why. Isn't legally a lemon, so we traded it- for a Honda. Will NEVER own another Nissan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had the vehicle for just under one year, when I started to experience power drain problems and complete "shut-downs". I have used roadside assistance four times in the last five months, since the car was completely dead. The dealership has tried to fix the problem, but they haven't yet. Other, than this 'major problem', I loved the car: great ride, great power for a four cylinder, great design, great fuel economy. I have had four Nissan's in the last 10 years. This is the only one with a major problem, however, this one is fully equipped with navigation, back- up camera, heated seats, and everything possible.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The was an excellent choice for my wife. She drives 35 miles to work each way and she was looking for a car that got good gas mileage. We were looking for an inexpensive vehicle (under 20K). Looked @ Accord LX, slow acceleration and cheap looking interior. Camry CE wasn't much better. Nissan CVT is a smooth (excellent trans) and gives a feel of good acceleration. The car is a good combination of handling and comfort. It corners well, yet still has a smooth ride. The list for new was 24k we were able to get a used one with 5k miles for 16k. First fill up with mostly city driving it got 30 mpg. 35 hwy mpg is reachable with the right driving habits.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Still in love with it. I have the 6 speed manual and have gotten as high as 42 mpg, and this isn't a hybrid. I usually get around 35-38 mpg and that is combined city/highway. I do see that the cruise control helps a lot with the mileage. Love the way the car looks and feels. Could handle a little bit better in the snow as we get lots in the Buffalo area, but it isn't that bad that I wouldn't drive it or don't feel safe. I tried many cars before I bought this, like the Accord/Civic, Jetta (which was my 2nd pick), Madza3, Impala, G6... wasn't looking for a certain size, just what I liked. It has over 14000 miles on it now and can't wait to put on another 15000 this year!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first impression was very favorable - fun to drive, enough power for 4cyl, good MPG. Comfortable inside, although noisy. I drive to work 150 miles each day. After 12K miles problems started to come up like ants. Fuel gauge, airbag sensor, "service engine", battery, suspension, not to mention numerous other smaller problems. Several times, when I picked up the car from the dealer with one problem fixed, I would have to turn around and drive back because another problem popped up while I am taking car home. Talk to the dealer, talk to Nissan - they do not care. Going to trade it and never buy again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Altima about 3 days ago and absolutely love it! It has a quick engine for a 4 cylinder and is very roomy! Am going down from a minivan to a sedan and love it. The amount of room is great along with the view out all the windows, everything is in good proportion. Am going out today to buy another fob for it, that intelligent system is awesome and the push button start. I feel when I drive it that I got a lot more for my money, I got a good price, good mileage, and am 110% happy with my decision. If you're trying to decide between a 2007 Altima, Accord, or Camry, go with the Altima - you won't regret it. What's great is the styling inside and out, push button start and peppiness!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a Nissan master technician with 30 years in Nissan dealerships. I normally don't get too excited when the new models come out, but after attending new model training on the 07 Altima, and just sitting in one, it just "felt right", and knew I had to have one. Driving the 3.5 V6 was the clincher. I have had it for 18 months and 24,000 miles with no major complaints as far as reliability and drivetrain performance. It keeps up with anything off the line. After 30 mph, it really takes off. Use premium fuel or you will notince some slight hesitation in midrange RPM. Climbing long steep grades with the CVT is impressive when you're passing everything else on the road. A great car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the car, I never thought that I would own an Altima but when I saw the new body style I had to test drive it. Was planning on buying an 07 Toyota Camry S, but once I got into the Altima the power and push button start got me. Ended up with the white 3.5 SE w/6 speed. I always get compliments on the car. I drive the hell out of it and still get about 300 miles to a tank of gas. Overall it?s a great buy and would recommend it anyone!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This was the worst purchase we ever made. I personally have owned 27 cars in my lifetime so I am good judge of vehicles. Although it looks great and is pretty quick. This car got poor city mileage and had nothing but problems. Passenger air bag did not work for 8000 miles until seat was replaced, brakes kept locking up and left rear wheel was about to fall off the car. Then before we could take it in the front windows were activated by thunder during a storm and when we came out the next day the car had 1 inch of water inside and the dash, console, doors and seats were soaking wet, basically like flood damage. I would not buy this car ever again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Nissan purchase and it will be my last. Two weeks after I purchased the car, I had to bring it to the dealership to have the battery replaced. A couple months later the service engine soon light came on and I had to bring it to the dealship. The car stayed in the shop all day only to find out they had to order fuel filler tube so I had to bring it in again! My paint is chipping, the electronic seat button on the drivers seat has fallen off, the arm rest on the interior of the car always pop out of place. This was a relatively low priced car, but these are things that should not go wrong in the first year of a cars life! Overall I'm not a happy camper!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 2000 Saab 93 convert. because it was just time. My wife has the Murano and we love it and I just needed something to get me to and from the train station everyday. This car has better pick up than my Saab and handles better overall. I used to drive 5 spd for many years so the +/- shift is fun to drive from time to time and I found it works great in the snow/ice to avoid breaking when going down hills. I went real basic on all the features and I don't feel like I am missing anything. The steering is a little loose compared to what I have been driving before (Saab 93 and VW GTI), but it is really a nice car inside and out!! The stereo is pretty good without the bose upgrade.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Three days after purchasing this car, I was involved in an accident in which I did multiple 360s on an interstate going 80 mph and ended up spinning into and out of a 4 foot ditch twice, completely smashing in both the front end and the rear end. I was wearing my seatbelt, however my dog (in the passenger seat) was not (and did not have benefit of an airbag like I did)! My dog and I both walked out of the car with VERY minor bumps and bruises (mostly from the seatbelt and airbag). I'm so upset that I lost my Altima but I am definitely buying another one as soon as I can. This car saved my life (and my dog's life). The paramedics couldn't believe I survived and neither could I.

When I drove the 2.5S Altima I couldn't believe how strong and powerful the engine is. It can keep up with everything on the road. I love the gas mileage. It gets 35 mpg with all highway driving. With all city driving it gets about 22 mpg. The cvt is smooth and responsive and the car feels solid and sure on highways. The seats felt a little too firm at first but now I'm used to them.

Never ever have I a loved a car so much. I dont feel like getting out of my Nissan and I take longer route to reach home late. I drove 600 miles on highway with full tank averaging 34 miles/gallon. After driving the CVT tech, driving my friends conventional cars with freq jerks of gear shift are no more a pleasure even with V6.</TEXT>

Since I have owned this car, I have been in love with the styling. Great performance that comes instantly when you push on the gas. Smooth shifting, and pretty good fuel economy for 270 horsepower. The keyless start is another great option, as well as the lock and unlock feature that just requires the push of botton on the door handle.

<TEXT>Plain and simple, I do not like this car. Stereo speakers rattle like crazy. Random banging noises coming from all around the car when driving. Tires are crap and the car drifts and sways on the highway. Wind noise on highway is awful, I feel like I'm flying a plane. There is a big dent on my trunk for no reason that I know of, and that's probably because the trunk is made of complete tin and any little thing will dent it. CVT jerks and sounds funny especially it's the tiniest bit cold out. Interior side piece of the dash is warped and coming off. Dealer doesn't fix issues like they're supposed to. Sometimes I wish it would get totaled out so I could get a different car. Save yourself. RUN!</TEXT>

Has the safety features that are optional on the other cars standard and the 6 cyl is well worth it. I average 27 miles to the gallon, mostly highway and don't need to step on the gas to get around people like a 4 cyl would. The car is great, but the service I've received from several dealers is lacking. Already had to fix the CV joint boot, there was a tear in it. It was under warranty. It has better gas mileage than the V8s I considered and it's just as fast b/c it's lighter. </TEXT>

<TEXT>It drives very smooth and is a nice ride, (nicer than the SE but Im sure it has to do with the stabilizer bars on the SL). I wish it had 18" wheels but that would probably have been at the expense of some of the comfort in the ride. I also looked at an 08 Accord VG w/nav and the controls in the thing made me feel like I should have gotten training in the space shuttle. There were so many buttons and knobs everywhere it would have taken forever to learn. But, the Altima has all the same features but in simple easy to use arrangement on the dash. The nav system is easy to understand and well thought out instruments great car, good drive, all I would ever want or need.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive 130 miles to work, five days a week. When it was time for a new car, I wanted something roomy inside, fun to drive and good on gas. I purchased the smaller 2.5L engine for fuel economy. (I've got the CVT.) I added the SL package to beef up the interior as I'd be spending a lot of time in my car. The smaller engine puts out a surprising amount of power and makes the drive fun while the SL package interior looks great. Like a much more expensive car. The gas mileage is good considering I drive on a major highway at 72 mph on cruise for 90% of my miles. I get about 27 mpg. 14,000 miles in five months and the car is holding up great. I couldn't be happier with this purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I am really impressed with the power of the smaller engine. It's powerful enough to accelerate quickly and pass when you need it. Fun! I also enjoy the keyless entry and start. It's nice to put the fob in your pocket and not worry about it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I admit that I JUST got this car, but I just love it. I wanted a pretty inexpensive, reliable car so I went looking for the best price on either a base model Camry, Accord, or Altima. I was surprised by how much "cheaper" the base model Honda and Toyota felt vs. the Altima. I really felt like I was getting the value I wanted, but that the car still seemed to be of a higher level than the other two. Definitely the best bang for the buck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT is fun. Love how great even the standard stereo sounds. Car is also very solid and quiet.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The sole purpose for us buying the car was dependability and gas mileage. In to months we have yet to get either. Brakes glazed in a month, they don't know why. Rotors turned now brakes act funny. Never got any better then 25 mpg on straight highway driving, sticker said 35 mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The radio has an aux plug, I guess that is cool and there is good trunk space, nice to look at.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife and I were looking for a new vehicle that got good gas mileage and had ample performance. We test drove Hondas, Toyotas and Nissans. The Altima was far and away the most fun to drive, had good gas mileage and surprising performance for a four cylinder. After over 4,500 miles including 1,000 mile trip the mpg on the road was averaging 34 and around town 27. We couldn't be happier with the car. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage, CVT and keyless operation.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So this is probably one of the best cars on the market right now, no joke. I've had it for about 4 months and the car only gets better each day. The fuel economy has become better than the EPA estmates. Maybe it's my driving or perhaps it's the area, but the car is great on fuel. The CVT is a dream and so is the handling. If there is anything it could use is a little more engine refinement and a bit less grey inside, but otherwise it is almost the perfect car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Intelligent Key system with the pushbutton start. Also, the handling, the performance, the gauges, especially the trip computer, and all the compliments I get on it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was in the market looking for a new car and my choices were, Accord, Camry and Maxima. I loved the new Accord coming from a long time Honda owner as well as the Camry. I did drive the Camry and liked it, I tried the new accord and loved it. I was about to purchase it, then I told my wife let's try the Maxima. We liked the Maxima but the salesman said just try the 2007 Altima. Wow, I was impressed, the power and all around design just caught my attention. Nissan has stepped up on this model and I recommend you drive one for yourself. I love this Altima. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is really surprising to me because I used to have a Maxima and it was nothing but a headache, not sure why but I must have picked the wrong one. Anyway this car has been great, it rides great and sound insulation is terrific. The CVT rocks I love it. I mean it's weird when you're driving a car with this power that you don't feel it shift. Still getting used to it though. I love the keyless part of this car. I never ever have to take my key out of my pocket. You can even lock and unlock the doors by pressing the button on the door. Truly keyless. Another thing is I think the seats are just fine. I don't know what some people are complaining about, they are comfortable to me. BUY IT. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT, moonroof, keyless start and keyless entry through door handle, stereo with aux port, TPMS. Convenience package, alloy wheels, and gotta love the dual exhaust.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After a Saturn and Eclipse in the 90s and SUVs and trucks over the last few years, I was unsure about moving back lower to the ground (still have our Titan, but will use it considerably less) and am delighted with the sporty feel of my new Altima. Feels solid and responsive. Very fun to drive!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the design/aerodynamics. Other sedans I tried were "nice" and "suitable", but to find a sporty looking sedan that also drives comfortably... well, we just knew the Altima was "it".</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Coming from a Nissan Sentra SE, I wanted something that was fun to drive, reliable, and technically advanced without paying for a BMW, Benz or Audi. I needed a gas saver yet something with more horses than my lawnmower. I test drove a V6 Altima then the 4. Honestly, I was amazed at how the 4 pulled out the lot and right onto a freeway on ramp. The only drawback to the 4 is the engine noise on take off however is quiets down after what used to be known as 3rd gear. I also looked at the Camry SE V6 and the Maxima. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT, true keyless entry/exit and start stop. This car is loaded with features. I got the convenience plus package that added a sunroof. I also love the TPMS. I was able to quickly point out a leaking tire. Would be helpful if it told you the cold pressure as well as which tire was low.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my Altima last April 2007 and have over 9000 miles on the car. I considered the 3.5L model, but chose the extra MPG I could get with the 2.5L. There is adequate power with the 2.5 and I have never been underpowered in any situation. The select shift component is nice when having to accelerate without pushing the gas pedal to the floor to have the engine respond. The handling is great. The Altima kept my wife out an accident last week when an elderly woman pulled out in front of her on a highway. The car continued to handle while the ABS was working. Eyewitnesses asked about the car because they couldn't believe it. Strongly suggest buying one. Get the convenience package.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride at 75 mph is quiet and I feel I have positive control of the car. The convenience package with the sunroof and leather wrapped steering wheel add to the comfort of the car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded in my Mazda6s for a 2007 Altima with the SL package. Have not regretted at all. The car drives very nicely. Unfortunately all my trips are very short. I would love to spend more time in this car. Gas mileage is good, seats are comfortable, Bose stereo is incredible. I am so happy to be back with a Nissan. The Mazda was nice but too many little problems. I used to own before that a Nissan Altima 99. What a difference. The car has finally matured into an affordable luxury car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bose Stereo, styling, push button ignition, quiet engine and rear vents. Very cold a/c. Love that Nissan has always had great a/c.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the 2.5SL package and love the leather seats and wood trim. This car balanced all my needs well: style, comfort, performance, economy and fun. My clients have felt comfortable in it. Seat was hard at first but either I or the seat adjusted (now at 5k miles). Standard radio sounds great but doesn't display artist. ABS grabby - feels like they are about to launch me through the windshield at every stop. I like all the room in the trunk, glove box, consoles and cabin. The wipers throw water back into their own way. CVT and spry engine makes it fun to drive, although it seems a little light in the front end under fast acceleration or hard braking. Feels pushed around by the wind, too. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smoothness of CVT, engine acceleration, interior and exterior styling, moonroof, keyless entry, leather seats and spacious cabin. Sound of standard radio. Good MPG but not great. Car is a lot of fun to drive, looks good and is easy to wash, too!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I test drove Altima 4 and 6 cyl, Accord V-6, Mazda3 and Mazda6 with the V6. Owned a 2001 Accord V6 and loved it, except transmission issues. I've owned 1 four cyl and swore I would only drive at least a V6. That was 10 years ago and 6 new cars ago. Why the Altima won? The CVT is amazing. I never feel like it is underpowered because of the CVT. The engine does get a little loud when merging on highways, but is silent at cruise. I can accept the 10 seconds of engine noise for V6-like acceleration. The V6 seemed too jumpy. Handles great and is fun to drive. Very quiet and full of features. If you are a driver who likes a car with lots of features and is fun to drive. Check out Altima. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CVT by far, Bose stereo and Bluetooth, keyless ignition and entry, huge glove box that's lighted when lights are on. Very well thought out storage design such as removable cup holders, console lid that slides for comfort, etc. Can roll windows down with key fob. Dual zone auto climate controls. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My wife purchased the Altima to replace her 2000 Neon. After driving everything else in its class, the Altima was her choice. The power from the 2.5L is impressive with either the 6-speed manual or CVT, and is plenty for merging in rush-hour traffic, while being smoother than most other 4-cyl cars. The interior is nicely styled and executed, with high-quality materials and excellent fit-and-finish (much better than the interior in my mothers '03 Altima). It rides and drives well, sportier than the Camry and Accord, but not as much as my Mazda6. The Convenience Plus package is well worth the price for the moonroof and alloy wheels alone. An excellent choice for a competent midsize sedan.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Intelligent Key may be a gimmick to some, but my wife likes it. Excellent gas mileage (better than the Neon), and the 20-gallon tank allows a 600+ mile range, excellent for high-mile commutes. The base stereo with single CD player is impressive. Lots of space for passengers, both front and rear. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had the '00 Maxima and bought the '07 Altima SE V6 CVT. I thought I was going to get another Maxima, but was sold after test driving the Altima. I wanted the V6 because I drive in Dallas city traffic and need the "get-up-and-go" speed from time to time. Let me just say the 270hp engine is fast, but is smooth and easy to control. You can't beat the CVT. I absolutely love the convenience of the Push Button On/Off feature. Talk about never having to fumble with your car keys again! As long as you have the key in your pocket then you can lock and unlock the car from the outside push button on the door handle. Get the '07 Altima... well worth it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Push button On and Off; CVT; 270hp; 6 CD changer and Bose stereo; built in Blue Tooth technology; Altima turning radius is much better than the Maxima; quiet; smooth; all black all leather interior; 9 cup holders; rear vents; interior lighting at night is great.</FAVORITE>
