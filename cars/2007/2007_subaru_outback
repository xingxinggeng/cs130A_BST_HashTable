<TEXT>Absolutely love this car. Bought it as a used fleet vehicle with 8k miles. Much better than my 98 Outback. Plenty of smooth power for a 4 cylinder. I can't understand why reviewers constantly dis this engine as being slow. Puts out like a small six in my opinion with plenty of low end torque. I drove a 4 cylinder Camry SE recently and can't understand what all the fuss is about. Subie is much more refined and quicker and the interior design and materials are far superior. I have driven this car in all sorts of conditions for 20K miles and reliability has been flawless. Two friends who own loaded 5 series BMWs were extremely impressed by interior design and comfort of this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Pearl white paint, beautiful leather interior, AWD, gauges and displays, heated everything, GIGANTIC moonroof, smooth, powerful and incredibly underrated 4 cylinder engine. Standard fog lights. Practical and utilitarian yet elegant demeanor.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We bought the '07 Outback Basic from my parents when we had our second child. It's been reliable and rugged, and the high ground clearance has been great for the frequently-flooded streets of Houston. It's a boring car, but can't be beat for the price! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall the car is great. I have the 3.0 L.L.Bean edition and it's very luxurious. It has plenty of power and the fuel economy is ok I get about 15 mpg in the city but I could get 21 mpg city if i drive like a granny. The sound system is pretty good. I love the XM radio and the panoramic sunroof. The main thing I don't like about it is the quality of the interior materials. The leather feels very cheap and is not very soft. The leather around the parking brake is all cracked. The plastic around the AC controls is all scratched just from fingernails turning the dials. The factory Nav is useless! It gives you wrong directions and it always tells you to turn if there is just a curve in the road.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the XM radio, dual climate control, mp3/ Wma player, trip computer, panoramic sunroof, homelink, I like how the Awd uses the rear wheels to drive the vehicle when the road is dry for better performance and all four wheels to drive the vehicle when the conditions are bad.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned four Subaru's. The quality of each successive Subaru has declined. Recently, I discovered that the Outback eats rear tires - $1000 worth of (80K) tires in 35K miles. After taking it to a dealer, I got the sales pitch answer, "We're a small dealership, but we are unaware of a problem". So I proceeded to Les Schab. They told me that they aware of four other Subaru's with the same problem. Also, the problem is well documented on the internet. I'm a licensed mechanical engineer and I've owned my last Subaru as I've lost trust in Subaru as a company. I can understand design problems - but not acknowledging the problem and taking responsibility for it is unacceptable. </TEXT>

<TEXT>My 2007 Subaru Outback is not a power vehicle, but it has enough power to take off if need be. The all wheel drive is great off-road and in the snow with the ride in both areas as calm as can be expected. I love having the wagon space when I need it, though I have run into times when I can't fit what I would like because the car is too short or not wide enough with the wheel wells. Gas mileage is right at 26 mph no matter how I drive. Freeway trip mileage is around 28.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My last vehicle was a Hyundai suv in which I had no problems with, but being an outside sales rep. I needed a car with better safety features and better gas mileage and I found it with the Subaru outback. I feel very safe in this car it handles the road in all kinds of bad weather especially the snow! This is the 1st cat that I did not have to put snow tires on. I tinted the windows on the rear and back to make the car look a little sharper and allows more privacy I would definitely purchase another Subaru product! </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first Subaru. I can't report on reliability yet but I think the car is much undervalued (Audi, Volvo?). I actually left the US and brought it with me to Europe (it costs about double here!); drove it across the continent during winter, pulls you nicely out of snow, handles well on the dry road (although certainly not like a BMW), okay mileage but rather poor at high freeway speeds (I guess it's the AWD, ground clearance and relatively big size, btw, backseats down and the cargo sleeps 2 people v. comfy), feels friendly, safe, uncomplicated yet sufficiently equipped, practical and robust, non-flashy and well respected. Maintenance + engine compartment will be the next frontier.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like, of course, the AWD-wagon combination and versatility (you're driving a car not a truck!) the cargo space, the easy cruise control, the friendly, balanced interior, the safety features and feel that you can go anywhere anytime with this car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Outback. Sold first one, a 2000, in '07 with 175 thousand miles bought this. Very reliable, as was the 2000. The driver power seat's been improved, (2000 was poor) altho still could offer more positioning. Standard 2.5 has a little more power, which is nice and it still gets about the same mileage. Car's heavy on safety, which appeals to some. Wish they'd concentrate more on performance and mileage. That said it's not bad in the latter two. I think safety issues are better addressed more by skillful driving. They eliminated the weather radio band which I think was a mistake, I used it a lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had my Outback for 20 months. Absolutely no problems. It's seen the dealership for oil changes and tire rotations only. I'd highly recommend a Subaru to anyone shopping. Very reliable and dependable. This is my sixth Subaru and would be hardpressed not to buy another in the future. BTW, I like the grille on the '07 better than the ones on the '08 models. </TEXT>

<TEXT>There are few limitations of this vehicle. During the first 6 months of ownership the AWD with it's amazing cornering has got me out of 2 very tight situations where I was cut off by vehicles doing 40 mph less than myself (I wasn't speeding, they pulled out). About the only thing I dont like is the leather heated seats. They are cold up north and the heated area is a little narrow. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Had a '97 Outback and moved up to this because of the power and safety factors. Fabulous ride, much quieter than the '97 and does everything the old one did but better. The turbo is fantasic, fun and a wonderful enhancement. Mileage averages around 24.4 hwy/city, which I consider not bad for the fun derived. Had it 1 year now and love it! Terrific on snow and ice, and takes mountain passes here in Colorado with ease. Highly recommend to anyone, regardless of normal road conditions in their area. Would not get GPS again, my handheld Garmin is better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Between myself and my wife we have had 5 Subaru outbacks, two of which have been LLBean editions, and three had leather interior. This car carries me alone and I have had the drivers seat cover replaced 3 times so far and coming up on 4, because of abrasions in the leather surface. Subaru has replaced the seat hardware supposedly and adjusted the frame, nothing seems to correct this problem so far. My only deduction is that since my last LLBean in 2002, the seat material quality has declined. Subaru does not indicate to me that they have any major issue with the leather seating.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in a 2001 LL Bean Outback. Was very impressed with the overall design, roominess, and comfort level. Also looked at Honda CRVs. There is no comparison value wise. The Subaru comes with many features that the Honda lacks, ie: power driver's seat. My concern about power in the mountains was a non-issue when using the sport shifter. Gas mileage is 27-28 on regular gas.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall, I like the car. Mileage has been just under 27 MPG mixed driving on 3 tanks. I gave up a 1990 Volvo 240 wagon for this and I do miss the Volvo. Seating position and visibility were better in the Volvo. Performance is adequate, especially for the naturally aspirated 4-cyl. Considering the all wheel drive and ground clearance, the mileage is pretty good. Hopefully it will improve with break-in. I liked the looks of the 2007 grille much better than the new '08, so I grabbed it while I could. Haven't had it long enough to really rate reliability, so it gets an 8 rating there.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Subaru Outback LL Bean 3.0 edition after driving every possible AWD sports sedan on the planet. I traded in my 3 season luxury vehicle (2005 Cadillac CTS) for a 4 season AWD Subaru that is a safe, fun, practical and luxurious sedan. The Caddy was absolutely terrible in the snow. I drove the AWD BMW, the Audi A6, the Infiniti G35X and then I tried the Subaru LL Bean. It has all the right features with an engine that is silky smooth. I am very pleased.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this to replace the Impreza WRX because I needed the extra cargo space. I have not been disappointed. The fuel economy is reasonable. I have a little over 4000 miles on it and get about 26 MPG for every day driving and it takes regular fuel instead of premium which saves some money. I fill up about evert 330 miles. Drives through snow very well. I drove through 8 inches of wet snow with no issue. </TEXT>

<TEXT>If you are in the market for an AWD vehicle do yourself a favor and look no further. I spent a LOT of time, looked at the likes of the CRV, RAV4, 4Runner, Audi, Infinity and FX35. Bang for the buck the Outback is the best deal in town. I have the L.L.Bean with the 6 cyl. engine and all options, heated, leather, etc. What you get is a vastly superior AWD technology compared to most competitors, good MPG, and a solidly built car that can take your family anywhere for about $28k.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded an Audi A6 Quattro for my outback. The Outback costs 1/3 less than the Audi to replace. The Outback is virtually the same vehicle. I lost heated rear seats and the ride is more stiff. The first day I owned the car I drove in a 8" snow storm and the car handled every bit as well as the Quattro. I have owned 3 Audi's and I am a convert. This is a tremendous car for the money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a nice little car that is designed perfectly for those who live an active life. It hauls skis, hiking equipment, bicycles, etc. very efficiently. The Outback 2.5i drives smoothly on the highway while getting 23-26 mpg (actual mpg with 5-speed manual). If you put four snows on it, the car will go through snow just as if it were on dry pavement. We have driven it through 10 inches with no problems. Snow stability is great and braking is good with the right winter tires. Overall, the car is perfect for our active family. The major problem with the car is the California emissions. Buy your car outside of New England to avoid bucking and surging on the highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded in an 01 Outback wagon for a sedan for my wife. Kid's in college, time for a fun car. This thing handles! The "small" engine is 175HP and it has some legs. During the test drive I took a 90 degree turn on a back narrow road at 30 mph. ABS kicked in for second then hit the gas and she never missed a beat. The car is fun to drive (not that my wife has let me get my hands on it since the test drive). Sharp looking too. Inside nice with leather, moon roof, 6 CD player, and many other features. I think the taupe leather is going to be tough to keep clean but other then that, we are happy. This is the last year for the sedan, grab one while you can.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought our 2.5i wagon a month ago. Good value for the money but I have stumbled upon an existing problem which is apparently being kept quiet. We live in Colorado, and our brand new Subaru starts slowly in cold temps and barely started when we have gone into the mountains (9000+ feet of altitude). This seems to be a common problem around here, though I haven't read of it anywhere. The programming parameters for the car's electronics somehow don't properly take into account the effect of altitude. Mountain owners (say the dealer) have trouble starting Outbacks all the time. Called Subaru of America and was assigned a case number. This should have been fixed years ago. New battery had no effect.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our family has had at least one Subaru in our fleet for more than a decade. The 2007 basic Outback features a nice combination of performance, comfort,and versatility. The fact that Subarus feature AWD, solid reliability, and good resale value keep us coming back. Subaru also partners with Chase Bank to bring you a Subaru credit card that makes purchasing and maintaining your Subaru less financially burdensome. Subaru continues to move forward with quality and design improvements. I wouldn't say the 07 Outback deserves to be called "luxurious", but it is not far deserving that moniker. Price of this car goes up quickly with the addition of creature comforts. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car, symmetrical all wheel drive is a must for winter driving. The center console is simple and easy to use. Sound system is good (although I'll be purchasing subwoofers soon.) It's definitely a car you will get your money's worth out of. So far I've been averaging 19.6 mpg in the city. The 17in. rims, independent suspension, and 8.4 inches or ground clearance is a definite plus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I previously owned a 98 Forester and a 2001 Outback so I chose to come back to Subaru mainly for the AWD system. I know gas mileage will improve over the first 5000 kilometers, and with warmer temperatures in the spring. Since buying the Outback I've added a tape/film chip guard from Ziebart to help reduce gravel rash on the hood, the arm rest extension, winter mats, and had a dark tint film added to the front part of the sunroof to reduce glare when driving. The build quality appears far better than my earlier purchases, and the fold down feature for the back seat is much more user friendly.The interior materials seem to be of a higher quality with no issues around fit or finish.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very good all around visibility. Good headlights, and a good sweep area on the front and rear wipers. The lighting on the gauges and controls makes them very visible at night. As a Subaru the AWD is a given, and the functionality of having a wagon again makes this a very practical family vehicle. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had a contract with Jeep to build a Compass with a M6 but they are holding production of manual transmissions, so I went with the Subaru. This turns out to be a wiser deal. The interior is much nicer and the overall quality of the Subaru is much better. I love the feel of running through the gears although I wish I could run first a little higher although it is beneficial to have a LOW gear for starting on hills. I still have a Jeep Liberty (wife's) and this is my first venture into a foreign (Ohio) car. I really have to say I am pleased with all that comes standard on this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned a 2003 Forester until it was totaled in an accident. The safety design of the car was a selling point and paid off. I never had any problems with the car and don't expect any from my new Outback. The Basic comes loaded, so a higher version just buys luxury items. I think Subaru is trying to compete with the Audi and Volvo AWD sports sedans/wagons. I did not drive them, but the Outback Basic in comparison is a good value. Edmunds true cost to own statistics is a good tool. Even though it doesn't have the lowest total cost, a low purchase price and using Subaru rewards brings the cost down. Two months driving and no problems except the lift gate rattled over bumps. Dealer fixed it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third Outback and this is a quantum leap over my 2001. Smooth, strong acceleration, great sport shift, good mileage, 20-22 mpg in town. Beautiful interior and paint. Love the firm but compliant suspension. New sunroof is big and now opens all the way. Looked at Lexus, Acura, Infiniti. Subaru beat them in all categories above, and about $8,000 dollars less. Do not exceed 4000 rpm for the first 1000 miles and use the accelerator sparingly and you will not be disappointed. After that, let her rip. I also own a pristine 2001 BMW 530 w/SP.

<TEXT>I wanted something that was fun to drive, tow my boat and get decent mileage. This was the perfect vehicle. I can get high twenties on the highway, tows my boat, offers the choice of a 5 speed manual (autos are for wimps), has a tremendous list of safety and comfort features, all wheel drive, and tremendous amounts of power for a family wagon. If you want to combine driving fun with economy, utility and safety, nothing in the price range comes close. In city traffic, the turbo is a blast. I have a sports car I put in storage when MN winter weather hits; this car will allow me to not miss it so much during the cold months. It's a blast.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted Subaru for some time, finally I have it. Previously VW Golf' 99, Isuzu Rodeo '99 2WD. Must say it is a nice vehicle, fun to drive. I go to Tahoe a bit. If you want to enjoy the car take it on curvy road. It averages 30m/g on hwy. The 2.5i has good power, however another 25 HP would be nice! It lacks get up and go power, do not count on any fast take offs. It pulls nicely up the hill once you get it going. Some wind noise is present. Taking the roof cross bars down might reduce it. The beige cloths seats get dirty very quickly, go with the leather. Some rattling in the cargo area drives me crazy, can't find it. Other than that you are getting a lot for your money. I hope to enjoy it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>-AWD -sturdy roof rack -fog lights, great illumination of the road. Over all it is a great car but needs some improvements, Signal/wiper stick 25 year old design -looks -old fashion volume knob on stereo -heated seats -gas consumption -nice performance on curvy roads -all around good deal.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our 4th Subaru since 1990. This one is the best so far. Style, fit and finish are superb. The stereo with XM radio is outstanding. Wonderful sound system. Handling is great and I love the 3 position switch controlling turbo performance. In the conservative 'Intelligent' mode we get 24+ MPG and the engine has yet to be broken in. Change the switch setting to super high performance and expect to get a real thrill (but plan to pay for it in MPG's). Turning radius is very short and without a doubt the ride beats any Mercedes or Lexus I've ever ridden in. Heated seats respond quickly and will roast your back side when set to high. We have the nav system, but yet to test it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Like the styling, fit & finish, quiet ride, stereo, interior luxury and turbo performance. Really LOVE the ride! AWD is fantastic. Drove it in 16 inch deep wet snow and it never flinched. Mileage seems acceptable and will likely improve as engine breaks in. Have yet to find any flaws.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We went to the dealer expecting to buy the 2007 LL Bean. I was disappointed with the automatic tranny. Test drove the XT turbo w/ manual shifter and fell in love with it, as did my wife. As ski instructors in Western Colorado with a 50 mile round trip commute, we need a car that works in snow. With VDC, traction control, and snow tires this car will be unstoppable. BTW, Edmund's does not show that this car comes standard with traction control, but it does. With the SI selected to Sport#, this car runs neck and neck with our '02 WRX. Corners like it too. Heated power leather seats, dual zone auto climate control, and quiet ride give this car a lot of upscale standard features. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>VDC, traction control, and good ground clearance. Airbags everywhere. Gobs of power with decent fuel economy if you watch your right foot. Big knobs and easy to read radio and climate control system. Taupe leather adds classy touch. Much quieter than our WRX. Surprisingly good looking design.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Having just come off a 9 year love affair with an '85 Caprice Wagon I was looking for something to fill the void. The Outback, while quite a bit smaller, fit the bill. This car handles like a dream. It is responsive and it sticks to the road. I also traded in a '95 Impala for the '07 Outback. I lost some HP but the Outback outperforms on every other level. The apparent lack of unlocking the hatchback from inside without unlocking all doors is semi-annoying. I bought the subwoofer add on and it adds a lot to the sound system. I can't believe how much FUN driving this car can be.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded my Grand Cherokee for this. Much better driver, obviously. Power is similar but handling is a world better. 20 MPG on the first tank - about equal city, highway driving in the DC area. Expect that to improve a bit. Takes a while for turbo to kick in, but I had been driving in 'Intelligent' mode a lot. After a weekend trip into the western PA mountains, my mileage seems to be improving. The seats were comfortable and the ride was great - hwy and city. I usually stop at least once on the 3 hour ride, but didn't feel the need to. Switched to Sport mode for most driving and have been enjoying the Sportshift manual. Also shopped BMW 328xi, Audi,Volvo,Saab. BMW came close, but too much $$.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable seating. Great handling. Good power. Awesome moonroof. Plenty of room to haul cargo - don't notice a difference from the size of my Jeep. Glad I waited till this year to get SI-Drive, VDC, iPod audio jack. Best deal for the dough.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I ordered this car with extra features installed at the port and picked it up with 4 miles on it last week on October 12th. This is my sixth Subaru and it is the best in interior finish and outside finish of the past Subarus I have owned. So far I find it to drive very smoothly and the road noise has diminished from the past Subarus I have owned. If it is like the past five Subarus I have owned I will be very satisfied with it as I have never had any problems with any of them. I find the fit, finish and mechanical portions of the car very good. I do find the rear leg room lacking when the front seats are pushed all the way back but I hear they are going to lengthen the Outback in 2009. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the climate control and the MP3/iPod jack & WOW surround sound as standard features. Also new for 2007 is standard windshield wiper heaters and all wear items are under the three year/36000 mile warranty. The car is a great value when you compare it with the Audi A-6, Passat, & Volvo XC-7</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought it a month ago. Very nice car. Drives very well, 175 hp four is more than adequate. Got about 22 MPG on mixed driving. Rear seats are tight ? I am 6?1? and do not have enough leg room. Front seats are too narrow ? my 97 Camry?s seats are 2? wider. Right front seat is too low. I'd also like more storage areas; with two cups in front cup holders and glasses in the dash compartment I do not have a place for my cell phone. If front belt is unbuckled tones do not shut up ? that is the most annoying feature in this car! I have to buckle up moving the car on driveway or a parking lot. Overall ? great vehicle, very reliable per CR, looks & runs great, 4 wheel drive is a plus.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this to replace a Forester - 500 miles so far and I love it. Great lines, nice cockpit feel, handling is excellent. Very well equipped for a base model, including AWD and all Subaru's standard safety features. 2007 base model dropped in price from last year due to them removing alloys, electric driver seat, rear cargo area cover...I don't need that, I'd rather save $1500.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Had the base Outback about a month, so far it is a good car. The rear hatch started rattling after only 600 miles took it back to the dealer who fixed it. Compared to other brands this one seems pretty solid. I like the ride, it has plenty of hp, mileage is average just under 28. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased the vehicle this weekend. The ride is ultra smooth. The electric seat adjuster on the driver's side is great. This car is a good choice for both the young and old! The interior is both stylish and functional. Just the right amount of gadgets for me, not too many to overwhelm the driver. The power panoramic sunroof is awesome. I will enjoy this S.U.W. for years to come!</TEXT>

<TEXT>3 guys I knew swore by their Outbacks. Was looking for a new car and test drove the Limited wagon. Leather is nice. Definitely the best car I have ever bought. Perfect size for hauling people yet small and nimble for zipping in Atlanta traffic. All the features on the Limited are worth the extra price. I love it. I'm a normal sized guy and the seats fit me like a glove. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm always hesitant when a model says "basic", however the basic outback is far from that, with so many standard features. For the price this may be may best vehicle purchase ever. The only addition to ours is Auto transmission, floor mats, and cargo tray. The gas mileage is better than advertised, so far I'm getting better than 24 mpg city. The Outback rides nice and sits firmly on the road, the interior is plenty spacious and very comfortable. We live in the Rockies and spend significant time driving in snow/wet roads, so an AWD vehicle was a must...Subaru has the best! I would buy another in a minute.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My 72 year old Mom decided it was time to trade in her 1990 Mercedes 300E for a new Mercedes. We looked at both the new Mercedes "C" and "E" models and we were NOT impressed. Looked at Cadillac and Lincoln, just not right. Took her to the Subaru dealer, she got in the Outback, shut the door and her eyes twinkled and said this is "IT". The only thing bad was the dealer offered her almost nothing for her Mercedes that only had 80K miles in garage kept perfect condition. But maybe that was good, because I told her I would buy it for that much, and later that day she said I could have it as a gift for helping her select her new Subaru - AKA Miss Suzy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I really don't know what is basic about my BASIC WAGON because it's got all I need and more. This 2007 is a great deal. So far, with routine driving I am getting a solid 24 MPG! I am 5-9" with plenty of room for me and my family of 4. Easy hook-ups for my 2 year old's carseat, and my 15 year old daughter loves it, even though it a wagon. I am so happy with this buy. Safe, fun, loaded by my standards. I have the auto and love that sport shift for the curves. Good stereo for a basic feature too. It's early in the game, but I really think this car is a GREAT deal for the money. With rebate I paid $21,787. The steel 16" wheels are fine by me. Car feels and runs solid like my Toyota always did!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering wheel, dash layout & color, ride, roadster doors, handling, MPG, looks, safety, price, comfortable ride. I can't wait for SNOW. I drive in WV up and down hills all day. Fog lamps. 175 HP is plenty enough for me and my family. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>For the price, I hoped for more up to date features. The GPS is outdated, with less up to date info than my Garmin purchased a year prior. Car accelerates with hesitation at first, and then kicks in. Rear brake light was dislodged when first purchased, and needed to be put back in place. Stereo features are well integrated with iPod adapter, but no Bluetooth on this vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the true SUV, especially the "Utility" aspect, since it conforms to nearly all my needs. Also, there's great value here in all its added creature comforts and the great reputation for safety. In city driving, it's peppy and its short turning radius is great for parking. On interstate drives it is wonderfully comfortable for me and an 85 lb collie. On the sport side, it can transport up to three sea-kayaks comfortably and cross-country skis can fit inside (over the front seat median). I do give up some things like having to slowing down on the curves, overall gas mileage (21) can be better and telescoping steer wheel and memory seats would be nice, but, overall, it's a winner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for all of 24hrs and LOVE IT! It's a basic 2007 Outback wagon with manual trans. It's only got 80 miles on it for the drive home. Drive home is a curvy road with lots of hilly areas. Handles awesome and climbs the hills like they're not there. Bought it to replace my 2000 Legacy wagon with nearly 100,000 miles on it. I highly recommend this car!</TEXT>
