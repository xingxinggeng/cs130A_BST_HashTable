<TEXT> Let me start off bye saying the car drives pretty good. But thats about as far as it goes. My 2.0S only gets 23 mpg combined city and highway driving. Which is way below the fueleconomy.gov ratings of 25mpg city and 33mpg highway. What has happened to nissan. I like the car ok other than that but to me gas mileage is a big part of car ownership. I would strongly advise anyone considering buying a 2007 Sentra to buy a honda civic or toyota corolla. They get way better gas mileage. I only got 350 miles on a 14.5 gallon tank of gas. I'm very disappointed and nissan should be ashamed of the gas mileage on the sentra. I will never buy another NISSAN again. Hope that helps.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is one of the best cars I've owned, owned a lot. The exterior design, and color (tent green) I know... The orange leather interior first concerned me but now like it a lot. Ive had a lot of lookers at this car, great gas mileage, bigger car for the mileage, 28-35. I drive almost 150 miles a day and its very comfortable and easy on the gas. Id recommend, and have, this car in a heart beat. Never a mechanical problem. Just rotate the tires every 5000 miles and change oil at the same time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Leased it new and returned it to the dealer with 20K. No mechanical problems in 2 years. Interior build was fine (except one drawer that never fit right and a dead electric outlet). Exterior build was good and the finish stood up to a scratchy bush that's too close to our driveway. Biggest complaint was performance - car was underpowered when accelerating, and I had to floor the gas to pass on the highway. As a result, MPG was poor, never topping 23 (50% city driving). I also HATED the CVT - braking was jerky despite steady pressure on the pedal. My mother actually refused to drive the car because of the CVT/brakes. After 2 years in a 2005 Altima, driving this car was definitely a letdown.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I LOVED all the toys in this car, especially the Bluetooth and keyless ignition - no digging in my purse for cell phone or keys! The Rockford stereo system was excellent and I loved the 6 CD changer. When this car wasn't moving, it was easily the most comfortable and "fun" car I've ever owned.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car new and so far I've only a couple of complaints. One is the hotspot on the shifter assembly. Turn the lights on and your leg will feel the heat. The other is the front brakes are horrible. I fixed this problem from the get go by ordering new rotors from ebay (I know... I know.) and using a high quality pad from autozone. To those with the tire sensor problem, make sure to check the spare tire also. I've NEVER had my light come on for anything other than low pressure or one flat. I use this as a family car, and it does it's job VERY well. Plenty.. and I mean PLENTY of space for almost anything you could need. Mileage is great also! Nissan loves to make a torquey engine!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Blue tooth. CVT. High viewing position compared to other vehicles. Very comfortable. Especially so on the long haul. Average CITY MPG's are 25-26 and Interstate is 30-34.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought a 2007 Nissan. I have 53,000 miles on it as I do alot of driving. At about 46,000, I was on a long trip about 6 hours into my travel my RPM's began to fluctuate, power was lost could not go over 20mpg. I pulled over on I-10 near lordsburg. After 20 minutes car started up and made it to Ca. I took car to dealership and was told nothing was wrong. Once again at 53,000 I was driving to Ca. again and once again about 6 hours later same thing happened. This time tranny blew. Fluid was all over. Towed to Tucson, covered under extended warranty. Before this everything on car seem to work. Does a tranny usually go out this quick? </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was in need of a car and didnt put much thought into what I wanted. But what a good choice I made. I do mostly highway driving and get about 400 miles to the tank. I like the shifter being elevated. It is not a family car nor made for tall people. I am neither. The exterior is sharp. I work for a highline dealership and all my techs suggested this model. It's only been a few months but with Nissan's reputation I do not expect any major issues. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my car in 2007 and I love it. I am a true fan of Honda, but I am so glad I chose my Nissan Sentra over the Honda Civic, but my girlfriend will get the '09 civic. I chose my car for reliability and horsepower. This car is great for long distance driving and In-city driving. Honda(s) usually sits low, also many are complaining about a rattling noise on some of the Honda (s). I have a 94 Toyota Corolla 5speed and it is great on gas, so I look at the Nissan like it could burn gas a little slower. I get 45mpg in my Corolla because it is a 1.6L. My Nissan is a 2.0L, but it is better in the city. The Nissan Sentra is a great car to drive overall.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Exterior Shape. It is so cute. The Interior is ok, but it is nice also. The car is very comfortable for the driver to see the road in front of him. My favorite have to be the overall look from the outside because it is classy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my 2007 Sentra S for almost two years now. I am kind of surprised by some of the negative reviews I've read here since this car has been a peach for me. I agree with the dings on the plastic interior, non- collapsing rear view mirrors and blind spots, but I've adapted and overcome these shortcomings. I'm not understanding the mileage knocks as I get out what I put in with this car. If I am driving like a madman in the city I can get like 19 mpg. If I mellow out a bit it will go up to about 27. The worst I have ever done in freeway driving is 28. Driving conscientiously I get 34. My overall averages, mostly freeway with 15% city driving is 31-32 mpg. I am happy with that. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>On board computer, sound system that works for me, mileage, performance that is surprising for a little car, positive comments I get on the car, inside and out, completely reliable at nearly two years, no issues, great driving in the snow, comfortable over long distances, feels like a nicer ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd Sentra. Enjoyed my 06 so much, I traded it on the 07 Showroom model, when I went in for a oil change. New exterior and the CVT out of this world. I have more power & pickup than some vehicles with V6. The Bluetooth, is the best. I don't have to operate my cell phone...I let my car do it, by a push the button on the steering wheel. I have all the bells & whistles and feel like I drive & own a luxury car with all the economy and pep too. The tire sensor is touchy, but if you adjust the pressure for the weather and drive 40mph for a mile, it will go off. The battery went dead at 16 mths and dealership couldn't find the reason. Cost me $55 to replace it.(warranty)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the Bluetooth, the CVT pep and speed. The hidden trunk compartment is great for my purse if needed. Great gas mileage.....</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased this car for my wife and after only 1000 miles have been avg 33 mpg. Great space & comfort! Not a sports sedan, but wasn't looking for one. Nissan unfortunately goes for cheap tires which I will shortly change. Wheels could have a better design. The CVT makes a bit of unusual sound, but gets the job done. Rear suspension should have been of the independent variety as well, but I guess costs have to be cut somewhere. I would recommend the Sentra as a great commuter car and she's quiet and could go all day at that speed without any stress to car or driver. I would recommend giving this car a test drive!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I must say this car outperformed even what I expected. I too was deciding between the Honda Civic and Nissan Sentra. The Sentra seemed more economical and gave me better bang for the buck. Anyway, this car has been giving me amazing gas mileage. I have been getting well over 38 mpg highway (averaging more around 40!). The design is very nice for the car. As mentioned by others GET THE CONVENIENCE PACKAGE, it is worth every penny. Overall, this was a great decision on my part as my first ever new car purchase. The handling, design, functionality, and versatility of this car far surpassed what even I could have expected. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the SE-R Spec V over the 2.0 due to the performance and interior styling of the car. Unlike the base model Sentra, it has ABS, remote entry, height adjustable seats, and who can complain about the 200 horsepower stock coming from the QR25DE. Not to mention 26 MPG city and 33 highway. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my 2007 Sentra 2.0 with 6 speed trans, last week. I spent a lot of time deciding between the Sentra and the Civic. I went with the Sentra because the price was right, I needed a commuter car and didnt want to spend a lot. For the price tag, you do get quite a bit. However, this is a very base model car except for power windows, locks, and AC. I am 6'3" and have had terrible pains in my right leg from driving this car, unfortunately the seat does not go far back enough, and is not height adjustable. For that reason, I may be selling my Sentra in the near future. Otherwise, its a peppy, fun car to drive that doesn't cost a whole lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The cars ok. It's too bad the cvt does not save as much gas as advertised. I only get 25-28 per gallon. The only good thing is the tech package, Bluetooth keyless stuff, etc. Other than that, the engine's crying with high RPM which takes most of the gas.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the Sentra for about a month now and I absolutely love it! The car drives so smooth and quiet and the gas mileage averages about 28 with stop and go city traffic, but I expect that to improve b/c the car is still so new. The car is surprisingly large inside and the seats are very comfy. Compared to the other cars in its class you get a lot more style and features for your money. The base civic and mazda3 don't even have power windows/doorlocks or AC! Definitely no regrets here!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car for just over three months now. My miles per gallon is steadily increasing but I'm still not satisfied that it's anywhere near the EPA estimate. I understand that isn't a perfect number, but it seems unattainable especially considering most of my miles are highway. The design of the car is great. I get compliments constantly. The noise levels in the cabin are average. Nice weather is just arriving so I'll know more about the windows and sunroof soon. Ride quality is very comfortable and the steering is responsive. The engine has enough get up and go to survive city and highway alike. Rockford Fosgate Audio is stellar and I love the intelligent key.</TEXT>

<TEXT>...if only the one I bought was problem-free. In the 5 weeks that I've owned the car I've had problem with a bad Airbag Clockspring (makes ticking noise in steering wheel), front brakes pulsating (rotors resurfaced), Corrosion on the chrome molding on grill/nissan emblem, and finally some strange foam insulation piece came up with the window today when I rolled it down and them back up. Nice huh??? Oh, and the parts aren't yet available to fix these issues..nor are the body side moldings and fog lights that I purchased with the car. Be very careful with the car, as I have been told that all of the parts being made are going to the new cars and aren't available yet for any other purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It is a great little car, roomy for its class, good mileage, fun to drive. The BlueTooth and Intelligent Key - How did we do without them, before we had them. They are great functions and work as intended. It is one of the most enjoyable cars we have had. We test drove many in its class, but the Sentra stood out on its own. The Dealer did not sell this car. The car sold itself. We test drove several Sentras and Versas, and had a difficult time selecting. The Sentra won out for value for the dollar and the extra interior room made the final decision easy. A quality car in its class. Wish I had two of them. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Generally speaking I like this vehicle. PROS: good looking, deceivingly spacious, I like the interior placement of the controls; seating is quite comfortable; fairly quiet in smooth driving situations. My kids love it. It's really rather adorable. CONS: The shape of the side mirrors cause problems with the blind spot; I don't feel it "grips" the road as well as I'd like it to- suspension feels a bit mushy; I don't like how wide the material is leading from the top of the window into the end of the windshield again causes trouble with visibility. I don't understand why the door controls don't light up? Lastly, the rear headrests obscure visibility.Overall cuter than the rest in its class.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have just purchased this Sentra SL and I just love it. My previous car was a V6 so I was a little concerned (actually a lot concerned) about going to a 4 cylinder. I was so surprised on the pick up of this car. The car is so quiet that I keep thinking the car has died at the traffic lights. The handling is great, the features are incredible for this price range and would recommend this car to anyone young or old. My teenager loves it she says this is going to be her first car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car in Nov. 2006. The handling is excellent. The engine is quick and for a 4-cylinder it has great pick-up. The CVT engine I think is a load of garbage though -- I can feel almost every shift. Also, the car does not handle well at all with bumps, which is very annoying. My paint could be defective, but if a leaf touches the car there is a small scratch left behind. The car is roomy and very comfortable. The body style is comparable to the Maxima, which was a huge selling point for me since I came out of a 93 Max -it does not come close to its power though. I fill up at least three times per month, so it is not that bad on gas. This car is great in the snow! It is a tank! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the Car. Went from Pathfinder to this. Had always been a nissan fan. My instinct about "nissan is more value for the money when compared with similarly priced cars in its class" still holds true. Who would give bluetooth, leather in this class/price. Honda's may have the best resale value. But I bought the car for my needs, not thinking about how much I would get 5 years down the road. MPG: So far, with 200 miles(city) on it the trip computer says 26.5. Considering where I came from (17 mpg), I will be happy if it gives 30+. Ride : Excellent. Drove 4 people at 85mph comfortably. Interior: Luxurious. Features : Rich.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove up from Las Vegas to South East Washington to buy this Car (I saved 2k doing so). I was some what worried because I didn't have the ABS pkg. and there were icy conditions. Well on the way back my buddy who had bought a pre-owned 4x4 truck got hit buy a gust of wind, lost traction and rolled it. 4 of us were now in 1 car. We had some icy roads all the way down into central Nevada but by brand new Sentra handled like champ! I did a lot (I mean obsessive amounts) of research on cars in this class and price range. I was going to get a used Honda Civic but when given the opportunity to get a Brand New Sentra I jump on it. Honda and Toyota make you pay for all the nice stuff.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1) The Interior and Storage Space came in handy driving 4 grown men cross- country 2) The Drive-Tran with its 140 HP, 145 Torque and CVT, translating into muscle at city speeds and good gas mileage at high way speeds gives you Family value and a fun drive 3) The hopefully never seen 6 std.

<TEXT>I've had my Sentra for three weeks and have already put 1,500 miles on it. What a car! Its fuel efficiency overdelivers, if anything. I got 42 all the way to work today. It tends to perform best fuel-wise when you're going about 50-55 mph. I got the souped up version: sunroof, saddle colored leather seats, convenience package with bluetooth, trunk divider, CVT, etc. It's a pleasure to drive. I had a Saab 9-3 that was 7 year old and just completely falling apart with just 85,000 miles on it. I didn't even think I'd be interested in a Sentra - went in to look at the hybrid Altima. But this car gets BETTER mileage than that hybrid, so what's the point? Buy a Sentra!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather seats, bluetooth, sunroof, leather st. wheel, winter handling, CVT, trunk divider, interior lights that illuminate the floor and storage areas, styling is HOT - really turning heads - ride is SMOOTH, fuel economy is EXCELLENT, seats are comfortable, iPod jack, intelligent key is great.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When shopping for a car I found this to be the best out the other comparable cars I looked at (corolla, honda fit, versa). However, since I've had the car I have discovered some things that I find almost uncomfortable. This car definitely looks nicer & feels better then the others I mentioned. But the seats, the handling and the steering I'm having a hard time getting used to.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I think this car looks nicer than others in it's category. I like the cup holders in the backseat & that both seats go down.

<TEXT>The car is good, and just comes up short on a couple things. I would have liked the Sentra to have the same push-button as the Altima. Also, it doesn't have daytime running lights, which is a standard feature in Canada. Hmm... anyway, the CVT is nice, but not for those who crave performance. The bluetooth works well, and I hate plastic rims, so the 16" aluminum-alloy option is a must. The Rockford system is nice, but my rear-plastic rattles a little, nothing a little dynamite won't fix though. Don't read too much into my complaints, overall I'm happy with my new Sentra and I expect there to be some shortcomings in a value-priced car. Look at the SE-R for some more power.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for over a month and I am very disappointed with it. The car does not come near the estimated gas mileage. I am getting 27 mpg in the city as an average and only 26 to 27 mpg on the highway. I would have expected closer to 32 on the highway. The car does not take bumpy roads very well. The suspension seems to be stiff.When the temperature outside is below freezing and the car is cold the transmission will not shift down until it warms up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted to buy an affordable car with good looks, comfort and decent gas mileage. I have been searching the web for 4 months. This is the one I have been waiting for. I purchased the 2.0 model with manual transmission. I wanted a Camry at first, but some reviews for the 6-speed were negative and the sticker price was about $3000 more. This car handles great, it's peppy 2.0 engine is amazing. It is a lot of fun to drive. The interior cabin is designed nicely and has much more room than I expected, even the trunk is roomy and the back seat folds down for extra access through the trunk for longer items. The sticker price was reasonable for the amount of standard features in this car</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2007 Nissan Sentra falls short in comfort and price when compared to its rivals like the toyota corolla, hyundai elantra, mazda3, and honda civic. Options like side door moldings, fog lights, and lighted console mirror, keyless entry are extras when most of these features are standard on other vehicles. The engine is noisy and the steering offers no flexibility in making wide turns. For a smoother ride and more accessories the smarter choice is the 2.0S or 2.0SL.</TEXT>

<TEXT>OK, it's still not the flashiest thing on the highway, but what a GREAT car for the money! The Sentra is so smooth (love that CVT) and quiet (much quieter than the Civic or Mazda 3) and has so many cool features (choose the convenience package for sure) that it is very hard to beat. (Warning: it is easy to exceed the speed limit without knowing it - that's how smooth and quiet it is.) The interior is very comfortable and above average in looks - controls are well placed and uncomplicated. In the first month of driving the car is getting 33.6 miles per gallon, not bad, and I expect it to get a little better as the car is broken in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I wanted to get a fuel efficient vehicle before the gas prices shoot up again, which will probably be in 2007. Before I actually purchased my Sentra, I looked at all the competitive models including the Corolla. The Sentra offers far more features than any of the other cars and is still in the same price range. My gas mileage is 26.6 in the city 37.1 freeway. It is easy to park and fun to drive. And having to live and commute in California, that says a lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got my new Sentra, but it's my first new car ever, so my opinion may be biased in that it's such a giant improvement over the last car I was driving. Although that was a Nissan as well & was still going strong with 186,000 miles on it. I love the new Sentra, much roomier than previous generations. The trunk is huge & the 60/40 is great for surfboards or snowboards. The ride is smooth & quiet. I just got the standard S model, but it pretty much has everything I need. Also I'm very short, 4'9" and I love the height adjustment (see below). Overall just a great car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I absolutely love the height adjustment feature that's standard on the S & SL models. It pumps the seat up about 6 inches higher, kind of like a dentist's chair.

<TEXT>I drove all the usual players in this area (Civic, Elantra, Sentra and the Corrola) The nissan is incredibly smooth and handles better than any of the others. It's also much quieter on the inside (wind and engine) than any of the others. I was surprised given how I thought about the old Sentra, but Nissan really did this car right. It has all the most important features that I look for (comfort, quiet, smooth, easy to use dash, looks nice, alloy wheels, convenience package is AWESOME, and the audio package is out of this world) I would recommend getting your Sirius radio installed too. I did the sportster 4 on the dash plugged into the aux input. This works best so you can swap 4 ipod.</TEXT>

We have the S with all the upgrades including the CVT and intelligent key. Never realized how much we like the intelligent key as we never have to take my keys out of our pockets to open, start or lock the vehicle. We also love the Rockford Fosgate stereo system.

<TEXT>I traded in my 99 Stratus for a new 07 Sentra 2.0 S with the Convenience Package. I never thought I would buy a Sentra, but after looking at the Civic, Mazda 3 and Jetta this car had the most bang for the buck. The car rides incredibly smoothly down the road and feels substantial driving down the interstate. As a taller guy I have more than plenty of leg room. The CVT transmission feels different, but ok after getting use to. Six speaker sound, AUX jack, sharp looks, bluetooth and lots of other features really make this car stand out from competition. I wouldn't recommend living in this car, but I would highly encourage a test drive. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for almost a yr now. I like in the Chicago land area. I travel 30 miles one way to work. The car was very reliable over the winter. I dont like the way the car handles in windy conditions or at speeds over 60 MPH. The only major problem I have had is the darn tire sensors which is now on every time I get into the car. My tires deflated every time the temperature changed so I had to purchase an air compressor to save time and money on having someone come put air in my tires. I was really tempted to get all new tires but there was nothing wrong with the tires on the car. So now the light never goes off. The sensors are expensive to replace (Quotes $125-$180)Hate the sensors!</TEXT>

It gave me absolutely no problems, other than I had three flat tires in 2 months because of so much local construction. One little thing, the center compartment won't close tightly anymore because I must have broken it a long time ago. Then there was a recall with the brakes. They were fixed for free by Nissan, but I knew there was something wrong when they started to squeak so soon. I think this car is great and it runs smoothly where I live (no ice/snow). I love the look of it and the interior is comfy. I love this car and I haven't had any other problems with it. Love the volume/radio controls on the wheel.</TEXT>

I have put new tires on this vehicle only after 20,000 miles thinking that was the issue, to no avail. I will never buy another Sentra. I have finally made the decision to get rid of this vehicle.

The car has mid-size room and comfort, a great powertrain with the cvt and looks good. I also have had very good experiences with Nissans in the past. We liked the car's handling when we test drove it in good weather so we bought the car. However, we soon discovered that this is the absolute worst handling car I have ever driven in snow, ice and even rain. Very unstable. After several attempts to find a solution at two dealers and a few panicked phone calls from my wife on snowy days we traded the Sentra in on an 09 Camry with stability control.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought new in April, 2007 and drove it every day until it was totaled in a near head-on crash in October 2008. Safety-wise it was great - lots of exterior damage but passenger and I remained very safe considering. Over the 18+ months and 38,000 miles of ownership it averaged 29.34 mpg. (I drive careful - about 80% highway and 20% city.) It was mechanically sound and dependable. My biggest complaint was that it's gas mileage was oversold at time of purchase. We were told it would average 33-34 mpg with our type of driving. While our mileage was OK, it fell short of promises. I'm not sure if I will buy another, but I have to consider it when weighing the known- proven crash safety, etc.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2005 Ford Escape that was only getting around 21 mpg, so I decided to trade for a smaller car. I have always heard good reviews about Nissan, so I decided to purchase the Sentra. The sticker stated 29 mpg in the city and 36 mpg on the highway. However, I am only getting around 300 miles on a tank. The owner's manual states the tank hold 14.3 gallons of fuel which should get by my estimate around 380. I feel very misled by Nissan. Even though I love the style and performance, I feel taken advantage of due to the price of oil. I am a single mother on a budget, and the whole reason for trading my small SUV was to save money.

Almost immediately I began having problems with driver's seat making squeaking noise and shifting forward/backward just to annoy me. Three dealerships, and they all say they can't duplicate it. CD player likes to fade in and out when I turn it up loud, and the drivers side door lock controls are making a "whooshing" sound when I use it. Since it's not happening "all the time", Nissan won't address the problem. I've learned it's got to break in order for them to fix it while its under warranty, otherwise wait for your warranty to expire and revisit them. They'll fix it then.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Went with it for the good mileage but I am getting lower than expected. The CVT is ok, different, but ok. Coming out of a VW Jetta and I went to this. Drives ok and being 6' it has good headroom. Trunk is ok and the hide a way trunk is ok. Overall you shouldn't expect much of the car, as I said in the title, it's only ok </TEXT>

<TEXT>I needed good commuter car to drive about 44 miles round trip a day and wanted something cheap yet elegant. Looked at the 2008 Kia Rio and other small and older cars but I got what I wanted a black 2007 Nissan Sentra. It is such a nice car to drive! It sounds solid on the road and I love the way the doors slam. No cheap sounding clank! It's big enough for 4 people and looks great. I was going to pass the car to my 15 year old daughter to drive but I think I'm going to have to buy her another car, I love this one too much to give it up.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I thought I liked this car when I test drove it but after having it a while now I wish I would have bought a Toyota Corolla. My friend just bought a new one and it seems like such a better car than mine. This Nissan's interior wears really easily... don't get if you have children! Scratch marks everywhere. It looks like I let a scared cat loose in the car. My car also had a really cheap new car scent to it. Like foam, plastic and baby barf combined. It used to upset my stomach this "new" car scent Nissan has. I tried to pull a small U-haul trailer with this car and the engine over-heated. My CD player/stereo had to be replaced the first month I bought it. Just not happy with it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Last year I decided to go back to school so I traded in my GTO because it only got 21 mpg on highway. I have an 07 maxima and I average about 26 mpg and I can get 30-32 on the highway driving 5 over the speed limit. My school is 126 miles round trip and I wanted something good on gas so I went with the sentra (which is my 8th nissan). On the highway the best I've gotten yet was 25 mpg and in town I get 19 to 20. And it's not the way I drive, with the price of gas I drive like a grandma. It's a nice little car beside that but the only reason we buy cars like this is for mpg. So even if you don't like the civic as much, it's worth it because of the gas mileage</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Sentra SL for a year now, and it has been a great car. The SL is packed with features that can not be had in most any other 'entry' level vehicle. (I've never understood why most car designers believe small is always about being the cheapest option and not about preference for many car buyers.) I've had no issues with the car to date other than something minor at the time of purchase. I was replacing a 2000 VW Jetta with the Sentra. I can say, the Sentra does not drive live a Jetta unfortunately, but once you get used it you settle in quickly. Fuel economy has been about 22-24 in city driving and 36-38 on highway over the year (w/o the air turned on).</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought a Sentra with positive expectations but we were let down. 1. The gas mileage is nowhere near what Nissan claimed. For '08 the gov has revised the criteria, but it's still optimistic. We have averaged from 20 in the city to 27 highway. I drive to maximize mileage too. 2. The wheel alignment is all over the place. Fresh from the factory, the car was defective. After much trouble Nissan aligned the front, but added way too much caster in an effort to conceal the alignment problem. The rear is still not aligned. I suspect that bad alignment is part of the cause for the bad gas mileage. If you have a Nissan, take it to the dealer and have them check the alignment. I have a lemon!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the second review of this car I've written for Edmunds. I loved it right away, but promised myself I'd come back and write more after driving for a year. What can I say? This car is fantastic. The looks of it are a bit controversial, but if you love it (like I do), you love it. This car is even great in the snow of upstate New York. People get in my car and just gush about it - which is weird considering it's a Sentra and not a BMW or something. It's even worked well as my daughter has gotten bigger and out of the car seat. We've driven it all over the northeast and had plenty of room, good fuel economy, etc. Can't recommend this car enough. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased in May of 07, traded in a Dodge Dakota. Gas mileage is in the advertised range, about 31 with regular tires and 28 with studded snow tires, mostly highway driving. Vehicle really needs snow tires if you live in a very snowy area. All weather tires will not do it. Heater works great and rear defrost works fine. Car is a little noisy under heavy acceleration. When braking car lurches forward at times but I am told that this is a product of the CVT. Gas door needs to be opened from inside and does not work properly, usually it will not open and needs some extra "help". I am 6'6" and the headroom in this car is great. Not to sure about the benefit of the trunk divider.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Over 15 months/22,000 miles of ownership, my Sentra never left me stranded and gave me good, dependable transportation to/from work. While not a sports car by any means, it could blow away any Civic or Corolla on the road. Styling was nice for a car in its price range. The CVT was a neat variation of the traditional A/T and helped make the most of the engine's power, but it was disconcerting during stops as it would often cause the car to slingshot forward while braking, almost like downshifting too early with a manual. Gas mileage was okay, typically in the mid-20s, but nowhere near the advertised 36 mpg hwy as others have mentioned. Interior was nice, but quality left a lot to be desired.</TEXT>

My X has a 07 GTI, and this is faster (we raced) and still is a larger car. It's almost like a stock sleeper.

This car is way above the Accord in fit and finish, build quality, interior quietness and other things too. This car is smoooth sailing the whole way through. Excellent power delivery with the CVT, although gas mileage is nowhere near the advertised 29/36. Hopefully it will improve once we pass 7500 or so miles. With ~5000 miles on the car, it's been great. 6 speaker prem. audio system rocks, and my iPod interfaces with the radio nicely.

<TEXT>I'm writing this the night of my first day with my new Sentra. I will give just a simple summary of what I've observed in the first 24 hours. I like the exterior. It's small-looking on the outside, but really big and roomy on the inside. The trunk space is amazing, considering it doesn't even look like it has a trunk from the outside. The engine makes a lot of noise upon acceleration, but that's the only flaw I've seen so far. It handles great, it accelerates great (minus the noise) and the interior is smartly designed. I should have no trouble parking this in the city because it's compact, but it doesn't feel like that on the inside. Overall I'm very impressed on the first day.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior design and interior design are splendid. I love the placement of the gear shift. The air vents are huge, which makes warming up the car on a cold day really quick and easy. You sit up high, which is good. Lots of little compartments up front to store stuff.</FAVORITE>

I get about 370 miles highway. Head turner! Gas mileage at 11,000 miles is still 28 city. Much more horsepower helping that tranny (CVT) on engine with the exhaust.

<TEXT>Got the 2.0s 6M in April, and I found the ride very quiet and reasonably well mannered. It certainly does not like any sort of rough road, however, where the suspension can have me bouncing around all over the cabin. The shift throw had been difficult to get used to, but that's okay. I mean, I can play "hide-n-go-seek" inside the cabin there is sooo much space! I do find the quality of the plastics inside to be lacking. The interior is very easy to mark if you are not careful but overall, a great car for my long commute, and knowing the Nissan powerplant, the engine should get me close to half a million KMs.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the car for almost a year with 20,000+ miles. No major complaints. Road noise could be a touch less, but better tires may help. One window open at 45+ mph creates some bad wind effects. Bluetooth microphone leaves a lot to be desired but call quality inside the car is great. Sound system does well compared to custom systems I've installed in previous vehicles. I wish I would've pinched for the sat radio. Trunk space is very roomy and I love the separator. Massive glove compartment with a convenient tray in the door. Site lines are good, A pillars could be a touch smaller. Seats are comfortable. Driver's arm rest padding is already breaking down. 27 MPG real avg city/hwy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Test drive the regular SE-R vs. the Spec V model and you will immediately feel the difference. The Spec V handles tighter around turns, the redline is increased, and the strong HP just pours on after 4,000 RPM. Regular SE-R power is steady with the CVT, but never producing a strong, lengthy surge like the Spec V can with a stick. 2nd gear is great in this car if you drive in traffic. 2nd can go down to 4 mph with ease. Then just ride the clutch to get going again. Power is still on tap in 6th gear. Runs fine on regular gas. 31 mpg on long hwy trip, 26.5 mixed. Glove box, trunk, and rear seats are huge. Clutch gives good push-back. RF stereo is solid.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought the car and have only 900 miles. Rated gas mileage is 29 city and 36 highway. My average mileage has only been 20.5 mpg for local driving primarily in the suburbs. The dealer tells me the car needs to break in and good mileage will be realized after 7500 miles. I have never had this experience with other new cars, at least not to this degree, so I am very concerned. The dealer cannot find anything wrong. I noticed that the new CVT has a braking effect at all times and I suspect this is the reason for the bad mileage since the car does not coast like a normal car.

<TEXT>This is a car that feels way more expensive than it was. Consider the motor: it's got liquid-filled mounts and at idle, it's so quiet I once tried to start the engine while it was running! More torque than most 2.0L engines, and I love the 6-speed (which Renault co-designed and uses in their cars). The seats are plush but supportive, good for at least 4 hrs continuous driving (I've done it). Way more backseat and trunk space than "compact" cars used to have. Tire pressure monitors, computerized (RFID key) ignition cutoff, high safety rating, all standard. Plus Nissan reliability and resale value!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Previously owned a 2001 Sentra base model which was reliable, efficient, and somewhat boring. Gave it to my daughter in 2004 and she found it reliable, efficient and somewhat boring over past three years. Man, is the SE-R not boring. Terrific handling, acceleration, braking, comfy, stylish, and the 340 watt sound system takes me back to my youth! This road hugger sold me within about three minutes of the test drive. Toss in more than acceptable mileage, a sticker price that shames the snobby competitors - this beats any BMW or Accura hands down in my books - and I may be a Sentra devotee for life.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>This car molds itself to the driver. My greatest fear in any car is lacking acceleration to merge into highway traffic. No fear here.

<TEXT>I was looking for a comfortable commuter car with good mileage, and this car fit the bill better than others I had tested. I had been a loyal Toyota customer until purchasing this car. Lots of features and much more power than the Yaris, for not much more money as optioned. I found a Sentra S with ABS, CVT, and Bluetooth. The car is extremely comfortable and quiet for a small car. Ergonomics are very good. Engine is very smooth and revs easily. I have the CVT transmission, which I have really grown to like, though initially was a bit disconcerting. Exterior styling is just OK, especially in front. Fuel economy for me is around 29 MPG (mostly highway), less than advertised.</TEXT>

It's a little bit more roomier than the Civic, which is worth the extra gas mileage, imo, but the gas mileage is still really good. It's really fun to drive (I have the 6 speed manual). I still love the design inside and out! I would totally recommend this for someone looking for a sedan in the 15-16k range. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car for a little more than 2 weeks and love it. The fuel economy that I am getting is 30/40 mpg. On the highway cruising at 65 mph, the engine was only at 2000 rpm which is key to higher gas mileage. The CVT makes the ride enjoyable. Don't underestimate the 2.0L engine, it has power behind it. The divide and hide in the trunk is great to stop soccer balls or basketballs from rolling all around the trunk. The 333W stereo system is great. I was comparing the Mazda3, Honda Civic, Mitshubishi Lancer, Toyota Camry, and Nissan Sentra. I liked the Sentra best because of price and features.</TEXT>

<TEXT> I got the 2.0 S model. I was very impressed with the smooth and quiet ride. I traded in my Dodge pick-up. I had set out to double my gas mileage and lower my monthly payment without having to settle for a bumpy ride. This car fulfilled all of that. I got the 6 speed manual because the cvt model was a little pricey for me. Both transmissions are sluggish, especially at low end, but I have more control over that with the 6 speed. The shifting is somewhat awkward. I am not happy with 29 mpg. The dash design is stylish along with the position of the shifter. I am impressed with how much room this car has. My advice: test drive this car and others to find out which aspects matter most to you.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth, quiet ride. Spacious interior. Standard cd player. Stereo controls on steering wheel. Trip info. Fold down armrest/cupholders in rear seat. Rear seats fold down to enlarge the trunk. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Decided on the Sentra after having compared it against the Honda Civic Si. Liked the Sentra better as it was quieter with a more compliant ride and had more torque. The Honda was a lot more fun in the twisties and the gear box was great, but the noise of the engine would be very tiring over a long haul along with the wind noise and the suspension was a lot less compliant. I figured unfortunately I don't live in an area with plenty of open road and uninhabited mountain passes so the Sentra seemed more civilized in that respect. Seems well put together with no rattles or sqeaks as of 1000 miles so far. Averaging 26 mpg which I suppose is average for this group of car</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The colour, the style. Quiet at highway speeds. Fun in the twisties, corners well. Stiff chassis. Good room in the back for passengers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After shopping around for a few days, we almost bought a Mazda3 but changed our mind right after we test-drove a 2007 Sentra (our previous car was Toyota Corolla). We purchased 2.0S four months ago and have never regretted a bit. Thanks to its blocky body and the height-adjustable driver?s seat, getting in and out is very easy. Inside is spacious and quality of materials used is better than competitors. The brakes with ABS work very well, although we first needed to get used to. CVT is a definite plus and the smooth flow of power is fantastic, particularly when driving on steep hills with cruise control engaged: I will never want to go back to an old-fashioned automatic transmission.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car is very nice, beat out all the others in its class, lots of upscale features, some questionable reliabilty issues. A/C compressor had to be replaced before I even bought the car. Now the passenger seat sounds like a creaky old bed when someone is sitting in it. Not major, but kinda disconcerting. Styling is top rate, car is very comfortable.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am really enjoying my 2.0SL. The car is surprisingly large inside and everything is well laid out. My previous car was an Accord, and the fit and finish on the Nissan are just not up to that standard, but the Sentra is lower on the scale than an Accord. Even though, I really love the styling, how high-up it sits, how quiet the engine is, the regular stereo sounds great and overall I am really enjoying it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the car Friday night, 4 days ago. It has been dead since Saturday. We noticed it idling rough the night we got it home, and after that it wouldn't start. Absolutely nothing happened when I turned the key - no lights, no sounds, absolutely nothing. I couldn't even get the CD out of my stereo. Yesterday I had to pay $90 to have it towed 45 miles to the nearest dealership (Nissan only pays the first $100 of the tow.) It's been a fiasco, and I'm NOT happy!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was quite impressed with room and comfort that the new Sentra provides. The CVT is awesome. The power is quite good for a 2.0 ltr engine and I have no problem with freeway or mountain driving. The headroom and shoulder room is very good. The Rockford Fosgate radio is quite good and the trip computer is a must. Why buy an Altima when you can get nearly the same thing in a Sentra.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very fun to drive, great handling, and surprisingly roomy! The new styling is very sharp. Controls are easy to reach because of the Sentra's cockpit layout. I got the convenience plus pkg with bluetooth and audio controls on the steering wheel which keeps my hands on the steering wheel. I commute to work via the interstate with speeds around 75. My Sentra has 3500 miles now and I am getting 33 mpg so far with the CVT. Very happy with the Sentra. Make sure to consider the Sentra when you do your comparisons.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only owned my 2007 Sentra SL for a few weeks, but I love it! This is my 3rd Nissan (2000 Altima and 2002 Xterra) and I keep coming back. Owning Nissans has been a great experience. No one seems to know much about the 2007 Sentra, and I enjoy showing them what it has to offer. I considered the Civic, Elantra, Mazda 3, Lancer and Cobalt. None had all the features of the Sentra.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Intelligent key is great! It is very handy. Also handy is the Bluetooth Hands-free phone system. The CVT took some time to adjust to, but I love it now. I like having the outside temperature display. The HUGE glove box can hold so much. Gas mileage has been above average.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased the new Spec V and was wowed right away with this thing. I traded in a 2003 Eclipse GT with a 3.0 V6 and this Spec V with its 2.5 inline 4 is a lot faster! This car rides like a car should (sporty to the teeth!) and with its big brake kit on the front, this thing stops on a dime. 0-60 in 6.7 and the 1/4 mile in 15.01. If you're looking for a sporty, fast, reliable, just all out sweet car, buy the Spec V! You won't regret it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I recently just bought this 07 for an 02. Power-wise there is so much of a difference, gas mileage is better, the ride is much smoother, but if you really need to move around, it will definitely do it when you need it to without it feeling squirrelly. Up to this point I'm liking a lot more than my old vehicle, and it is definitely a head turner with it being BRIGHT yellow.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought mine late May. Traded in my '99 Maxima. CVT is very smooth. Interior fit and finish is good. Don't expect 36 mpg; I've milked this thing for all it's worth, and 34 is the best I can get. Hoping the engine is just "tight" and after a few thousand miles it will get better. The radio with bluetooth is a great idea; all cars should have that feature given the number of cellphones around now. Only aggravation is the driver's sunvisor that hits the rear view mirror. Didn't any of the design engineers try that before it went into production? </TEXT>

<TEXT>Own a 2005 Sentra with 57000 miles with no issues. Bought this one to replace a 2001 Maxima. The S or SL trim levels are the way to go. The sunroof and the upgraded stereo are nice touches, also. Been averaging 33 MPG since the second tank fillup, balance of performance and fuel economy has been impressive. Love the keyless entry. Just need to get a Bluetooth phone now to take advantage of that feature.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned this car for about 5 months. The only complaint I had was the gas mileage wasn't that great, getting only 26-27 mpg driving a mix of highway-city. Now it seems to have improved after the first service or break-in period. It is 29-30. I am hoping it will get better from here as I get used to the car. I have about 5,000 miles on it and love it more every day - the comfortable interior, sporty look, handling and suspension. I see people staring at this car to check it out.Trunk is spacious. Stereo rocks! A lot of standard features for a very reasonable price. All the airbags make this car a great choice if you have a family. Can't beat it, no regrets on this purchase whatsoever.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the 2.0 SL version. The CVT is silky smooth. The ride quality is on the soft side, and comfortable on all but the most pot-holed and patched roads. The car is also very quiet. You hear the engine during acceleration when it's cold or when you need instant power, but won't hear it during general driving. Build quality is good - there were no obvious mistakes on my car, and the fit and finish of the materials is excellent. Steering is a little over-boosted, but responsive. The glove box is HUGE along with the trunk. The Sentra is worth considering if you're in the market for a small car, especially if you're looking for an up-market version with special features. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I bought the SL version, and have all the options except for a rear spoiler. Leather, sunroof, six-disc in-dash CD AM/FM radio (with satellite radio option - XM or Sirius) and AUX input for iPod, and ABS brakes. Bluetooth integration with my cell phone is great! Love the wireless key!!</FAVORITE>
