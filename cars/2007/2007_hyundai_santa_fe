<TEXT>I purchase this car for my wife's birthday a couple of years ago. She has been the primary driver. I have maintained the vehicle since new, and the only things I have done are routine maintenance. The tires will need to be replaced soon, but they are OEM and have give good service. The fit and finish rival the best SUV's out there. It has NO squeaks or rattles and the paint looks like new. The last time I had the tires rotated and balanced the brakes showed only 50% wear. My wife's cars always eat pads, so I am really impressed. Everything works just like it was new. Absolutely no problems. The warranty is the best in the industry. Can't beat it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Steering wheel controls. Many thoughtful little features that are standard on all Hyundais. Taken alone one is not so important, but when put together they indicate real thought and planning in making this a very practical and functional vehicle. The build execution is excellent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased this vehicle new off the truck. Thought I was getting a good deal for the money, but have had nothing but problems with this vehicle. Had to put new tires on at 18,000 miles, along with new rear brakes. Hyundai would NOT even speak to us about it. "Wear Items". Now at 25000 miles it has been in the shop 4 times for throttle sensor issues. Actually had the dealer I purchased the vehicle from deem the car UNSAFE to drive out of their repair shop at 18,000 miles. RIDICULOUS. Never owned such a undependable vehicle. Will NEVER purchase another Hyundai. Currently getting ready to contact an attorney in regards to this terrible vehicle. SAVE YOUR MONEY!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle has been a joy to drive. I still have not Had any of the problems written about by others. I have not had any interior light problems either.  This could be because I purchased vehicle at the end of May 2007.  Earlier models in the year may not have had all of the interior map/dome lights and automatic switches installed at time of purchase.  I learned from past experience to purchase a new vehicle as late in model year as possible.  This way manufacture, would have gotten feed back on your particular model/make. For example; if you purchased your Santa Fe Limited 3.3 liter engine in september of 2006, interior lights may not have come on when doors were opened. Later on yes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roominess, drivability,storage,wide comfortable seats,leg room in rear seat area, reclining rear seats, my passengers loved this feature on recent long trip to Washington D.C.,heated front seats with automatic lumbar support,compass in rear view mirror, it's perfect interior/exterior size,value.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the car new in November 2007. Having high hopes this would be the last car I would have to buy for a long time. I had the car in for the 15,000 mile maintenance in July 2009 and mentioned it had started making a roaring noise, more prevalent at lower speeds. I was told it was tire noise and the tires were feathering. I have had the tires rotated at the specified times why would they feather? If they are feathering at 15,000 miles something's wrong! I have not been able to get any results from Hyundai as to the real problem. The car is also downshifting hard at 30 miles when coming to a stop. I don't think I'll be buying any make, model or type of Hyundai again. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Although a comfortable car, I have had chronic problems with the sensors since it reached about 13,000 miles. I currently only have 21,000 miles, and yet it has been in the shop three times this summer, and probably 8 times last summer. Every time they think they have found which sensor it is, a few weeks later the check engine light comes on after the car starts hesitating and what seems like misfiring. When you pay $26000 for a new car, you should be able to rely on it when you still have such low mileage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove or looked at other small SUVs. I purchased the Santa Fe Limited. The 3.3 liter engine is the best choice as appose to the 2.7 liter engine. My mechanic told me that the smaller engine is just a hiped up four cylinder engine. Even though the gas mileage suffers some what. The added power was worth it to me. I love driving this truck. it handles like a car and rides smoothly. After two plus years,the firm ride has loosened up a bit. I've driven it from New York to Soutn Carolina, to Montauk Point and Orient Point from Western Nassua. Also four trips to Maryland. The Santa Fe had good manners at highway speeds. It did not drift like others have reported. I love everything.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased car used with 17K miles from dealer. Reading was 20.1 mpg, drove it home and mpg began to drop immediately. Went as low as 12.8 but then had problem with 02 sensor. Dealer said that mileage would improve after replacement. It got a little better, now back up to 15.1, city.On trips to Tahoe the best mpg was 18. Overall, I like the car but given the times, one can't make buying decisions on cars w/o taking mpg into account. I would never have bought this car if I'd known what the true mileage would be. I think that all of the disclaimers given by both the dealers and the feds are outrageous. A consumer should be entitled to minimal expectations for such a critical feature.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Santa Fe is quieter and more enjoyable to drive than my Buick Rendezvous that I really liked. It's got a lot of standard features considering the fact that this is the base model. The 2.7 automatic V6 is OK in coastal NC where we live but strains in the mountains according to my wife (I wasn't with her). The stick-shift feature apparently was useful in coping with the steeper road grades. At 16.5 MPG city, fuel economy is disappointing. No problems at all so far but after 3 1/2 months, we only have 2,900 miles on it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>1.5 months of ownership (2500 miles) the car broke down on the road. Due to the lack of parts the repair took 2 weeks (3cat converters and 2 O2 sensors). Two weeks later the car broke down again this time it was a computer module and a disconected wire. While driving car home from the dealer I noticed that the engine noise was so loud the I could not hear the radio. It is now back at the dealer waiting for repair for the 3rd time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Don't be put off by the name Hyundai. They are building some of the best cars out there and the 2007 Santa Fe is no exception. The car is almost flawless in the fit and finish. The paint quality is superb. The gas mileage is around 22 which is pretty good for a seven seat SUV. The engine is whisper quiet even when cold. It is like getting a Lexus at half price! I hit a Deer with the Santa Fe going about 40 and killed the deer. The car only had a tiny dent on the bumber so you know they are built well. The 18" tires are nice and standard. Well done Hyundai!</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>Having previously owned a 2003 Santa Fe, when the new 2007 came out I had to have one. It was the biggest mistake I have ever made. Hyundai Motor America has been completely uncooperative in regards to warranty issues. Hyundai may offer a great warranty but don't be fooled. I was sold a lemon! The car has been in the shop EIGHT times since we bought it nine months ago. The car had a faulty engine coil, misfiring in the 5th cylinder (4 times), entire fuel system malfunction, improperly installed computer software and finally two bad oxygen sensors. We are so fed up that we are now selling the 2003 because we just need to cut all ties with Hyundai. Buyer beware!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is by far the best car that we've ever owned, and I'm not just saying this because my husband helped build it.It really is. Everyone who rides in it comments on the smooth ride and how quite it is. So far I've been averaging about 21 mpg (in-town/ highway), which is about what I expected. We've only had the car for about 3 months, but we've taken it on 2 trips. Preformed excellently on both. I love this car, and to be honest, I feel a little sorry for anyone who isn't driving one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was first impressed, but quickly disappointed. After owning the vehicle for 2 weeks, the rear right tail light had built up condensation. Then the check engine light came on and found out that the Catalytic converter was bad....how can that be? I do not even have 8 thousand miles on the vehicle and I am dumping it. Oh yeah...one more thing...the stupid visor on the passengers side fell completely off...just hanging by a few wires.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle because I really like the new body style on the 07. I looked at all the other comparable SUV's and thought I would take a chance on the Santa Fe because of the warranty. Really nice ride compared to my old Rav 4. Not too big but just right for my family of 4. I do alot of road mileage and am getting approx 24 MPG as stated for highway and 22 combined driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This model vehicle is not getting the mileage I was told I would get. At 3000 miles I called the dealer and told him I was getting 19.1 hwy mile per gallon. She told me I would have to have about 6000 to get the miles that was on the sticker. At 6000 miles i called her and she told me it would get better after 8000 mile. I knew something was not right. I took it to the dealer and had a diagnostic check and everything was within the parramimeters of the manufactorers specs. I now have 11000 miles on the car and I am getting 19.8 hwy. My sticker said 19 city and 25 hwy. A dealer in Ohio said I would not get any better. I would not reccomend this car for fuel mileage the 2008sticker 17 and 23 </TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned a 2003 Hyundai Sante Fe, and LOVED it; drove it into the ground. Once it died, I was being pushed to buy a Tucson, which I didn't like. I bought the new Sante Fe SE and LOVE the black mahogany type trim on the dash, and easily accessible dash features. The fabric in the newer models as well as the interior trim of the doors is much less durable, with scuff marks appearing very easily. The older models had a more "chenille" type fabric, but the newer models have a flat and rough type fabric. I LOVE the "Miles to Empty" Gas Gauge!!! This car handles smoothly and is MUCH quieter than Hyundai's other models.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Driving is decent for an SUV along with the looks however I have owned my "first-time Hyundai" 2 months and it has been in the shop over half of that due to a sunroof issue. I am on my 5th sunroof and the problems are still not corrected. I contacted the consumer affairs department and received a case number and that is the last time I have heard from them. I have called to update information and have been told repeatedly that my case manager will be in touch and this has been going on for a month with still no contact. The sunroof still leaks and when open rattles to the point it sounds like the glass is going to brake. Now, I am again waiting for them to decide what to do. Horrible!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I looked at all of the SUV's / CUV's in this class and while I was trying to steer her other more conservative directions, she liked the Santa Fe the most so we bought. I have been impressed so far with the overall design, build quality, and performance of this vehicle. We have had it back to the dealer for a few very minor warranty issues and everything has been handled in a satisfactory manner. If Hyundai continues this direction then they will no doubt be a serious threat to Toyota and Honda in short order. IMO Toyota and Honda still have an edge in quality and reputation, but Hyundai is a better value...you get much more for your money.</TEXT>

I saved myself a lot of money and I have a great car!!!! More I drive this car more I like it. I still get stunned every time I turn how tight the turning radius is. I just added the "premium package" and enjoy my moon roof on "top" of everything else this car has. It's a great crossover SUV that drives like a luxury car but has plenty of storage and power of the SUV.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched many different SUV's and test drove most of them. After all was said and done I selected the Hyundai Santa Fe Limited with FWD. I wanted all the options that the Santa Fe offered. I added 20" mag wheels with wide tires. I must say this is the best overall vehicle I have ever owned. It answers all my driving needs completely and I would suggest that anyone looking at a Honda, Toyota, Mazada, Kia or any SUV to strongly take a look and test drive the Fanta Fe Limited. This is, by far, the best vehicle, quality wise and safety wise that you can buy for the money you pay. I have never owned a Hyundai and never thought I would until I checked out the reviews and the vehicle itself.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought the Limited with all the extras. Interior quite nice with leather, but after a 2000 mile trip a bit disappointing. Read all the reviews beforehand.....comfort for driver is good (power seat) but front passenger is lousy. Seats too short, power seat not available. Picking up road noise already and bumpier ride than expected. Cabin a bit small for front passenger afer a few hours and seats too short to rest legs, can't adjust seat enough to compensate. Did not expect comfort to disappear so quickly. It is definitely a lightweight in windy conditions also. Very disappointed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought this a few days ago for my wife after trading my 12 year old Isuzu Trooper in. The Santa Fe feels decidely different than the SUV - it feels much more like a car, and the car chassis build is the clear reason. Its taking me a while to get used to the lower seating compared to the Trooper, reduced powwer and somwwhat limiting rear visibility so far. But those are areas I feel I can get accustomed to - its a differrent vehicle after all. The Santa Fe handles well for its class, feels luxurious for the price on the inside, has modern styling, provides good fuel economy for the class, and is fun to drive around and do regular chores in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought 2007 SF SE with no option packages. Priced as a family sedan, this amazing SUV (or CUV, call it whatever you want) performs as a high-priced Lexus! Fuel economy is OK, not great but c'mon, this is sport utility with 3.3L engine. Don't expect to get 28-30 miles per gallon because it's not a economy car. Just buy it and enjoy it!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my Santa Fe a few days ago and I can't stop smiling. I ruled the car out in the beginning of my SUV search because I didn't know the body style had changed this year. Originally went to look at the VeraCruz and quickly changed my mind. The 2007 Santa Fe is beautiful! The interior for the price is really what got me. I love the blue lights, touch of chrome, and wood accents. The dual climate control is awesome because I can be freezing when my boyfriends hot. I looked at every SUV out there: Mitsubishis, Hondas, Nissans, Toyotas, Jeeps. You name it, I looked into it. The Santa Fe was the first car I didn't have a single complaint about. I cant stop smiling when I'm driving it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our 2007 Santa Fe after several weeks of near obsessive on-line research. With two teen drivers, safety was our number one priority. The Santa Fe offers front, side and curtain airbags; anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control all standard. It also weighs more than many of its competitors. (It is a Top Pick for safety from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.) Price/Value was equally imortant to us. The CRV and RAV4, lacked many of the amenities that are standard on the Santa Fe and can't compare on the warranty and yet are priced thousands of dollars higher. We also happen to like the look of the newly designed Santa Fe so our decision was made. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The safety features are the reason we bought the car, hopefully we'll never have to put them to the test. The interior is really pretty and has a more upscale feel and more amenities than any other SUV in this price range.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wish the DVD controls were located somewhere else.they get kicked alot. the light interior looks nice,but is not kid-friendly.I really love my Santa Fe.The '07 is so much more luxurious than my previous '01.I like my Santa Fe better than my husband's BMW 325i. We always take my Santa Fe on roadtrips, not the BMW. I love the space, the drive, the warranty, the look & I feel smart driving it. It's a good bang for the buck! There's only 1 Santa Fe to choose: Limited & fully loaded. i didn't like the bare bones models. Bite the bullet & spend the $32K for the top of the line Santa Fe.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Crazy as it sounds, I LOVE the mute button for the stereo & steering wheel radio controls. I also love dual temp a/c and heat, heated seats, 2007 just has way more amenities than my old 2001 Santa Fe.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After my lease on my 2004 Toyota Highlander expired, I thought about a new 2007 Highlander. I also took a hard look at Hyundai's Santa Fe and Subaru's Forester. In the end, I took a chance on Hyundai--- a 'chance' because, after all, this is the parent company with the DNA of the Excel I remember so well from the late 80's. Well, the Santa Fe has proven to be a winner. It meets or exceeds Highlander's standards in every aspect except fuel economy. Fit and finish is superb. The cabin is quiet and comofortable, steering responsive and confident. I recommend the Santa Fe for anyone looking for a CUV. It compares to, or exceeds, the best the rest of the field has to offer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased our SE AWD back in March and just love it. Have had it on 2 long road trips, and it is so fun and comfortable to drive. I was a little reluctant about getting a Hyundai, but after owning the vehicle for 4 months, no regrets. We test drove the CRV and others, no comparison in value, features, and comfort. Many comments here about the poor interior lighting. Hyundai has corrected this on never production models, and they will fix older 2007 vehicles for free if you ask. My map lights now go on when the doors are opened. Great customer service from Hyundai USA on this. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We're just over 3000 miles into our new Santa Fe which we bought after a 5 minute test drive having read the reviews on line. Wow what a motor, my wife has moved from Mercedes Benz to Hyundai and no wonder what a super product. We test drove the new 2008 C Class today just to compare the two brands. The Santa Fe 3.3ltr Ltd edition in Black with Cream Leather interior and the high driving position wins hands down. We had a spin in the 2.7 litre version which also impressed however the bigger engine makes a massive difference to the overall driving experience. For those of you lucky enough to own the new Santa Fe happy motoring for those of you who are still sitting on the fence enjoy the view</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had my Santa Fe for a month, but so far, so good. I was a little worried about getting a Hyundai until I test drove this SUV. Hyundai has redesigned the body style and finally, it doesn't look like a cheap rounded SUV. You can't beat the value either. I was orginally looking at the Honda CR-V but the prices are so high for a smaller SUV. The Santa Fe drives very smooth like a luxury car and is easy to handle. This is my first SUV, going from driving a small two door car. The Santa Fe has made the transition an easy one.It is great that things such as XM radio come standard with this SUV. </TEXT>

Honda Pilot, 4-Runner, CX7, CX9, Kia Sorento... then in the car area we almost settled on a pre-owned(10k) Infiniti G35 but we have 3 kids so we were looking for blend of what our Oddysey and our Matrix gave us... Plenty of space inside for trips and modern functionality in a cool package When we drove the Santa Fe we fell in love and knew it... not only is the car briliantly engineered inside and out...

With my trade in and all the taxes and tags I walked away with the car paying only $20,138.00! I feel like the Hyundai Santa Fe is the best kept secret out there. I have all the options that I wanted except for an aux plug, which I will have installed very soon. I think you get so much bang for your money why pay up $5000 more to get the same thing. Once again I am very happy with car and my only complaint is that mileage could be better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased the pearl white model and it's a real head turner. The SUV is beautiful inside and out. I notice other SUV drivers looking at it in traffic and I've even had some approach me to check it out. I could see their jealousy and envy in their faces. I feel badly for the people who bought a 2006 Santa Fe. I would be kicking myself right now. When my wife suggested a Hyundai I thought she was nuts. (The name stigma). But after ALOT of research, on this, the CR-V, the Rav4, and the Forester, the Santa Fe blew them away. I was impressed with how far Hyundai has come. It's no longer the high rent Yugo, it's now the low rent Lexus!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Driven AWD SE for 6 month, 6000 miles. Ownership experience has been great with no problems. Before purchase, did a lot of magazine and internet research. Except for expensive luxury SUVs, test drove all small and mid-size SUVs on same road course, with mix of freeway and hilly, curvy streets and surface streets purposely with rough pavement and potholes. For drivability and comfort, narrowed choice down to Santa Fe, Nissan, Acura and Ford Edge. After negotiating price, Santa Fe blew the others away. For SUV, drives well on freeways and mountain roads. Very smooth, quiet and comfortable ride. Seats are comfortable. Mileage in-town around 18; highway 19-20.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We looked at the Toyota Rav4, GMC Envoy, and Honda Pilot, and this is the best of all of those. There are so many thoughtful features in it that I've been discovering for the past 2 weeks. It has lighted cup holders when your head lights are on, a gasoline sensor so the air in the cabin doesn't have gas in it, and the Mp3 capibilities. The ride is a bit rough, but the leather seats comphensate for that. Getting leather at 26,400$ is a great buy! The wheels may cost a lot of money to replace though. This Santa Fe blows its older model away with better looks, better interior, and better fit and finish. (One word of caution: The limited AWD w/ 5 seats only is very rare, so look around)</TEXT>

<TEXT>nearing 700 miles in 3 weeks. It's great, surpasses my expectations. Just as a frame of reference, our other car is a 2007 Avalon Limited. The Santa Fe is very nearly as quiet!!! Santa Fe steering is quicker ratio, thus feels very nimble, fun to drive, Very easy to park. All controls intuitive. Ride is reaonably smooth, only sign. bumps register (but remember I'm spoiled by the Avalon). COmpared to many other SUV's I've riden in, the Santa Fe is genuinely most car like in ride. Drags our 2700# boat up the ramps easily, way easier than our former car. Back storage/room is very practical. We love it. Don't buy anything until you've tested a Santa Fe.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When my wife and I decided to buy a small SUV as a 3rd vehicle, we first looked at the Hyundai Tucson. We liked it a lot but decided to also look at the Santa Fe. We were immediately impressed and after checking out all competitors, we bought our Limited AWD with XM and Premium Package fresh off the truck. After 1 month and 1500 miles I can say positively that the Santa Fe is a wonderful SUV. It's comfortable, well-built, and every bit as enjoyable to drive as our former Volvo XC90. The Santa Fe has the feel of a much more expensive vehicle. There are no rattles or squeaks and everything has a solid feel to it. I'm a "car guy" and this Hyundai has not disappointed me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the Santa Fe after spending a long time looking at RAV4's and CR- Vs. The ride of the SF makes it feel like a much more expensive car compared to the other 2. The interior is substantially better than the RAV4, and the acceleration is better than the CR-V. I liked the styling of the SF better. I found that, comparably equipped, I could purchase the SF for $4-$5k less than the Toyota or Honda (though I'll give that back later with the worse depreciation.) The fit & finish is pretty good, especially inside. However, some body panels gaps aren't as straight as they should be - specifically where the hood meets the grill/headlights. It's definitely not as good as the CR-V.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Previously owned a Subaru Outback, then Mazda Tribute. Test drove Toyota RAV, Highlander, Honda Pilot and Mazda CX-7 and 9. The Santa Fe was by far the best vehicle for us and best value. Quiet comfortable cabin. Plenty of HP and smooth shifting. We were looking for a larger vehicle than the Tribute and though we would buy the Pilot but after comparing all, it was no contest, Santa Fe hands down. The size is right for us, the finish inside is outstanding with great controls, plenty of knee and leg room, firm but comfortable seats and a great driving position. Exterior styling has an "attitude." Getting 18 MPG around town and 23+ on a trip from Denver to Aspen and back. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Just picked up my '07 SF Limited 5/31. Just about 600 miles. The interior design is what won me over and rave reviews from all that has seen it. At 5'9 the headroom is fine for me. Alot of vehicle for the money compared to Ford Edge, Mazada CX7, and Murano and way better style size and interior standard features than RAV4 (which my wife drives a '07 bought in Feb. 07) and CRV. SF has a firm positive ride feel to it. Seems like a much larger and heavier vehicle when driving but being very responsive and sure footed. The power isn't the best in class, but it will get out of its way very easily and smoothly. Unbelievable quiet ride. To sum up, so far very pleased and happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I shopped extensively for a midsize SUV. I needed three rows of seats and AWD, but wanted a compact package, decent mileage, and a modest price. I almost bought a RAV4 limited, and boy am I glad I decided to test drive a Santa Fe first! For the money, you get a LOT more space and features in the Santa Fe. I had a hard time finding a Limited with touring pkg (3 rows) and without the sunroof, but I finally did and paid $28,000 even (after rebate). So far, my only complaints are the lack of an AUX input on the stereo (for an ipod), and only adequate FM radio reception. It drives great and looks great.

<TEXT>Found that we needed a vehicle to replace our aging mini-van, and since we live where it does snow, wanted something with either all wheel or 4 wheel drive. Compared a Honda CR-V and the RAV4 with the Hyundai Santa Fe. It ended up being no contest! The Hyundai in the SE trim level is loaded with safety/convience/comfort items. We also qualified for special financing, which clinched the deal. The redesign of the Santa Fe has created a beautiful looking vehicle both inside and out. I had a guy think it was a Lexus! And if you're considering a SUV check out the Santa Fe, especially in the Dark Cherry Red (which is what we got), it's stunning.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I leased my new Hyudai Sante Fe in April of 2007. Everything about the comfort, style, performace and practicality of the verhicle is excellent.....except for the gas milage. I had previoiusly been driving a Buick Rendevous and the Sante Fe was advertised as similar gas mileage. But my expereince has been far below that estimate. I am averaging only 15 miles per gallon in the city and 18 on the highway. This has been a big disappointment. I'm glad I only leased and not purchased this SUV. The sad part is if I DID get closer to the advertised gas milage, this would be the perfect vehicle for me and I would purchase it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Santa Fe is a great car and value (we bought ours for a little less than 21k, after incentives). It has been the best driving car we have owned, better than our Civics, Maximas, or Camrys. My parents have had 0 Sonata (they bought it for 10k new a few years ago).</TEXT>

<TEXT>This SUV purchase was a no brainer! After test driving Murano, CX-7, CR-V, and RAV4,and doing a price and options comparison we went hands down with the Santa Fe. Not only we got a very well made vehicle fully loaded,(limited), but we got a killer warranty along with it for added peace of mind. 10k more for the Murano was not justifiable,6k more for the RAV4 for 4 more mpg, didn't do it for us with less equipment, less warranty and a Jeepy style, CX-7 didn't have the right engine, and the CR-V can't even compare. The Santa Fe drives like a luxury car, very quiet and great ride. Standard equipment list is impressive. Very good fit and finish. For us, the clear winner at the end of the day.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just traded a 2003 Santa Fe for a 2007 Limited. This car drives better than my wife's Highlander and friends Lexus RX. The quality and style in one package are the best for the money. I loved my 2003 Santa Fe, but this car is a world of difference in quality and ride. If you are considering a mid- size SUV do yourself a favor and test drive the new Santa Fe. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have over 5000 miles on this vehicle and I love it. It handles well, rides well for an SUV and has a quiet interior. That was important to me as my previous Honda CRV drove me crazy with road noise. It is a sexy looking vehicle as well. Gas mileage is not bad for the weight of the vehicle. I get 18-19 city and 22-23 highway at 75-80 mph. Highway mileage increases dramatically to 25- 26 if you travel at 70 mph. I must qualify this by saying that I live in southern AZ where the roads are flat with little hill climbing. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We recently purchased a 2007 Santa Fe Limited to replace our Toyota Camry and my wife absolutely love it. We had spent almost ten months of research test driving almost everything from Accord, Camry, Sonata, Highlander, Rav4, CR- V, Explorer, Escape, etc. The ride is silky smooth and is very quiet. Quality touches abound throughout and we are also impressed by how well it absorbs road imperfections and the comfortable leather seats. My wife really enjoys all the saftey features that come standard and the oodles of storage space that this SUV has. So far average fuel economy is 22 mpg. This vehicle is miles ahead of the Rav4. Well done Hyundai.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dual zone auto a/c climate controls and A/C filtration system. 605 watt Infinity stereo sound system. Multiple storage compartments.

<TEXT>This vehicle combines the best features of all of it's competitors into one smart affordable package. The Santa Fe doesn't necessarily excel in any single category but the sum of all the parts beats most every competitor. When you factor in the price it is clearly the top of the small SUV category and even competes with mid- size offerings. I would say the only drawback would be the fuel economy. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Interior comfort is superb. Performance is not sporty but very spirited. Around town the tight handling and great low speed agility make driving fun. On the highway the ride is comfy and confident. The 5 speed auto is as smooth as many luxury cars. Interior room is very impressive for this class.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After test driving around 10 other SUV's my top choice was the Santa Fe. We tend to be a low mileage family (currently our 2002 Grand Caravan just turned 40,000), I was looking at something that I plan to drive into the ground. I needed a vehicle to haul our young children and my fishing tackle. So many aspects drew me to the Santa Fe. I would recommend this to anyone. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We just purchased a 2007 Hyundai Santa Fe. We already (and still) own a 2003 Hyudai Santa Fe and are very pleased with the reliability and superior value this vehicle provides for an SUV. The handling is excellent, the value for the money is superior, and improvements in standard features and exterior styling have made the Santa Fe even more desirable. Now that we have 2 Hyundai Santa Fe's in our family, just call us crazy about our Hyundais.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the second Hyundai I have owned. The first one I drove 130,000 and turned it over to my Son. The car still runs very well. I had a Honda Pilot SUV before and liked it better but it's a lot more pricy then the Santa Fe so you have your trade offs. I bought this vehicle on the last day of the month and actually walked out of the dealership because they wouldn't meet my price. Three hours later they called me and agreed to sell me the Santa Fe for what I wanted. Always buy at the end of the month. You will get what you want or the dealership just couldn't do the deal.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Shopped around. Looked at the 4cyl competitors such as the X-Trail, CRV, Forester etc. But we need to tow a small boat and the 2000lb capacity of those models swayed us to a V6, reluctantly. We drove Endeavor, Pilot, a used ML and a couple others. We like that the styling is brand new so it won't look out of date for a while. MUCH better than the old model. There really was no other choices that made sense. Toyotas and Hondas with leather were 40K and really didn't seem better. Sincerely the best bang for the buck out there in a mid-size SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling. The 19" wheels give it a nice stance. The 3.3 litre has plenty of jam for only a tiny sacrifice in economy and price. The dual exhaust looks great with the oval pipes. Visibily is outstanding when backing up. Illuminiated cup holders are bit blingy, but cool looking.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only been in this car about 2 weeks, but, I love it. I just got out of an Infiniti G35X and it is just as fun to drive. This is my first Hyundai and I'm very impressed. I have the mid- level SE version and it is a lot of SUV for the buck. My wife has a Jeep Liberty and the ride is harsh. This SUV rides like a dream. It is also roomier. You can't beat the warranty either. The earlier version has weaker lines and the redesign fits right in with what I wanted. The deepwater ocean blue is glittery in the sun and looks hot with the beige interior. Back deck, without the 3rd row seat, has small storage compartments and comes with a thick rubber mat to protect the back. Visibility is excellent.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>LOVE the blue interior lighting. Even the cup holders are illuminated. Roomy. Fit and finish is excellent. Just as impressive as my Infiniti. Interior controls well layed out. XM radio is cool and you get 3 free months on signing. Plenty of outlets for a portable DVD player. Averaging 18-19mpg city.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my SF for 2 weeks now and just LOVE IT!!! The only reason I researched it was because all the other SUVs were overpriced, so I was going to settle on a Tucson. The dealer didn't have a white one but a White Santa Fe GLS was parked right next to the Tucsons and I immediately fell in love with the gorgeous body style. After looking at the spacious interior and the beautiful blue colored dash, I test drove it and was SOLD!! I still did some research and price comparisons but I knew I was dead set on buying one. I ended up buying the SE trim because the options were so reasonably priced. Now when I carpool, I really miss my Santa Fe and want to hug it when I come home. =)</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very happy with my 2007 Hyundai Santa Fe Limited. I do wish I had waited until it had been out longer so I could have gotten the included XM radio and so my husband could have gotten automatic map lights (the lack of which drives him crazy; me, not so much). I have noticed that the wind noise is greatly increased since my test drive, otherwise the ride is great. Also, the leather seats are too hard for most people. My hubby hates them and even my 11-year-old little sister commented on them as soon as she got in the vehicle. However, when you drive the vehicle everyday, the seats are fine. Just depends on what you're used to.</TEXT>

We really liked the exterior/interior design, V6 engine, interior space, ride, and price. The Santa Fe offers a lot more than the CR-V and the quality seems very good. Outside of the fuel difference between the 4 cyl CR-V and the 6 cyl Santa Fe, the Santa Fe is much better buy in my mind. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Love to look at Santa Fe from any angle. Every bit as nice as any SUV in it's size and I feel like I'm in a Lexus or a BMW with really no trade-off. Two years, 41k and still seems like new. Competent handling vehicle all-around. Excellent utility, visibility, pleasure to drive, haul stuff, and to carry 4-5 passengers. I regularly have 4 adults and 4 sets of golf clubs. Paint shine great. Blue lighting on the dash being so nice. People are impressed by this car. Friend with an 07 Jeep Cherokee which was double the price, he comments that his car has virtually no advantage over mine. He has rarely ever engaged his 4 wheel drive. He gets 15mpg, I average 22 around town and 26 hwy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having owned this vehicle almost 2 years I can say that it is one impressive vehicle. I was skeptical at first about buying a Hyundai but I'm glad I did. The car has held up extremely well and there are no issues whatsoever. I drove the Rav4, CR-V, Vue, CX-7, and Murano before deciding on the Santa Fe and do not regret it to this day. A deer ran out in front of me one night not too long ago and had to replace the front bumper, driver side headlamp,driver front fender and various components. Though insurance covered it the total cost was close to $5,000.00, it is not a very cheap vehicle to repair if ever in a minor accident. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet ride, strong brakes, excellent build quality. Ability to leave the headlamp switch on and they turn themselves off once you exit the car. Blue backlighting on the interior controls is a nice touch. I'm very impressed with the smoothness and quietness of the powertrain. About 20 mpg average</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I enjoy my 2007 Santa Fe alot better than my 2003 Jeep Liberty. The design of all the interior storage was a huge selling point for me. I also like the look of the interior, it is so much nicer than the Liberty. I agree with one of the other people about some more goodies being added to this model.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Dodge Dakota Lease expired so I looked for another truck-like vehicle with a 6 cyl. vs. an 8. After all the research my wife and I bought the fully loaded Limited. So far we have c.4000 mi. and have really enjoyed this. We have traveled to OKC and San Antonio since Dec. 20 and commute about 70 mi.RT. The rear seat entertainment with the Infinity sound system is worth it. If I have to drive this is the way to go. The power is more than adequate (too many tickets anyway) and I can haul lots of stuff and/or passengers. I drive about 5 to 10 over the limit but sometimes look down and I'm doing 90. My point is I'm getting about 21mpg and that's not bad for a rating of 20-24mpg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>1. I really like the idea of loading up a vehicle with the options and keeping the price under 30K. 2. I have the Ebony Black and when its clean its beautiful. 3. The size is perfect. 4. Heating and Air system. 5. All the air bags. 6. Heated seats even in Houston this winter.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We initially overlooked the SF, mainly due to the old stigma of Hyundai. We looked at The Toyota's RAV4 and Highlander, the Honda CRV, the Ford Edge and the Mitsubishi Outlander. All had their good and bad qualities. I did the research and decided to take another look at the SF. I'm glad we did. The SF excelled in appearence, safety features, warranty & price. It was easily $3-5,000 less than the other models, loaded. Hyundai really did their homework, it's like they took the best attributes of all of the vehicles we tested and put them in one package. Their attention to detail on the interior is noticible. Granted, it's not perfect, but for the price, it's an exceptional value.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dual climate control & blue lighting on the instrumentation panel were nice touches, along with the wood grain. Fog Lights, auto-dim mirror and tail spoiler are standard. The standard stereo has great sound as well & a host of standard safety features & no clumsy rear tire mounted on the rear hatch.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle is worth every penny I paid for it. The exterior body design is such an improvement over past Sante Fe's. The interior is well laid out and uses quality materials. Leather Seats on the limited are more comfortable than the cloth seats. All the built in safety features make it very insurance friendly. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been a minivan driver for 10 years, but this year upgraded to my first "luxury" car. I've always been ambivalent about cars -- just get me to and from and I'm happy. But I love this car! It rides like an absolute dream. Most recently I had a used 2001 Odyssey that I have to say, I hated. It was never that comfortable and I had a devil of a time figuring out the panel. My husband had an Elantra I took over but wanted something bigger for kids, groceries, etc. and got the 7 seater. This car is total luxury, great ride, beautiful. I admit, I haven't taken it on the highway yet, but I think it'll make any trip more enjoyable.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>So much car for such relatively little money! The panel is relatively easy to figure out and navigate. I love the interior lights, and the side mirrors seem to darken the lights of people behind me at night, which is nice. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our first Hyundai product and having owned Toyota and Honda, we're sold! Drives and rides like a luxury SUV, most people can't believe it's a Hyundai which still has a somewhat negative connotation associated with the company for some reason.

<TEXT>The SF has proven to be the right economical choice for a small SUV, but comes with a few surprise nuisances. We love the interior and exterior styling and feel that we are getting more features for our money. We are very happy, but I caution people on two fronts 1) we are not getting 19/24 mpg ? we see more like 16.5 2) The front driver seat because of the lumbar support (a late engineering addition?) pushes out at your upper back creating an uncomfortable driver seat. My suggestion is to take a good long test drive to test out the seat and fuel economy (reset the mpg gauge to see what you get how you drive). I still would have bought the Santa Fe, but would have not been surprised. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been a GM guy my whole lfe. My last ride was an 03 Avalanche. Not a very reliable vehicle. I had not expected to buy a Hyundai, however when I saw it, and then drove it, I was sold. I test drove an Acura RDX, a Murano, a Lexus, a Honda, a Torrent, 2 Toyota's. Not one of them fit my most basic needs, room for 4 sets of golf clubs, a good stereo, and a good looking vehicle. All for a reasonable (not cheap) price.The Sante Fe fit the bill. So far (600 miles, 2 weeks) I am still surprised by it. Gas mileage of 22+, and it looks like its only getting better. Hopefully all of the good things I have been reading about Hyundai's overall quality improvement will hold true.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Without a doubt the sunroof. I drive with it open all the time, even at freezing temperatures. Good stereo, good seperation, great clarity of sound. Comfortable seats. Good acceleration, and handling. Manu-matic tranny. It's nice to be able to control speed with the tranny, not the brakes.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am impressed - not much out there that delivers that much value. 100K, 10yr bumper2bumper warranty upgrade is a no-brainer. The quality is convincing, the design well thought out. Plenty of room and the air-vents in the cargo area are perfect for dog owners. Low-tire pressure warning - nice touch, but the tires are not something to write home about... I hope the mpgs will come up a little as the engine settles in. Handles really well, smooth, quiet ride (which would probably improve quite a bit with better rubber). However, be prepared to sit in the dark, if you have the DVD installed - the interior light in the back does not do much for the front row - the front ones are for reading only!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I picked up the FWD drive version of this great car after looking at the Saturn VUE and Toyota RAV4. For all the standard features the other two couldn't compare. The VUE didn't have most of the saftety features available, and while the RAV4 did the price was substantially more. Even though we live in a snow-belt area, we've always been happy with our FWD sedan so we stuck with the FWD for our CUV mostly to save on fuel. The snow has fallen and, despite my best efforts, I can't get the FWD to do any sliding or slippping - and that's with the stock All-Seasons! Overall - this car is an excellent value for the money!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Besides all the saftey features (air bags galore, traction control, stability control), the best feature was one we weren't even aware when we purchased it. The hidden cargo compartment under the trunk area (5- seater only). This area is huge and impressive. The most practical feature I've seen.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased this car for my wife - who wanted a new car, but really only cared about looks. She really wanted the Lexus, but was out of our price range. Since our purchase, she is unbelievably happy. For that matter, so am I. The car drives great, handles decent, has a GREAT turning radius, with an easy to learn interior. I just hope the long-term owning experience is as pleasureable as the immediate. We opted not to get the sunroof - it seemed like it added substantial cabin noise while test driving. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Good all around car. We got a purchase price of 30% off MSRP. Because we got the discount, we chose to get all of the add on waranty crap at the end - not sure why, other than the bottom line still seemed like a great deal. We're happy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>You'll be tempted but DON'T Buy It. Value is relative and warranty is only as good as the Company. And that isn't so good. Mine has been in the shop hals as long as I ave owned it. Poor residual value and high operation costs significantly reduce perceived value. Sucks gas like a Hummer, poor ride-handling, partly due to junk Bridgestone Dueler tires. Very severe torque steer. The whole car is a set of trade offs. A lot of features, but all very poor quality. I will trade soon and eat the loss but be done with it. I'll stick with Honda or Toyota, or even GM is better.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in my 2002 Santa Fe for the 2007. 6 days after purchasing I was broadsided in drivers side door and front tire by a large landscape truck towing a trailer with lawn equipment going 45+mph who completely blew a red light. I was thrown into a bridge, cut out of the SUV and lived! I have every fireman I know who was at the accident stunned by my survival. They said if I didn't have that car I probably would not have lived. I suffered two broken vertebrae, broken sternum, internal bleeding and multiple contusions. Sounds bad, but could have been much worse. Needless to say, I am extremely happy with the safety features.......and it looked nice too. :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>This vehicle is an exceptional purchase in every way save for one key item, I only get 15.9 mpg in town. Though driving long distances this does get up to abut 23 mpg, I am very dismayed at this mileage. And yes, I do tend to have a heavier foot, but this is too low for a "smaller" SUV. One other small issue is a creaking noise in the cabin coming from the dashboard, maybe was put together too tight or something? Otherwise, everything else feels like a luxury SUV about this vehicle.

<TEXT>I have been watching the 2007 Santa Fe much of this year and have been impressed with the reviews, with Hyudai's company performance, and with the assembly plant in Alabama. After seeing one live and driving it, I was sold. My criteria for a vehicle was safety, comfort and quiet, looks, and lastly fun to drive (in that order). The Santa Fe satisfies all of these quite nicely. Our other vehicle is a Lexus RX350, and the SF holds it's own against it. The ride is smooth and it is extrememly quiet. Power is more than adequate for my needs. The fit and finish are great. The third row seats are much roomier and more comfortable that I had envisioned. They are super easy to get in and out of too.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The biggest surprise for me is how much fun the Santa Fe is to drive. I just love the feel of the car on the road. It turns on a dime and is plenty powerful enough. It gives me the feeling of control. This is the first car I've owned that really has it's own personality - and a great one!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 3 weeks I think this vehicle is terrific. Not a single complaint - it has plenty of pep, good looking, quality touches (small body gaps, plastics look good, refined dash panel, smooth lines), very quiet, high safety ratings, unbeatable value. The new design caught my eye. I approached skeptically as previous version was rough and noisy, but I was completely turned around after a test and research. Hwy mileage 25-27mpg (driving 75mph vs 55), and 17 in city traffic of Washington DC. About what I expected. This car is a keeper. Very comfortable city-hauler. My other car, which I bought new and still own after 16 years is a Lexus LS 400. Lexus, Hyundai is coming. No joke.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth, quiet and sufficiently powerful (speaking for 3.3 engine, but 2.7 isn't bad either). Lots of stuff included in base price. Sharp appearance - it has even turned a few heads among the oceans of competing cuv's. Excellent NHTSA ratings. Warranty is great and previous owners seem to agree.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>What a superb mid-size SUV. The styling is dynamite, inside and out. Very well engineered and it shows in the smallest of details. The build quality is awesome. I have not had one single problem or flaw since I purchased it. The ride is smooth and controlled and actually unbelievably good for a vehicle of this weight and size. There is absolutely no wind noise - even at 70 mph and the doors sound like a bank vault when they close. The attention to detail is indicative of a high-end Asian or German sedan. I'm delighted I made the right purchase decision on this SUV. I have owned 22 new vehicles in my life and can truly this one is the best. Try the new Santa Fe Limited!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The restyling of the vehicle is just the beginning of how incredible this vehicle is. It's very nice on the outside and (the Limited trim) comes with all the options a driver would really need for comfort, sophistication, pleasure and fun. The standard safety features (Electronic Stability Control, Traction Control System, ABS, air bags all around, Tire Pressure Monitoring System) are included in each level trim unlike other manufacturers who will often charge extra for such safety features. There are too many other standard features to list and any consumer would be surprised to see what the list is comprised of (available on the hyundaiusa.com website). Worth a look if not a purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The automatic temp control (dual front controls) w/ air quality system is great. I drove past a dead skunk and it automatically closed off the outside air and filtered out the smell. The standard stereo is more than enough for quality sound and the upgraded stereo is not necessary.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Traded-in 2002 model for new one. 2007 is so much better. Loaded model with everything except the third row seats (you get a really neat under floor storage system instead). Quiet inside with tons of comfort features. Good leather seats front and back. Not a barn burner re. performance but plenty of oomph for daily driving. Handling is sound and much improved over vagueness of previous model. Taking comfort in substantial safety features. MPG within EPA rating.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car looks great, but it might be overrated. I have only had my car for less than a month and I have to bring it in a second time for the engine light. The dealer keeps telling me it's not a problem, and then adds 40 miles to my car before giving it back. Towne Hyundai has a terrible service department. They pretty much told me to ignore the light unless it turns on again, and it's on again. Plus now when I drive it that smooth new car feeling is gone already. You can feel the car shifting into gear. Too bad they won't call me back to fix it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove the 2007 Toyota RAV4, Subaru RX-7, Subaru Tribeca and Mercury Mariner and was totally surprised that this vehicle was the nicest "cabin experience". I swore I would never buy a Hyundai but discovered the Santa Fe had the most value/price. It was similar to the Tribeca but $5000. less. The build quality is excellent and the warranty is outstanding. Have driven 1700 mi. so far and averaged 20.6 MPG (and regular gas is a plus---the Subarus required premium). Overall, this has been a delightful vehicle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased a Hyundai for my son 2 years ago and was very impressed with the value of the vehicle. I did not like the 2006 Sante Fe exterior but read that the 2007 was going to be a significant redesign. When I found phots of the 2007 I began to compare the Sante Fe to the Hondas and Toyotas. I think that the value for the price is not even a close comparison. I knew I wanted to purchase a new Sante Fe as soon as I was able to find the best price for the model and options I wanted. I like the ride and handeling, I like how quite the interior ride is, I think that most of the controls and features are well thought out and placed within reach of the driver and I really like the way it looks.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Dual temperature/climate controls. Steering wheel radio controls. Safety features, side airbags, ESC, AWD, and the ability to lock the drivetrain into AWD. Like the look and fit of the trim for both the interior and exterior. The lighted cup holders are a nice touch. The Warranty is awesome.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased a GLS 2.7 liter V6 model 2 weeks ago and I've never so enjoyed a new vehicle as much as this. It is the most comfortable, quiet, well-built, and generously appointed car in the way of standard features that I've ever owned(ESC, 4-wheel disc antilock, outstanding sound system, beautiful interior, very roomy, and very nice interior features and storage). It handles very well. Steering is very responsive with no slop and no body sway. Also getting 21 MPG city. Haven't done a trip yet to verify highway but it's rated at 27 highway which is pretty darn good for a 6. It's also built in Alabama so Hyundai is providing US jobs as well. This is a well-built car built in America. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very quiet ride. Little wind and road noise. Very comfortable seating and lots of leg room. Interior design and materials are top notch. The dash at night is eye-catching. It's an entry-level GLS but there is nothing chincy about this vehicle. Hyundai did their homework and this is one great car. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I looked at and drove many SUVs before I decided to drive a Santa Fe. Features that I thought were missing on other SUVs were standard on the SE such as day/night mirror, trip computer, CD/MP3 player, and a V6 engine. I originally was not looking at a Santa Fe because the previous design was not appealing to me at all. I only thought of driving the Santa Fe after test driving a Chevy Equinox at a dealership right next to a Hyundai dealership. I must say it was the best thing I could have done. The exterior redesign makes the new 2007 Santa Fe's a very attractive SUV. The interior design is not cluttered and very usable. Hyundai is certainly doing well in their assault on Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our first Hyundai and it will not be the last. We are very impressed with the 2007 Hyundai Santa Fe. What drew us to the car were the standard safety features. Then when we drove it, we couldn't wait to get it home. It is smooth, comfortable and fun to drive. We looked at the 2006 Santa Fe and we weren't that impressed. The 2007 is an overhaul of not just the outside, but the inside. Great value for the money and the Santa Fe is easy on the wallet regarding gas. On ten gallons of gas, strictly city driving, we went 230 miles. I highly recommend this SUV. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had a 2006 Tucsan, and really had no problems with that vehicle. When I was researching the Tucsan,in January, 2006, I saw that the Santa fe was being redesigned and would be out in the summer. I liked it, but didn't want to wait. Well, I love the Tucsan, but test drove the Santa Fe, and I was hooked. I was fortunate enough to pay cash for the Tucsan, and did not lose much on the trade in. So, I got a very luxurious car, and a very small payment. I love this SUV. It is beautiful, and the ride is sweet!</TEXT>

My first Hyundai was the hatchback excell in '93, then newly intriduced Elantra in '94, another Elantra in '99 and now the newly redesigned 2007 Santa Fe. I LOVE IT. I still have the '99 Elentra, and with over 117K miles it is still going strong. I have no complaints about the Santa Fe and my friends thought it was a lexus when I first showed it to them. It is very stylish, and well put together. Kudos to Hyundai and their team. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Never thought I would own a Hyundai but thought I might look at End-of-Year deals on 2006 model. Brand new 2007 still in srink wrap caught my eye. The 2007s arrived the day before so I got to try one. Bought it the next day. Loved it ever since. Tried Honda CRV (Too noisy, slow and cheap looking) and Pilot (nice, but pricy and a bit too big). If Hyundai proves reliable over time, then Watch Out Honda! There's a new game afoot. My eldest daughter(37) thought it was a new Acura SUV. My youngest daughter(25) wanted to go out and replace her 2005 Santa Fe immediately.</TEXT>

<TEXT> Dear Sirs, I was also the owner of the previous model of Hyundai Santa Fe for 6 years without any problems, and I will say only that the new model 2007 of Santa Fe really presents the huge step forward and is completely comparable to Japanese and European SUVs. Recently it was comparably tested with Volkswagen Tuareg by Auto-Bild in Germany and both have been completely equalized. With my compliments ! Boris B from Slovenia P.S. Owing to the fact that I could not choose the right style as you do not offer the diesel motor 2.2 CDRi / 150 HP, I have signed the first one on the your list !</TEXT>

While most of the reviews I read were no doubt written by genuine owners, some I feel might be written by some with hidden malicious intents. I carefully examined some purpported issues forwarned, most turned out to be unfounded. I owned a 2001 CRV; my wife has a 2004 CRV, these cannot compare with the quality, ride, value and amenity of the SF. I cannot be happier with my new acquisition. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Hyundai has continued to build more stylish vehicles, improve quality, and keep prices reasonable. This suv compares in options to the more expensive Lexus and Acura, but at a more reasonable price. Of course, its not equal in quality , materials, and status as the forementioned. Safety is the main concern for me. This suv is filled with safety devices from the air bags to the drivetrain. I'm waitng for the side impact crash results. The one area of concern is the very long stopping distance. I'm cinfident Hyundai will correct this problem.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>What an attractive suv. Not too extreme in appearance, just right for me, conservative but stylish. It steering is tight and the power is sufficient. It's fun to drive.

<TEXT>First, thank you Edmunds.com for your awesome video review on this vehicle. I watched it and went directly to the nearest dealer and test drove it. I was so impressed with the look and overall quality of the car, that I bought it on the spot. We got an 07 Ltd with just a sun roof, white pearl paint, and floor mats as options. The list of standard features is so long and impressive that I was blown away. This vehicle is built very well too. It feels as tight and handles as well as my old ML 430. It's got a wonderful solid feel on the road. The turning radius is amazing. The creature comforts are beyond good. I am still in shock that a vehicle this nice can be sold for this price. AWESOME!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior design is gorgeous. The interior is sharp with easy to reach controls. It's very comfortable to drive. The tightness of the car and the fit and finish are very high quality.

<TEXT>I've owned my Santa Fe for a little over a week now. I've been very pleased with how the car handles. Has very good ride. The exterior and interior designs is clean and modern, much nicer than the Toyota highlander and Honda Pilot in my opinion. I'm currently getting 20mpg (mostly city driving). I recently took a 4.5 hour trip (mostly highway) and was getting about 23mpg. The steering wheel controls are spread too far apart and difficult to get use to as they are very low on the wheel.

<TEXT>Hyundai's first US designed and manufactured model is awesome. I have people thinking this is the Infiniti FX35 or the Acura MDX when they look at it from different angles! I have the arctic white 2.7L engine with the automatic/sportronic transmission. This car has enough power with this engine to do what it needs to do, carry my wife and my baby with space for the stroller/etc in the cargo area. Great looks inside and out. People think this is a luxury car whenever they see it, since it has great interior(wood grain trimming, fake aluminim trimming, and dual color dashboard/interior). Second row has its own storage(floor shelves, backseat pockets) and air conditioning! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the storage areas make me think of Toyota. Great interior looks. Great safety features, too much to list here. My 2.7L gets 21/26 mpg. I'm getting 21mpg with moderate use of my A/C on an even combination of city/hwy use. This SUV is great! Way to go Hyundai!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The exterior design is eye-catching and attractive. The insrumentation is easy to learn and easy to read. The brakes feel good. All of the doors sound 'solid and secure' when they are closed. It handles very nicely, and easier to park than our old Tahoe. Time will tell of the reliability.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First Hyundai. Nothing but Toyota's last 15 years. The Santa Fe had, better styling, more interior room, especially with the third row seats, and a better overall value. We got a limited loaded, including leather and sunroof and third row seating for about what we would have paid for a basic Highlander. We love the Santa Fe. Two years and 40k miles. Some issues, paint chips too easy, slight hesitation in the transmission, especially when going from reverse to drive, rt rear door weatherstrip came loose, Front interior lighting didn't come on with doors, my neighbors 08 did, dealer took care of it by adding an update which was great. 20/24 mpg. Fun to drive. Larger 3.3 is better choice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive, great styling, nice stance, especially with larger 18" tires and spoiler, nice interior, comfortable seats,ride, plenty of room in the third row compared to others, Split folding seats great when you have six but need more cargo room, good highway mileage after break in, 24 to 25 mpg.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We traded in our 2002 Santa Fe Limited for this one after checking Toyota and Honda. We get about 20 mpg over all in the summer and 23-24 over all mpg on long trips, about what they predicted. The only draw backs we have found are that the right rear seat belt buckle will not come out of the seat hole far enough to get it buckled up. The cruise control is to slow to respond so you can drop 5 to 7 mph on inclines before you get back up to speed (frustrating for the people following you). Hyundai does not have a fix for these and maybe nobody else has these problems as I haven't see it listed before. We still love the car and would buy another.</TEXT>

I also have had my check engine light on several times and the last time it was blinking. I have had the fuel pump replaced in it also. I had to have knew tires at 22,000 miles because it was out of lined. I bought the car with 8000 miles on it and I feel that this was a damaged program car!

<TEXT>We tested a lot of medium SUV's, and we finally chose this car for it's style and value. The road noise is pleasantly quiet for a car of this type. The thermometer and compass (both standard equipment) were big pluses. We strongly recommend the larger (3.3L) V6 engine for its better acceleration and handling. The Santa Fe has been a joy to drive. It feels more like a car than a SUV. Our gas mileage has been 20.5 mpg in combined city/hwy driving. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the Santa Fe in Nov. '07 and all was great. When the weather started to warm up and we used the A/C it would only work when it wanted too. Took it in to the dealer and they couldn't guarantee that they had fixed it. Have had it in six times and they still can't find the source of the problem. On the fifth time they kept it for almost one month. The sixth time was last week, picked it up and within one hour the A/C wouldn't work. Have been in contact with Hyundai about a replacement car since this one now falls under the category of a lemon but they have been slow to respond. Other than the A/C problem the car is great.</TEXT>

Smooth ride, good acceleration. Powerful A/C as needed here in AZ. Now my neighbor who rides to work with me wants one! If I continue to be this pleased, would do it again in a heartbeat.

<TEXT>23,000 flawless miles! Well almost. It's only been back to the dealer once after about 2000 miles to reset the check engine light. It hasn't come back on since. Also, the auto climate control got stuck on 68 degree outdoor temp and they fixed that. There's a TSB on it. Since that time all I've done is change the oil. I also pull a 3000 lb small travel trailer with it occasionally. Pulls it great. Very stable. MPG with trailer is 10-13. MPG without trailer= city 17-18 / Hwy 22-25. The best mpg I ever got was a long trip locked on cruise on a fairly flat road going 65 to 72 mph max. It averaged 25.6. On the trip back I went 75-80 and it got 23.5. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Hyundai Santa Fe is a wonderful compact SUV, that drives like a car, but is extremely versatile. My SF has 3rd row seats so that I can seat up to 7 passengers, unbelievable! Also, if I have 2 with car seats and one older child I can put one car seat in the back and still have the other backseat down (split folding seats in the 3rd row) which is great for cargo. This vehicle is smooth and the interior is beautiful. The industrial design of the interior is so much better then the cheap plastic of Toyota RAV4 or Honda CRV. The interior is very classy and the V6 engine is powerful yet gas efficient. I have 12k miles on my 2007 SF and am getting 24 mpg per tank on 50% hwy & 50% city drivin</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Looks, mileage, interior, engine, XM Radio, this SUV is a dream to drive and extremely versatile if you need to carry multiple kids, but still need space for cargo.

<TEXT>This new 07 Santa Fe will never be confused with previous years Santa Fe's. With it's upscale styling and car like ride this cross over vehicle offers many standard features you wouldn't expect in a Hyundai. My neighbor asked if I just bought a Lexus when I pulled my new Santa Fe into my driveway. He was shocked when I told him it was a Hyundai. The milage figres listed are 19 city & 24 highway. To date, my milage has been less. The owners manual suggested after 1200 miles the motor will be broken in so to speak. I'm hoping for better gas milage down the road. I would suggest anyone looking for a mid sized SUV to seriously consider th 07 Santa Fe.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Car is new but already has shown good manners. Eye height is high, a feature we wanted. Entry and exit is easy, a feature we demanded. Full list of safety features was absolutely essential.

<TEXT>We selected the Limited for the package creature comforts. I made my decision based on comfort for my 6'4" height. Have found the ride smooth yet agile, and braking response is excellent. Interior has good ergonomic display, the fit and finish is rich rivaling many upscale players in this market. We chose not to have third row seating, rather have the ample storge, including the hidden compartment in back. Selecting platinum sage paint with grey leather allows the vehicle to stay cooler in the heat of summer. Tinted rear glass helps for both security and interior temps. Observing an average 22-24 mpg we are pleased with the fuel economy. At six months one word: Awesome.</TEXT>

Accord has 251k miles and we expect the Hyundai will be kept that long as well. We have GLS w/FWD, 2.7L, A/C, Shiftronic and XM radio... hard to imagine needing more in an SUV. At 13k miles, we avg 24 MPG (40% city/60% hwy driving w/ air always on). Great suspension much like the MB ML320; decent engine torque like the BMW 2.5L inline-6; class-leading interior like 07 Audi A6. No problems so far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I bough my SUV i had been researching and looking for a new car for approximately 5 months. I decided I really wanted an SUV, and the newly designed Santa Fe was the first to catch my eye. My family was skeptical because everyone thought Hyundai was a not so great brand of car. They were wrong!!! With the warranty, I decided to give it a go. I have had my car for 15 months and it was an awesome purchase!! No problems whatsoever and it drives like a car, which is something I was looking for. I wasn't so sure about my beige interior either, but in my black car, it looks very classy... like myself! The only thing I would change would be to offer a sunroof package with all the models!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife and I spent 2-3 months researching the purchase of a new vehicle to replace our worn-out Dodge Caravan minivan. Final decision came down to the Santa Fe and Toyota Rav4. The Santa Fe won primarily on the greater "bang for our buck", the Rav4 interior felt cheap compared to the Santa Fe. The Santa Fe has more than adequate power. The ride is smooth and quiet. The interior is well thought out and comfortable. The exterior styling is attractive, but not "over- done". This vehicle is a pleasure to drive. I will have to see how reliability will be over time, but Hyundai's great warranty helps with piece of mind in that area. </TEXT>

Oddly enough, most people compare this vehicle to Lexus, Honda Pilot, Acura and Toyota Highlander, all considerably more expensive vehicles. The Santa Fe, similarly equipped, is still priced lower than RAV 4 and CRV, which are both less substantial vehicles. Hyundai is a company that in a short period of time, has listened to it's customers and actually built cars people want at an affordable price.

I was trying to convince myself that I really wanted the new Honda CRV,but the road noise was so bad and the ride so uncomfortable, that I was not happy with it. The Rav4 wasn't impressing me either. Then I drove the Santa Fe, fully expecting that I wouldn't care for it. Well, was I wrong. I was sold the moment I drove it off the lot for the test drive. It was so smooth, so comfortable, so quiet.

<TEXT>I love the look and style of my Sante Fe, hate the poor mileage, and have had a series of different, nagging little problems (related to assembly/quality, affecting safety) that have it in the shop WAY too frequently for a new car that is supposed to rival Honda/Toyota quality! The biggest issue is that the turn signal switch stopped working reliably after about 4 months, and the dealer has not yet been able to fix the problem after 3 tries/3 months - it's very dangerous to suddenly find onself unable to signal a turn/lane change, particularly in poor weather! Also, seat belt tensioners in the second row were not installed properly, and did not work at all. Fun to drive, when it's working!</TEXT>

<TEXT>We replaced a 2002 Toyota Highlander with the 2007 Santa Fe and have not regretted our choice. The new restyled Highlander would have been $8K more than the Santa Fe for the same features. The V6 powertrain on our Limited is smooth, quiet, and powerful and would make you think you are in a $50K Lexus. Overall features and quality appear to be top notch. Another family member has a 2003 Santa Fe (old body style) and has had a great experience. The only criticism is that the standard stereo (w/XM) on the Limited is somewhat weak, to get the upgraded Infiniti system you have to also get the rear entertainment system (DVD) which with no kids we don't need. Perhaps this is changed for 2008.</TEXT>

Fit and finish exceeded our expectations, our neighbor owns a Lexus RX330, I feel our Santa Fe matches the Lexus across the boards. Just a great value, Hyundai has definetly stepped up their game. We were initially scared to buy the Santa Fe because it was a "Hyundai", after one year, NO REGRETS, Great purchase!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We bought the "Limited FWD", and the Interior is extremely upscale and Posh for a 27k vehicle. Smooth and quiet ride, very good MPGs for the size. Very nice looking S.U.V. Perfect reliablility so far (14,000 miles). Stereo is very nice for stock, decent bass, with warm highs, we love it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Other than the front seat bottoms,which need to be about two inches longer, my wife and I are happy with the car. Very quiet interior-easy to have a normal conversation at highway speeds (windows up, of course). Don't care for the "proprietary" XM radio. The logo will be there rather you activate or not. And true, the 18" wheels seem to contribute to a little harsher ride on rough roads.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It was very hard to get the Santa Fe optioned as I wanted,I waited 8 months for one as close as poss.Now that I have been driving it almost a year I can say it was worth the wait.Its a fast truck that drives very well and has a controlled ride.The interior is black leather with graphite metallic exterior..Way cool.I have every option but the 3rd row.I looked at Honda,Toyota,Infiniti,Mazda and a few of the over priced premium brands,only to find a vehicle with far to many short comings.Even at 35,000.00 it had way more than they offered...and I saved thousands.I would buy it again only this time with Black int/ Black ext.Its a great truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Some of my favorite features are the 605 watt Infinity/DVD surround sound system,It rocks!The seats are very comfy on trips and the rear under floor storage areas are great for hiding lots of stuff.Blue dash lights are great.Oh yea the headlights are excellent...great beam pattern. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I stated looking for a mid-size SUV, I narrowed down the choices to Rav4, Highlander, and Santa fe. I'm so stoked that I drove the Santa fe first and last, I was sold and the warranty/pricing and craftmanship was icing on the cake. I have had it for 8 months and have over 25K already, mostly highway miles, and I get an unbelievable 25 MPH on Hwy and average 22 in the city. So if your dreaming Bout a midsized Suv, look no farther then the Santa fe</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned 3 Santa Fe's and would buy another if they keep improving. I purchased the 2007 last May and drove it to California and back in June. The ride was fine, gas mileage was and still is 22 in city and highway. The only problem that I had was a blow out in Colorado. Try finding a 17 inch tire on a Saturday morning. I am now stuck with a top of the line Michelin that had to be replaced by the stock tire for the vehicle when I got home. I would recommend Hyundai vehicles to any one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this vehicle in september 2006 and have over 20,000 miles on it so far. For an SUV with a V6 I can say it is pretty good on gas (overall 22 MPG). Still drives like a car and is very quiet on the road. I live in Massachusetts and my wife has never had any issues driving in the snow (we live in the second hilliest city in the US). I don't have any interior failures or defects as stated in other reports. I can honestly say that I have no complaints with this SUV and was looking at the Pilot and highlander also at the time. I wish I had purchased the 3rd row seat.</TEXT>

I called customer service several times and was given a file number and name to call. every time I called I was given a new contact person (5 times) Dealer said the reason for poor fuel mileage was that i was not using the right oil.

<TEXT>I'm not sure about long trips due to the seats. They're nice with the heated leather, but you can feel the short bottoms/lack of thigh support. It doesn't seem like much until you make a long drive and you go numb! Cool how the rear seats have adjustable recline, though. Nice storage section under rear cargo area. Excellent ride quietness. You can have a regular conversation in this thing w/o raising your voice! Traded in an Elantra GT, so I'm used to the blue dash lighting. The projector type headlights make for an "upscale" feel.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car based on a "promise". And now I can tell you that I am very happy I went in this direction. Wow! Drive it and you will buy it. Solid, comfortable and quiet. Plenty of "get up and go", nicely appointed interior and plenty of storage. Handling in the snow is fantistic. I had considered the CR-V and the RAV4 and after driving each one, before buying the Santa Fe, there is just no question of which is best. I was hoping for a little bit better gas mileage. After about 3000 miles I am getting 21.1 MPG. Not the worst!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Did a lot of research and comparison shopping before purchasing our Santa Fe. So far, we just love it. It handles great (have driven in snow, on ice, on highway, heavy traffic, etc.), and it is fun to drive. The small turning radius is better than any other car I have driven. I was skeptical about buying a Hyundai, but am extremely happy with my decision. Gas mileage is better than advertised. It has good power and feels very safe.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I switched from a Toyota Highlander to the SantaFe. In many respects, the two cars are very similar and so far I have no regrets. The Highlander had grown to large for me, along with price. With the SantaFe I am averaging 22-23 mpg on the road and 16-17 in the city. The only issue with 1400 miles is the console cover around the shifter continues to pop loose. Minor issue and yet to go back to the dealer</TEXT>

<TEXT>Owned me Santa FE Limited V6 AWD for 7 months now and love it more than when I bought it. Gets great reviews from all that see or ride in it. Its smooth quiet ride amazes me. Everything about it is smooth and quiet. Gas mileage at 20.5 for a V6 AWD is excellant as far as I'm concerned. One trip thru upstate New York got me 24mpg with cruise at 74. Yes leather seats could be a bit longer, softer, and lower, but with every car out there no matter the price there has to be trade offs. Quality and workmanship appear at this time to be above average, especially compared to my Ford Escape traded in. Did compare the Santa Fe to Nisson Murano, Mazada CX7 & CX9, Ford Edge Sel Plus.</TEXT>

Cargo room is huge without having a giant vehicle, it's very comfortable, drives like a car, and feels very safe on the highway. Get great gas mileage, even with mostly city miles. Road trips get over 300 miles per tank. Compared to other SUVs with the same features and safety, it was so much more affordable. I'd buy it again!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Santa Fe has aggressively kept up with the competition. This is my third Santa Fe, and while I admired the original version (even the quirky styling), there is no question but that the new version is a significant improvement. I am amazed at how well- thought out it is, in general, through the superb use of materials to small details, such as the slight driver?s side tilt to the center console stack. Look and ?tactile? feel (other than a few too many hard surfaces) is very up-scale; I even find the firm seats ?just right.? Power is ample and smooth, and the base stereo works well. Bravo Hyundai!</TEXT>

Gas mileage is not that great but I knew that going in.

The style, interior comfort, ride/performance, etc. are great. Did a lot of research prior to purchase and took test drives of Honda and Toyota. Both were nice but couldn't compare with the Santa Fe. Dealership folks were super to work with too. Haven't had much of an opportunity to judge the mileage but anticipate it will be considerably better than the M- B.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our AWD Santa Fe Ltd. in June, 2007. We looked at Mistubishis, Hondas and Toyotas as comparison mid sized suv's. No comparison. When looking we didn't think we needed the third row seats. But, we have used them several times. They come in handy. They disappear when not used. Large, flat storage area available for Costco trips when the back seats are down. This vehicle is very quiet. Hard to hear the engine running. Many user friendly features. Very well finished, attractive interior. Amazing price for what you get. Extra long warranty means peace of mind. After six months and 5,000 miles nothing has gone wrong. Everything works fine. Highly recommend this vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Before almost buying 1yr old used Nissan Murano, i made sure i tested a few others - namely the RAV4, Compass, and Santa Fe (SF). I prefer new, but i also loved the styling and handling of the Murano - so i was torn. The SF competed in almost every way. I was surprised it drove as responsively as the Nissan and had lots of features you'd expect in a more expensive car, . Even my Highlander-driving father was impressed. 8 months later it's still been a good choice.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It depends on ones perception on what you want in a suv This is not a touring car as built. It;s more a commuter or running around car. Great design, well built, solid. smooth transmission and engine, plenty of pop on the high end. Lacks power on the low end, mainly because of gearing. Well laid out controls. Hyundai tryed to think of everthing possible to make this a good suv. It falls short in these areas. center coucil to high to short.causes arm fatigue and elbow soreness. arm rests not padded enough. front buckets to stiff. suspension to stiff and has a truck like ride on uneven pavement. some body roll on corners.good on highway but seems to float a bit.needs more floor sound proofing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Like a lot of people wrote, this is my first Hyundai. I had a 04 CRV w/ 91K miles & wanted something a little bigger w/ a V-6 for towing. I bought this Santa Fe used for $19,800 w/ 7500 miles & had them add nice leather seat and door covers for $900. Got $9000 trade for my CRV which also needed $1500 put into it so this was a deal I couldn't pass on. I drive 2/3 high & 1/3 city. Averaged 26 mpg w/ my CRV & so far I'm getting 23 avearge with the SF & 3.3L engine. I drive pretty conservative, use the cruise & avoid hard braking & starts. A friend's wife has the same CRV & she only averaged 20 mpg because she had terrible driving habits. What a quiet smooth drive too!!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I also looked at all the other SUV's and would have paid at least $3K more for anything comparable.
