<TEXT>Overall is a great car don't get me wrong. im been an BMW enthusiast for years but the dealer can't fix the wear of the rear tires on the inside. They want me to do alignment and put new set of tires at 22000 miles at my expense! Thats the reason i purchased a $80,000 car on the first place, insane.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car is an excellent piece of engineering (except for the rear suspension)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I looked at every "similar" vehicle - Porsche 911 and Cayman, SL-Class - but just couldn't find the right fit. I am so pleased with my decision! The car has enough "sporty-ness" to feel like a performance car, but without the harshness or diminutive stature of so many other "sports cars" (I'm 6'3" and 250 lbs). To say that it is in a class of its own is too trite, but there really isn't anything comparable. Thus far it's been a whole lot of fun. I'll let you know what long-term ownership is like.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Substantial agility despite its size. Unparallelled fit and finish. Unbelievable technology throughout the vehicle.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>For months I had been test-driving different cars looking for "the one." Porsche 911, BMW 335i and 135i, Mini, Audi and even the Volvo C70. In my opinion, nothing else comes close in terms of the whole package. This is a sexy car that flies, turns and brakes on command. I just came out of a 530i and at 6'00, 250 lbs., I am more comfortable in the 650i. Smooth and quiet, powerful yet reserved -- until summoned.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound of the exhaust, head-up display, comfortable sport seats, park assist, smooth and responsive acceleration, legendary BMW braking.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The BMW 650i is not what I expected. This is NOT a sports car. It is an overpriced "sporty" sedan. The manual transmission is awful. The navigation system is worse. The car handles well for a sedan. Acceleration from zero is not great, but it does have a great deal of power from 30 mph to 100 mph</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior styling is great. The convertible roof is quick and seamless.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've owned a lot of great cars (i.e. Porsches, BMW M3s, etc.) but this car is the "complete package". The styling is gorgeous, great performance, superb handling and decent mileage for a V8! And if that's not enough, it's a convertible with 1 button control. I love this car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance, styling and handling. iDrive is easy to learn. Creature comforts abound.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is NOT a sports car. It is a "sporty" two-sedan. The manual transmission is very disappointing. The car corners well, but is not very quick 0-60 mpg. However, it does well getting on the freeway (30-70mph) It does not compare very favorably to a 911 Porsche, but it competes well with the SL 500 Mercedes.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It is fun and comfortable to to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The 650 has what BMW calls an "inherent characteristic." If you drive in "manual" shift mode the vehicle is prone to stuttering when coming to a stop. Imagine your head bobbing back and forth like a doll on the dashboard. The vehicle is also prone to severe lunges when driving in m1 (such as you might in a parking garage looking for a spot or while moving forward in a metered freeway on ramp) and to a lesser extent in automatic. The lunges are dangerous and you must drive defensively at 4 miles per hour. BMW states the problem is with the software-it thinks the engine is stalling and the computer gives the engine throttle. BMW won't fix the problem. Stay away from this vehicle. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>But for the severe problems I have noted the vehicle is fun to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is a great touring vehicle. Very refined, comfortable and easy to gain speed. In a sense, this car is too good for American roads as it truly comes to its life and purpose at 130-150 mph, which is absolutely illegal in states. It effectively replaces a small airplane in Europe and loses much of its value stateside.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have now owned my 2007 650i convertible for 8 months. Being a longstanding BMW enthusiast, I traded in my 2004 M3 convertible, a car that I truly loved. With the 650i, you get M3 neck-snapping acceleration with a more luxurious ride and interior. The iDrive, although a pain at first, is actually pretty neat. Go for the options: nav, Sirius, comfort access, bigger tires. What's a few extra bucks at this point? This car will make everyone take a second look, especially when you're effortlessly passing them at 110 mph. This Beauty is a Beast!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine, fast-operating convertible top, handling, Sirius, navigation, sleek sexy exterior, free maintenance.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is a hot rod with the comforts of the 750i. I look forward to waking every morning and driving this car... great fun.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great style and lines. The "giddy-up" and stereo sound system is top notch. Nice to have an iPod adapter built into the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The second day I drove this car down a two lane road with the top down listining to the purr of the engine I was filled with satisfaction that I'd made the right choice. WOW! What a beast.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The lines and style are wonderful. All the negative press regarding the iDrive is ridiculous. I have an S550 and the BMW is at least as intuitive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Unmistakable German engineering. Handling excellent for a car this size, but not as easy to corner aggressively as with a 911 and its "oversteer" which makes any turn at any speed effortless. This is more a touring car and less a sports car. Very comfortable and manageable interior. The iDrive is very easy to learn and use. Sport package, comfort access and heads-up (I do not have HUD) a must. You can't see the speedometer or tach when cornering which is a distraction when pressing the car around turns. Overall a very impressive and formidable automobile. Not quite the Ultimate Driving Machine, but an excellent stand-in. A 911 is a 911, period.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling. This car is very good looking with the top up or down. Looks like a muscle car but way to refined to be categorized as such. Excellent power and torque for a car this size. Comfortable seating and storage capacity. The iDrive with voice activation is very intuitive and easy to use. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Drove it on the Autobahn after European delivery in Munich all the way to Vienna - awesome power, handling and comfort. Navigation and heads up display took me right to my Vienna hotel. Car is great fun to drive and a real head turner - would strongly recommend 3/4 hours with the iDrive manual in order to fully appreciate it, particularly if used in conjunction with the steering wheel controls. Trunk handles two golf bags and rear seat is definitely functional. Heads up display and sports package a must as is upgraded stereo system. Very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this vehicle and also the European Delivery program - BMW does it right. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Went for a drive in the country last weekend and all I can say is WOW! Car was rock solid at 110 and when passing a car it was still pushing me back in the seat at 80. Has all the torque you would ever need. Soft leather seats and a well laid out interior. The exhaust rumble make you want to drive it. This car is a keeper.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powerful styling and comfort at speed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my 2nd BMW 650i I had purchased 2/2/2007. I traded my 2006 650i coupe for a 2007 650i convertible. Since the sun roof did not slide back on the coupe I got the convertible instead. I am very happy and pleased with the convertible. This car has the perfect package: comfort, luxury, handling, performance, agility, and beauty inside & out. The color of mine is Alpine white with the new upgraded leather beige. Mine came fully equipped with all options except HD radio, which you cannot have if you have the real-time traffic for the navigation. This is an awesome feature to have. iDrive is not difficult to use, as long as you are willing to learn! People stop complaining!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I prefer to use the voice recognition to input destination for the navigation. Makes it easier and safe while driving. I like the iPod adapter, bluetooth, comfort access, active cruise control, head-up display, and the night vision is pretty cool to use in back roads/country roads.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Although I've only had my 650i for a week or so, I am already impressed with the quality and feel of such a high performance, luxury coupe. It has plenty of power and very stable handling. My last car was an '05 Porsche Carrera. This BMW is much more luxurous and as much fun to drive without all of the bumps of a much stiffer suspension. Beautiful lines, classy interior, and the iDrive isn't at all that hard to use once I spent some time with it. I'm very pleased with my choice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling and looks, very classy car, inside and out.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased a 2007 650i convertible one week ago and here are my initial comments. The iDrive was easier to learn then I expected and, though working, the radio is certainly more complicated then having a couple of buttons, still the iDrive gives you access to many sophisticated features. That said, my wife, who owns a 2002 BMW 535, will not replace that car with another BMW if it has an iDrive which is too complex for her to operate. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The performance of the car is superb and the car handles beautifully even though it is not a light-weight. The fit and finish is tops.</FAVORITE>
