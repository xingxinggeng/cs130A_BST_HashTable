<TEXT>The wife and I bought one of the original '07 FJs back in March, and we love it. So far it's running perfectly. Up to 40,000 miles, and still not one problem (knock on wood), just as I expect from Toyota. Great truck. Incredibly fun to drive. Handles remarkably well for an SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It's a love-it-or-hate-it look. I love it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just sold my 2007 FJ. The interior is very well designed. Everything was ergonomically correct and easy to grasp (with the big knobs). As many owners on here, I bought the FJ because it was different. I grew tired of the vehicle after a while. Very basic interior and slightly rough ride. Not the FJ's fault. It is not supposed to be a luxury car! In three years of ownership, not one day in the shop. Great build quality. Bad gas mileage...like driving a brick down the road.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very nice Stereo/Subwoofer. Build Quality. Size of control knobs.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I admit it, I bought the FJ Cruiser not because of the offroad capability , but because I thought it was cool. After owning it for more than a year and 24,000 miles, it has proven to be an incredible vehicle that will do just about everything and go anywhere. It's not a race car and you can't fly around corners, but it's a solid vehicle that doesn't rattle, shake or shimmy like my past 6 GM SUVS have done starting at 30,000 miles. It has a blind spot, get ready to look around it. That's my only complaint. It gets 22 on the highway which is respectable for a 4x4 SUV. If you are looking for a solid SUV that won't break down all of the time and won't depreciate then look no further.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My wife chose the FJ and loved driving it with our two young kids. It is easy to take them in and out of the back seat with the side-opening doors. We have the airbag package and it feels like they are in a vault. It has a hard, bumpy ride - as it should be, because this is no grocery- getter. This vehicle is absolutely no-nonsense and reliable, at 30,000 mi. with no issues, and none anticipated. Recently hauled three other guys for a mountain-climbing trip and the four of us were comfortable. One owns a new Jeep and lamented all the problems he is having already. We love this vehicle with no reservations and expect our kids to drive it when they turn 16 in about ten years.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned 20+ cars, SUV's, trucks. This has to be one of my 2 favorites (together with my 911 cabriolet). As another reviewer said - you can buy fancier, much more expensive SUV's. But you can't buy one that's more fun to own, that people ask you about, that is this reliable, that can go anywhere. I bought one of the first ones in CT - Voodoo Blue - and have not had a single issue. My wife, 3 kids, dog & I all still love it just as much as new. Sure - it has a few compromises like rear visibility. Show me any great car with real personality that doesn't. And this is very practical (easy to clean, acceptable MPG, great in bad weather...) and fun to own! Now that's value!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I went to a Used Car Dealership that sold mainly Dodges. I saw this cool looking truck and learned it was called the FJ Cruiser. I test drove it and fell in love with it immediately for it's looks and above average handling for an SUV ! However, the clutch "chirps" when at idle but stops when the clutch is depressed. I had the dealership replace the clutch disc, pressure plate and throwout bearing. All was well until 2 months and 1400 miles later and the same problem arose again. I learned through Toyota forums that this is an issue with manual tranny FJ's but they still operate normally as they should. Despite this somewhat major annoyance, I love my FJ and don't regret buying it! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Unique styling, doesn't look like your neighbor's F150 or Jeep. Rubber floor mats (easy cleanups, yeah!) and easy to use heater, A/C controls. Handles quite well in sharp turns, surprising for a truck/SUV. Gutsy engine especially with the manual tranny=much driving fun! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My need for a good solid truck rules out many of the vehicles made today. I spend as much time as I can at a remote family cabin and exploring the outdoors and often am very far from any type of assistance. My vehicle needs to get me in and out, and this one always comes through. I put Goodyear MTR's on it and they are top notch. I have had this vehicle in rain, mud, sand, and lots of snow. It plows through everything without trouble. There may be more luxurious 4x4's out there, but I see lots of those stuck in snow banks while the Cruiser keeps on trucking. If you go off road at all, the front skid plate is not an option. While comfortable on the road, it can be tricky to drive at times.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Build quality, reliability, and its off road ability and dependability. It's nice to know there isn't much that this truck can't get over or through. Being waved through inspection stations during blizzards and not having to stop is nice. Getting to places at the cabin other vehicles cant go is nice.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Maybe you?re wondering why such an odd- looking SUV became my next toy after driving a 2006 Range Rover Sport Supercharged. Rather than choosing another luxury SUV, I went for something different ? the total opposite! A bare bones waterproofed scuba suit-covered seating, Rubbermaid flooring w/ all-weather cargo mats & an interior w/ a harmonious blend of nylon, plastic, rubber & metal. Only 3,200 TRD units were made & I was fortunate enough to have #100. I was always fond of the Toyota Racing Development (TRD) team since childhood & this was one way of driving one of their latest creations, just wished I could do it at the Baja but nevertheless, it is fun to drive anywhere.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The all-black treatment & added TRD features that make it stand out from the rest of the pack. Music coming from the ceiling since it is one of the first production cars using flat- panel speakers. Don?t expect comfort since it is built like a truck, hence, the stiff & sporty ride. Take it anywhere!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I live in Alberta so the roads are black ice for 8 months of the year and it handles awesome. You have to force it to slide out in 4 wheel drive. I can drive through 2 feet of snow and not even get close to stuck. I've driven big trucks before so believe me when I say there are no blind spots, just learn to use your mirrors and you can see the whole road, your 6 feet off the ground. Good power, I would like a v8 in it but the v6 doesn't fall far behind. Haven't had trouble fitting 5 guys and hockey bags in the back driving for over an hour. Light enough not to get stuck in mud all the time unlike older Toyota's. If you can drive, you will love this SUV, beats a pick up any day.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Upgraded suspension makes gravel roads feel like free ways. Satisfying sound from the exhaust. AUX port is awesome for long road trips if you have any type of mp3 or portable dvd. Tows my seadoo's and quads like there not there. Rides so smooth. Atrack isn't necessary but helps a lot when stuck.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well, I needed a vehicle that could tow my trailer of two sport bikes but didn't want a truck. When I saw the FJ, I loved it! When I drove it, I had to have it. The motor has sufficient power to do what you need to do. The suspension is great and was pleasantly surprised on how well it handled. The interior is roomy. However, at close to $30k, it lacks a few amenities that I wish it had, i.e., heated seats, heated side mirrors, sunroof, etc. Mileage is horrible but all in all, it's a great vehicle and fun to drive! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I like how it drives and handles. There are major flaws in the craftmanship though. The sun visors are so small they have no purpose. The stereo system is lacking. The roof rack is weak and I busted two supports already since they're made of cheap plastic. The engine is powerful and it is a lot of fun to drive. But the gas mileage stinks.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the FJ Cruiser after having driven a fully loaded Ford Explorer for the past 8 years. It's my first foreign car and so far I'm very pleased with it (only has about 1000 miles on it at this time). I've gotten about 20 MPG on the first 3 tanks of gas with about 50/50 city/highway driving. The ride feels tall but handles well and is quieter than you'd expect for a vehicle that looks this tough and is so utilitarian. I test drove the smaller Rav4 and Honda CR-V as well as the Honda Pilot and Ridgeline and Toyota 4Runner and this was by far, hands down, the most fun to drive. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Rides tall, rubber floor mats and water resistant seat (great for hauling scuba gear). Rear sensors are nice considering there are some decent sized blind spots. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have alway been a car fanatic, emphasis on car. Recently I've had to curb my lectures to my wife on the negatives of SUV ownership as this new addition to our garage has pasted permagrins on both of our faces. While my '02 M3 still holds the keys to my heart I grudgingly have to admit the FJ is a more appropriate vehicle for the terrible roads and "one block to the next stop sign" driving of southern california. And on a friends recommendation I recently took the car to an offroad park only an hour away. This 2wd version blew me away at it's off road ability. What torque, what drivability, what offroad prowess. I can't wait for my next baja surf trip.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The things I like best is that it does not have a lot of features that are difficult to use or make decisions for you. If you want to lock your doors, do it, radio knobs, manual seats - everything easy to use. It is a modern antique - it is fun to drive. I find visibility not a problem. Dealer filled with regular fuel, no pings using regular & mileage is 20 in mixed driving. Still use regular fuel. Radio is great, subwoofer is fun. Not a luxury car, a fun car. I am 60, this is a car that is fun for almost anyone. Great quality.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride & seats are perfect. Radio is clear at any level. Great 4 wheel drive, smooth auto transmission. It's lack of high tech devices make it refreshing to own & stress free to operate.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've put 20,000 miles on my FJ in the last 5 months and have nothing but good things to say, no mechanical problems and it performs better than I could have imagined. I have taken it offroad on some of the most difficult 4WD roads in Colorado and it has performed as well as or better than my 97 Jeep Wrangler. I have been on multiple 10+ hour drives and it remained comfortable to sit in (although on a 5 hour trip 2 passengers in the back seat complained about the rear seats being uncomfortable). Biggest complaint is that for a professed offroad vehicle the front bumper can not accept a winch and I am replacing it with an after market steel bumper that will. Very happy!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>4WD capabilities; quietness (used to drive a Wrangler); size of the interior both cabin size and storage area; styling both inside and out; quality of the build, no squeaks or rattles even after lots of offroad use; it has a built in iPod connection; radio controls on steering wheel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased my FJ in January not really knowing what I was getting into. I had read all the reviews and looked at all the videos. My friends were trying to discourage me but I went ahead and got it anyway. I have to say with all my years in vehicle ownership this by far is the most well built, most reliable, and the best priced out of the box car I have ever owned. It drives like a car, it's a beast off roading, and is priced so anyone can afford it. Gas mileage could be better but the power and torque it produces outweighs it. Interior is surprisingly spacious with lots of leg room front and back. It feels like a solidly built SUV. Test drive!</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>73 Land Cruzzer</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I bought a new 73 Land Cruiser in Burlington, Vermont and explored all the country around Plattsburg N.Y. and the Adriondacks. Then out to the Mojave Desert. Then back to the sand hills and mud of my home state Nebraska. I owned the LC for eleven years. In April of 2006, I purchased a fully loaded Black Cherry FJ Cruiser. I feel like I'm 20 again and once again love to be a proud owner of a Toyota. The ride and handling are excellent and with 1000 pounds of four friends, the acceleration was still satisfactory. I took it out to Lake McConahy near Ogalala, NE. and with 100 miles of white sand beaches and the water level way down, we had a blast using the high 4x4. FJ Cruiser good times roll.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Clearence and view. Good mirror coverage in reverse, daylight running lamps. Power, nice sounding acceleration. Good braking and warning others with the well placed light system. Versatility with the folding seats 40/60, 3 pt seat belts and front and side airbags give security for rear passengers.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great handling in traffic and parking. Nice acceleration. Handles smaller than it looks. The wife loves driving it also, since I installed side rails. The blind spots are what they are, you adjust to it. I drove a pickup and I am used to using the side mirrors. I seem to have more a problem gauging traffic with the passenger side mirror than with any other vehicle that I have driven in the past.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased my Silver FJ Cruiser on 02/04/07. I did a lot of research on Edmunds as well as other sites before buying. The truck is def. a head turner, big, powerful, different. The interior has a lot of room, big knobs, stereo isn't too bad, a lot of compartments. Sideview mirrors are a little tough to get used to, but not too bad. As for the outside, I love it. Older drivers might have a tough time getting in w/o running boards, but its def a younger person's car. Gas mileage is ok, but it's a truck so you cant expect much. Overall, I think it's a great buy... powerful, fast, durable, and an attention getter. I would recommend it to anyone in the 25-35 year range.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very roomy and comfortable. The body just looks really cool, very stylish. 3 wipers are great. Roof rack makes it look like a monster.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is by far the best value vehicle on the market today! It is so fun to drive, extremely rugged, very well-built, and has looks without comparison! There is no other vehicle on the market today that has more going for it, especially at such a low price! Please, just do yourself a favor - no matter what other vehicle you are interested in, give the FJ a try with a test drive and you will wonder why you ever even considered any other vehicle! It truly is that good! </TEXT>

<TEXT>First I want to thank everyone who wrote a review, it was very helpful in deciding to purchase my FJ Cruiser. This is one awesome SUV; comfortable, great power, great looks, and incredible off-road capabilites. The blind spots are there but if you know how to drive with your mirrors then its not an issue. Advise for those that do not know how to use side mirrors. Place your head on the driver side window and turn the mirror until you do not see the end of the rear. On the passanger side lean over and turn the mirror out until you can not see the end of the rear. You now have no blind spots. Try it, it works. I can not say enough about this SUV. Toyota out did themselves. Awesome!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have about 1500 miles and this engine is more powerful than I realized. I never have to break 2000 rpms generally in town, it hums at 1200 rpms to 1400 rpms and that is accelerating from stop to the local speed. Gas mileage is very poor but that must be from the high compression engine. This car seems like it could use another gear which could improve mileage. Getting about 19 mpg. Can't imagine what it would be if I had a heavy foot. Women told me I looked handsome driving this car. Made my day.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 4 months and 7,000 miles I am extremely happy with this vehicle. It has excellent power and is very quick off the line. Entering the freeway from the on ramp is a blast, this vehicle flat out moves for an SUV of this type. Overall mpg (city and highway combined) has been 20.5 with premium gas. I find the steering very nimble, the FJ is fun and handles well in traffic. It is also very capable off road right out of the factory. The excellent approach and departure angles helped me leave my buddies behind. Their lifted Chevy Avalanche just couldn't get in to the places I took mine. This vehicle still turns heads and gets compliments where ever I go. You can't go wrong with the FJ!</TEXT>

I like how the back doors open. It makes it so easy to get the kids out in our garage. It drives great and is very comfortable. My husband loves the power. The gas mileage is better than our Jeep so I don't mind. I get about 19 in it so far. We get lots of looks and people stop and ask to check it out. I love that there is no carpet. It makes it very easy to clean especially with 2 children. I like how far you sit from the front window it makes you feel very safe. The whole package is great I would recommend to anyone.

<TEXT>This is a truck meant to go off road but it really bridges the gap between on and off-road drivers. In Four Wheeler magazine, the FJ had the best mileage, best pickup, best quarter mile, best braking and best engine/transmission combo of the seven SUV's tested(Feb 2007). For off- roaders, it also boasts an excellent stock suspension with over 19" of articulation and an engine tuned for torque with 278 lb/ft. The FJ Cruiser does have its drawbacks, however. The full-time 4wd means that you won't be driving from Denver to Vegas on one tank of gas. The rear visibility is pretty poor but a sonar rear-parking assist is available to compensate. In all I highly recommend the FJ. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Unique styling, good stock suspension and a powerful engine make for a very capable ride on and off road. After market parts are readily available for any upgrades you might want to make.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We off-road it on a gulf coast beach a/o 2x/mo. It's been up to every condition we've encountered. Commute to work daily 70 miles RT. Comfortable, feels safe. Handles everything well. Due to design, limited side and rear visibility on highway. Big mirrors help. Drive with caution in freeway traffic until used to using mirrors.

<TEXT>Purchased the FJ in late October, my first trip was for a total of 4026 miles. I drove at speeds up to 105 mph, the FJ performed flawlessly; I used both high and regular octane fuel. My average was 20 mpg, never used the 4WD. We drove to the Grand Canyon, Sequoia NP and Yosemite, The return trip was down Hwy 1, from Monterey, Big Sur and across Hwy 46. The FJ was fun to drive with out any incidents. Most driving fun was on I40, two black H2 Hummers were coming up in the passing lane, I was behind a truck and moved over behind the first H2, the second H2 moved up behind me. It looked like two black H2s were escorting my Voodoo Blue. They wanted to lose me thus the 105 MPH and could not. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>As a senior (over 65), I like unique automobiles, the FJ fits that category. I purchased new and still own a 67 Olds 442, a 94 TT Supra 26K miles, a 99 E430 Sport Mercedes 51K miles and the FJ, I love them all. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My standards are very high as my other vehicles are all German (Porsche & Audi) but this truck is great! On and off road manners are really great. It handles and performs very well for an SUV. Off road it is superior to most stock off road vehicles that i've seen at the Jeep Jamborees and the like. The engine, suspension, and chassis are really great. This is a fun SUV to drive and I would never say that about SUVs in the past as they are all too sluggish. The FJ proves me wrong with its strong performance, excellent ride, and great off road capability and toughness. My hat goes off to them for really getting the value built into this truck.

<TEXT>This is the first SUV I've owned in 10 yrs. Traded in my BMW 330i for it. Though I'll miss the quickness and nimbleness of the 330i, I absolutely love my FJ! Before the 330i (and Volvo 850), I owned a Jeep Grand Cherokee and two Ford Explorers. These vehicles don't hold a candle to the FJ. Engine power is just right for its size, comfort is great and utility if excellent. The only drawback I can see so far is what others are saying. The rearward visibility is really bad. Use your mirrors well and don't forget to physically turn your head before changing lanes on the highway. Have yet to see if gas mileage lives up to its 24 highway / 19 city billing.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Got my FJ about a month before a very early snow/ice storm up here which lasted several days. I was able to make it in to work every night without a problem. The first night I was driving through snow up to the front bumper. I don't mean just to get out of the driveway or a few feet but 15 miles! I can't wait for spring so I can pick up some mudders and head to the woods. This truck is everything that Toyota wanted it to be and simply that; a no frills, no heated seats or carpet (give me a break, buy a car girly man), not as smooth as your wife's SUV, ?Old School Truck?. Go get it muddy, hose it out and then do it again. "But it might get scratched"..."Yea, what?s your point?" </TEXT>

Everywhere I go people ask "what kind of truck is that" "how much was it" etc etc. I'm not afraid to say that I've had at least 1 positive comment a day since my purchase. Mine is yellow. I'm very impressed with the on-road comfort. Every 4x4 I've ever had was rough on road, but not the FJ. The inside is super easy to clean. My little 4 year old boy loves it too, and the back is perfect for him, even on long trips. I have to say I wouldn't change anything about it, except maybe a little better gas mileage.

I cruise out to the mountains nearly every weekend to work on my cabin restoration and to 4wd a bit. This puppy is TOUGH. I have run it up fairly steep talus and soft powdery roads and it doesn't lose grip or fade me off the trail at all. I've run it through deep-ish water where it crosses trails and again it rolls tough. I've also loaded it down with construction materials. Easy to load and manage for the most part.

<TEXT>The FJ Cruiser is the best built and most reliable vehicle on the market today. The designing, testing, and engineering that went into the FJC is unsurpassed by none. It has taken vehicle design to a new level by reaching out to the customer and finding out what they want in an offroad vehicle. In doing so, Toyota has developed a vehicle that can, right off the factory floor, conquer virtually any obstacle put in front of it on the trails and then drive home in on the highway at over 80 mph in comfort. I have no doubt that it will be with me for better than 300,000 miles. With the development of the FJ Cruiser, I think Toyota has some other companies scared in their tracks. </TEXT>

We strapped five bicycles to the outside and drove from Florida to North Carolina for a bike race. Comfortable and handled like a charm. Drove 80 on the highway and got 19-20 mph, even with the bikes! Once there, we went off road and did all sorts of climbing on back roads with no trouble at all. Actually, the ride is so smooth on the road I got stopped by the police doing 60 in a 45 without realizing it. (Luckily got off with a warning)</TEXT>

<TEXT>My black FJ has been a real head turner. I am constantly being stopped and asked about how I like it and it's fun to watch people crane their necks to get a better look as I drive by. Surprisingly smooth ride for an off- road vehicle. It has the tight, sturdy build that you expect from a Toyota. Lots of power, it passes with ease. Front seats feel very roomy, though the back seats are a bit short on leg room. There are only two small rear passenger windows which do not open, giving it a tank-like feel back there. But who cares, I'm driving. All told, a fabulous package of quality, style and versatility at a great price. Toyota's hit a home run with this one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased the Auto trans. "C" package Canadian version (6-disc, side airbags, roof-rack, 120v outlet, dashtop gage cluster, diff lock etc) about 5 weeks ago. This vehical is a blast to drive off-road, climbs like crazy, lots of ground clearence (except for running boards) and is very roomy and confortable on long trips. The towing power is excellent. I removed the running boards last week, as they are badly bent from off-roading, if you intend on doing any off-roading get rid of these useless things and get factory or aftermarket rock-rails. Other then srcatched paint from branches this truck is SOLID! This is a to-hell-and- back SUV. The FJ is no poser, take it off-road where it belongs.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ability to go where no sane person would go, toughness and power. Great sound system w/mp3 jack. 120V power is handy as well. Inclinometer is very handy on knarly terrain.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>When I found out that I would have to be driving in areas that had a lot of snow I started looking for something in 4x4. I needed something that had a dry storage place since I am a traveling music teacher. The FJ fit the bill perfectly. I can carry all of my materials and it is really fun to drive. I also have a 2005 Tacoma and the FJ drives similar to the Tacoma. The biggest difference is the Tacoma is a little more on the nimble side. But this is a heavy SUV that does not drive like a heavy SUV. I am using regular unleaded and I get between 18 and 20 MPG. That is the same as the Tacoma. And it is cute too. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love my stripped down 4wd fj cruiser it is awesome offroad and on. The only extras are air conditioning, convienience pkg, differential lock and roof rack. It looks cool with the black steel wheels and it holds lots of gear inside and on the the roof. The plastic interior parts are my only complaint.. they scratch much too easily.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I especially like the clearance for offroad use, that there is no carpet, the well designed roof rack and the handy little storage box above the steering wheel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We purchased a 2007 FJ Cruiser for our family, it is our fourth and, unfortunatley, final Toyota (we have two and Cruisers and a Highlander). After only 8000 miles the transmission failed on the FJ Cruiser and Toyota todate has refused to honor the warranty. The reason for the failure is moisture got into the transmission case. Toyota's reason for not honoring the warranty is because the vehicle was used off road. Keep in mind this is an off road vehicle; in fact Toyota advertises the FJ on their website as purely an off road vehicle - there are no pictures of the vehicle used on a road. We used the FJ in ways that are less demanding and safer than how the vehicle is marketed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my very first SUV. I think I could not have made a better choice. This SUV is a perfect balance between a off & on road SUV. I still belong to the old school of thought,I will take my FJ on the highway once I have completed 1,600 KM. on the inner roads @ 60 to 70 KM Per hour. Therefore I cannot say how it will peform on the highway. However the ride is unbelievable, Iam quite sure it will perform exceptionally well on the highway too. Iam dying to take it off road...Soon as Iam off 1,600km....All systems go...I find the automatic transmission exceptionally smooth..Plus there is lot of pep in the acceleration too.. Long & short you just cannot go wrong with this SUV...PERIOD...</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The front driver & passenger seats are very comfortable.The style,colour and shape of the body is very appealing. Audio system is great too.I feel at a much elevated level when other SUV's come & stand next to me.Height & ground clearance is superb.Most of all it is a parttime 4X4. which saves fuel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Love the retro looks. Headlights should be bigger. Rear door should be designed like the 4runners. Interior can look like a retro but please make it look luxurious like the 4runner or atleast the design is up-to-date. Can't complain about the gas consumptions. It's better than average SUV gas consumptions but more efficent engine would be better. Don't like the Diesel as it pollutes the environment. Other than those mentioned above, love everything about the FJ cruiser. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had mine 6 months now, pleased with everything about it. Off road and on. It will go where ever a Jeep, Rover or Hummer can go and since it is a Toyota it should out last them. MPG is as rated, sure glad there are more around now as I was geting asked questions all the time about it. It was fun to answer them though. Even the model FJ I got from Toyota was top quality like the FJ. It has been a comfortable vehicle for highway travel and amazing off road. I'm hooked for sure. Thank you Toyota!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>It had been a long time since I purchased a new car. I was scared. Firstly, prices, car and gas, all the makes and models. Yuck! But alas, I walked in to Toyota, my first car was a 1982 Cressida, cautiously. To my surprise, I did not have to look any further. There she was! My next new car, well actually SUV, a 2007 FJ Cruiser. It was mine if she rode half as cool as she looked, and she did. I felt so safe. I felt so powerful. I felt so cool. Her engine growled, she sat up high, was easily manuverable, and built like a tank. Her gas mileage wasn't awful, her price was almost palpable, $35,000 after all the bells and whistles. So, caution to the wind, I really loved this SUV, so I bought it!</TEXT>

People are always asking if they can look at it and "What is it??" I no longer have to search the parking lot - since there are so few here where I live, it really stands out. I put over 2000 miles on it the first month I had since everyone wanted a test ride. It has such a smooth ride when I took my oldest daughter for a test ride she asked me why we were going so slow? We were doing 65, she thought we were doing about 40! Roomy, comfortable, good gas mileage. I LOVE IT!!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a truely amazing vehicle. Being an avid Land Cruiser fan and not being able to afford one, when I saw it, I was instantly sold. I have read a lot about this SUV for the last 6-7 months and now I can say I don't believe most of the complaints that I read. I simply like everything about it. The rear door is an added safety feature cause I have a 5 year old and now she cannot open the door on her own and run away. She has to stay back there and wait until daddy gets out to assist her during dropping her and picking her back from school. If you are a good driver and actually 'watch' over your shoulders for blind spots, there is no problem with visibility. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Unbelievably fun to drive. It's roomy and quiet. I especially like the backup warning system. The stereo is unreal, hard to tell where the music is coming from. The back door is huge and opens in the "correct" direction. The air conditioner? You could hang meat in here. Oil filter is very easy to change with a drain built into the engine compartment to make changing oil a clean job. My friends comment on how solid it sounds when a door is shut. Warning: Do not press the brake pedal with any force if you don't want to stop, right now. The build quality is awesome. I can see two of these in our driveway. Absolutely no regrets about buying this vehicle. Thank you Toyota. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I went on a trip to AZ and asked for a SUV rental. We got an FJ. For one week, I fell in love. One year passed, and last week, I went and bought one. Total happiness. Went from a BMWZ4 to this. No complaints. None. Not a van, nor a 4 door same ole same ole SUV. I like the cup holders and hidden compartment in dash for my stuff! This SUV drives unlike any other I have had, and that includes, Pathfinder, Navigator, Expeditions. Better because it strikes a hit in the unique ride and rides exceptionally well. No truck feeling here. Performs great, rugged but functional. And just take your time backing, just like the BMW, go slow and look. No worries!! I will have this for a long, long time!</TEXT>

In wind over 25 MPH it is all over the road like a hound dog's breakfast, too many blind spots due to oversized pillars, paint is chipping off faster than you can touch it up. At 3000 mile rear diff replaced. Weather stripping on windows deformed roof leaking form roof rack mounts and the list goes on and on.

<TEXT>FJ Rox! Having owned a couple of international scouts, an fj40, various jeeps and a 4runner, I believe the FJ comes as close to perfect as we can get without a custom design. I purchased my 2007 FJ in Dec of 2006. I have taken the family across country and off road. This vehicle is comfortable and affordable. One minor complaint is the clam shell doors. I have spent many awkward moments attempting to get the kids from the back seat. First opening the front stepping out opening the back closing the front then letting the kids out squeezing by and the opening the front, closing the back then closing the front. Tight parking is tuff with these doors. Worth it? Oh yes. Thumbs up!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My FJ has been a great vehicle to own. I have added some extras to make it even nicer and more fun to drive. Have BBS rims, nerf bars, Clarion DVD nav stereo, bull bar with skid plate and the ever popular back up camera. It accelerates nicely for a vehicle this style. Very easy to accelerate to 100 quickly. Runs great in the snow. The cons would have to be gas mileage, unstable in windy conditions (gusty over 30 mph winds). I feel it is very roomy inside as I am 6'5 230. My kids are 10 and 7 and have no problems getting in or out the back doors. Maybe a bit more room in the back would be nice. Have used only synthetic oil since purchase and have added a K&N filter. A solid 9 out of 10.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Been driving mine for last 2 yrs and it is fun, but on the practical side pretty bad blind spots (everyone agrees on that), exterior paint chips easily, front windshield already cracked ($309 replacement... not sure where the person lives who paid $1200). The clamshell doors are terrible for getting in and out of. The front seat back won't even fold forward enough to help with rear entry. Noisy ride. When visor down, can't see a thing. Sorry to bring everyone down, but this a long list to consider when deciding to buy. Still the most original SUV around. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this truck ! Has great looks, turns heads everywhere I go. Does well on dirt roads and soaks up the bumps well for a truck its size. Awesome traction on wet roads with stock Bridgestone tires. Never once did I get nervous about getting into an accident. Clutch pedal is firm yet easy to depress, shifter is smooth as silk! I average 16 mpg in stop and go driving and get 21 mpg on long highway trips. Doesn't accelerate like a Mustang GT BUT it's predictable and good enough for highway merging during rush hour. If you like a cool looking truck that gets compliments everywhere you go and won't go out of style tomorrow, get the FJ Cruiser. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Great vehicle. Would buy it all over again. A few things you should know before you buy this vehicle. Getting in the vehicle is tight on the knees for the diver, but once you are in there is plenty of room. No locking gas cap. Many of these vehicles lean to the left, supposedly because to many heavy items are on the left side of the vehicle. Thin paint, expect a lot of touching up painting. Of course there is the visibility problem when changing lanes or backing up. I just installed a spot mirror on my right side mirror and its 90% better. I also purchased a backup camera for the vehicle. I don?t think I really needed to but I thought it would be fun to use!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love Jeeps and Toyotas. The FJ Cruiser is the best of both. Sized like a Wrangler, but with class of a 4runner. I am in my 60s, and this is just plain fun to drive. Good 4 wheel capability, very comfortable in town and on the interstate. Been told I can use mid-grade, not premium, that should help. I love off-roading, camping and blackpowder, and I never plan to "grow up". This vehicle should help that!! The only negatives: wish the gas cover locked, console box should have a cover, and wish I could have gotten the package without the sub-woofer. Storage box would have been more useful to me.

Everyone loves the color and the different style. I used to own a 77 FJ 40 Land Cruiser which I dearly loved, so I really like the retro features. The ride is excellent. I will never take it off road, but I live 2 1/2 miles off the main road and we get a lot of snow, so I am anxious to use the 4X4. My dream car used to be a 4Runner, but this was love at first sight. Lots of power. My mechanic says real heavy duty frame and great engine accessibility. Love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have had the FJ now almost a month now. While the gas mileage isn't what my 05 Accord was, it isn't too bad for an SUV (at least that is what I am told). So far with under 1K miles on the engine, I am averaging about 19 mpg. The most obvious downer about thie FJ is that the engine requires the use of 91+ octane fuel. The ride is great, smoother than my Accord's, and there is much less road/wind noise in the FJ as well. When you are in it, kinda feels like you are in a tank with all the short verticle glass around you.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The FJ's ride is quiet with lots of room. The 0-40 is strong for a v6 SUV - lots of passing power. The rugged good looks will appeal to all sorts of people. Kids love it. MPG is around 20 with the automatic.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Front window, large; handles, knobs and seats. Nice fit and finish, Easy wash interior. Better MPG with the auto and even better with the 4X2 and this car will go where other 4x2's can't.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With less than 1000 miles I had this vehicle off the road on the beach and in the dunes. Ride and handling were excellent. Cornering on hard surfaced roadway was flat with good feel. The suspension can seem a bit stiff but, the vehicle is intended for off-road use. The fit and finish is excellent and the use of non-metallic paints is a nice touch - easy care. My overall experience has been well worth the investment. I compared the FJ to several vehicles. In the end, the famous toyota quality won me over. No regrets. It's excellent build quality, fit and finish, and available accessories are more than enought for any individual desire.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Water resistant seats, 27 inch water fording, classic steel wheels, washout interior, large knobs and buttons, fit and finish, ride on hard surfaced roads, air conditioning, roof rack, rock rails. My most favorite feature is that everyone has to ask about it. Without doubt toyota has a winner here</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After 5 suburbans, this is fun. Goes where I want to go but couldn't go before. Fuel mileage is not good. Have yet to top 15.5 even on a 600 mile hwy run. I am in the dirt every day and love the rubber floors. Easy clean. Very agile, eye catching and peppy. Wife drives a V8 Touareg which is great on the road but the FJ is a fun vehicle. Other than mileage, I believe. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Having driven an H2 for four years previous to this vehicle, it took some getting used to size and "bells & whistles" wise. But off road capabilities are good. Driving pretty darned smooth. Room inside surprising, even in back. Love the look, little worried about all the plastic, but will just wait and see how wear and tear affects it. Definitely not missing the H2's 10 mpg gas guzzling in the city. FJ is fun to drive & very satisfying. Not luxurious, but definitely comfortable. Price was also a real deal in my mind. Never had a Toyota before, so this is a new experience. We'll see how it goes with time.</TEXT>

I like the styling and the performance of it. I sized down from a Tahoe and I don't regret it one bit. This truck is more of a truck then my Tahoe ever was. Go take one for a test drive, the only bad thing you find is that you neeed to figure out how you want to pay for it. One drive and you'll be hooked.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This thing feels like a big truck. It feels very solid and well built. There are more traction options than you can shake a stick at on our 6 spd stick 4x4. The seats are waterproof, which is nice because of the floor mat, you can actually hose the truck out. The add on gauge pods in the center are cool too. It's a real pleasure to drive like I said, and plenty of leg room and cargo room if you need it. It has 3 wipers for the front windshield, and a rear wiper, plus household current outlets in the front and back. Also a real parking assist system that beeps when you get close to something. A great CDROM came with it too, way better than reading the owners manual, tons of videos.</TEXT>

<TEXT>As a loyal Toyota owner for 30 years I have come to expect great things from them. Over the last thirty years, I have owned Camrys, trucks, a 1984 Land Cruiser and now the FJ Cruiser. I first fell in love with the styling, but once behind the wheel, I knew I had found THE car for me. My old Land Cruiser lasted ten years and 270,000 miles. I sold in in 1994. Unfortunately I couldn't afford another as the prices went through the roof. What a surprise and pleasure to get back into a "Cruiser" without emptying my life savings. This FJ is fun to drive, gets 19-20 mpg on the highway and turns heads where ever I go. I intend to keep it for at least ten years if not longer.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 6 speed manual is silky smooth. The ride is firm, but very comfortable. The 24 valve 4.0 liter VVTI engine seems to be perfectly suited to this vehicle. Acceleration is very good and braking is excellent.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I LOVE my new Sun Fusion yellow FJ Cruiser, better known as my FJAMMER, even as a 40 year old mother! It is comfortable, handles well and is a ton of fun to drive around town. The visibilty took some getting used to with the rear mounted tire and vertical outside mirrors, lack of viewing out the side windows, but nothing that I couldn't adjust to. The rear gear sonar is a big help when backing up. And how could I ever have another car without roof mounted speakers to spoil me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been looking at the re-built FJs for sometime and thinking about getting one - but no modern safety equipment was a drawback. So when the new FJ came out I was nearly 1st in line and got mine. Burgundy Red 4WD. Very functional yet a fully capable off-roader. The sensing device that beeps when backing up too close seemed silly and I was not going to buy it. However I had to take what was available and mine does have this. It is the best thing for backing up - otherwise very limited rear view. With the spare tire on the back it would be very hard to judge the distances without it. Love it so far. Get one now.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The compass and inclinometer are tied with the backing sensor as gimmincks. But the thing I really like is the obsession with functionality. Everything works well and shows that the designers were thinking about how to eliminate the fussy stuff and put in what was really useful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bought the FJ two days ago and had to drive 170 miles back home. I had fun driving all the way back. After getting used to the blind spots and limited visibility through the rear window, I actually settled down and was cruising up to 75 on the road. It is mostly quiet, civilized and runs alongside many higher priced SUVs. My kids love the back seats and the suicide doors to get into the back. Overall fun factor would have to be a 9.5!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I now have 2K miles on the FJ and one of my beefs is the very poor gas mileage. It is no where close to 21 mpg on the highway. I'm getting closer to 16 mpg on the highway and much less in town. The other beef is these are made in Japan - I took off a part of the bumper in an accident and the dealership said it will take 2-3 months to get the part shipped here from Japan - have to put it on a boat! My rear tire cover was ripped off by a bunch of kids - be sure and lock yours down. Other than that, I am enjoying the vehicle.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Our FJ is black, and with the white roof we nicknamed it the Skunk... we just added tint to the windows all the way around and love the change it made in the look and feeling inside. I originally considered a Honda Element, Nissan Frontier, and Xterra, but after driving them and then finally seeing and then driving the FJ there was not longer any doubt which one we wanted. We had to drive 600 miles round trip to get one, but it was worth it. I'm a photographer and need versatility.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been very disappointed with the FJ! Current Land Rover owner... don't think for a second that you're getting one of those for $30K. First impression driving, very WEAK on power. The wife's Accord has way more get up and go. Rear visibility is tolerable for GREAT drivers, for average ones look out. Cannot believe those tiny windows in the back don't even open, the back seat is like a crypt. Can't see anything outside, so much for an "off-road" vehicle. Storage space is also very limited. If ALL you will use this for is off- roading, fine, but it's no commuter.</TEXT>

The FJ is fun, turns heads, holds quite a bit of stuff and then some. I already have 6,000 miles on it and it's great. I have been getting about .5-1.0 MPG better than the window sticker. I have the 6sp and the shiftng is not as smooth as I thought. I can also feel too many vibrations through the steering wheel. This takes away from the 'tank' like feel. I live in Seattle and this thing is horrible for visibility. The triple wipers do nothing to move the water off the windshield in time, even at the highest setting.</TEXT>

It has an extremely solid feel and with the full time four wheel drive that comes with the manual transmission it really hugs the road. I've only done some mild off roading but it handled some fairly large obstacles and ruts at a speed that would have bounced my brain loose in my Wrangler.

Not as roomy or comfortable on the road as the Z71, but just as smooth,less noise inside, and better mpg. I never took the Z71 off-road and rearly more than one person rides with me. The Rubicon was better off-road in the tight spots and the visibility was much better. The FJ is better on hill climbs and declines.

It has all the outward appearance of a basic SUV but is suprisingly comfortable and easy to drive. Other highlights are large interior controls, wonderful upgraded stereo system, great seats and just quality build throughout the entire vehicle. This is the kind of automobile that makes you smile every day when you drive plus you know that if you look after it you will have it for 200000 miles plus. This is pragmatism and whimsy in a package that no one comes close to competing with, all at an unbelievable price. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was tired of all automatic, highly refined car-like SUVs that you could not dare get dirty. FJ is just what the doctor ordered: it is rugged, rubberized on the interior and built for utility all the way around. It is outstanding off-road. I take it on trails when I go on photo expeditions and camping with my kids. It is well- mannered on the roads and proves to be a fun commuter as well. In short, this truck does an exceptionally good job on and off the road. Of course it has lots of plastic and rubber; it is built for utility. Blind spots everyone keeps talking about have not been a problem; paring sonar and side mirrors do a good job of fixing all that. I love my FJ!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the best car I have ever owned! This is a fun car to drive, very responsive to the wheel and pedals. It offers a nice smooth and quiet ride in the city, yet it is fully capable of going off tackling some of the roughest 4x4 trails. The FJ has received a lot of comments about the large c-pillars blocking vision. I have not found this to be a problem. The side large mirrors more than make of lost vision. You just have to recondition they way you drive.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have waited for over 30 years for this vehicle. I always wanted an FJ40 Land Cruiser, but could never get one. Now, I have the vehicle that is fun and still makes sense... no more poor fuel mileage from those Chevy Tahoes I used to drive. Yet, I can still pull the little boat and go hunting/fishing. PS... I have to allow at least 30 extra minutes when I go anywhere, just to talk with the people who want to see the car and find out all about it. I love this cruiser.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Three words... too much fun! Fit and finish are great, as always with a Toyota. Doors open wide and provide good access to the rear seat area. The base option stereo is just fine and with the Ipod jack, music selection is unlimited. The water resistant seat fabric is perfect for morning surfs and with the 4WD... Baja is just around the corner. Best fun I've had with a vehicle in a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I first saw the FJ Cruiser on the computer last year, I loved the look of it and when it came out in April of 2006 I found a dealer and took it for a test drive. That's all it took, I'm hooked. I have the Voodoo Blue loaded with all the extra. I love the drive it gives you, not truck like but smoother and turning, you feel nice and safe. Hey it's a Toyota how can you go wrong... you can't. I just know this is going to be a long lasting vehicle. I'm driving in style. I love my FJ Cruiser. Vickie </TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck has got some interesting comments in the week I've had it. One guy asked, `What's the room like in the back seat?' My response, `Not much, but my buddies will put up with it.' The key here is that I have no kids to stick back there like it seems some who rip this truck. My friends and wife said it's not bad back there, but they aren't 40 year olds with trick knees. ... This truck feels solid. It's not punchless like the Wrangler. It also doesn't have the comforts of a LR3, but this is a SUV in the mid-$20k's. What do you expect? ... The blind spots haven't been a big deal. (I'm young enough to be able to turn my head.) For a guy coming from a domestic pickup, I've been impressed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the FJ as a replacement for my 2000 Celica GTS that was totaled by a drunk driver. My priorities focused on safety/survivability but something as fun as my Celica; the FJ was a perfect fit. More room all around, my 4 and 7 year old kids love the rear- theater seating and now I can just hose off all the junk they usually leave in my car. If you're looking for luxury refinements, get a 4Runner or higher. Living in the OC, one dealership asked me if I wanted to install custom leather seats? Huh? The beauty of the FJ is its utilitarian personality and natural "good looks". The FJ may not "dress up" like soccer- mom SUVs, but it's better lookin' and kicks!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The FJ is surprisingly quick and agile in turns. More than enough power when 4X4-ing. Retro-styling always turns heads. Gas mileage on freeway better than I thought. Don't compromise, Sun Fusion is the color you want!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle handles great even on a very windy day. The three windshield wipers can be a little distracting at first. Taller passengers who sit in the back do not have as much support for their shoulders as the seats are a little short:however,using the headrest really helps. This vehicle is very fun to drive and its ride is very smooth. It is extremely easy to clean as you just wipe it out.The lights on the side view mirrors give me more visibility when I am driving down the street. The rear tire sometimes blocks visibility. My only disappointment was the gas mileage. While it is a 6 cyl, it uses more gas than my previous Toyota 6 cyl. Altogether I am having a lot of fun owning it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My kids LOVE the stereo system. I can't get them out of mom's cool car! It is SO easy to drive. I love the way it handles. There is plenty of room in the back to carry things. Seats fold down easily. This car comes with curtain and side airbags. A very safe and fun car to drive.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well we went it to pick up our minivan for service, and came away with an Fj. My wife could not be happier. She was a van hater. This thing is very fun to drive. We have the Blue 6 speed manual and it really is a powerful rig. Ride is surprisingly good on the highway. Have not gone off road yet, but would be surprised if it did not perform great. Positives: the looks (everyone will stop you and ask questions), power is great, room inside is good. Negatives: Gas mileage is not the best (big surprise), premium gas, clamshell doors in back make getting in and out a bit of a chore for the back seat passengers, blind spots are huge, but mirrors are very good, so this is less of an issue.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After having an Element and liking the functionality but wanting something that could tow more and have a V6, Toyota came out with my ideal vehicle. I love just about everything about it. It looks like nothing else on the road, rides great, has ample power, and is one of the few vehicles I can stretch out my legs in and still drive comfortably. With the V6 it has more than enough highway power, and an tow as much as I need. The HVAC controls are HUGE, perfect if you are wearing gloves. I am really impressed by the build quality and overall tight feeling of it. Also the glove box on top of the dash is something I have not seen before, but is nice.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The styling is great. I have never been stared at so much in my life. FJammer stereo with subwoofer rocks.

So, following the Toyota hype, I went with the FJ, and regret it completely.

<TEXT>I've had the car 6 months and I still can't get comfortable driving. The seat has no lumbar support. Changing lanes is always an adventure. The blind spots to the side and rear are enormous. I put some blind spot mirrors on and they help a bit, but even after driving for 30 years I still find it a challenge to change lanes. The mileage is mediocre, and considering it requires premium fuel, it's no cheaper to run than a much larger and more comfortable Tahoe which uses regular, even though the Tahoe mileage is less. I had a leased Tahoe which is turned in to purchase, rather than lease, the FJ. It was a BAD decision. The Tahoe is the best vehicle I ever had and I hope to purchase another ASAP</TEXT>

I burn only regular gas, no problem & get from 19.8 city to 23 mpg hwy. average around 20mpg. I have not found the blind spots to be a problem, even in Dallas multi lane heavy traffic.

<TEXT>I bought my FJ because it was different than all the other SUVs out there. First the bad: can't open front & rear door if you are parked too close to another car to get access to rear. When using a fast gas pump, won't handle the volume and keeps shutting off pump, must pump slowly. Front passenger mirror too small and no light. Dumb design to have to take headrests off rear seats to fold them down. Rear "portholes" too small for rear passengers. No console with cover. Premium gas required. Now the good: It attracts attention for unusual design. White roof keeps interior much cooler (I live in Florida). Great sound system. Comfortable front seats. Easy to read and operate controls.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Took my FJ on a heavy 4X4 trip; big game hunting in the Rockies. The FJ was severely scratched due to branches on forest roads. The optional front skid plate has major dents and the factory black painted skid plate just behind it was destroyed. No ordinary 4X4 trip, a foot of sticky black mud covered by 15" of snow. Even those little ATVs were having problems. All other 4X4s had to chain up all fours. My FJ made it through w/optional BFG tire package. It was weird hearing the ATC use the ABS to grab more traction. Had to use the rear locker twice. Clean up not easy as interior/exterior has lots of little spaces to trap mud. Glad I bought it w/ATC,BFGs, and air locker. </TEXT>

<TEXT>As with any vehicle purchase, I did a ton of homework on potential purchase options. To be honest, I was mostly scared off the FJ before test driving due to all the comments about poor visibility, impractical 3rd doors and limited 2nd row seating, soft glass, etc. I'm beginning to wonder if these people actually have driven the FJ. For starters, if you adjust the mirrors properly (and as spelled out in the manual), there is no blind spot issue. I have a 3 year old, and the car seat fits fine with plenty of room to get him in and out. The cabin is absolutely spacious. Get the manual tranny if you can find one. You'll pay more in gas, but its worth the fun in driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have been looking at different sport utility for many years, since 2004 hurricane season. After seeing and reading about the FJ for one day and test drove it the next day. The decision was made!! Have had the vehicle for 3 months now, love driving it and never have to worry about driving in the areas that are prone to flooding. Love the smooth ride, it doesn't feel like I'm driving a truck. It feels more like I'm driving my sienna, but taller.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Favorite feature to this vehicle is the ease of driving. The back door opens to the left. The configurations of the seat to haul stuff in the back. The glass on the back door also opens. The sub-woofer and cd changer. The compass and elevation gauge.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought the FJ Cruiser for fun. I live in Texas and with all the rain we have had you would think I would keep it lame. My friends and I go hog hunting on a huge corn farm... been out about 5 times. They all park their 4 wheel vehicles and pile into mine because it gets us out there and back! (27 inch water clearance!) If you want an excellent, fun, go anywhere vehicle then I can't say enough. I have never run premium gas in it. The blind spot is easily corrected by moving out the side mirrors. Can't wait to invest in a lift kit etc and really make this thing do some rock climbing!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The FJ is a great remake of the original Landcruisers - the ones we all remember seeing on TV as kids on National Geographic trudging through an African reserve or remote mountain trail. The new remake of the orignal mid-50s' design (internally designated FJ by Toyota) has enough comfort for every day around town use, but didn't lose it's functionality like the current luxury monster using the Landcrusier name. Having worked in the Australian bush country where the older landcruisers rule, I've always held this reliable, simple yet functional design in high regard. The new FJ has plently of storage space, good elbow & shoulder room and ample power. It feels solid and functional.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The FJ looks great. It has a modern look with plenty of retro cues. The long wheelbase to length ratio makes it feel nimble for a SUV. The simplicity and functionality of the interior is refreshing in a modern vehicle - big knobs, easy to reach controls, full gauges, plenty of storage space.</FAVORITE>

Best mileage at 65 MPH is 18, around town 9-12 with a light foot. Had lift kit problems and dealer told me I'd have to take it to an outside shop. Second week I had it, took it to a car wash.

The Little Grand Canyon with a foot of snow was the hardest trail that it was on, and it made it out after some coaxing. Wish I had a locker in the front, a winch, or more aggresive tires. Just got done with a weekend of wheeling in Silverton and it proved to be a stellar machine. Pulled the popup camper there, and never would have known that you were pulling a load. Really a fun vehicle to drive, had enough get up and go for me, yet is so smooth over the highway that you can enjoy the drive to the next off road trail. Gas gets a little pricey with the premium.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Because it is made by Toyota, I can trust and depend on their products. With my FJ, I love it and cherish it because it was built with style and performance in mind. I love to drive it, it is so quiet and smooth to speed on the road. I only get 18 miles in the city but terrific mileage in the long drive of 22 miles per gallon using premium gasoline which I have no doubt adds benefit. I added a bug deflector to save my windshield in the long run and wind side windows deflector to deflect the wind during driving to lessen the wind noise when the windows are open on the open road. I will score this car a perfect 10 as to what it can do for me and what I expect on it. Its simply the best!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Having more fun with this vehicle than any other I've owned -- can't wait for ski season. Owned many cars and trucks, including 2 Outbacks and a Tacoma, and they never made me smile as the FJ does. The documented issues are there (visibility, fixed rear window, mpg, etc.) but you need to look at how they impact you and what you are comparing to. With that info/bias before I went shopping, I still ended up with the FJ. 50 extra HP than my V6 Tacoma (99) and the same mileage. Better visibility than a truck with a shell on back. Rear seat legroom comparable to most of the other in-class vehicles (I'm 6'2" and can sit behind the driver's seat set for my legs). Did I mention fun?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 1996 F250 Powerstroke for the new FJ Cruiser - what a change. Very little road noise, excellent handling, reasonable acceleration, a stereo I can actually hear, and a smooth ride. I had a 90 4Runner, so I expect Toyota quality, and it hasn't disappointed. Surprisingly, my gas mileage has been better than expected - I recently got an average of 23 MPG on a road trip to southern Colorado, and averaged over 18 MPG pulling my Coleman tent trailer over Rabbit Ears pass up to Steamboat Lake. I've only done a little 4-wheeling so far, and the shift into 4 high was a little harder than I'd like, but I think I'll have this one for a long, long time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Above and beyond expectations. Reported issues (visibility, mileage, rear seat, plastic) are there, but have proven insignificant with the overall package received. Blows away every other vehicle in its class (and others I had in consideration) when you get behind the wheel. Mileage is on par with the performance. Visibility is fine after you get to know the vehicle. Rear seat legroom is on par with other vehicles in its class (there is something wrong with the data as reported - I am 6'2" and when I adjust the drivers seat to my driving position, I can sit behind the front seat - tight but my legs fit). Others might get me to the slopes, but the FJ keeps me smiling. No regrets. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this cuz we didn't want to be practical. We wanted something fun. We've always liked the styling of the classic Toyota FJ line. This car is fun and has a look we admire. You've read about all the good stuff from others, but let me describe it from another point of view. I brought 4 kids to the park and it was a challenge to get them in and out with the rear door configuration. There are blind spots and getting used to them still has its risks. Takes premium gas only. MPG stinks and is similar to my V8 Chevy. Difficult to close and open rear doors from inside. This car has keyless entry but no alarm. One DC plug in front. In a nutshell, should have more features for the price. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased the FJ in April after husband fell in love with it. I too really like the vehicle but have found that the "suicide" type doors do not function well with a family. Getting in and out (especially in tight parking spaces) can be a real nuisance with kids. Also found that the sun visors are of little use because of the interior design. One other flaw that we have found is that the windshield is a rock magnet!! The straight up and down offers no deflection of rocks. Let me say again, we really love this vehicle, but are trading it in on a 4Runner simply because of the door issue which we thought would not be as big a problem as it was. If it came in a true 4 door we'd keep it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>After 2+ months of ownership, and nearly 5,000 miles under us, the FJ had performed without so much as a single issue to complain to the dealershp about. I've added the front Brush-Guard, and the optional front skid plate, because you just never know what you will need here in the North Georgia Mountains. I just returned from a 2,000+ mile trip up North, and found that while staying at or near the speed limit of 65-70, I got right at 22 mpg, taking it up to the 10 mph over the speed limit window, my mileage dropped to 19.5. The FJ is in a word, SOLID. Its a head turner for sure, but the comfort and security while driving it makes it a must have for anyone looking in this class.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm a serious desert rat, living in Moab, Utah. I have dogs and I practically live out of my Cruiser. I'm out every day in the backcountry. Of course the Cruiser was made for exactly this kind of life. It's OK living the urban lifestyle, but it's totally underutilized. If you're only going to use it for city-type commuting, you won't like the mileage or lack of visibility (although not bad, really). Be sure to use premium gas, it really does bring the numbers up to where they're tolerable, worth the extra cost. This vehicle is truly an engineering marvel - Toyota's thought of everything. I'm a 56 year old woman and I love it! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Unbelievable off road. Best I've ever been in. Great stereo. The many little thoughtful things Toyota put in the interior, easy to clean. Fun to drive.

<TEXT>I have had the FJ for 6 months. Unlike my usual research, I bought this on a whim. I knew the quality would be there, so no problem. Well the seats are the problem. While the front is roomy enough, there is a distinct difference between the driver and passenger seat. The passenger seat makes my leg numb in about 30 minutes?? The back seat is really tight, not much room at all, my family is TALL. If you're 5?10? or under, no problem. The rest of the FJ is great. Easily the best looking truck in my opinion. It will go anywhere. It?s got plenty of power, is fairly quiet, has an unexpectedly smooth ride. I really like this thing, but the back seat will probably make me get rid of it.</TEXT>

The water resistent interior will come in handy with our 20 month old son who thinks throwing things that tend to leak is an olympic sport that he is determined to master. We went with the silver for a more neutral color to go with the tough looks of the car. Crawl around under this rig and you find serious off-road hardware.

<TEXT>I'm still a newbie to my FJ, but I just love it. There's nothing else like it on the road. People just stare at it all the time. I've yet to meet anyone that didn't tell me how awesome they think it is. My one concern I have right now is gas mileage. I have only had my FJ for a week, but it only got 15 mpg on my first full tank. It is supposed to be around 19-20. At $3.29 per gallon for premium fuel and a 19 gallon tank - it cost me $62 to fill up the tank this morning. At 15 mpg - that's only 285 miles on a tank of gas - or .22 cents per mile. Keep this in mind if you plan on purchasing an FJ. Just to make a quick 2 mile trip to the store and back will cost you over a buck in gas alone.</TEXT>

Must have the reverse alarm..great feature especially with the limited visibility to the rear. I will probably go back to get running boards to help when my parents want to get in. The vehicle sits high for older passengers or drivers. My kids slept comfortably in in the rear and like the rear despite the rear door and rear windows that don't open.

<TEXT> The FJ's larger interior and move powerful engine along with its great 4X4 abilities make it the vehicle of choice for me.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE> Its offroad performance.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was skeptical about buying this vehicle at first. But I'm sure glad I did. This FJ is so fun to drive both on and off road. I've had it since June of 06 and I still have a silly grin on every time I'm driving it. She gets a lot of looks. The rear visibility took about 2 days to get used to. It's not a vehicle for everyone but then I'm glad it isn't.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the looks. Love the ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned my FJ for 6 months. It's ugly in a good way. The blind spot is absolutely a problem. By far the best built vehicle I?ve ever owned, the engine is smooth and flawless. I took the entire dash apart and I was entirely impressed with the fit and quality compared to other vehicles I?ve owned and worked (Jeep, GMC, Ford, SAAB and Volvo); none were as well thought out. The FJ rides like a car, cruises easily at highway speeds, has good torque and HP at low RPMs, and is a mule off-road. This is not a family car; the rear seat does not have easy access. The windshield is set far forward you have to lean forward to see the light change. Quality and finish are far beyond the competition.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine quality and chassis clearance, the traction control is so good I rarely need to engage 4-wheel drive, and the ride quality is deceptively calm over rough road surfaces. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Black 4x4 6sp have about 8000 miles now. Road trip from Denver to LA was very comfortable. Got about 18-19 mpg on highway. City is between 15-17 mpg. Took it offroad couple times, performed very well. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>One of the best designs by Toyota. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned Big Blue (clearly I got a Voodoo Blue version) for 3 weeks here's what I've found: when you walk outside in a blizzard and see B.B. (Big Blue will be referred to as B.B from now on) you will not be afraid to fire her up and go where ever you want to. B.B.'s huge tires, large ground clearance and generally toughish appearance lend an air of 'I can drive in bad-weather' that is - well, nice. She growls just a little when idling. Again, this is cool, impresses kids. Although it looks like a truck (I traded in a 2000 Ford Ranger for her), I say she drives more like a car. Maybe the wide wheel base - could be new shocks, not sure, the ride is smooth. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>B.B. has a powerful engine. When we go storming up hills, there is no engine lag. When we decide to merge onto the highway, no issue. She gets to some number higher than 55 rather quickly. Also, the back has enough room for my golf clubs and garbage bags.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had owned a Toyota Tacoma doublecab for the last 5 1/2 years and was very happy with it. But it was time to consider trading so I considered my options. After seeing and conducting extensive research on the FJ Cruisers, I purchased one. Overall the ride and initial quaility are excellent. The ride as compared to the Tacoma is much more pleasant and the interior resonates functional quality. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>No nonsense, straightforward functionality of interior features and adjustable controls, welcoming fit of driver environment and seating, imposing exterior stance and strong visual connection to years gone by safari images. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my FJ for a little over a week and over 500 miles. All Black TRD handles like a sporty little truck on the backroads and highway but takes speedbumps and curbs without hardly much of a shaking! Sounds great with the TRD exhaust too! I have had two 4-runners prior to this ('89 and '98) and they were so reliable and tough off road, the FJ had the be the only choice. I tell all my friends who don't already have one or plan on getting one that this should be their next car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine power, handling, style. Looks like the little black tank that could! Just fun to drive anytime, rain or shine! Makes my miserable 90 mile round trip to work so much more enjoyable too!</FAVORITE>
