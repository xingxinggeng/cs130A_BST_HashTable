<TEXT>You name the Gadget - this thing has it. If you actually read the manual (500 pages)you will discover why a Mercedes costs more than most cars on the road today. Example- hold down the heater button after the key is out and the system continues to blow hot air for 20 mins. So while you run into the store for a few quick things, the car is still warm when you get back! The list goes on and on and on. This is an amazing vehicle if you're a gadget freak like me. If your not, you could foolishly mistake it as just another SUV</TEXT>

<TEXT>Drives nicely, low maintenance. Changed 4 tires at 23,000 miles looks fancy and with style not to many people have it. Paint always looks shiny looks as new. Good acoustic, you can all talk and be heard inside the car, different from other vans where only the people in the front can talk. Very silent the motor, no noise from the outside, you get the feeling you are inside a private mini jet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This has got to be the best vehicle in it's crossover class. For the growing family that wants the wagon but not the van you can't beat the R- class. Definitely buy with all the options, then you never look back and regret what you didn't get. The ride is very smooth and yet in the corners it handles pretty tight. The panoramic rooftop is for sure a thing of wonder. This is a definate purchase for the folks wanting great gas efficiency along with great looks and quality. Performs like a true diesel but if you put your foot on the gas there are some ponies under the hood to be discovered.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Panoramic roof, 4-matic, built in everything, 6 seats for real adults! Diesel power rules</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great family vehicle with lots of room and fantastic comfort when cruising on the highway. Low rating on "Fun-to- Drive" because frankly this car/van/stationwagon/crossover isn't intended to be fun to drive the way a sedan might. It's a safe, roomy, family vehicle with style. That said, I will confess that the diesel engine makes this vehicle a beast in the mountains. We live in Colorado and it is sometimes mind- boggling to me how easily this car climbs steep grades. I will say that snow handling was very poor with the original tires, but once replaced became respectable. Fuel economy for this size vehicle is also very respectable. Overall 24-25 mpg. (Around town 19; Highway 27).</TEXT>

<TEXT>The interior is superb, roomy, and comfortable. Except for a driveline noise that seems to be appearing, the interior is quiet and the ride is smooth. You can tell that the engine is a little small for this 5000lb beast, but the 7-speed makes do with what it's got to make it manageable. Fuel mileage is around 17.5 city and 22 highway. Not bad for a 7 passenger vehicle! The maintenance cost is high, so beware. An oil change (just oil, nothing else!) is $280. You can do the maintenance yourself, but I am expecting a challenge from MB on lease turn in time.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roomy, quiet, and smooth. Great interior quality and fit and finish. Good mpg for its size and intention. Good stereo.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Most bang for your buck for a Mercedes by far. Had ours for a month and quite pleased other than the lumbar adjustment is a little lacking with it's the manual lever (akin to something on a 80's Honda). The bluetooth module is also $500 bucks from the dealer and really should be included as well as the available seat adjustments on other models. Another gripe is the navigation; really not as intuitive compared to other less prestigious manufacturers. The diesel has good acceleration and is unbelievably quiet but you'll pay a little extra for it up front and at the pump but hey its four wheel drive. I'm one of those that love the looks and interior styling and hope they don't change it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought our R-class in May of 07 and love it! It is excellent in the snow and there is a lot of room in for all of our stuff! We have little boy so with little ones comes carseats, strollers and bags..the R-class accomodates all of these very well. The only thing I wish it would have had is a middle console in the second row, which is now available on the 08 model. Other than that we love the car. A great buy and reasonably priced for a Mercedes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The R350 was a very good choice at the time of purchase because it was the first true cross-over that focused on room & comfort. The interior design is ingeniously ergonomic. The performance is quaite acceptable for a station- wagon type vehicle. Much to my surprise, there were quite a few intermittent reliability issues (i.e.; the rear hatch would drain the battery in wet conditions. MB did not figure this out until the hatch completely failed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car, fun to drive, Really big and somewhat difficult to park. Exceptionally good performance and gas mileage for a 6 cyl. Quality everywhere with no problems in first 6 months although at the 30 day checkup the service department was a poor. I won't be back to the selling dealer. Skip the parktronic and rear camera. They are only good from about 3 feet.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have 4 small children and I needed a car that would seat all of us. I must admit I wasn't thrilled with the looks of the car and considered it only because it would hold everyone in relative comfort and because the 2008s were on the way and the dealerships had boatloads to get rid of in late July. Having come from a Volvo V70R, I had to have the V8 and not the V6. While the R500 is a great choice for someone with 4 kids, it is nowhere near as responsive or fun to drive as the Volvo. To be fair, the V70R is the Sport version and the R500 has never pretended to be remotely sporty - unless you want to lay down 80 large for the AMG version. After all, its a glorified minivan/station wagon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car thinking it would be a huge hit and I would be one of the first to have one. It seems like I am the only to have one. Personally, I think it looks great. I luckily avoided black because it looks like a hearse is that color. I got the 350 because the 500 was that much more money. This car has extreme steering vibration at high speeds. This vibration also comes with a deep noise that does not sound too good. Yacht length rear doors make nearly imposible to avoid denting a car in a parking lot. Head-lamps keep flashing, door handle does not work at times and reverse lights sometimes fail to work. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We've been driving this beauty around for about a month and couldn't be happier. The R350 is a pleasure to look at, a pleasure to sit in and just plain fun. The kids love it, I love it and it's just surpassed my every expectation...which were high. I come from a long line of MB owners and have come to expect quality and performance, I got them both here. It's not just pretty to look at, it does it's fair share of hauling and stopping and starting in style. I compared it to the Volvo XC90 and just couldn't handle the 'Jeep like' feel of the Volvo. This feels like a luxury car that can also handle lots of people. We love it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Comfortable seating and entering/exiting for everyone. Great A/C and sound. Subtle seat belt reminder (I love this!). Good stowing capacity with seats down. Gorgeous looks. Better than expected gas mileage. Awesome moon roof. Glad to not have sliding doors. Love the auto trunk release.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am one of those crazies who trades every year. This vehicle may finally be the one that passes the year mark for me. Perfect ride, perfect power. Still one of the freshest looks out there in the sea of bland auto designs. No, I still haven't gotten use to the minivan stigma, but boy once they ride in it, the critics convert quickly. Interesting that other makers are rushing this look to market. Can't wait to see what MB does at mid-cycle to freshen the front end. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Have been driving the R350 for a year now. Consistently getting 23-24 mpg with my daily commute at 70-75 mph. Great highway cruiser with good comfort (AC/Interior). Fold down seats work quite well. Car has had a crown steer pulling problem since new which they tell me to live with. MB nickel and dimes you on the options as well. Sliding rear doors and backup camera would be a big improvement as well as standard park distance (it is big and difficult to park).Decent value with $5000 incentive and Employee discount. Overpriced as compared to others in this segment. Great looking car with decent fit and finish.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The look is very similar to the Chrysler Pacifica. The diesel engine is quiet, but the 7 speed transmission can be a little slushy and stumbled changing gears during easy acceleration (needed a reprogram). Everything seems to be tied to the computer, from the radio to the taillights. Needs to be able to readily accept a trailer hitch and harness. Some of the driver controls need better ergonomics such as the seat adjustment, clock, radio. AND there are counterintuitive RED lights to indicate a climate control function is operating. Bluetooth should be standard in a car of this class. Parktronic is essential due to poor sightlines.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded in out 2004 Jeep GC Limited for the MB R-Class and I could not be happier! This vehicle handles beautifully and while the styling may not be for everyone, I find it very attractive. I was considering the Volvo SUV or Audi Q7 but fell in love once I test drove the MB (and got great incentives to buy, too). You don't see yourself coming and going in this car, which I like, plus it handles more like a car (dare I say sports car?) than most SUVs I have driven. The ride is comfortable, the interior is well-finished and luxurious, seating and leg room is ample, and cargo space is generous. There should be more standard options, considering the base price, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Love the comfort and drive of the R- Class. Especially highway driving. Enjoy the cruise controls. Love the better fuel mileage. Heavy car, little road nose. Comfort with four adults and two children. Very quiet engine, for a diesel, but powerful. Most people are surprised its a diesel, it's so quiet. Would only own this car in a diesel, due to power and fuel mileage. Drives like a dream.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I was happily surprised with how this vehicle drives as I was not initially impressed with its looks. In fact my husband said it looked like a hearse. After test driving it, I had my husband test drive it and he fell in love! (We did test drive the diesel as well and my husband found it to be noisier). The car drives like a dream! It is hard to park in tight spaces (hard to see the nose of the car) and it is too easy to switch gears accidently when driving (suggested improvement). All and all, would highly recommend.</TEXT>

<TEXT>There is some turbo lag until 2000rpms. Transmission shifts sluggishly when using comfort mode. Sport mode is a notable improvement.

<TEXT>This is an excellent crossover, which Mercedes named it the "Grand Sports Tourer" uniquely classified-like no other. Let's start with exterior and will work our way to the interior. Got the Premium Package 1 includes: panorama sunroof, automatic rear pop- out windows, dual shade sunvisors, pwr tailgate, TeleAid, harman/kardon Logic7 sound system, rear audio controls, Sirius satellite radio, hands-free communication system - bluetooth adapter..awesome clarity. Superb ride and comfort but the engine while inside the cabin was a bit loud and more noticeable but overall the R350 gets two thumbs up from me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We previously owned a mini-van and were looking at both station wagons and mini-vans when we found the R350. It had the smoothest ride of any car I have ever driven, and was not much more expensive than a Honda Odyssey, our second choice. We immediately took it on a 2,000 mile trip from Southern California to Oregon for a week of camping. We were impressed with how much gear we could fit in the back while also carrying two adults and two children. Everyone at the campground was coming by to check out the car because of its impressive exterior styling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have been driving the R350 for a year now. Consistently getting 23-24 mpg with my daily commute at 70-75 mph. Great highway cruiser with good comfort (AC/Interior). Fold down seats work quite well. Car has had a crown steer pulling problem since new which they tell me to live with. MB nickel and dimes you on the options as well. Sliding rear doors and backup camera would be a big improvement as well as standard park distance (it is big and difficult to park).Decent value with $5000 incentive and Employee discount. Overpriced as compared to others in this segment. Great looking car with decent fit and finish.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The look is very similar to the Chrysler Pacifica. The diesel engine is quiet, but the 7 speed transmission can be a little slushy and stumbled changing gears during easy acceleration (needed a reprogram). Everything seems to be tied to the computer, from the radio to the taillights. Needs to be able to readily accept a trailer hitch and harness. Some of the driver controls need better ergonomics such as the seat adjustment, clock, radio. AND there are counterintuitive RED lights to indicate a climate control function is operating. Bluetooth should be standard in a car of this class. Parktronic is essential due to poor sightlines.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We traded in out 2004 Jeep GC Limited for the MB R-Class and I could not be happier! This vehicle handles beautifully and while the styling may not be for everyone, I find it very attractive. I was considering the Volvo SUV or Audi Q7 but fell in love once I test drove the MB (and got great incentives to buy, too). You don't see yourself coming and going in this car, which I like, plus it handles more like a car (dare I say sports car?) than most SUVs I have driven. The ride is comfortable, the interior is well-finished and luxurious, seating and leg room is ample, and cargo space is generous. There should be more standard options, considering the base price, though. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We have one child and another on the way. We owned a Cherokee & a G35. We decided the two cars were unnecessary. We had been looking at XC90, Pilot, Odyssey, X5, ML, etc. We weren't planning on buying until the Spring or Summer, but after visiting the MB showroom we were so impressed by the R and the fantastic end of year incentives, we bought it. It costs me less per month than my G35 did! The R is wonderful and a perfect replacement for both my old cars. Home Depot trip? Drop all the seats and I have more room than in the jeep (I use a heavy duty blanket to protect). We love road trips and have big families. Perfect for long excursions. MB Safety. My family loves the R.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Panoramic sunroof, qualtiy, comfort and the fun "Party Bus" feeling when traveling with many people. Although not fantastic on fuel, when you figure you don't need two cars anymore, you may be actually saving gas in the end. My insurance also dropped almost $125 a month!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This vehicle is better than advertised. Its ride is very smooth with power when it's needed. It handles well and has a tighter turning radius than expected. For the size of vehicle, the MPG is pretty good. Seats are very comfortable, especially the 2nd row seats -plenty of room. Our R-Class has plenty of options and it will take some time to learn, but it hasn't been too hard so far. Price was somewhat high, but not too far above some SUV's and lower than luxury SUV's. Meets our needs for a family of 5 extremely well and I highly recommend it for other families of similar size. </TEXT>

She wouldn't even consider the R class, looked too much like a van. So I brought one home anyway..and she came around to the idea of a large wagon. It fits the family of 5 perfectly and room for a friend. Interior is top notch, nice auto tailgate and panoramic roof. 2D Navigation is adequate. It is a joy to drive, looking forward to a long road trip. It is an evolutionary vehicle design, kids would never fit in smaller 3rd row.
