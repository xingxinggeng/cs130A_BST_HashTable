<TEXT>I will never purchase another Chrysler. Honda, here I come! Tried to support American cars for most of my life. This car has me swearing never again. Replaced a power window motor, the power steering motor and something else with in the steering wheel, had 2 bad tires (drove with a flat-sensor didn't come on), replaced brakes at 18K, it's in now for bad roof leaking in 3 spots and a sunroof rattle. Door plates surrounding the power window buttons are rubbing down/showing signs of wear (I never use them!) and so are the seats--I have 25K miles on the van- -mostly from 3 long trips!! I haven't even had it 2 yrs. Bad gas mileage-- not even 17 MPG. Worst car I've ever owned! Poorest quality!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DVD player for the kids--it's one of the only things that hasn't broken, although I can't work all of the features from the dash. You have to use the remote for some things.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Leased this vehicle in Feb. 07 and just mailed Chrysler the check to purchase it. My wife is the principal driver and she loves it. She would not even consider getting a new vehicle when the lease is up. Went 2 to dealers to look at new vehicles and she walked out because she has her heart set on keeping this vehicle. No problems at all. The only things done in 2 years of use is oil changes every 3,000 miles and front and rear brakes. Van is loaded with every option available in the Signature Series. The van is extremely practical, my only complaint is ITS A MINI VAN. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>I got a bad one</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I've owned quite a few automobiles/trucks over the years,but, this definitely has had the most problems.First,transmission rebuild at 13,000 miles.Now at 27,000 miles and the transmission will slap into 2nd gear at low speeds. Also, tie-rods replaced at 27,000 miles! Service adviser said probably because the tie- rods were made for cars and couldn't take the weight of the van. I've worked on cars myself and have NEVER seen a tie-rod go at 27,000 miles! Check the internet, I'm not the only one.I know foreign makes have there problems also,but,I'm really disappointed in a $32,000 vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We lease this Signature Series Touring T&C. My wife is the primary driver and she loves it. This vehicle replaced a 2004 Pacifica, which I loved. After 30,000 miles, the only maintenance other than oil changes has been front brake pads. Visibility is much better than the Pacifica. We have the navigation system, the DVD system, the satellite radio, leather interior, and sun roof. Lease ends in May and my wife likes this van so much, she wants to buy it rather than get a new one. Vehicle is comfortable to drive and ride in, the carrying capacity is unbelievable, and as much as I hate to admit, it is very good family vehicle (I never thought we would own a minivan). My only complaint gas mileage</TEXT>

<TEXT>We needed a second vehicle and decided on a mini van. After searching internet sources we settle on an 07 T&C with 15,000 miles. The day we went to see it a last minute check turned up the same model with only 5,000 on it. I was skeptical to say the least. It turned out to be a Chrysler exec car with 5,000 miles and still had the new car showroom smell. You can't fake that. We love it. Our other car is a Caddy Deville and while our van is not a Caddy, it is equally comfortable on long trips. The gas mileage with under 10,000 on it now is better than the Caddy.I am getting 20-22 mph in town and upwards of 25 on the highway. I can only wait until the mileage gets up there and better MPG.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stow and go of course. Upgraded fabrics and heated mirrows. Driving comfort and ease of control. I do not find the audio buttons on the back of the steering wheel hard to use. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Chrysler. I have a child in a wheelchair and this vehicle was the best as far as space available inside for chair and passengers. The first was bottom line and cheaper than other brand minivans. It gave me nothing but problems. The second time around I decided to get top of line, Chrysler Town and Country Touring, maxed out. Bad choice. It wasn't any better. Air conditioner poblems from leaking inside to blowing all kinds of ways, the shocks are horrible they actually squeek with every little bump. I went to have them replaced but are on back order. The ride is so rough. Gas mileage is horrible. Short in outlets and many others. This will be my last Chrysler and Dodge!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned a Touring for 15 months and no problems. Recently,the passenger side airbag light came on after I gave a ride to a 250 pound friend, my wife is 120 pounds. I think that was because of the Occupant Classification System. Good gas mileage on highway but very disappointing in town. I am very happy with the van's features, but the trip computer is a bit complicated--particularly to check out while on the road. I just moved my daughter into her college duplex. We had her things in storage over the summer, and I moved her things to the duplex. I thought it would take 5 or 6 trips, but we did it in two, an amazing amount of storage with the 2nd and 3rd row seats down.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I will never buy any Chrysler. This vehicle is been at the dealer multiple times for many problems, brakes, battery, AC, noises, vibrations, transmission, axles,and more. The service experience is been horrible. last time they had to replace the transmission torque converter for shifting problems and the service adviser said that the problem with a defective shaft was caused by not rotating the tires, what? They think people don't know how to search for information these days. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this van used with 18k on it. Was a rental for a car company. It is basic with few bells and whistles, but the fuel mileage is great! On a long trip of nearly 800 miles I averaged as high as 29.7 on interstate with three adults and two children in it! (headwind and hill changes it quickly) But there is no problem averaging 22.7 all around combined mileage. Very pleased with the fuel given the high price of gas. The interior is basic. Mid-row seats are kind of small and not a lot of room between 2nd and 3rd row, but we were used to a full-size conversion and it is a 'mini-van.' Pleased with our purchase and would recommend as an economical option for one with small children.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the 07 base T&C, in a pinch. I didn't do my research, I wish I did. I got the base model, and the only thing I got was the DVD system, BUT headphones weren't available for this trim (nor was the van wired for them). Bogus. Not only that, but there are no air conditioning vents in the back!! We had to get a clip fan from an autoparts store so my son wouldn't be so hot. Nobody warned me, also, that half of the van's value is lost in the first year, I paid 17k (+ some neg. equity) and a year later, I can't get more than 9k for it. 9!!! That's terrible. I am very unhappy and because of this I am never buying a Chrysler or minivan again. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Gas hog&amp;bad handling</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I really wish I would've taken my time in buying this vehicle. It handles horribly, it feels like the steering wheel goes side to side when driving. It veers the right, the dealership told me it was the tire pressure (not) its not fuel efficient. The seat belts on 2nd row seating make it hard for people to get to the 3rd row seating. Probably because its a bench seat, but that was bad engineering on Chryslers part. The side view mirrors are manual. Hello this is the millennium. So is the clock, you have to put a pen in the clock to change the time. Again, I was rushed, wish I would've taken my time. I wouldn't buy it again. Oh yeah the 2nd row seats sit so close the front row! No space for my kids!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is our second T&C van, amazingly I purchased this one new with more options than our first van which was a used Limited. The Stow and Go seating is great, but you give up seat comfort for this feature. Our old van seats where much softer and more comfortable. People are knocking power, but I just drove this 2000 miles on vacation at 80 MPH and never once did I feel underpowered! My family loves this car and with good maintenance fully expect it to last 10 years. Without a car payment for 5 of those years I will pay my kids college tuition.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the 3rd and the worst Town & Country I have owned. It rattles and chatters @40 mph in the front end. Dealer says it's the road, Loud and noisy front end, Dealer says that's normal. I had a old 50's pick- up truck that clunked and rattled less. Not fun to drive cause you are never sure if or when something in the front end is going to fall off or break. Excessive wind and road noise. Can't wait to trade it off for a modern vehicle</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have purchased this van for $17000 out the door. It had 20000 miles on it. I have owned sports car, luxury car, SUV and by far this is the best vehicle ever (comfort, storage, mpg etc) for this price. I was shooting for Toyota but could not touch anything with this year and mileage below $23000. Everybody is wanting more power. If you want to do passing at 80 mph maybe you need to consider sports car not a van. Rides like a luxury. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive a lot so I see good and bad about a vehicle. My 2nd minivan but 1st Chrysler. No above bars to assist getting in/out of vehicle, layout of radio and heat controls poor, window controls not good because very close to manual door lock. Seat is okay but behind neck is very uncomfortable. Tires have tread but terrible traction. Feel like vehicles not setting tight on the road. Radio poor reception. Vehicle often feels like it may stall and difficulty accelerating. Blind view areas. Layout of window defrost blows air in your eyes. Uneven dashboard near defrost vents and speakers causes bad reflections in sun. I strongly feel it will cause me to hit something on the right side.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I removed middle seat and moved read forward making it a 5 passenger vehicle. This gives me need cargo area. Rear interior width/height is great since wheel wells are not protruding into vehicle. Rear height makes it easy to get items like lawnmower in and out.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>With all the accolades surrounding the Chrysler mini-van, I expect a good vehicle. Instead, this vehicle seems to be a work in progress. The cruise control couldn't control the speed.

<TEXT>As much as I tried to like this minivan, I just can't and here's why. Buzzy engine when downshifting to pass other cars at freeway speeds. Scared my wife more than once when downshifting. Steering wheel controls at the back of the steering wheel? Not very intuitive. Very soft suspension. Not inspiring a lot of confidence while driving around the mountains of Denver, CO. Not even full leather seating surfaces or if it is, I can't tell. The main seat was leather but the side edges on the seat top felt suspiciously like vinyl. Yes, having legacy worker benefits to support does take away from the competitiveness of this minivan compared to others.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my third T/C lease, and it seems they've been getting more boring, less powerful, less fuel efficient, but with all the familiar shortcomings. Warped rotors that will need turning/replacing at 25-30K, barge-like handling, barely adequate brakes, and a woefully underpowered 6- speaker sound system. The only time I'm happy in this car is when I've got passengers and gear, and I'm travelling on the highway in a straight line. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my Lexus RX300 for a minivan. This has all the features I had plus more (DVD and auto doors/trunk). I love that the doors open so I don't have to fool with my 14 month old, diaper bag, infant (w/carrier), and shopping bags. It's not as lush as the Lexus, but it gets the job done. It's loaded, but still not comparable. I wish there was a higher end model that felt like a luxury SUV inside.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2007 is our third T&C - traded in our 1997 with 150,000+ miles on it - still running. We also have a 2003 T&C that has been problem-free. Looked at others but there's no way they have the comfort, reliablity and features the T&C has. The leather stow n go seats are quite a bit more comfortable than those in a 2005 touring version I have ridden in - not bad at all. We will be looking forward to not removing seats every time we want to haul something or take our dogs for an extended drive. The quality of the leather on T&C's seats is also a cut above other vans and it's a quieter minivan than others. It's a good value for us.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stow n go, second row seats move all the way back to bench for maximum legroom and also recline. Climate control, sun roof great. In older T&C models, if you manually opened the power door and then pressed the button to close, nothing happened. Now, the door opens all the way and closes. Great. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our 2nd Town and Country. Loved the first and hope this one is as good as that one was. Like driving it. Miss the hand grips above. Stow and go is really a great feature, but you give up comfort in the back seats. Mileage on old van was 18 around town. Don't expect to do much better with this or any other van. No trips required back to the dealer for quality issues.. amazing.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stow and go seating is great. Like the Sirius radio and sound system. Seems to me to be the quietest of vans, very little road, engine, or wind noise. Thought the power doors were gimmicky at first.. but really like them now.</FAVORITE>

I do not know the problem everyone has with power but there is enough here. If I need more then I am in the wrong place doing something I should not.

<TEXT>We have had several Chrysler Minivans and have been pleased until this one. We must have purchased it too quickly. All of the seats are not as comfortable as any of the others (not as much padding. The 3rd seat is embarrassing to friends, it cuts the ack of my legs and my toes touch to back of the second seat. I am 4 ft.11". Also there are no hand pulls inside, which is bad for us and our friends. Maxine Kiger</TEXT>

After 11,000 miles the Toyota was rattling like it was going to fall apart. The engine sounded like it had marbles in it. The doors never closed right from the beginning. I went looking for a new van, and after driving the Toyota and Honda, the Chrysler won hands down. I want to trade my Accord for a new Sebring, too. No more boring Japanese for me.</TEXT>
