<TEXT>The 2007 GTI is a very well made car, the only significant repair after 90K miles was rear wheel bearings. There was also a problem with the PCV valve which was fixed under a service bulletin. The car also loses or burns some oil - not unexpected for a turbo, I guess, but you must check the oil regularly. Numerous interior squeaks and rattles were corrected after I replaced the horrid stock Continental tires with BFG SuperSport A/S and then Goodyear Eagle GT A/S. Ride and handling are great, the stability control is excellent. No steering feel due to the electric steering, but you learn to live without it. An almost perfect, practical sporty 4- dr hatch at a reasonable price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great torque and tall gearing make it a joy to shift through the gears with both power and reasonable fuel economy. Perfect for point-and-squirt moves through traffic. The dual-zone climate control (not offered in other years) is great - not expected in this price range. Always solid and stable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Its just a fine piece of engineering. This car feels absolutely solid and locked on to the road. Driving becomes more intuitive when the car goes exactly where you point it, when you point it. Anyone who has ever driven an American car should be familiar with the amount of sag or 'play' between the actual motion of the steering wheel and whats transmitted to the wheels. That's what makes German cars so awesome - wheels turn with the drivers hands. The DSG is just about the most underrated technological innovation ever. This trans is a blast, blowing through gears at speeds previously unimaginable for any gearbox. Learn about how the dual clutch works -- its worth the education.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My GTI has been with me for two years and 17K miles, and the experience has been positive. This is the original "hot hatch", the benchmark for this class. If you're looking for outright performance, go for a Mazdaspeed 3. But if you're seeking European character and sophistication, the choice is clear. The GTI goes about its business in a most German way. Feels solid as a bank vault when you get in and shut the door. On the interstate, it's unflappable and deceptively fast, so invest in a good radar detector. This model has ceased production, as the sixth-generation is already out and headed to the US in the fall of 2010. There should be many pre-owned examples to choose from.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE> Engine sounds great under full throttle. GTI built in Germany, not Mexico as previous model. Xenon headlamps standard. High quality exterior paint finish. Beefy steering wheel you want to caress. Full-size spare tire. Elegant enough for the country club valet, if the occasion were to arise.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My '07 GTI is the most enjoyable new car I have ever owned. It's the perfect size and I've got plenty of space for people and cargo, too. VW styling never gets old and the retro interior is cool, comfortable and durable. The DSG is best auto-manual transmission ever made. It makes the car feel sporty without making me feel tired. It's a sports car that doesn't beat you up. But stick to the base car and skip the leather package. Otherwise you have a $30K GTI.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the GTI to have a fun car to drive while still being able to live with it day by day. It has more than enough power for the street. Quick steering and an easy to use 6-speed gear box, but the clutch travel is long. There is a huge aftermarket to tweak the car to exactly how you want it. Fits four people with ease. The hatch is a bit small compared to my last car's trunk, but cavernous once the rear seats fold down. Adequate 6-disc CD stereo for a non-audiophile. I've had no mechanical problems. The biggest problem with owning the car is how expensive maintenance can be, especially if down at the dealer, but the recommended 10,000 miles between oil changes helps with that.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powertrain. Interior accent lights at night. 30+ mpg easily achieved if driven with care. Much fun if driven without care. Big aftermarket. Multi-Function Display in dash for car info (mpg, etc), radio control, and car options.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had my GTI for almost two years now, and it's easily the finest car I've ever driven. There were so many duds that followed the 1983 original, but Volkswagen finally got serious again about this iconic model. The engine is the star here, propelling what's not a light vehicle with gusto. It pulls from below 2000 rpm, which means there's virtually no turbo lag. Great car for darting around Manhattan traffic, but the open road is where it shines. Buckets of torque make passing a breeze, and the VW is unflappable at high speed. Overall reliability has been surprisingly solid. Fuel economy has been atrocious.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The GTI is amazing. gets better with age. Perfect for urban areas-- park it anywhere. Equally at home ripping down curvy country roads in the mountains or cruising on the highway. Equipped with winter wheels/tires/roof box it easily can take four skiing or riding. Cruising range over 400 miles-fill ups are infrequent. VW put the money where it counts in this new gti. The handling is crisp and predictable. Squirt through some traffic and take the exit a little faster or go for a Sunday drive and enjoy motoring with the windows down and sunroof open. Sound and options could be better. If you can only own one car this is it. buy it used and save some $. Fun and reliable. kids luv it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've got 2,000 miles on my GTI and she makes me smile! I'm 6'1" and I fit into the car nicely with plenty of space to go around, and still feel I'm part of the car. A lot of attention is paid in the finish details like a luxury car. In my shopping stage, it took me awhile to get over the stigma of the VW reliability that I heard from EVERYONE, but after doing a lot of research, the GTI is probably the BEST BET in the VW market. I got the candy white 4 door, and it's a beauty! The DSG transmission makes driving an auto more fun than it should be, however it takes time to get use to it, but it's a whole new experience. For city livin' and city drivin', this is the best practical and FUN car for my needs!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The DSG transmission and performance, steering wheel, plaid cloth (I like it), plenty of space for a compact car, 4-doors are a must for me, red calipers, and good gas mileage, telescopic steering wheel. This car is a great mix of speed and practicality.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>There is an unbelievable difference between the 1.8L turbo (170hp) in my Passat and the 2.0L Turbo (200hp) in this GTI. It also feels a lot stronger than the 2.0L Turbo (210hp) that I had in my 2002 WRX, and overall is a much nicer car than the WRX, quicker off the line, better quality materials throughout, and you always feel in complete control of the GTI. This GTI wants to move out fast whether you have the DSG Auto transmission in normal drive mode, sport mode or manual shift mode. It shifts silky smooth in all three modes. The paddle shifters on the steering wheel are more toys than anything else, but really fun ones!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the 2.0L turbo engine and the DSG auto transmission that combine to make this one fast Rabbit. Also, like the four doors, which makes the back seat very accessible and usable.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is fun to drive. It's quick and nimble, and goes fast in a hurry. The seats are great. If you drive in the city, the automatic is perfect. They finally made a GTI like it's supposed to drive. Get it with four doors, drop the kids off at school and spend the day zipping around town. It's also under the radar screen, people look but don't oogle. It's really a prefect car. Let's see how it does on the long term. The people at VW still need to work on service.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched this car for months and looked at many different competitors, all of which averaged twice the price. After researching every scrap of opinion available, I came to want this car. My research somewhat prepared me for it, but the first drive took me out of this world. The performance to price ratio in this car makes it a lion, and the pure enjoyment of feeling the 200hp acceleration, really puts it in a class far above the price point. If you have "low ego emissions" and want something REALLY fun to drive, go GTI. You can't go wrong with this car. It's simply amazing, and the voluminous articles out there in the rags have NOT steered me wrong. I love this car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The DSG transmission is awesome. Somehow (maybe double clutch) it smooths out driving at low speeds while retaining the juice. It feels taut inside (apparently it is assembled in Germany in contrast to almost all other VW models). Unfortunately, the stereo display is third world and the Sirius trial is worthless because you only have a sample of channels. The sunroof could be bigger. The interior trim is spare, bordering on cheap. I see part of the reason why the A3 goes for more. I have the cloth, which is alright, but the seats don't feel like they'd treat me well on a long drive. I am glad that I chose the 4-door. It is not bigger than the 2-door, but seems to get more out of the rear row while maintaining near identical trunk space.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The VW GTI is more fun to drive than the BMW 325i and it holds four comfortably with room for the dog in the hatch. It even costs about $15,000 less than a similarly-equipped BMW. It is larger and cheaper than the Audi A3. It is almost as much fun to drive as the Mini Cooper S, but sized for non-hobbits. It has the best transmission available - period. I have had it for only one month and 800 miles, but it has no rattles, squeaks, or problems of any kind. Its gas mileage has been 27 mpg combined using manual shift/sport mode and a heavy foot. It gets 30+ on the highway.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the best GTI ever. It is so much fun to drive. It has amazing handling. If you are over 40 years old - stay away from 18" tires - they make the ride too rough. If you don't want to spend on winter tires and change them before every winter - stay away from 18" tires. Other than that, this is probably the most bang for your buck in a long time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've never owned an "auto" tranny car until my DSG-equipped GTI. I was injured and couldn't work a clutch for a couple months. But I also club race and like control and performance. I also need to haul music gear and my 10 year old son to the beach, etc. This car does all of it and then some. It offers great luxury with the leather, heated seats, and climate control. The 2.0T engine has plenty of punch and the DSG transmission is a chameleon: drive it easy in D, harder in S, or full in manual mode with the paddle shifters. I drove an A3 also (same platform) but the GTI was more fun to drive *and* has more headroom, shoulder room, and more room in the back. I highly recommended this car. My other car is a '79 Porsche 911 that I'll never sell.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This car is awesome. It has 200 hp and 207 lb. feet of torque! It gets up and goes. For those of you who are worried about reliability consider this: previous models where built in Mexico, this GTI is built in Wolfsburg, Germany. Its handling is top notch for a car that weighs 3,000 lbs. It is faster than its main competitor, the Honda Civic Si.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The luxury interior, satellite radio through the head unit, controls on the steering wheel, and the engine sounds and performs great! I love this car's back seat room, 6 disc in dash CD and MP3 player. The iPod link that charges instead of having to used the cig lighter outlet is neat. The metalic paint job is top notch.</FAVORITE>

It is very powerful, handles corners great, the interior is very comfortable, it has a quiet ride, gets good gas mileage, is safe, etc. It comes with built in Sirius Satellite radio. I was concerned about the electrical issues VWs are known for when researching cars, but was reassured by the fact that the GTI is made only in Germany and that the electrical issues have been addressed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>From the moment I test drove one of these I had to have one. I drove a 2003 A4 before this and this car blows my Audi away! This car is near perfect from the factory, however, if I could recommend two things to current owners to make it PERFECT: Eibach Pro-kit springs and APR Stage I chip. Period. The springs lower the car about 1" and the chip adds about 45 HP and roughly 80-90 ft lbs. of torque (as if it doesn't have enough already:) which is just enough to bring the performance up to a level that allows this car to compete with 350Z's, G35's, Boxsters, 330Cis, and even IS300's. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The smooth turbo and power delivery are unmatched in the industry, The handling / cornering (the Eibach springs help a lot with body roll) and the aggressive stance that it has are great. I get more looks with this car than my in my Audi.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The new GTI comes now in a four door model. The 2006 and 2007 modles have the new 2.0L turbocharged engine with 200 HP insted of the old 2006-2002 modles which had the 1.8L turbocharged engines with about 170HP. The turbocharger adds a lot of gas milage and gives it a lot of all around power. The exterior looks awesome, it looks very fast, don't you think, even the new 4 door version. The new Honda Civic Si is cool, but it does not have the turbocharger and the GTI gives you a lot more space for luggage. The rims avalible on the GTI are also way better than the Honda. That's what I think anyhow. I am not saying that the Honda is a is bad or anything, in fact Hondas are great cars but the Volkswagen GTI is the way to go.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love that it has an input so you can plug in your iPod. The paddles are also very cool, most cars don't have that where you can shift gears without taking your hand off the wheel. The plaid seat are in style and are very comfortable. The grill is also really cool with the red pin-stripe.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The combination of the versatility of the DSG transmission (spring for the extra grand) with an amazingly torquey engine, makes this one special car for the price. The four door version, in my opinion, improves its profile over the two door model, not to mention it adds utility. The GTI's fit and finish are of the highest quality. It's a better looking than the Audi A3 for about eight grand less. The only downside so far is that collision insurance (as with most VW's) costs quite a bit more than average.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just got it and am loving it. I broke the 600 mile mark (safety purposes) and starting to break it in. She wants to go, that's all there is to it. I thought about getting the automatic, but missed the clutch and it's cheaper (1,075). It holds corners well, I would just like a little more response through the steering wheel. It has amazing leg room in the back. The shoulder room does not accommodate three sets of broad shoulders (being an ex-swimmer, it's hard to find that in a small car). With the seats down you have more room than you expect. I almost bought Mazda3. The GTI is a little more money but makes up for it in style and power.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car with 19,000 miles, trading in a BMWX3. If you drive it conservatively, it's comfortable, economical, the hatch makes it versatile and it provides a lot of amenities that you get with more expensive cars. When you want it, the power and handling are terrific. The ride is a bit rough on rough roads but that was expected with low profile tires. I have had owned several sports sedans but always thought the power came at the expense of handling. This car makes a lot of sense and I could not be happier. Finally, one unexpected benefit is the cloth seats which are cooler than leather in the summer sun. The car cools quickly after a stint in a parking lot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am 6'5 and this car proved itself to be great, roomy, sporty, economical and attractive. I traded my VW Gti 337 Ed, due to thinking that it will break down as soon as I run out of warranty. Unfortunately I should have kept it. After 7 months of ownership the '07 GTi came across an issue, a clunking noise in the front of the suspension. I went to research this on a vw forum and it turns out plenty of people have this problem. I attempted to fix this under warranty & even dealt with VWOA and no fix has been found, better yet it couldn't been replicated despite the fact that I had proof on video of many random recurrence and having a service manager replicated it to the quality rep from vw.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Always wanted a GTI since the MK1 in 1983, finally got one almost 25 years later and I got the special edition. Wahooo, power/Torque is incredible for a 4 cyl turbo hatchback, reliability is perfect (currently have 27,000 miles on it after 10 months of ownership and the only issue i have had is figuring out where I'm going to drive next - best car i have ever owned, dead serious. I have driven it through death valley and into the yosemite valley, from Vegas to Denver and even up a dirt mountain driveway ( with snow chains ) and it has never failed me. The exhaust note is great and I added a K&N Intake which makes it sound even better. Suspension is stiff and sporty but pliable for long trips.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After testing many cars (Fit, Mazda 3, Accord, Passat, Legacy, A3) I decided to go with the GTI 4-door. I don't regret my purchase in the least. The car is a lot of fun to drive and the seating position is great. The powertrain is fantastic, with torque available everywhere, and the DSG is flawless. The car has a nice compromise of ride quality and handling. The interior is ergonomically perfect except for cruise control, and is made out of high quality materials (and the plaid seats are a plus). The hatchback design is very versatile and manages to hold items that would just not fit in a sedan. Fuel economy is better than the 2007 EPA rating. 14K mi trouble free and only 1 minor rattle!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Have owned the car for 4 months and already had 1 recall, rear windshield wiper stop working, passenger door seal came off, airbag fault. Dealer had to replace the harness.For a new car with 3500 mile I'm not impressed. Have always owned Hondas or Subaru and the Germans have got a bit of catching up to do. Oil filter is in an inconvenient place. You need to remove the shield on the bottom of the engine for access and it cost $12. Car lacks top end. Handles nice but awd would be a plus. Nice styling, comfortable seats, convenience of hatchback, My first and probably last VW</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had this car for one year. Fun car to drive, and its utility has been important to me. The gas mileage is reasonable for the engine performance as well. Excellent fit and finish, and only one questionable item in terms of any defect, which has not been a problem. I wanted a car with a sunroof, still having reasonable headroom. That put the Hondas (Civic and Accord coupes) out of contention, by comparison.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine's torque and flexibility are outstanding. The shifter is smooth, not as short throw as perhaps a few other manual transmissions, but not bad. Good room in the useful back seats, which split-fold. Interior materials are first-rate in this price range. Plenty of headroom for tall folks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The GTI is really a great car. The good outweighs the bad and the car is the first of many that I want to hang on to. My only real problem with the car is the many dash noises and some weird sounds that keep coming up from time to time. The quality of the interior is sound and not cheap plastic. I can't understand why this car makes sounds that seem not to be an easy fix. It seems so solid. Overall you won't be sorry. This cars gets tons of attention no matter where you go.

The acceleration, handling, and braking are all top notch. It feels like driving a car that costs 2x what the GTI costs. The seats are incredibly comfortable and offer excellent support for cornering and for long drives. The stereo rocks, and the displays and controls are well designed and easy to use.

<TEXT>Package 1, 18" hufs, vortex body kit, wow... this car is well sorted. Power is smooth and plentiful, tranny is lovely, not notchy in the least. And the handling/brakes are great bone stock. I was considering a WRX, Mazdaspeed3 (which my brother owns and loves it as well), and a few others. I drove the GTI and feel in love. Having been a long time VW owner (I currently own), I was happy to see the GTI is made in Germany. I've just made it past the break-in period, so I'm finally able to do some spirited driving and I couldn't be happier (well, AWD would have made this car perfect, but hey we can't have it all). This car was built to drive. I smile every time I get in.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the GTI for three months now and I can honestly say it's a blast to drive, and with four doors, it's very practical as well. This is my first manual transmission car in 18 years and I'm really enjoying shifting on my own again. The car has plenty of power and very little turbo lag. Build quality is excellent and I've had no issues with reliability. I was tempted to get a BMW 335i, but in Northern Virginia where I live it seems that every other car is a BMW 3 series so the GTI is a nice change and the price is extremely reasonable for what you get. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I owned my 2007 VW GTI for about 6 months and it's been in for repairs well over 2 months in total. The information center was defective. It took over a week to replace. Most serious problem could be related to the engine, transmission, turbo - don't yet know the source. The dealer can't identify the problem and VW tech support has been useless. Possibly related to heat, since it occurs most often when the temperature is high. As you step on the gas the car drops out of gear and will not respond. It feels like you are slamming on the brakes, according to my friend who was driving with me during one of these "seizures". This is a very serious safety issue. Car was bought back by the dealer.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like this car because it follows my driving moods. Sometimes, I just like to adjust the climate, put it in drive, turn on Sirius Disorder and drive it like a normal car. And it does this marvelously. When I do this, it's fairly easy to get 30 mpg or more (according to the car's computer). Sometimes, I like to pick my own gears, put the windows down and the sunroof back, crank up Alt Nation and strap a brick to my shoe. It handles this impressively as well. And will still get around 27 mpg. No matter how I feel like driving, this car just delivers a great drive. It looks and feels rock solid. There's little features VW doesn't even flaunt giving me the impression of attention to details.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DSG is brilliant! This dual-clutch automated manual tranny truly is the future of changing gears, if it proves to have a comparable lifespan. 2.0T is uber impressive.

<TEXT>This car is not only a speedy sport compact but a very comfortable car for around town driving as well as commuting. Don't get me wrong, I bought this car because it is flat out fun to drive but it also has tremendous gas mileage too. If you stay off the turbo, you can easily get 30 mpg on the freeway and 26 on the streets. I have driven a few tiptronic transmission cars but nothing that compares. Simply put the car in sport mode, grip the wheel and hold on, no turbo lag. I am a pretty tall guy, over 6' tall, but I can ride comfortably in any seat in the car. The color of the fahrenheit really polarizes folks. It is a love or hate thing but most people will tell you that this car is sharp.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>2.0T engine is great, (look at the numbers, this car does not give up much from the R32 and weighs about 500lbs less), DSG gearbox, Xenon headlights are nice, gauges look good as does the entire interior, SAT radio, MP3 adapter, and the color is loud.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've put almost 2000 m. on my GTI. The more I drive it, the more I like it. It's great fun. VW should be applauded for building a terrific car for reasonable $. There is really no competition for the GTI, except for its cousin, the Audi A3. The GTI is quick and handles great; it even sounds wonderful - similar to a Honda VTEC at high rpm and it has a low growl when you give it some gas at low rpm. The rest of the time, it's quiet, as it should be. The build quality is excellent, too. The Civic Si, is no match for the VW in every day driving. The VW has much more low/mid range torque. It's a joy to drive and the Civic would be a chore. And, the GTI's hatchback design is much more practical.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first VW I have ever owned and by far the greatest car I have ever had in my possession.The around town gas mileage has been about 26-28 mpg and 3 people are kind of cramped but the ride and handling make this vehicle shine. Long road trips have been a dream getting close to 460 miles on a full tank of premium gas. The dealer-only oil changes have been a little steep ($90 for the first and $170 for the second) but knowing that the car is handled correctly and will last me a long time has made it worth it. Knowing what I know now I would purchase this vehicle again and I love the looks I get from people watching me whiz by them. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the feel of the leather seats the response of the handling when I take sharp turns & the hum of the engine. The GTI is much better to ride in w/ the windows down & the sunroof open.

<TEXT>I did a lot of researching for my car and finally decided on the GTI. I wanted something fuel efficient, cool looking, fast, but not too pricey. Compared to any Honda (Civic, Accord), Mazda (3), Mini Cooper and Audi (A3), this car by far took the cake. Some of the best handling I've ever experienced. This is an extremely fun and fast car which has a very subtle look about it, but shines when you'd like it to. VW may not be on peoples' radar for amazing cars, but the GTI has my full backing 100%. This is easily the best investment I've ever made. </TEXT>

The fuel economy is great too for a car like this, about 25 mpg in mixed driving. Decent cargo in the back too, my golf clubs can fit back there! Rear seat room is good also for adults, as long as they're not too tall. Comfortable seats, even though I don't understand why the lumbar support is the only power operation. Pretty good base stereo. There is a blind spot over the right shoulder that can be aggravating on the highways.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I decided to purchase the GTI because it is a great combination of performance, practicality, and value. The engine pulls strongly into triple-digit speeds, the handling on the 17 inch rims all season tires is good, though if pushed it displays typical front wheel drive understeer. The ride is firm but not punishing, and the fit and finish are difficult to fault. Fuel mileage has been quite good. Only complaint has been a gear noise while parked with the transmission in neutral, but this seems to be unusual, and has not affected operation one bit.</TEXT>

The ride is a little stiff at highway speeds, however if I have the family (2+2) with me the ride is better. I have the 4 door so it is much more practical then 2 doors.

The DSG transmission would also be a good choice. I have the 18" wheels with aggressive tires. The ride would be a bit better with the all-seasons.

The ride is a little stiff, especially on city streets, but not prohibitive. I don't have any problems with rattles or the radio, which I think sounds great! My only complaints are the iPod adapter - not super user friendly. The seats could be more adjustable - I am petite. It could use more storage space in the armrest and the price of premium gas.

<TEXT>I've put the first 1000 mi on my GTI and I have to say I have no regrets in purchasing this machine. The list of standard features is too long to write. The performance is all around. Great kick starting at about 2k rpms. I average around 30 mpg. The cabin is quiet with the windows up. You only hear the engine when you really push it. I myself have experienced no rattles up to now. Seats hold you in place but the bolstering also makes it hard to get out. Brake pedal feel is a little too soft for me.

<TEXT>I have been fixated on an Audi A3 since I saw them in Europe, and when I found out that they were coming to the states I had to have one, that is until I drove the GTI. The A3 was a little too refined for my taste, granted it is luxurious but it seems like a car that is easy to forget. The GTI however has all the classic makings of the cult phenomenon seen in the previous model, sure it's got a bit of wind noise (way less than previous gen), but if you had too much insulation you wouldnt be able to hear the growl of the exhaust... and if you have ever ridden in a tuned classic beetle you know it's almost deafening but fun as hell. They made a great modern performance platform and kept the VW soul.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sirius radio, steering wheel mounted computer and radio controls, mute button for radio, DSG, paddle shift, growl of exhaust, T U R B O, the look on the faces of Mustang boys when a Vee Dub hatch flies past em.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Back to a VW again</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>We traded in our 2002 Jetta 1.8 turbo for a PT Cruiser GT. We missed the VW performanace after the deal was done. Three years later we sold the PT and purchased a GTI with DSG. We put 1100 miles on it before we took it on a trip to Calif from Wa State. The GTI was a pleasure on the whole trip. Plenty of power, cornered well and we got 29.5 MPG on our 2500 mile trip. This car was well worth the investment. I tried to buy a bra for the trip but they don't make one yet, however after returning home and scrubbing the car I was delighted that there was not one chip on the front end (nice design ). Try one and you will be sold. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Turbo power and DSG. Leather pkg and dual heating and air controls for both passengers. 18" wheels were worth it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Since I was a teenager I drove an '84 VW Scirocco. Later in life, for work related reasons I needed a 4X4 so I got a Liberty (mistake!) and parked my VW for restoration. I've missed it ever since. Nothing drives like a VW and never more has this been true than with their new 2007 GTI. In the short time I've had it, it's earned the title of "Car of the Year" to me. Performance is top-notch, the styling and interior is beautiful; it has the feel of a much more expensive auto. It's solid on the road and sticks to it when taking corners. You feel safe, secure, and you know you're getting value for your money. The 2007 GTI gets fabulous gas mileage and has actually brought fun back to the daily commute.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power and agility of this car are explosive. The interior is stocked with amazing extras, a large glovebox, driver side storage, sunglass holder, and a wicked trip computer with compass. My sore back adores the standard heated seats and the retro GTI plaid is a wonderful touch. I love this car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Ordered my GTI to get all the features I desired (took 4 months from order to delivery). The GTI is a joy to drive. DSG transmission is flawless. Switches and controls feel particularly solid. Experience only minor turbo lag (when engine accelerates from less than ~2000 rpm). Above 2000 rpm you feel like you're in a rocket! While car can take regular gas, performance is clearly enhanced with premium. After 1200 miles, getting 26-27 mpg for mostly highway driving (75-80 mph). Car is very quiet at speed. Optional 17 inch low profile all season tires are significantly less stiff than the summer tires. Excellent integration of radio and nav system with instrument panel display. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DSG transmission with option for fully automatic, automatic with sport mode or manual control with paddle shifters. Get good gas mileage while allowing rapid acceleration when needed. Multifunction display between gauges with steering wheel controls for radio and MFD keep your eyes on the road. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted to trade down from a Passat and was interested a sport hatch. Looked at Mini Cooper, Mazda3 5 door and Audi A3 as well as Acura TSX. The GTI 5 door is the A3 without the steep price tag and the roof-length sunroof. This car is tremendous value. If you want leather, you'll pay about the same as you would for the Acura. Stick to the traditional plaid cloth, it's not only retro, it's comfortable and durable.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>DSG, turbo, supportive front seats, grip when cornering, maneuverability in parking lots. Formula 1 steering wheel with paddle shifts is real cool. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As a German, I am very particular about my cars. Though I do not automatically dismiss non-German cars, I prefer the ride and fun of the German auto. This VW is no exception. I love how it was made in Wolfsburg, Germany. The styling is great. It is a complete blast to drive. I wish the Americans would build an Autobahn! I am short but have tall family and friends. They all fit in with no problem. The four door is great, and I can fit so much cargo in the trunk. I love the 18" wheels with the red brake callipers and adore the red stripe on the grill. If you live in a state that requires two license plates I recommend forego the front one. Looks much better!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sporty ride - sport mode is heaven. Red accents, drive feel, amazing engine and power, styling, the leather seats are very good grip. Also, the cup holders are perfect size even in America! Great stereo system. OH! The latch to open the hatch is so cool! It is the VW badge that flips up! Love!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I initially went just to see what the hype was about and fell in love after the test drive. I was going to look at the Civic Si, but didn't even get out of the VW place with out the car. Took the one off the show room floor, #269 out of 1200. The car is really fun to drive. The seats are really comfortable. This is my first VW and definitely won't be my last. The DSG auto trans is really fun to play with when you want to do just that... play! I actually look forward to driving again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>At first I was a bit scared to get a FWD, turbo, German car. But I'm convinced that this truly is the Car of the Year. It's just so well balanced, well made, fun to drive, loaded with features, and affordable. There's nothing to hate perhaps except that you can't drift with it as easy as you'd like... but I can get over that easy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this car since Nov. It is everything that I hoped for and more. A real pleasure to drive on the twisties, and around town to work. I was down to either this or the Audi A3, which has worse ergonomics, worse visibility - but cool sunroof. Glad that I went with the VW. A few rattles here and there, but I am really particular, so take that with stride. The summer tires that come with the car are just that - poor once the weather cools off. The 6 speed manual is AMAZING - why someone would go for the DSG is beyond me. Highly recommended!!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've been for service ten times already in five months. Granted, everything is covered under warranty, but the hassle of coming in for burnt out LED's, airbag lights, wind noise, ticking sounds, immobilizer malfunctions, radio, squeaks and rattles (and I mean a lot!)... etc is really annoying. Also, I never imagined that a car like this would have so many design quirks. I can't name them all, I only have 250 words left. To paraphrase, you'll waste a lot of gas, a lot of tires, a lot of windshield washer fluid, a lot of your time and a lot of your money to fix problems. When I first received my car I had two scratches on the door and center console, and glue all over the inside of the roof.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First of all, to be honest I never thought I would own a VW. I went and test drove an '07 Civic Si, but found it to be lacking in the torque department. I also considered the Scion tC but found it to be lacking the quality of the Toyotas that I have owned before. When I first test drove the GTI I was surprised by how smooth and refined the power was. It doesn't require you to downshift every time you need to pass since it makes so much torque and at such low rpm. There is NO lag that I can tell. The cabin is well organized, being driver oriented with most features that I wanted being standard. The car is also very quiet with a supple ride for a sports car, paired with a responsive steering system.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The absence of torque steer that ruins most powerful FWD cars, the Audi looks with the high quality interior, and the red stripe on the front with the red brake calipers behind the 18' wheels. I also like the simple but functional dash. The FSI paired with the turbo also seems to be perfect.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only owned my GTI for three days now but I am really enjoying it.

I first thought what am I doing dropping this much money on a 2-door hatchback but after driving it more and feeling the performance this little thing has it is worth it. If you are thinking of looking at one drive it before you look at the sticker price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My first two cars were purchases that I could afford. This car was a "desire" and a nice treat to myself. It has fantastic pickup, a great transmission, and a beautiful VW interior. It gets good gas mileage for a sporty car. It handles very nicely. The sport suspension took some time to get used to after driving two floaty cars prior to this one. The hatchback is very practical, despite American's typical disdain of them. My mother has owned 11 VWs with very few reliability problems and they are extremely safe. My brother was in a head on collision in a '98 Jetta going 65 mph. He literally walked away with no injuries. This alone is a reason to buy VW.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After I test drove it, I canceled my other test drives and bought the GTI. Mine is actually a 2006.5, but it has the same features as the 2007 model. I love almost everything about it, especially its power. I opted for the manual transmission because I like the feel of shifting myself. the clutch and shifter are very smooth. The interior design seems well thought out, and has lots of nice little extra features I never got in my American cars. It is relatively quiet for a little car. It has really brought back the pleasure of driving for me, which I thought I had lost.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The power and responsiveness. The hatchback is very handy. I appreciate the built-in compass and trip computer features. It gets respectable gas mileage for a performance car. I got 29 mpg on two long road trips driving 80-85 mph.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was a salesman at a Chevy dealership. I was looking for a fun-to-drive rig with aftermarket potential. I test drove many cars (Tiburon, Civic Si, Cobalt SS, Scion tC), but fell in lust with the ease of control, drivability, and the "oomph factor" that's found in turbocharged cars. This car may look like the Rabbit, with the exception of the sinister red grin on the grill, but underneath the cute exterior lies the quick-revving, adrenaline pumping, heart of an import-killing beast. The GTI is heavier than before (almost twice the weight of the A1 body), but with a power-to-weight ratio that puts many more expensive rigs to shame. Plus the car has almost no turbo lag. VW rocks! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Sport setting on the shift is great for off-the-line launching, but the most rockin' feature has to be the DSG paddles on the wheel. Tap up and 8 milliseconds later, you're in the next gear. It makes a stick shift seem weak.</FAVORITE>

The quality inside and out, the safety (me), and the performance (him) won us over. I have owned German performance cars and this GTI has many of those factors. The DSG transmission is a major advancement in performance and to be in a car at this price point is hard to believe.

It is fun to drive. I added a new suspension and a chip. They make it handle and go even better. This car might cost a little bit more compared to Honda, Mini, others, but you have to pay for all the same extras that comes with the GTI.
