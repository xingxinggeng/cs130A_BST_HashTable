<TEXT>Still own a 1996 Tacoma 4x4 with 308,000 miles and is an excellent truck. Needed better mpg, and since Corolla has been in the Toyota lineup for 40 yrs, I decided that would work for me. I haven't been disappointed at all. Low maintenance (doesn't even require auto tranny fluid changes!). No mechanical problems in 40,000 so far.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fun to drive. Excellent mileage (as high as 41 mpg in low elevations, 46 in high elevations of Colorado). Legendary Toyota quality and value. No American car can match it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have owned Toyota's for quite a long time. Love them! I do a 40 mile commute to work and it is really good on gas. Just have one problem. The rims look rusty! My dad's 87 Toyota pickup has better looking rims them mine. Don't know. Bought it brand new with 11 miles on it. Paying a lot of money and the rims shouldn't look like that!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very roomy interior, and trunk space to be a small car!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Toyota 2 years ago brand new from the dealership with 0 miles and I love it! This car is so cute and roomy on the inside! It drives great the AC is freezing cold and I really like the interior design. I got a special package of the CE that included cruise control, power windows and locks and something else but I forgot what it is... lol... I love my car, I just wish it didn't have those black things on the side of the door.. I have a cute White one and the black things annoy me, I'm trying to find out if I can get them replaced for white ones to match my exterior paint, but have been unsuccessful.. I love this car though! Awesome car!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This a great economy car. I consistently get around 30 mpg on 50/50 highway city drive. The reliability has been excellent so far. The ride is where this vehicle is lacking a lot. Maybe the goal was to make the car with stiff suspension to look and handle more sporty. The result is rough ride with clearly pronounced and annoying bumps - "haystack wagon" as somebody else called it. My other car is Huyndai Elantra and believe me the difference in ride quality is huge.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the 07 CE model early this year. I commute 60 miles a day and needed something with good gas mileage. I love the plain Jane exterior, it just seems to blend in seamlessly. The interior looks nice with the two tone gray, and the cloth seats look better than average. The stereo sounds great, and the controls are super user friendly. The air is cold and the heat is hot, which is always a plus. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The user friendliness of this car, the trunk space is awesome, the amount of head room is nice for the taller crowd, easy parking, and the little compartments are great for things you need to have in reach.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My parents bought this car used when it was a year old and had about 25k on it (bought from a rental car company). It has served us great. The 1.8L has plenty of pickup to really move the car, but still gets phenomenal mileage (30 mpg in mostly city driving). It has been bulletproof thus far, and that will probably not change. I love the size of the trunk (and folding rear seats). The seats are comfortable and easily accommodate all drivers, both large and small. I highly recommend to anybody that needs a trustworthy economical car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first Toyota I have owned and it is an amazing car. My last 3 cars have been Pontiacs and this is by far the best. After reading reviews I was a little hesitant to purchase a Corolla, I'm 6'4" and 230 lbs. I fit in the car just fine. The drivers seat is comfortable and I have no problems reaching the steering wheel, although I do understand a need for a telescopic steering wheel. The car rides and drives great. I hope to get 250,000 miles out of it, or until the wheels fall off. Whatever comes first. I just sold a Firebird and the Corolla puts the bird to shame as far as handling and drive-ability. Go get one today, don't wait. The gas mileage is great too, highway/city.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought this car one month ago. I love it. 40 mpg overall avg with 25%city/75% hwy after 2000 miles. Handles well and acceleration with the 5 speed is great. The drivers seat takes some getting used to, not the most comfortable. I am 5'll'' and 195lbs and the seat and front leg room are only adequate for my size. I would not recommend this car to anyone above 6'2'' or 220lbs. The build quality is typically Toyota solid. My backup car is a 93 Corolla that has 222,000miles on it and still runs great, so I am hoping the reliability will be the same with the 07. Overall, its a well built car with excellent resale value, is great on gas, and has a history of bulletproof reliability.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Excellent gas mileage even at 80mph on the hwy. Indigo ink is a very sharp color. Stock CD system. Reliability. 5-spd shifter.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Positives: Classic and classy exterior. Quiet and comfortable interior. This car is peppy on the start, smooth on the braking. Excellent fit and finish. Turns corners very easily and quickly. Excellent gas mileage. Short enough to parallel park in city. Negatives: cheap plastic storage slots under radio waste space; drink holders awkward to use, spill onto seats, should be under radio; radio control too complex, too many FM buttons; rear headrests block driver's view; antenna easy to steal, should power retract; needs flat surface for food/small objects in lieu of bulky container under armrest; driver-side piller creates blind spot. For $15,363 a very good value.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just bought the car yesterday, drove 150 miles, like the car alot. * Handles nicely at 75 mph. It handles ok at 80 mph (if highway is very smooth but not if bumpy). * Power to accelerate is above avg., (feels better than Sentra that we didn't buy). * Visibility is very good looking over dash, back and side mirrors provide great view. * Seats are very comfortable and adjust nicely for my 5'2" or 6' husband. Legroom very good. Seatbelt is very comfortable. * Car is fairly quiet at lower speed but gets more road noise at higher highway speed. Sound system is nice up to about 70 mph, it is not enjoyable to play at 75-80 mph. * Looking forward to great mileage and reliability,,, Jackie</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Antilock breaks, 6 air bags, felt these safety features is a real selling point. Like that it comes with anti theft features and alarm system like more expensive cars. Trunk inside release is a very good feature. Lights on mirro illuminate inside nicely while not interfering </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car the same week the 2007 was available. It drives well, better than a Yaris. Its cheaper than a HONDA civic, its cheaper than the ALTIMA. Think about it this way, if you are in the market to buy a car that you need to use for your family and for traveling to work back and forth this thing is AMAZING! acceleration is good, fuel economy is great, if i had to give this car a grade on a scale of 1 - 10, it would be a 9.8 for sure. </TEXT>

First full tank of gas produced 32MPG which is great- Speaker system (6 speakers) is incredible. Great price- Great value</TEXT>

<TEXT>Quite a good little performer. I find that the 1.8L 4 cyl engine outdoes the 2.4L of the competition that I drove. This car is not a dud at all. It can cruise down the highway smooth and quiet at 70mph or more. The LE has all the equipment you ever need. 30mpg around town is common. 40mpg or close to it at highway speeds. I hauled 4 adults, one of them over 300 lbs, from the airport without crowding or noticeable loss of power due to being heavily loaded. I like this car more every day and am happy it was my choice over competition. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like all the equipment that came on the LE. Power windows & door locks, cruise control, radio with CD player, all of the handy storage compartments, the interior trunk & gas cap release,rear window defroster, the nice cruise control and the pump up adjustable drivers seat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I picked up my 2007 Corolla S about 2 weeks ago, and my husband and I are Toyota converts! We love it. We especially enjoy thumbing our noses at the big oil companies! I find it very fun to drive, and I am a sports-car person. I've even gotten double takes from Lexus drivers because it looks hot! We are looking forward to purchasing a brand new Camry in about 3 years to replace my husband's gas-guzzling F-150. This Corolla replaced another gas-guzzler, my Jeep Liberty. I love the look and quality of this vehicle. There's not a squeak or rattle to be heard. I LOVE IT!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drove my Corolla for a year with the impression that it had a big-car feel and a very smooth feel (smoothest ever in fact). Then something broke, and the dealership has been unable to fix it. Now I do not feel safe driving on the interstate because if I hit even a small bump (and especially a series of small bumps) it feels like I am going to loose control. At slower speeds, it is just uncomfortable to drive on anything but the smoothest of roads. The dealership claimed to replace the front struts, and maybe they did because it did seem to reduce the rough feel for a 1-2 days.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I got a great deal on this little car more than a year ago and wanted to write a review. It's been a great for in town and it drives well on longer trips. Our two children fit easily in the back seat and the trunk has plenty of room for short trips. We have a manual and our average gas mileage is 32 mpg in town and 38 mpg on the hwy. I think it is the best bang for the buck when compared to other manufactures. My experience has been great with all Toyota products. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this car for my daily commute (about 55kms one way). I bought the SE (special edition) so it came with a sunroof. I was a little annoyed it didn't come with cruise control. The car has plenty of pickup for merging onto the highway and bombing around the city. Gas mileage was a little less than promised but still good. I would agree that the steering wheel position is difficult for taller drivers. It can be difficult to grab the steering wheel while finding a comfortable location for you legs. Plenty of space for a commuter car and lots of trunk room. Almost two years later no mechanical issues and the price was right.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We purchased this car as a downsize from an SUV because of gas mileage and gas prices. The Corolla has great gas mileage, we average between 32 and 35. Handles well and looks good. It is so small though. The door pockets are not large enough to put much in. There needs to be a trunk release on the keypad. It would also be nice if the direction and temperature indicator was on the rearview mirror instead of the dash. The front drivers seat can be raised... it would be nice if the passenger seat raised as well. The map lights on the rearview mirror are nice. The passenger can have it on tp read a map or whatever without it disturbing the driver. </TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second car - I bought a new one in Nov 2006 (my first car was an old Mitsubishi Galant, which I drove from 60K to 100K miles). Actual mileage (city + some freeway) = 25 mpg. The battery went dead at 6K miles, after I didn't drive for 2 weeks. The car has a good ground clearance, but when I drive on a windy freeway, it feels like the car is going to be blown away. Not enough power entering a short or ascending freeway on-ramp.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a brand new 2007 model in Nov 2006 paying a high premium. In a year, I have come across these problems: (1) One day, the computer broke (went out of order) by itself and the car totally stopped. I had to get it towed to the dealer who fixed the necessary hardware & codes taking 3-4 days. But if this would have happened during one of my journeys to Canada, what would have been my fate? (2) The driver and front passenger seats are horribly uncomfortable. We feel as if we are sitting on a wooden bench without any cushion. In a drive of 30 minutes, you would like to get off the seat because of the pain it gives. Also, arm-rests are not provided. I am not at all happy with Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Driving by myself it has plenty of pick up to get thru traffic. Load it down with wife, kids and luggage and it tends to slow it down to a craw. Great gas mileage (32 mpg adv). Great interior and exterior design. The radio isn't too good and the seats are not so soft. I need to take it to the dealership to because of the dashboard vibrates pretty loud. But with that said, if you are looking for a basic dependable car that gets great gas mileage, the Corolla is hard to beat for the price.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Unquestionably the most practical, reliable, efficient gasoline passenger automobile with best resale period. The LE version has everything you need and nothing you don't. Street priced around $3K below sticker, a name brand and very plentiful, it has no meaningful competitor for basic, safe and reliable transportation with lowest total cost of ownership.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Near hybrid mileage without being a hybrid (hybrids are not available with manual transmission). Teriffic visibility makes driving and parking in tight spaces fun. Oil and filter changes are also very easy. Toyota also provides better quality OEM Goodyear tires than expected an entry level car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Great overall car. Outside it looks very good. Not too sporty. Inside is very solid and has higher quality looking materals around the dash and steering wheel. Toyota plays it safe and didn't try too hard on its design inside and out. I own the blue one. All of the paint jobs are very nice. It drives and handles great unless you are in hilly country. Then it needs some extra pep. The seats have a nice adjustable recline that is very comfortable but could be a little softer. In fact, the seats are very hard and don't break in. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Being retired, we tried getting along with one car for a year but, living in a rural area, it just didn't work. After much research, we decided on the Corolla CE as best suited for our second car needs. Now after 9 months of of trouble free ownership, it's rapidly taking primary car status away from our '05 Pacifica. The little car is pleasing to drive and feels bigger than it is. Our fuel mileage is consistenly higher than that posted on the window sticker. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We bought this car in January so we could have a nice little economy car to drive around. I had a lot of driving to do over the summer and our other vehicle is a Dodge Ram Quad Cab. It is one of my most favorite cars I have ever driven. It has surprised me more than once with its handling and efficiency. A great car if you do a lot of driving and spend many hours in your car. I like the manual shift, I get greater control and that is something this car in an automatic model would not produce on its own. The standard shift also gives me more MPG on the highway and in the city. I average about 38 mpg to 42 mpg on the highway. It has 15000 miles on it now, so as you can see, I love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Nice cheap little car. Lacks performance with a 126 HP engine, especially with 3 passengers on board and the AC cranking, the thing will barely accelerate under all that stress. At higher speeds, at about above 75 mph, it becomes a little unstable to drive on the highway, it feels like you could lose control of it because of the wind and drag. I think the car might be too light. I also don't get the advertised mileage. But on the upside, it still runs. I guess that is all that is asked for by any Corolla owners and nothing more.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I drive the S, so it has a sportier look, but nothing sportier under the hood. I don't like that this model is larger than previous generations. At times my compact parks like a small bus. OK gas mileage, though I admit my mileage is 90% city (averaging around 27-30 mpg, 34-37 when I do drive highway).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the extras: sunroof, alloy wheels, ground kit. Where I live, foglights are useless, so I could have done w/o, but they add to the look of the sport model.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car 10 months ago and it still feels like a new car. Being a new car it is hard to say how reliable it is but it has not failed me yet. The gas is wonderful and lasts a long time though like any other car the A/C drains the gas very fast. I will say that this is not a sports car. Don?t expect to go 0-60 in 2 seconds. It is mainly for looks not speed. I use it just to take me to work and really nothing more. I highly recommend this car if you want a low price car and great gas mileage. Just wish the A/C was stronger.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Today, I have owned my new 07 Corolla LE exactly 3 months. I have over 11K miles on it, 80/20 highway/city at around 73-75 mph, highway. I drive with a light touch and I am getting 34.9 mpg. I anticipated closer to 38. We got this car for economy and reliability. I think the mpg will improve as the car wears in. Handling is ok, acceleration is ok and road noise is ok. It?s an econo-box, not a sports car. We are happy with the car, it has met our expectations. I like the traditional body style. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Initially, I loved the car. Into 1-2 months, the car was taken in for various concerns, mostly brakes, then later in the months for check engine light, rattling. The dealership supposedly resolved the issues. Why was it necessary to go back on many occasions, especially for the brake work? And why did the check engine light come on (this was not filling up the gas tank related)? I am now questioning the reliability of the car. All I want is a good car, with good gas mileage, and looks good.</TEXT>

I don't really get excited when I'm in it and I don't look at it beautifully like I did my previous car.

<TEXT>Have owned an 01 Avalon, 02 Camry, and 06 Avalon w/ highest regard for my purchases and vehicle performances. Purchased 07 Corolla 3 weeks ago. The Corolla fits into the same value and performance as those Toyos of previous. Clearly not a sports car. Clearly not the most vivacious exterior. Clearly not my 06 Avalon. However, this vehicle matches my travel needs extremely well. My auto tran is delivering 36 mpg with a quiet and smooth ride. I drive 700 miles per week for business, and this vehicle exceeds expectations for travel and value.

<TEXT>I'm pleasantly surprised at the excellent performance, handling and relative quietness of the Corolla. I came to this car after running a 1990 Ford Probe 5 speed GL into the ground. The Probe would easily beat the Corolla off the line but highway performance and handing on curvy roads are the same. Corolla stick shifting is smoother. Tire noise is quieter than Probe but still noticeable. Engine is quieter and smoother. Fuel economy is currently running 37 mpg highway and suburban driving. Over the first winter 34 mpg was typical. I only hope Corolla reliability lives up to the reputation. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Well if you get down to it, the Corolla is the highest purchased vehicle in the world due to popular demand. 42 MPG, affordable, dependable, sporty, and talk about resale. I drive a Tahoe that I love and we needed a vehicle for my wife and looking at reviews on this car it is the highest rated and most purchased. There are a lot of other vehicles out there cheaper, but when I buy a vehicle I would like it to hold its value so when I trade it in I can get what it's worth.

<TEXT>I drive 400 miles a week and needed a car that was more economical with these increasing gas rates, I was spending over $450 a month on gas alone. It was time for a change even if it ended with a small payment for some time. The first thing I did was an internet search - autos with high gas mileage, 35 miles per gallon and cheap. Guess what popped up on every web site and forum, Yes Corolla. So my only option at this point was to buy one. Yes, now I made the correct choice. I used to fill my tank 3 times a week. Now I only need to fill up once a week. That is a money saver. Thank you Toyota for making my life more reliable and practical.</TEXT>

Roomy trunk. Outstanding economy, 30-35 mpg. Driving postition is a bit odd when hands are at 10 and 2 on wheel. It's fine for the 4 and 8 o'clock position the pros recommend. Only gripe is that useful options e.g. alloys, stability, abs, hard to find. Distributors prefer packing the car with pricey junk like paint sealant, stripes, etc.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Corolla has moved into the sweet spot in the American car scene that the Camry held for years.The car is as big as a 96 Camry inside and will meet most drivers' needs as well. The Camry has become more car than most of us need now. Gas prices have many Americans looking for a new sweetheart. Corolla is much more refined than before. The ride is smooth and quiet and there is plenty of power. The fabrics are even Camrylike, soft yet durable. Everything seems to be right where you would have put it yourself. Just the right car at the right time. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I replaced my 2000 Pontiac Bonneville with a 2007 Toyota Corolla LE 5 spd. The only reason we went with a small car was because of the cost of gas, otherwise we would have never done it. The 2007 Corolla is horribly uncomfortable to drive. There is no support under the front part of your thighs, and the steering wheel is too far away. It seems impossible to adjust the seat to get into a comfortable driving posting where you can actually grab the steering wheel at 10 and 2. My wife owned an '89 Toyota Corolla and it seems like it has changed little since then except gotten more uncomfortable.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Great gas mileage. I drive 45 miles a day and I am getting every bit of the sticker posted gas mileage for the 5 spd (32 - 41). The Toyota also has a good size trunk for a small car, I've got my golf clubs, and a whole bunch of other stuff in there.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I tried not to like this car, but every time I compared it to something American made there was no comparison. The S model makes the car look much nicer in my opinion. I have almost 4000 miles on it since March. Gas mileage is excellent. Consistently getting 34-35 mpg with 75% highway driving. I'm 6'-2" and am pretty comfortable in it. I use a wheelchair and it fits in the trunk fine. The seating position makes you feel like you are sitting in a larger car. I agree with many other reviewers that the steering wheel position is a bit awkward, but I have quickly gotten used to it.

<TEXT>At 6500 miles, we've had a rear trim weather strip/seal fall off. Gas mpg not what sticker called for (31 city/38 hwy) although not bad, we're getting about 34 on the hwy and 27 in the city. Transmission shifts good, although it switches between gears a lot on the hwy, usually downshifting going up hills and mountains. This is probably due to a low torque/horsepower engine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Corolla, like all Toyotas, has been built with precision to be reliable and practical. I got the S model so I could look good at the same time. The car is fairly fun to drive too, thanks to a smooth and peppey engine and a precise 5 spd manual. I was looking at a Mazda 3, which I still think is more fun and better looking, but the price was right on the Toyota (probably because they're revamping this model for 2008)with 0.9% interest and $750 cash back on a lease. It's built for smaller drivers (I'm 6') as evidenced by the steering wheel being close to the dash and high seat height. After about a week I found an acceptable driving position, but still no thigh support.</TEXT>

The Probe had an edge in acceleration during passing but the Corolla is noticeable quieter at 75mph. Tire noise is about the same. Corolla shifting is clearly smoother. Calculated fuel economy averages 33 mpg. On Boston to NYC trips I've gotten 40. Trunk space is surprisingly roomy. A key factor was that it carry all my amateur astronomy stuff.

<TEXT>I have owned my toyota for about a month I traded in a 4x4 ford F150 with a huge V8 for this little nimble toyota corolla I was getting about 17 miles to the gallon in the truck I drive from Ohio to Alabama every other weekend and the Truck was killing me in gas. I bought the toyota corolla to help ease the pain of my pocket book in fuel cost. I have about 2500 miles on my toyota now and I am a bit disapointed in the fuel economy I have gotten only 33 miles to the gallon on the highway and as little as 24 miles to the gallon in the city very unhappy with that wondered if I should have just kept the big gas hog fo the difference in the milage I thought I would get. Overall I like the car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've only put a thousand miles on my Corolla. Been keeping careful track of my mileage. While the car is hardly broken in yet (1100 actual miles) I have never gotten more than 24.9 mpg. This is generally city mileage. I was expecting better, but maybe as the car loosens up it will improve. The steering wheel is a bit far, as others have mentioned and the the driver's seat a bit short. I am replacing my old Honda Accord Wagon with this car, and expected less space but I was pleasantly surprised about having a better view as the Corolla is a taller car than the Accord. Some minor quality problems, a tiny warp in the windshield, but the car will hopefully be a reliable appliance.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am a parent of two teenage daughters and I feel that small cars should be safe also. The car drives well and the steering is crisp enough to add security on mountain roads. The ride is fair on confort and leg room is just enough for 5'-10" people. The Toyota Corolla is a great little car, but the base model is hard to find with air bags. We finally found one with the side curtain and side seat air bags without the top end LE accessories. Consumer Reports recommended buying the Toyota Corolla, but only with the air bag option. It is not something I hope to test, but it is reassurring to know they will save a life when needed. The brakes stop the car with enough safety as well.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The air bags of course, but the radio/CD player is nice as well. Pressing the TEXT button is a nice option when the car is parked and you have time to read all the information.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is an impressive car in all respects. Exterior design is very attractive with the S package but I prefer it without the spoiler. Build quality is outstanding. Love the ride and handling and fuel mileage seems to meet spec--I've had my car for a week. It's quieter on the road than I thought it would be. Seats are comfortable but I have to agree with some other reviewers that the driver cushion is a little short ( and I have short legs).I also agree with others who complain about needing a telescoping wheel. Horsepower is adequate. Amazing trunk size for a compact. I recently drove a Caliber and it cannot match the Corolla in any category. I'm glad I bought my Corolla.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first new car ever, my previous car was a Nissan Maxima handed down from my mother. I really wanted something reliable and fuss free and I think I got exactly that with the Corrolla. The drive is pretty smooth and easy although pick-up on the highway is above average not as powerful as perhaps other cars in the same class. The interior is nice and plush and I like the extra detailing of the wood accents that come with the LE model. There are some minus points however, the buttons for the audio system are set too far away from the driver, especially if you have shorter arms, no controls on the steering wheel like Honda Civic. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Auto tire pressure check, overdrive feature for highway vs city driving, fuel economy, safety with upgraded MR package and plush seats. Also really like the car design shape, I'm not into these spaceship pod looks that are in lately.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my third Toyota having owned Corollas since 1990. Previous 2 were LE models. The Sport- with Sunroof and ground effects is by far teh best yet! People comment on the beautiful exterior- especially the "indigo blue" color. I invent places to go just to drive!</TEXT>

<TEXT>At first, I was hesitant to buy such a compact car since I have driven nothing but SUV's. I sold my 2003 Suburbam about a month ago because of gas prices but when my brother told me about the Corolla I paid attention. I was looking for economical car anyways and went to test drive it. I was hooked as soon as I drove it.It rides smoothly, it has power and it is fun to drive. The features I got for the price, automatic transmission, power mirrors, CD, outside temperture and AC all for the outrageous price of $11,998.00 is a heck of a deal.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>CD and AC</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got a 2007 Corolla and the paint and bodywork are not good. Poor design of Rear bumper and generally poor quality paint job. Been back to dealer once for paint work and still not good. Otherwise seems to run okay, good MPG but a bit too much engine noise.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I'm 65 years old and this Corolla just makes me like it more each time I drive it. In the city it runs around like a peppy little rabbit and on the highway it handles 75 mph speed limits like you are going 50. Fully loaded with 3 big adults and luggage and coolers (the trunk is larger than you think) cruising at 75 mph our gas mileage was 37 & 38 mpg. Less money and better equipped than all the other vehicles I tested. In a few years I may give this car to my grandson and then I may try a Camry. Anyway, buy one and start to enjoy it right now. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Gas mileage & performance are great from this peppy 1.8L 4 cylinder. Quality of workmanship throughout the vehicle is vvery high standard.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It looks great, bought the white S. Interior room is good. Have 2 young children and they do good in the back seat. My first mileage was 41.6 mpg with the automatic driving very easy on the highway in break-in. Except when the Escaldes try to run up your tail pipe at 65 mph. I drive 100 miles per day so will enjoy the MPG. Some people complained about the steering wheel being too far away, however it suits me fine as I drag my knuckles when I walk anyway. This is my 2nd Toyota, my first was 83 pickup which I got over 250,000 miles on b4 I sold it after 15 years. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Easy to change oil, filter front passenger side. My old car 87 Honda Prelude you had to take the airbox off to get to it. Love the huge trunk for a small car.</FAVORITE>
