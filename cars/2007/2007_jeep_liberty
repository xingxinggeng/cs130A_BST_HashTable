<TEXT>I love my 2007 Liberty, hate to let it go, but the factory warranty expires in Nov and I'm not impressed with the overall quality of the vehicle and will be trading it in this month. I've replaced five window regulators, and that's a lot of time sitting at dealerships, waiting for it to be fixed. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The steering is very hard and am not crazy about the tire on the back. The heat controls take a while before going to the selected temperature. Not the best gas mileage either. I paid for built in blou tooth and when I received the vehicle it was installed and not built in. I am still very disappointed with that. I'm not sure that this vehicle is a good value for the money I paid. I've had it since Sept 2007 and All in all to date its an ok vehicle. </TEXT>

<TEXT>If you want a small SUV that has great off-road capability and still provides a decent city and highway ride, this is it. I think the folks that have complained about Chrysler standing behind their vehicle should probably look at their dealership. I have had exceptional warranty service.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Well, we now have had problems with a window regulator. Luckily, the dealership replaced one with the new updated model that corrects the defect. Although the dealership would not use the word defective. Our mileage continues to be great after the syn lubes, PI in the tank, Costco Michelin tires with nitrogen. 25 mpg not too bad for 4x4. We cannot thank our Master mechanic enough for recreating our Jeep with great parts like Bosch Platinum+4 100,000 mile spark plugs and Amsoil synthetic lubes. We change oil only once a year now, we like that. And under the Magnuson-Moss act of 1974 syn. extended oil changes cannot void warranties. If the dealership says otherwise they are lying.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling is superb! By throwing crap Chrysler parts and petroleum oils and using good ones the mileage is much better from 16 to 25mpg, and a lot of extra power. Much more fun to drive. Quick, nimble and a real keeper.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Obviously the Jeep is geared for power not for mileage so any aftermarket improvements you can make will help the mileage. Never use Goodyear tires as their rolling resistance is horrible. 20% of the Jeeps energy is wasted just on tire rolling resistance. We use Michelin tires and that helps greatly. A friend uses synthetic lubes throughout and a cold air intake by K&N. The new Liberties are way to boxy and just don't seem to have the heart of the earlier Liberties... Others may disagree but that is my take. With some aftermarket improved parts you will have a better performing vehicle with better gas mileage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a follow up review (2 years old 30k miles). Overall we still enjoy the Liberty. It is an average small SUV but the american manufacturing is definitely show through. Still under warranty so all window regulators have been replaced at least once, some twice. Seats are very uncomfortable on long road trips (very little lumbar support). MPG is actually pretty decent for a V6 3.7L on road trips, city MPG is horrible (16 city 25 highway). Decent amount of cargo with seats folded down. We have enjoyed it so far but won't buy another. This is our first American car and we have decided to stick with foreign. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Peppy V6, rear windows roll down 100% (unless broken), cargo space, turns on a dime, handling is great, satellite radio, auto locking doors and grocery hooks (my wife lets things roll around like crazy in the back)</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've recently purchased a used 2007 Jeep Liberty Sport and have enjoyed the driving experience. This Jeep offers a solid ride with great sight lines - almost no blind spots. The Jeep handles any road conditions - I live in a snow belt area and the smooth shift-on-the-fly 4X4 feature makes for confident and safe driving on the worst of roads. This vehicle handles well in both highway and city driving. It offers tons of space inside but is easy to park on a downtown street. The sound system is good, all dash board controls are within convenient reach, and the center located window controls are a neat idea. The back tailgate/window set up is unique and works like a charm! This Jeep is a keeper!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Smooth shifting 4X4 transfer, back tailgate swings wide and back window automatically opens up and out the way, dashboard controls are well designed, easy to reach, fans throw lots of heat on those cold winter days, solid ride, responsive steering, this Jeep grips the road in every condition! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I like this liberty, it's my first. I've owned cherokees, grand cherokees, wranglers and good 'ol cj's. Every one did what I expected and nothing I didn't. Some of these reviews whine about fuel mileage or ride comfort, if you want 50 mpg and a soft ride.... Buy a prius! Of course you'll get stuck on wet Grass and wreck it in a 2 inch deep road rut! I bought a Jeep to use like a Jeep! The liberty gets acceptable mileage considering the gearing / suspension / aerodynamics of the vehicle and the ride is good for something that has the off road abilities it does! Fine auto/ deserves the Jeep name !</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had my liberty for a year and a half and absolutely loved it, minus a few problems with the windows. However, I recently ran off the road, hit a culvert, took a nose dive, and then flipped. My airbags did not go off, even thought I took a nose dive. Also, my seat belt never locked. The car did holdup well and all 4 doors still opened easily, even though I ended up up side down. But the seat belt should have at least locked, this was very dangerous.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I too have had problems with my electric windows. Have had the car exactly 1 year now three of my windows have broke on me. Ridiculous that so many of us have repeatedly experienced the same problem, but no fix actions have been taken. Have heard many negative reviews about Chrysler products and this is making me think twice about purchasing another one. Several of the fitting for the outside plastic trim were also broken and the trim loose when sold to me. Again, quality control really needs to be addressed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My 07 Liberty is a great vehicle. Window regulator broke too, but they fixed it. I've had the car since Oct 07 and have 23,000 miles. Took it in for NYS insp. and found I needed new pads and rotors. Mechanic said it shouldn't have done that.I'm pretty easy on the brakes and that isn't a lot of miles. Cost me over $300 for just the front brakes. Chrysler should be ashamed for making inferior parts for such a nice vehicle. Talked to several mechanics and they all said the brakes on the Liberty are really bad. I am disappointed in that. The gas mileage isn't that great either. Agree that the window controls shouldn't be in center console.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this car new. Since February 2007 the window regulators (parts that Hold up the windows) have been repaired 5 times. Many people have this problem with Jeeps--years 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and waiting to see if 2008 does too. Contacted Chrysler and they told me they had no info about a permanent fix. Not helpful at all. The car is a lemon! Also stain resistant seats are not stain resistant. Many owners spill water on seat (like me) and water leaves a brown stain on the stain resistant seats. What a joke.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We too noticed right off the bat that the gas mileage was horrible: about 16 mpg average: we took our jeep to a great mechanic who laughed and said you need to understand that Chrysler uses crap parts: he started by lubing with amsoil synthetic, threw away crap spark plugs and installed Bosch Platinum +4's, nitrogen in the tires and now we average 25 mpg which is a great improvement. Dealership wanted $500.00 + to change spark plugs every 30k said would take 1 1/2 hour, they lied: mechanic showed me how easy it was, took 20 minutes and Bosch plugs are 100k mile plugs. Don't trust dealerships they steal your money.</TEXT>

<TEXT>It's fun to drive, it hauls lots of stuff in the back, the seats aren't comfy at all and hard for a short person to adjust. The gas mileage should be better for the size, but I love the 6 cyl power. Why did my windows break at only 1 yr/6000mi and the dealer tells me "they always do that in Libertys" and Jeep has chosen to NOT address the issues? I will not buy another Jeep. The dealership told me we will continue to have to replace the widow assembly, because they always break. Now my dash is buckling. The dealer says it's because we live in the desert. Then why isn't it happening to our 2 other cars that are older?</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought my Liberty Sept. 07 and have been in love with it ever since. Previously I had a Ford Focus which I disliked and wanted something bigger and better in the snow since I live in PA. It drives great in the snow and on anything you throw its way. Quick on the highway. Approx. 20 mpg which isn't awful but it would be nice if it was better. I'm not sure why people complain about the window controls. I had a Mercedes and they were in the same place. I like them there since the driver and passenger can control them. Comfortable driver seat. So much fun to drive. I'll never own anything other than a Jeep. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Liberty is really fun to drive. Quick and drives well in any type of weather. Neat spot for cup holders and window controls in the back seat. Roomy cargo area. Just big enough to be a comfortable SUV but not too overpowering. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my jeep Liberty for almost a year. It's very quick on the highway. I drive from Burlington to Asheville twice a week and I love the way it handles on the drive up to the mountains. I get about 19-20 mph and it's ok since gas is $4.00 per gallon. I do have a problem with the electric windows and had to fix the drivers side window twice. It needed to be replaced. My back passenger window has also broke. They seem to not close properly and are not easily fixed. I checked for a recall but none yet. Overall I love my suv.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the fact that it's a suv and can be used to haul things. It's not big and bulky. I like the interior and the back seat. The cup holders are in the right place. The seat covers are made of a good fabric.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Generally, I love my jeep. It's my 3rd, having had a 1991 Cherokee and a 1995 Grand Cherokee. I was initially sold only because of the warranty and features (the previous 2 had a lot of problems). Now, I'm really happy with it. It rides well off roads, is amazing in snow and mud, and drives reasonably on the road. It's been reliable, even compared to more "reliable" cars a few of my friends purchased at about the same time. The gas mileage seems to be about the same as my 5.2L V8 Grand Cherokee while being a good bit smaller. Also, the ground clearance is limited compared to my previous jeeps. which are my only complaints. Some complain about window controls, but I've had BMW's-same place :)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Generally, it a reliable machine that handles well when you want an SUV to act live an SUV - in the snow and off road. The best deal in the price range with the best warranty and the only one with luxury features like heated seats and leather</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my Jeep in Jan 07, and wanted to drive it for awhile before reviewing it. So far I am very happy with it. I live in the snow belt and drive a lot for work, it handled the snow with no problems. I always felt like it was holding the road and it went through anything I asked it to.I have no idea why the window controls are in the middle, and wish the cup holders & shifter were reversed but not a big deal. I looked @ Toyota, Honda, & Chevy but think I made the best choice for the money. My husband bought a Ranger but now wants my Jeep, we race for the keys. Over all I can't find anything I really don't like, & my next one will be the new model with the huge sunroof. Great little SUV.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the small dash, gives a better view of the road. Quick little V6 that moves through traffic. Easy to maneuver & parks anyplace. Turns on a dime. Very comfortable to drive, will be nice on trip this summer. With gas @ $4 gas mileage a big plus I wanted an SUV so expected to do worse. Love the key.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased my Liberty 6 months ago, and even though I love driving it, I'm thinking of trading it in. With the soaring gas prices, and the way this SUV loves to drink it, it is costing me a lot of money in gas. It is very cute and I love the way it handles. There is plenty of room for the kids in the back, and I like the way that the back door opens. As I read in other reviews, the glove box is small...there is however, a slot over it that holds the owners manual. I don't like where the window controls are located and they would be better on the doors. To sum it up, however, it is a cute, fun to drive vehicle that has a lot of pep. I would recommend it if you can afford the gas.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Overall nice SUV. Perfect for a little family looking for something safe. Ours has over 15k and we have not had any problems. The ac seems to struggle in the hot desert summer as well the windows do seem to struggle at times. We love the power and the versatility of the Liberty. The gas mileage isn't the best but what can you expect from a V6 SUV? It gets about the same as my 2000 Nissan Maxima (AVG 20) I wasn't fond of the body style but my wife loved it and it is growing on me. For the price you can't go wrong. It's our first Jeep so we'll see if we can run it for 10 years like I know they are capable of. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the satellite radio. The peppy V6 engine. The space and cargo area. The outlet in the cargo area. Ability to run the AC adapter with the engine turned off (charge batteries and other things). Compact dash, a mix between the Cherokee and Wrangler.</FAVORITE>

It is fun to drive, comfortable, quick and cute! I wanted a manual and had to search high and low to get it but I did. the gas mileage is very good highway, not so great in the city though. My only complaint is that there is rust on the rims and the car is still only 5 months old. The dealership says they will paint it, so right now I am battling them to have them completely replaced.

<TEXT>We purchased this vehicle as a replacement for a 2003 Hyundai Elantra. With a new baby we needed more room. The 2007 Jeep Liberty Limited is not the vehicle for a growing family. The owner's manual doesn't even fit in the glovebox (there's no storage). The trunk is very tiny. I thought I could live with the back hinge door, but its annoying and heavy. We have had a lot of problems with the front windows not rolling up properly and have taken it to the dealership 3 times, they basically can't fix it. The gas mileage is terrible. I get 18 mpg. The doors don't close properly, you have to slam them shut. It's not comfortable on a long trip. Wish we hadn't bought it!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Liberty for 1 month and it's OK. Gas mileage is OK at 24 mpg. The ride is good, but a little bumpy on rough roads. The seats sit high and give the driver a commanding view, but they can be uncomfortable on longer trips. It does great in the snow, even in 2 wheel. As for convenience features it has a lot to be desired - no storage areas other than the glovebox and a small compartment between the front seats. You have to stretch to reach temperature controls as they sit low on the dash. It's a good vehichle for short trips, but not the best family car to purchase.</TEXT>

It handles great and is great on the trail. I have had no problems with it so far. Overall a great vehicle with excellent build quality and great trail rated capability.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 4x4 system. Interior space in a compact SUV. Excellent build quality. The automatic transmission shifts smoothly.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Looking for a small/mid-size SUV that really is a Sport Utility Vehicle? They're are very few choices left, and the Liberty has always been a front-runner. The right combination of Old-School tried and true Jeep four wheeler know-how, and a good helping of modern safety, capability, and convenience additions. It's not my first Jeep, but it is my favorite so far. I have the 2007 Latitude Edition, and love the combinations of features and pricing. Only thing I miss? Mine doesn't have the overhead trip-computer, oh well. Overall a great vehicle. Styling has held up extremely well since the introduction, and if you don't like the "BOX" trend that Jeep's following, get one now while you can.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Styling, handling, truly exceptional off-road capability right off the showroom floor. A very nice package in at a very attractive price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is our second Jeep Liberty. The "2007" Limited model has all the bells. Again it's fun to drive and can still handle a sizable load. The 200" came with Sirius radio for a year and so far a great addition. It is also equiped with the above center console. Love the temperature and direction indicator. It also has the tire air presure electronic gauge. With the incentives at the time it's hard to pass up against the crowded SUV field.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sirius radio. Electronic tire monitor. Electronic compass and temperature</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In a sea of poor decisions I make a good one. Best thing I've done. Rides great, has power, very nimble and great for any necessary off-roading that may come up. Not to mention I'm saving over a hundred bucks a month. I have a small family and it works for them too. Very stylish interior and the chrome accents really round of the exterior. Jeep had me at honk-honk</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Engine. Styling. Roomier cargo than it lets on. Very responsive handling.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have about 1000 miles on the Liberty. So far most of the driving has been in the city. To date the city driving mpg has been 17. Overall we are very happy with the new jeep. My first jeep and the way things are going it won't be our last. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>We love the fold down rear seat. And it drives like a sports car. It has a firm, but not harsh ride.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've been four wheeling in Chevy pickups since 1967. Well, time for a change, went to a Jeep Liberty 6 speed. It is much easier to drive. Where the Chevy used brute strength - torque and ground clerance to clear obstacles, the Jeep does it by finesse - the coil spring suspension conforms to the terrain providing traction. I love the 6 speed - nice and tight and a good feel. It is very European - snick, snick, snick as I run through the gears. The Liberty is set up for off-road - good articultion and little front or rear overhang. It is not a cross-over car-based SUV like the Honda CRV or Toyota RAV4 - it should not be compared to them in terms of fuel economy and ride.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Six-speed transmission, both on and off road handling, a real two speed transfer case, axle articulation, ground clearance, and minimal overhang. The spare tire is where it should be - out of the way on the tailgate. This helps ground clearnce off the road.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my second Liberty. I traded a 2004 Limited up for a fully loaded 2007 Limited. The incentives were great, and so was the trade. The new car has improved gas mileage, and greater creature comforts than my 2004 model: these include 6-disc CD player, Sirius radio, leather seats, sun roof, on the wheel radio controls. It is comfortable on good roads and on bad roads. Handling is easy. Seems a bit higher off the road than the 2004 model, and the back seats now go down flat so as to open up the rear for more cargo (which for me includes a 75 pound dog). Plenty of space in the cargo area with the seats down. Great car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Handling, comfort, accessories, cargo area, 4WD that gets through the winter snows and poor road maintenance by the municipal and state authorities.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Very fun vehicle. I have the 6 speed manual. The gas mileage isn't too bad if you're on the highway in 6th and running 2WD. With 4WD and driving hard in the snow the gas mileage suffers, but the capabilities of this vehicle in the snow make up for it. 4WD LO range for shows this is a true offroad capable Jeep. Most of the competition is car based. I wish Jeep would keep going in this direction for its new vehicles, but it looks like they're trending towards more carlike lower profile vehicles with the (Dodge/Chrysler) short side windows. Get one while you can. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ground clearance, torquey V6, style, 6 speed manual, 4WD.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Well I think it is a nice vehicle so far. It's just hard to get over the 14.5 mpg it's getting. And thats driving it like a gentle baby. Hate to see how bad it would be if I were heavy footed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>If you need an SUV that can handle rough roads and give you a smooth ride there is no questions this is the best. I test drove every other SUV in this size range and above and kept coming back to the Liberty. I own one and have just ordered a second. It is great on the highway, tight cornering in the city and just tackles the rough roads like nobody's business. I've had my first one through 7, count 'em, 7 hurricanes in Florida. Deep flooded areas. Into the Everglades, down to the beach. Great to drive, no let me correct that FUN to drive. I've got over 120,000 miles and just getting another before they change the body style.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love it so much, I bought a second one and will buy a third because it meets the needs of my family living on a mountain. Handles tight hilly roads even in the sleet & snow. Roomy enough inside for my large frame. Covered expandable cargo area carries stuff from mulch to the larger unexpected garage sale treasure. My wife bought one too. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Small enough to park at a crowded mall, but big enough to take the family camping in the Poconos. And snow on our mountain requires a 4x4 vehicle.</FAVORITE>
