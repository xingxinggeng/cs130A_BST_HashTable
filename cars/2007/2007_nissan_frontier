<TEXT>If you plan to drive your Nissan Nismo off road as it is intended as it is a 4x4 and Nismo is the off road version of the Frontier then before you go off road make sure you go to a 4x4 shop and have thick plastic cut out and put in the area by the back wheel well that sticks out!they have clear plastic there already for that purpose but it is not thick enough nor is it big enough! My Nismo has the rear locker and in 2 years I have never been stuck with the truck yet and this last winter just about wore my 3"x30'tow rope out by pulling everone else out from the record snow that we received! bought new tires and went with the General Grabber AT2 which will get you way more traction!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a very quiet truck, well made, excellent power, rides great, tows a 4000lb travel trailer very well. I recommend it. Nits and picks, turning radius is poor, radio has weird controls, edge of rear tail light not shielded from breakage if tail gate is down. broke it first load of long planks. You lose your traction control if you install aftermarket wheels and tires w/o tire pressure senors.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Love this truck, 21 mpg is a joke unless you are driving Miss Daisy, expect 17-18 at best... Solid build minus the rattle that will never go away??... TIRE SENSOR OR TIRE?? Front tire increases and decreases pressure constantly, dealer can not find problem and the sensor comes on every day?? Very comfortable, roomy, and stylish. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this truck for two years and use it for everything commuting, mountain biking, skiing etc. Lots of power, great on and off road handling, excellent on snow and ice. The crew cab long bed is perfect; I can fit a crew of 4 with 2 dogs and 4 mountain bikes and travel in comfort to far away destinations. I drove all the other crew cab trucks and it came down to the Frontier and the Tacoma, I am very pleased to have chosen the Frontier.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have owned my 2007 Frontier Nismo for a month now (purchased used). Fuel mileage is steady around 18mpg city. I have yet to take it on a trip along highways. It is a bit rougher ride than my neighbors 2006 Frontier XE due to the Nismo package. I would like to have his fuel economy but the towing capacity of mine will be handy with a boat and camper. The ride would be better with different tires. The electronic locking rear differential comes in handy when pulling a boat out of the water at the boat launch. Overall I would give this truck a well deserved A rating.</TEXT>

<TEXT>XE, kingcab, 4 cyl, 4x2, auto, bedliner, cruise, cd, priv/glass, slide-r-wind: excellent truck, tough, sporty and great on gas (23 mph in town). I chose over Ford, Toyota & Chevy. No comparison (quality + value). Daily driver. Big Nissan 4 cyl powers like the competition's 6 cyl! Rear suspension will handle heavy loads without dipping, "try that with an f150!" I've owned Dodge, Ford & Chevy but Nissan sincerely is the best thus far.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I would agree with most of what I have read about this truck, I traded a 2003 ranger 4 liter,4wd, the ranger was 4:10 gears and would outperform the nissan in 1/4 mile, the nissan is quiet, good ride, eye appealing, nice and roomy compared to the ranger, seats take some adjustment to get right, console is short,mileage is about the same as the ranger (less than 20 mpg) I have been a Ford truck guy for years--so far I am pleased with the nissan. I would have liked the cruise controls to light up, se with the value truck package is a good buy in my opinion.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had my Frontier LE for about 3 weeks...not really long enough to review it yet, but i like this truck so much that I couldn't wait! I had a full size 2005 GMC Sierra before this and the Nissan is 10 times more refined in just about every way. I am ALWAYS more impressed by products from Japanese companies, compared to GM products I've owned. Tacoma can't even beat this one. Frontier wins in power, ride, handling, refinement, etc.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just purchased another Nissan truck and I must say the Frontier is a heck of a truck. Have a '95 Nissan truck already and it has more than 356,000 miles with no mechanical issues. It doesn't look like it is going to ever wear out. Wanted to update to something newer and got a great deal. Everything works perfectly and I really like the brawny appearance. I expect this one to last me 15 years or more.</TEXT>

<TEXT>My Frontier offers me all that I want in a truck. It has a box large enough to handle my hauling needs, a powerful engine to get me up the hill I live on, and 4WD for upstate New York winters. I bought a Nissan for the reliability (over Chevy). </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 4WD is awesome. I like the ability to turn off 4WD, and that is what my Nissan gives me. For a truck, road handling is excellent. Comfort is good, but it's a truck, so it should feel like one. This truck rides high, which improves visibility. The heater is excellent. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Had this truck one month, (900 miles). I like it better every time I drive it. The seats take some getting used to. The ride is a little bumpy in town, but great on the highway. I don't care much for the tool box/basket behind the drivers seat, or the jump seats. The main issue is fuel mileage. So far I am getting 16 mpg, combined driving. I gave up a Ford Ranger I had for 12 years that performed very well. This truck has more power and is very quiet on the highway. So far not a single issue to report.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quiet is the best feature. This truck is as quiet as a Lincoln Town Car on the Highway. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Have had a Chevy 1500 in the past, just traded in my Xterra. This truck has impressed me since the day I bought it. Great power, smooth ride. Gas mileage better than the 2002 xterra, even with the bigger engine. I have friends with Fords, Dodges (all 2005 or newer)that are full sized, would pick this truck every time. Price is great...performance even better. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After driving,a Ford Ranger for several years and a Chevy Colorado for 1 year, this truck is a dream to drive. Much smoother and quieter than the other small trucks that I have driven in the past.This truck also has more power than I will ever use and at the same time has a good gas mpg rating for a truck. Back seat works great for extra passengers or folds flat for extra interior cargo space. So far it rates a 10. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the truck recently, and have, from the 1st drive been very impressed. Kept in low rpms the truck is sedate and quiet, but above 3000 it moves - and growls. The interior is the best made of any recent Nissan, even on my cloth SE every surface is nice to the touch. Lots of cubbies and drink holders, too. The exterior looks great, again, even on the SE you get a good amount of nice Chrome. The standard spray on bedliner and 4 wheel disk brakes are great features. Finally, I got this V6 4wd for best same as a 'best offer' on a 4cyl 4wd Tacoma. It wasn't even a competition.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Surprisingly, the ride. The ride is more compliant than I expected from a pick-up. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This truck is awesome! I looked at Toyota but the style of the frontier sold me on Nissan. The $1,500 incentive was also nice. The larger alloy wheels looked so much nicer then then the standard ones and you can get them with the SE value package. It's a good deal. You get the bed extender, cruise, power, VSS, mats, and the wheels for around $1,300. It really makes a huge difference in my opinion. The gas mileage stinks, but so does Toyota. It's a 4X4 truck so you should expect that. I ended up paying $23,500 after the incentive, but the dealer gave me less then I wanted for a trade so figure I really spent $24,500. Not a bad deal. I'm very happy with the truck and recommend it over Toyota.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We compared several trucks for the last few weeks. Ford, they wanted too much for the Sportrac; Toyota, they don't make any deals, and the rest are the rest. This is my wife's car, and she loves it because it handles as a car on the highway and as a truck in the country. The only complain so far are the seats; they need more support and the arm rest are out of place. Over all, it is very nice truck with a teen looking. </TEXT>

<TEXT>'Bought a Hardbody new in '87...best purchase I ever made. 'Bought the Frontier last weekend; great truck. 'Looking forward to a lot of miles with this one, too. Avalanche color with Steel cloth interior. Alloys. 6' bed. Nice ride. Smooth, quick motor. Seamless cruise engagement. More rear leg-room than the '98 F-150 cab-and-a- half LWB I traded in. I've read comments about the large turning radius, but it's more maneuverable that the Ford. Shopped for seven weeks before settling on this one...definitely worth the wait.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded my truly excellent 2005 Tundra TRD 4x4 for this smaller truck. But don't let it fool you- the bed is quite nearly the same size. Acceleration is better and my max noted MPG was 21 on the hwy the other morning. Avg MPG seems to be 17.5 to 18.5. The NISMO 4x4 drives like a car- the suspension is tight and accurate, low center-of-gravity for a 4x4 but has enough clearance for most Jeep trails in TX. WAY more power than the Tacoma with more features for less money. Had a Titan before the Tundra and it was junk but Nissan has been making compacts much longer than they have been making full-sized. Give the Titan another couple years. Enjoy the Frontier today.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Back-in-the-seat power. Super-smooth 5spd auto. Excellent stock stereo. Fullsize bed. Plastic interior is easy to clean and still feels solid. Seats are good and dash is easy to use. Steering wheel audio is a life-saver. Cruise control is spot-on and never overrevs.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is my first p/u and the vehicle is very nice to drive. Smooth, quiet,and handles very well. The 5 speed auto shifts nicely and the engine has excellent power. The ride is not busy on the highway. I drove a Tacoma with similar equipment and found it to be not has sure footed. The ride in the Tacoma was unsettled at highway speeds. The Rockford/Fosgate stereo is very nice indeed. I have the leather interior, it is very comfortable. Even my wife likes to drive it. We have owned Nissan cars since 1987 and we were never disappointed.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought new in Oct. Great power,very fast. Very nice clean design interior and exterior. 4wd works very well in the snow. Better than expected fuel mileage approx 19mpg avg. Excellent value. A few small gripes show that I am spoiled and have forgotten how crappy my Ford was: A small squeak that comes from the back right corner of the cab, large turning radius, lots of wind noise, interior plastic scratches way too easily. Inside is nice and clean in design but could use some more luxurious touches like Tacoma. Still a great Value, I would buy another one. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Not impressed with build quality... Drive train is great, interior rattles n' shakes. Have had numerous small issues with gas gage and rattles. Dealer service is absolutely the worst. Tried multiple dealers and all provided the worst service I have ever seen. Mechanics were poorly trained, and management had a "go away" attitude. This is not the Nissan I have loved in the past. I sold an F150 to get better gas mileage in the city, and I miss it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have only had my Frontier for a few weeks but by far it is a great improvement over my 2005 F150. Had tranny problems with that at 15,000 miles. Got tired of fighting it and traded off. This is faster, drives better and gets way better mileage then F150. great value. Toyota was way out of line on price and a dog compared to this Frontier. </TEXT>

<TEXT>After researching all the medium and small size trucks my choice was the Nissan Frontier. All the nice features, style, design make it a better choice. The Toyota Tacoma would be my second choice but I paid $2,500 less for a Frontier with the same choices. Plus those sales guys at Toyota are really difficult, they want you to pay MSRP and don't like to deal. The new Long bed on the Frontier makes it an excellent choice, if you compare the size of the bed to the Titan there is not much difference... I love my truck!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck was the best of all the midsized trucks I drove. It had the smoothest ride. Better than the Tacoma. It seemed to have more power also. During the first highway drive home my wife fell asleep, so that speaks to the comfort both of the ride and of the seats. The 5 speed automatic Transmission shifts smoothly and not too frequently, I believe this is because of the excessive torque of the engine. It does not have to down shift very often. The truck weighs more than the Tacoma this gives a better ride and a stronger truck for less money. If you are wondering How I liked the Ford the Dodge or the Chevy lets just say I bought the Nissan and leave it at that. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The best feature is the tiedown & rail system in the bed. It can fit any configuration and if you like even more options they are available as extras</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the drive train and suspension on this truck - it drives like a sports car and is a blast to run the 2.5L 4 banger through the gears. My complaint? I can't find a comfortable position for the driver's seat. The door panel encroaches on my leg space, the front lip of the seat digs into my thighs, and the seat bottom/back is just plain hard. I'm now considering options such as a custom seat, upgrade seats from a wrecked SE/LE, or possibly reupholstering. The uncomfortable seats are starting to sour me on an otherwise wonderful truck. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Driving my mom's tacoma trd after my nismo frontier i noticed this: The frontier is noticeably faster/more powerful. The steering is easier in the tacoma. The frontier had more hip/knee room. Tacoma is quieter. Fronter is sportier. Tacoma sits a tad higher. Frontier has much better price. Tacoma has prettier interior. Frontier has better functionality of interior. Tacoma has nicer wheels. Frontier gets better mileage 19avg vs. 16avg. for tacoma. Tacoma has better bed. Frontier has nicer one piece fenders. Trucks are essentially equal.The difference is Frontier is sportier and for young people.Tacoma is more luxurious and for older people.oh yeah frontier has real chrome bumpers. like em both</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought this truck after comparing with the Tacoma. The Tacoma is 5 grand more money and the Nissan has the power. The truck has a real solid feel. The utility track system in the bed is a great idea and I am looking forward to the first time I have to tie something down. When the truck is idling, you can tell it is a powerhouse. I haven't owned it that long to encounter any problems. I haven't had any so far. Hopefully, I won't. Fuel economy could be better, but you can't have it both ways. I had a Matrix. 32mpg, but no power or size. This truck has some weight to it and is a real powerhouse</TEXT>

<TEXT>Not much change from the '06 but the value power package (new in '07) is a must. Not as smooth over rough roads as my Ranger. The power is awesome. I know gas mileage is a common complaint, but I'm getting over 21 mpg in town! And it's supposed to get better once the engine gets broken in. I only got 19 with my Ranger with a much smaller engine. The turning radius is, well, non-existent. Don't try a U-turn at an intersection. The transmission is incredible smooth. I cannot feel it shift. Overall, I'm very impressed with the look and quality.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I needed a truck. After I got this one I wasn't getting the mpg I thought I should. Well, one night I was on the interstate and I went just below 2000 rpm, about 1800 and locked in the cruise control. My mpg went up to over 24. My speed was about 65. With the present gas prices this might help you get some better mpg. Now I don't feel so bad. I like this truck. Mine is a 2 wheel drive Nismo with automatic. My best mpg is 27 using this method. I avg about 24 on the highway. Around town , 17 like everyone else. Hope this helps. You can go up to just about any speed and cut your rpms to about 1800 (or a little above) and improve your mpg.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Very fun truck to drive. Practicle, especially since it has bigger capabilities than it's size. One downfall is the service provided by Nissan. Every problem that has occured with this truck, was turned into a big headache for myself. Currently my dealer refuses to acknowledge that my 6spd clutch has a defect and wants to charge me over $1200 for a new one. I officially documented the complaint at 15k miles though I had the issue from new. There are several cases of this specific defect, which should be warrantied. My dealer refuses. Love the truck, hate the service, and I reccomend buying an automatic, due to relaiability. This is not the only problem with the truck, just the most prevelant</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought new to replace an '01 2wd Crew Cab SE which was a great truck. I was moving to the Midwest and wanted 4wd. Great advances since then, better in all aspects to the '01. Great motor with acceptable mileage for a truck. I get about 15-16 city, 21+ highway. Some folks don't like the interior, but I don't mind the plastic. It's put together well, and easy to keep clean. Gauges/controls are clear/logically ordered. Sound quality of speakers is good. I primarily an iPod via the aux jack. There is an iPod interface on the 2008s. Get that instead of the disc changer if you can. You might want to consider step rails as it's relatively high off the ground.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Frontier crew cab has nice road feel - stable and solid, a comfortable ride and great space utilization options behind the driver seat. I think with a few improvements/options it could fit the needs of lots more customers than it currently attracts and could be a perfect choice for those of us looking for an all around vehicle with versatility and don't need a truck for towing or offroading. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>In addition to the flip up back seats & removable headrests I mentioned before, this is the shortest of the crew cab pickups at 205.5 inches (not counting Subaru Baja) so I can fit it in the garage! Its easier to get in and out of than a Tacoma. Lots of compliments on deep red color.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This truck is great, I've shopped the competition and found this to be the best deal. I'm getting 18.9 mpg average in summer and 17.8 average in winter. I've upgraded to 89 octane this winter for a 1-2 mpg boost. you may get 16 mpg in the cold on 87 octane. I'm gonna try 93 and see if it is overall cheaper or not. I've got 6,000 miles on the truck and have had no problems at all. the 4wd works great, snow and hills are nothing. Great truck!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The frontier king cab is pretty nice, it does have some flaws that you have to look for. The king cab is ok if you are going to put a baby back there. I would go with a crew cab next time, also the interior is cheap looking but that's ok, it's a truck. The clock radio should be different color, can't read if the sun is out. I do hear a noise under the dash board sometimes and also when I spin the tires I hear a funny noise, the wide turn stinks. Overall the truck is nice, if you are looking for room for back passengers definitely go with the crew cab. Fuel mileage could be better for a 6 cyl. Also my brakes squeak a lot.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought truck in Jan '07, & have irritating 'clanging/rattling' sound that occurs at medium rpm around 30 mph. Sounds like a heat shield. Took to Niisan dealer & was told it was the catalytic converter, that there was nothing they could do. This is unnaceptable for a 23k truck! Very comfortable, good power, OK mileage for a truck.

<TEXT>I wrote a review called '3 Months and still love it'. I have now driven my truck in both summer and winter (live in the Northeast). I have also gotten over my initial 'new car happy' feeling, but believe me: I'm still very happy with my truck. I took fuel economy down one notch because in four wheel drive I know it's depressingly low. All vehicles are low in 4WD though, so don't skip this truck because of that. The power is still great, handles like a dream, and there has been ZERO snowpiles or unplowed roads that I could not get through. I live in a city built on a hill where they don't know how to plow, and I still haven't had a single problem in the snow.</TEXT>

Bought the truck used and use it to read meters in central florida and the truck rides pretty darn good. Had to put a small lift kit on it for ground clearance but the truck can take a beating and keep on going. Dislikes are horrible blindspot on the kingcab and not so great turning radius which everyone else has stated. Tows my 18' flats boat pretty good, can't complain for a 4 banger.

<TEXT>We have had Nissan cars before, so when we decided to get a truck the Frontier or Titan were the options to consider. After test drive of a Frontier, the choice was real easy. We have just over 4000 miles in two months - no issues what so ever so far. First cross country drive, (1600 miles) towing a 1000 LBS trailer with a 4000 LBS load we got 17 MPG, second longer drive (no trailer, but a SNUG bed cover) we got 21 MPG - I'm sure we'll see 23-25 MPG when we have put 20,000 miles or so on it. By the way, all my driving is at max legal speed, but from a stand still I don't floor it, I can spare the lost 10 seconds. </TEXT>

Hauls three kids, 4,000 lb boat, and all our gear with room & power to spare. Blasted through 12-24 inch snow drifts before any plows had a chance to clear the roads after a nasty Michigan storm. Have pulled many friends' full sized domestics from sloppy mudholes while hunting/fishing up north. Drive around 22,000-25,000 mi per year, no issues as of yet.

<TEXT>Traded an '06 Honda Ridgeline for the Frontier SE and I am extremely happy with my decision. The Ridge was an okay vehicle, but not a true truck. The short bed was a negative, the squatting of the rear end while towing was not acceptable and the mileage was pitiful at 13 to 14 mpg. The Frontier is a great, good looking real truck with ample towing capacity (6,500 with the V-6) great looks, good ride and a very powerful, with a lot of torque V- 6 engine. My full size motorcycle fits very well in the bed and when towing a trailer, you don't even notice you are pulling something back there. This truck will burn rubber any time you want to from a dead stop.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Was set on a Tacoma. Looked at the Frontier in the 11th hour. The stock and option values were better. The 6 is a great value for lots of extra power, but I wont be doing any heavy hauling. Also nice to have that extra power on tap but as the price of gas goes up-my need for speed goes down. The 2.5 isnt exactly a small 4 anyway. I took mine through the gears @3000 rpm and found the power more than adequate. It's too new to check the gas mileage but I'm sure it will be decent after switching to full synthetic Mobil 1. There are some minor negatives, but overall this is a great truck. Perfect size. Nicest looking.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in my 01 Supercharged Frontier Crew Cab 4x4 with 160K + miles, having had no problems with it, on an 07 Frontier. The turning radius is horrible. The driver's door should have a handle on it; when open and you are seatbelted in, it is hard to close. Console should be forward to use as an armrest or be moveable. The dash has several creases and pieces, where dust and dirt can get, just does not look finished, and looks worse than my 01 dash. My gas mileage mixed driving is 17.7, which is 3 mpg better than my underpowered 01 SC Frontier. Love the sunroof, the Nismo sits very high, stereo is nice, mileage read out good, overall very happy.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked at the Toyota Tacoma, Chevy Colorado, and Honda Ridgeline before buying my Frontier Crew Cab LE V6. Frontier is better than all; it's very close to the Tacoma but the Toyota's need for premium gas turned me away. The Frontier is not perfect; the seat fabric could be better, the turning radius is poor, and the console is too low/far back. The worst negative is the bump steer when driving at highway speeds; it's a little distracting until you get used to it (keep two hands on the wheel and it's not so bad). However, the acceleration is awesome (I added a K&N filter and gained a couple more HP). Gas mileage is what I expected (avg 18 mpg - hey it's a truck not a hybrid). </TEXT>

<TEXT>So far so good, about 16.1 MPG, but that is driving the speed limit, and trying to get good mileage. I wish they had left the gas tank on the passenger side, few cars have it there, never a line as the pump. Good build quality, really nice seats for cloth, like all the cup holders, and the small storage area under the back seat. Seats are comfortable, wish Nissan offered leather and auto seats with the Nismo. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sunroof by far. Not a pop up like on my 2001 Frontier, but a full sunroof, moonroof that pops up, but also will totally open. It is positioned perfectly, not load, not too windy, and a good size. Like the stereo too, the Rockford Fosgate system is nice. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a very fun truck to own. It replaced a stolen F-150 which I liked very much, but this is actually more truck for the money. Gas mileage is what you'd expect from a 261 hp V6 and the ride is good. I love the 6M transmission and it shifts like a car. I finally got a chance to fully use the 4wd low in Escalante National Monument in Utah and I can say this truck certainly has the ability to craw up steep slopes. Overall, I have been very pleased with the truck. My only complaint has been a consistent rattle on the driver's side rear door that I will have looked at under warranty. At 3500 miles, I can fully endorse this truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove the 6-cylinder versions and the fun-factor was right off the top of the charts. I really didn't need 261 HP though, and the poor mileage that went with it so I opted for the 4-cylinder XE with all the power options. It's not nearly as powerful as the 6, but the 4 cylinder is more than adequate for my needs. I'm averaging just over 21 mpg and it's improving a little with each tankful as the engine breads in. I'd recommend this vehicle to anyone in the market; good build quality, wonderful ride, and fun to drive. Count me as a happy customer.</TEXT>

Also, the key fob had a way of easily being hit. I set off the car alarm at least 15 times in 6 months. Gas mileage is fair. I averaged about 17-18 mpg and about 20 on the highway. Stereo is crappy to say the least. That said, it was fun to drive, had great acceleration, I like the tie down system in the bed and my daughter loved riding in it.

White-knuckles on the steering wheel. 3.) The knobs for the a/c controls couldn't feel any cheaper. It feels like they are about to break off every time I touch them. 4.)

<TEXT>I have had my Frontier for two months and while I think the overall ride is great for a truck, I cannot seem to get comfortable in the driver's seat. I am 6'2", 190 pounds with a slender build, but it still seems I'm too big for the seats. How does the average American fit in to these seats. The sides of the seat are poking in to the sides of my rear end and no matter how I adjust my location in the seat it is still uncomfortable. Also, when I have the seat in a fairly upright position I have very little headroom, so I have to keep the set reclined a little more than I would like.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased this truck to replace '00 Sonoma. The difference is night and day. The quality of build is fantastic. It is very sturdy and refined. The 4 cyl of course is not as fast as the 6, but I cruise effortlessly at 75-80 mph. I have driven it in the mountains of Arizona and it has plenty of power going uphill. This is complemented by the excellent handling and nicely geared transmission. I average about 24 mpg without the AC and 22 with. This truck is the perfect size as it provides realistic space for short term rear passengers without compromising the bed, and still fits in a standard garage.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second Nissan pickup. The first was a 97, now being driven by my daughter; yeah, they don't wear out. We're still waiting for the first major repair on that vehicle. I purchased this just a month ago, the XE with the Power Package, and the Value Truck package, basically the "old man" options that really make it comfortable. It's my daily driver, rock solid with good fuel economy. The 4-cylinder is not a good choice if you are going to be towing frequently, as the power is lacking. If you REALLY need the extra power, buy the 6, but be prepared for a large drop in mileage. I'm delighted with mine and will drive it for a long long time!</TEXT>

<TEXT>When I set off to ID a replacement for my little 01 Toyota Tacoma, I wanted to match its overall reliability, maneuverability and fuel economy but also gain a roomier interior, 4 doors, horsepower, a more civilized ride and a few bells and whistles. Some internet research and a few test drives quickly steered me towards the Frontier over the Tacoma and Colorado. The "Fronty" (CrewCab, 5' bed) had big truck power, ride and interior room without being gas thirsty and a PITA to park/drive in tight places. It also, IMHO, had better styling and initial build quality than the others. (My Taco was a rattle trap!) I got 20% off/ below invoice on a loaded LE with little effort. Try that with Toyota.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Where to start?! Performance, civilized ride, spacious and quiet interior, body style, better than hoped (18.5+) MPG, bed/cargo management system (!) price, and last but not least, It's NOT another Toyota </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you're looking for a vehicle that is fun to drive, this is it. I took the Toyota Tacoma for a drive then the Nissan and there is no comparison. The Nissan generated much more power as soon as you touched the gas. I punched the gas on the Toyota and it could just about get out of its way. Take the both for a ride and I'm sure you will buy Nissan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I upgraded from an '03 Xterra. Talk about a night and day difference in performance, power, and ride. The '07 Frontier LE Crew Cab 4x4 has a smooth and comfortable ride. At times it even feels like I'm driving a luxury car. The 261 hp, 4.0L engine is top notch. Nissan has a winner here!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I totalled my Toyota Tacoma into a deer running across the road, limped into Nissan, and bought this truck on the spot. After a 130 mile trip back home, I fell in love with it. I recommend this truck over the Toyota, which I had put on nearly 200,000 miles. 2000 Tacoma by the way. The 4.0 runs very well, effortless, even at altitude here in Wyoming! </TEXT>

<TEXT>Much more stable and comfortable ride than the Tacoma. Better engine shifting (much smoother, quieter and feels more powerful overall). MPG for most trucks is not very good and this is no exception. So far about 17 mpg on the highway (but have only driven it 300 miles so far, and it seemed to improve the longer we drove). The Nismo trim is fabulous off-road in both the 4 x 2 and 4 x 4 version, like buttah! The traction control is a great feature on the 4 x 4 and very useful in inclement conditions. We are thrilled with our NISMO 4 x 4 but urge all automakers to increase the mpg on all trucks (and create some retrofits for those of us who already own your vehicles). </TEXT>

<TEXT>Looked at both the Frontier and the Dakota. Chose the Frontier (storm grey color, steel grey int) due to proven reliability, also the interior materials looked much better than the Dakota. Frontier has a quiet car-like ride to it, outstanding getup and go when you need it. A/C is good and cold, getting 20-21 mpg so far on hwy. The bed extension works really well when slid up near the cab to keep stuff from sliding all over the bed. With 2 boys, cup holders throughout the truck come in real handy. Would have gotten LE Crew cab, wanted Blue exterior (can't get on SE), but would have had to have roof rack (standard on LE crew), which I thought looked ugly on truck.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seats, 4 doors, bed liner and sliding bed extension. Outstanding power, good solid sound when you closing door. Standard stereo plays really clear. Like the 16 in tires, they ride very well, less expensive to replace than 18 in tires.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>WOW Best for your $$</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>We had a 2002 Frontier. It had 89,000 on it and the only thing went bad was we had to replace the darn battery, can you imagine. We traded it in on a 2007 with 261 HP V6 4x4, wow. A lot more truck than the 2002. 1. The best is way more power. 2. The double doors no extra charge. 3. It is a bigger truck, bed is 10" wider, inside is bigger for more room. 4. Finally they changed the darn emergency brake to a hand and the gas fill is on the driver's side. 5. Just looks nicer inside, interior is as good or better, roomy and comfortable. 6 4x4 shift is just a dial now. GREAT for moms in bad weather.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Truck runs great, drives great, however I have a "bump start" feel on launch from a stop. Very annoying. Drive shaft already replaced but they are looking at it again this week. Too much grease in the slip yoke causing the drive shaft to "hang" or stick and release when the brakes are released and you accelerate. It feels like the axle moves out from under the truck and then the truck moves. I can only feel it in the seat. You can put the truck in neutral and it won't do it as it takes the pressure off of the shaft and it equalizes. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like its looks and the power of the 4.0L. It is very well built. Features of more expensive trucks are already on these truck. The engineers listened to consumers apparently. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was only looking at the Tacoma and Ridgeline when the Frontier emerged as a darkhorse. I've been very impressed all the way around.

<TEXT>I bought the truck with 75 miles on it last 11/26/06 and was pretty impressed initially. I have had the vehicle in the shop twice now for engine mount problems. I picked the truck up and it sounded good for 40 miles and the sound is back so it will be going in again for service. Overall the truck isn't too bad for what I paid for it.

<TEXT>I owned a 1994 Nissan pickup and decided it was time to update. The Nissan is a dream to drive, and the 4 cyl provides enough power and fuel economy to boot. The economics proved in favor of the Nissan with getting the preferred, power, bed liner packages for $1000 less than a lesser equipped Tacoma. A very satisfied return Nissan owner.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have been researching both vehicles over the past 2 months and decided to go with the Nismo Frontier Crew. I recommend everyone to test both first. The reason I chose the Nissan over Toyota was for the overall build and engineering of the truck. When you test drive the Toyota look at the liftgate then look at the liftgate on the Nissan. The liftgate on the Nissan was much thicker and more heavyduty on the Nissan. It felt like a full size truck liftgate. Also when you are test driving the Toyota spend some time and look underneath the vehicle. The components underneath seem very thin and weak where as the Nissan looks like it could take a land mine and keep going. This is a strong truck!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Manual, 4x2 air, 4-cyl, cruise, preferred package. Power is OK for a 2.5L, at least when I can get the gear of my choice. Pleasant drive, capable of doing almost everything a light-duty truck and daily commuter vehicle could be expected to offer. I got more for my money with the Frontier. The king cab has non-adult rear seats; if you want to use them, get the crew cab.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Checked Tacoma, Ranger, and Colorado. Frontier has good road visibility, good seating and the gas mileage we wanted. Cargo capacity is generous, ABS brakes effective and love the King Cab. Sad to give up our 1989 Chevy S10 but are very pleased with this new member to our family. For us, it is a great light duty hauler in the 4 cylinder version. The 4 cylinder is adequate but nothing snappy. The overdrive is easily engaged or disengaged in hill climbing or descent. 4 wheel ABS is very good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love everything about this truck, the way it looks, the way it drives, the cupholders, the sound system, seating position and yes, even the fuel economy. I got 21.25 mpg on my last tank with mixed driving. I do use the cruise control whenever possible but I sincerely doubt there are many other V-6 4x4s out there that can make that claim. I think it will give me 23 -24 mpg for all hwy miles. The overall value is awesome.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my 4th truck. Looks are awesome. Truck has plenty of power better than my chevy with a 305 V-8. Cargo features are nice. Rides great. Could get a bit better fuel mileage (my average is 18 Miles) but I think Nissan traded performance for fuel economy. Turning radius is not good. Don't try to u-turn with busy traffic. My only complaint was driver side left foot rest took up too much space. I removed it and made a much better flat surface with rubber top - worked great. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Handsome inside and out, good build quality, and comfortable. Too new to tell on reliability, but it's already leading me to high expectations. Not a bad little engine and an easy clutch, though I wish the gear box felt more certain and direct through the stick to my hand. My only real complaint is that the truck suffers terribly from bump steer. You don't even have to be going very fast to be startled by it. Hit some bumps while going around the curve (or even going straight for that matter), and the wheels leave the road to come down some place different. That aside, it's a nice driving truck and represents a very good value. I'm happy with my purchase.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I researched both the Nissan Frontier and Toyota Tacoma trucks. Of the two the Nissan was a better value. It cost less to purchase, had lower maintenance costs and resale was comperable, based on initial purchase price) after 5 yrs. The reliability is the same as the Toyota and the features are better. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Disc brakes all around, more comfortable seating, higher performance engine, sprayed in bed liner was standard and it has a better system to secure cargo in the bed.

<TEXT>I've had the truck about one month and so far, I love it. Mine has just about every available option and is really comfortable and attractive. I haven't taken it off-road yet, but the highway ride is outstanding. I compared it to the Tacoma, but ended up going with the Frontier for its better ride and more available options. The Frontier also feels more powerful to me, although supposedly the Tacoma is faster. Both are good trucks, I just thought I got more for the money with the Nissan. Bottom line is that I strongly recommend this truck.</TEXT>

I was sold on the power of the truck and the optional features that was offered.The Frontier had a lot of leg room and the seats were real comfortable. I think Nissan did their homework with the Frontier and I would pick this truck over any of the mid size trucks out there.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is a great truck. In the past I have had two full size trucks, the last being a Nissan Titan. I was concerned about going to the Frontier because of the loss in towing capacity. I have had the Frontier for 2 months now and would say it is an outstanding truck. It is "zippy" and much easier to maneuver than the past two full sizers I have owned. As for towing, I tow a Bobcat S130 (4800 lbs) at least once a week and have no trouble whatsoever. The Frontier performs without flaw. The 4-door cab will truely haul 4 people. The 4wd will really pull this truck out of trouble (even towing a trailer through mud). I highly recommend this truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The crew cab LWB model has a somewhat long turning radius but it also has all the interior seating room you would want without any loss of bed space. The roof rack, flip up rear seats, spray-in liner, tie-down system locking tailgate and other features beat the competition. The truck has lots of power and yet has a quiet ride. The ride is nice and the seating position is preferable to the Tacoma. Gas mileage in the first 3 tanks has ranged from 17.5 to over 20 mpg in mixed driving, assuming that you don't get your foot into it too much. Gas mileage seems to be improving as the miles add up. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Roof rack, spray-in liner, tie-down system, locking tailgate, nice ride, lots of power. The LE Frontier comes with many additional features and is a few thousand less than a Tacoma TRD. Both are great trucks but the Frontier seems to be a better value. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>So far I've been more happy than not. There are the little things that everyone else mentions (mpg, blind spot caused by rear seat headrests, console too far back, and poor turning radius). If I had to pick the most annoying issue it would be the poor turning radius. I can't remember the last time I've made so many 3 point turns. It's irritating but I'm adjusting. You just have to plan out your route prior to initiating a turn. On the plus side the power is great, truck is solid and smooth (feels like your going 60 mph when you're actually going 80 mph) and interior comfort is good. </TEXT>

An unexpected problem: my wife LOVES the truck, so occasionally I go outside to go somewhere, and I see our old Tiberon instead of the Frontier.</TEXT>
