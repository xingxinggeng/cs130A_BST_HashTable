<TEXT>I agree with the guy who has the wind noise coming through the door seal or window seal. I have taken my Armada to the dealership more than a dozen times and they say the same thing, they have no idea what it is. It is frustrating. I hear the wind more when it is cold outside or hitting a pretty good bump in the road. And he is right about the moon roof. Mine rattles and the dealership can't fix that either. Other than those issues I enjoy the truck. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I've owned 2 Jeeps, 4 Blazers, a Bravo,5 loaded Tahoes. This SUV is miles above these in performance (Tahoes close). Tahoe interior is more comfortable & pleasing. Rides like a sports car if one knows how to drive it. Staggering power readily avail. when needed. Handling amazing for such a large unit. Wonderfully controllable in all driving situations. Not ideal for average soccer moms but terrific for serious drivers w/ fun, work, and quality travel in mind. I own a Jag and a Mercedes sports car. When behind wheel of Armada I don't feel loss of control or power as one might expect after driving true sports cars. The difference in cornering is obvious but not uncomfortably or dangerously so.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Powerful engine. Enjoyable manual shifting when desired with the consul- mount lever. Bose sound system. Ground clearance. Driveability. Sound braking. Safety features. Heated seats. Power rear view mirrors. Power rear door. Large wheels & wide wheel base. Easy interior conversion for cargo storage.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Armada! I was rear ended by a Water Tanker Truck when I was stopped at a traffic light. And I wasn hit so hard,that I crashed into an Police car stopped in front of me. I found out from the police report that the tanker weighed over 33 thousand pounds. What a scare. But,I was barely scratched. I was not hospitalized and I was back to work the very next morning. I owe all of this to the fantastic design of the Armada. I WILL be an Armada owner from now on. Thanks Nissan.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I love this suv. I've been a loyal Nissan owner for many years now, but the armada has a couple issues. 1. When you hit a bump while turning the wheel wants to over steer, making the vehicle unstable momentarily. 2. When it is windy and there is a slight cross wind (over 20 mph) the wind comes through the door seal opposite from where the wind is coming. (dealer does not believe us no matter how many print outs of similar problems we bring in). This last trip we went on it was windy and raining and we had water dripping inside the cab. 3. Sunroof vibrates from time to time. They can't find it. 4. Interior plastic scratches way too easy </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Bose system rocks, great towing, when you step on it it goes, looks great</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased my SUV over a year ago and just love it. Parent with teenagers, always room for all the kids and bikes. No problems with anything and the Nissan service dept is excellent for regular maintenance. I recently purchase a small car (another Nissan) for gas purposes but refused to give up my Armada. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I was incented to buy the Armada a year and a half ago because of its 1) class-leading legroom, 2) my positive experience with Nissan SUVs in the past decade, and 3) it is built in the US (Mississippi). Have had no problems with it. The mileage is awful but I have a very small commute and don't put alot of miles on it, so it's not a crusher. And we take a few driving family vacations a year that this is an absolute treat to travel in. Highly recommended!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Legroom for miles! Very comfortable XM radio. Nav system. Rear camera / radar. Drives more nimbly than its size.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I wanted an suv that had plenty of room and was safe for my toddler son. After test driving my Armada I knew it was perfect. It is much more accessible than a Tahoe or Yukon. I read many reviews on here to see what everyone else had to say about the Armada and realized that gas was the biggest concern. Safety was my biggest issue so we went ahead and purchased it and are happy that it gets 17 miles to the gallon in the city. It is as big as a house, we have room for days, and the gas mileage is not much worse than a midsize. I am glad I chose an Armada.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The comfort and ride are wonderful, I pulled someone out of a snow bank 2 days after getting the truck, and I have had to pull my parents Avalon out of the snow a couple times. Great owner websites out there to answer any questions or enlighten you to mods. Remember this is a truck, not a hybrid! The V8 is SO smooth snd shifting is seemless. The ABLS and VDC system is incredible in the snow, drive it during a storm and test it! I started looking in 04 for a new SUV, I researched and drove everything except this one, I rented one for a week, and then bought one!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my second 07 Armada. We had an accident with our first one, we got t-boned by an RV. The Armada held up excellent, even so it was later declared a total loss, it got us 40 miles to the next town. It kept all of us safe, even so the frame got damaged. After the loss we went and bought the same truck again. We also have a 9000 lbs trailer which we tow without any problems. I did not notice any of the brake problems a lot of people refer to. I stop that truck out of 60 mph with trailer safe and sound in a heartbeat. I love my Armada, wish so they would provide a diesel engine as alternative. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Armada has all you need for an SUV, when I purchased the truck I had to put it to the test, so me and 4 of my buddys took a road trip to south beach miami. Needless to say 4 fully grown men fell asleep 20 min into the trip. They all said that that this truck was smooth, and roomy, and the bose sound system was really nice. They gave the truck tens all around. The only thing is this truck does eat gas so know that when you purchase this vehicle, but all SUVs are gas guzzlers. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The Armada is exceptional to say the least. I compared it to the Yukon Denali. After driving both, it was a "no-brainer". The Armada wins! I love the style, the engine is very quiet and the Bose sound system is a plus as well. If you're looking for an SUV with a lot of "bang for not a lot of money" then this is a great buy. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded my 2006 Pathfinder for this 2007 Armada LE. We need a car that can make our trip with two kids fun and ARMADA is more than what we expected. The car came with navigation, sunroof and XM radio but no DVD and that is the only thing we had to add aftermarket which cost us $1,500. Nissan really did a superb job with this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Wow this thing is a gas guzzler. What was I thinking when I purchased this thing. I always wanted an Armada, so I bought one but with big regrets. Too many blind spots. I have a hard time seeing when I am trying to back out of a parking space. While this thing is very powerful, the gas mileage is awful. I paid cash for mine. I am going to trade it in in about another month for something that gets better gas mileage. If you want good gas mileage, this is not the vehicle for you. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Test drove the Tahoe and liked it but once my wife and I got in the Armada, we knew this was the choice. Lots of room inside and seemed to have a much tighter ride then the Tahoe. Love the power for towing. My wife thought it had less of a truck feel than other SUVs we tested.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Fold flat seats (unlike the Tahoe), leg room, overall ride. Base model came with most of the goodies I wanted. Middle bench seats has lots of comfort. Third row seat standard.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After going back and forth between the Armada and the new Tahoe we finally decided on the Armada. No regrets at all. Tons of power to tow a 6500 lb boat. I'm 6'5" tall; the Armada was way more roomy for me and for the rest of the family. My wife and I really liked the standard features (too many to list) over the competition. Best bang for the buck. Way to go Nissan!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, handling, towing ability, Bose, roomy, fold-flat seating, auto-level rear suspension, and base model incuded features. This is what really drove our decision over the Tahoe. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought this car after doing extensive research. After a lot of test drives and time, I bought the armada. It is a great car. Plenty of room for all of my kids (3) with room for 3 friends in addition. I got a great deal on the car. If this gives you an idea of how smooth the ride is - I drove 2 miles down a dirt road and had forgotten to get 2 screws off the bumper. After arriving at the destiniation, they were still there!! I love it, the kids love it, my husband loves it and people ask me what kind of car it is all of the time. it has been turning heads left and right! I will buy a Nissan again - without a doubt!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Leather, C.D., steering wheel controls, 2 trips (one business, one personal), temp gauge, LEG ROOM IS AMAZING!! All three rows have plenty of leg room - very impressive - great value!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the second Armada I have purchased since 2005. My overall experience has been very rewarding. The vehicle displays very satisfying levels of control and power. Acceleration is awesome for a vehicle of this size. Fit and finish is first rate. Interior noise level is acceptable. Very good sound system. Brake issues appear to have been resolved.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The integrated DVD / radio system is fantastic for families on the go. Once you learn how to operate it, you'll love it.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I thought long and hard about buying my first truck/suv that what not a gm product. I have no regrets at all. We took a short spring break trip and had a blast in the new Armada. I am very impressed with this vehicle so far. It is very quiet and smooth, with a nice sound from the v8! And it is responsive!! My only regret is I wish I could have afforded the 4wd. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Power, interior layout and exterior that stands out from all the others that are too similar. Quiet ride. Leg room in all rows. Map lights for rear passengers. Floor shifter is cool. My wife likes that it is easier to park than the suburban we traded in.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>this car is totally amazing... we just bought it and it is amazing, it responds so quickly when you accelerate (compared to the 06 Isuzu Ascender i traded in, which is a GMC ENVOY LOOK-A-LIKE) the armada's style is amazing... the visibility and for me a 6'4ft guy... it makes me feel small which never happens. also the chrome detail are amazing even though i got the base model, the chrome makes it look so expensive, which it was but it is worth every penny. nissan did an amazing job on it.. everyone always stares at it.. it makes me feel good. and the Bose sound system is amazing </TEXT>

<TEXT>After being a die-hard chevy owner for the past 22 years, we decided to give the Nissan Armada a try (we were also considering the Suburban and GMC Yukon). We needed to increase the traveling space provided by our '05 Silverado 3/4 ton Crew Cab while maintaining the ability to pull a 7k lbs horse trailer. When we viewed the Armada, we were very impressed with the exterior design. We also liked the size as compared to a Suburban, and the price of a fully-equipped Armada as compared to a Yukon Denali. It drives wonderfully, has an impressive turn radius and is very spacious in the 2nd and 3rd row. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The automatic side mirror retraction really helps when getting into, and out of, the garage. The seat heaters are keenly appreciated and the his & hers memory seat is very useful. Love the "Sonar!"</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The armada is fun to drive. No problems as of yet. The interior space of the armada is second to none. We have three boys and two large rottweilers, plenty of space left over. We paid invoice minus rebate.</TEXT>
