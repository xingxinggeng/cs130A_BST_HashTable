<TEXT>Overall, GM did a great job with this redesign. The wife and kids love the interior. Have the Rear DVD for the kids, and I will say it is a godsend. Ride is really good, nice and smooth. Decent fit and finish. I think GM could have done better with the gas mileage. I know this is a 6,000lb truck, and I expected poor economy, but I am averaging 11-13mpg regularly around town. I hoped cruising the interstate in primarily V4 mode would help, but alas 16-18mpg on the highway. Great utility in this truck, just be aware that odds are you will get 15mpg on average, and that gets worse with E85 fuel. Other than that I love this truck, but costs to drive are too high for me. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought a gently used and fully loaded LTZ and love the truck. Just came back from 2,400 trip and was glad I took it. Plenty of room for luggage in box/trunk. Felt safe on the road being higher up. Could see great when driving in bad weather with too. Handled well even at higher speeds. Kids loved the DVD player. Bought it because wanted a box to haul things, and a size like a surburban. Sharp looking truck. Now wife wants one too. No surprise on fuel economy, 12 mpg city, 18 hwy @ 65mph. I live where there's alot of snow so the extra weight helps with traction, much less rear slippage than a pickup.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Thought it'd be a good time for this. At 50000mi my Av is doing well, with a few problems. This winter the 4WD started kicking out when the wheels slipped and dash read "service 4WD". Later this spring rear parking sensors quit. Both computer glitches, warranty fix. Oil consumption a little high, maybe a quart per 3000mi. Built-in oil life monitor would let me go over 8000mi between changes! All I've read says this monitor is as accurate as can be; so I run it to 10% life and change it. Hwy MPG as high as 19 in warm weather. Paint, fit and finish, interior leather holding up very well, just wipe down those stylin' aluminum wheels every car wash. A darn good truck, and I'm not easy on it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>STILL looks like a million bucks (metallic gray, 20" wheels). A 4WD pack mule in winter snow. Heated seats in WI winter are where it's at! Cargo carrying versitality will not let you down. Not bad MPG for a huge truck with good power. THE way to cruise down the HWY for a long trip, passengers happy.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is the best car I owned so far! The versatility of this vehicle is exceptional. Great interior and exterior designs for work and fun. I got it with the Z71 pkg. special grill, running boards, sunroof, DVD/CAM, DVD based Navigation (which is not preferred), towing kit and every things else. Black color is very nice but too hot for S. Florida. The bed cover is great and you can keep things in it with no worries. When the seats are down you have room to put drywall 4x8 and keep it enclosed. This is amazing! I was very happy with it and proud driving it but had to give it up because of fuel costs. </TEXT>

<TEXT>If you're looking to kill 2 birds with 1 stone, there is no better choice. As a homebuilder I need the function/look of a truck on a jobsite, but it cleans up so well that we use this same truck to go to church, outings, evenings out, everywhere. I've racked up 66k miles in 2.5 years and all I've done are oil changes (whenever the light tells me to) and changed a set of tires (shouldve balanced them more often, was told). I average 4-6 hrs/day in my truck when out, and could not imagine a more comfy ride and interior. At 6'1" and 250lbs it fits like a glove. Fuel economy can be an issue if you have a heavy foot, as I used to, but even though I still drive aggressively I avg 16+ mpg's city.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The backup camera with sensors makes it easier to back in than to pull forward while parking. I love the z71 trim with chrome chicken-wire grille and chrome stepbars. The navi system is nice, though they're cheaper & better aftermarket. The 4x4 is also not worth the maintenance; my diff does the job</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This truck is absolutely gorgeous, so many compliments, rivals that of my Corvette. As far as mpg not bad for what you are driving. Drives nice but I encourage all buyers to purchase air ride! Makes your $40,000 vehicle ride like a $40K should. This is a big vehicle with lots of blind spots. Get back up camera for sure! Another problem, to lower the mid gate you have to move both front seats up a lot! Not even an option for long trips. Seats aren't as comfortable as I would like but maybe it's just me. Light in bed should be controlled by tailgate not courtesy lights. I have had a few things that seem like they need replaced but I bought mine used so might just be driven rough. I love it.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Went from a Ford Expedition to this and never looked back. Rides better, handles better and is way more comfortable even on long trips since I go to Hayward WI in summers and FL in winters and travel with 70 lb Golden Retriever and wife and plenty of junk in the back. This baby offers best of both worlds from SUV to pickup. If you want a little more styling go pay another $20 grand for the Escalade version!</TEXT>

<TEXT>First brand new vehicle and first time owning a Chevy truck. Few problems initially with only 1 recall for heated wipers, which they did during oil change. Unfortunately, after rolling just 19k, transmission crapped out. I baby my truck, so when pulling out in traffic the tranny goes. I'm not a happy camper. Up to this point, have been happy with my truck. But this experience definitely leaves a sour taste. Might not go back to Chevy.</TEXT>

<AUTHOR>Best Decision I Made</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have had this truck now for almost a year with 12k miles and I could not be happier. I have had no problems with this vehicle at all and lover the styling and comfort as well as the versatility. I am always being complemented on the truck, it looks much more expensive than it really is. I have added 22" chrome wheels, chrome front and rear light accesories as well as on the back liftgate handle area. I have the LTZ pretty much loaded with the rear camera and nav, which is extremely helpful. For anyone looking for an SUV that also doubles as a truck there is nothing that compares, especially if you are looking for true 4 wheel drive. This blows the socks off of the Honda Ridgeline.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Nav with rear camera, midgate and rear removable cover, side storage compartments, luxurious interior, exterior styling and smooth ride. A real pleasure to drive you will not be dissapointed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded in a 1999 Chevy Silverado and I am very happy with the Avalanche. Chevy has definitely began to compete in the truck arena with quality vehicles, it was almost too late, but sure glad they did it for the 2007 model year, because I was leaning toward the Honda Ridgeline. I was turned off with the 2006 models. Chevy's quality, yes quality material and updated interior and exterior designs sold me. Take one for a test drive see for yourself. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We just picked up our '07 LTZ. So far it's been absolutely wonderful. We've got every option but the Nav/rear cam. Previously had a '00 Yukon, and the new platform is by far superior. Love the new interior, very high quality materials, no "cheap plastic" look that was common with GM for so long. We've been running only E85 because it's almost $0.60 cheaper here (South Dakota) than regular unleaded. We're getting about 11mpg in town and 15 or so on the highway. That compares to about 14/18 with the Yukon on 10% Ethanol. I'm going to run a tank of 10% Ethanol next time to get an idea of how well the Active Fuel Management does. So far, can't tell when it's in V4 vs. V8. Been great!!</TEXT>

<TEXT> The 2007 Avalanche delivers the "finishing touch" for its unique features,luxury,performance and technology. Truck lovers will sit-up and take notice at the design of this rugged, tough looking vehicle. Along with its powerful performance, the comfort and luxury can make you forget your driving a "truck". But when you want or need truck features, you'll not be dissapointed! The standard and optional features deliver a generous level of safety and technology that is sure to rival competitors, all at a very reasonable price. The 2007 Chevrolet Avalanche is truly an awesome driving experience. It rises to take its place as one of Chevy's "Pinnacles" in truck design. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Purchased a 2007 Avalanche last weekend. Traded in my Yukon Denali. I have always liked the concept of the Avalanche, just could not stand the body cladding. I love the 2007 style inside and out. Much needed improvement for Chevy. I have the LT version, with most of the LTZ upgrades. 20 inch wheels, sunroof, rain sensing wipers, locking differential etc. We will see how the "V4" does with the mileage. So far on my first tank I am averaging around 12mpg in city. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I love My 07 Avalanche. Great truck. Rides like a Cadillac, hauls and tows like a truck. Great camping vehicle. Great to have lockable bed. My only complaint is rear seats are not comfortable on back for a long car trip. Been back to the dealer for replacing interior door handle and 2 computer updates. Gets much better gas mileage on reg gas vs e85. Don't recommend e85. Runs sluggish and get 11-12 mpg vs 17-23.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Excellent, versatile vehicle. Can haul full sheet of plywood with tailgate shut. Excellent payload, love the fuel management features. Supurb interior, and ingenious design with the mid- gate, and removeable rear window. Truck drives like a car, or hauls like a good truck should. It does get a little cramped with the rear seats folded down. You have to move the front seats forward pretty far to get the back seats to fold down all the way. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the rear entertainment option, heated memory seat option, and the whole design of the interior. Not to mention the smooth ride, and extremely good looks.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Purchased my Avalanche in late 2007 as a replacement for my 2000 Silverado Extended Cab. I wasn't sold on the the previous years Avalanches, as they appeared to be "cheaply" made. My wife liked the Avalanche and convinced me to give up my practical pick-up for a vehicle that would accomodate our 3 kids, yet still offer the functionality that I required (pick-up bed). I've been more than pleasantly surprised. It rides terrific. I own a contracting business and tow a large boat. The Avalanche hauls and tows large loads with no problem while maintaining considerable interior luxury. I highly recommend the navigation system. Additionally, I recommend the DVD player if you have kids.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Chevy spared no expense in designing the interior of the Avalanche LTZ. It looks and feels like a luxury automobile. The DVD player, camera and reverse sensors are great if you have kids. The camera also make hooking to trailers a snap.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had not planned on getting one at the time, but I am sure glad that I did. LTZ package is awesome (wish I had the Navigation\Backup Camera\DVD package, but no complaints). I've towed a utility trailer, pop-up camper and full- size camper in the Colorado mountains with no problems. Sound system is great, interior is comfortable, engine is powerful, utility aspect is wonderful and, of course, it looks great. Yeah, it uses some gas, but you have to consider that before you buy it. I'm at 19,000 miles right now and I'd buy it all over again.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Bought the Avi in California, drove it in desert with great comfort. Moved to Colorado mountains; with ABS, Stabili- trak, and 4WD on 20" wheels you simply cannot get this vehicle stuck in the Colorado winter! Much better comfort and feeling of safety and security than in my previous 2006 Avi. Fuel economy is very acceptable for the size of the Avi; E-85 delivers almost same mpg as gasoline; plenty of E-85 in Colorado and at about a dollar a gallon less cost that gasoline the cost factor is impressive, even with a slightly lower mpg. Much better in winter in the Rockies than my neighbors Escalade with 2WD.</TEXT>

<TEXT>So far my Av has been a great performer. Looks terrific in Metallic Gray and 20" rims. Locker rear end handles snow, ice and mud very well even in 2WD. Nicest, roomiest rear seats this side of a Ram Megacab. Cargo versatility is ridiculous- stuffed it to the brim with drywall and even rolled out a sleeping bag and spent the night in it when no hotels could be found! The ultimate highway cruiser-like a Cadillac. The fuel consumption readout helps keep your driving style conservative. The blind spots are big but the mirrors provide very good vision and the parking sensors are very accurate, even on something like a skinny pole. I'm very pleased with my Av!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>A great looker-people WILL notice you! The interior is first-rate. Cargo carrying versatility. Decent but not overwhelming power. Cadillac-smooth highway ride. Rear sensors really help backing up.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love my Avalanche. My wife was not sure but she loves every thing about it now. I had a Chevy that would get 35 mpg on the highway but I traded mpg for how I feel after a long trip. To maximize fuel economy it shows when you are in V8 mode or V4 mode and it will show you how much mpg you are getting. By watching my "mode" I can get 21 mpg on the highway or 18 with the E85 fuel. Plus after driving from Iowa to Texas and back again I felt like I drove accross town. I wish I could afford one today for my wife.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased this vehicle needing a truck and also an SUV to haul the family around in. I haven't been disappointed. It is extremely comfortable and the design is sharp inside and out. The locking truck bed is nice to keep luggage and equipment in when you have passengers up front. I'm also an XM guy so having it standard on GM vehicles was a big selling point. Developed a couple of rattles after about a month - the dealership really wasn't interested in helping to fix them so I eventually found and fixed myself.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in 2004 Z71 Tahoe. Test drove 2008 LTZ, but with 0% financing and on- lot availability, bought 2007 LS with the few options we really wanted. Really liked both - ride is great, impressive interior room. Mileage is better than the old Tahoe and better than the 15-20 rating (getting about 17 around town and around 21 highway). And, it looks great. It adjusts great for both my 5'1" wife and my 6'1" frame. Have already used it to haul 8' lumber, 12' trim, and new oak doors - love the mid-gate. Even my Mother (who has always hated trucks as "the good car") has told my Dad that he could buy an Avalanche to replace their Buick next year.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a little over 3000 miles on my LTZ and am really enjoying it. It is one of the most comfortable rides I have owned over the years. Visibility is excellent although changing lanes on the highway and parking do take a little getting used to with this big beast. Definitely splurge on the rear back up camera as I can't imagine parking without it. Fit and finish in the LTZ is great and so far in almost 3 months we have not needed to return to the dealership for anything.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have a loaded '07 LTZ that I traded the intial '02 Z71 for. Loved the first one so much after 5 year and 92K miles, I had to have the new one. There are huge improvements to this GMT900 version in all areas including comfort, accessories, performance, handling, and fuel mileage. The new Active Fuel Mgmt system gives 16.5- 17.0 MPG City and 18.8-20.4 Hwy. It has retained most of the good things the original had with better features. Still too pricey at a $45K list.</TEXT>

<TEXT>We have owned our Avalanche for 1 year, and still are glad we bought it. Fuel mileage has increased, now getting about 21-22 mpg if we keep the speed at or below 75 mph. The 4 cyl mode started kicking in noticeably more once we passed 15,000 miles. Some minor squeaks started in the trim, but tighentened a couple of screws and they have gone away. Only minor problem we have had is with the door handle pulls, metal has started to delaminate from the plastic at the edges, fixed it with super-glue until we can get it into the dealer. It's a cross country machine, 500+ mi on a tank of gas, 1000+ mi a day with minimal driver fatigue. Makes the trip between Reno & LA a breeze.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Drives & rides very well for a vehicle its size. Displacement on demand, 310 hp, 330 lbft torque, 20+ mpg highway. Steering wheel cruise & audio controls big improvement over turn-signal does all.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've only owned this vehicle for a week but I can say that after driving the Nissan Titan and the Chevy Silverado, the Suburban based Avalanche has the best finished interior and best ride of the three vehicles. The 5.3L (327ci) engine feels a bit undersized but the fuel economy is surprising so I have no complaints with performance. It would be nice if the engine would idle in 4 cyl mode to further improve city mileage. A 6 or 7 spd transmission would help bolster acceleration as well as mileage. The column shifter somewhat obscures the sterio controls. Seating is comfortable and the large console storage is a plus. Steering wheel audio control functionality is better than in my Acura-Nice!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Midgate makes the vehicle--it's what I bought it for. Heated leather w/memory, adj pedals, gauge cluster well thought out, info center is very helpful, XM, 20" wheels, ride quality, looks, better mileage than my old 3.5L V6 midsize SUV.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was looking at 07 Silverado crewcabs. I did some research and realized that the new Silverado does not have 4 wheels disc brakes (the 00 did)a nd a long list of stuff that I wanted (XM, steering wheel mounted controls, 5.3V8, alloys, etc) were standard on the Avalanche, but optional on the regular pickups. Additionally, there's no provision on the regular pickup for securing the cargo bed. I bought the Avalanche LT1 with Bose and locking differential, all the stuff I wanted, without a bunch of stuff I couldn't care about. The styling is great and the ride is super comfy. Gas mileage is about what you would expect for a 5500 lb vehicle...about 14-15 in the city, 20- 21 on the road.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Chevrolet has hit upon something pretty special with this truck. It is one great vehicle. It can cruise to formal events and can easily transform into a work truck. The mileage is pretty good considering it is a full size truck/Suburban. I was worried about the switching from 8cyl mode to 4cyl mode on the fly but that works superb and is inditinguisable to the driver.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This truck is truly an awesome and versatile truck. A little soft in the suspension but that can be changed easily. Comfortable to ride in front seats or rear Easily fits 5 tall adults. Beefy and stout when compared to most other full-size trucks on the road. Easy to drive for my wife but yet still enough power for my lead foot. </TEXT>

<TEXT>We ordered our 2007 Avalanche specifically to tow our Outback travel trailer. We equipped it with the optional 6.0L engine, 4.10 rear end, transmission oil cooler, heavy-duty 4L70E transmision and rear-view camera -- in other words, set up to tow. The Avalanche takes to the hills with confidence! 95% of the time, we use it as a comfortable family hauler. The redesigned interior matches our previous Sequoia in comfort and thoughtfulness of design. The drivetrain is not as smooth or refined as the Toyota's, but GM is getting closer. I can feel the 6.0L "burble" at idle, while the Toyota 4.7L was virtually silent. This is my first-ever GM vehicle -- and so far I have been pleased.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The versatility is unbeatable. The Avalanche is perfect for our family with two boys in sports and all the running around that entails. The cargo box serves as a secure and weather-tight trunk for groceries, sports gear, etc. Or, you can pull off the covers, load up the dogs or bikes and just go!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I realize now that all of the reviews I read before purchasing are true. The new Avalanche rides like a luxury car but, it is a lumbering beast. You would never guess that it has 300HP, you really have to step on it to get it to go. Averaging 16 miles/gallon. If you are looking for pep or gas mileage, forget it. If you are looking for luxury and versatility, it is an awesome vehicle. </TEXT>

Window sticker advertises 16 city 21 highway, the best I have acheived is 11.9, dealer now tell me thats normal. Today while driving on a bumpy road at appr.25 mph both side airbags deployed. Not sure how this is going to work out, but I am going to try and go back to a crew cab 1500 Z-71 Chevy truck. I have had 11 repairs with this Avalanche and I have lost faith in it.

It's incredibly versatile. The abiltiy to lock the bed is priceless. Definitely the best truck I've driven and with out a doubt most practical for day to day use. As for gas mileage, though it is kind of a hog the active fuel management makes a huge difference and the instant fuel economy display is a great way to help alter your driving to conserve fuel.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my first domestic vehicle. This truck has wonderful fit and finish, and has appoinments similar to those you mind find in European cars. The power is impressive, though it seems a bit sluggish from a stoplight or in a passing lane. The poor MPG is well documented. I drove it from LA to Monteray (roughly 400 miles) at 75 with the cruise control...and still only averaged 14mpg. All of the luxury features are nice, and made well. Bluetooth is a feature this vehicle is missing, and GM has no real excuse for not equipping it on a $50+ truck.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The 2007 Avalanche LTZ is a wonderful vehicle. Quite, rides beautifully, and the fit and finish are excellent. Towed a 5500lb trailer last hunting season without effort. The options on the LTZ are terrific but it's kind of hard viewing the rear entertainment system from the front seat. The vehicle has 7000 miles and has yet to see the dealership service bay. This is my second vehicle with satellite navigation and the touch screen is easy to use. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The '07 LTZ Avalanche is like driving a luxury car. Very smooth and handles great through the Minnesota blizzards. Very safe. The back seat has lots of leg room. Kids love the wireless DVD player. It is a great looking truck. I try to burn E85 as much as possible. The 8 cylinder to 4 is a joke. It only drops to the 4 when you are going down hill or coasting. My mileage is 14.50 on regular gas and 12.00 on E85. The engineers should look at the competion like Tundra and Rideline, they could build the best of the best. Look at my suggested improvements below and simple things like mudflaps, reciever hitch plug, a business card slot, put a K & N filter in as stock. A quicker engine would be great</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Backup camera, navigtion device, chrome 20"rims, sound system, remote start,3 piece cargo cover works well if you take out the last one for dogs.

<TEXT>I owned a 2002 Avalanche which was flawless and a great vehicle. It is hard to believe that the 2007 is even better in every respect. The heated leather seats now have two stages, seat cushion and seat back. Nice touch. The two tone seats in the Z71 are awesome. The truck negotiates curves very well, no longer as top heavy as the 2002. It seems to hug the road -- no easy feat for such a big vehicle. The seat to steering wheel ratio is now perfect for a 6.4 person. The tailgate is now much lighter and it locks automatically. The 6 changer with MP3 is great as well. The speakers are in the wrong place and do provide a stereo sound when the seat is all the way back. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Outside paint is not bad, exept the plastic grill, paint flaking off. Too much plastic for the sun to bleach on the back. Keeps the "back to black" company afloat with the amount I have to use on it. The inside is nice and plentey of room, but a bit plasticy. Seats are comfortable on a long drive. Sound system is great. It has plenty of power to pull stuff, with and without wheels on it. Motor cuts out over 95mph. Four wheel drive works well although a bit noisy. Nice ride for a truck. I use a 4x4 for what it's built for on rough terrain and in the mountains. So far its doing well but a few more cross land trips will tell. This is my 8th truck in nearly as may years.

<TEXT>We ordered our LTZ with everything we wanted. We love the ride and room. An option we ordered on it is power retractable steps. We thought this would be a neat option to have. Were we wrong! There are no splash guards to fit with the power retractable steps. Which for us since we live in Wyoming means snow, slush, mud etc. is splashed all up on the side of our truck. We contacted Chevy and were basically told "that's the way it and there wasn't anything that can be done about it." When we discussed our dissatifaction with the dealer he tried to sell me $1200 fender flares and the extra paint protection. Beware if you think you want this option on your next Avalanche.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the Z71 4WD package, and was a bit hesitant as to how the ride would be. All my fears are gone, the ride is perfect on/off road. Smooth highway driving, yet just the right amount of stiffness for some moderate off roading. This is the perfect ride for a combination of on highway and moderate off road capabilities. I got the 4.10 gears with the 5.3 engine and find it has plenty of power with nothing in tow. The Z71 2 tone interior with brushed metal trim is definitely a plus. Gas mileage will be 13-15 mph unless you drive a lot of flat freeway. The 8 cyl to 4 cyl switchover is seamless. Light throttle on level or downhill keeps it in 4 cyl mode,gauge shows 4-8 cyl operating status. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I have had this '07 LTZ Avalanche for 3 days now and cannot find any faults. Chevy definitely did it right with this vehicle! The versatility is great, the appointments are beyond what I was shopping for, but I can really get used to these heated seats! The ride is very civilized for a vehicle this big. I definitely love the look without the plastic body cladding from the earlier Av's. If you are contemplating an SUV purchase, you need to do yourself a favor and drive an Avalanche, it just may sway your decision. It did mine!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ride was the thing that sold me on the Avalanche versus a 4 door truck. The LTZ package is awesome. The only option not on this vehicle is the navagation radio/rear camera system.

<TEXT>Been with the dealership for almost a year. I brought home all sorts of vehicles from small Chevy cars to the Colorado pick-up. Came to notice all the sales managers picked the Av for their demo vehicles and got really used to driving one on errands for work. I get to drive Escalades and all sorts of luxury vehicles but it was the Avalanche that made the most sense. It has a true blend of luxury and refinement with a heavy mix of utilitarian comforts. Not sure that I'll ever go back to driving a sedan again!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The 20" wheels and sunroof give the Av a menacing look while also providing a comfortable spot to drive. I got remote start and will be making use of it with the cold weather approaching here in Ontario. Key fob now locks the tailgate - no need to walk around and manually lock anymore!</FAVORITE>

No comparison, the ride was extremely smooth and with included and removable lockable cover, ease of conversion to 8' truck bed as well as Active Fuel Management (idles to 4 cylinders on the highway) - it was a no brainer. Would be nice to have more cab storage, but couldn't have gotten a better buy for the money. Getting 18mpg in town and 20 on the highway. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Thought the automatic tire pressure monitoring was cool, also the radio has built in audio adjustment based on exterior noise to adjust the volume level.

<TEXT>Absolutely love it. Purchased with every option except the power- retractable (BRS) running boards. Used it the first week to haul shelving with 8' particle boards. Interior fit and finish is superb and is really beyond anything Chevy has had to date. Backup camera is a great option. Haven't needed the heated windshield washer yet, but the side mirror defrosters have come in handy. The locking storage wells on the bed sides are a great idea and very pratical. The bed cover is easy to remove and install, suprisingly light and tight fitting. Left the truck out during a steady rain for six hours and no water leaked into the truck bed. Very quiet and smooth on the road.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The midgate feature sold me on this truck. I need an SUV most of the time and a truck only on occasion. It is such a great concept and the 2007 design (interior and exterior) is really a huge quality step forward for Chevy. Backup camera is worth the money.</FAVORITE>

This is the best truck/SUV I have ever owned. I would highly recommend, and have to family and friends.

<TEXT>Went looking at Silverado Classic, but after test drives it was too good to pass up. Much better in every way compared to the Colorado Crew Cab we traded in. Ride was smooth, and quieter at highway speeds. Turning performance and radius is better, with less body lean. Fuel economy is good, averaging 15 city and 20 highway just like the estimates. The interior is well layed out with easy to read guages. The steering wheel audio and cruise controls are excellent features. Visibility is good front and sides, but rear visibility is poor due to the tailgate height, the rear camera would be a nice feature to have. Overall a great move up from the Colorado, wife and I both love this truck!</TEXT>

<TEXT>My friends had an '05 Avalanche and they just loved it. We recently went camping with them with it and found that my wife and I loved it as well. Then we could not wait for the all new '07 Avalanche to come out. We finally got our and we love it even more. The ride and handling, are much better. The build quality both inside and out cannot even be compared with the previous Avalanche. GM did their homework. Love everything about it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ride, horsepower, looks, and good sound system with the Bose.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Really enjoy this vehicle. The car looks stunning. Interior is nice. Fabric picks up lots of "things". Interior needs a little top mount center console like our mini vans. The exterior paint doesn't feel quite as nice as other cars I've owned. The ride is incredible. So smooth. Power is great. Flexiblity is awesome. Easy to convert.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Should have bought a 4dr truck but the ride and handling was what won me over. Acceleration is awesome. Sheet metal fit is excellent but the paint has some dirt and craters. The Active Fuel Management system is a joke, 15 to 17 MPG on highway but will get 20 driving in the 45 MPH range.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Backup sensors and driver info center.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Hadn't even planned to look at Chevy in my quest for a new SUV. Drove by a dealer and figured "what the heck I'll take a quick look". Drove out in a new 2007 Avalanche :-)! Packed with options inside, love the 20" factory rims and new body style outside. Very quiet and smooth ride. Great towing capacity!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>20" factory rims, XM radio, remote start, OnStar, side storage compartments in truck bed.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I had my mind set on a F-150 until my wife conviced me to drive the 2007 Avalanche. This is the most flexible and comfortable truck I have ever driven. It looks great and really "works" like a truck. I highly recommend that you drive it. But be careful, once you do, you will not settle for anything else</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I really enjoy the large navigation display with the rear camera assist. The comfort of the seats is also a plus on any road trip. The active fuel management system is great as well with the gas prices going up.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The new style is tops for GM. I've seen the spy photos of the new Silverados and wasn't blown away. Didn't really want an Avalanche, but found one that had every option but a heated block. Dealer made me a fair deal and I jumped on it. From my '03 Silverado SS, this vehicle glows with class and style.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Love the new look inside and out. Seats are firm but very comfy. Nav system is a fun toy. Finally have a sunroof! And, finally GM has a nice looking 4 door truck!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Got my Avalanche on the 4th of July. Looking to get a deal on a 2006, but looked inside a 2007 and was swayed. I have Ebony leather interior, and it is stunning. The woodgrain dash makes you think you're in the Escalade. It handles suberbly and has good acceleration. The electronics are amazing, and I even got a Verizon line for my in car phone. I have been looking at the Avs for a while, and am glad I waited.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior is fabulous, phone system great,It looks like a classy vehicle, E85 capable a plus, back up sensor</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just picked up and drove 500 miles rountrip to New York. Simply put it was a great ride. Did not miss the '04 Vette convertible for the weekend.. The Active Fuel Management worked. I got better numbers then the other review. However, cruse control is out or it will sit in v8 mode. iPod quality was flawless, sunroof was not noisy. I was also very happy with the build quality. Handling was fine for long windy thin roads from NY-VT-NH. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The active fuel management. After learning not to use cruise (My personal preference or luck) this saved me money. </FAVORITE>
