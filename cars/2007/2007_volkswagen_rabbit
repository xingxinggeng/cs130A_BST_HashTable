<TEXT>I have owned a LOT of cars in my day and this is most definitely at the top of my list. Solid(a very comfortable tank), stable, superb handling with 16-inch tires, 6-speed auto shifts effortlessly and almost imperceptibly, great acceleration, and a genuinely fun driving experience. Fuel economy is in keeping with what the vehicle offers in the way of horsepower and performance. I drive mostly highway and get about 30 mpg with a spirited driving style. As to my ratings, I would be hesitant to give anything a 10, which would mean it was perfect.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Performance, styling that sets it apart from many other cars in its class.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just bought my Rabbit and am OVERJOYED to have it. I went from a Blazer to this car and it meets all the needs I had with better gas mileage and more comfort. I happened upon this car while searching for an SUV. Great price, great quality as expected from VW. My 1st car was VW, and I love the reliability. Good stereo, great handling, I love the rear foldable seats. Great pickup and go, even with the a/c on! Very compassionate about this car! Passed over a 2010 Kia Soul for this car. Very satisfied! Don't pass up this car if you find one... haven't seen many. Heated seat a great plus! :) Very happy with my purchase from SUV to car. Consider it a "crossover". :)</TEXT>

<TEXT> I searched a long time for a vehicle before I chose the Rabbit. I wanted something fun to drive, wasn't a gas guzzler, and foremost a car that I could be comfortable in. Being a rather large individual 6'5" tall and 245 lbs. basically eliminates me from about 90% of the cars in the market, and this includes a lot of trucks and suv's. However, the Rabbit has loads of room. I have more than enough leg room, headroom, and shoulder room. When are the Japanese and American car companies going to get it??? Kudos to VW for building a car that a variety of body types can fit in. I really love this car, it's a blast to drive and I look forward to my daily commute where as before I did not.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE> Height adjustable seat, tilt/telescopic steering wheel, 6 disc CD changer, awesome sound system, blue illuminated gauges, abundant safety features, torquey and peppy inline 5 cyl. engine, classy interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>In general, I'm pretty happy with this car. I had a problem with a rattle at the top of the dash, but the dealership fixed it without charge. Quite a bit of tire noise-probably the 17" wheels. The door mirrors are quite small so you have to adjust them perfectly-used to hate this but not anymore. No reliability issues at all. Handling is very solid-buckled down generally, but a bump in a turn will upset the chassis. Great safety with all the airbags and traction/stability. The cabin feels very open with high roofline-very nice visibility. Comfortable even for the long haul. Generally a joy to drive. At this price point the Rabbit can't be beat. Would like power/DSG/handling of a GTI though</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ergonomics are top notch. The layout of the controls is very intuitive. Feels very solid - both handling and build wise. Has a lot of storage room - fold down the back seats and be amazed. Nice to be able to shift semi-manually to get best performance and mileage. Aux jack is amazing...love it!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>As a 6' 4" enthusiast, my requirements are elbow room and fun to drive. This car fills the bill! I have had several VWs,and many others in the compact class since 1955, and this 2007 2.5 is the best overall! Solid and secure at ANY SPEED. By far the best overall combination of features and useful sophistication per dollar. This car is better than the maker says it is. Brakes and handling as delivered are outstanding, the engine and driveline give performance well ahead of its price class. If this 2.5 were available with the 6-speed manual, it would be a best buy by far! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Ergonomics and ride quality are in a very high class all by themselves. Build quality is totally above reproach! The flat torque curve and good gear ratios get this car going with no fuss.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I do not know why this people are saying bad thinks about this car!!! i was reading the reviews and ohh man.. i have never seen anything like that on my car. Good Performance, the Torque is great for this car. It handles pretty good. not problems with this car at all. Also, the oil change, you can do it in several places, like Goodyear, good people, good price for a synthetic oil. the brakes are really good, it could be better, but i cant complain. even i have driven my Stock Rabbit into a track race and it performs really good in corners. If you really take care of your car, and drive it responsible, you will receive response back from it!!! Love it! </TEXT>

I find the 6 speed automatic quite smooth. No problems with brakes, bass flare, weird electronics or any of the stuff I read here. I have a 48 inch rack and put 4 kayaks on it! What a car!</TEXT>

Electric Windows seem to have a mind of their own. Then the wipers, lets just say I had to change the motor. Now I have a epc starting problems... That no one seems to be able to figure it out.

<TEXT>I have had my Rabbit for 2 years and have loved driving it. The problem with this car is that, when something happens to it (or even when you need an oil change), you'll be put in the poor house. Beware, the Rabbit is very high-maintenance and pricey once off-the-lot. I was lightly rear-ended, small dent: $900. I drove a dirt road leading to a mountain hiking trail and hit a bump, transmission needs to be replaced: $7000. Even an oil change: $90. I will be saving the $7000 needed to put in a new transmission and choosing a reliable, low-maintenance Japanese car, like I had before.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I tried to find a better deal on a hatchback used and domestic (even went to car auctions). This two door appears to have more room than the four door Focus. What sold me was the vast range of features and powertrain. It is a huge improvement from the Mark IV Golf with its four wheel independent, five cylinder, and a very smooth shifting six speed Tiptronic transmission for only $17,000! The plastics on the exterior protect exactly where the car would get bumped in parking lots. Plus it has traction control, heated mirrors, ABS, cruise control, six airbags, laser wielded frame, and daytime running lights...the list goes on. I would love to sell these for a living.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>It even has orientation lighting that gives you that "dark room" ambiance. Six speed automatic sport mode is a lot of fun. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the Rabbit a week ago, and am enjoying the well-designed interior and great drive very much. I find the car very well-named as it feels very much like a quick and nimble little rabbit. My only caution is the engine noise, and I feel the 2.5 to be quite thrashy-rattling around 2,000-2,500 RPM under acceleration. I am sincerely hoping that this is not due to a developing engine problem. Time will tell and I will update periodically. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The wonderful VW interior and German fit- finish. This car truly is finished like a price class beyond. The 6-speed auto and great stereo are my other favorite features. Its handling is near top of the list too. I really am enjoying this little guy. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I am one of those uncommon Americans that loves hatchbacks! I love the engine they put in these cars as well. It is very speedy, smooth and quiet. It has a nice interior, beautiful paint (United Gray in my case), and it is overall practical and classy. Nothing seems garish or cheesy about this car. I decided on the Rabbit over a Mini Cooper. I seriously inquired and test drove both cars. The Cooper was cool, but the engine lacked, and the styling struck me as over the top (semi-tacky). I also felt cramped and bit frightened for my safety. Traded in my 2005 Jetta. I get 25-30 mpg mostly highway driving. To me that is fairly decent, especially since the car is a 5 cylinder 2.5L. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very impressed with the pick up of the 2.5L Rabbit. This is also matched with a great feel of the road and the perfect amount of engine noise. It handles great and the seats are nice and snug to your body. The interior has a better fit and finish then a lot of the high end lines out there. Detail is key for me - they even put little VW logo's on the headlight assembly.</TEXT>

<TEXT>After three months of driving my 5-speed, two door Rabbit I was in love with it. That is until last week when someone t-boned me at about 60 miles an hour. After the car spun 360 degrees, I got out and walked away. I work at a personal injury law firm and have seen plenty of similar accidents where people have permanent injuries, and all I ended up with was seatbelt burn. For the money, you can't get a better quality or safer car. I can guarantee when I get my settlement check from the insurance company I'll be buying myself another Rabbit.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I like it so far. I've only had it for a few weeks. It doesn't get the gas mileage stated but I was also told that it would take a few thousand miles for the engine to break in and then I would get the good gas mileage. It's getting about 23-24 mpg and I drive mostly around town. I noted some of my dislikes below but for the most part VW really did it right and most of it is all standard. That is what I love most is that all the "extra" features are already standard on this vehicle!! I show mine off to friends and they all ask how much this or that cost me extra and I say "Nothing!"</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>My wife loves the heated seats. I love the 6 Disc CD changer and the red lights that glow just enough from over head to allow you to see the interior at night without it being a distraction. I also love the color of the stereo, dash and interior lights and the Tiptronic Auto Shift control.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>After searching for a low priced second car I couldn't have been more pleased with my selection. The Rabbit is a powerful, well equipped, and fun to drive vehicle. The commute to work is somewhat enjoyable while zipping through traffic in my sporty new VW. After driving a Hyundai Accent, Ford Focus, Honda Civic, and a Scion xA, I drove the Rabbit. Needless to say this car outperformed them all and had all the safety and convenience features included in the price. The Civic and the Hyundai had a/c available for an extra $900, what a deal! I'm happy with my purchase and I feel safe driving my two young children in this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The key is neat. It is so fun to flip it open and closed. The automatic transmission with the Tiptronic and sport settings makes driving fun. I also like the blue lights on the instrument panel. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I fell in love with the Rabbit when I first saw it, and probably bought it too quickly (especially with the great trade-in offer and the deal I got). After about 3,500 miles, I decided the car wasn't for me. I lost about $2,500 on the car but bought a fantastic 2004 Saab 9-3 lightly used for roughly the same price (what Rabbits are retailing for). I just didn't enjoy the ride, everything "makes sense," and on paper the Rabbit is a technical marvel, but it's also not very fun to drive. Also, the gas mileage leaves A LOT to be desired. My new car gets 35 miles to the gallon on the highway and is faster, while the rabbit averaged 27 mpg on a 1,500 mile all-highway trip.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am very impressed by this vehicle's performance capabilities. It picks up quick when you need the power. It was between the Matrix and the Rabbit. Both were similarly priced, but the Rabbit came in a bit less expensive and it is more fun to drive. This is my second Golf (Rabbit). My first Golf was purchased new in 1987. I had that car for over ten years. I finally sold it to a friend. We are still friends, haha.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For $15,000 how can you go wrong? I sell cars and I learn a lot in the business when it comes down to the fit and finish of a car. Besides the Honda Fit, this is the best bang for your buck. The power is untouched by any of the competition. Most cars in this segment have 110 HP. When it comes down to the interior quality build, you have a car with high quality material and of course a lot of features you would have to pay more for in other cars. This is the best $15,000 brand new car you can have. The only downside is the gas mileage, but who really cars when you compare the fun factor of a 150 hp car to a 110 hp car. Get one.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Going from a 2003 Jetta 1.8T with 180 hp, my new Rabbit is a bit of a change. The peppiness isn't as much as my previous Turbo Jetta and the tires are not very smooth. Its ride is a bit noisy with the 5-cyl engine. Other then that, it isn't too bad for the price. It is better than a Japanese vehicle, despite what they always say about reliability. The Rabbit has it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The blue dashboard lights. The hatchback with the VW logo as the actual handle to open the hatch is a super cool idea. The radio memory buttons where you save your radio stations actually shows you what station is saved, which is fantastic. One less thing for me to remember.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have had my '07 Rabbit for over a month now and it's been great. I test drove many cars in this segment such as the Mazda3, Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic, and Hyundai Elantra just to name a few. The rabbit was by far the best value as far as safety and standard features for the money are concerned. This is a car that I actually look forward to driving. It feels and drives like I spent twice as much as I did. It feels like a BMW 3-Series at half the cost. This is my first German car and I am very impressed. This really is a driver's car. It's a very well built, solid, fun to drive car with every safety feature in the book and a great warranty to match. What more can you ask for? I think VW has begun to turn things around with Rabbit.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded a Dodge Ram 4x4 for this Sage Green Rabbit. The other cars in my house are the 325xi and 525i. This is no BMW, but it is one heckuva fun way to get 30 mpg and decent urban transportation. It has tons of room for 6' 2" me and even my 6' kid in the backseat. My first fill up was 28 mpg and that's with an automatic. It is a little noisy on the highway, but it's a $16,000 car, not a $40,000 BMW.

<TEXT>Civic? Mazda3? Rabbit? I too looked at each, but in the end the Rabbit was simply better. Feel the solid laser-welded construction of the Rabbit over a rough road. No goofy-fad interior either, clean, functional design with everything in clear view and reach. The most underrated: the engine. Some say 2.5L should have more horsepower, but then they haven't felt the Rabbit's torque. It pulls strong without winding revs. The 2.5L engine allows torque on tap and makes the driving experience something the others can't touch. Who wants to rev to 7,000 every time you want to pass? Not the people driving Rabbits! Oh, about the weight, yes its a little high but check out the crash test ratings. More metal is safer!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The safety, optional rear thorax bags, fold down passenger seat, laser welded unibody, shifter feel, 5-cyl. sound, and the interior at night, Wow! I also love the low road noise, traction control, rear passenger air vents, adjustable armrest, full size spare, and the slot for the owner's manual in the glove box.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I used to drive a Suzuki Forenza. Don't get me wrong, that was a nice car but there was no aftermarket parts and no horsepower or performance in that car at all. The new Rabbit beats out any car you can find for the price. With the new engine being in the Jetta also you can find all kinds of parts for it. VW makes a number of cosmetic parts which lets you make your car unique. There are a lot of cars out there now days that say they get incredible gas mileage. I have driven those cars and I am not going to pay up to $10,000 more for a lot less of a car. This car get great gas mileage. I am very pleased with what VW has done.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>All the "standard" options that would cost you thousands more in upgrade packages in other cars. For example, the 6 airbags, LED interior lights, a full size spare tire, blinker lights on the mirrors, outside temperature display, telescoping steering wheel, MP3, 10 speaker stereo, the speed and performance, and many more.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I remember the earlier GTI Rabbit and dreamed of it's return. I went from an '02 Golf GLS to an '05 Jetta GLS (prior to march '05) waiting for more horsepower at an affordable price. I was able to opt out of my current lease and purchase the 2007 Rabbit. The car handles like a dream. It pounces on command, zips when needed and delivers a smooth transition into cruise control, an upgrade in my eyes.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a '01 Audi A4 for my '07 5-door Rabbit. I loved my A4, but I love the Rabbit more. The only feature missing from my Audi is the Homelink and auto-dim mirrors. Everything else is just as good or better. This was definitely not a step down. Everything about this car is just right and the value is unbeatable. It's quick, fast, and super comfortable. You're not likely to come across many others out on the roads, so it's cool to be driving a unique car. I agree with the poster that said if they made this any nicer, it would be an Audi. I thought I might regret not getting the GTI, but I definitely do not. While I love the 2.0T, this 2.5 is a fantastic engine.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I just bought my first new car at 45 years of age yesterday, a 4-door '07 Rabbit, fully loaded with new alloys to boot. It has 153 miles on it, so I am in the honeymoon phase for sure. After looking carefully around, I decided the Rabbit was the best value around for about $20,000. It is quiet, peppy, and tight as a drum, with a fab interior -- which is so much nicer than a Japanese interior it is a little hard to believe the price is comparable. My Dad had a '77 Champagne Edition Rabbit when I was in HS, and it was also tight and fast. He was horrible at maintenance, and got 220,000 out of it.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Wow, where to start? The windshield has superb visibility. The interior is incredible for a car of this price - no fuzzy seats here! The urban cockpit is over the top (but I like it) with more lights than a 747 at night. The sound system is awesome, and there is plenty of leg room in the back.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I looked at a few different vehicles like the Mazda3, Honda Fit, and Nissan Versa...and none of them fit like the Bunny does for me. The moment I laid eyes on it, I was in love. The car drives great, feels great inside, and is just all around fun to drive. Now that I've had it a month, there are a few things I've noticed. Its gas mileage has been 20 / 25 mpg, it has some odd noises here and there from the pedals, and the stereo seems like it is possessed at times. Other than that, it is packed with a lot of things that I wouldn't have expected for the price. And I get a guitar...what could be better?</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The ten speakers, tilt/telescopic steering wheel, heated side mirrors and seats, aux input, sun/moonroof, spacious interior, full size spare, blue lit instrument panel, how all four windows are automatic, the front armrest, the two ac power inputs, up/down + key engaged closing... and the key itself is awesome.</FAVORITE>

I love it's looks, refined interior, long list of standard features, performance, ride, fit & finish and how it is so quiet. It has everything I'd want in a car at a very reasonable price. It is a small economical car with NO compromises.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I traded in a 2000 Golf for my new Rabbit, and although I technically "downsized" since I went from a "fully-loaded" Golf GLS to a "base-model" Rabbit, I do not feel like I am missing anything (except the sunroof, but oh well). The standard features on the Rabbit are great. I got the added ESP system and the 16" alloy wheels, but the features built in are awesome. The dash is redesigned and great, the passenger room is much more spacious, although the truck lost some space, but thats cool. The brushed chrome also looks awesome on black. Thanks to VW for bringing back the black on black interior. I was scared that I would end up with that stupid back on beige. Go buy yourself one :)</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Volkswagen Rabbit is wonderful. It has such a solid feel to it, you won't be able to find a more solid feeling car in it's price range or even a bit above. The gas mileage may not be amazing in this class, but most other cars on this class don't have five cylinders either. I wish the redline was higher but other than that power is fine. This car is very peppy, if it was any lighter it would be too fast! It has great interior ergonomics and quality materials are used throughout. It is better than my '06 Civic. It is not as futuristic, but the build quality actually feels nicer. It has nice handling, not too harsh and sporty but no wimp either. It is very pleasant, fun, and a great buy plus it comes with a great warranty. I love my Rabbit!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The classic VW gauges in red and blue. This car has the best interior of any car in its class and pretty much beats any American or Korean car that costs thousands more, and is on par with if not exceeding Japanese brands like Honda and Mazda. It has a very refined look, nice handling, good torque, and a very quiet interior.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I previously had a 2002 VW GTI and loved the car. The only reason that I didn't go with the GTI but with the Rabbit is because there is no 4-door on the GTI (I know they have it in Europe). In my opinion it is the best car in its class. It looks great, feels solid, drives sporty, has a roomy and classy interior.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love this car's 170lb.ft torque, 150HP 5cyl engine, 6-speed auto transmission with manual mode, 10 speaker / 6 CD sound system with Sirius radio, sporty seats, and how all four windows have auto up/down.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I've had this car for about a month and so far I'm thrilled with my purchase. Everyone notices this car and asks me what it is. I am not very tall, but the Rabbit has great visibility. VW rates the fuel efficiency as 22 city/30 hwy, but I've been getting around 24-26 city mpg. I'm very pleased with the acceleration of the inline 5-cyl. engine, yet it still has decent fuel efficiency. It is roomier than expected and has a lot of cool creature comforts. This car has a lot of bang for the buck. All the safety features are STANDARD, while other cars I tested had extra charges for side airbags and ABS and traction control. This car had the most features for the best price. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Being short, the telescoping steering wheel is great. I don't have to be afraid to have my face smashed or my ribs shattered by a deployed airbag because I can set the steering wheel at the correct distance. The 6-way adjustable seat is comfy. I can't wait to get the adapter to play my MP3s! </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Three weeks and two tanks of gas later I can say I have loved every minute in this car (especially at night ... you'll see). Although I do have to say it's been a real challenge driving moderately to break in the engine. Three weeks without redlining or driving full-throttle is absolute torture in this car. You can get up to 50 mph in second gear (and it's hard to keep it under that speed). I'm happy to report that the car's gas mileage is better than expected. The first tank of vigorous city driving achieved 24.7 mpg. The second tank I drove moderately (which equals somewhat aggressive driving to me), about 30% / 70% city / hwy driving. I achieved 30.3 mpg. This car has solid handling, performance, and a reasonable price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The exterior styling is more refined than the previous model Golf. And the interior is a class above the Honda Civic. This car is made from sturdy, modern materials like you'd find in a BMW or Mercedes. All of its buttons are intuitively placed. The speedometer / tach displays are very sporty and refined, not gimmicky. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is absolutely great. I bought it last week, and I have just crossed over 100 miles. I have a manual tranny, and it is simply a blast. to drive I can't wait for the break-in period to end. The stereo is loud with the stock ten speakers (the Honda Civic I drove had six, and it's not even close). This vehicle comes with every safety feature you could want, and it is the base model. I would suggest getting rims. Mine came with 16 inch rims, and it just gives the car a better finish. This is my first new car. Anyone considering it against a Honda, Toyota, or Nissan needs to know the choice isn't even close. VW's feel more finished and polished. They are also much more fun to drive.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the amount of room in the car. I am 6' and all my friends are too. The front passenger seat has almost too much room, which gives us plenty of room in the back seat. I also love the stereo and how quick this car is. The 2.5 five banger does not dissapoint.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Rabbit is an oustanding vehicle that is built solidly. It has great engine performance, a suspension that absorbs most road bumps, and it glides on the highway at high speeds. You get many standard features that are optional in most cars at this price. The hatchback is very versatile and spacious. I negotiated the price down to $16,000 with auto trans only. Consumer Reports' bottom line price was $15,760, so use that as a reference. Its power steering is something else, its turning radius perfect. The gas mileage could be better, but with the engine they have included that is shared with the Jetta and Passat, it might worth the extra money spent on gas. The 6-speed transmission automaticly shifts smoothly. I highly recommend this car.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The speed adjusted wipers, lane change feature, Triptronic shifting, A/C cooled glove box, hatchback handle in the VW logo, CD player with 175 watt stereo, MP3 input jack in the glove box, 6 airbags, and the overall engine performance.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought a base manual 2007 Rabbit and was surprised at how much equipment comes standard. It has power locks/windows and an MP3 player for example. To get that in a Civic I would have paid at least $3,000 more. Of course, with VW if all that still works in seven years I'll be stunned. They definitely used some cheap plastics in the interior. I've eyed three things that will surely be broken before the warranty is up. The poor quality history not withstanding, a great car for the money, mainly because the performance is fantastic. It is just plain fun to drive. If I wasn't so scared of the quality issues and notorious electrical problems I would have opted for the Tiptronic auto that I test drove - that thing rocked!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like how the Rabbit has 150 hp in sich a tiny car. Its handling is fantastic. Its styling is great for a compact car, too.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I was excited to own my first very own car a few months ago when I bought a Scion xA in automatic. After being rear ended and having the car declared totaled, I ended up buying the Rabbit in manual 2 door paying about a grand more than I did for my xA. I think this car drives and feels much more luxrious and upscale to the xA and '01 Civic LX of my past. Though it is harder when trying to fit people in the back only having 2 doors, Then have plenty of room back there. I am one who likes buying cars from manufacturers who builds cars in their country as my xA was made in Japan (Toyota). The Rabbits are currently made in Wolfsberg, Germany. I am sincerely impressed with my purchase.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior lighting at night is a pleasure. The blue and red is slick, clean, and easy to read. The seats feel a lot more comfortable than those of my past cars as well. There are lots of "Easter Eggs" such as nice turn signal blinker functions, windshield wiper goodies, and others...</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>My only complaint really is that they seem to feel drivers of the 4 door model should be more comfortable than those of the 2 door model. The seat in the two door Rabbit is not as adjustable and it is missing the front middle arm rest. Otherwise, I love the car. I have had it for four weeks now and already need to get it in for it's 5,000 mile check-up! Oh and of course the dealership had no clue (anyone) about the stereo input.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I had been waiting for VW to launch this NEW GOLF V for the past three years. I researched the car for a very long time. Being built in Germany at the Wolfsburg plant, she really is a IMPORT! I have the 4dr auto with Tiptronic, and I LOVE IT. Now that it has arrived it has been dubbed the Rabbit! Even better, the legendary car IS BACK! And with this car, the legacy lives on. The look, the feel, this car has it all. VW has hit a big home run with the new Rabbit. The 4-door version has LOTS of room. When people get inside they just look around puzzled that though small on the outside, it is very vast on the inside! The Tiptronic 6-speed transmission is fun, fun, fun! The new 150 hp engine also kicks hard. Don't let this 'lil car fool ya. Hop, Hop.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the a/c cooled glove box, I don't know why, but I like it. Also, the 6-speed Tiptronic gearbox...let's you do QUICK work on ANY time consuming errands! I like the optional SPORT mode in the transmission. The key rolls ALL four windows up/down from outside the vehicle! The vehicle lives up to the old RABBIT nameplate very well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have over 3000 kms. on it and love it more every day. This is my 6th car (4th VW) and is my favorite by far. I love the handling, acceleration, looks, interior, and especially how quiet it is. It has tons of room inside and I really like how everything is laid out inside. I actually like the cruise on the stick and it is very easy to use (unlike previous Jetta models). It makes for a cleaner looking steering wheel. I have had absolutely no problems so far. It is built like a tank.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the first VW I have owned and my previous car was a '91 Honda Accord. I love the preformance of the 2.5L engine paired with the manual transmission. The interior is deceptively roomy to me (6'2"). The quality of construction is the best that I have seen from all of the car companies I have shopped (Dodge, Chevy, Honda, Toyota). This car is by far exceptional in quality, options, and preformance for the price.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I love the number of options that come standard. It is amazing compared to the standard options that are offered by other car companies. The base VW Rabbit model comes with more features than what Honda Civics come with when "well equipt."</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have only owned my Rabbit for a couple of weeks, but already know I will not regret the purchase. It is sensible for an in-city driver like me (3-5 miles/day most days). You get a lot of car for a little price, without throwing the extra $6,000 down for the GTI version. This car is very stylish and remarkably roomy inside (my parents are jealous--they have a new Beetle). Plus, unlike a lot of the 2-door Hatchbacks coming out (the Yaris at $11,000--ha--only if you barely have air-conditioning), the Rabbit comes pretty loaded at the base package. It has power everything, cruise control, etc. I am looking forward to the accessories packages to outfit the base model (be warned: floor mats are not standard, for some reason).</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The engine, tossing a 2.5 liter into this little thing gives it plenty of get- up-and-go, even without any Turbo mods (though I might get those anyway...).</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>At first I didn't know if I liked the new Rabbit, then I went on a test drive in one. I never thought that the 5-cylinder engine would have that much pep to it. They also did the trick with having a lot of features in the standard base priced model. Not only is the car affordable, it gives you more than you money's worth in fuel economy and the options. I love my new Rabbit.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like how they have LED lights shining down on the gear selector (5- speed), the light his the chrome trim and makes it stand out like none other. I am also a big fan of the blue on red instrument panel.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I just purchased a 2007 Rabbit 2.5 5-door on 8-5-06. I went to a great dealer with great salespeople. This is our fifth VW. This car's fit and finish are superior. I am impressed with its numerous safety features - see IIHS for crash test results. Its 5-speed manual transmission is smooth and slick. Its handling is awesome - it really hugs the roads. Its accelleration very pleasing as well - especially with the 5-speed. The interior materials are first class. The rear seat leg room comfy for a 6-footer. Its cargo area spacious. I use this vehicle to drive to work - 40 miles round-trip. So far it is averaging about 28/29 mpg mix city/hwy. This is one well-built-fun to drive-good looking automobile. Hats off to VW.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The accelleration, 5-speed manual transmission, fit and finish, nice interior materials and room, handling, safety features, good dealer experience, hatchback versitility, fun to drive character, price and warranty.

<TEXT>Like most VW's the handling and feel is great. It is a heavy car with a large 5cyl engine. It is a loud engine and the Transmission is not properly tuned for the engine. We had the premium sound system that had the base flare problem...i found a service bulletin on the internet and contacted the dealership and they fixed it under the warranty. The transmission does not downshift until it is almost at a stop. So when the car is going 30mph its still in 5th or 6th gear. And it starts sputtering a bit. Also the tiptronic manual shift has a loss of RPM for a moment in second gear after the shift. And we are noticing a slip and clunk shifting move. I think VW will find a problem soon.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The first week I got the car, it was in the shop 2 times. The radio never worked, widows always dysfunctional. The brakes were going to kill me. AC never got cold. The hatch back broke 2 times. No one can change the oil but the dealership. The back brakes wore out before 30k miles. Things randomly broke in the car. For example, the sun glass holder broke, I forgot it was there until it fell down. It was INSANE! VW kept telling me that I did not know how to use their "special" brakes. I almost got into 2 accidents because my car decided to drive off the road during braking. In the End, VW stormed out of the court room and I am buying a Honda.

<TEXT>Today I took my car to have a rear braking noise checked at the dealer where I bought it. I knew the problem was with the rear brakes but I didn't figure it to be worn out brake pads and worn metal to metal with less than 20k miles. The front brake pads hardly show any wear at all and now I must spent over $300.00 to fix the problem. Dealer service says that rear brakes wear out twice as fast as the front brakes on this model. I've always known the front to rear wear ratio to be the opposite and more like 3 front repairs for every rear repair. Front brakes handle about 70% of the stopping for most vehicles and are therefore always thicker. I've had other cars so why the quick wear out?</TEXT>

Overall my experience with this car has been good, but a few build quality issues have arisen. The sheet metal seems to ding easily, I tend to park carefully but have received a disproportionate number of dings in the past year. Rattle started coming from the center HVAC stack at about 8k miles, dealer fixed. The plug for the spare tire compartment came loose and I had standing water , but luckily no rust, dealer replaced. Rear windshield sprayer is cheap, popped off once, dealer replaced. Routine service is EXPENSIVE (syn oil), and difficult to do yourself.</TEXT>

Bought the Rabbit over the GTI since it doesn't need premium fuel like the turbo charged 2.0 motors. The interior space is excellent and really like the positioning of controls.

<TEXT>At my first oil change I complained that the shift lever was violently shaking in 4th gear, so VW replaced the shift assembly. Things went well for a few months and then the shaking came back. I brought it back to the dealer for the 10k checkup and told them the shaking was back. To my amazement they told me they had to rebuild my transmission!! This should never happen with a manual gear box, especially one with 9500 miles on it. But it doesn't stop there. Today the automatic up/down feature for the windows stopped working. I've owned the car for a year and put 9500 miles on it and it has been in the shop for over 4 weeks in one year...not a good ratio if you asked me. </TEXT>

Ride is very comfortable. I could ride cross country and not feel stiff. The performance is just right and I feel like I'm in a tank with its safety features. I plan on starting a family soon and I think the rabbit is our new baby carrier. :-) Fuel Economy isn't so wonderful(a 150 hp car should get at least 30-32 mpg not just 25 mpg). I'm also getting some rattle right at the air vent above the radio on the dash and by the driver's side rear speaker. </TEXT>

Great tuner car for those small little quirks, i.e. braking, body roll.

<TEXT>This is my 7th VW since I started driving. My Rabbit is fun to drive and so far has been very reliable.Gas mileage isn't as good as my 96 but the power is much better. Handles very well and is powerful enough to get me out of the way of large trucks and SUVs. Would highly recommend this car. </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>will not buy another</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have posted when I first bought this car. Mostly all positive. Still a good car, but I will not buy another. I drive hard (80 to 85 mph) on the highway as my commute is 70 miles round trip to work. My mileage is average 28 mpg which is ok. Things that disappoint me.. 1-a/c in glovebox, but no light. 2-can not open drivers door and lock from inside (without key). 3-can not sit in the dark with only radio lights on. All lights including bright driving lights will be on. 4-hatch lock locks on its own free will (when your not ready) 5-outlet and mp3 jack in glovebox (useless location) 6-no quick release to let seat down. The twist knob is poor choice, as I like to lean back. 7-expensive maintenance.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Quick, agile. This car gets up goes at any speed even at 75 mph. Cruise control is perfect (I gave this a negative in my first review). Nice interior lighting. Beautiful exterior lines. 8 airbags. Good sounding stereo.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>For some reason (maybe reading a lot of hype) I was focused on the Mazda3. Well, forget about it! My 2007 Rabbit 2dr. is superior in EVERY way, except gas mileage. That's fine with me. Do not buy any Mazda3 until you drive the comparable Rabbit, now made in Germany. Compared to everything else in its class, the Rabbit sets the standard, no matter what you read or hear elsewhere. It is a great car for those of us who enjoy driving.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought an '07 4-door right off the showroom floor, black with the 17" V-Vision wheels (I was hooked). This is my third VW, and the other two ('78 Rabbit, '88 Fox) were bulletproof. I compared the Mazda3, and the Rabbit offers far more features, refinement, and power (the 2.5L has terrific torque) for the money. Since October 2006, I've put 20,000 miles on it (18,000 miles in the first year). It feels like a budget Audi. What sinks it are the rattles (see Suggested Improvements). I've had it to the dealer once; whatever they did only muted the rattles a little bit for a little while. No new car should rattle this much. I've had numerous Fords (no paragons of quality) that were far quieter.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Automatic Sport mode (use it daily); high-calibar interior materials; soothing blue & red dash lighting; one- touch up & down on all 4 windows; sunroof; heated seats (great feature in this price class & warm up quickly!); integrated hatch release/VW logo (clever design); large door pockets</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought one of these for my wife a year ago and we are getting rid of it with under 17,000 miles on it. We are still upside down in the vehicle, and it is spending more time at the dealership than at our house. And for some reason the dealership is putting around 200 miles on it while trying to fix a problem with the idling. The vehicle has been a problem since the month after we got it and our dealership seems to be making little if no effort to fix the problem.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Initially, I was drawn to the Rabbit coupe's styling, but its performance has been what's impressed me most since leasing it. In 'Drive' mode, it's gutsy, in a small car kind of way, but in 'Sport' mode, it's a different car! I've had cars with 'Sport' modes before and have noticed little difference. When I put the Rabbit in 'Sport' mode, its performance is similar to the Honda S2000 I used to drive, with better low end torque than the S2000. I have kept up with Porsches off the line in 'Sport' mode, granted they could roast the Rabbit over the long haul, but the point was to see if the Rabbit was a gamer. It is up for any challenge. Good, and powerful, things come in small packages!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Obviously, 'Sport' and shiftable mode, lane change turn signal, iPod adapter and center arm rest, the gauge and control lights, the VW emblem hatchback lock is clever, and finally, the very best feature, its low price and low lease payments for a bunch of driving fun!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Highs: torquey engine, great interior design, amazing spec list standard, cost of ownership is very low. Gas mileage is pretty poor, but if you're concerned about gas mileage you're probably not even going to be considering this car anyway. The 170 ft-lbs of torque is apparent from very low in the rev range, and worth the trade with gas mileage as far as I'm concerned. When compared to everything else $20k or less, the Rabbit shines through.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This review is an update from my initial review 2/1/07. I now have 14,000 miles on the car and still like it. I was concerned about engine noise at first, but this seemed to lessen with the break-in. I like the growl! A few issues: on a couple occasions I've stalled after being in my heated office garage and then driving 5 mins in 40-50 degree temp. outside - stalled 2dif. times - exact same location each time. I have a rattle in the right vent. The driver's side window switches are peeling but dealer is replacing. My upper strut towers/bearing were replaced proactively by my dealer after I mentioned a slight steering noise - this fixed it. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The gas mileage seems great (I average 37-40 mph highway), get up and go is great, love how it handles in rain and snow (with the exception of the wipers pushing water back onto the windshield). If it does rain, you must keep your windows closed or it pours inside. Within 6 months I began having problems with the front end - always seemed like something was rubbing and steering was not as tight. Well after 5 trips to the dealer they replaced the strut mounts, worked for about 2 weeks. After two more trips to the dealer, they are basically replacing the front end - not a good sign after one year.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've had the Rabbit for 1600 miles and have enjoyed the drive. The fit of the car is good. The perfomance is great. The comfort is good. The 2.5 with the auto is a fantastic match. I have had plenty of go when needed. You have to watch your speed til you get used to the ride at speed (you'll be doing 80 before you realize it). The Rabbit's handling is very responsive with good road feel. When the weather is bad there is no problem either. The sound system is very good and easy to set up. I'm 6'2 and 250 and fit in the seats comfortably. The car has more room than you think. All in all I have enjoyed this car a lot and find myself smiling when driving. Drive it and compare.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I have driven many cars in my 50 years; my Rabbit tops them all! Zip, zip, zippedy zip, in and out of parking spaces, in and out of traffic in a jiffy. Rabbit loves curves. One day I will get a traffic ticket for speeding, since Rabbit does not want to go slow or follow anyone and I just can't control it. Maybe Cesar Millan can help make it calm and assertive, not mildly aggressive :)</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Touch turnsignal feature: you touch the turn signal arm once and the turn signal will blink for you three times.

<TEXT>I test drove other cars in the same class (Corolla, Civic, etc.). Boy, are those cars "Mom and Pop" compared to the Rabbit! Let's start with the car's performance - it is simply hard to drive this car "normally", especially with the shiftable auto trans and Sport Mode! If I drive it fast and hard, gas mileage stays to the low end of what the sticker says (22), no big deal. If I drive "normally", I get 25 city/30 hwy MPG consistently. The car is incredibly fun to drive and has tight build quality. This is my second VW (Passat previously). Very happy with the car.</TEXT>

Overall, I feel this is a very well-designed and well-engineered car with some quirks, endearing and otherwise. I think it's style, performance and overall charming character more than make up for its few, unfortunate, shortcomings. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The car is full of features that suggest real thought went into its design. The lane-changer signal, a/c diffuser vent and auto-opening windows are welcome features in this class.

<TEXT>This is my second VW. Now after I sold my first Golf I missed that car for over 5 years so it was apparent that i would buy another VW when I could. The car rides and handles great but my buddy gets better fuel mileage in his 2002 Toyota 4Runner. My Rabbit has stalled 9 times since ownership after a cold start in the middle of a busy highway, tell me that's safe. VW says that it's not throwing any codes and it seems to be working fine. Oh yeah it also has an automatic transmission, go figure. Yesterday I test drove a Nissan Versa which had more interior space but 28 less horsepower which I didn't even notice and better gas mileage. Just stay away from this car.</TEXT>

<TEXT>First of all, let me start by saying how much I love this car! People have complained about fuel economy, but you have to realize it is a 5 cylinder engine! It is right in line with other 5s. Just look at the Volvo 5cyl and you find the same gas mpg rating! If you're coming from an SUV you're likely to love the mpg, but if not, you'll be somewhat disappointed, but you get the extra cylinder and it makes a big difference! There is nothing really bad about this car other than you will want to drive it fast which may cause you grief! It does seem to get a lot of attention and impresses everyone who sits in it! It's a step up in class from Honda! </TEXT>

<TEXT>I got my Rabbit a few months ago and absolutely LOVE it! My family has always driven Volkswagens and I'm no exception. It has great torque, super spacious insides for a two door, and it ultra sleek in design on the outside as well as in. My boyfriend is 6'2" and fits in the passenger seat comfortably, where as on the opposite spectrum, I am 5'4" and the seat and wheel adjust well for smaller build too. Recently took it on a 1,000 mile road trip and loved every minute of it! Great storage in the hatch, and all the options are wonderful, specially the mp3 hookup in the arm rest. The sparkly blue paint is great, and didn't cost a cent extra. Absolutely love my Thumper!!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Sound system radio and mp3. It's surprisingly good quality speakers. And having not only the iPod dock, but the ability to read mp3 cds allows for hours of music with little extra need of storage for cds, etc. The hatch and cover are also GREAT!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I learn to drive in a 1954 bug and owned 1995 Golf that was a great car. The end of my VW loving history came with my purchase 10 months ago of a 2007 Rabbit. The car is a nightmare, the fuel consumption equal that of a midsize SUV and the repertoire of sounds and noises has only improved with time (the comment I got at the dealership was, if I thought I had bought a Bentley). In any case, my major complaint is with the clutch, at the dealership they maintain that there is no possibility of adjustment as some genius devised a self adjusting system that can not be altered in any way. So the fun that used to be driving a manual transmission has turn into dreadful event with this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I had never driven a VW two weeks ago. After the test drive, I was sold. Build quality is amazing. Driving it is a joy. The 2.5 PZEV 5M is no slouch. Much more than "acceptable," well beyond "competent." Not a racecar, but great torque, and amazing responsiveness in all the conditions its been through so far. For the price, I would say that my Rabbit is an amazing blend of performance, comfort, and quality. I can't even describe the feeling one gets while driving it. During the test drive, I just wanted to laugh maniacally. On paper, it doesn't look like much of an edge over the Versa, Yaris, Fit, or tC, other than performance. In person, it feels like a whole new class of vehicle.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Standard feature list is better than competition. Comfort and build quality, road feel (can't stress this enough!). Stock performance satisfying. PZEV makes me feel better about getting such mediocre gas mileage. Utility of the hatch is awesome.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Everything about this car is positive. The interior is great, the exterior is nice, and the engine is peppy.the interior is very good build quality, perhaps even upscale. The sunroof works great. Some say that it gets bad MPG, but in the real world, it only gets about 2-3 mpg less than those Japanese models that sacrifice everything to get 28 mpg in the city (real world, EPA for 2007 has been known to be inaccurate). Depending on the day, I get from 24-26 mpg in the city, and 27-32 mpg on the highway. I would rather drive a comfortable, safe, great handling, and good looking car than one that is small, uncomfortable, and one that has lackluster handling.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove all of the subcompacts that are available. I test drove them all, and came down to the conclusion that I would rather have an inexpensive car with a 6 (not 4) speed transmission, an upscale interior, a more powerful engine that can actually pass on the highway, more interior space, more comfortable seats, and better handling. This car is also much, much safer than the other competitors, especially with all of the massive SUVs out there now. We have had absolutely no problems with this car after almost 5000 miles! I would definitely buy another! My wife likes mine so much that she is going to take mine and I am going to trade in her 2005 civic for a 2008 rabbit 4dr automatic. </TEXT>

When I was shopping, I looked at Scion tC, Nissan Sentra, Honda Fit, Dodge Caliber and none of them compare with the VW's power, safety, and standard features! Everything is included in the price! Only small negative I can find is the gas mileage. It could be better but you always have to make a trade-off. I'd rather have more power and gas mileage isn't too bad. I've been averaging 22 mi/gal. 90% city driving agressively. If you're in the market for this, I would wait for the '08 model which will have 170 horses and other improvements!</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is my sixth and last VW. I am very disappointed! The suspension is extremely stiff, jarring, and very jittery. It is impossible to find any comfortable settings for the thinly padded drivers seat. Driving 300 inner-city miles a week is causing me hip and back pain! The electronic throttle programming doesn't seem compatible with the manual transmission. i.e. hard to engage the clutch smoothly. I have driven manual transmissions for 27 years and never stalled so much. I never experienced these issues with the last five VWs I have owned. Since almost all VWs are now based on the Golf V, I am now shopping for a non VW replacement.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I am completely satisfied with my choice of the VW auto. This car feels and rides just as awesome as it looks. Great passing power, even at 70 mph. Handles the local twisties with pleasant agility. I bought mine with the ground effects and it is worth the money, looks really cool and sporty. I also upgraded to 16" wheels for better ride. Just remember this changes the speedometer accuracy. I can't figure out how to sit inside with the interior dash lights on, without the driving lights blinding away at the same time (kind of irritating). Also it seems there is no glovebox light. Cruise control on the blinkers is less than desirable. The seat adjustments are poorly designed. I recommend this car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>The car definitely out shines all other cars in this price range. Performance is the name of the game on the highway. Most cars today lack handling features that are standard on the Rabbit. I test drove the competitors with fuel efficiency atop my requirements. After driving the 30+ mi/gal cars I started noticing a trend toward thinning out the suspension to ensure fluidity of movement. The difference with these fuel efficient cars and the Rabbit is severe. The Rabbit feels solid and grounded where its competitors want to go flying. A majority of my driving occurs on LA's horribly unkept roads with major obstacles every 100 yards including poor drivers with cellphones. I must be nimble.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Headroom, rear passenger space, one-touch windows, auto trans with sport mode, 16 alloys, rear lift gate latch, center a/c vent, a/c vent into glove box, front wheel drive, Rear seats 60/40 split is very easy to put down and up. Big front doors on the 2 door. Compact size and german built.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car is a very good buy. I bought this car in July 06 , had to wait some time because I purchased a 2007, not 06. I upgraded from 15 stock wheels to 16 inch alloy mag wheels, much better ride. Make sure you get ASR and stability control. 6 speed automatic tiptronic transmission is really cool! Seats are a little budget, but the car stops on a dime! Handles great!! Gas mileage is not too bad. Safety cage of vehicle is like one you would get on 35k or more vehicle. Transmission is a little tight between 20 mph and 40 mph, after that it takes off! Road noise not bad. Oil is synthetic from factory, car is made in Wolfsburg.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stock radio is loud and adjusts to road noise. Transmission 6 speed great. Inline 5 cylinder engine moves. Solid weight to the car.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Bad points that I found up until now: Seats too rigid. In a trip Montreal ? Toronto (about 500 Km) it is really difficult to be comfortable. Auto-volume control makes the lower frequency go very high if I brake. Making this option OFF solve the problem. Too much gas consumption in town, about 18.1 miles for a gallon, or 13 liters for 100 Km. On the highway, it was about 23.52 miles for a gallon, or 10 liters for 100 Km. - A constant difference of 5 Km/h between the speedometer and a GPS (at 55 real, it shows 50, at 125 it shows 120). The same GPS gadget was used on several Americans and Japanese cars and the error was about 1 Km/h, more or less.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I thought I was buying a better quality car. I was wrong. The paint is chipping in a few spots and there are lines throughout the paint that won't come out even after washing, waxing and buffing. Also there are three rattles inside that the dealership can't seem to fix. When accelerating you pick up speed until it hits 4000 rpms then it just stops accelerating. My friends say the back seat is very roomy.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I like the one touch power windows and the AUX jack (one of the main reason why I bought this car). </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Jack is the name I gave my 2007 Rabbit I bought 3 weeks ago. I LOVE my car. I looked at a Yaris, Civic, Fit, Corolla and was debating until my dad called me up and said I should test drive a Rabbit before making my decision. This car sold itself to me. I test drove it, pronounced this was the car I was getting and bought it! All my friends are jealous... in 3 weeks I've gone from 17 miles to mid 700 miles and it still makes me very happy. I was looking for a 2 door manual transmission that made driving fun. I found it and more with everything it comes with. I strongly recommend this car to anyone!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The interior blue/red lights, the look of the manual transmission, having cruise control on a car with manual tranmission, the fact that the mp3 aux. jack came standard and all the cupholders</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I purchased the 2 dr Sage Green, ABS/ESP only, w/15" steel wheels: the basic model. The ride is smooth and competent in the corners at all speeds. The engine puts out a throaty growl during accel. The pickup is superb (150 hp, 170fp of tq.), and highway cruising is excellent, with plenty of power reserve for quick escapes or conversely, with surefooted 4-wheel disk brakes to slow you down on a dime. The interior is well thought out, with driver's controls well-placed. The console lighting is especially stylish at night. Seating adjustments for a variety of driver sizes is excellent, the headroom being the most obvious. Passengers do not miss out. Folding rear seats increase cargo space.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Rabbit has numerous standard features only available as pricy extras on comp cars in its class. Best int: night illumination. Best ext: dlippery (.32) and sleek design. Mirror mounted turn sigs. Best perf: super torque/hefty brakes for city driving. Best eng: PZEV. Best of all: price.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>A reassuring, solid ride with all the peppiness you'd expect from a car that calls itself a Rabbit. I've been a long-time Civic driver and the ride quality of the Rabbit really impresses me. The Rabbit is a very refined car and an excellent value for the money. On the downside, fuel economy is not super.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling: VW makes a nicer-looking hatchback than any other maker that I've seen, and the Rabbit is even better than the Golf. Interior features: traction control/ESP, heated seat.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This new 2007 Rabbit 2dr is the perfect car for city driving. Great quality feel, good handling, good acceleration and excellent braking. I feel like I am driving a $35k luxury car! Very tight body, good vision, and great German engineering (attention to detail). The car seems well planted to the ground. You do sacrifice some fuel economy, but in return, get a very safe and stable vehicle that comes in a small package. I am very impressed with this vehicle and the many features that come standard on this car. I am on my 4th day of ownership. Everything seems to be screwed together well. I cannot comment on the reliability of my new Rabbit.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Seating is excellent. A/C is as good as I have ever experienced. Like the six speed automatic and spunky 5cyl motor. Interior trim is high quality.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This car has proved to be a sound reliable car with good quality amenities such as CD player, power windows, mirriors, doors, etc. Additionally, this car has good low end torque and it cruises and handles very well at high speeds. The car could use a little more horsepower to compliment the torque, but all in all, the car is really good.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Rabbit is by far the best inexpensive compact car available. I tried them all, and nothing compares to the solid body, secure handling, safety equipment, and controlled ride. The 4 door is very well equipped for the price with 6 airbags, heated seats, 10-speaker CD-changer audio system, 4-wheel anti-lock disk brakes, and the quality interior materials. I added ESP and the 16" alloy wheels, both of which contribute to improved handling. I have not owned the car long, but there have been no problems. My last Golf went 4 years with nothing but routine maintenance, so I'm hoping for the same with this one. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The solid body and exceptional ride. Upscale interior with heated seats and ample leg room. 175 ft. lbs. torque that comes at 2500 rpm making it useful in everyday driving. Decent stereo. ESP. Secure handling. Impeccable fit and finish. The feel of a far more expensive car. The price!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Just got the rabbit yesterday, I did a lot of research into this and other models (i.e., toyota corolla, yaris, civic, mazda3) and found this to be the most impressive out of them. I have always owned japanese, mainly toyota, and when I drove this car, I was impressed with how much more solid, and responsive it felt. I didn't feel like I was driving a heap of recycled beer cans, and it has amazing get up and go due to the 170lb/ft of torque. I would recommend this car to anyone that seriously enjoys feeling safe, and enjoying a quiet ride, without wanting to spend a ton of cash. You will not be disappointed!</TEXT>

<TEXT>The car is loaded with stock features. Options for once are just for personalization instead of need (traction contral, integrated turn signals in the mirrors,t elescopic wheel). I am 6' 2" and fit in the front and in the back. My other car is a Mercedes as is my girlfriend's, and we both are amazed at what we got for the money. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Stock stereo rocks. The car is so quiet the first few times I stopped I had to check the tach to see if the car was still running. 5 cyl engine puts competitors to shame. I can leave it in 4th in town all day, very torquey. 16" alloys only cost $400 extra. The interior screams expensive. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>We have been looking into getting a new car for a while now and we were blown away by the Rabbit. The look of the interior and exterior are great and it has way more standard features than expected. There are so many little features and neat things about this car that I feel like a salesperson every time I tell someone about it! The ride is comfortable and smooth for a car its size. It has a ton of room inside to fit four people comfortably. It handles really nicely and has a lot of power. It shifts really smoothly and quickly for being an automatic and the Tiptronic is fun to have (even though I don't really use it all that often). Seriously, this is an incredibly fun car to drive!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Everything! It has too many features to list! My favorite is probably the interior design and the great amount of power from the 5-cylinder engine. If I need to pass someone, it's almost instantly. When accelerating on the highway, there's plenty of power. You feel it pull you into your seat.</FAVORITE>

It has an excellent Teutonic design inside and out, and it has every feature you really need for your daily drive. It has top notch build quality. It is an Audi for the masses.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Rabbit is a great car in this price range. I drove some of the Japanese imports and this car beats them all as far as power, handling and ride are concerned. It's very solid and well planted as most German cars are. It's not "tinny." For the options you get, the price is right! I bought this car as a commuter car and have not been disappointed. It fits you like a glove when you drive it! Some are complaining about the gas mileage...but you can't compare it to Civics, Mazda3s, and the Yaris...etc as the horsepower and torque blow those all away. They are not in same class! You want to drive a lawnmower....then buy a Yaris or Fit!</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought an '07 Rabbit in Oct. '06. The car was great for the first 500 miles, after that a rattle started coming from the vents. I took it to the dealer and they said that the rattle was normal, they would glue the vents, but never fixed the problem. My model had the sunroof, the area with the controls would rattle. I took it to the dealer again and they never fixed it. The seat belts would rattle. The rear seat, drivers left was built in the factory with a latch that was to big. It would make a popping sound that drove me nuts. I took it to the dealer and they had my car for three days before telling me that they couldn't fix it. After about 2,000 miles, the fan blower would make random grinding noise. The moonroof would rattle and it makes a weird noise inside the car at 25-35 mph. </TEXT>

<TEXT>From the moment I bought my Rabbit, I was smitten. The 2.5 liter engine growls a bit when you step on it (which i like), but otherwise is very quiet and responsive, even in 5th gear on the freeway. The seats are firm but comfy and the dash is laid out nicely. The red-on-violet instrument cluster is complemented nicely by the soft red interior lighting...quite sexy. I didn't think the one-tap lane-change feature was such a big deal until I used it. One tap and the turn signal blinks three times without having to hold it, nice. I whittled my original list of 12 cars down to 5 and then test drove them all. The Rabbit beat them all out in the price-to-value category, big time.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I test drove a Fit, a Civic, Corolla, Matrix, Mazda3 and a Versa. The Rabbit was by far the most impressive of the bunch. I never though I'd own another VW but the Rabbit was far and away the better driving car so one is now in my driveway. Its gas mileage is better than I had expected and it handles really well. It is a great little snow car too!</TEXT>
