<TEXT>I had been looking for a Charger for my wife. I saw this SRT 8 at the dealer so I thought I would test it. It was my 1st test drive of the SRT 8. I had to hold my smiles back when I got back to the dealer office. I rated the fuel economy at 9 and that number is based on muscle car economy. I'm averaging about 20 mpg on the highway and that number would be hard to beat for such a powerful engine.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>6.1 Hemi...plain and simple is my favorite. Next would be the exterior design. Challenger proponents give me a hard time with the sedan styling..but any sedan that can give a "sucking seat" effect deserves some lee way.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I recently totaled my 08' Mazda 6 so I have been car shopping for a while now. I can honestly say that having an infant daughter, This car is everything I wanted and more. It's Sporty but can also fit a family inside. It hauls major when I need to gas it in front of the guys but also comfortable as a cloud. If you're looking for a Safe Reliable sharp looking car.

<TEXT>After looking for a car months, I finally came home with the Charger SXT. That first night all I could do was look out the window at it gleaming. The car is heavy, and the drive is smooth. Acceleration with the 3.5L is more than enough to get "into trouble" with and conservative enough to return excellent fuel economy. The car looks beautiful and ferocious, and almost everyday someone stops me to tell me so. Older people think it is a Mustang for some reason... Bottom Line is this car is amazing. It's the perfect blend of all things. If your a dad looking for a car to take the family in, but also want morph into Kasey Kane when no one is looking... This is the car for you! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Exterior styling hands down. Everyone is completely hypnotized by this car. I know that look, before I bought mine... I had that look too.</FAVORITE>

<AUTHOR>Plum Crazy SRT8</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>I have owned musclecars of all types over the last 30 years from 455CID 442's to 440 powered MOPARS and this car beats them all. Yeah, yeah it's a 4 door but so what, it crushes any of the old cars in ride, handling and especially performance. Stock 1/4 mile times in the high 12's and 0-60 in the mid to high 4 second range prove what a beast this car is. The Plum Crazy color takes me back to 1970-71 when the Dodge Scat Pack prowled the streets. The modern 6.1L Hemi is underrated at 425hp, it's closer to 450hp! That is net horsepower, not gross like in the old days. Get one while you still can because these cars will be gone forever by 2012.</TEXT>

<TEXT>For all who have the SRT8 or buy something similar, Performance & Styling must be the first thing on your mind. It can't be, or shouldn't be, gas mileage, comfort, or even reliability. Sports cars, or in this case, Muscle Cars, are a breed all to themselves. They can't be huddled with the rest of the pack. They are specialty built and because of that, stand alone. This Charger SRT8 is what Dodge set it out to be. Cool looking, fast, fun and exhilarating to drive?not to mention an attention getter. It hits the mark in those areas 100% The sound of the V8 is balanced and perfect. I can?t say enough good things about it. Buy this car if you?re in the market. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Pipe hittin' V8! The sound at start shakes the soul & gets your senses salivating for more. The seats are supportive yet very comfortable. They are not harsh in any way. It feels like a big hug. The hands free Uconnect is an excellent feature...using it a lot. The Performance Meter!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I love the look and performance of my 2007 Dodge Charger SXT. However, transmission problems have come to light that make this vehicle very unsafe. While traveling on the highway and accelerating to pass, the transmission has locked up or something and the car loses power. I have had to coast to the side of the road, stop the car, and restart it to reboot the computer. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Great car. Coming from a Mazda 626 ('01) and prior an '01 Focus, the interior is spacious. I have a couple of bigger home boys and they sit comfortably. After the dealership threw in some 20" black and chrome rims, it looks great with my gray and black tinted windows. Wish I could have afforded the V-8, but when gas was 4.75+ a gallon, I knew it was a good buy. Very quick off the start. My wife can easily fit all our kids in there which is nice when I have to use the Durango for the snow. I highly suggest it, whether it be the V-6 to the Daytona version, the Charger is the way to go. I have driven the Daytona and boy, that is a car to be driven</TEXT>

<TEXT>I bought the R/T with 33,000km, so far, did 2 oil changes at the dealer, the car is amazingly quiet and comfortable on the highway, Chrysler did a good job air-sealing this beast. Even on local roads when idling, you can barely hear that the engine is running. i get 8 L/100 km on the highway and about 15 L/100 km local, every time i fill it i get an average displayed around 13 L/100 km, now remember I drive agressively, so it's higher than regular. I did quite a bit of research before purchasing, and it's the best purchase i've ever made in my life!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>20 inch factory rims really grabs attention, the throaty mufflers are a bonus. 5.7 L engine that sounds like a corolla on the highway, but a corvette on local. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I have been driving my SRT8 Charger everyday for over a year now and I am still in love with this car. I am retired and do not have to drive, but if I look at my car I want to take it for a ride. The gas prices stopped that desire for a while so I learned how to drive the speed limit. The car is still jumpy as ever and if not for the brake dust, and the fact that the Goodyear RSA's lasted a good year/18 months, I would have no complaints. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Mean looking front end/scoop. The incredible power and adjustable ESP. The fact that you get a free SRT Track Experience with purchase. Great day of driving. </FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Fun car to drive but is expensive to maintain after 40,000 miles. Fans go out and transmission has problems. Things that you should not have problems with at this mileage are failing. I had a 95 Chevy Impala SS that did not cost as much to maintain and I kept it until 125,000 miles. If looking to buy just remember it is a "DODGE". </TEXT>

<AUTHOR>50 k miles SE</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>1 year ago when I first bought my 2007 Charger SE, used with 18k miles on it, I was driving 100 miles a day. Now its been 50k miles. I have loved driving it for every minute. My one complaint: I think I've started to hear a tiny squeak in the passenger compartment. It's the bare-bones model with the 2.7 L engine, so I get fantastic gas mileage. The only repairs have been the front wheels and suspension after a blow-out. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I get roughly 19.5 City and 26 Highway with the MDS. The car is quiet, smooth riding and very comfortable ( 6'2 , 240 )while cruising and very agile, throaty when accelerating. Dependability has been excellent thus far with 30k. The steering, seating and pedal adjustments are great for the long haul road trips. I have a 1970 Charger R/T show car and I get many compliments on the 1970 when out and about yet I also get a lot of positive comments while driving the 07. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I just purchased a 2007 Dodge Carger R/T. It rides and drives like a dream. I can set cruise at 75 mph and it feels like I'm floating. The handling could be better I've made the rear end dance around a sharp corner with esp on. I did a rolling start at 15 mph on an onramp by the end of the ramp I was at 105 mph. That 390 ft pound of torque pushes you back in the seat and shoots off the line like a slingshot. I love how quiet it is when you are driving normal, but when you nail it it's like music to my ears with the exhaust note. All in All I am very impressed with the Charger R/T. I would suggest to anyone who love quick cars to buy one.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Boston Acoustic stereo. Of course the 5.7 Hemi. The MDS feature was a selling point for me, due to traveling a lot. The "Auto Stick" is a fun feature.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I bought my 3.5 SE brand new from the dealership after an amazing test drive! It has the basic package but that was my choice. I'm 26 years old, 6'4" high and 300 lbs heavy, I reside in the UAE, where temps reach up to 122 (50 c) in the shade, and humidity up to 100% and my Charger has no trouble handling all that. Had it for a year now and no troubles what so ever... great value for money and the a/c unit is absolutely fantastic, it cools down the interior within minutes Very comfortable, visibility is great despite thick A and C pillars, cos the mirrors cover it all. I've driven lots of cars (Saab, Honda, Mitsubishi, Toyota, BMW) and none of them matches the performance of my 3.6 V6 Charger</TEXT>

<TEXT>I've read the other reviews and can't believe that no one has mentioned that it's hard to see the traffic light because of the low window. Overhead lights hard to see, have to duck down. You have to look at the traffic light to the left, in Chicago. The R/T drives like it just wants to keep going and never stop. It really takes off on the highway. City driving in Chicago is about 16/17 mpg. Haven't taken the care on a trip, but am sure the multiple displacement cylinders would do wonders for mileage. </TEXT>

<TEXT>I purchased my 2007 Silver Charger RT 5.7 Hemi in October 2007. It was a Dealer Demo with 5200 miles that already had some very nice modifications that included stainless steel dual exhaust, 20 inch wheels, and tinted windows! My personal modifications included a K&N Cold Air Intake and and an Amsoil synthetic oil system. This is the nicest car that I have ever owned. The handling, comfort, and acceleration are excellent! The leather heated seats are fantastic! I love the MDS system when cruising the interstate which is suppose to save fuel! My mileage is 18.5 city and about 25 on the interstate. Not bad for a 5.7 HEMI! My only recommendation for improvement would be for the blind spots. </TEXT>

The distinctive rumble when you step on the gas, yet ride quality is not sacrificed. The best part is that you get a great muscle car that you can take the family in. My wife loves it as well.

<TEXT>I drove a Ford Ranger for 13 yrs. I still have it and it's still running btw. But since getting my charger, I don't care to drive the ranger. I know this sounds crazy, but I've never loved a car like I do the charger. It's so fun to drive. We were not really in the market for a vehicle when we got the charger. The wife's Taurus trans was acting up, she mentioned seeing a charger on a used lot. So we go take a look. There was this sweet black charger with 22" chrome wheels. We take it for a test drive and fell in love with it. As I was sitting there signing the papers I'm thinking, I cant believe I'm buying a charger. Btw, I replaced her vss and tps in the Taurus so I get the charger all the time now</TEXT>

When i open the door to get out it always swings back shut on me. My kids always complain about the seat belt sticking. The plastic interior trim looks cheap. I got the 3.5L and I'm not very impressed with the acceleration. Gas mileage is O.K. between 20 and 23 mpg. No cup holder in the back and the cup holders it has up front are small. Should have bought a Hybrid.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Ok, I have been a Ford guy most of my life, but when the Dodge Charger came out a few years ago I knew that was the car for me! I drove the doors off my 2001 Ford Focus, suffering quietly... while watching gas prices soar. Pretty much the same story as "DVLocker". I found a stellar looking SXT at a great price and so I freakin did it! I finally bought the Charger!! All I can say is Dear God, it is everything I hoped it would be and more. It's heavy, yet remarkably nimble, feels almost armored like a Hummer. I agree the cup holders are poorly placed but seriously, there isn't a person around that doesn't love my car... maybe a SRT8 owner somewhere. Buy one right now if you can.</TEXT>

<TEXT>This is the largest and most comfortable car I've ever had. It's the basic SE version but with the 3.5L engine/5AT upgrade. This is a really roomy car! Despite the chopped off styling its not at all cramped inside. The interior is pretty simple and plain looking but I like it a lot, especially the old school straight across dashboard. I chose this car over a similarly priced midsize sedan because I really enjoy the heavy and solid ride. You can also feel that it is well balanced and turns very easily. I'm getting 17mpg per tank in heavy city traffic commuting and 27 on highway trips at 70-80.</TEXT>

Thank you Dodge for finally making a sedan with performance and styling! </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The performance, styling and room. Most performance cars have a very small back seat, barely enough for two adults. This car has room for three adults easy.

<TEXT>The car is a blast to drive. I have never owned a car that receives more attention than this car. Every where I go someone is stopping me to ask about the car or compliment me on the looks of the car. From ages of 8 to 80 people are stopping me to comment on the car. Either to tell me about the Charger they owned years ago or how much they would like to buy the current model. The down side is at every red light someone is challenging me to run it. Dodge got it right with this car. It's fast as a bullet; stops on a dime; and corners like it's on rails. Some complain about the fact they made it a sedan, but from my perspective the car is the best of both worlds.</TEXT>

<TEXT>I absolutely love this car. It's everything you would want - drives like a muscle car and rides like a luxury car. I looked at it for a year and just couldn't shake the desire. So glad I bought it. I have a 15 year old son and a 3 year old daughter and both think it's so cool. My daughter has named it "The Big Red Car" after the Wiggles song (it's TorRed) and constantly tells people how fast it is. All my girlfriends refer to it as my "guy magnet." When out cruising, no doubt I will get several "Woo-hoos." Anyone considering this car should go for it. The only thing I don't like is the gas mileage because I drive city miles and it's getting 13 mpg. Great fuel economy on the highway though.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Controls/computer on the steering wheel. Sunroof. Sirius radio. ESP. Very comfortable seats. This car has the best looking front end (grill) on any car on the road. I like how high the car sits - good for my back/posture. Also like the chunky body - looks massive and powerful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is a a classic muscle car in that it's loud and a bit heavy. Other than that, it's fun to drive! My kids love riding in this car - I can't be more than a mile from the house before I hear, "Hit it, Dad!". </TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded up from a Mustang GT because I wanted the performance but needed the room. This 4000+ pound vehicle handles better and goes faster than the Mustang. I bought it for performance not mileage, so the gas pump doesn't scare me. This is the new generation muscle car that you will see in car shows for years to come.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The seats are more comfortable and hold onto you when you corner sharply. The dash is laid out well with easy to see and reach controls. The electronics display is very useful.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>This is really a fun car to drive. Ride and handling are great. A terrific highway vehicle. When you step down on the gas, it goes. Mileage is about 22 MPG on the highway, 19 around town. I stand 6' 5" and I have plenty of head and leg room, front and rear. Has a big trunk, and rear seats fold forward to accommodate long items.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Checked out lots of cars and SUVs prior to purchase. The Charger beat all of them hands down. The car looks great, drives like a sports car and rides like a Cadillac. One of the few that offered AWD in my price range and had an excellent rebate as well. I needed something to haul the kids around in that wasn't boring.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>AWD, Hemi, Sirius, leather, exhaust note. Base sound system is excellent. Quality of construction, paint, the engine compartment is even cool. Washing the car is easy as well.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>Now I've only had my RT for a short period of time, but I've been amazed at the quality of the handling and the ride. I moved up from a Saab 9-3 so it's nice to feel like I have enough room to stretch out. This car is big. Very big. Yet it drives like a sports car. The ride is soft, though not too cushy, and the handling is quite responsive. In fact, I was debating whether to buy a new Charger or a lightly-used Jaguar XJR. Yes, I actually preferred the ride and handling of the Charger over a car that costs nearly $90k new. The downside: the mileage. It actually does get pretty good highway mileage (20+ mpg), but I average about 12 mpg in Southern California commuter driving.</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>I'd be lying if I didn't love the Hemi! I bought the Road & Track package, which has the upgraded seats; they really cradle you. I'm impressed with how nimbly a car of this size handles.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>It is a great car and really fun to drive. Powerful and fast. Thank God for cruise control. I am really pleased and excited to drive my Charger. What a big change from driving the Camaro, no longer have to fall in or crawl out. Love it!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>The Hemi of course. It runs great and sounds great. You will be noticed driving this car. Heads turn and people will stop to look. Gas mileage is decent and better than I had expected. In normal driving situations I am averaging 22mpg. Driving fast though I only get 19mpg. But still not bad.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>The Charger is a wonderful vehicle that loves to move. I have to say it's the first automatic I've driven that doesn't mind going past the red line. The only downer is that I had it back in the shop after 11 days for a malfunctioning rocker in the engine. The dealership fixed it and it's been better ever since. When I first got in it, I thought the interior was too plain, but the smooth and sporty ride is what sold me.</TEXT>

<TEXT>The Charger is a great looking muscle car like the Mustang, only is suitable for families. The Charger also has features the Mustang lacks at 30K such as heated seats, rear DVD, and a GPS. I purchased a Mango Daytona, and I love it. The only downside is the cheap doors, but I guess they have to do something to make money off of a 350hp car with a plethora of features.</TEXT>

<TEXT>Just got the sub lime R/T Daytona for my wife at Christmas and the only drawback is I have a hard time getting it from her. This car is trully awesome. The interior is way cool. The best part is our son's car seat. I love looking at the poor souls in minivans and boring cars and to see their facial expressions. I constantly get complements, and other guys with Beemers and Benzes wishing they had one. At almost less than half the price of their less styled cars. I highly recomend getting the lime green monster and if you missed out on getting 1 of the 1500 of these try your luck on the plum purple next. Way fast family car. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Plenty of room in back seat for passengers. Enough get up and go to merge or say fuggettaboutitt to that yellow light. Handling is responsive. I wish the rear had a sporty look like the front! Haven't had this much fun driving since my Trans Am. I love the electronic stability control. This I could feel when driving in "monsoon" season. I have to disagree with the previous review about not enough acceleration to beat other cars. I can put myself wherever need be. It isn't called high output for nothing!</TEXT>

<TEXT>Traded in 2004 Dodge SRT-4 for roomier and more comfortable car. I'm not pro- Dodge, it just happens to be the roomiest, least expensive RWD 4 door sedan on the market. After a high performance FWD car, I wanted something that wouldn't rip my arms off with torque steer. The R/T was what got me looking at the Charger in the first place but I ended up leasing the SXT model beacuse of overall cost. Being 6'6" I needed something I didn't have to curl into a ball to fit into. Only had it for a week but am very pleased with the Charger so far. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Wanted one for a while now and finally bought it about a month ago. Already put 2,500 miles in it! So far the back seat cushion needed to be replaced because a seam came undone, the driver's power window will need to be repaired because it is extremely noisy when being rolled up and makes noise when driving and the headliner makes a terrible rattle when driving over bumps or rough pavement. It is because of these small teething problems that I have mixed thoughts on my purchase. I love driving the car and especially love the styling but this is becoming extreme. I read in a forum that the headliner noise is "common" on cars equiped with a sunroof so keep this in mind when choosing your car!</TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Factory navigation and 6 CD changer. I have the upgraded Boston Acoustics stereo in mine and it rocks. Sounds very very good. The seats are very comfortable on long trips and I have the heated ones. Very roomy back seat. No one complained once on a 300 mile trip. Very roomy trunk.</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>If you are looking for a 70's muscle car (albeit four doors) with modern features this is it. I love the car's looks and the 420 ft/lbs of torque at the rear wheels.

You either want a car like this with these attributes or you don't.</TEXT>

I have 2 kids in car seats and there is plenty of room for them in the back seat. The traction control is the best I ever used. Being in Wisconsin I thought the rear wheel drive was a bad thing. The charger traction control is better than the FWD with traction control Honda Oddysey my wife drives. She prefers driving the Charger when she can.

<TEXT>Coming from a 2004 V8 Nissan Titan, I have to say that I'm impressed with the 3.5 V6 engine, and I can only imagine how the Hemi would feel. The gas saving is big, again coming from a full size truck, but is OK comparing to a regular sporty sedan. Lots of room inside, and very comfortable. The design could have been better, it looks "long", but it's still nice looking! Maybe a 2 door like it should be? The rims on the lower packages need redesigning, I don't know why they still offer steel wheels with hubcaps. The wheels don't get better until you reach the R/T package, just not fear. </TEXT>
<FAVORITE>Very comfortable seats, huge interior, awesome 3.5 engine power, high interior quality, awesome gauge cluster design, and very affordable prices. Interiorwise, the Charger is A+, for the buck. I absolutely love the front end design!</FAVORITE>

<TEXT>I traded my 2000 BMW 528i for this Dodge. I was hesitant that I would not enjoy my Charger as much. Wrong! Excellent car. Good gas mileage and sporty styling. I am always getting compliments. And the ride is better then the Bimmer. I wish Dodge would go the extra mile and give the minor touches that would put the car over the edge.ie.. lighted vanity mirrors, light in glove compartment, auto adjusting rear view mirror and more cup holders. Also move the cruise control to the steering wheel. Overall very pleased. American muscle with European refinement. </TEXT>

<TEXT>Engine sounds great. The steering is responsive, the brakes are good. The handling is fine if you don't ask it to dance. Body motions are fairly well controlled. It's rear-wheel drive (no torque steer!) The body structure is solid. The fit is satisfying, the room is plentiful, the trunk size is fine for a car this big. The base radio sounds surprisingly nice and the car has presence. The bad: Mail slot windows are claustrophobic. Thick front and rear pillars block things you should be able to see. The engine is weak, and the car is heavy (3780lbs!). The steering is too light and does not give good feedback. The car is slow to get off the line, can't turn off traction control.</TEXT>
